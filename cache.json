The main focus of this release is the ability to serve Swagger UI from the server with ease and ability to create clients from the same code as servers. I'm happy to confirm that both goals are reached with this release. \n The tutorial for library was created.\n Also there are many other improvements:\n  \nOpenApi schema for servers\n swagger servers support (we can add swagger to server with one line of code: withSwagger def server )\n clients from the same code as servers\n redesign of internal types\n redesign of DSL for routes\n many ergonomic improvements\n packages for extra utils\n split of mig package to several packages: \n mig - core\n mig-wai - rendering servers to wai apps\n mig-client - clients\n mig-extra - extra utils\n mig-server - mig servers with batteries\n mig-swagger-ui - swagger ui server\n \n tutorial and quickstart guide on github pages\n CI for repo with formatter, build and tests and update of docs on github pages\n  \nThe internal type for Servers was redesigned so that we assemble handler function with API description at the same time. In the first release it was just handler function under the hood.\n As a refresher mig is a family of libraries to write lightweight, simple, type-safe and composable servers. It strives to be in the middle ground between scotty and servant. To be composable, flexible and type-safe as servant and simple and lightweight in concepts as scotty.\n Thanks to Ambros for contribution. Also I'd like to thank authors of packages servant, servant-swagger-ui and servant-openapi3 packages for inspiration for my work in this release. Many lines of code are influenced by those packages.\n Links: * github * tutorial * examples * mig on hackage also see packages mig-server and mig-client.\n    submitted by    /u/anton-kho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.17 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This release introduces compatibility with what4 versions up to 1.5.1, and replaces several functions in copilot-core. The second change is a breaking change: the functions replaced have been deprecated and new alternatives introduced instead.\n As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Jan 7th, 2024.\n In our last announcement, we mentioned that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-libraries and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].\n There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!\n Ivan\n [1] https://github.com/nasa/ogma\n [2] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/releases/tag/v3.17\n [3] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot\n [4] https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, some things are getting in the way:\n  \nHow do I make the value of parameter number absolute? In Kotlin, I just have to make a new variable that holds the absolute value of the parameter in a line, making it more ‘step to step’. But in Haskell, I don't even know if it's possible to do that in functions.\n Why does when I remove the recur 1 _ = True line from the Haskell code, it only evaluate 1–6 as true? I tried to make a list of numbers 1–256, filtered using this function with recur 1 _ = True removed, and the result is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. If it were correct, it should still produce [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,…, 250, 256]. I also tried to change it into recur 5 _ = True or other numbers, and the resulting list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,…] followed by Hamming numbers divisible by that number. What is recur 1 _ = True really? How to remove it if it's okay to?\n  \nAny help is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Typhoonfight1024  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit.

          "description": "So, by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem no system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an algorithm can provide a proof of it's own consistency. Knowing that set theory is one such system, I began to wonder whether it's possible to write a program, for which it's impossible to prove that it never stops. Such a program, I imagine, would be able to describe set-theoretic theorems as values of some data type, then, given a set of axioms, combine those axioms using logic to form all the theorems of set theory. Then traverse those theorems and check if any of them are equivalent to a negation of one of the axioms, thus proving that set theory is inconsistent and causing the program to halt. For a program like that, you can't show that it never stops, because that would require showing that set theory is consistent, which is impossible to do using set theory. The problem is, I have no idea how to write a program like that or where to even start. I thought haskell would be a good choice, because it's already pretty close to math.

          "description": "Some statically typed languages that have null provide null safety by having a nullable and non-nullable version of each type. The compiler will prevent you from using null when the non-nullable version of the type is expected. You can pass in the plain non-null version of the type into any function that takes in the nullable type. The nullable type is a union between the non-nullable type and null.\n Kotlin is a good example of a language like this. Typescript kinda mostly does it. I don't know C# very well but I think the latest version finally fixed the initial nightmare they started with.\n Haskell, on the other hand, has Maybe. Maybe is a sum type, rather than a union type. If a function takes in a Maybe String, then you can't pass a String into the function.\n One advantage nullable types have over Maybe is that it's backwards compatible to weaken preconditions and strengthen postconditions. \n If your library has a function\n fun doIt(foo: String): Int?\n Then in the next version, you can change the signature to\n fun doIt(foo: String?): Int\n In a backwards compatible way. In Haskell, changing\n doIt :: String -> Maybe Int\n To \n doIt :: Maybe String -> Int\n Is a breaking change.\n Is there an advantage to representing optionality as a unique sum type, rather than a nullable union type?\n    submitted by    /u/shrinking_dicklet  \n [link]   [comments]",

The highlight of this release is that vty now works on Windows, thanks to hard work by Chris Hackett and Timofey Zakrevskiy! For years, many people in the Haskell community have requested Windows support in vty. Thanks to Chris and Timofey for the time and energy they put into this, and their patience as we worked out an approach! Thanks also to Eric Mertens and Kevin Quick for early feedback on the release.\n In this release, the core \"vty\" package was reorganized so that support for specific platforms now lives in platform-specific packages that need to be used alongside the core \"vty\" package. This release includes the release of three aditional new packages:\n  \nvty-unix (Unix terminal support previously provided by \"vty\")\n vty-windows (the Windows backend)\n vty-crossplatform (for when you want to support both)\n  \nThe core package still provides all of the important library functionality and is still a necessary dependency. Applications will need to depend on an additional package for the platform that they need to support. When in doubt, use vty-crossplatform!\n The release changelog update has a detailed listing of changes as well as instructions for how to update your application to work with Vty 6.\n To get help, please open an issue on the Vty repository.\n While I'm at it, Brick has been updated to use vty-crossplatform in version 2.0!\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jtdaugherty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am aware of the Cloud Haskell project but it seems to be abandoned and it feels a bit too heavyweight for the task. The bindings for unix IPC I could find on hackage look a bit half-baked or very low-level or don't have queue functionality. ZeroMQ? Never used it, so no opinion.

With Erules, you can define rules clearly and evaluate them on various data types concisely.\n Step 1: Import the Library\n To get started, add Erules as a dependency to your Scala project. You can do this in the build.sbt file with the following declaration:\n scala libraryDependencies += \"com.github.geirolz\"…",

          "description": "A recent post got me thinking about how we might go about extracting nested optional values with the convenience of Kotlin and TypeScript, but while still leveraging Scala's rich monadic types. Odersky's comment on another post indicated a way to reproduce a version of the ? syntax using Scala's boundary/break. His example works only with A | Null values, however. I wanted to see if I could accomplish the same while:\n  \nSupporting ? on any optional/failable type,\n Preserving failure types by returning an Either and tracking any failure types encountered in the get chain, and\n Still avoid any intermediate allocations (only construct the Either at the end)\n  \nYou can see my attempt in this gist\n The syntax is:\n val result: Either[F1 | F2 | F3, A] = getEither(obj1.?.obj2.?.obj3) \n Where F1, F2, and F3 are the failure types of obj1, obj2, and obj3. Option fails with Unit, Try fails with Throwable, and Either fails with its left type.\n I'm doubtful I'd ever actually use this: having to a) import `getEither` and `?`, b) wrap the statement in `getEither`, and c) add a dot before each `?` seems like just a little more would make me skip the usual syntax, but it was fun and interesting to work out how to do it. I'd be curious to hear others' thoughts.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Along similar lines, it occurred to me that you could produce an implementation of Option that has no allocation overhead. You can check out my attempt at that here. It just uses A | Null under the hood as an opaque type. It's two limitations that I know of are:\n  \ntoString does not show None or Some(x) but null and x (this is just a limitation of opaque types)\n I can't figure out a way to implement exhaustive extractors. Instead, you can use the fold method (which I've been using more and more these days anyways)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/jivesishungry  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm thinking this entire folder is considered one project, and you can only have one entrypoint in main. Is this right?\n I put extends App in List, and then I could run and debug things in List.

But it seems in Scala it's very specific in terms of how def main() can appear.\n https://preview.redd.it/wynjw7x48myb1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=02fec652be47aa0e318d5a1ddbcbd7eaad81566e\n    submitted by    /u/maraskooknah  \n [link]   [comments]",

It also has no dependencies (aside from scalatest).\n I intend on improving things like performance and adding a few features to make it a bit nicer before making it to 1.0.

The general concept is to use existing projects to handle some of the details and make it easier to experiment with the unique features of the language. These ideas also try to avoid a lot of the standard web application implementation details that are usually covered in courses or books.\n ​\n  \nWrite a ui for hledger https://hledger.org/ . One already exists, but if you store the transactions as text blobs in a database and dump out hledger text files based on different things you want to do you could experiment with: \n Making projections by generating future transaction entries\n Running \"what if\" scenarios by filtering out past transactions and replacing them with generated transactions\n Different ways of tagging/categorizing/automating transactions \n \n Write a toy version of Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/ . Create a file format that describes a set of containers, read the file format, and use the shell `docker` (or `podman`) command to poll/start/stop the containers. You can experiment with different ways to start up different subsets of containers, ways of swapping different types of containers for different roles ...etc.\n Write a ui for MegaMek https://megamek.org/ . One already exists but mostly the idea is to use the existing game rules implementation and focus on experimenting with language features. Not sure how feasible this one is.\n Implement the ActivityPub protocol to create a Mastodon server. Not sure how good this one is for learning but there are probably a lot of interesting choices to make.\n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/stevechy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Considering the significant psychological distress this has caused on multiple occasions, and Travis' close association with Typelevel's leadership, will the steering committee address and condemn his cyberstalking tactics? Should the community be concerned about it happening again? \n \nOver the years, Typelevel's approach to cancellation campaigns has often been riddled by conflicts of interest, as targets were direct competitors.

          "description": "I'm a data engineer who has worked mostly in Python. I have some academic experience in C/C++. I've tried learning Spark in the past through a book, but wasn't picking up the concepts. I came across rockthejvm through this sub. He sells a Spark course, but in the FAQ, he doesn't recommend doing the Spark course if you haven't learned Scala. So I started with the Scala course. I'm finding the explanations to go superficially deep, and explaining a lot of concepts. I'm in the generics lesson right now, and I'm looking back at the older lessons, and I wouldn't be able to complete the exercises on my own after some time.\n Is there a better way? The best way for me in the past is to just come up with a project and start coding. My ultimate goal is to learn Spark well. If that means getting a decent fluency in Scala, then I'm ok with it, but I'm just not picking up the concepts of Scala well with this learning method.\n    submitted by    /u/maraskooknah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Functions allow you to generate large configurations without repeating information; types and contracts help detect problems early when the configuration is malformed and determine where the problem is.\nIn the JSON world, the role of contracts is served by JSON Schemas, which likewise specify the form that some JSON-encoded data should have.

I'm very much still a noob.\n One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I'm making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).\n For example, I'd write something like the below and need to type \"Big/Small Important Work Project\" a number of times with my big fat fingers:\n ``` ** Big Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project\n ** Small Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project\n ``` (Note, I don't actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)\n In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone \n I therefore get tasks like \"call amit\" or \"book room\" a lot, devoid of context.\n Question:\n Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children? Maybe appended to them?\n I realise this is not nessecarily an Org, or emacs, problem but I hope I can solve it programatically in emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/thephatmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c \n Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under `Task b...` only to find its empty.\n A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b \n The above code shows as:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Donut_7527  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I use org mode for practically everything in my note-taking, journaling and work tracking)\n I do, as the podcast describes, search for code snippets and pointers or ideas when prototyping code, sometimes it is content I can use right away or it can be something I just think is neat and possibly use in the future. But I don't have what I think is a great way of storing and retrieving this material.\n I use org-dailies every day for journaling and tag the posts for high-level topics, and org-roam for my comprehensive reading and research. But for programming journaling this really is me remembering to file the write-up (in org-daillies) at the end of the day or work on a project on that day, but it's not ideal for capturing quick text notes or excerpts from web pages etc. \n Are there good ways to track short snippet-like research detail and even auto-tag the entries with language, target project etc. in org mode? \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/redoakprof  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Help!\n I have recently transitioned to a custom workflow that relies on org-agenda to track progress on all the projects my team is working on. Overall, I'm very happy about it: I have a cron job that polls the jira server for updated tickets and refreshes a cache of org files, one per ticket. I wrote my Jira-org bridge and I render jira comments and changelog items one per org item with timestamps, and org-agenda does a fantastic job at showing me all updates, from the respective users. I can open any day and see very nicely what everybody in the team has done. I press capital E and I can even see excerpts of the comments they posted. So far, absolutely fantastic. It's literally better and faster than using the Atlassian tools in the web.\n Two things I don't like:\n (1) - all the org files are opened as individual buffers. It's hundreds of them. Low hundreds but still hundreds. I understand that org-agenda needs to index and reindex them, and also needs to \"remotely\" update their contents from the agenda view... but why keep them open in a buffer all the time? Can't org be configured to lazy open them only on a change?\n (2) - initial indexing is slow and will likely get slower every week. I don't mind it for now, because it's a price I only pay on a monday morning, and I can even hide it under the emacs server start that I do in crontab @ reboot... but I'm concerned about the long term sustainability of the solution. By nature, jira tickets will keep growing and growing over time. I only index the ones incurring active changes... but still. Is there a way to better control indexing costs? Is there a way to speed things up? Navigating from one week to another is starting to be a little slow. Yes this is hundreds of tickets and thousands of events, but in 2023 that's nothing in terms of data sizes contemporary software handles. Are there tricks to speed org-agenda up?\n    submitted by    /u/cazzipropri  \n [link]   [comments]",

But this is an awkard general solution, as it requires these entries to use a different syntax to normal agenda items. I'm just wondering if anyone's got a more integrated approach by now? I imagine this might use something like -7d in the timestamp, or a WARNING_PERIOD property.\n    submitted by    /u/arapede  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a good org-super-agenda config that I've been using happily for months.\n The issue I have is that out of the myriad of tasks I have available to work on at any one point, I am not good at just picking one and getting on with it. Almost like flicking through Netflix and never actually deciding what to watch.\n Might be more of a behavioral problem, but I wondered if anyone has a function or utility for picking a task at random from a given org buffer and highlighting it in a new buffer, or similar. Idea being this would force selection from a set of tasks you know you could progress.\n Or has anyone got good suggestions on how to tackle picking a next task on which to spend time? I don't think it's necessarily bad task definition, and it's also not that they should be someday/maybe tasks to which I'm not firmly committed.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/redoakprof  \n [link]   [comments]",

(?s . ,type-name) ...)) \n to generate a doc-string, and got an unexpected error\n Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (1 . 1) 0) \n upon start-up, due to a function some-type-p being called without arguments under the new behavior, instead of interpolating it as symbol-name.\n Order of execution\n This was especially confusing, due to the introduction of a dependence on the order of execution.

As depicted in fig.1, visual-line-mode doesn't really handle overly-long lines (e.g. due to URLs) well. Disabling it entirely makes a bad overall trade-off in files containing mostly textual lines (fig.2).\n It could improve by allowing line-breaks on some non-whitespace characters (like \"-\" or \"/\") or simply disabling visual-line-mode entirely for \"words\" that anyway need more than one line. Better yet, for any word exceeding a maximum character-length (e.g. 50) in order to better handle lines containing a few words, but also a moderately long URL (e.g. when using the markdown syntax [link name](link url)).\n I've found no existing options in the M-x customize interface, nor any relevant packages in M-x package-list-packages (including MELPA).\n Fig.1 When breaking long \\\"words\\\" like URLs, visual-line-mode is not very smart about where to break the lines.\n Fig.2 For URLs, having no visual-line-mode line breaks active would be preferable, but the disadvantage of disabling visual-line-mode for lines with actual text is too big to just disable visual-line-mode entirely.\n    submitted by    /u/R3D3-1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been using Magit and Forge for several years, mainly with projects on self-hosted Gitlab instances. The experience has been great!\n One of the nice things that Forge did for me was showing the numbers of merge requests (in !123 form) in my magit-log views. Some time ago, however, this stopped working. Actually, this stopped working quite some time ago, maybe a year or more. I was too lazy to report it and too busy to investigate. IIRC it didn't stop working right away for all repos, so I guess it is not related to e.g. upgrading to Emacs 28 (and it was definitely before I upgraded to Emacs 29.1). \n To investigate this in more detail, I created new clones of several projects, but that didn't change anything. I also tried a simplified Emacs config in a new home directory to make sure that Forge's database was created from scratch. Same problem persists. \n On Forge's Github pages, I found some references to interactions of Forge with bug-reference-mode, so maybe it somehow has to do with that? On the other hand, given that I used a fresh Emacs config + new clones, I guess this isn't the cause of the issue either. \n Does anyone know how to get the MR numbers back in Magit's log view?\n    submitted by    /u/ph0t0nix  \n [link]   [comments]",

But if in the same window (outside of emacs) I ssh to a server (that has an identical init.el) and run the same, the colors are way off. I'm looking for advice (beyond \"use TRAMP\") for how to get better theme colors over ssh.\n In both cases the value of $TERM is xterm-256color. The output of msgcat --color=test is the same in both shells. But in emacs the output of M-x list-color-display is quite different in the two cases: in the local window there are 556 colors with many descriptive names, but in the ssh context there are 256 colors with limited names (color-NNN for NNN in 16 through 255).\n    submitted by    /u/fredy  \n [link]   [comments]",

This approach works quite alright, but I am struggling to make it work with another recent addition to my workflow, `desktop.el`.\n I want to use `desktop` to save opened files, window and tab bar configurations. After some tinkering this also works out fine, however, when I use `desktop-read` on a constellation that contains org-mode buffers, it seems like darkroom-mode is applied twice, i.e. the font is even bigger than with normal `darkroom-mode` applied.\n I have tried to use `desktop-after-read-hook` to re-initialize `darkroom-mode`:\n ```\n (defun or/re-initialize-darkroom ()\n (progn\n (darkroom-mode -1)\n (darkroom-mode +1)))\n ```\n However, this does not seem to work, because the text still is oversized. If it were only for one tab or buffer where this is the case, I'd swallow that pill. However, it is the case in all org buffers, which is a tad too annoying with four tabs containing four different org files.\n Thus, I'd love to hear about your experiences, maybe you've got a tip or two for me?\n Have a good day!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is my favorite terminal emulator of the bunch (yes even over vterm) and has actually improved my workflow. It does not need an external C library to be downloaded and in my opinion has the best keybindings of any terminal emulator I have tried. It has 3 main modes to cycle between:\n  \nInput Mode (C-c C-e) = similar to vterm's copy mode the buffer becomes \"frozen\" for you to copy the text and scroll back and basically use all of emacs's nifty search features.\n Char Mode (C-c M-d) = One of my favorite modes where basically every input you make short of the keys C-M-m or M-RET will be sent to the terminal. This means I can open vim/nano/emacs -nw all within the terminal buffer (which I do a lot as I ssh into machines regulary) and it works absolutely perfectly. \n Semi-Char Mode: The default mode where most inputs will be sent to the terminal. This mode does 90% of the job but if sometimes you have a weird mix of alt and control input combinations to send then the Char Mode is there for you.\n  \nJust wanted to bring more attention to this pacakage and would recommend others to try it a bit.\n Thank you /u/AkibAzmain for creating and maintaining this package.\n https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat\n    submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have the entire elpa directory added into a git repository so that I always have a known good setup that I can fall back on. This works well when I am cloning it in linux machines but when I clone it in windows machines, it doesn’t work.\n I have removed all the .elc files since those are not cross compatible but it still didn’t work and I realise that it’s because the generated autoload file is specified to be using unix style line endings (LF) but when I cloned it in the windows machine, the autoload files will have dos style line endings (CRLF) therefore causing the issue.\n Interestingly, the init file also uses CRLF and it still works presumably because it does not have the same specified coding as the generated autoload files.\n How should I get around this problem? I’m thinking of setting core.autocrlf to false on my windows machine. While that works, I will have to remember to create new files in my .emacs.d with only LF to keep the git repo clean and also presumably for it to work. I also thought about regenerating those autoloads after a clone but I’m not sure how to do so. Hence, I’m looking to see whether others have better solutions to this problem.\n Edit: I realise I can set core.autocrlf to input so that git will automatically convert any CRLF to LF on commit therefore resolving the issue. Regardless, I am still interested to hear from the others who version control their elpa directory on what is their strategy.\n    submitted by    /u/rorrryyyy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c \n Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under Task b... only to find its empty.\n A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b \n The above code shows as:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b \n Any better solutions?\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Donut_7527  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm starting my journey on Vim and possibly Emacs (although, who am I kidding, seeing some of its capabilities it seems an inevitability). One thing that would accelerate my timeline to jumping into learning Emacs is if it handled a particular use case that is crucial to me.\n See, I do a lot of work in Jupyter Notebooks (Python) for school and ML/prototyping in general. One thing I like about notebooks is that if you make a mistake and the program fails, well, your intermediate calculations are still stored in memory and accessible. It's a graceful fail. If you fail through terminal, well, could be the end of what you calculated. \n The problem I have with Jupyter Notebooks is that they do not support parallel processing conveniently. I saw that Emacs has some interesting capabilities around notebook support; I believe org mode is what's used. \n I was interested in knowing if anyone uses Emacs as a way to get the best of both worlds: a way to run things using multiprocessing, but should things fail, it store the states in memory to rerun it.\n I appreciate any/all insight you have!\n    submitted by    /u/AnalystOrDeveloper  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey there.\n I'm a fan of Emacs, like you folks.\n I use Emacs org every day, mainly for my teaching class. Furthermore, I learn Emacs for three years ago.\n But I struggle to achieve my learning of Elisp. For example, taping lisp and elisp code with evil/lispy is a true nightmare (I use Prelude with few modes, btw), not to mention when I type code block within org.\n I knew the learning curve is hard. But I didn't expect that much frustration to learn it. The documentation is austere. So few examples are given. There is too little blogs or books about Emacs, specifically about org and babel.\n To illustrate my point, let's take the *this* variable in babel, that I found TODAY by CHANCE in this page : https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html.\n It's a game changer for a lot of my code, and would deserve a whole page to illustrate it. But no, it's given in a «niche» example.\n Don't be mistaken, I found Babel/Org/Emacs wonderful, but what a pain in the ass to learn it !\n For such an old and wise piece of software, I can't understand why we don't have a smooth learning experience with Emacs. A lot of people could benefit Org/Emacs, without the big hinder of the «lack» of documentation (mostly examples).\n Am I the only one to experience this ?\n Edit : *this* is not a \"kind of macro\" but simply a variable.

          "description": "I love git worktrees. It took me a while to change my workflow and get used to doing things differently, but it is so much better. I never have to think \"oh my repo is in inconsistent state, I can't switch my focus and start reviewing this PR, I need to first stash/commit/stage/etc. my stuff...\"\n I also love how Magit lets me create a worktree from a PR or an Issue (some of that is built-in, some I extended to fit my workflow). One thing is still missing though.\n Cloning or starting a new repo in a practical way to be used with worktrees, for me, always requires some manual process.\n First, I need to follow the recommendation I borrowed from this blogpost: How to use git worktree and in a clean way. It boils down to:\n mkdir my-awesome-project $ cd my-awesome-project $ git clone --bare git@github.com:myname:my-awesome-project.git .bare $ echo \"gitdir: ./.bare\" > .git \n But when I do that, git doesn't see remote branches anymore. So some stuff won't work as normally expected. For that, I have to follow this advice from SO, basically adding to ./bare/config:\n [remote \"origin\"] fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* \n And now I'm thinking, before I try to automate this. Maybe Magit already does the right thing and I just never knew about it? Or maybe it's much simpler than that and all that manual hocus-pocus is not needed?\n How do you use worktrees with Magit? And if you don't use worktreees, why is that? Is there even a better way?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not long ago, they started detecting ad blockers in the browser while browsing YouTube, so as a company, they can change whatever they want overnight.\n I want to emphasize that I don't have a lot of money to spare, and I'm taking this step more for my peace of mind, to make sure I won't have any issues in the future. However, I would still like to ask for your advice, are you satisfied with Fastmail, have you had any problems with their service while using Mu4e and Emacs?\n I've noticed that they also support a feature called 'masked mail' and an option to add additional emails. If, for example, I want to display an email address on my CV that isn't my primary address and I'd like to deactivate it at some point, would it be better to use the option to add a new address or the \"masked mail\" option instead?

Finally I made a whole document with full details on the server in that point in time, which was pretty interesting as I could have this as a template for future incidents and have certain commands saved for this.\n And I got the idea, wouldn't it be interesting to have org mode files like these but for testing specific vulnerabilities?, even using a tool like NixOS or Guix to make commands that will get the old version x.x.x of nginx and I could test a vulnerability there, so it is also reproducible and everyone can use the org file and test this vulnerability?, basically more of a study and proof of concept rather than something more 'heavy' as in business related.\n ​\n Does anyone have a similar use case?, I would love to hear for them as I want to go into the DFIR route.\n ​\n TLDR.

I would like to be able to ignore matches, if terms (let's name them excludees) are found in the next 5 lines from the search string match or within a number of lines defined by a variable.\n It would allow to save excludees as a list, and ignore certain matches when for instance the \"ERROR\" relates to a known bug, and we do not want to see it in occur searches any longer.\n Ideally, this could be triggered by a keymap in occur-mode-map, (toggle-ignore-excludees), so that it is up to the user to activate it or not.\n is there already a similar function that does it? How would you proceed to achieve this?\n thanks for your feedback\n    submitted by    /u/fmou67  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use pdf-tools for reading and recently started using bookmark+ and dired+ for navigating. Unfortunately these two great packages seems to conflict. \n One of the issues I noticed was that the bookmark+ command for bookmarking a pdf location in a pdf-tools buffer didn't work; it gave an empty buffer warning. Turns out bookmark+ creator Drew Adams had already suggested a workaround which I discovered here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/72786/bookmark-plus-and-pdf-tools-pdf-view-error\n So that solved or at least patched that issue. But then I noticed that with dired+ installed and any fairly large pdf opened in pdf-tools, emacs will freeze if you attempt to do dired-jump or helm-find-files. Dired-jump without dired+ is not affected by the size of the pdf at all and just opens the underlying directory immediately. But with dired+ anything above about 1mb or so hangs it for quite a while, anything around 10mb or more just freezes it for minutes on end to the point that unless you want to go make yourself lunch and coffee, you will have to force kill emacs to keep working.\n As a noob, non-techie, non-developer, I just wanted to ask, what is the right way of asking about possibly getting this issue fixed, because I love these two packages and would love to have both in working order, but obviously don't have the coding know how to do it myself. Of course if anybody knows of a fix that's already out there for this issue, I'd love to know about that as well.\n    submitted by    /u/jcdix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am not skilled in drawing, but after trying PlantUML, I found that I can create visual representations directly using code. This has greatly aided my spatial imagination. \n Take, for example, the usecases diagram:\n @startuml :user: -right-> (Right) :user: -up-> (Up) @enduml \n https://preview.redd.it/1bx7h7sa7vub1.png?width=152&format=png&auto=webp&s=6271256f6855b88a93a62abf63569f1bc542ded5\n With the use of directional terms like \"up\" and \"right,\" you can intuitively draw the diagram as shown. it lowers barrier for non-artists - no drawing ability needed and focuses thought process on structural elements and relationships. \n When immersed in text, our spatial imagination can often become less active. For example, when trying to imagine the hierarchical structure of an article such as org-mode, our mental representation tends to be more like a bullet structure in an editor, rather than a graphical tree structure. \n PlantUML addresses the challenge of limited spatial imagination by providing an intuitive text-graph syntax. One notable feature is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) functionality.\n Consider the following example:\n @startwbs !theme mono Emamcs ** Texting Editing ** Note taking ** File Manager ** Literature Programming @endwbs \n https://preview.redd.it/95b2mg6w9vub1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0f00c54e4d411ec731eba7b23a46a665ed78fc\n The WBS feature in PlantUML facilitates the effortless transformation of a vertical structure into a horizontal representation. This allows me to mentally interpret and visualize the PlantUML code, automatically converting the vertical structure into a spatially-oriented horizontal structure in mind. Consequently, it effectively resolves the issue of my limited visual imagination and improving it continually.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/AbstProcDo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have an idea of what I will configure; maximum of two windows per frame, and if is my portrait frame split horizontally and split vertically for my landscape frame, plus some additional config for Magit. Before I take the plunge, I wanted to quickly reach out to see what other people have done for their configs to get some ideas. Figure might also be good to collect a few different configurations of window configs for people interested.\n Some configs I have found on the way and will update with any suggestions people have:\n *Edit - I will add some more here as I find them/people suggest them\n  \nKarthink's config, good integration with the popper package\n emacs-pure - has some display-buffer-alist settings for magit which are of interest to me, as the built in magit methods for handling new frames isn't exactly what I want.\n Sacha's config using set-window-configuration and current-window-configuration more than display-buffer-alist. The Ediff settings stick out to me\n burly.el by u/alphapapa - might be an easier way to approach the current-window-configuration/set-window-configuration that Sacha has implemented\n Prot's window config - A lot of custom functions to help tailor the window management experience to his liking. \n eyebrowse - package to make Emacs be like i3. Example config from Karl Voit and the use of eyebrowse-restore to help make the configurations stick around.\n  \n​\n Any recommendations, please feel free to share them.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/egstatsml  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, like all software, the julia language server has a few quirks that need to be worked around. Long story short, I have two folders (not nested or anything):\n  \nfolder1 - A git repository of a large julia project that I cloned. Starting eglot here only works partially. Anything imported from other packages is a missing reference.\n \nfolder2 - A folder I created with various scripts that I wrote for the project in folder1. It contains a Project.toml detailing the necessary julia environment for those scripts to work. Starting eglot here works flawlessly. Both functions defined in folder1 as well as the other packages folder1 relies upon are referenced correctly.\n \n Is there a way for me to start eglot in folder2 but have it work as if I have started it in folder1? \n I believe one potential solution might be to tell Project.el that the git repository in folder1 belongs to the project in folder2, but I couldn't find a command for doing so.\n Alternatively, can I tell eglot in folder1 to connect to the language server that was started by eglot in folder2?\n edit: Hope the question makes sense, and apologies if not everything is phrased in the correct language.

After searching for some packages, I found none that really suited me.\n So I decided to write my own: https://github.com/pedroangelo/theme-rotation.el\n Check it out and tell me what you guys think. I've also included a sort of related work section in the README that discusses similar packages, and why I didn't found them to my taste. \n PS: I wrote this package for my personal use. But if more people find it useful, I'd be quite satisfied with myself.\n Also, do you think I should work towards getting it published in MELPA?

          "description": "While a for-loop is a straightforward construct in other programming languages, the loop macro, despite its power, can present challenges due to its intricacy. I find myself frustrated by its complexity.\n However, its conceptual abstractions are intriguing. Take, for example, the following code snippet:\n (loop for i below 10 sum i) \n The utilization of the term \"below\" in this context is particularly striking. Contrastingly, in languages like JavaScript, I typically read \"i < 10\" as \"i less than 10,\" pronouncing the two words \"less than\" in order to read the \"<\" symbol.\n The act of reading \"<\" as \"less than\" momentarily interrupts my cognitive flow between the two words. The loop macro condenses it as a single word, \"below,\" allowing me to pronounce \"i < 10\" more succinctly and smoothly, without interruption. Another viable alternative could be \"under.\"\n Moreover, the expression `1 < i < 10` can be read as \"from 1 to 10.\"\n (loop for i from 1 to 10 sum i) \n It enhance code readability mentally and streamline cognitive processing. \n    submitted by    /u/AbstProcDo  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's Emacs, so I'm sure it can, but what would be the most elegant approach to this?\n    submitted by    /u/amiralul  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello to all,\n I recently stumbled upon the setopt function introduced in emacs 29.\n  \ndefmacro setopt (&rest pairs)\n Set VARIABLE/VALUE pairs, and return the final VALUE. This is like 'setq', but is meant for user options instead of plain variables. This means that 'setopt' will execute any 'custom-set' form associated with VARIABLE.\n  \nSo basically it looks like a customize-set-variable but shorter. Indeed, both are defined almost next to each other, with most of the interesting bits duplicated.\n After reading its source code, I have the impression that its only major difference with customize-set-variable (besides the fact that customize-set-variable is also a user command) is related to user theme.\n I am not sure about the impact of using one over the user, do you guys have an opinion about this ?

          "description": "Ok, I'm quite new to Emacs and have a hard time fighting the learning curve. I'm using Spacemacs now because documentation is good, although stability is abysmal. But I kind of managed to configure it to an extent.\n Here's a problem. I need a tool that does basically this: I type a search phrase (name) and it shows every entry in an org file that contains this name, and if there's no entry with this name (i.e. heading with this name), automatically creates it.\n So it's basically deft, but deft works on multiple files which I find extremely inconvenient. I read the docs, but found no way to configure it to work on a single file.\n I believe it is possible to do with a simple org-capture using a custom function that checks if there is a heading in an org file and creates it if there is not. But elisp is high above my knowledge level right now and I don't want to invent the bicycle given how simple my problem is.\n I am extremely overwhelmed with options, but I think there must be some simple way to do this that does not require writing some custom code and (preferably) installing more plugins than I already have.\n    submitted by    /u/chesheersmile  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Rene's Sublimeless Zettelkasten for a few years, building up a note archive that uses datetime ID links. I think The Archive follows the same convention.\nFor example, if I create a note called \"Test note\" now, the text file will have the name 202310191918 Test note.md, and the link inside the software will look like this: [[202310191918]] Test note.\nIt would be interesting to try an alternative app/software at some point. I've looked around quite a bit, and I'm surprised about how few there are who supports this link ID syntax. Most software like Obsidian, Roam, and the like, uses the \"[[full title inside the brackets]]\" style, making them unable to parse my note link syntax. Some allows for choosing slightly different ID types, but usually never this specific one which I thought was one of the simpler ones.\nFor example, clicking the \"test note\" link in Obsidian would just result in the software creating a blank note called 202310191918.md. The only software I'm aware of can parses the datetime link ID type, are these two:\n1Writer for iOS mobile phone\nThe Archive for MacOS\nI haven't found anything that supports the datetime link ID for neither Android nor Windows. Are any of you aware of any software I've missed that can be used? All platforms are interesting, from iOS/Android to Windows/Linux/Mac. I'm aware it's a possibility to edit all of my notes using a Python script or similar to make them compatible, but that would break compatibility with the software I use today. Happy for any tips.

          "description": "This is my attempt to account for primary sources on Luhmann's zettelkasten, not secondary resources. Have I overlooked anything? I would appreciate any additional insights.\nThe slip box itself implicitly contains the techniques of work. However, extracting and analyzing these techniques is not an easy task.\nInside of Luhmann's Zettelkasten there is a series of entries on the principles of note-taking.\nLuhmann's system theory has many parallels with his understanding of Zettelkästen, as the slip box is also a system.\nThe article “Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen. Öffentliche Meinung und Sozialer Wandel.” Here, Luhmann openly shares his thoughts on the nuances of the system.\nLuhmann's insightful interview with Dirk Baecker and Georg Stanitzek in the book “Niklas Luhmann. Archimedes und wir Interviews” delves into his writing practices.\nAnother interview that delves into Luhmann's working style is his conversation with Wolfgang Hagen in “Warum haben Sie keinen Fernseher, Herr Luhmann? Letzte Gespräche mit Niklas Luhmann.”\nThere's a three-minute segment in the documentary “Niklas Luhmann - Beobachter im Krähennest” where Luhmann showcases his system.\nThere are almost certainly scattered memories of Luhmann's students and colleagues. He told many people about his Zettelkästen.",
