But QualifiedDo let's you use do-notation to build non-Monads. So let's say I make a module that looks like this\n module SetDo where import Data.Set (Set) import qualified Data.Set as Set fmap :: Ord b => (a -> b) -> Set a -> Set b fmap = Set.map return = Set.singleton ma >>= mf = Set.unions $ Set.map mf ma \n And this makes everything work! Very cool, QualifiedDo doing QualifiedDo things. However, it's clear that foo doesn't require the full power of a monad. ApplicativeDo, here we come. Turn it on, implement some bindings\n pure = Set.singleton ma <*> mb = ma >>= \\f -> Set.map f mb \n and....bummer\n • Could not deduce (Ord (Baz -> Foo)) arising from a do statement (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?) \n which unfortunately makes total sense. ApplicativeDo desugars into\n foos = (\\bar baz -> mkFoo bar baz) <$> bars <*> bazs \n which is trying to use fmap to make an intermediate Set (Baz -> Foo). However, I cannot see a theoretical reason this could not desugar into this instead\n foos = liftA2 mkFoo bars bazs \n given a binding\n liftA2 :: Ord c=> (a -> b -> c) -> Set a -> Set b -> Set c liftA2 f as bs = Set.map (uncurry f) (Set.cartesianProduct as bs) \n So it seems like what I want to do is not unsound, but is not possible given how ApplicativeDo works.

Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.\n I've written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I'm trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I'm running into difficulty - as I'm making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I'm working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -> Int function but not an Int -> IO Int.\n Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn't great and it's unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of 'dirty' using unsafePerformIO, but I can't immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.\n Thanks very much for any help.\n Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs\n    submitted by    /u/HHHQuestions  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the official wiki I found https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ which looks like an incredible piece of software engineering and I immediately watched their 25 minute video of demonstration and quite fell in love with it. BUT I am worried that using this would take away a lot of classical Haskell, because to me it seems a lot like Django or similar frameworks. With their different custom syntax operators like |> I feel like I’d be more learning their framework than actually Haskell. Is that a legitimate concern? My main goal is not to build a wonderful web app that makes me $$$ but just to build something with Haskell that is useful and that I can extend over time. \n Would a more lightweight framework be more appropriate and if so which? Is my impression of it not being really haskelly wrong? It feels like a lot of what makes haskell awesome has been abstracted away for ease of usage which is great for production but probably not for learning. \n I hope my question is clear and you can understand my concern.

          "description": "I was playing around with fancy record libaries and was very impressed with how well labels can infer types. Probably because it avoids unnecessary complexity and less-frequently-used operations.\n So I wanted to try how much unnecessary complexity and infrequently operations I could throw on top of it while maintaining reasonable type inference. Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.\n union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) => a -> b -> c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: (\"foo\" := String, \"bi\" := String, \"bar\" := Int, \"baz\" := Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: (\"foo\" := String, \"bi\" := String, \"bar\" := Int, \"baz\" := Double) \n The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:\n type family Concat l r where Concat '[] a = a Concat (x ': xs) a = x ': Concat xs a \n I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:\n l :: Proxy '[1,2] l = Proxy r :: Proxy '[3,4] r = Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c => Proxy a -> Proxy b -> Proxy c cat _ _ = Proxy c1 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c1 = cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy '[3,4] c2 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c2 = cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy '[1,2] c3 = cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] \n And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1\n You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks.

Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it's variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). \n I'm interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to \"desugar\" syntax into it's core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I've considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I'm looking for. However I can see it's been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.\n Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I'm interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it's interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.\n I'm aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated.

How exactly would I make the example code work?\n I'd eventually like to see this work on the Emacs babel side, but I won't get greedy yet. Emacs babel is just a wrapper apparently for feeding multiple lines into a non-project global REPL, i.e., fraught.\n A really good tutorial on this would be nice to find, BTW. Most of what I've seen is just someone's stream-of-consciousness hypnosis ramblings, i.e., leaving a beginner to do guess-and-test over and over. And beginner books don't talk about it either; rather, you simply put code in a file and load it at the REPL as you work through these books.

Is this a good understanding of the situation?\n Similarly, in Petnar's representations of algebraic effects (e.g.), it's quite important that the handlers have access to the computation's continuation, and get to decide how it's used. I haven't been able to find any support for this in Polysemey, but everything's phrased so differently it's difficult to search. \n Any suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and practice, or for quickly getting up to speed on the last twenty years of research in this area?\n    submitted by    /u/ShapeOfMatter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have documented it with more detail in the changelog entry. The most interesting one is making Fake type as a transformer which allows writing efficient code more easily. This was done by Isaac Van Bakel and more details are here: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata#using-the-faket-transformer\n The current release also adds various new modules (+ 15), locale improvements and contains updates to fake data sources. Also, the test suite has been enhanced which helped me find bugs in the upstream Ruby data sources (Corresponding fix: https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/pull/2339) . And thanks to Tristan de Cacqueray for fixing the test failure issues related to random 1.2.0 as part of ZuriHac.\n The following packages can be used to create generators out of fakedata:\n * quickcheck integration by Jappie Klooster: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata-quickcheck\n * hedgehog integration by Matt Parsons: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hedgehog-fakedata\n    submitted by    /u/sibip  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's because I posted about a vacancy we had back in October. Since then, we've hired two new developers, but we're still expanding!\n Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net\n Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.\n We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You'd get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.\n More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).\n We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.\n One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job.

So for example, I started with a function for working with indices and counts of elements.\n ```\n indicesRemaining :: Cnt -> Idx -> [Idx]\n indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implentation>\n ```\n and say I've renamed the types to be clearer, using a global find-replace:\n ```\n indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]\n indicesRemaining cnt idx = <some-implementation>\n ```\n this is great, but I'd like to also update cnt and idx, to be blkCnt and blkIdx, for example. I can do in manually, but I've done a load of refactorings, so have a load of these.\n What I am looking for is a tool that can run over my code-base, and spurt out a list of types, and all the different variables names used by that type. So, if I have the following code:\n ``` indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> [BlockIdx]\n indicesRemaining blkCnt blkIdx = <some-implementation>\n indexWithinCnt :: BlockCnt -> BlockIdx -> Bool\n indexWithinCnt cntMax idx = <some-implementation>\n ```\n Then, I am looking for something like the following output:\n ``` BlockCnt : blkCnt, cntMax\n BlockIdx : blkIdx, idx\n ```\n And I can then go through and manually review cases where lots of different names exist for the same thing.\n Is anyone aware whether something like this already exists?

So I've been job hunting for Haskell positions. \n Naturally, I got rejected from most of the applications. I'm expecting to get rejected in all, tbh. Getting rejected doesn't bother me though since I'm pretty new to Haskell anyway. This is pretty much the only expected outcome.\n Anyway, I'm more concerned with how I can get my first step through an internship. It (internship) appears to be non-existent in the Haskell industry, which it makes it difficult to get some really good hands-on training with the proper learning environment. So with that, it seems like internship is pretty much impossible. I noticed a common expectation among the rejection messages that I'm expected to have more experience with the language. But getting this experience is rather difficult, and I don't really see a clear path to obtain a decent enough experience with it.\n I'm wondering: \n  \nDo personal projects hold any weight in the deliberation process?\n Is contributing to Haskell OSS the only/better way for people to validate that I know something?\n Do I just work for free?\n How do I know what I'm doing isn't a bad approach without anyone there to program with or to act as a mentor? I'm pretty much alone in self-learning. I tried streaming but it's sometimes very distracting, and really daunting.\n  \nThis post isn't meant to gather pity from others, please don't pity me!

Most of the operations have a complexity of O(log n), but since the logarithms are base 16, that behaves more like O(1) in most cases.\n For more information, see the documentation on Hackage.

          "description": "Good day everyone!\n I've always been using scalamock with scalatest only, but now I'd like to optimize my tests by rewriting long running sequential scalatest suites to uTest. I'm using default scalatest MockFactory for my suite. I know that it's supposed to work with scalatest only and I've seen in scalamock guide that you can implement your own MockFactoryBase and it should somehow work, but I didn't really work for me(maybe I just understood guid wrong). \n I create separate instance of the mock in every test context\n test(\"blah blah\") {val myMock = mock[TraitToMock] ...}\n Also my project is written using cats-effect, so I'm running tests also with it's IO \n And in process I faced multiple issues such as:\n java.util.ConcurrentModificationException: mutation occurred during iteration\n It seems it's because in UnorderedHandler(which is used in my tests) handle method they're using synchronization, but in parent Handler class operations with handlers are not synchronized.\n https://preview.redd.it/7sflfd9ud0a71.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=8eae336304b348946886066c1214c950229c0b71\n https://preview.redd.it/0nglptufe0a71.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=0db3228a4f760d921e495a122ef8c6350364d995\n Wrapping this methods in synchronization helps and tests don't fail. But it seems like this fix is not the best solution.\n If I'm not getting exception listed above, I get like intersection of mock contexts, mocks handle each other expectations. Something like that\n https://preview.redd.it/8wsgaq0ai0a71.png?width=3426&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b8b9df369e699b5aac7679518fab8cd3b2cc36\n So maybe someone knows how to make scalamock work with utest properly?

For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.\n Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.\n I don't have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.\n Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?\n My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. \n Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 \n tagging /u/makingthematrix \n Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.\n ​\n Thanks a tonne\n    submitted by    /u/ivanvelikanov  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or simply - what would you recommend?\n From what I've explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.\n How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?\n In a similar vein, what's your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).\n I'm also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I've read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.\n Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3?

As I get started I am reminded why I f**king hate TypeScript/JavaScript so much. I'd say between not being that good at FE to begin with and having to manage dumb error messages I am losing velocity. I'd love to develop this in Scala.JS and Laminar as it’s so much simpler and I already know Scala fairly well, but I am worried that if when the MVP needs to scale and onboard new developers I will have trouble finding any. Should I just suck it up and use React?

Calling get[T] should only compile if the tuple contains the type T. \n Perhaps \"type map\" is not the canonical name for this.

The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.\n Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? \n If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity's rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/EthelMerman  \n [link]   [comments]",

It also supports runtime constraints.\n Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean \"without macro/black magic\"). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.\n Usage\n Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: ==>[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.\n Example: ```scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*\n inline def log(x: Double ==> Greater[0d]): Double = Math.log(x) ```\n Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: ```\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't think it makes sense to register this app on F-Droid or, gods have mercy, Google Play Store. In the future, I will do it with a more complex app I have in plans, but for now, `adb install` is the way to go). Or you can copy the whole repo and build the app yourselves.\n Here's how it looks like:\n Scala 3 Calculator\n This remarkable achievement of razor-edge tech and top-notch UX wouldn't be possible without all the brilliant people working on Scala 3, GraalVM, Gluon, JavaFX, and scala-maven-plugin. Me, I'm just putting the puzzles together.\n That being said, Scala 3 support still needs some love. There are issues, mostly around JVM/Scala compatibility (Java modules *coff* *coff*) . Now I will spend some time describing what I found about them the best I could - and nagging the above-mentioned brilliant people to take a look. But, all in all, I think we're really doing great. I didn't expect the migration to be so easy. Just as earlier I didn't expect all these different pieces would so easily fall into their places and a Scala app on Android would just work.

I'm mostly a Java guy, but with the new functional bits in Java I found Scala people many times have already developed good practices for things we are still struggling with, so I'm asking here.\n Recently there is a trend in my workplace to replace null-friendly values with Optional, so (simplified case, you get the idea)\n NamedObject obj = ..... if(obj == null){ return \"no object, so no name\" } else { return obj.name(); } \n becomes\n Optiona<NamedObject> opt = .... return opt.map(NamedObject::name).orElse(\"no object, so no name\") \n I like that, but I don't know how to handle logging. When I have\n NamedObject obj = ..... if(obj == null){ logger.warn(\"there was no object\") return \"no object, so no name\" } else { logger.debug(\"using actual name of the object\") return obj.name(); } \n What would be the proper way to keep the logging functionality in a more functional way?\n    submitted by    /u/pgris  \n [link]   [comments]",

This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:\n ``` * Section one\n +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-one () \"This is not a useful function.\")\n +end_src\n  \nSection two\n  \n+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-two () \"This is not a useful function, either.\")\n +end_src\n ```\n When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.\n Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I'm describing?

          "description": "I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.\n Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can't say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.\n Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don't understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it. Maybe I \"solved\" a side-effect of another problem instead?\n Can anybody give me a bit of insight that will either give me confidence in my solution or help me find the real problem?\n    submitted by    /u/WitnessTheBadger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Org has the built-in org-sort command, but it must be run manually, and it only supports one sorting method at a time. It quickly becomes tedious, and it's impractical to use regularly.\n But with a bit of code and an after-save-hook, this can be automated so that, every time I save the file, all of its entries are re-sorted according to my criteria (alphabetical, priority, and to-do status), and then the point is repositioned to where it was before the file was sorted (the last feature being one I just added, which makes it much mo…",

I'm determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.\n I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I'm not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).\n I'm just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type \"darwin\"). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.\n ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (> (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-11\")) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-14\"))) \n Then, it occurred to me that I'm not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?\n In the meantime, I'm off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won't need to ask for this kind of help in the future.

I've written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I'm okay, but I'm not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.\n What I'd like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn't depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn't come with a REPL.\n I'm currently use Octave in a literate mode and it's pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure's case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.\n Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/\n The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like\n clj -Sdeps \"{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \\\"0.11.935\\\"}}}\" \n Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.\n I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el\n It seems relatively straightforward - but I'm unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I'm okay if this only works on Linux)\n Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know.

          "description": "My personal keybindings, installed at Emacs start-up as a global minor mode, are numerous and a disorganized mess. That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. \n I'm aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. \n I'm also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don't know why it's so disliked. It's essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can't go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.\n An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. \n Am I overlooking any packages? I'm facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I've never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is. Kudos to the Spacemacs folks, who have won so many converts to Emacs just as Magit and Org have. \n I put my fate into the hands of r/emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/tdavey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.\n It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.\n The 'just as if...' is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don't happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.\n Even if it didn't, I'm not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).\n I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?\n How might I do this? Any ideas would be great.

I'm still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. \n I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. \n The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. \n The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.\n It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I've kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. \n I'm curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? \n Thanks, \n -Hunter\n    submitted by    /u/EMWaveHunter  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you did, what worked for you and what didn't? \n As always, thank you very much for your time, attention and knowledge sharing... :)\n PD: edited to make it clearer what \"chording\" means in this question.

But the second command key, the C-f, couldn't be entered. Emacs stopped at C-x and refused to accept another command key. \n I closed Emacs down and restarted, and entered C-x C-f to access a file, and again, the C-f wouldn't register. It's not a problem with my keyboard: the f key works fine (see this post?) and the only changes to my .emacs file have been some minor font changes for font-lock-mode. \n It seems to involve only C-f. Other sequences do work: C-x C-b for example, or C-x C-s. But C-x C-f is a sequence I use a lot, and I have no idea why it's not working. Any ideas?

          "description": "I'd like to hear about the layouts you've selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.\n Background, for normal, sane people who don't know what I'm talking about:\n One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.\n These keyboards make heavy use of 'layers' - additional custom 'modifier' keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..\n For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as \"home row modifiers\". Typically you'd make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.\n But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I'm interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they've settled on.\n I'm playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a 'game' in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I'm thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.\n    submitted by    /u/Private_Frazer  \n [link]   [comments]",

In most of my dns zone files the TAB key acts as I want, ie when you press TAB the cursor moves 8 characters to the right, (from position 1) when you move the marker with arrow left it jumps back to position 1, and if you press TAB again it jumps 8 characters to the right again.\n But in some files when I press TAB the marker moves to something like position 16. Now when you press arrow left the marker goes to the left as if the space is filled with spaces. If you try to press TAB again nothing happens.\n I've been trying to read the documentation on how to program the TAB key but I haven't been able to solve the problem.\n    submitted by    /u/dreamfin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn't manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I'm currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window.

It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil's jump list, but works more generically.\n Why?\n Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I’m getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim’s jump list which, in Evil’s implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn’t work when you’re not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I'd share.\n Does anyone do anything similar?

          "description": "Hello! I just started using Emacs and have a noob question:\n How to configure Emacs to automatically close brackets like in VS code or other text editors?\n I switched from Vim to the latest version of Doom Emacs and didn't like the behavior of auto-closing brackets. Specifically, I don't like two things:\n - Auto erasing closing bracket('|' -> cursor):\n ```c++ int main() { {| } ``` becomes: ```c++ int main() { | ``` \n  \nNo new line with indentation after pressing Shift+Enter:\n c++ int main() { { |} } \n Just Enter:\n c++ int main() { { | } } \n \n I tried several solutions from the internet, but neither of them worked as I wanted(I also tried hacking on them, but it was really hard because I am a noob in Elisp and Emacs). My requirements are not that high, though: - Add a closing bracket - Add new line and indent after I press Enter (and Shift+Enter) - Don't remove the closing bracket when I erase the opening one (I usually start erasing from the closing bracket and when I reach opening one, it removes the next closing bracket)\n In vim, I used simple bindings:\n ``` \" brackets\n inoremap \" \"\"<left> inoremap ' ''<left> inoremap ( ()<left> inoremap [ []<left> inoremap { {}<left> inoremap {<CR> {<CR>}<ESC>O inoremap {;<CR> {<CR>};<ESC>O \n ```\n I tried to implement it in Emacs but couldn't. Will appreciate some help.\n Is there a good way for auto closing brackets in Emacs?\n EDIT: I think electric pair suits me. As for me, smartparens' behavior is really annoying: it deletes closing pair and acts strange. I figured out how to turn off it in Doom Emacs: lisp (remove-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook #'smartparens-global-mode) (smartparens-global-mode -1) \n One thing left: I want auto indentation after pressing Shift+Enter too.\n    submitted by    /u/MisterMoral  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm using lsp, so flycheck defaults to using lsp as it's checker. But I want to use flake8 as the default checker, which depends on the virtual environment to be loaded before. The environment is automatically loaded using direnv. I tried this to select flake8 as default:\n (add-hook 'pyhon-mode-local-vars-hook (lambda () (when (flycheck-may-enable-checker 'python-flake8) (flycheck-select-checker 'python-flake8)))) \n However it doesn't select the checker and I have to do it manually (M-x flycheck-select-checker). I also tried disabling the lsp checker completely and to always select flake8 (without checking if it can be enabled) but it still doesn't work.

There is an official test file, but that one is far from code coverage and I had since tried to find the best way to create my own files. These are some examples (ignore .bin files).\n I tried to use hexdump and some other GUI tool which were not very useful imo. The best luck I had was with a custom c++ code but the issue I had was that code is since broken, besides its not the best idea to rewrite source .txt and forget to update the .bin. Which led me to writing my own elisp file editor.\n A binary file would look like this:\n 0a 00 00 01 00 00 11 00 ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | end of vector | | byte data | following data will be a byte vector // Those 00 00 are lengths of names of vector and byte // but i removed the names to make it fit on the line // More details in the NBT specs. \n The above would be diplayed like this:\n 0a 0000 01 0000 11 00 \n Or like this: ([%] means vector, b means byte)\n [%] \"\" { b \"\" 0x11 } \n Or:\n [%] \"\" { b \"\" 17 } \n So it should be at least hexadecimal, indented and separated into lines, but I would also add some readability.\n Optional: While editing the file I would like to safeguard myself and do checks on the data that I insert.

          "description": "Hello, I'm a long time Vim user who switched to (DOOM)Emacs yesterday and I am looking for a way to translate all of my UltiSnips LaTeX snippets to yasnippet. So far I figured out how make basic snippets which can be expanded by pressing TAB and snippets which expand only in certain environments like the math environment but I can't figure out how to translate my more complicated snippets which expand automatically. Here is an UltiSnips example:\n snippet / \"Fraction\" i\n \\\\frac{${VISUAL}}{$1}$0\n endsnippet\n What this one does is the following: If type 1/ it will automatically expand to \\frac{1}{} . Another example is the ket:\n priority 100\n context \"math()\"\n snippet \"\\|(.*?)\\>\" \"ket\" riA\n \\ket{\\!p[snip.rv=match.group](https://snip.rv=match.group)(1)\\}\\``\n endsnippet\n This gives me \\ket{a} when I type |a> . I'm sure there must be a way to write snippets like these in yasnippet but I haven't found any examples of such snippets.\n    submitted by    /u/doomenguin  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far I have found three options:\n  \nAssociate all the processes with the log buffer (as the process buffer). This is discouraged in the manual and indeed seems like a bad idea (it may interleave the outputs).\n \nCreate a unique process buffer for each process and copy the output from the process buffer to the log buffer at the end in the process sentinel. The problem is that we may have lots of buffers left. It seems to work if we kill the buffer as well in the sentinel, but I am not sure if that works reliably.

Clearing previous output is not an option, because I want to refer to it occasionally.\n But I can't seem to find anything in eshell that corresponds to this feature, and it doesn't use comint either, so any help would be great.

However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. \n Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like \"adaptive-wrap\" does for ordinary org mode files?)\n Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I'd like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).\n (1) Since the todo's are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the \"todo\" keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?\n (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?\n    submitted by    /u/the88doctor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have an issue where my .dir-locals are getting bigger and bigger, namely due to my current projects using prettier in quite a few different major modes. But also due to specific eglot setups. Enabling prettier and eglot for the relevant major-mode would work in these projects, but would start becoming annoying in the others.\n In trying to move most of the logic to my Emacs configuration and have less duplicates in each of my project roots, I tried the following:\n ;; path/to/my/project/.dir-locals.el ((nil . ((me/eglot-p . t) (me/prettier-p . t)))) ;; dotemacs.el (use-package prettier :preface (defvar-local me/prettier-p nil \"Should prettier be enabled?\") :hook (web-mode . me/prettier-mode-maybe) :config (put 'me/prettier-p 'safe-local-variable #'booleanp)) (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () \"Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally.\" (when me/prettier-p (prettier-mode))) \n The issue with that is that dir-local variables are taken into account after web-mode-hook has kicked in, even with nil when no major-mode is specified. So me/prettier-p is always nil in me/prettier-mode-maybe.\n A second attempt, ignoring dir-local variables altogether, looked like this:\n (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () \"Enable `prettier-mode' when the prettier executable is found locally.\" (when-let ((command (shell-command-to-string \"npm list -p prettier\")) (prettier-p (length> (string-trim-right command) 0))) (prettier-mode))) \n Which is obviously too slow to be acceptable.\n What are your preferred methods to avoid having to copy the same .dir-locals.el every time you start a similar project or even reinstall your machine(s)? That was actually my case btw: I realized while reinstalling my machine how much stuff I had to copy around after cloning all my repositories.\n    submitted by    /u/TheFrenchPoulp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm an IDE user (JetBrains currently, Visual Studio when I used to write C#) with basic Vim knowledge, using primarily Java and JS with some TS. I'm getting tired of the less-than-useful vim support in the IDE space, as well as general inflexibility in setting up workflows. I've been looking into emacs (spacemacs) as a daily-driver, and I like almost everything about it. However, I'm not sure what I'll do with a certain part of my workflow that relies on refactoring support.\n This applies less to new features, and more to maintenance work on legacy(ish) code, which is honestly a lot of what I do. I've come to heavily rely on Kent Beck's \"make the hard change easy\" advice, combined with Arlo Belshee's read by refactoring. I like that I can use chains of known-safe IDE refactorings to rapidly explore and change the structure of a body of code before I even understand what it's doing, and know that I'm not changing the semantics in the process.\n Seems like a decent portion of my go-to tools are supported in JS with js2-refactor, but not all. (Haven't looked at whether it works with TS yet, and Tide may also be able to fill some holes even when applied to plain-JS.) On the other hand meghanada has been a bit disappointing in the refactoring department. Rust, if I ever work with that, looks to have an absolutely phenomenal language server.\n In addition to my two primaries, I'd like to be confident in branching out into, say, Go, Kotlin, or Swift, and I see about as much refactoring support for each of those as what meghanada has for Java; that is, nearly nothing.\n What do experienced emacs-ians do for these tasks? Do former IDE users among you not miss automated refactorings? Do you have emacs-native workflows that reliably work for, say, \"extract/inline variable/function/parameter\"?\n    submitted by    /u/better_work  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got two projects. \n f:\\project-base\n f:\\project-base\\specific-case\n I cannot change the layout of these projects; they're not under my control.\n It's legitimate to want to compile project-base on its own. However, most of the time I want to compile specific-case.\n Both project-base and specific-case have .dir-locals.el files, and I'm using the files to define relative paths to tools and the like. I've defined an override variable that I can set within a hydra called project--path-override. However, if I invoke my hydra while visiting a buffer that's in project-base, it uses the .dir-locals.el from that directory. That's kind of as I expect, but if my override is set, I'd like to figure out a way to use the locals from the override directory.\n Even if I invoke the hydra and set the default-directory to the project--path-override and call (hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer), the local variables from project-base are still set.\n I don't really want to have to defvar all of these configuration variables somewhere and update them every time I switch project directories; being free of that management is exactly why I'm using .dir-locals.el in the first place. \n I also thought that I might be able to create a fake buffer as part of invoking the hydra, but that seems like a needless mess of its own. \n Anyone have a more manageable solution? I can always switch back to a file in specific-case, but I often forget to do that and launch a compile in the wrong directory first. Plus, I'm doing most of my work in project-base, so I end up having to visit random files that I actually don't care about in specific-case just to get the vars to be set right. (I could also modify the .dir-locals.el in project-base to match the one in specific-case, but this falls apart if I ever try to do anything in specific-case2.)\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

To that effect, I've been using auto-fill-mode to insert newlines as appropriate, and then manually putting backslash characters at the end of each broken lines.

          "description": "dyncloze is an emacs module (offered via Melpa) for testing yourself on language learning. The core idea is that you can take any piece of text in emacs, and form \"clozes\" (an Anki terminology), that erase the work in question and let you guess what it should be. For example, you can test, in English \"in\" vs. \"on\", and every location of those words will be replaced by a cloze, denoted by \"[ ]\" and you are led through each of them and asked to guess each one. At the end, it tells you how well you did.\n In version 0.1, we started with the ability just to test two or more words against each other. With this version, 0.2 (just submitted, not yet updated on Melpa), we add the ability to use regex's for testing. That opens the ability to do more useful testing, at least with European languages that have a lot of word variants and word-ending grammatical bits.\n I've added two example files, one for Spanish, one for Portuguese to demonstrate. You can load them up and try out functions such as dyncloze-es-ser-estar, which will let you guess every variant of ser and estar (\"eras\", \"fui\", \"está\", \"estaba\", etc.), but you just choose which of the verbs it belongs to: ser or estar.

          "description": "Hello! I present to you my first emacs package - atp. It's intended as a component for writing text editing commands and augmenting modal editing modes. Its main feature is the ability to automatically recognize and highlight things at point and apply commands to highlighted things or active region.\n I started working on this package because I was lookig for a new approach that would help me save a couple of keystrokes on each common task such as copying and pasting text, evaluation of lisp expressions and shell-commands, changing letter case, etc.\n For a year I used a wonderful package \"expand-region\" for that purpose. Despite it being very smart and useful, it requires 2 actions to select an object under the point. First, the user must navigate to the desired location, and then call er/expand-region to select an object. I thought that the second step was redundant and decided to write a package that will work without it.\n At this moment atp is unstable because it was written in a hurry and my knowledge of elisp and emacs internals isn't great. I just wanted to write something usable as soon as I could to check the viability of the chosen approach. Here is a repo and a video that demonstrates how atp works in the context of a tiny modal editing mode.\n https://github.com/tre-flip/atp\n http://ctrl-c.club/~treflip/atp.mp4\n What do you think about it?\n    submitted by    /u/KnightOfTribulus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Reading Christian Tietze's and Sascha Fast's blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.\nI figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain's presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.\nI decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.\nFrom looking at his setup, I'd have to track the following:\nTotal from a year\nTotal from the first to the fourth quarters\nMonthly average\nWeekly average\nNumber of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it\nDaily average\nNumber of days in which I get my daily average or above it\nHe tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.\nMy problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn't talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?\nReally appreciate any help you can give me.",

Greetings!\nI have kept a paper zettelkasten for the past six months or so, which has benefitted from everyone's discourse and guidance here. So, thank you all! I hope to contribute a meager offering now and then to this already robust discussion forum.\nRelated to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.\nThe subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It's true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that's probably why I chose a paper system.\nI also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I'd like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.\nAnyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone's expertise!

I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.\nI did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  \"What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?\".\nI think that I understand, from what I've read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.\nThe basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" resonates with me.  I'm just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.

E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:\nSome description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].\n2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].\n3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].\n4. do b [citekey2].\n\nYou do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].\n\nI ask:\nIf I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?\nIn general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don't question what I do like in the scenario described?\nI appreciate your comments in advance.",

Hope to become as good as you soon.\nI have a couple of questions, however;\nI don't want to start with a digital zettelkasten, so I've started the process of acquiring a novelink box and index cards from Amazon. But info online is considerably vague. I know I'm to use my fleeting notes for quick ideas or notes as they come, then my literature note is for learning purposes before transferring to my permanent note, then finally transfer singular ideas into my zettels. My question is how do I use this while reading a book or taking an online course? What do I need to transfer between these notes? How do I know I'm taking the ideal note? Do I look at it from the context of why I'm studying the note/book/course, or I'm to maintain an open mind?\nAlso, I don't know if there are copywriters in this group, but how can I use this method to boost my research ability? How do you use your zettelkasten system to research?\nThanks for your answers!",

Halmos. and on page 134, he discusses how he organizes a book or long article:\n\n  \nAt one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it's mentioned.\n\n\nEmphasis mine.\nIt is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.",

For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn't seem to fit the Zettelkasten 'method' described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.\nThe first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…",
