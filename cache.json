ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... \n Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.\n Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/marullos_trahaniotis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I then proceeded to create an 'hello world' project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I'll go with the flow). \n The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I'm running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).\n Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn't notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?\n (edit: formatting)\n    submitted by    /u/JustADirtyLurker  \n [link]   [comments]",

I dunno if it's a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.\n What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)\n    submitted by    /u/_Chiyoku  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test `dependencies:`), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I'd like to test.\n I have tried to use `verbatim` in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along `build-tool-depends`:, which should allow me to reference a `project:executable`. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that `test-suite` in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a `Could not find module` in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the `executable` section `other-modules:`) when running `stack test`.\n I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with `build-tools:`. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.\n Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! \n Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)\n ==== QUOTE END ====\n Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn't in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.\n    submitted by    /u/Martinsos  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So i tried to write a program with a gui and decided to use gloss to render it. But when i try to import the module, Graphics.Gloss it says it's not found. So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:\n cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the \"-dev\" version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. \n So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn't find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages. This may not have to do with haskell but i assume i will get just as much help here as on r/NixOS \n I am glad for anyone taking their time to help me.\n    submitted by    /u/The_Ek_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. \n For example,\n  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] \n However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x <- [0..2] and y <- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. \n One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:\n  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] \n Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.\n The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables' references in a generator's body.\n For example, \n  [[x,y] | x <- [0..2], y <- [10*x..10*x+2]] \n We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.\n Question:\n Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables' references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?\n Thanks\n  \nEdit:\n Some one possibly misunderstand my question.\n For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?\n ``` [[x1] | x1 <- [0..2]]\n [[x1,x2] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2]]\n [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2]]\n [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 <- [0..2], x2 <- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 <- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 <- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]\n -- and so on ```\n It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way.

The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.\n  \n*) I don't pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.\n  \nWould this even be viable?

I work as a professional programmer and do Python all day long.\n I started the \"Learn you a Haskell\" book to tease my brain and learn to approach problems from a different angle. And I have learned a lot and I think my Python code has benefited from it.\n But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it's still in the back of my mind to get back to it.\n However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can't seem to find something useful to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.\n But I can't bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).\n So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I'm not sure whether it's even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that's not doable, a .so shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python's ctypes module (not sure if that is even possible either).\n Any ideas?

          "description": "Hey all. I'm a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. \n For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called \"composable functions\" (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.\n The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it's inputs change.\n Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.\n So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!\n This is a fascinating idea to me, and I'd love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).\n I know there's gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.\n Does anyone know of anyone who's attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?\n    submitted by    /u/sintrastes  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or at least a decent project template where I can focus on solving the tasks without fighting the tooling?\n EDIT: Searching for one brought up this thread, but one of them is down and I can't judge the quality of the other one in there.\n    submitted by    /u/Amarandus  \n [link]   [comments]",

That is to say, let the relation on records be induced by the subset relation on the sets of field labels.\n Example:\n data A = A {x, y: Int} data B = B {x, y, z: Int} \n Here, B has an extra field z, so we are justified in saying that A ≤ B.\n Now:\n  \nA function that takes A can also take B (and ignore all the extra fields).\n In other words, if f ∷ A → Y and b ∷ B, then f b ∷ Y is well-typed.\n \nA function that gives B can also give A (and forget all the extra fields).\n In other words, if f ∷ X → B and x ∷ X, then f x ∷ B is well-typed.\n \n This can currently be done by writing boring code, so having it as a feature would reduce the amount of boring code, which is good. In real life, records tend to be big, so the reduction is substantial.\n A dual construction can be offered for sum types: for example, a function that can take A + B can handle an A or a B as well.\n Is this less than ideal? What are the problems? In a dream world of infinite possibilities, where you can add subtyping to Haskell, how would you go about it?\n  \nI imagine there are some people here that know everything there is to know about type systems, some people that have no idea of what a type system with subtyping looks like (me — I only know C and Haskell), and many people somewhere in between.

To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren't applicable.\n My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.\n System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…",

My mentor tasked me to explore the basics of Scala for backend services so I'm here to ask for recommendations how one would build backend services as I've read around Scala doesn't depend as much on frameworks as Java does. \n I've read on some 'frameworks' for Scala such as Play and Http4s, but the resources on those are quite scarce, and I've tried Http4s but I can't get my head to wrap around dependency management using sbt.\n Are there any recommendations you would give me for learning?\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/BlueRey02  \n [link]   [comments]",

As long as I can run sbt publish from my terminal I'm happy\n Here is my code so far:\n ​\n build.sbt:\n scalaVersion := \"2.13.3\"\n name := \"hello-world\"\n organization := \"ch.epfl.scala\"\n version := \"1.0\"\n publishTo := Some(\"Hello-world app\" at \"<url>\")\n libraryDependencies += \"org.scala-lang.modules\" %% \"scala-parser-combinators\" % \"2.0.0\"\n ​\n plugins.sbt:\n addSbtPlugin(\"com.github.sbt\" % \"sbt-native-packager\" % \"1.9.4\")\n addSbtPlugin(\"se.marcuslonnberg\" % \"sbt-docker\" % \"1.8.2\")\n addSbtPlugin(\"com.eed3si9n\" % \"sbt-assembly\" % \"x.y.z\")\n    submitted by    /u/steingrim_  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my new Job, I am supposed to learn Scala and I already had a hard time understanding Generics and all such concepts. Additionally the functional way of Scala, stuff like accumulator based recursion and tail recursion, lazy variables also got my head spinning.\n I am planning to Dive even deeper into this but I wanted to know from all of you that should I rather go and learn Java or TypeScript in depth before going to Scala? Actually I don't have a lot of time grasping all of the concepts and so I began with basics of Scala and till now my experience is neither too good nor too bad.\n ​\n As of 2021 (or we can say almost 2022), what would be your advise for a beginer with statically typed language and how should I go about learning Scala so that I get a good grip in it?\n ​\n Additionally, when we say Java there are two things: 1. Pure Programming Side of Java, 2. JVM and of-course here I am not referring to the JVM side as I understand, since Scala anyways runs on JVM, that's a necessary thing. What I need to know is that do you need to go through Java Programming or any such language before getting Scala really well?\n    submitted by    /u/sedhha  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since my job has been related to data I have started getting a focus to machine learning. Of course I know python is epic but I also know scala can do this like python. I found out spark and smile are good libraries for big data and machine learning, but I couldn't find proper libraries for data visualization. Yeap. smile has good visualization libraries based on swing and vega lite. At this moment I wonder other scala programmers how to work and which library you like.

          "description": "This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I'm struggling a bit to figure it out. I'm trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I'm looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don't see how to get the actual contents of the file. I'm assuming it's stored as a Blob, but there aren't any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can't transmit them.\n So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I'm not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I'm assuming the problem isn't actually super complex, but I'm just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.\n Basically I'm looking for something File -> ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.\n Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn't stored in a DragEvent.\n Is there any easy way to do what I'm trying?\n    submitted by    /u/ablygo  \n [link]   [comments]",

In short: I'm not smart enough for Haskell, so I'm looking for other alternatives where immutability and pure functions are, if not mandatory, at least encouraged.\n In just a few days I hopped to Elm, Ocaml, back to Typescript and, finally, there and back again to Javascript(is programming-language hopping a thing?), after this book got me excited to give it a try. After reaching to chapter 8 with a certain hopelessness regarding (lack of) types, I ended up to this article with quite strong arguments against using JS if you want strong typing and functional proogramming facilities (\"Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two\"). The article mentioned PureScript and here I am. From Haskell syntax to strong typing, the language seems to have everything I'm looking for mentioned right at its home page.\n While learning Haskell, I liked pretty much almost everything. I really, really liked its syntax, the ways we can define types and type classes, its simplicity, and I think it was relatively easy to learn that. What got me really overburdened was how to \"change states\" and IO. From that point of view, is there something along the way that disapoint me?\n EDIT: this is being helpful: https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md\n    submitted by    /u/gooddevenv  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, \n I'm currently writing up my PhD thesis using org-mode, and it is a joy in comparison to my past experiences writing raw LaTeX. \n I'm simultaneously attempting to write up some of the thesis chapters in paper form for publication, and have been creating the papers by selectively #+INCLUDE -ing the thesis chapter .org files. I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. \n This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. \n Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ForsakenMachinery  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know that org-agenda can get pretty sluggish around a thousand files, but it's my understanding that org-ql is faster, although maybe not that faster. Any experience? Thanks!\n NOTE: this is not for TODOs but for general search, I've seen workarounds that exclude files not containing tasks nor projects from the search, but that's not what I'm interested in, I want to search every file and ideally using more structured queries like those of org-ql (vs deft).\n EDIT: I've been experimenting a bit with this:\n  \nI cloned this big nonsense ZK which is designed to stress-test note-taking apps.\n I converted all notes from md to org using pandoc: for f in *; do pandoc --to org \"$f\" > \"${f%%.md}.org\"; done. Not really necessary for what it follows, except for the file extension part, but anyway.\n Now, searching for some text with ripgrep is very fast, as expected, for example with 56/10000 matches:\n  \n```\n  \ntime rg -c \"to queer noises\" *.org | wc -l 56\n  \nreal 0m0.317s user 0m0.195s sys 0m0.316s ```\n  \nNow with org-ql the same search setting org-directory to be the ZK folder, requiring no grouping and just random order, and doing a (regexp \"to queer noises\") freezes, at least I've been waiting for minutes now for it to end. Repeating the search in a subset of that ZK with just a few hundred notes, it ends after some seconds, but it's still borderline usable.\n  \nSo I guess the answer is a sound NO, org-ql can't be reasonably used in a setup like this one. u/github-alphapapa do you have any objection to my methodology here? Thanks!\n EDIT: deft has also been terribly sluggish with this same ZK, both in generating the deft buffer and in searching through it, so the best option seems to be something like consult-ripgrep.\n    submitted by    /u/nnenneplex  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.\n The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.\n What I currently do: I enter \"wo C-j not C-j do <Enter>\", which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.\n What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering \"todo\" first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with \"work\". However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn't do that.\n So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?\n Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.\n I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for \"notes\", find nothing, then add a space and \"work\" and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order. It feels like that is what the helm project page advertises anyway, but it just doesn't happen when I try it.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/BettaGeorge  \n [link]   [comments]",

What usually works is looking in recently accessed files, be it recentf or just searching mini-buffer history.\n Finding file in a project usually works the best (Projectile), but it would probably work even better if it could just search the entire system.\n If I'm certain I have had this file open this session and haven't killed it yet, I can try switching between buffers (C-x b), but that usually only works on short trips and is rarely ergonomic.\n So if I'm not sure if the buffer is still alive, and if what I'm looking it belongs in the same project as what I'm looking for. recentf and history don't really land themselves well to exploratory navigation. \n What we're left with is find-file which looks and works amazingly with ivy, counsel, or even ido. But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you'd think it'd be necessary.\n Then I end up wishing I'd have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that's cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?\n    submitted by    /u/CtrlAltCool  \n [link]   [comments]",

Couldn't be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I've followed the community's advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I've learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It's great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.\n And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.\n Whenever I'm in a browser (can't use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I'm rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.\n How do y'all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs?

          "description": "Hello!\n When folding in org-mode, if I'm not on a heading, I use outline-up-heading to move to the parent heading of the content and fold the heading using org-cycle. However, in doing so, the cursor becomes trapped in the invisible region of the heading's content, as shown by invisible-p (point), in such a way that, if I quickly change my mind and want to unfold the heading again, I can't just org-cycle again; I have to manually move the cursor into a visible region of the header, like the beginning of the line, then org-cycle to unfold.\n So basically my question is: How do I move the cursor to a visible region after folding a heading, and not get stuck in an invisible region, and be forced to move the cursor manually?\n Thank you kindly for the help!\n  \nUPDATE: I've solved this using (while (invisible-p (point)) (backward-char)), but it seems a tad inefficient; is there a better way to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/ShadowRylander  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:\n  \nMake \"sent\" messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I've made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.\n \nI use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an \"undisclosed recipients\" email).\n \nI wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I've sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn't seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states \"this is a duplicate\".\n Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a \"sent\" box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?\n \n    submitted by    /u/WorldsEndless  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.\n https://preview.redd.it/uqy54hfckx581.png?width=151&format=png&auto=webp&s=e233620cda49876c919470b09d6f8f4867205329\n EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character \"t\" (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (<return>). \n (define-key company-active-map (kbd \"tab\") #'company-complete-selection) \n This above was causing the character \"t\", when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.\n (define-key company-active-map [tab] #'company-complete-selection) \n This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion. \n    submitted by    /u/asmodeus812  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there! :)\n I wanted to share a package that I have developed. This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. \n As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:\n - The user have access to all of the output from a session\n - The user gets a notification when a session has finished\n - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure\n - Sessions can be started on remote hosts\n - The user can easily rerun a session\n - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile\n For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if1W58SrClk\n And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache\n    submitted by    /u/squirelpower  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I come out of a hyrolo-fgrep query, my hyrolo file is in read-only mode. Which means that I have to change out of it every time I made an edit. I C-s'ed through the Hyperbole manual but couldn't find it mentioned anywhere.\n Since I am not yet very proficient with the inner workings of my kitchen-si *ahem* batteries-included computing environment I don't even have a good idea on how to debug it.

          "description": "For a while I've been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O'Toole. The blurb says:\n  \nCell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.\n  \nI decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I'd like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like \"killer app\" for Emacs. It may sound like I'm exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:\n  \nintegrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.\n integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.\n as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.\n easy CSV (etc) editing.\n derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).\n  \nI'm sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.\n Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O'Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/sfq42fmt8j581.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=276ef95ea7ecccc910ebca23905ba1bfc9a178fc\n [1] https://gitlab.com/dto/cell-mode \n [2] https://gitlab.com/dto/mosaic-el\n    submitted by    /u/marco_craveiro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member & lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.\n In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink.

What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs.

Also, Code completion with company works fine for Numpy which is a bit weird.\n Has anyone encountered this as well? I read somewhere that Numpy added some decorators that might interfere with some APIs, but this also happens for old Numpy packages in a Python 3.5 environment.\n Please help :)\n    submitted by    /u/Only-Adhesiveness889  \n [link]   [comments]",

My eyes just bounce around the screen without focusing on anything.\n Is there a way to build similar calendar and search screens on emacs that have instead a lot of white space and separation between items, and focusing in readability rather than on information density?\n I basically would like more structure and less text on screen.\n Some examples:\n  \nhttp://doc.norang.ca/block-agenda-nonproject.png\n  \nThis is a task list, but it just presents line after the other of tasks with very little structure and forces you to read through everything to find things rather than having more structure and less crowded text.\n  \nhttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/x2h2YKongReYZpjadF36L0fvICHhm0fZG4keZZlYmapLUzfpBHuIIBwgLu1AaCTSFmUhbneZ946iOxm60HFIpcrzEr5otlWbvHM5uDmE9OlTN9n4Q__2A6Obq28\n  \nVery crowded week-calenday-view with the tasks of one day just piling on top of the tasks of the next day and making it hard to get a clear, temporal view of the view.\n I haven't been able to find any examples with more readable and less crowded views.

How can I fix this? \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ducbueno__  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I've started testing Embark over the past few days - and it's already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it's extremely useful out-of-the-box, I've already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can't, because it doesn't understand the construct at point. Examples:\n  \nOrg mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.\n \nOrg mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including \"speed commands\", most of which could work without quitting the Embark \"prompter\", the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.\n \nOrg mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at \"rowgroup\", \"column group\" and \"subtable\", which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, \"eval formula\", so one doesn't have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c =.\n \nSyntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.\n \n From the looks of it, it's not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I'm going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I'd like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any \"extension packages\" that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?\n    submitted by    /u/TeMPOraL_PL  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some use it for programming or general writing, some for organisation, project management, email, web browsing, controlling media, and a **million more things. Basically, people use Emacs for whatever they want, which is fantastic! \n This makes it difficult to describe what exactly Emacs is to people outside our friendly little circle. Other editors can be described nearly completely with a short familiar phrase. Vim is an efficient text editor, VSCode is a powerful modern IDE, Vi is a last resort. But Emacs doesn't have a consistent and universally agreeable short description. \n My question is, what is Emacs to you? How would you describe it succinctly to someone who has heard about it, but not sure what all the fuss is about? \n My humble submission would be: \"the whatever you want text interface.\"\n *Mild exaggeration, but you get the picture\n ** Under exaggeration :)\n    submitted by    /u/azfrak  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can't control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).\n EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading.

I am interested to hear about feature parity and stabability - and also using eglot when editing remote files with tramp.\n Also as an aside, it would be great to have an LSP client package added in the standard distribution of emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/SEgopher  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a evil user, but I don't believe that has anything to do with my current problem. \n I'm trying to get LSP working in emacs. Specifically Omnisharp with Unity3D. \n I have installed lsp-mode and the Omnisharp server through the lsp-install command. When I look for the installed servers it also states that it is installed. However, when I try to use Emacs with my Unity project I get no auto-completion for anything related to Unity things (e.g. GameObject, Transform, etc.). I only get auto-completion for my own variables and such within my script. \n I get this error message: \n \"Warning (lsp-mode): Unable to calculate the languageId for buffer ‘acPlMovement.cs’. Take a look at ‘lsp-language-id-configuration’. The ‘major-mode’ is fundamental-mode\"\n It also says something about \"(Special LSP[Disconnected] company)\". \n I did read this page, but didn't find that I should need any special setup for the omnisharp server. - https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/\n I assume I'm missing something in my setup, but I haven't been able to google what I'm missing or what the problem could be. \n Could anyone here help me with this? \n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/AtZeroOne  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why is Emacs considered a bloat Software, in some communities, then? 12 MB doesn't seem much. \n And what do people mean when they say that Emacs is bloat or memory intensive? Is the core bloated?\n There are definitely people that are more for debating than actually addressing problems or having a discussion. So I'm really curious, is it that there is actually a real reason they are saying it, or is it just that it's a common \"saying\" of Vim users and users who find Emacs \"too difficult\"? \n Or is it that an average user uses so many packages that Emacs becomes CPU and/or memory intensive? \n What do you consider a bloat software?\n Also, even the guy in the video said that at 18:20: \n  \n\"All these things that people have said about Emacs having a big footprint and being memory intensive blah blah blah it's all true\" \n  \nI would love to hear your perspective on this commonly brought up \"contention\".\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Evaluating (window-text-width) for a fullscreen window returns 238, which indicates that 238 columns of characters should be able to be displayed on one line. However, using count-words-region, I can see that I can actually only fit 234 characters on a line without it causing wrapping (I'm using global-visual-line-mode, although this problem persists when it's off). This causes problems with any functionality that tries to right align content - for instance, org-agenda will try to align content so that the last character in a heading's tags is on column 238 (i.e. on the right side of the screen), but since column 238 is actually beyond the right side of the screen, the tags end up on the following visual line. Instead of\n * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: \n I end up with\n * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: \n ...which is significantly less information dense and generally uglier. I was content to set org-agenda-tags-column to 0, but I've recently picked up ledger, and this issue has also started messing up the formatting in its reports. This also happens regardless of how I split windows - if I split vertically, window-text-width reports a width of 118, but I can actually only fit 114 columns. Has anyone run into this before, or have tips for where to start looking? This seems like such a finicky, low-level thing I don't have much hope - especially since I haven't futzed around with any obvious culprits like font settings.\n    submitted by    /u/summetria  \n [link]   [comments]",

I initially was really enamored by the idea of using one system for notes, writing, and task, time, and project management, but found Org-agenda a bit too clunky and requiring too much thinking about how to set it up rather than using it. \n I'm interested in developing some more Org-centric apps in the future, and was wondering whether a note-focused Org app would be used at all if people heavily relied on TODOs and such sprinkled within their notes. Personally I think a separate application (possibly also utilizing Org-mode) for such things would be better, but that's just me!\n Let me know your workflows!\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/Tommerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought this is something similar to remember-notes, and immediately decided to write a note using this. I did that a few more times and stored them with C-c C-c.\n Now the problem is I don't know where to get them! Where are they stored? I have not set this up in any way in my init.el. I didn't even know about the existence of this command a few minutes ago.\n The documentation of this command does not give me any hints. Also, directly searching through org-mode info command index does not give anything. I can see the code for this in org.el but I am not a pro in elisp code reading and cannot figure out where exactly my notes are being saved.\n I do have the feeling from the code that this is actually not similar to remember-notes but perhaps has something to do with adding comments/notes to any org file item... but I may have understood wrong.\n    submitted by    /u/Imagi007  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello All *** TL:DR my experience*** I have been a part time emacs user for a decade now, with only 2/3 packages + maybe 30 lines of configuration added over the years.\n Lately i have been furstrated my my c++ IDE at work. I tried rtags a few years back but it crashed frequently. When checking the state of things recently I noticed LSP was getting big so I decided to give it a try to switch full time. I installed a few more packages like lsp, helm (love it). I even read the beginner's elisp intro to understand its syntax.\n That's when the rabbit hole started and i read about spacemacs and doom emacs\n *** doom/spacemacs : an overwhelming layer *** I get the reason for those distributions : having a curated set of packages preconfigured to work together + load time optimisations for an out of the box working experience. (+vim like experience for those who like it) \n My issue was that after installing i did not know where to start. These 100+ packages must be worth learning right ? I expected a kind of interactive walkthrough like emacs's own tutorial but ended up on the web documentation instead, which was also overwhelming.\n I wonder how people who have never used emacs/vim can get started easily on this. Do they use only 1% of the available features ? Is there a master tutorial somewhere that i missed ? \n And for people who like tinkering/debugging with their config to have exactly what they want, i find it much easier on a minimalistic example than when 100+ plugins are involved.\n ** who are those distributions for ? *** I have the feeling that beginners would be better off with a simple config with discoverability improvements like which-key/helm\n And for seasoned user who like tinkering with the defaults, i find that building your config helps you understand how to use the plugin you're using\n So fellow doom/space users, what made you jump on that train ? How did you get to \"master\" this complex environment ? \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Horrih  \n [link]   [comments]",

Don't get me started on all of the things I hate about this..BUT, one of the things I am disliking intensely the most is that I can no longer just type \"emacs filename\" at the command line, and invoke plain old non-GUI emacs. I've installed the GUI emacs from emacsformacsosx, and I have an alias so I can invoke it by typing \"emacs filename\", but of course it still invokes the efmo GUI version. I'm competent enough to sudo and follow clear step-by-step instructions (yeah, I'm one of those users that every sysadmin dreads..I know *just* enough to f everything up), but everything I've found assumes that you already have 'brew' or some other one (I forget the name)...and that's where I'm stymied. Does anybody have pointers to step-by-step directions for getting regular emacs back on my computer? (There are a lot of sites that say \"emacs comes already installed but it's not the best version\" but if that is true for Big Sur out of the box, for the life of me I can't find it (lots of files with emacs in the name do turn up when I do a 'locate' but none that seem to be actually executable).\n Thank you in advance!\n Annie\n    submitted by    /u/amitchell  \n [link]   [comments]",

In BODY, symbols of the type $N, where N is a non-zero, positive number, represent positional arguments. $* represents a list of optional remaining arguments. ,(+ $1 $2) expands to (lambda ($1 $2) (+ $1 $2)). See `lambda'.\" (let ((total 0) rest) (cl-labels ((search (form) (if (consp form) (progn (search (car form)) (search (cdr form))) (if (eq form '$*) (setq rest t) (let ((s (prin1-to-string form))) (if (string-match \"^\\\\$\\\\([1-9][0-9]*\\\\)$\" s) (let ((n (string-to-number (match-string 1 s)))) (setq total (max total n))))))))) (search body)) `(lambda ,(append (cl-loop for n from 1 upto total collect (intern (format \"$%d\" n))) (and rest '(&rest $*))) ,body))) \n With this macro, you can replace\n (mapcar (lambda (x) (with-output-to-string (princ x))) objects) \n with\n (mapcar ,(with-output-to-string (princ $1)) objects) \n If you want your lambda to accept an unlimited number of arguments, use `$*':\n (advice-add 'some-function :before ,(dolist (x $*) (message \"%s\" x))) \n What are the downsides?

          "description": "Hello all,\n I just discovered this sub, and have no Emacs experience. I hope my question makes sense. \n I regularly use remote Debian machines at work, interacting exclusively via SSH sessions. I was curious about using Emacspeak on them, as I’m visually impaired. Everything I’m reading is about setting up Emacspeak locally, though. I’ve found mention of a remote speech server, but haven’t found any guides on exactly how to get it to work. I use Windows as my primary OS at work. \n In summary, my usual workflow is: on Windows, SSH into Debian, and use a Windows screen reader to interact with the remote machine that way. If I can, I’d like to have Emacspeak running on the remote machine, with speech and sound output coming from my local Windows computer. The lag may make this unusable, I don’t know. I’d at least like to give it a shot, just to see what happens. Again, I’ve also never used Emacs in any way. I’m comfortable in Bash, though.

          "description": "Dear friends,\nI'm releasing phi-notes, an emacs package implementing a minor mode to work with a flavour of the Zettelkasten system I've been using for some years now.  It has the following characteristics:\nNotes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).\nNotes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).\nNotes may have \"parent\" and \"descendant\" notes; they may also be linked to project notes.\nBibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.\nNotes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).\nNotes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.\nThe aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.\nA sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:\n\nOther functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; \"killing\" and \"yanking\" to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.\nSome details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I'm calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.\nMore information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.\nMerry Christmas! 🎄",

If you're interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.\nHope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.",

I’m a PhD student in Archaeology, and I stumbled upon the world of Zettelkasten while trying to find a better way to make notes at the start of my PhD.\nI’ve jumped around quite a few different tools over the past year but there’s always been something that’s got in the way - apps were either too bloated or complicated or too buggy, or in some cases had awful font rendering.\nMy most recent favourite was iA Writer, and I think I was so attracted to it because I’ve learnt that I want something simple, minimal and distraction free.\nFor me, most options people seem to be using have too many bells and whistles and I want something that just gets out the way and leaves me with my text. iA Writer fit this bill perfectly but I found moving between notes and linking too cumbersome.\nSO I’ve purchased The Archive this week and I absolutely love it! Just as minimal and “clean” but with ease of navigation built in.\nI’m still in the process of getting familiar with The Archive but it seems to do everything I want it to. Before I was using subfolders but I’m thinking that I’m happy to lean in and just put all my notes in a single folder, and use tools like structure notes and other forms of hypertext to maintain connections and groupings where necessary.\nThe only thing I’m currently unsure of is how much to keep in my Zettelkasten. For example, my primary use case is academic writing, but I also want to keep notes relating to more personal topics of interest, e.g. notes about personal development, note taking, language-learning, etc. I’m not sure whether to combine everything or whether to keep my other interests separate.\nAnyways, looking forward to learning more from you all and getting to grips with the method and The Archive in greater depth.
