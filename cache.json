I found that manually entering the transaction with the hledger interface was too tedious for me.\n The tool uses the german FinTS standard, so the number of supported banks is limited.\n I've now released a new version that is mainly written in Haskell instead of Python. I did that because I noticed that I am much more likely to work on Haskell projects in my free time, simply because it is more fun for me.\n Unfortunately, this complicated the setup process somewhat, as one can no longer just run pip install fints2ledger. I would love to improve this in the future but don't really know a better way.\n Code feedback is also appreciated, especially from the perspective of people not too familiar with Haskell.\n Link to the tool: https://github.com/MoritzR/fints2ledger\n    submitted by    /u/TheOnlyHonk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are glad to announce streamly 0.9.0 release. streamly-0.9.0 and streamly-core-0.1.0 have been available on Hackage for some time now, you can find reference documentation and some guides on https://streamly.composewell.com as well. The website also has functionality to search across multiple streamly packages.\n This release did a major revamp of the API to make it easier to comprehend and less error prone to use. Now there is a single \"Stream\" type instead of the polymorphic \"IsStream\" type class. There are explicit concurrency combinators to enable concurrent behavior on the same type instead of using different types for that purpose.\n Dependency on GHC rewrite rules has been removed for more robust behavior and better programmer control, though it required splitting the stream type into the default direct-style type \"Stream\" and the CPS type \"StreamK\".\n The package has been split into two, streamly-core intends to depend only on boot libraries (currently has some more deps due to backward compatibility), streamly provides higher level functionality like concurrency.\n Parser functionality has been released. Parsers fuse with streams and are compatible with folds i.e. parsers are folds with more power.\n See the following docs for more details:\n  \nChangelog\n Upgrade guide\n  \nYour feedback is important to us we did the API revamp based on the feedback from users.\n    submitted by    /u/hk_hooda  \n [link]   [comments]",

A quick glance at the software stack and features:\n  \nVulkan for the rendering.\n The package effectful to keep the game logic independent from orthogonal aspects like logging, window handling, memory management and debugging.\n The package apecs for the overall game architecture.\n GLTF for importing 3D models from Blender.\n Features include moving pieces, 3D rotation, smooth zooming, a skybox, lighting and jumping knights :-)\n  \nAs you will recognize in the linked repository, the chess game is merely a running example of a larger endeavour: while implementing the game, I separated the reusable parts of the game into separate packages. The result of this process is hagato (Haskell Gamedev Toolkit), a collection of loosely coupled, easily combinable sub-libraries which can be used or ignored as desired, thus allowing developers to select features and technologies at will while remaining in full control of the overall game architecture. It makes use of the new cabal feature which allows one to put multiple public libraries into a single package.\n I published some additional packages on Hackage while implementing the game: apecs-effectful for integrating apecs into effectul, resource-effectful for managing resources in effectful, and chessica which implements the pure chess logic used in the 3D game.\n However, the chess game was just a testbed, to be honest. My overall goal is to use hagato now to implement the game I wanted to build in the first place, but I cannot share any details yet.\n    submitted by    /u/typedbyte  \n [link]   [comments]",

The corresponding functor laws are:\n traverse pure = pure -- purity law traverse (f <=< g) = traverse f <=< traverse g \n The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn't hold in general.

As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO.

Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age = Age Int or newtype Count = Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.\n But how would one distinguish which one is which?\n If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?\n One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.\n But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type?

But, that's probably not going to change any time soon.

For example, by defining a simple file I/O wrapper with __enter__ and __exit__ methods we can nicely and properly handle file reading and writting.\n Let me know what you think and if you have other ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/HappyTIIITAN  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been learning about tagless final. I prepared a simple usecase to just create user in a repository. I started with example based tests and also tried with property based testing. Had some doubts and got it clarified in stackoverflow. My intention was to have a defined set of rules for the UserAlgebra. Since the interpreters are expected to follow the same rules, it would be easier to develop. Usually, I start with an InmemoryInterpreter implementation. Later another interpreter would be implemented for the real persistence based repository. \n Slowly, I got pulled in cats-laws && disciple with scalacheck until I ran into a considerably long phase that I dont understand why the compilation fails. \n Here is the snippet. https://scastie.scala-lang.org/itsnashter/HxcapljGSZylOtLyssJbLg/2. Can experts take a look to help me understand the following? \n  \nWhat is the general convention to test the tagless final algebraic resources? I dont want to use unsaferunSync() even in tests. \n Is having laws for repositories like \"create and get\" ( & rest like mentioned in scastie) really needed ? The Laws look like they were meant for structures like Monad. \n Cats laws seem interesting but there is not much to understand for a beginner like me.

Each link/page randomly does a heavy computation and then renders a simple but very long HTML. I want to display a spinner when I click on either of the hyperlinks, until the computation ends and the dom is rendered. Without Future, on clicking either of the hyperlinks the page takes a while to update the dom, it kinda halts the browser, and then it renders my big azz ScalaTags HTML. The spinner does not get displayed (I toggle between display = none & display = block).\n But, when I set the dom to display the spinner in a Future, and then call the render function in another Future for the page clicked using QueueExecutionContext, now, I can see the spinner. \n Kinda weird! JS is still single threaded so why would the use of Future result in different behavior?\n Does this also mean that I should be using Future whenever I'm updating the dom?\n    submitted by    /u/Expensive-Photo7425  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I do have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with:\n ​\n 1) What technology stack should I consider?\n ​\n After careful consideration, I have made the decision to use tapir and http4s for my projects. However, I am currently torn between ZIO and Cats. Personally, I am leaning towards ZIO as it seems to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly effect system. Nevertheless, I am aware that Typelevel/Cats is more widely adopted in the industry. Could you please advise me on which one has a greater demand in the market?\n ​\n 2) Is it necessary for newcomers to have knowledge of Akka?\n ​\n I have some experience with GraphQL and have been exposed to RPC-like concepts and classic MVC patterns. However, I feel hesitant about diving into actors, as they remind me of the unnecessary complexity I encountered with redux-saga. Would it be mandatory for me to learn Akka for my first few projects, or can I initially focus on other aspects?\n ​\n Thank you in advance for your assistance!\n ​\n P.S. #1 I would greatly appreciate it if you could also recommend any helpful materials such as books or project ideas to aid me on this journey.\n ​\n P.S. #2 As a more serious and long-term project idea, I am considering developing a \"Job Aggregator (Scraper)\" or a \"Job Board.\" Personally, I lean towards the first variant as it aligns more with data processing, and I am eager to spend time designing a system that can scrape data in real-time and notify subscribers. \n P.S. #3 I would like to extend my appreciation to ChatGPT for its assistance in crafting this beautifully written post in English.\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/PilipchukBogdan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Fellow Scala Enthusiasts!\n I'm pleased to announce that Tyrian 0.7.0 has just been released. 🚀\n Tyrian is a Scala 3, Elm-like frontend web framework for Scala.js, and I'm particularly excited about this release. There's only a few real changes in it, but they're good ones! ...some of them are also quite fundamental to how Tyrian works, so please report any problems or come and say hello on our Discord server if anything looks odd: https://discord.gg/b5CD47g 😅\n First, one of the most requested features has finally been implemented: Tyrian now has frontend routing as standard. You can now make multi-page SPA's with minimal fuss.\n Second, Tyrian's tiny runtime has been completely rewritten, resulting in super snappy start up times, and better performance than ever thanks to the wizards behind Cats Effect 3.5. (Please don't forget that Tyrian works equally well with both CE and ZIO.)\n Third, another oft requested feature: You can now start Tyrian apps just by embedding the script in a page. No more launching via JavaScript if you don't want to!\n Finally, a small but welcome usability improvement around our CSS property naming. Properties are now available in `camelCase` as well as their original `kebab-case`.\n Full details are in the release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.7.0\n All examples and Tyrian's g8 template have been brought up to date, the docs site will probably lag behind a bit as usual. 😬\n I hope you give it a go, and don't be shy about hoping onto our Discord server if you need any help ...or even if you just fancy chatting about frontend dev, game dev, or to generally heap praise on Scala.js.\n Happy routing!\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

All you have to do is create a new repository based on this template repository (or alternatively fork it) and click “Create codespace on main”, that’s it.\n Such Codespaces template repositories exist for many languages, but I couldn’t find one for Scala. The repository is so simple and small that I wasn’t sure whether I should even post this here, but maybe it comes in handy for some of you.\n If you do give it a spin, please let me know what you think and what should be improved/added.\n All the best\n Lucas\n EDIT: Following u/BrilliantArmadillo64’s suggestion, I renamed the repo to reflect that it’s sbt-based.\n    submitted by    /u/typeduke  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everybody,\n The Scala tooling is a common complain within the community, lately, we have been lucky to get more and better tools, like scala-cli, metals, etc.\n Time ago, I had to do some work with js where I was able to try Vercel/Netlify, those tools are super handy, for example, Vercel allows to deploy js projects that use next.js with minimal effort, also, it provides Preview Environments to each Pull Request, this is something that I really wanted to get in Scala.\n Last year I started building a similar tool (https://codepreview.io), as of now, it only supports Preview Environments, still, different to Vercel, codepreview actually let's you try the whole application, imagine a scala backend, scala.js frontend, postgres database, all of them packaged as a temporal app on every Pull Request (with it's unique domain).\n It's been a few months since we have been using codepreview on internal projects + a few customer projects, so far, the feedback has been good.\n Unfortunately, the project isn't as nice as Vercel, it would be lovely to get this installed with a few clicks like Vercel does, instead, I need to do a few manual steps for every project. Besides this, there are also some other improvements to make but I'm not fully confident on what to prioritize. Which is why I'm coming here to ask for help.\n My offering is, I'll grant a trial/free license to whoever is willing to give codepreview a try, I'd only ask for feedback, which should help me to prioritize the future work.\n So far, we have been working mainly with projects that use https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager, still, projects building fat jars should also work smoothly.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/AlexITC  \n [link]   [comments]",

We moved from IntelliJ to VSCode + Metals a while back because of the lack of Scala 3 support in IntelliJ. But I'm having serious problems with the debugger, to me it's nearly worthless. It can't do the simplest things, like just step over code, it jumps to what feel like totally random places deep in the ZIO codebase. The only way I can get it to sometimes work is by using {} brackets so that I can put pure Scala code, no ZIO's, on their own lines, and only break there. Then run from break point to break point, stepping is essentially useless.\n Is it just me, or are others having the same experience? Any good tips, or workarounds? Has IntelliJ started to catch up with Scala 3 support?

As part of this I created a very simple hex-based tic-tac-toe game using Scala.js and the 3d library Babylon.js. It also uses Vite.js for quick dev turnaround, Electron.js for native packaging, and ScalablyTyped to create a Babylon.js facade.\n I was quite happy with the result. It was especially nice to program in Scala again (after a long break) and be able to imagine using it for both client and server code. Now I need to consider whether it is right for me, as there are a number of business issues around using Javascript, but at least the technical side seems possible.\n Since there were a few pains getting all the different libraries to play nicely together, I thought the result may be useful to other people. No tutorial, but my notes are in the README and the code is all available on Github. Be aware I am not a Scala expert, but the code works as far as I have tested it.\n I broke the code into a few pieces for libs for possible reuse, or other people to look to for ideas\n  \nHexTacToe https://github.com/jarrahtech/HexTacToe - the game itself\n kassite https://github.com/jarrahtech/kassite - Scala.js for (hopefully) functionality common to multiple Scala.js/Babylon.js games - currently has tweening and some shader material stuff. No tests yet - need to work on that\n babylonjsfacade https://github.com/jarrahtech/babylonjsfacade - Scala.js facade of Babylon.js 6.2 (generated within the Github project by ScalablyTyped).

This has left companies with a choice of either using legacy or investing in something that keeps changing.\n Too much power. It almost seems as though the power of Scala is limitless. Most articles I've read list a huge reel of concepts. Some of the ones that I can recognise seem powerful to the point of abusability, like metaprogramming.

I can publish for scala 3, and use the for213use3 functionality in my depending project, but then I will have binary incompatibilies between cats for scala 2 and cats for scala 3.\n Crossbuilding the dependency doesn't get me anywhere, because then I still can't use scala 3 features.\n What's my road ahead here, if any?\n    submitted by    /u/Martissimus  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, the documentation for my purescript-tecton library can be found at purescri.pt/tecton. Accordingly, PureScript Domains is now PureScript Domain (although previously-registered subdomains remain active).\n Second, a purescri.pt URL will automatically be activated for any package added to purescri.pt/registry. By default, it will redirect to the corresponding GitHub repository, but you can change this behavior or opt out through a simple pull request.\n If you would like to participate, please visit purescri.pt for details.\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/nsaunders1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have no idea where to begin troubleshooting this :) Anyone have any ideas?\n EDIT: the tex export shows the line \\section{{\\bfseries\\sffamily Discussion} and Conclusions} where the section header is.

          "description": "Usually org-mode manual is pretty exhaustive and very useful source of information. However it doesn’t offer an exhaustive list of all build-in properties, nor detail if and in what form they can be overwritten by user, and what happens if user so does anyway.\n This kind of list is the exact thing I am trying to parse together for myself. My current strategy is using the add propety function which lists all available properties, the Reserved Properties -listing under Properties section, which offers a glossary explanation of individual properties, and searching the Index for word ‘Property’, and once I find a new link, I visit it and hopefully find other properties near it.\n However, this is pretty slow way to gather the list, and it doesn’t really distinguish between useful properties, properties user can use if they want, and system-breaking properties.\n Usually better documentation is written in the relevant chapter of the manual, if the property is intended to be used.\n Has anyone written about this online? I found some youtube videos discussing some of the properties related to clocking, but generally it seems this information is written from the opposite direction from my approach: from usecase to property, not from property to usecase.\n I don’t have any good reasoning behind wanting this information. I just want to write it down in my notes, and while doing it gain some insight into org-mode as a system.\n What I mean by system breaking is something like CLOCKSUM_T. I haven’t yet tested the behaviour, but as this is used to calculate todays clocked time for a heading and it’s children, it is very clear that either the users input is overwritten, or the clocksum is inaccurate. This might not be strictly system-breaking, but neither does it make sense inside the system.\n    submitted by    /u/stepbroImstuck_in_SU  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is with packages which are loaded in a deferred way. Native compile doesn't have a chance to know whether a particular call is a macro or a function. For example, if my init.el is this:\n (with-eval-after-load \"evil\" (evil-define-key 'normal Info-mode-map (kbd \"m\") 'Info-menu)) \n It works if init.el is just byte-compiled. But native compilation gives a warning:\n init.el:3:4: Warning: the function ‘evil-define-key’ is not known to be defined. \n (Note with init.el is so small, it seems that native compilation doesn't happen automatically, so you may have to run (native-compile \"~/.emacs.d/init.el\") manually to reproduce this)\n And later I indeed have a problem when I restart emacs (it tries to call evil-define-key as a function, but it's not found because it's a macro)\n What could be the solution for this problem? Note, that I have almost everything loaded in a deferred way. One possible solution I see is that I load all the deferred packages somehow (is there an emacs/use-package function for this?), then call native-compile manually (instead of relying of the automatic native compilation) to make sure that native-compile sees all the macros.\n    submitted by    /u/geza42  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use default key bindings and meow, on Japanese keyboard with the help of key re-mapper called keyd for linux, and sharpkeys for windows. Here are the reasons.\n - Emacs default key bindings are the ones that are also used in other programs, like terminal. Getting used to text-operation stuff (like C-a/M-f) to some extent makes consistency.\n - I use Japanese keyboard on desktop and laptop so that I can remap <muhenkan>, <henkan>, and <katakanahiragana> key (they are on my thumbs position) to control, shift, and escape key. I want my keyboard layout to be the same on desktop and laptop, so thumb clusters keyboards are not my choice.\n - I use meow for modal editing. I've used evil, but I didn't like to configure evil key bindings for every different mode. I also didn't like to disable evil completely for some modes. I just wanted to use j/k and J/K (I map J/K to scroll up/down faster) in certain modes like magit, that do not require much text editing. The thing I like the most about meow is its motion mode. In motion mode, I can use j/k and J/K to scroll, and if I wanted to dispatch keys that are bound in major-mode maps, I can simply prefix them with SPC key (the default is Hyper key, I changed it). In magit for example, I can dispatch k (magit-discard) by pressing SPC-k. Any keys that are not in motion mode map follow the major mode map. I do not use meow keypad because I'm comfortable with pressing control key. But for those who are not, meow keypad might be good.\n ​\n What do you think? I see a key bindings discussion occasionally here so hope this helps.\n I would very appreciate your suggestion.\n https://github.com/0xsuk/.emacs.d\n    submitted by    /u/0xsuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone!\n I'm relatively new to Emacs and I'm trying to figure out which text-inputting framework I should use. I've never used Vim before, and I don't think I ever will. I have a keyboard with thumb clusters, which eliminates the issue of the \"Emacs pinky\" entirely. In fact, I find myself preferring chorded commands because they make me feel like a Jedi, with my keyboard as a lightsaber of sorts. It all started with cut/copy/paste when I was a child, and Emacs' style of running commands feels more like magical sorcery to me.\n Moreover, I use a different keyboard layout than the standard \"QWERTY,\" so the default movement keys in Vim (\"HJKL\") are less convenient for me.\n I've noticed that switching between insert and normal mode in Evil Mode throws me off a bit, but maybe I just need to get used to it. I often hear people say that Evil Mode is a superior way to edit text compared to the default Emacs keybindings. However, I wonder if this preference is mostly driven by those who started with Vim and are already used to modal editing.\n I'm curious to hear your thoughts. In your opinion, what makes modal editing either superior/inferior? I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have switched from Emacs to Vim (lol), especially if they inadvertently got used to Emacs keybindings first.\n Looking forward to your insights!\n    submitted by    /u/MysteryLiezer  \n [link]   [comments]",

VSCode has this built in and NeoVim can do this through telescope.\n It feels like there isn't a \"simple\" solution to this in emacs. find-file more or less requires me to type the path. Yes you get tab completion, but that's still pretty slow in comparison. And beyond that i seem to get into selectrum, orderless, marginalia and what not, which for one doesn't seem to solve this problem either, and feels needlessly complex for what i'm trying to do.\n So, my workflow has always been that i open my editor in my main projects directory. When i want to open a file, i press a hotkey and start searching with file and folder names. In 99.99% of cases i know exactly how the file is named and where it's located. I just don't want to have to type out the path. I'd rather type the parts of the path that are unique and get there quickly.\n What's the simplest solution for this? All i really need is a wrapper around fzf. fzf.el would do what i need, but doesn't work on windows. There is a fork of fzf.el that \"should\" fix that but i can't get it to work.

          "description": "I have started a mooc which uses Emacs. I have only previously used Dr.Racket and Anaconda so I'm having trouble with how I actually run programs in Emacs.\n I did the tutorial which covers how to edit and navigate text, open and save files.\n I just don't understand how you actually write some code and run it?\n In Dr.Racket or Anaconda, I could write some function in say python, that asks user for two numbers, and returns their sum. I'd write the code, click run, it would prompt me for the two numbers, I'd enter them and it would return their sum.\n Can anyone explain how I would do this in Emacs? I understand it's more powerful text editor I just really can't see how to do something simple like the above. I would like to learn how to use Emacs, and the course videos are all done using Emacs so ideally I'd like to be able to follow along with the videos.\n So yea if someone could explain how I could do what I know how to do in Anaconda, just write a simple function, run it and interact with it, then get a return. I think it might really help me understand the difference between Emacs and Anaconda etc. All the tutorials just talk about editing text. Not writing code, running it and giving it input and seeing the output? I'm sure I'm missing something very obvious but just struggling to see how you go from the text editing to actually running code I have written?\n    submitted by    /u/dumbfunction  \n [link]   [comments]",

But Emacs has provided the latest clue.\n I was trying to update my packages via M-x package-display-packages. This brings up the list of packages as expected, but when I try to 'update all' via 'U', I get the message \"waiting for refresh to finish\". Only it didn't, after many minutes, when it usually takes a few seconds.\n This lead to many rabbit holes, until I discovered that the problem happens on my home wifi network, but if I switch to my cellular network (via a phone hotspot), the problem disappears - I can refresh my package list almost instantly.\n This makes me suspect other issues with services hanging when on my home network (but not on my cell data) may be related. \n So: how does Emacs connect to elpa/melpa/etc? I'm hoping understanding this better might help me resolve my network issues.\n Other observations:\n  \nwhile the package update hung, I could still load webpages, including those for the repositories I use (elpa, melpa)\n \nusing curl -I to connect to the repositories also worked, even while I couldn't refresh the package list.\n \nI build Emacs from source, and the problem existed on the previous build yesterday (which was several months old), and the latest build from sources pulled last night.\n \n As I said, not an Emacs issue, but maybe Emacs not being able to contact the repositories is a clue to the network issue?\n Any suggestions?\n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/plantarum  \n [link]   [comments]",

In emacs it makes the editor unusable for about 10-20 seconds.\n So far I've tried enabling global-so-long-mode and disabling font locking in the inferior python buffer, which are the solutions I found online, but that is still resulting in unusable performance.\n Has anyone solved this? Two potential solutions I thought of would be either to find a way to truncate output and creating a command to expand it when needed, or to find a way to connect to a remote python repl running in another terminal tab, but I'm not sure how to do either of those.\n    submitted by    /u/mumbo1134  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have all my config in a single giant org mode file. This file produces three others when tangled, init.el, early-init.el and a custom theme for my colorscheme. Problem is, whenever I make a change in the org file, and tangle the changes, the git repo for my dotfiles now sees two different files being modified (obviously) with the same changes. It makes it really cumbersome to do proper commits, since if I did many changes and I'd like to do various commits for each of them, I have to add not only the changes in the org file, but also hunt down the same modifications in the init and early-init files (mostly init tho).\n I recently tried to fix this by dropping all of the init.el contents into some other file, call it \"real-init.el\". Then, I would have a very minimal init.el that would check if init and early-init exist, and if they don't, it would tangle the org file and restart emacs. I would just keep track of the org file and the minimal init file in the git repo, and since the init file is very minimal and wouldn't change very often, it would be a fine compromise.\n For some odd reason, while the files did get tangled, emacs would just restart indefinitely. It opened, then closed, then opened, then closed. I had to force kill it.\n Has anyone else faced this problem? How did you solve it?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a long time, I didn't annotate my reading materials because I preferred reading on my tablet instead of my computer. And I never found a good app to use on my Android tablet either. And of course, without proper conversion to org-mode, all of those notes seemed useless.\n Then I discovered org-noter. I was excited but couldn't use it. The automatic window handling was frustrating, and I couldn't invest the time to fix it. Recently, I needed to take notes from multiple books, so I tried org-noter again, but I still can't find the best workflow.\n My initial issue was with the way how org-noter creates a \"special\" layout with a dedicated window. It sometimes even creates another frame - which I especially hate, even setting org-noter-always-create-frame to nil still occasionally creates a frame. I guess not a huge deal, I can live with that.\n After taking some notes, I noticed they were out of sync the next day. I tried to fix each note's page number manually - :NOTER_PAGE: prop, but it would randomly change the page numbers in other notes. Yes, I would open a page in pdf-tools, then I call org-noter-sync-current-page-or-chapter to check if the note and the page numbers match and fix them (when needed). But it also would change page numbers in some other notes. I can't figure out why. Clearly, either I'm doing something wrong, or I need to set some vars or it's just a bad combination of things, versions of pdf-tools, poppler, Emacs, etc. on my machine causing these issues. Maybe (like so many things) it just never properly worked on Mac?\n I want this tool to work, but I am struggling to find a workflow that fits. If my notes are consistently out of sync, I can't see the point of using org-noter. Can someone please advise me on their workflow, tips, and configuration?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For me, one thing that is important other than the technical aspects (and Emacs most certainly helps me to work faster and more efficiently on my novels) is the question of self-motivation. To help me with that, I have made a little function that shows me the current progress I have made today when I press s-#.\n It even has a \"graphical\" aspect to it, the color changes bit by bit from gray to green, and it simulates a \"bar\" that fills up. The number of characters/pages needed for my daily goal to be done is in a variable I have in my init file.\n I am sorry I opened a new thread, I wanted to post this in the thread \"Emacs for literature\", but I don't know how to post a picture in an answer to thread. So here is the Minibuffer a few times during the day, to give you some idea of what I mean.\n It is in German, the translation would be: 92.791 characters, 30 pages, equals 56 percent [today new: 0/2] Current page 93 percent, scene 1 page, chapter 1 page.\n In the modeline, I also show what \"page\" I am on. It just divides the length of the Buffer through the average number of characters on a standard page (3000 characters). Must seem like a very un-Emacsy way of doing things to you, but it helps me to get a feeling of getting things done somehow. :) \n https://preview.redd.it/unxa09de2l1b1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c7e520182c65caa1f4513aa336507c96b71fdc\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tangle the website out of Orgmode into HTML files. If you are interested, the english version, which is somewhat outdated though, is www.titusmueller.de/index_en.html. I need to get the German content translated and bring it up to date.\n Then there is the Agenda for my reading tour through many cities, my e-mails via Mu4e ... You get it: I am hooked.

But if I exit with C-x C-C (or switch to TTY2 and killall emacsclient) and run startx a second time, Emacs freezes and the frame shows up smaller and in the top-left corner of the screen.\n If it helps here's my .xinitrc:\n # Disable access control for the current user xhost +SI:localuser:$USER # Make Java applications aware this is a non-reparenting window manager export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 # Set default cursor xsetroot -cursor_name XC_crosshair # Set keyboard repeat rate xset r rate 200 60 # Start emacs # emacs --daemon --eval \"(require 'exwm)\" -f exwm-enable exec emacsclient -c \n And here's the relevant bit of my init.el:\n (use-package exwm :straight t :config (require 'exwm-config) (setq exwm-workspace-number 1) (exwm-enable)) \n Also there's this in early-init.el that might be relevant but I doubt it:\n (push '(fullscreen . maximized) initial-frame-alist) (push '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t) default-frame-alist) (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t frame-resize-pixelwise t) \n How can I find out what's causing the issue?

I've ordered the book purely to appreciate the insights in this article. I'm of course convinced I will find a lot of good stuff in it, but I haven't even began digging into it. But I did create the following little snippet that has in the last 24h already improved my quality of life significantly:\n ``` (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t) ;; Introduce a bottom side window that catches ;; compilations, deadgreps etc. (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist '(\"\\deadgrep.\\|\\Compilation\\\" (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . 0) (window-parameters (no-delete-other-windows . t))))\n (defun deets/side-window-resize (enlarge) (let ((bottom-windows (window-at-side-list (window-normalize-frame nil) 'bottom))) (dolist (window bottom-windows) (when (symbolp (window-parameter window 'window-side)) (if enlarge (window-resize window (window-height window)) (window-resize window (- (/ (window-height window) 2))))))))\n (defun deets/side-window-toggle (arg) (interactive \"P\") (cond ((null arg) (window-toggle-side-windows)) ((listp arg) (deets/side-window-resize t)) ((symbolp arg) (deets/side-window-resize nil))))\n ;; Remove our side-windows (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro \"C-x w\") 'deets/side-window-toggle) ```\n When compiling or grepping, the window is placed a the bottom. I can quickly enlarge/shrink the window, and toggle it. Very happy with this, and I'm already thinking about further improvements.\n    submitted by    /u/__deeetz__  \n [link]   [comments]",

So do these two keybindings have different functionality in different contexts, or are they always the same? Because why have two enabled by default? (Maybe for user convenience of different keyboard layouts, but this is a bit too confusing more than necessary, maybe the devs meant to implement keyboard layout detection but failed..?).\n This All may seem dumb to be asking, (like why not just rebind C-- to zoom out and get over with it) but I'm confused thinking that there probably should be a good reason this is not by default in Emacs yet.\n Maybe I'm just thinking too highly of the \"intelligent design behind Emacs\"?

At its most basic, it will read from and write to a database, usually through Forms that have been customized to display certain information from a database in a certain layout. And because it works with one source of truth (e.g., it can connect to SQL and PostgreSQL databases), multiplayer data entry and collaboration is more feasible than in a purely plain text method being shared by a syncing service.\n The problem is, Microsoft Access is one sin shy of being the devil. It’s proprietary and buggy, and coding in VBA is a nightmare compared to most languages, especially our beloved elisp. Someone said MS Access is the best worst way to make a database program, and I think that sums it up well.\n I know emacs can interface with SQL databases, but are there any packages that try to accomplish something like Microsoft Access, i.e., rapid application development via forms that display and allow editing certain fields from a database?

I don't want just a repl but a buffer where I can send files or selected code to the repl and receive the output in the repl buffer. Is there a good plugin I could maybe learn from in order to write it or does anyone know of one already that I haven't been able to find?\n    submitted by    /u/joshuacottrell  \n [link]   [comments]",

(my-org-mode mode with a keymap containing \"C-c a\"). I can add a hook for org-mode to also enable my-org-mode, and on change-major-mode hook to disable my-org-mode.\n Then I could make this mode have higher precedence than org-mode using 'emulation-mode-map-alists. (Basically what this is saying but for every mode I define bindings for)\n Could do the same for a \"global map\" that will have lower precedence than the mode-specific ones.\n Then for the bindings I don't define it should \"just work\".\n Is this a decent idea for trying to achieve what I want or am I way overcomplicating this?\n Also are there any packages that could help me do this or do I have to code it up myself. I don't mind coding it but would like to save some time.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/zackattackz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Switching between 2 or 3 or more layouts would be awesome.\n No need to save them between emacs sessions, but that could be interesting as well.\n Ideally such concepts as..\n - layout list\n - layout create\n - layout switch\n - layout kill\n I've been fiddling with 0blayout package, which covers most of it. No layout list, but layout-switch with vertico more or less covers it.\n The problem with that one is it doesn't seem to save/restore the location for each window..\n ex: If I make a layout which is split into a top and bottom window A and B, with code on top and an org file on bottom, and then switch to some other layout.. and then back, it'll prooperly restore the window layout for A and B and bcak to those files... great! HOWEVER, if A and B are the same file, but different locations within it, that doesn't work.. both windows A and B will switch to the same file, the same position within it. \n I guess I could look into saving window layouts to registers and popping around that way, but I was sure there was a more sophisticated way of doing it.\n (I forget if Bufler does this .. I use filetree as my buffer-list replacement, and bufler doesn't work well when Tramp with remote sessions are alive.. so I've generally ignored Bufler the last year or two.)\n Thanks for reading :)\n    submitted by    /u/FrozenOnPluto  \n [link]   [comments]",

Installing a language server in each venv seems a bit of overkill, especially since I am always going to use the same language server and the people I work with on Python projects don't need the (same) language server (as they use something like VSCode with Pylance). \n On the other hand, installing the language server in the venv saves me a bit of work creating the relevant config files to ensure they run the commands with the right binary (e.g. I don't need to create a mypy.ini files to ensure mypy runs from the venv, nor do I need a pyrightconfig.json to point the server to the venv).\n I found a way to get both pyright and pylsp working on Emacs, whether they are globally installed or installed in the venv.

          "description": "I need a piece of elisp that would return the project name for the buffer at point. Seems simple, right? The problem is, I can't find a way to do this reliably. Let me explain.\n If I have a dir structure like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── proyecto-tres \n And the current buffer is readme.org, getting the project name - 'proyecto-uno' is fairly easy, if you're using projectile, you can do (projectile-project-name), right? Alternatively, you can use: (magit-toplevel), which returns full path, i.e., ~/projects/proyecto-uno/ and then you can just grab the last segment.\n Now, it gets tricky when you're using git-worktrees and the structure of the project is like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── .bare ├── master ├── development ├── .git ├── readme2.org ├── proyecto-tres \n The current buffer is readme2.org. How do you get the project name? (projectile-project-name) returns development (and I want 'proyecto-dos'). (magit-toplevel) returns full path to \"development\" dir not to 'proyecto-dos'. \n So then you may suggest, why don't you check, if the buffer is inside a worktree? And that I don't know how to. I assumed I could use (magit-inside-worktree-p), but it always returns t, regardless of where it's called from, readme2.org, or from inside 'proyecto-uno' dir. \n So how do I find the project name reliably?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

Without the state juggling and flow control of transient, you cannot make the same level of expressive user interface.\n Some of the topics that get beyond the surface and require thinking about how you would use this software to build applications\n  \nFlow control\n History & state\n Custom infixes\n  \nIn particular you can also be forgiven for thinking custom infixes are some kind of crazy extensibility without much practical value. This is far from the truth. Attaching complex values to your user input command sentences and quickly modifying any part of these sentences allows you to express a lot of rich commands in a short time. That is the secret to the efficiency of magit, and magit doesn't even use very complex flow control. Infix overriding allows your interface to reflect and follow the state of the application.\n I'm not terribly incentivized to go beyond the showcase, which at worst contains working examples for just about every behavior. It is less complex code than magit and made of examples that demonstrate behavior in isolation. However, if the demand is interesting and severe, I may be spurred into finishing a richer demonstration.\n    submitted by    /u/Psionikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like Edebug because it allows to follow the computation even in a single form, from the inside out. Like, given something like\n (+ 3 (/ 4 n))\n I can see exactly not only what n is, but also what are the intermediate results. The closest thing I found for now is Sly's stickers, but I wondered if there was an actual equivalent. Otherwise, I find CL's debugger a bit difficult to use in step-mode, but that could easily being me not having read the manual thoroughly. So, does a CL-Edebug exist, much like CIDER's for Clojure? And if not, can I use SLIME/Sly to step between forms (from inside out)?\n P.S., IIUC Sly is the improved (better?) version of SLIME.

          "description": "I've been using org-roam for a while, and it's going great; however, I sense some inconvenience with having a big amount of encrypted org files, especially when they don't use the same key. This makes it much harder to search through the notes since I've to decrypt them each. So I was thinking if giving up the mix for having all the notes to be encrypted in one directory would fix that, like having all the notes encrypted by default but all of them also decrypt at once, so they become easier to search & query. But I don't know even how to do that, the best came to my mind is to encrypt the directory itself, but I also have no idea of how this can be done :P \n Any suggestions? \n p.s. I use disk encryption already if that matters, but I want extra protection.\n    submitted by    /u/larrasket  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could make the whole thing a macro that does nothing on non-Windows, but that seems overly complicated.\n Also a related question if I may: I'd like to replace the above setqs with defvar but in such a way that it always sets my value, not just if the var is undefined. Is there a standard way to do that?\n    submitted by    /u/simplex5d  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! \nI adopted a Plain Text workflow a few years ago. I am on Linux/Windows environments. I'm not tied to any editor (hence my use of markdown). I use various VIM flavors, VS Code, notepad, and have tried emacs, Zettlr and Obsidian. I'm fairly comfortable using any of those but am mainly using Zettlr right now. I use pandoc to generate most everything I need either to HTML, docx or PDF via LaTeX. My reference manager of choice is Zotero. I use hypothes.is \"somewhat,\" but not much. I haven't figured out a good way to just pipe those notes into Zotero where I'd prefer them. My \"inbox\" is Zotero.\nWhy am I looking at Zettelkasten after all these years? Because I'm adventuring out into new phases in my life where I think notetaking and writing are going to become far more important. Mainly in the area of Genealogy. Genealogy has overlap with many topics/cross-overs in history, anthropology, social sciences, archive/library science, DNA, general research, writing. I need a better way to process and use information. While I have degrees in history, anthropology, and engineering, I've work in more practical fields, mainly Tech, for years and am well out of practice in research and writing.\nSince I haven't seriously written or researched in years, I need to shake the rust off. As part of that effort, I want better techniques to process and store what I've read. I think the \"commonplace\" tradition (and I fit Zettelkasten in that category for this discussion) is the only methodology that seriously considers the process of taking notes and tying them together. There is, I believe, a fairly complete workflow from figuring out what to read, how to read it, how to take notes about it, how to process those notes (including storage), how to tie notes together, and how to use them for output.\nAlso, it seems to be the most amenable method to fit into my plain text workflow.\nI do have more specific questions, mainly around my notes in Zotero and what to do with them, but I will post them separately.",

The introduction seems to have some fascinating material on the form and structure as well as decisions on how they decided to present and publish it.\nFor those unaware of his work, primarily as a political economist, he wrote extensively on media and communication theory including the influential works Empire and Communications (1950) and The Bias of Communication (1951). \nWhile I appreciate the published book nature of the work, it would be quite something to have it excerpted back down to index card form as a piece of material culture to purchase and play around with.

          "description": "How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.\nI'll start.\nI'm reading some lightweight new books:\nJalāl al-Dīn Rūmī and Gafori, Haleh Liza. Gold, Simon and Schuster. 2022.\nFaulkner, Grant. The art of brevity: crafting the very short story, Prometheus Books. 2023.\nI've released the pressure cooker steam that I put myself in by taking a graduate-level writing seminar on food. since the class ended, the floodgates burst, doubling the time spent in the garden of my ZK. Some of my structure and sub-hub notes have gotten large, and I find I'm looking at refactoring them. Thinking about structure note size, I'm not sure smaller is better in the age of fast search. I have a bunch of search tools/extensions that help focus link creation and finding stuff for the output side of zettelkasting. A technique I'm stealing from someone on the forums is when placing a note on a structure note to look closer at links already on the structure note for link candidates. The fact that they are placed in a particular section of a structure note means the note is surrounded by ideas that relate. Or maybe I can figure out a way to link to a section of structure notes. (I already have a method of linking to a specific place in a note but don't use it in this workflow.)\nPython programming continues to be exciting, and having a large collection of notes as a playground has been fruitful. I've expanded \"Idea Explorer\" to provide more information about a note thread. It now has tabs for the \"Tag Map\" and a tab with all the one-sentence summaries of the notes listed together.  I continue to work with trending for my ZK dashboard. Part of which is behind \"My Ten-day Zettel Production.\"\nOnce again, writing precedes my thinking.\n\nMy ten-day zettel production.",

          "description": "Philosopher Richard Y. Chappell has written a straightforward and readable Git+Pandoc software setup and workflow guide suitable for academic writing. [Academics don't want you to know this secret trick: this free software setup is workable for writers of all kinds.] Professor Chappell's guide walks you through the software installation, which includes git for version control, Pandoc for document processing, and the VSCode editor with plugins for Pandoc citations and document export. After the one-time software installation, the writer begins each document with a Markdown template. The Markdown template includes some LaTeX macros for page formatting--Prof Chappell recommends installing the MikTeX LaTeX distribution. Modifying the Pandoc LaTeX template is unnecessary (though I have done this to avoid repetition): add LaTeX packages and macros to the Markdown document template as needed.\nThe setup is interesting and will get you part of the way to a Zettelkasten with VSCode. The installed software and workflow are compatible with Zettlr and Obsidian, though this requires additional configuration.",

          "description": "I have a specific example for a concept I want to capture within my Zettelkasten, but I'm having a hard time identifying how to go about it.\nSITUATION\nI'm reading my book on product management when I encounter this infographic which essentially summarizes the entire book in one image.\nI'm ECSTATIC!  This contains each of the individual pieces of the system (atomic ideas).  But then my enthusiasm dies down as I realize this image is essentially MULTIPLE ideas in one graphic, triggering analysis paralysis as I consider how to capture this within my Obsidian-based Zettelkasten.\nMY QUESTION FOR YOU\nBefore you read on, pretend you ran into this information.  Your goal is to use your Zettelkasten to help you write strategy documents for your company AND to write articles for product managers in startups to help them launch better products.\nHow would YOU capture the gold within this infographic within your Zettelkasten?\nOPTIONS I'M CONSIDERING\nNow that you've considered your own solutions, here's a few I thought of.\nCreate one Obsidian Canvas, capturing the entire infographic (a Card for each part of the flowchart and each checklist).  Then begin creating Zettels or linking existing Zettels for each individual component, replacing each Card with a Note instead as I go.\n\n\nTechnically, this option violates the \"Atomic Notes\" rule since my first Zettel would be this full infographic - I'd be essentially capturing a contextualized idea, then breaking it down, which may not yield surprise insights as going bottom-up should.\n\nCreate an Overview Zettel (simple text file) with each item written out, then use this Overview Zettel to create individual Zettels from there.\n\n\nSame concept as #1, but in a text file rather than a Canvas.\n\nKeep this infographic in my Lit Note (aka Reference) and create individual zettels as I go.\nDoes one of these align with what you would do?  If so, which one and why?  If not, how would your approach differ from any of mine?\nThanks in advance!",

Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.\nI'll start.\nI finally released my project that extends The Archive, showing an \"Idea Explorer\" on demand for every note. This can be thought of as a way to look at \"note sequences.\" Sequences that develop an idea. I'm looking for collaborators to develop this idea further. Idea Explorer - an extension exclusively for The Archive.\nThis past week I've had the opportunity to practice and work on my technique for onboarding videos into my ZK. Speed and timing are critical—speed in taking notes and timing in reviewing the event. I feel I've gained a little success making a rough, rough draft during the presentation, then immediately after, as part of the process of watching a video, I expand my notes as I would if they were highlights from an article. Having a few minutes of uninterrupted time immediately after the video presentation to fill in my thoughts on my note is critical.\nI'm looking to do more of this. I get excited when I onboard live streams or Zoom events more than videos where I can start, stop, and replay the action. They feel more dynamic, and they spark my juices.\nMaybe I should try sketch-noting. It just feels like my skills at sketching are so poor that I'd miss stuff with the fast pace of a live presentation. Maybe this would be best reserved for youtube videos.\n\nMy ten day zettel production",
