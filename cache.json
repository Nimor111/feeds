Most of the speed is achieved using a token-matching heuristic, where the similarity scores are only computed between pairs of names sharing an entire token, with token inventories being precomputed and stored in a hashmap.\n It works pretty much exactly as I want so far, but as a Haskell beginner I'm sure there are improvements that can be made, and I figured this would be a good place to ask.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/osoleve  \n [link]   [comments]",

Similarly, if a column is of a domain that constrains the value to be non-negative, it may make more sense to use an unsigned type such as Word64 instead of Int64.\n Consider the following code:  data Rec' a b = Rec { a :: a, b :: b } type Rec1 = Rec' Scientific Scientific type Rec2 = Rec' Integer Integer type RecField = Rec' (Field SqlNumeric) (Field SqlNumeric) $(makeAdaptorAndInstance \"pRec\" ''Rec') recTable :: Table RecField RecField recTable = table \"rec\" (pRec Rec { a = tableField \"a\", b = tableField \"b\" }) \n If I try to use selectTable recTable and runSelect to read a [Rec1] it's fine, but if I try to read a [Rec2], I get a compilation error (No instance for (Opaleye.Internal.RunQuery.DefaultFromField SqlNumeric Integer).

Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.\n I've written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I'm trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I'm running into difficulty - as I'm making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I'm working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -> Int function but not an Int -> IO Int.\n Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn't great and it's unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of 'dirty' using unsafePerformIO, but I can't immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.\n Thanks very much for any help.\n Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs\n    submitted by    /u/HHHQuestions  \n [link]   [comments]",

We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. For this role we expect hands-on experience with a couple of large Haskell / OCaml projects, and/or managing a team.\n Feel free to reach out to me directly if you're interested and have any questions, but applications should go via this link: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100017588\n A more junior role that I advertised before, also in London, is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job=2100012204\n Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.\n    submitted by    /u/dreixel  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the official wiki I found https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ which looks like an incredible piece of software engineering and I immediately watched their 25 minute video of demonstration and quite fell in love with it. BUT I am worried that using this would take away a lot of classical Haskell, because to me it seems a lot like Django or similar frameworks. With their different custom syntax operators like |> I feel like I’d be more learning their framework than actually Haskell. Is that a legitimate concern? My main goal is not to build a wonderful web app that makes me $$$ but just to build something with Haskell that is useful and that I can extend over time. \n Would a more lightweight framework be more appropriate and if so which? Is my impression of it not being really haskelly wrong?

My initial implementation using explicit recursion looked like this:\n dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a] dropWhile _ [] = [] dropWhile p xs@(x:xs') | p x = dropWhile' p xs' | otherwise = xs \n This also seems to match the implementation used in the GHC source code.\n After some perusing I found an example using foldr as follows:\n dropWhile :: (a -> Bool )-> [a] -> [a] dropWhile p = fst . foldr f ([], []) where f x ~(xs,ys) = (if p x then xs else x:ys, x:ys) \n After some head wracking I do understand the second definition. However I would like to know if this is a situation in which the implementation using explicit recursion is preferable as it is easier to reason about?\n    submitted by    /u/Bizare123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was playing around with fancy record libaries and was very impressed with how well labels can infer types. Probably because it avoids unnecessary complexity and less-frequently-used operations.\n So I wanted to try how much unnecessary complexity and infrequently operations I could throw on top of it while maintaining reasonable type inference. Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.\n union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) => a -> b -> c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: (\"foo\" := String, \"bi\" := String, \"bar\" := Int, \"baz\" := Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: (\"foo\" := String, \"bi\" := String, \"bar\" := Int, \"baz\" := Double) \n The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:\n type family Concat l r where Concat '[] a = a Concat (x ': xs) a = x ': Concat xs a \n I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:\n l :: Proxy '[1,2] l = Proxy r :: Proxy '[3,4] r = Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c => Proxy a -> Proxy b -> Proxy c cat _ _ = Proxy c1 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c1 = cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy '[3,4] c2 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] c2 = cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy '[1,2] c3 = cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy '[1,2,3,4] \n And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1\n You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks.

Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it's variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). \n I'm interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to \"desugar\" syntax into it's core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I've considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I'm looking for. However I can see it's been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.\n Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I'm interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it's interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.\n I'm aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated.

I like to work with org-mode babel for Haskell, i.e., without a specific project directory, just babel source blocks interacting with a non-project REPL. My Emacs non-project Haskell stuff works, I'm guessing, because it's relies on my ~/.stack/global-project. But let's leave that aside for now.\n So let's say I'm just trying to get a plain-vanilla project to work with an outside package. So I create a new project with stack new basicmath And let's say I'm trying to get Diagrams to work just like they give with the example code here, i.e., \"Your First Diagram.\" I'm trying all the install instructions at the command prompt in .../basicmath/, none work. I'm guessing something needs to happen with the basicmath.cabal or the stack.yaml? But I look in vain for any concrete examples. Confusing to me also is whether to actually use cabal when I'm supposed to be using stack. In any case, nothing works. How exactly would I make the example code work?\n I'd eventually like to see this work on the Emacs babel side, but I won't get greedy yet. Emacs babel is just a wrapper apparently for feeding multiple lines into a non-project global REPL, i.e., fraught.\n A really good tutorial on this would be nice to find, BTW. Most of what I've seen is just someone's stream-of-consciousness hypnosis ramblings, i.e., leaving a beginner to do guess-and-test over and over. And beginner books don't talk about it either; rather, you simply put code in a file and load it at the REPL as you work through these books. (I did find one book that walks you through a project creation. But it has no example of adding a non-Prelude package.) Would another IDE handle adding packages better?

I'm starting to think I'm fundamentally confused. \n Following through citations (Polysemy cites Kiselyov and Ishii, who cite Kammar, Lindley, and Oury, who cite various papers by Plotkin and Pretnar) strongly suggests that \"extensible effects\" are just a rebranding of \"algebraic effects\", and that equational reasoning gets left out of implementations because that's more practical (but Polysemy's trying to add it back?). Is this a good understanding of the situation?\n Similarly, in Petnar's representations of algebraic effects (e.g.), it's quite important that the handlers have access to the computation's continuation, and get to decide how it's used. I haven't been able to find any support for this in Polysemey, but everything's phrased so differently it's difficult to search. \n Any suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and practice, or for quickly getting up to speed on the last twenty years of research in this area?\n    submitted by    /u/ShapeOfMatter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have documented it with more detail in the changelog entry. The most interesting one is making Fake type as a transformer which allows writing efficient code more easily. This was done by Isaac Van Bakel and more details are here: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata#using-the-faket-transformer\n The current release also adds various new modules (+ 15), locale improvements and contains updates to fake data sources. Also, the test suite has been enhanced which helped me find bugs in the upstream Ruby data sources (Corresponding fix: https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/pull/2339) . And thanks to Tristan de Cacqueray for fixing the test failure issues related to random 1.2.0 as part of ZuriHac.\n The following packages can be used to create generators out of fakedata:\n * quickcheck integration by Jappie Klooster: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata-quickcheck\n * hedgehog integration by Matt Parsons: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hedgehog-fakedata\n    submitted by    /u/sibip  \n [link]   [comments]",

I decided to try new things and bought a farm and spent the last 5-6 years growing food, working outside etc. However, I find myself wanting to go back and at least pick up contracts/gigs to make some additional income, invest more into my retirement etc.\n It has been 6 years since I looked at Scala and I know things have changed since.\n A few questions: 1) what is the easiest/best way to get back in the game and refresh/catch up on everything that happened in the language? and 2) will anyone even consider me after a multi-year unrelated gap in my resume? When I \"retired\", I was at the senior level but obviously do not expect to get back at that level (no ego here).

I know that it's supposed to work with scalatest only and I've seen in scalamock guide that you can implement your own MockFactoryBase and it should somehow work, but I didn't really work for me(maybe I just understood guid wrong). \n I create separate instance of the mock in every test context\n test(\"blah blah\") {val myMock = mock[TraitToMock] ...}\n Also my project is written using cats-effect, so I'm running tests also with it's IO \n And in process I faced multiple issues such as:\n java.util.ConcurrentModificationException: mutation occurred during iteration\n It seems it's because in UnorderedHandler(which is used in my tests) handle method they're using synchronization, but in parent Handler class operations with handlers are not synchronized.\n https://preview.redd.it/7sflfd9ud0a71.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=8eae336304b348946886066c1214c950229c0b71\n https://preview.redd.it/0nglptufe0a71.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=0db3228a4f760d921e495a122ef8c6350364d995\n Wrapping this methods in synchronization helps and tests don't fail.

For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.\n Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.\n I don't have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.\n Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?\n My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. \n Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 \n tagging /u/makingthematrix \n Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.\n ​\n Thanks a tonne\n    submitted by    /u/ivanvelikanov  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or simply - what would you recommend?\n From what I've explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.\n How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?\n In a similar vein, what's your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).\n I'm also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I've read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.\n Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?\n My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.\n Warm thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DanManPanther  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd prefer to keep it as a Flow if possible.\n I wrote this up as an example App on Scastie: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/baWl6EB7TkSjL7DMV2ZX5Q/2\n I appreciate that identifying the last element of a stream is a tricky problem. \n It seems like there is some precedent for making this kind of thing work. For example, it seems that the FileSource can close a file handle before the full stream has completed. FileSource is implemented as a more complicated custom graph stage. I'd prefer to avoid that if possible, but I don't mind doing it if necessary.\n    submitted by    /u/elastiknn  \n [link]   [comments]",

This problem is a little different than usual because it wants you to return a sequence and not just the length. I feel like I found the length in an efficient way, using dynamic programming. But because I am new to scala and not that great at algorithms, I don't think I constructed the subsequence efficiently. Here is my code: \n /* * Assignment: Longest increasing subsequence * * Sequences are a natural source of computational problems.

The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.\n Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? \n If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity's rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/EthelMerman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Introduction\n When I saw opaque types and inline methods, I quickly thook about type-level assertions evaluated at compile time. I was pretty hyped by this idea so I made Iron.\n Iron uses Dotty's inline and opaque types to create almost zero-overhead (and true zero-overhead for the next Scala 3 release) type constraints for Scala. It also supports runtime constraints.\n Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean \"without macro/black magic\"). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.\n Usage\n Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: ==>[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.\n Example: ```scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*\n inline def log(x: Double ==> Greater[0d]): Double = Math.log(x) ```\n Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: ```\n    submitted by    /u/Il_totore  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello!\n I'm fairly new to org-mode, and have just been familiarizing myself with the basics for the past few days. After going through some excellent posts, I decided to try out org-mode for taking down and organizing lecture notes, and thought I could first try it out on a MOOC that I am taking.\n Now to the real question. As someone who has always taken down notes on paper using a pen, I do not plan to move away from it, and infact would like to org-mode to supplement it. Being a grad student in Computer Science, and Engineering, I realize that apart from taking down notes on a paper, I would need to annotate PDFs, to add notes that, have blocks of code from different stages at different points in the notes.\n Thus, I may potentially have upto 5 sources of notes (yes, seems like a lot): (i) a majority on pen-paper, (ii) annotations in a PDF, (iii) normal notes and points in a normal org-mode text window, and (iv) blocks of code and (v) diagrams. Is there a good way to combine these different sources in org-mode and make it seem streamlined and efficient? Essentially, a good workflow for me to add pdf's and diagrams/code to my pen-paper notes and organize them. Is it even feasible, as I am still fairly new to org-mode?\n Breaking it to a simpler need, what is the best workflow to integrate lecture slides (with annotations) with handwritten notes? \n Note: Please don't provide answers such as \"Just listen in class don't take notes constantly, or you will miss out\", it doesn't for me. I'm someone who relies on writing a lot to understand information, and pen-paper notes has worked well for me. I would love to supplement it with other sources to make it better :)\n Edit: I have come across org-noter, and though I find it to be cool, I don't understand most of it, and it seems for a pro-org-mode user! If someone does suggest it, I'd highly appreciate it if someone explains what it does for a noob user.\n    submitted by    /u/ThreeForElvenKings  \n [link]   [comments]",

Example:\n ``` * Section one\n +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-one () \"This is not a useful function.\")\n +end_src\n  \nSection two\n  \n+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent\n (defun function-two () \"This is not a useful function, either.\")\n +end_src\n ```\n When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.\n Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I'm describing? Alternatively, is there a similar command or package that provides this sort of functionality?\n    submitted by    /u/Benthamite  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.\n Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can't say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.\n Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don't understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it. Maybe I \"solved\" a side-effect of another problem instead?\n Can anybody give me a bit of insight that will either give me confidence in my solution or help me find the real problem?\n    submitted by    /u/WitnessTheBadger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, this is a minor question but am curious. I have beorg on my iPhone 6, and every time I start it it takes a number of seconds to sync, even if nothing has changed, and then a few more seconds to “settle down” Usually I hope to quickly add a note, and then move on, so it has some slight friction for usage. Especially when I close and reopen to add another thing — same long wait though nothing has changed. Any thoughts? My org files are not particularly large.\n Cheers!

Only when used correctly can they help you actually get real work done. \n It hasn't taken me long to figure out that the only real way to \"master\" (use competently) org-mode/emacs is to just dive in, figure out what YOU want out of your management system, and go for it. \n if you find your self at a dead end, it's probably not a limitation of the system, but a limitation on your specificity of your goal / problem. \n However complex, labyrinth-ian both systems get, they will never be outpaced by other \"note taking \" apps . \n Why? \n ​\n because org-mode and emacs are both more about the processing of text than simply note-taking. \n ​\n I really think that the future of org-mode however, is to move away from some of the architectural constraints of emacs.\n    submitted by    /u/SpellLegitimate  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've also heard that rtags wouldn't work if there are many errors and that there were some problems when the irony server was up for long. I visited ycmd's repo, and it seems to now be unmaintained: abingham/emacs-ycmd: Emacs client for ycmd, the code completion system. (github.com) \n Many people said that they were interested in cquery, but most of what I found was from a few years back, so I just wanted to ask how far have these packages come? can I use a combination of them at once? are there stuff that one is better at than the rest at?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/hungry_m8  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the exercises is about detecting anagrams in a list.\n There are lots of ways to do it, but decided to try something that was less about manually iterating through the characters in a word myself and more about using built-in functionality.\n (defun anagrams-for (word anagram-list) (cl-loop for drow in anagram-list with tmp-drow = drow unless (equal (downcase word) (downcase drow)) do (setq tmp-drow drow) unless (cl-mismatch (cl-sort word '< :key 'downcase) (cl-sort drow '< :key 'downcase)) collect tmp-drow)) \n First, that with tmp-drow = drow absolutely does not work as I expect. The cl-loop is supposed to set variables in a let* manner, but when that with is called, drow is still unset. That's why I do the setq later.\n Second, cl-sort is destructive, so I thought I'd be able to copy the value into tmp-drow and avoid the rearranging of pointers that it performs.

But the performance was too bad for me, of course i don't have a state of art computer (pretty old one actually), but thats really no excuse for pure performance, by poor performance i meant ram usage, speed, processor usage etc. For example when working on a react project in typescript (tsx created by CRA), the ram usage increased up to several gb and eventually or immediate there were input lags and really slow and sluggish performance. meanwhile i found vscode very performant on same machine on same project. lsp isn't slow for any other mode, i use it frequently for go, python, c/c++, they work smoothly. Then i tried out tide in web mode, and boy it was a good change. tide works out of the box, very well, fast enough and it didn't eat up so much ram either. i am not very familiar to elisp tracebacks, so just moved on to tide, instead of going deeper. i feel somewhat guilty for that, but i just don't know where to start or where to look at, cause lsp-mode code is huge and i don't know where to begin.\n Anyway, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you find any solution? I looked into the git issues but not much luck.

I'm also looking to integrate org-roam in my workflow as soon as v2 is stable.\n We've only recently been handed work laptops, so currently I'm travelling with both laptops, which is not really convenient. As the work laptop (Windows 10) is heavily secured (no admin access, no installs of apps in user context either, lots of security-related logging and alerts, ssh client disabled), I guess that the only way to use emacs on this thing is over https (which is monitored as well, mind you). I do have experience with self-hosting some stuff on my own domain, so I'm looking for a web application I can self-host which allows me to use emacs over a web browser.\n There are many pieces of information about this, such as\n  \nshell apps: gotty, web-console, gateone, shellinabox, butterfly, webssh: most seem no longer maintained and there's no clear indication regarding conflicts with key mappings between the browser/app and emacs ;\n more specific emacs/orgmode apps: cloudmacs, organice, orgmodweb, filestash, org-web: they are more limited by nature, but I might use them if they have support for custom agenda views which I use heavily ;\n the use of chrome web app mode or spacemacs to resolve the keymapping problem.\n  \nSo, before going through each and every combination, or having to torture my muscle memory, does anybody have a thorough (and positive) experience of using emacs, or at least org-mode, in a browser on a daily basis ?\n    submitted by    /u/Born-Deranged  \n [link]   [comments]",

At 1st I just want to have a single web page, where I post a professional photo of myself with a hyperlink to my github projects. Eventually, I would like to do full blown blog posts with all kinds of stuff, like for example, if I'm applying for a particular freelance project, lets say python web scraping, I would want to create a simple python web-scraping application, push the completed project to github, then write a blog post, where I show step by step with coding blocks, how I developed and built the application from scratch. That way I can demonstrate to the client that I have the necessary skills required to complete that particular freelance gig.\n If there's any extra wordpress themes/plugins that you'd recommend for this use-case, then let me know.\n Also, I'm new to wordpress, so I'm not sure how remote wordpress development works, I would like to develop the blog using emacs on my laptop, test it to make sure that it works correctly and does not crash wordpress, then push the changes remotely to wordpress on the pi linux web server.\n Thanks in advance for the help!\n    submitted by    /u/zeta_00  \n [link]   [comments]",

Feel free to tell me if I didn't, and suggest where to ask otherwise. I am an aspiring lisp / scheme hacker. One thing that I would really get into is gnu guix, the distro which is powered by the guile programming language. \n So far, all my attempts to combine emacs and geiser whilst hacking guix have gone suboptimally. The main thing that doesn't work for me is the ability to jump to a symbol's definition using M-. or M-,. This is what I have used browsing emacs lisp code, and I feel this is instrumental to learning the language and how stuff works when you kinda know the basics, but not more than that.\n Thus, I would love to know how I would have to set guile and geiser up so that I will be able to use that most useful function.\n Maybe I am missing something super obvious here that I have not mentioned.

The bad thing is the ids are UUIDs meaning they contain no information whatsoever on what they’re actually for. This is annoying when you’re editing a link (IMHO).\n So I made something that creates human readable links. This turns out to be a bit involved, as generating UUIDs is stuck somewhere deep inside another function you really don’t want to mess with (separation of concerns apparently is not a thing in org-id code?).\n What it does is when you store a link ( C-c l) it checks whether there already is an ID property.

I started with emacs about a year ago, and have been kinda stuck in a beginner state since then. I'm a math teacher, not a programmer, and emacs is a little side hobby that I haven't spent enough time really learning, in order to reap the benefits of being able to make it do whatever I want. But this last week I put in some time, and I learned a lot, and now I have a cool thing, and I feel like I'm finally on the road to emacs wizardry.\n Here's the problem I want to solve: I have a lot of students, and there are a ton of things I want to remember about each one of them.

          "description": "Hello Everyone. I'm using Emacs everywhere - on my linux laptop and work mac laptop, and whenever I get a chance I'll use my large monitor for better screen real estate. I'm determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.\n I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I'm not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).\n I'm just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type \"darwin\"). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.\n ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (> (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-11\")) (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . \"Fira Code-14\"))) \n Then, it occurred to me that I'm not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?\n In the meantime, I'm off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won't need to ask for this kind of help in the future.

I've written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I'm okay, but I'm not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.\n What I'd like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn't depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn't come with a REPL.\n I'm currently use Octave in a literate mode and it's pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure's case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.\n Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/\n The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like\n clj -Sdeps \"{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \\\"0.11.935\\\"}}}\" \n Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.\n I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el\n It seems relatively straightforward - but I'm unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I'm okay if this only works on Linux)\n Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know.

That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. \n I'm aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. \n I'm also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don't know why it's so disliked. It's essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can't go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.\n An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. \n Am I overlooking any packages? I'm facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I've never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is.

Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.\n It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.\n The 'just as if...' is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don't happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.\n Even if it didn't, I'm not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).\n I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?\n How might I do this? Any ideas would be great.

When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. \n The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.\n It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I've kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. \n I'm curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? \n Thanks, \n -Hunter\n    submitted by    /u/EMWaveHunter  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, for some modes like geiser, I've tried specifying the obvious entry points (e.g. geiser, run-geiser, and geiser-repl) but portions of geiser are still loading and being shown in the features variable. Is there a way to determine what is causing these features to be loaded? I have tried with :defer set both to t and nil with no effect.

          "description": "I'm using emacs 26.3 in Windows 10 (I work in a Windows intensive environment, and I had to give up the struggle of using Linux). And just this morning, for no reason that I can see, the second command C-f in a command sequence fails to register. \n For example, I was editing a LaTeX file using AucTeX, which has C-x C-f C-e for entering emphasized text. But the second command key, the C-f, couldn't be entered. Emacs stopped at C-x and refused to accept another command key. \n I closed Emacs down and restarted, and entered C-x C-f to access a file, and again, the C-f wouldn't register. It's not a problem with my keyboard: the f key works fine (see this post?) and the only changes to my .emacs file have been some minor font changes for font-lock-mode. \n It seems to involve only C-f. Other sequences do work: C-x C-b for example, or C-x C-s. But C-x C-f is a sequence I use a lot, and I have no idea why it's not working. Any ideas?

          "description": "I'd like to hear about the layouts you've selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.\n Background, for normal, sane people who don't know what I'm talking about:\n One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.\n These keyboards make heavy use of 'layers' - additional custom 'modifier' keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..\n For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as \"home row modifiers\". Typically you'd make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.\n But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I'm interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they've settled on.\n I'm playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a 'game' in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I'm thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.\n    submitted by    /u/Private_Frazer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now when you press arrow left the marker goes to the left as if the space is filled with spaces.

For instance, I can do a vertical split in workspace 1, than move to workspace 2 which will be a new empty frame, not vertically splitted. Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn't manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I'm currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window. Why you don't just use EXWM, you might ask. Because for now I'm quite skeptical about its usefulness for me, so I want to take my time to understand if it's something that might actually improve my workflow.

I thought a way for me to get into using emacs would be learning a new language, and looked into C++. I found this great guide for using C++ with emacs, but frankly I'm a bit intimidated by how many extensions and how much configuration are required. It makes me want to just use a more standard IDE.\n I guess I have two questions for more experienced users: 1. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is coding with emacs at odds with using an IDE, and I should be looking at a different work flow entirely, rather than forcing emacs to have ide like features? 2.

In these cases, they seem to expect you to manually delete white space in front of the line to un-indent. Also, working all of these different indent functions into my existing keybinds is annoying.\n I have a package (github) that detects the indentation offset and updates the tab-width variable in emacs. Does anyone have a package/function that can use this variable to indent/dedent single or multiple lines?\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/oregano5544  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello there,\n https://github.com/overdr0ne/gumshoe\n What is it?\n Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder. It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil's jump list, but works more generically.\n Why?\n Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I’m getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim’s jump list which, in Evil’s implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn’t work when you’re not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I'd share.\n Does anyone do anything similar?

I just started using Emacs and have a noob question:\n How to configure Emacs to automatically close brackets like in VS code or other text editors?\n I switched from Vim to the latest version of Doom Emacs and didn't like the behavior of auto-closing brackets. Specifically, I don't like two things:\n - Auto erasing closing bracket('|' -> cursor):\n ```c++ int main() { {| } ``` becomes: ```c++ int main() { | ``` \n  \nNo new line with indentation after pressing Shift+Enter:\n c++ int main() { { |} } \n Just Enter:\n c++ int main() { { | } } \n \n I tried several solutions from the internet, but neither of them worked as I wanted(I also tried hacking on them, but it was really hard because I am a noob in Elisp and Emacs). My requirements are not that high, though: - Add a closing bracket - Add new line and indent after I press Enter (and Shift+Enter) - Don't remove the closing bracket when I erase the opening one (I usually start erasing from the closing bracket and when I reach opening one, it removes the next closing bracket)\n In vim, I used simple bindings:\n ``` \" brackets\n inoremap \" \"\"<left> inoremap ' ''<left> inoremap ( ()<left> inoremap [ []<left> inoremap { {}<left> inoremap {<CR> {<CR>}<ESC>O inoremap {;<CR> {<CR>};<ESC>O \n ```\n I tried to implement it in Emacs but couldn't. Will appreciate some help.\n Is there a good way for auto closing brackets in Emacs?\n EDIT: I think electric pair suits me. As for me, smartparens' behavior is really annoying: it deletes closing pair and acts strange. I figured out how to turn off it in Doom Emacs: lisp (remove-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook #'smartparens-global-mode) (smartparens-global-mode -1) \n One thing left: I want auto indentation after pressing Shift+Enter too.\n    submitted by    /u/MisterMoral  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is an official test file, but that one is far from code coverage and I had since tried to find the best way to create my own files. These are some examples (ignore .bin files).\n I tried to use hexdump and some other GUI tool which were not very useful imo. The best luck I had was with a custom c++ code but the issue I had was that code is since broken, besides its not the best idea to rewrite source .txt and forget to update the .bin. Which led me to writing my own elisp file editor.\n A binary file would look like this:\n 0a 00 00 01 00 00 11 00 ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | end of vector | | byte data | following data will be a byte vector // Those 00 00 are lengths of names of vector and byte // but i removed the names to make it fit on the line // More details in the NBT specs. \n The above would be diplayed like this:\n 0a 0000 01 0000 11 00 \n Or like this: ([%] means vector, b means byte)\n [%] \"\" { b \"\" 0x11 } \n Or:\n [%] \"\" { b \"\" 17 } \n So it should be at least hexadecimal, indented and separated into lines, but I would also add some readability.\n Optional: While editing the file I would like to safeguard myself and do checks on the data that I insert. Maybe even a separate buffer like in calc for stack and trail, but for insert/edit and view.\n    submitted by    /u/max_ishere  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings Emacsians! I, emacs noob, am back with additional questions. I am configuring emacs to be my personal calendar and task management system. I really like the \"M-x org-agenda a\"\n view's information, but I don't like its formatting.\n First and foremost, long lines look terrible. I have \"word wrap visual line mode\" activated, which wraps lines in all org files. I also have the \"adaptive-wrap\" packaged installed and active, and that makes the text wrapping in normal org mode files look much better since indenting is respected. However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. \n Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like \"adaptive-wrap\" does for ordinary org mode files?)\n Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I'd like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).\n (1) Since the todo's are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the \"todo\" keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?\n (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?\n    submitted by    /u/the88doctor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Reading Christian Tietze's and Sascha Fast's blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.\nI figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain's presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.\nI decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.\nFrom looking at his setup, I'd have to track the following:\nTotal from a year\nTotal from the first to the fourth quarters\nMonthly average\nWeekly average\nNumber of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it\nDaily average\nNumber of days in which I get my daily average or above it\nHe tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.\nMy problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn't talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?\nReally appreciate any help you can give me.",

Greetings!\nI have kept a paper zettelkasten for the past six months or so, which has benefitted from everyone's discourse and guidance here. So, thank you all! I hope to contribute a meager offering now and then to this already robust discussion forum.\nRelated to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.\nThe subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It's true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that's probably why I chose a paper system.\nI also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I'd like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.\nAnyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone's expertise!

I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.\nI did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  \"What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?\".\nI think that I understand, from what I've read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.\nThe basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" resonates with me.  I'm just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.

E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:\nSome description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].\n2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].\n3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].\n4. do b [citekey2].\n\nYou do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].\n\nI ask:\nIf I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?\nIn general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don't question what I do like in the scenario described?\nI appreciate your comments in advance.",

The problem is I have both physical and digital notes, which are not integrated. \nAlso I think I’ve been doing it wrong the whole time since I only noted excerpts basically.\nI was wondering how to fix it.\nShould I divide literature and permanent notes?\nThank you for your time",

          "description": "Super glad to be part of this community of top-level researchers! Hope to become as good as you soon.\nI have a couple of questions, however;\nI don't want to start with a digital zettelkasten, so I've started the process of acquiring a novelink box and index cards from Amazon. But info online is considerably vague. I know I'm to use my fleeting notes for quick ideas or notes as they come, then my literature note is for learning purposes before transferring to my permanent note, then finally transfer singular ideas into my zettels. My question is how do I use this while reading a book or taking an online course? What do I need to transfer between these notes? How do I know I'm taking the ideal note? Do I look at it from the context of why I'm studying the note/book/course, or I'm to maintain an open mind?\nAlso, I don't know if there are copywriters in this group, but how can I use this method to boost my research ability? How do you use your zettelkasten system to research?\nThanks for your answers!",

          "description": "Not strictly a Zettelkasten, but almost. I was ready \"How to write mathematics\" by P. R. Halmos. and on page 134, he discusses how he organizes a book or long article:\n\n  \nAt one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it's mentioned.\n\n\nEmphasis mine.\nIt is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.",

          "description": "Can I, as an historian, use a Zettelkasten for my research?  For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn't seem to fit the Zettelkasten 'method' described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.\nThe first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…",
