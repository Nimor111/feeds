Enforce property with refined types\n Encode the precondition as a guard\n  move :: [Walker] -> [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws = ... move _ = error \"All walkers must be at the same position\".

That solution is interesting, because illegal states are now unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that the input is a walker.\n Enforce property with refined types\n I could use Liquid Haskell to check the precondition using a SAT solver.

Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?\n Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that's part of the answer that I'm seeking?\n    submitted by    /u/Suitable_Use_2730  \n [link]   [comments]",

My code can be found here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/tree/context-bindings\n This is the first time I use FFI and I have not come very far. I can query the version of the library and do some calls to rrd_*_error which run but return empty results. So I'm not even sure I am missing something very basic here.\n This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:\n $ cabal test --test-show-details=always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL \n Started in a repl I get the following:\n ghci> :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci> rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). \n The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.\n Can someone help on what to do next?\n EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.\n This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.\n So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.\n    submitted by    /u/thomasbach  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There's a bad dynamic in America's STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they've never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some \"learn to code.\" And so I've been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I'm basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I'm high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I'm all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it's basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I've come across so far has hardly ever been more than \"learn to code,\" typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I'm so alone on this is ominous. I've contacted lots of big name professors -- and they're sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they're awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah....

I come from a math background so I thought it'd be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like <> for example which represents an associative operation. What I'd really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?\n    submitted by    /u/No_News_3567  \n [link]   [comments]",

I then tried with a \"main = do\" and writing under it but nothing works as in the tutorial, example \"sumOfNums = [1..1000]\" among many others.\n What can I do if I want to just play around, test basic functions etc in a browser ? It seems that I am supposed to already know some level of coding architecture and in every basic tutorial I watched there isn't any mention of such main = ...\n It's puzzling me how incredibly complicated this simple beginner step seems to be when comparing to, say, groovy web console, in which you can just type things, functions, classes etc...\n Thanks guys !\n    submitted by    /u/JustAd2122  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've encountered a design issue several times, and I'm wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.\n I'm implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -> Z a or b -> Z a -> Z a. But for a few of the functions there's no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). \n Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with >>= \n z :: Z a z >>= op1 >>= op2 >>= (op3 x) >>= (op4 1 2) \n or something like\n pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => a -> t (a -> m a) -> m a pipe = foldM (&) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] \n This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -> Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe'd functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.\n My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. \n I hope my question is clear.

If you're interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:\n ​\n Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen\n ​\n  \nIn this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.\n  \nMake your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez\n ​\n  \nWe'll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We'll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we'll discover why our language can't really be represented by a tree after all.\n  \n​\n We'll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.\n The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.\n Please RSVP here if you're interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717.

Secondly, I understand something like let x = 5 in something, where the compiler looks for x in something and replaces it with 5.

          "description": "Hello, I've been studying definitional interpreters written in Haskell as part of a programming languages course. We talked about writing in monadic style as an elegant way to implement non-determinism or exceptions or precise evaluation order. This got me wondering, is there a way to design an applicative interpreter which uses applicative functors as its interface?\n If this is possible, I could imagine a new design space. Since every monad gives rise to an applicative, there would be a broad range of applicatives to consider. Applicatives are also simpler to reason with, which could make the resulting languages more accessible for proofs.\n So far, I'm not sure that this is possible. Local 'let' definitions and lambda abstractions seem to require the full power of monads.\n    submitted by    /u/kn2322  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.\n What's new in v4:\n  \nlocal database encryption with passphrase. It's using SQLCipher as a replacement of SQLite, via our forks of direct-sqlite/sqlite-simple, it worked very well on all platforms - iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, we only didn't manage to compile encryption for Windows yet.\n improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.\n you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.\n German language in the interface.\n  \nSee full release announcement for more details.\n Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.\n Please ask any questions\n You comments, questions and criticism here are very welcome - I will try to answer all the questions!\n Also, we are hosting the event on Discord on October 6, at 6pm UK / 10am PT - please join via this link to:\n  \nlearn how SimpleX Chat is different and why it provides better meta-data privacy than alternatives,\n hear about future platform development plans,\n ask any questions,\n criticize what we do,\n suggest improvements.\n  \nOnce you install the app you can choose \"Connect to developers\" to ask any questions, suggest new features and to join the group of users.\n About SimpleX Platform\n Some links to answer the most common questions:\n How can SimpleX deliver messages without user identifiers.\n What are the risks to have identifiers assigned to the users.\n Technical details and limitations.\n How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc..\n    submitted by    /u/epoberezkin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The utility of uniqueness typing - as evidenced by it being separately adopted by Clean and Mercury, as well as having echoes in Rust - is straightforward: it enforces a typing discipline that ensures values only have a single reference. (or none, in the case of Rust) Hence, using them to model side-effecting sequential code is straightforward, as destructive update and imperative control in uniquely-typed code can't pollute what's outside.\n Linear types are more elegant and intuitive from an abstract perspective, but weaken that guarantee : a linear arrow in Haskell can mint a linear value out of an immutable \"plain\" value with multiple references. Hence, although no more references may be added once it's been created, in-place destructive update isn't guaranteed to be safe.\n All is not lost, though: as linear types can only be used once anyways, it would, for practical purposes, suffice to show that they are eventually unique - that, by the time of their use/destruction, they only have a single reference. One could also consider a sequence of linear arrow applications, such that it converges to uniqueness in the given reference to which they were applied.\n Are there meaningful assumptions which strengthen linearity to uniqueness without dropping the theoretical cleanness? (like wrapping them in an opaque monad)\n    submitted by    /u/talismanick_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had to use the codium command to open VS Codium from the terminal.

I'm not a seasoned user and lack experience with the build tools, but seem to encounter these build issues more often than I would like to. For example I currently have this error. Ok, so one transitive dependency (diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3) that will not compile because of variable not in scope. I then try to lower the version bounds for dependencies that depend on diagrams-lib-1.4.5.3 in hopes that a lower version will not have this same issue:\n Chart >=1.8 && <1.10 , Chart-diagrams >=1.8 && <1.10 \n To:\n Chart >=1.7.0 && <1.8 , Chart-diagrams >=1.7.0 && <1.8 \n This causes another compilation error which I don't understand, as I have already tried various version bounds. So now I don't have any ideas left.\n Why would transitive dependency not compile, shouldn't this be solved by the dependency that uses it before being uploaded as a library for general usage?\n    submitted by    /u/Hxfhjkl  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now if your other project doesn't use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.\n If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn't contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it's suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.\n    submitted by    /u/EloZash  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not new to the JVM; I've done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I'll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I'd feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I've also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We're a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I'm looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I'm not opposed to pragmatism either; it's one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there's a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem.

E.g., let's imagine this tree structure is my app:\n - app: my app - scheduler: should wake up every quarter hour (0m, 15m, 30m, 45m) and perform a task - my_svc_pool: connection pool to a service that is called from within the scheduled task - my_svc: connection to my service - my_svc: another connection to my service \n So let's say scheduler wakes up, tries to run its task by calling out to my_svc_pool, but the particular connection that it got routed to in the pool happened to get disconnected right before that. So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.\n How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:\n  \nIf a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it\n If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one\n  \n   submitted by    /u/yawaramin  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is similar and what is different? \n Some context: \n I've been on a programming language exploration journey for the last year or so and I'm trying to learn as many FP languages as I can. I've looked into Haskell, the various Lisps/Schemes, F#, Ocaml, Elm, Rust, etc.... Racket (a Scheme) and the ML-based languages (F#, Ocaml) have been my favorites so far, though they're also not without their weaknesses. Racket and OCaml are both fantastic languages (I found myself favoring the latter due to the type system), but kinda suffer from having a relatively small ecosystem -- and in the case of Ocaml, rather poor tooling. F# offers a much better ecosystem, and in fact it's the language I've used the most (I love ADTs). There's also something very elegant about the ML syntax, even though F# lacks some of the more interesting features of OCaml. One non-trivial weakness of F#, imo, is that eventually you're going to have to resort to some (or sometimes a lot) non-FP/OOP code due to its ties with the C# and the .NET environment. And that can be a drag.\n I've also tried a little Clojure, and it's a nice enough language (happy not to have to deal with Java), though I can't say that I'm in love with it. Overall, it just seems like a less elegant Scheme, and I don't see much of a reason to use it over something like Racket/Scheme, except for maybe the larger collection of libraries that are available on the JVM (OK, the hot reloading feature is also neat, but not something I necessarily care about).\n    submitted by    /u/jmhimara  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything run through LoggingAdapter was processed into a String, so you couldn't represent data in two different formats depending on the appender -- in Echopraxia, argument serialization is deferred, so you can have logfmt on console and JSON on the backend. \n This also means you don't have to rely on MDC or the built-in toString methods in Akka any more. Probably the biggest relief is being able to map ByteString to {length=11 utf8String=some string} so it has binary/text data available.\n Your domain messages in Akka can be handled using automatic derivation, and logging is type safe -- if there's no ToValue mapping, the logging statement just won't compile.\n Hope you like it!\n (Comments about Akka's business license / future are not welcome, please keep it on topic.)\n    submitted by    /u/amazedballer  \n [link]   [comments]",

The libraries are increasingly stable and we're having as much fun working with them as on them these days. 😊\n Indigo 0.14.0\n This release includes many improvements, fixes, and enhancements, but the exciting new feature is timeline animations!\n Even simple animations for title screens used to be very difficult in Indigo, but they now have a dedicated and rather fun solution.\n Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.14.0\n (As a bonus, the Roguelike-starterkit has also had a tiny update to keep it inline with Indigo.)\n Tyrian 0.6.0\n Version 0.5.0 rebuilt Tyrian to run on Cats Effect 3 and fs2 from the ground up, but you were locked into using IO, and you couldn't use fs2 directly in your web apps. This release adds...\n  \nThe ability to use fs2 Streams for subscriptions\n Support for ZIO 2.0*\n  \nWe've also added a swathe of other quality-of-life improvements.\n Release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.6.0\n (\\ You'll need to use a snapshot of the interop-cats library until the next release, but it works just fine. See the release notes.)*\n Getting Started\n You can get started with either project with their g8 templates:\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8\n https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8\n ...or by heading over to the awesome: https://scribble.ninja/\n Documentation can be found at https://indigoengine.io/ and https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/.\n As always, please report any issues, and if you need any help, do come and say hello on Discord.\n https://discord.gg/b5CD47g\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

My goal for this project is to make \"CSS in PureScript\" more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing\n If you're interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall's CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library's CSS coverage.\n From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a <length-percentage> value where a <length> was expected (although those cases are covered too).\n Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.\n I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/nsaunders1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n I've just started using Org and I am fascinated by it and the possibilities it offers over every other system I've ever tried. I've started tinkering with custom agenda views, and I've got this fairly basic custom view happening with the following code:\n  (setq org-agenda-files '(\"~/Documents/projects\")) (setq org-agenda-custom-commands '((\"p\" \"Programming todos\" ((tags \"programming\"))))) \n Now, I have a number of projects in that projects directory whose top-level headline is marked with the WAIT TODO keyword, but whose children are marked with regular TODO. My logic here is that I want to mark an entire project as waiting or blocked without having to mark every subtree or subtask as waiting, too.\n The problem is, when I use my custom agenda view, the project headline appears (albeit greyed-out), and all its children appear. Is there a way to exclude an entire tree from appearing in a custom agenda view if its headline or one of its parents is marked with a certain keyword, in this case, WAIT?\n Thanks in advance for any help!\n    submitted by    /u/the_plonkmaster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Something I'm kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don't need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.\n ​\n I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each \"thing\", which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.\n ​\n Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you've got so much going on. From experience, no todo list/notes manager has ever really worked that well for this for me.... a few were okay (todoist on the todo list side and evernote on the notes side.... but they both had their own issues)\n ​\n I like org and org-roam I'm just struggling with how best to setup a structure that fits such a lifestyle.\n Any thoughts or input is very welcome...\n    submitted by    /u/Neat_Objective  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, \"it's alright, you're organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don't have to hold it all in your mind.\"\n Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I'd tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I'd been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using 'C-c a a' more throughout the day.\n I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain \"gee, that's neat\" quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.\n I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?\n    submitted by    /u/kregerator  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thank you all for your help\n Edit: I've found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k.

          "description": "Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I'd like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what's entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. \n Currently, I'm having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I've written about, but org-roam-node-find won't let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I'd instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.\n My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory \"REDACTED\") (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates '((\"d\" \"default\" plain \"%?\" :if-new (file+head \"${title}.org\" \"#+title: ${title}\\n#+date: %U\\n\") :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)) \n    submitted by    /u/Tristan401  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use org-mode for taking notes, mostly math and physics these days, typing LaTeX equations inside org files. For this I use doom emacs.\n I've seen that with markup markers such as \"*\" (bold) and \"/\" (italics), org-hide-emphasis-markers allows for showing the effect in the text while getting rid of the cumbersome markers. Moreover, when the point is within markers, they show so one can edit them.\n I was wondering if it is possible to do the same with LaTeX environments like \"\\begin{equation}\" and \"\\end{equation}\", for instance. I've tried with hide-lines.el, which allows for hiding lines matching a regex (in this case, the regex are, for instance: \"^\\\\begin{[a-z]*}\"). But although this works, it is far from ideal, as one would need to toggle their visibility for editing them, unlike the more practical way that org-emphasis-hide-markers allows for.\n Is there a way to achieve such result? Thanks in advance for all your help.\n Edit:\n To be clear, I would like to enter something like:\n \\begin{equation}\n A = B\n \\end{equation}\n and have emacs hide the first and third lines when away from the region, so that only\n A = B\n shows. If possible, I would also like to be able to see the delimiters whenever the point visits the A = B line.\n    submitted by    /u/Gus_Gustavsohn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n I have recently started taking denote notes in org format, using code snippets where appropriate. \n Ever since I started considering to build a personal blog out of these notes using lazyblorg, the capacity to export an org file to html has risen in importance. This was also the context in which I realized an org-babel/source block behaviour that I don't understand.\n Frequently, when I want to quickly test how a note looks in html, I run into the error \"unmatched bracket or quote\" which aborts the html export.\n Now, I've started to narrow the initial problem down to a few problematic aspects: apparently, org-babel tries to match \"<>\" and \"' '\", both of which I generally used. However, since the lisp-babel-block doesn't use any of those signs as delimiters, why can't I use them? \n Find below a block of things that I'd like to, but can't, use:\n #+BEGIN_SRC lisp (defvar *my-list* '(a b c)) ; This doesn't work because of ' (second *my-list*) ;; => b ; This doesn't work because of > (mapcar #'list *my-list*) ; This doesn't work because of ' #+END_SRC \n Now that I think of it, I also can't use either of these in regular text, which is pretty annoying. I would like to be able to use #' since it is something I'd want to explain to myself using a note.\n Is there a way that I can modify this behaviour?\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really would like to keep the json highlighting that org-mode provides. \n If I were doing it in bash I might create the file as bash cat > /tmp/args.json <<HERE { \"JSON_HERE\": \"Here is some JSON\" } HERE \n The python script will be written from a template and expects input from a file. If invoked at the command line, the command is python library/my\\_test.py /tmp/args.json\n For the JSON part, I have JSON set up as an org-mode language language and that provides syntax highlighting and pop-out editing, but of course there is nothing to execute. An example block would almost do it, but there is no simple way to save that to a file AFAIK\n For the python part, there is lots of information in the manual as to how to pass in various elisp list, tables, properties etc but all I need is a simple file name. Any ideas how to do that without changing my code?\n Apologies if these are dumb questions.\n Cheers \n Steven.\n    submitted by    /u/zyzygystevieray  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.\n ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being \"wrapped\" such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I'm looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?\n 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it's just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this \"pain\".\n 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I'm typing this, I'm thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.\n Looking fwd to getting schooled.

And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.\n I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)\n Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.\n Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.\n Thank you :)\n    submitted by    /u/Zestyclose-Painter-3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to set Org's org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I'm already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I'm struggling to make it work. In particular, I'm trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I'm utterly clueless because I just haven't had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.\n Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode?

I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac's NextStep/Cocoa framework.\n Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.\n ​\n UPDATE:\n  \nif you're interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!\n If you're interested in the xwidget patches I'm working on, I've created this fork of the emacs mirror.

The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.\n Anyway, this build use a new \"trampolines\" target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.\n Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.\n TIA for bug reports & feedback!\n PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn't on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)\n  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) \n This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don't use the above snippet).\n Edit: un-mangled the code block\n    submitted by    /u/mplscorwin  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is because it’s often hard to know whether the word or symbol I’m searching for is a substring of the word or symbol (especially in a coding environment).\n I’m especially wanting this functionality for completions for dabbrev and lisp symbols.

For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.\n But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don't necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #'<command> candidates))\n I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command.

          "description": "TL;DR: I need to specify a :files value inside the use-package form, but this has irritating side-effects.\n I install packages with straight and use-package.\n I use the transient package. I noticed that its info manual didn't appear for me with C-h i. I dug deeper and realized that .../straight/build/transient didn't contain a dir file or any of the doc files. Several other packages, like orderless, did include dir in their straight/build directories, but their repo directories also happen to store the doc files at the top level.\n transient is different in that its repo has a docs/ subdirectory, which seemed to be the source of the problem. But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.\n I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding\n :straight (:files (:defaults \"docs/*\")) \n to my (use-package 'transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:\n  \nstraight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs\n I get a warning \"Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for \"transient\" (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults \"docs/*\"))\"\n  \nThe first issue is annoying, but isn't a showstopper. I don't restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.\n The second issue worries me, because I don't know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package 'transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?\n I don't know why the transient docs aren't getting installed \"out of the box\" as they apparently are for everyone else.

OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.\n Edit:\n Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. \n My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.\n    submitted by    /u/Magicaldave918  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately due to work stuff, I've been using VSCode (not gonna get into details with this)\n Everywhere I edit text, I'd use the Vim keymap, it is already an extension of my mind in some way and I feel crampled when working without it.\n Lately, I've started building my Emacs config from scratch, to abstract myself from the computer I'm using and start gravitating towards using Emacs more as an OS rather than a code editor.\n I've been avoiding to use evil-mode and friends for two reasons:\n  \nI'd need to configure all the unimaginable keybindings to work properly with other packages (I'm aware of evil-collection though)\n I feel like the Emacs keybindings are designed like that in some way and that the part of the community that doesn't use evil works in the same level of efficiency or better due to tighter integration between packages.\n  \nMy question would be: \n Is it worth the effort I'm taking to learn the Emacs keybindings, or is it just \"a different way of doing the same things\"?\n    submitted by    /u/nSeagull  \n [link]   [comments]",

The following approach looks better:\n (let ((l2 '((\"vl\" \"visual lines\" visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () \"docstring\" [:pad-keys t [\"Appearance\" l2]])) \n But it fails with \"Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2\"\n My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.\n Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded?

That bothered me. After the chat I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn’t find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: “what the heck am I doing?”. Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles.

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n Lately, I've been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there's a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don't use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I'm trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I've set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn't contain an entry for elisp).\n So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I'm working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I'm working on other projects. I've thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can't put that into dir-locals reliably.\n Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there's no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there's no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it's hard to debug what's overriding mine.\n TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people's configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el\n    submitted by    /u/andreyorst  \n [link]   [comments]",

Especially in math and tabular environments. Has someone come across anything like that?\n My reasons. Sometimes I need to move things around, align, or split to have a clearer structure. AUCTeX does not seem to respond well for that kind of manual writing and neglect all the work after hitting TAB or ENTER.\n I used to work with Atom, in which idea about indentation was very simple: when I decided to move cursor two extra tabs to the right, all following lines would hold on that indentation until I'd changed it. This helped me to structure long equations to see them better.\n I hope whatever I wrote make sense.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/FranekW  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+).

I was on version 1.5.5, and I've ended up on 1.8.9.\n This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I've managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .\n But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:\n (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf\" date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format \"wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s\" infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format \"~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s\" outfile) ) )) \n Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.\n My questions are:\n  \nIs there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?\n \nI've tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?\n \n EDIT:\n Just found this warning in the documentation:\n The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. \n which explains the instability. Didn't see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M-<down> and M-<up> can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I'm facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I'm trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M-<up> and M-<down>, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying \"Text is read only\", which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great.

When you search a page in Dynalist, you get search results in the context of each parent line (\"parent\" as determined by indentation level). The same goal is accomplished in ogrep.\n Is this type of search possible in emacs? In org-mode, I know there is sparse-tree, but it is not as \"sparse\" as ogrep or Dynalist, giving much more context than I sometimes need.

I do:  ./configure --with-ns make make install sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine nextstep/Emacs.app  and then move the app bundle to /Applications. But that's not what I'm here to talk about 😃\n When macOS switched to zsh I went through a painful transition. Before then, I had my ns-command-modifier set to meta so M-x would be cmd X for me. With bash, that was ok.\n But zsh opened new possibilities for me and it really wanted the meta on the options key rather than the command key. I honestly don't remember what the pain point was. But in any case, I remapped my emacs to be just the defaults where ns-option-modifier is set to meta and ns-command-modifier is set to super. zsh and emacs have a lot of common abilities so I wanted the key mappings to be the same in both. Rather than twist zsh to accept my unique setup I untwisted my unique emacs setup to be more normal.\n Now, I have an entire set of keys, the \"super\" keys that I've never had easy access to before.\n For example, using tabs in emacs, I can bind s-{ to tab-previous and s-} to tab-next and switch between tabs just like it was Safari. Instead of two key C-c p for Projectile, (they even suggest), one key s-p. I'm mapping s-r to projectile-rails, s-y to Yari, etc.\n It was and still is a bit painful of a transition but it is well worth it.\n    submitted by    /u/pedzsanReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it possible to somehow set the configuration so that it works only on \"own\" embedded compiler?\n So far, I have been able to work around the problem by removing mingw from the system env path, I write mainly in python and golang, but if I need it again, the problem will come back.\n    submitted by    /u/parasit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I do not like to set internal-border-with to anything other than 0, because I don't want the mode-line to not extend across the entire frame. So I've been looking for ways of adding a bit of 'padding' to my frame. \n Left and right it's straightforward: simple set the fringe to some suitable width. Top padding is less so. \n I figured I could make use of the header-line for that, and this seemed like a good start:\n (setq header-line-format \" \") \n Now, I found having a whole blank line of padding a bit much (I know...), so I tried specifying the height property in the value of header-line-format directly: \n (setq header-line-format (propertize \" \" 'face '(:height 80))) \n But that doesn't make a difference unless the height property is greater than that of header-line. \n The only way I've found to make the header-line take up less than the default line height is by messing with the height of header-line. Unfortunately, some modes make use of the header-line for displaying stuff, so I find myself having to add hooks to every mode I encounter that does make use of the header-line, e.g.\n (defun my/reset-header-line-face () (face-remap-add-relative 'header-line '(:height 180))) (add-hook 'use-package-statistics-mode-hook 'my/reset-header-line-face) \n Does anyone know or can think of a less ad-hoc solution?\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few years ago i bought an expensive guitar. I played it for maybe 2 months and one of the strings started producing some ringing. The guitar came with a 5 year warranty. I took it to the shop, they tried to fix it but failed and offered me a new one. I readily accepted the exchange.\n A few months down the line even this guitar had some issues with ringing here and there. You'd be surprised to know that they again gave me a new one.\n Now, onto my third guitar. I started getting a bit better at playing by now (I had already been playing for years but didn't practice everyday until I invested in this guitar) and started understanding some technical details about the guitar, servicing it myself and also some just non technical things. I also saw the guitar Willie Nelson plays (it literally has a gouged hole in it and honestly most people who don't know it would chuck it in garbage).\n I realized that it's a guitar, it's made of wood and in a certain sense is alive. It's not going to be perfect but it's my Guitar. I know how to make it work. I practice on it everyday and I know how to manage those little details.\n You see where I'm going with this? I moved to Emacs a month ago. Objectively, it might be the worse choice compared to my setup on VSCode but it's my editor. Sure they'd be some jank and some small errors and bugs I can't fix but I can always service it myself. I can always make it better. I'd learn with it and grow with it.\n    submitted by    /u/_analysis230_  \n [link]   [comments]",

This should play well with cooperative threading. So out of curiosity, I tried\n (make-thread (lambda () (gnus-group-get-new-news)) \"Gnus Get News\") \n Guess what -- it works! It does the work in the background without blocking emacs, and update the *Group* buffer once it's done.\n Surprisingly I didn't find anything similar online. I wonder have anyone experimented similiar techiques with more heavy usage? I have no idea how robust this is -- I could be very lucky with nnreddit, its source code has a bunch of with-mutex. I guess that suggests it's written with concurrency in mind? But it doesn't really use any concurrency out of the box, really puzzling...\n P.S.

You can't get lost in a park, and not so easily and dangerously in the bright Italian wood; but in the German jungle, within four, five minutes, you can go missing.

Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.\n\r\n                   \nRead the full story here",

The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.\nSome screen shots...\n\n\n\nThe interface as you noticed is commandline driven & features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print & Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size & would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I'm not much interested in that domain.

          "description": "In \"On Intellectual Craftsmanship\" (1952), C. Wright Mills talks about his methods for note taking, thinking, and analysis in what he calls \"sociological imagination\". This is a sociologists' framing of their own research and analysis practice and thus bears a sociological related name. While he talks more about the thinking, outlining, and writing process rather than the mechanical portion of how he takes notes or what he uses, he's extending significantly on the ideas and methods that Sönke Ahrens describes in How to Take Smart Notes (2017), though obviously he's doing it 65 years earlier. It would seem obvious that the specific methods (using either files, note cards, notebooks, etc.) were a bit more commonplace for his time and context, so he spent more of his time on the finer and tou…",

          "description": "Today my Zettelkasten is 6 month old. When I started note-taking in March 2022, I didn‘t expect a number of nearly 1000 notes in such a short time.\nIt was not easy to learn how put things away slowly, so that I‘ll be ready quickly when needed. Investing time now for time later. It means changing my personal workflow I‘ve trained over years.\nAnd I‘m happy with the results. In the „Project Notes“ section of my Zettelkasten I now can find 73 smart sketchnotes I’ve already published here on LinkedIn, on Twitter or Instagram.\nWhen did you start with your Zettelkasten? What‘s your learning experience?\np.s.\nTree map with PowerBI. Data from Obsidian with Dataview plugin.",

          "description": "I've stumbled upon this post by Jim Nielsen:\nhttps://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/markdown-sans-front-matter/\nIt describes how he went from Markdown files with metadata as YAML frontmatter:\n---\ntitle: My Blog Post\ntags:\n  - html\n  - css\n---\n\nStart my blog post here.\n\n... to just Markdown:\n#html #css\n\n# My Blog Post\n\nStart my blog post here.\n\nJim's trick is to put the \"slug\" (i.e. the unique identifier that determines the URL of the published piece, which in the case of example.com/posts/my-amazing-post/ is the my-amazing-post part) into the filename. His filenames are of the format <YYYY-MM-DD>-<url-slug>.md, so starting with an ISO date, then the URL \"path\".\nMaking blogging simpler this way reminds me of how the way Sascha's and my Zettel format changed over the years, and how Sascha's very minimal solution eventually came about and sticks around since then:\n# <ID> <TITLE>\n<tags>\n\n<content>\n\nVery similar approach: make it pleasant for the human, let the app do the work. Avoid ceremony and technobabble.\nI'd argue that Jim Nielsen's approach of putting hashtags before the title can worsen interoperability with applications that treat the first line of a file as the title -- but while that behavior is popular in a niche of plain text note-taking apps, it never really became a mainstream expectation, so 🤷‍♂️",
