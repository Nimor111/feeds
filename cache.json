I wrote about the changes to our code that this required in “Upgrading from GHC 8.10 to GHC 9.6 – an experience report”. That article touches on the risks associated with being forced to make many changes at once: if a problem occurs it can be hard to diagnose and it can be hard to fix.

If you are familiar with Haskell, you may have an easier time learning the Nix language, but it is still difficult to figure out the various toolchains and libraries functions needed to put your knowledge of the Nix language to use. There are some frameworks for setting up Haskell projects with Nix, but again, they are hard to understand because of their large feature scopes.

          "description": "So I watched this Tsoding Video on JSON parsing in Haskell. I have studied that video over and over trying to understand why exactly is a certain abstraction he uses so useful and refactorable. Implementing interfaces/typeclasses for some types for certain transformations to be applicable on those types and then getting these other auto-derived transformations for the type so seamlessly is mind-blowing. And then the main recipe is this whole abstraction for the parser itself which is wrapped in generic parser type that as I understand allows for seamless composition and maybe... better semantic meaning or something?\n Now the problem is though I understand at least some of the design abstractions for this specific problem (and still learning functions like *> and <* which still trip me), I dont get how to scale this skill to spot these clever abstractions in other problems and especially how to use typeclasses. Is the average Haskeller expected to understand this stuff easily and implement from scratch on his own or do they just follow these design principles put in place by legendary white paper author programmers without giving much thought? I wanna know if im just too dumb for haskell lol. And give me resources/books for learning. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Own-Artist3642  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have found a quite simple universal lambda term which does the job.\n I have documented the construction of a universal lambda term in this paper.\n It gives a short introduction to lambda calculus. Then it introduces a programming notation for lambda calculus similar to Haskell/Ocaml in order to make lambda calculus more readable for functional programmers.\n In this notation some basic functions for booleans, pairs, numbers and optional values are introduced.\n In order to encode lambda terms the usual Gödel numbering has been avoided. Instead of Gödel numbers the basic idea of algebraic data types has been used.\n Based on the structure of an encoded lambda term, a lambda term is constructed which reduces an encoded lambda term to normal form or loops infinitely in case no normal form exists.\n    submitted by    /u/hbrandl  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not only is the code longer, it's more confusing to anyone not acquainted with this specific topic. On top of that, the example showing that it automatically inserts the missing fmap seems to be trivially caught by the type checker anyway.

It offers consistent continuation-based semantics similar to those found in the eff library. For reference, see \"The effect system semantics zoo.\"\n One of its notable features is the ability to combine higher-order effects with delimited continuations, which works on a standard GHC.\n Key Features:\n  \nContinuations & Higher-Order Effects: Effects that require multi-shot delimited continuations, such as NonDet and coroutines, work seamlessly with higher-order effects.\n Purity: Built on a Freer-based system that does not rely on the IO monad, this library avoids the use of unsafePerformIO and similar functions. As a result, it can handle not only monadic but also applicative effectful programs.\n  \nFor an in-depth explanation of how this library works, check out: Higher-Order Effects Done Right: How the Heftia Extensible Effects Library Works - Sayo-hs Blog.\n    submitted by    /u/ymdfield  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has many (most?) of Haskell's features, while improving on Haskell in its handling of records/structs and namespaces, imho. That's setting aside the obvious new features like dependent types and theorem proving (I have no interest in theorem proving, personally). It also seems to have a lot of interest from corporate research groups, or at least that's what its wikipedia article claims.\n At the same time, it seems to have very little presence online, outside of its zulip chat group. I see basically nothing on reddit, almost nothing on youtube. I get the impression that very few programmers have picked it up independently or converted to it from other languages like haskell. Searching on the haskell subreddit, I see a post from two years ago where people showed a lot of interest, but not much since.\n So I'm curious, is there a reason it isn't getting traction in the developer/fp nerd communities? Does it simply have too small an ecosystem to garner attention, or is there something else?\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I tried to ask this question in a language-agnostic way here, and I'm actually using ReScript (a dialect of OCaml focused on the JavaScript ecosystem). But since the Haskell community probably has more experience with recursion schemes, I'm also asking here.\n In short, I'm writing a multi-stage compiler for a toy language, and I want to simplify folding and transforming my ASTs.\n Recursion schemes are perfect for this, but to use them I need to first \"functorialize\" my AST type, and then recover the concrete type by wrapping it into Fix. In ReScript syntax it looks like this:\n // \"Functorialized\" AST to allow recursion schemes inject custom data in place of nodes type exprF<'a> = Id(string) | Int(int) | Call(exprF<'a>, exprF<'a>) // Concrete expression type of arbitrary depth. // We add an extra wrapper to avoid defining it like 'type expr = exprF<expr>', // which would be self-referential and rejected by the compiler. type rec expr = Fix(exprF<expr>) \n The problem is, of course, that I now need to insert that Fix wrapper everywhere when constructing expressions or pattern-matching on them:\n let testData = Fix(Call( Fix(Id(\"square\")), Fix(Int(5)) ) \n Is there a way to avoid doing this, or at least automate it? Does it require specific language features, like Haskell's HKTs or OCaml's [@@unboxed]?\n I'd appreciate any thoughts!

I started learning scala a few months back using the following resources: Alvin Alexander's fp simplified 2e ( Waiting eagerly for it to be completed :( ), Functional programming in scala 2e, Scala with cats, Essential effects. While those were great books, I still don't feel confident about writing entire projects in fp scala. My end goal is to shift my algo trading system to scala, (from python) to take advantage of parallelism and spark. Are there any resources (books preferably) which teach, in a practical way, to write a server or a web api or any large project in a functional way? For beginner fper. Most of the videos on YT assume a high working knowledge of fp in scala already. I can write things in oop way in scala (tranlating code from python), however I would love to learn functional style. I know there are rockthejvm courses, but thats wayyy too expensive for me, since I'm not looking to use scala professionally, (I'm self employed) Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/psybi3nt  \n [link]   [comments]",

The effect can be safely composed with others without a separate monad!\n kyo-prelude: The kyo-prelude module contains the new kernel of the library and a collection of IO-free effects. It's a quite complete effect system with mutability only to handle stack safety, tracing, and preemption. Other than that, the entire module is pure without any side effects or IO suspensions, including the effect handling mechanism.\n System: Provides access to system properties, environment variables, and OS-related information. A convenience Parse type class is provided to parse configurations.\n Check: A new effect that provides a mechanism similar to assertions but with customizable behavior, allowing the collection of all failures (Check.runChunk), translation to the Abort effect (Check.runAbort), and discarding of any failures (Check.runDiscard).\n Effect-TS-inspired pipe: The pending type now offers pipe methods that allow chaining multiple transformations into a single pipe call.\n ScalaDocs: The majority of Kyo's public APIs now offer ScalaDocs.\n cats-effect integration: The new Cats effect provides integration with cats-effect's IO, allowing conversion of computations between the libraries in both directions.\n New Clock APIs: New convenience APIs to track deadlines and measure elapsed time.\n Barrier: An asynchronous primitive similar to Latch to coordinate the rendezvous of multiple fibers.\n Integration with directories-jvm: The Path companion object now provides methods to obtain common paths based on the directories-jvm library: Path.basePaths, Path.userPaths, Path.projectPaths.\n  \nhttps://github.com/getkyo/kyo/releases/tag/v0.12.0\n    submitted by    /u/fwbrasil  \n [link]   [comments]",

I respect people who don't like using braceless syntax but I personally love using it in Scala 3.\n My question is, Is there any scala syntax that allows you to pass multiple parameters to method calls without having to use open and close parantheses? This would be extremely useful in libraries such as the extremely practical lihaoyi's scalatags. For example. Instead of:\n  body( div( h1(id:=\"title\", \"This is a title\"), p(\"This is a big paragraph of text\")` ) ) \n If there is some syntax which denotes the indented lines are parameters, maybe something like\n  body ~ div ~ h1(id := \"title\", \"This is a title\") p(\"This is a big paragraph of text\") \n In this case the ~ indicates that the following indented region is a set of parameters, so we don't even have put commas after each parameter.\n I haven't thought through this completely, so there might be flaws in this approach, but till now I haven't been able to think of big issues except for ~ probably being used in some libraries already.\n    submitted by    /u/realmagadheera  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyway, I have been playing around with the clock, and the 'effort' estimates and I am considering using effort to simplify some of my lists.\n The problem is that I use exclusively `org-ql-blocks` for my agenda views, and I was unsuccessful in my attempts at filtering them using `se` and then selecting some criterias. I tried some other filters too, and I could only restrict the org-ql-blocks within agenda views when using `sc` and `st`, respectively category and tags.\n Since I know from the documentation that 'everything is supposed to work' in agenda views but not guaranteed to, I was wondering if the problem was on my side or if someone else could reproduce the error.\n When trying to restrict an org-ql-block using a regex for example, I do not get an error even if it does not work as I would expect, but when trying to apply an `effort` filter, I get the following error:\n Debugger entered--Lisp error: (args-out-of-range 0 0) get-text-property(0 effort-minutes nil) (let ((effort (get-text-property 0 'effort-minutes (org-get-at-bol 'txt)))) (funcall op (or effort (if org-agenda-sort-noeffort-is-high 32767 -1)) value)) org-agenda-compare-effort(= 30.0) (and (org-agenda-compare-effort '= 30.0)) eval((and (org-agenda-compare-effort '= 30.0)) t) (if (eval org-agenda-filter-form t) nil (org-agenda-filter-hide-line type)) \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/fred982  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was playing aroung with org-attach features lately, and stumbled upon something that looked weird to me. When using the uuid method to create attachment folders, orgmode uses the first two characters of the uuid to create a first folder, then the rest of the ID to create the actual attachment folder. It fails if using a uuid of less than 2 characters as far as I could test.\n It is not obvious to the eyes, a bit like a phishing site, I noticed it while deleting all attachments on a node, Emacs yes/no prompted me if I wanted to use recursive deletion. I was surprised because I understood that the 'uuid' method was supposed to store attachments in a flat directory structure named after the node's UUID, under the `org-attach-id-dir` directory.\n At first, I thought it was a bug (most probably in my config as always), but I could track down the process to this function in charge to generate the folder name:\n (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) \"Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.\" (and (< 2 (length id)) (format \"%s/%s\" (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2)))) \n Looking at this function, the bug theorydoes not stand as it looks very intentional on the developers part. So I am wondering why it was built like that.\n It does not impair the attachment functionalities at all, everything I tested works fine, but first I am curious, and second the way I found out about it bothers me. I wonder if multiple nodes were to share the same first two UUID characters, would they all get their attachment folders deleted by a recursive deletion meant for only one of them ? If yes, I think that would qualify as a bug with data loss on top of that.\n The docstring does not help me understand its purpose any better, so I thought I'd ask.\n    submitted by    /u/fred982  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I’m trying to use Org Mode in a way that’s similar to how you’d use an R Notebook or Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, I want to export the results of my analysis (including both code and images generated by that code) into a standalone HTML file.\n I’m running into two issues:\n 1. Image Embedding: By default, Org Babel’s HTML export functionality includes a link to any images rather than embedding the actual image itself as Base64. This means that if I share the HTML file, the images won’t be displayed unless the image files are also shared. 2. Pandoc Issues: I tried using a package that integrates Pandoc for exporting, but it won’t export the results of my code snippets—it only exports the code itself. This doesn’t just break image exports, it also fails to include things like text and table results from my analysis, which is a significant issue. \n Neither of these approaches works for me, and I haven’t been able to find a solution that allows for a complete, self-contained HTML file with embedded images and code results.\n My question: Is there a way to export an Org Mode file to HTML with all results (including images) embedded in the file itself? Any tips, solutions, or packages I should check out?\n Thanks in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/ScreamingPrawnBucket  \n [link]   [comments]",

It provides a simple and lightweight way to access the web from within the Emacs environment. EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen and is now maintained by the GNU Emacs project.\n One of the key features of EWW is its ability to display web pages inline, without requiring an external browser. This is achieved through the use of an HTML renderer, shr.el, which renders HTML pages directly within the Emacs buffer. EWW also supports viewing PDFs inline, using the doc-view-mode, and can be customized using the mailcap mechanism.\n EWW has several unique features that set it apart from other web browsers. It can display images inline, if Emacs was built with image support, and can block specific images completely by customizing shr-blocked-images. Additionally, EWW uses the colors declared in the HTML page, but adjusts them if needed to maintain a certain minimum contrast.\n Users can interact with EWW using a variety of commands, including eww-copy-page-url to copy the URL of the current page into the kill ring, and eww-bookmark-kill to delete bookmarks. EWW also provides a buffer for managing bookmarks, which can be accessed using M-x eww-bookmarks.\n EWW is highly customizable, with many variables and options available for tweaking its behavior. For example, the eww-history-limit variable controls the number of history entries kept, and can be set to nil to allow the history list to grow indefinitely. Additionally, users can customize image display using shr-inhibit-images and shr-blocked-images.\n Overall, Emacs EWW provides a convenient and flexible way to access the web from within Emacs, making it an attractive option for developers and power users who value the integration and customization offered by the Emacs environment.\n    submitted by    /u/epiphanicalDeduction  \n [link]   [comments]",

I originally was going to post here because I was going to ask about the differences in features/usage between org-roam and denote, but I kept thinking about it, and I feel like my overarching question should be about my notetaking strategy in general, which tools are then subordinate to.\n I have been trying GTD recently. I find the idea of the inbox to be really valuable, and I did an initial thoughtdump of every potential open loop I had in my mind. It turned out that a lot of it was less task-oriented and more introspective: things about my future, things about how I should engage with parts of the world, and so forth. The only \"next action\" I could get for these was to journal about it.\n Now, I'm attempting to determine how I should organize journal-notes like these. I think extracting parts of my introspective writing into its own note, and linking those notes together would have value to me (I don't particularly think I'd want to duplicate a full-on Zettelkasten system, but parts of it seem useful to pick up). But I don't really know. A lot of the systems I've read about are either about explicit actionability (GTD, PARA...) or about synthesizing sources and finding interesting connections (Zettelkasten).

          "description": "Hey folks!\n I just hacked together a clone of Python's instructor library and I'm looking for early feedback. That library makes using LLMs programmatically very convenient and it seems elisp would benefit from that.\n The core of what Instructor does is allow coders to define a class in Python and then to use that class to define the function-calling / JSON structured output of the LLM as well as instantiate that class based on the response of the LLM. So I tried to replicate this with defstructs as I could.\n Here's the link to the repo (obviously it's called instructor.el). It's fewer than 100 lines of code at the moment. https://github.com/Trevoke/instructor.el\n And the basic usage pattern looks like this:\n (setq llm (make-llm-ollama :chat-model \"llama3.1\")) ;; for valid types see the help for `make-llm-function-arg' and look at the type. (instructor-defstruct dnd-character (name nil :type string :description \"The character's name\") (class nil :type string :description \"The character's class\") (race nil :type string :description \"The character's race in the D&D setting\") (skills nil :type (list string) :description \"The skills the character has\")) (instructor-call :llm llm :type 'dnd-character :prompt \"Make a starter character for D&D 5th edition.\") ;; (#s(dnd-character :name \"Eilif Stonefist\" :class \"Fighter\" :race \"Human\" :skills ;; [\"Acrobatics\" \"Athletics\"])) \n    submitted by    /u/Trevoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or (next best option) a way to \"save\" my keybindings, so I can restore from a restore-point?\n For now, I guess I will have to restart emacs (again....) which is always a bummer if you have 100 open buffers and a bunch of tabs with stuff you are working on.\n    submitted by    /u/bullpup1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't structure it this way, it's something provided to me. In any event I think I have all the submodules fetched, however I'm getting a strange reaction from magit on this last one I know about.\n In this directory, at the command line if I issue git status it comes back with information about the version controlled module. It's in a detached HEAD state, but that's alright for the moment. Basically it reports just fine.\n If I am in magit, and I start at the top, and then open submodules on the way down, when I get to this submodule it says \"Corrupt Git configuration\". I find this puzzling since Git status seems to work.\n Any ideas on what is going on here? It's an awfully short error message that doesn't really let me know what the corruption is about (and there's nothing further in Messages to explain further.)\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I'm a student using i3wm on Arch Linux, and I’m struggling to decide between Neovim and Emacs as my main text editor. I really don’t have much time to keep switching between editors, so I’m looking for something I can stick with long-term.\n Here’s some context:\n  \nI type at around 150 WPM, so I want something fast and efficient.\n I’ve been using both Neovim and Emacs for about two months, and I’m comfortable with the keybindings of both.\n I like Neovim because it feels simpler and more straightforward, which is great since I’m learning a lot of new things (programming, using i3wm, etc.).\n However, Emacs is appealing because it seems to be this all-in-one tool where you can do everything from text editing to managing your entire workflow. Plus, I have to admit, using Emacs makes me feel a bit superior, like it’s a “power user” tool, which makes my decision even harder.\n  \nOne important thing: I also want to focus on building actual projects rather than spending too much time customizing my editor. Neovim feels more minimal, which might help me stay focused, but at the same time, I wonder if I’d be missing out on something Emacs offers, like Org mode for note-taking, which I’ve heard is amazing.\n Ultimately, I want to commit to one text editor for life. I don’t want to spend months switching between them or tweaking configurations. My goal is to focus on programming, taking notes, and building real projects—without getting too distracted by endlessly customizing my editor.\n So, should I stick with Neovim and its simplicity, or is it worth diving into Emacs for its extra features and potential? I’d really appreciate your advice, especially from anyone who’s been in a similar position.\n Thanks in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Wrap-4410  \n [link]   [comments]",

I implemented some enhancements that someone else kindly shared on the web.\n However, I noticed that there is no customization or command for discovering projects recursively.

(I'd rather not have to put all my other dirs under ~ into some ignore list -- that's why yadm is so nice, because it's opt-in, not opt-out.)

That's when I find out about that https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui do not work (Node.js version Node.js v20.13.1, ▲ Next.js 14.2.12) anymore.

They have identical next.config.js. I don't know how to fix it (so it build on my setup, which involves editing next.config.js and possibly the project to adapt for node20), so if someone knows please comment. I think it still build with node.js v12 because in odomanov's fork, the build 3 months ago went through and that one's using github action https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v2 which appears to use node12.\n \nhttps://github.com/odomanov/org-roam-ui have built some interesting thing called \"desk\" similar to https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-canvas 's effect. the latter uses obsidian's graph and emacs to make html, odomanov on the other hand made something like this:\n \n click on the \\\"open desk\\\" button\n will open this \\\"desk\\\" where you can have small snippet of node's html previews to drag around\n and on a side note 3. That's all there is. the only other works on org-roam-ui I'm aware of is https://github.com/ikoamu/publish-org-roam-ui (which builds on https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro 's fork) which replaces the websocket communication to emacs to get org-roam-nodes with a js stub thus made org-roam-ui static. \n    submitted by    /u/HermanHel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now I'm only covering the few languages I've been working with lately, but I'm interested in expanding the approach further so it covers multiple languages and is easy to adapt.\n A few questions:\n  \nam I re-inventing the wheel? Is there already a package that provides this feature? The only similar one I found in package-list-packages is ll-debug, which seems simple but also not actively maintained, and adding modes to it isn't super intuitive\n if no to the above questions: is this something people would be interested in?

It runs between 4-10 times faster, while maintaining total compatibility. In fact, you can enable/disable the package without any adverse effects.\n The package also extends the org-speed-commands with a hydra, accessible with the letter m. Only two commands are accesible: org-roam-refile and org-roam-extract-subtree (open an issue if you would like to see other commands).\n The only potential issue is if you use a custom template. One of the areas where org-roam spends a lot of time is formatting the template. To reduce this time the template can be a function (which is much faster than processing the template string). The template function provided in the package should be good enough for most users, but adding a new template function is easy. See code for details.\n It is a minor mode, so to enable and disable simply run org-roam-gt-mode\n https://github.com/dmgerman/org-roam-gt\n if somebody can point me to information on how to upload it to a repo of packages, I'll do that.

I discovered that, for some reason, not loading lsp-mode and related packages improves the issue.

To do that, I tried to put my config in a catch statement (to stop the execution at a certain point), like this:\n (catch 'my-exit ;; I want to execute this (throw 'my-exit \"Stop here\") ;; I don't want to execute this ) \n I'm pretty sure that what I did there is probably stupid, but I'm not an Elisp expert. Anyway, after putting all my config in the catch-throw statement (even with the throw as the last line), I couldn't reproduce the bug.\n I initially experienced the (describe-function 'pcase) bug on macOS and thought that this was in some way OS-specific, but I compiled Emacs 31+ on my Linux machine today and the same thing happens.\n At this point, I'm just very curious about what is happening.

If you prefer a clean environment, you may want to manage this manually.\n \n \n Improved synchronization mechanism for overview files, preventing multiple overview files from being created for the same source file. Also improved the robustness and stability of this feature. \n A hash table is now used to map source files to overview files. One great thing is that you don’t need to manually set the hash table file location.\n The overview file header now includes a new property block: #+SOURCE-FILE: to confirm the mapping.\n New commands: \n org-zettel-ref-check-and-repair-links - Check and repair links between source files and overview files.\n org-zettel-ref-maintenance-menu - Display a menu for org-zettel-ref-mode maintenance operations.\n org-zettel-ref-refresh-index - Manually refresh the overview index.\n org-zettel-ref-rescan-overview-files - Rescan the overview directory and update the index.\n org-zettel-ref-status - Display the current status of org-zettel-ref-mode.\n \n \n  \nCheck on Github: https://github.com/yibie/org-zettel-ref-mode\n If you like, start it!\n    submitted by    /u/yibie  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I cmd-C \"hi\" and Cmd-v it in a buffer in `term-mode` in character mode, the console just freezes up (i.e. all further keys aren't doing anything, I can't C-x b to get to another buffer, etc.). I have to Ctrl-G to get back control.\n My lossage output looks like\n ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ h i ESC [ 2 0 1 ~\n Which is what I'd generally expect with terminal shenanigans, and lossage confirms that it invokes `term--xterm-paste`. So I tried manually invoking term--xterm-paste and, yep, that freezes up the console too.\n Invoking help on term--xterm-paste doesn't give any obvious hints, and it's a compiled C function so now I'm at a bit of a dead-end. Any suggestions for how to debug this further would be much appreciated!\n ETA: confirmed issue is happening with an `emacs -Q` run and `M-x term` running /bin/bash, so I don't think it's my configuration (at least, not my emacs configuration).\n    submitted by    /u/fixermark  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been wondering why I can't use dead keys when using emacs while it works just as intended in about every other program. \n Deciding to test the issue, I started with emacs -Q, gradually adding more configuration to find the culprit -- only that I was unable to find any, because dead keys would work even with my full configuration. On the other hand, I commented out all my configuration and restarted the systemd-service, only to find that even with practically no configuration, dead keys don't work.\n I am puzzled and have no idea how to search for the solution. If you have pointers where I can look to better understand the issue or might even have a solution, I'd be grateful.\n Have a good day, fellows :)\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe it's time for another rewrite. I was brainstorming about some of the features this so-called rewrite needs: 1. Client-Server Architecture: Although Emacs has a client mode, it's not meant to use with a server on another computer. 2. GPU Acceleration: This is the new cool trend. :) 3. Safe Multithreading: While Elisp provides facilities for multithreading, they're practically useless because there is no grantee for a thread to give the process back. 4. Proper GUI Library: And better mouse support. It's also impossible to write good GUI code for Emacs due to threading issues. 5. Image-based: This is also cool. Imagine installing an Emacs distribution just by installing an image. 6. Elisp Support: We need to keep it backwards compatible.\n Please share your thoughts.

          "description": "Hi all, I have been using emacs for a few months (and loving it!), and I have recently run into some small trouble that I am not able to figure out. I was using emacs 27.1 all this which installed through apt, and needing a newer version of emacs, I recently installed emacs 29.4 through snap (and now through ppa). Some things broke, but with some time, I was able to get all my packages working again as I want them to. The main problem I am trying to solve now is this:\n Before, when I wanted to open a file or dired, I would just press 'C-x C-f' or 'C-x d' and the minibuffer would open with the path of the current buffer from where I have called the 'find file' command. Then if I wanted to navigate to some other directory, I could just press backspace and go about finding the specific file I wanted. Now, with the new emacs I have (I have tried this with snap and it's the same now with ppa), when I enter the minibuffer with 'C-x C-f' and press backspace to go to the parent directories, it no longer deletes the text and gives the message \"Text is read only.' A similar problem I faced today was with mu4e, for which the attachment directory was set to 'Downloads' folder. But I wanted to attach a file that was located in another folder, and when I tried to navigate in the minibuffer after calling the attach function 'C-c C-a', I was not able to move outside of the \"Downloads folder' and was getting the same message again. What I want is to be able to navigate through all directories in my home folder when I call these functions in any buffer. What is the problem and how do I go about solving it?\n I'd be grateful for some help with this. I don't particularly understand code, and have been using emacs mainly for humanities research, and it has worked well for me. I am on Pop OS 22.04.

I recently switched from Debian to Devuan and I was wondering if anyone has a working init script for launching this as a user, I have looked at the Emacs Wiki Daemon and while they have some examples they do not work as expected, they do start the process as my user but for some reason when I use emacsclient -c it doesn't find the socket.

Actually they didn't get drenched. They were not given the option at all and got used to not having them.\n The former is here now though having gone for years with them, they are not really missed. \n Why would folks come up with the Python based Emacs Application Framework or the Javascript based Emacs-NG if the policies had been different years ago?\n Isn't Elisp older than both languages?\n PS.

          "description": "I know that the topic of multi-threaded emacs has come up a lot in the past, with the main objection being that emacs has a ton of global state that would be impossible to make safe.\n However, I have not seen a compelling argument as to why we can't have multi-threaded garbage collection. I saw Julia has recently implemented this (relevant pr), and I struggle to see why something like this would be impossible for emacs.\n It seems that general emacs multi-threading is becoming less of an issue now, as emacs can offload a lot of workloads to asynchronous processes (LSPs, vterms, latemk, git, etc. all running asynchronously). This means that emacs is actually becoming more and more effectively multi-threaded. The downside of all this asynchronicity is that a lot of these programs communicate large amounts of data back to emacs (especially LSPs) creating a lot of garbage.\n Personally, I use gcmh-mode setting gcmh-high-cons-threshold to 10GB in order to avoid triggering the garbage collector often. Occasionally, I will get a 5-10 second freeze when GC is running on the full 10GB. I have CPU support for 20 threads, so I would imagine that multi-threaded GC would reduce the freezes to maybe 1 sec, which is a lot more reasonable.\n    submitted by    /u/omoniafan  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea is to have a mode that can transliterate Latin characters into various scripts in real-time. I'm looking to start with Arabic since that's what I'm most familiar with, but the goal is to make it extensible to other languages in the future.\n The project would use Google Input Tools for the transliteration functionality. I thought it would be a cool project that could benefit many Emacs users working with different languages. The initial requirements aren't too complex (or are they? More on that later):\n  \nIntegrate with Google Input Tools API\n Provide real-time transliteration suggestions (starting with Arabic)\n Store common translations for offline use (like a dictionary)\n Allow manual editing of stored translations\n Design the system to be extensible for other languages through config\n Share the project commented and documented\n  \nI've posted the job on (a major jobs website) and tried to make it sound as approachable as possible. I've even revised the posting a few times to make it clearer and simpler.\n But here's the kicker: I've run into two major problems. First, the developers I've hired often don't seem to properly assess the project before accepting it. I've had three instances where they've abandoned the project shortly after starting. Second, and this is on me, the budget I can offer is abysmal. I'm realizing now that Emacs Lisp is probably not a beginner-friendly language, which makes finding skilled developers even harder, especially given my budget constraints.\n I am no dev but is this project really hard? How much should it cost? And would it be interesting/worth it for the community?\n Thanks for letting me vent a bit.\n    submitted by    /u/sawtdakhili  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been working on creating a major-mode for running tests. I was inspired by how rg.el uses the header-line to customize ripgrep parameters, and I wanted to similarly use the header-line to customize test parameters.\n rg.el achieves this by propertizing header-line elements with keymaps that call functions that customize the compilation query and recompile: see rg-header.el, specifically rg-header-mouse-action. This works with their major mode, rg-mode, which is defined via define-compilation-mode. This macro wraps define-derived-mode to derive from compilation-mode. I was able to mimic this process and achieve the desired behavior for my header-line.\n The problem comes when I try to add interactivity. If what I'm running requires interaction, I typically call compilation interactively. This makes the compilation buffer use comint-mode and compilation-shell-minor-mode. I couldn't figure out how to get define-compilation-mode to be interactive, so I instead just derived directly from comint-mode and activated compilation-shell-minor-mode. With this I can get interactivity in my major mode.\n However, the left click in the header-line no longer works. The hover help text still works. I imagine what's going on is that comint-mode or some minor mode is overriding the left mouse button. How can I get around this? It seems the recommended way of overriding major/minor mode keybindings is to define your own minor mode, or use bind-key*. But I'm not sure how to apply this to my situation, where I want to apply a keybinding only to some text (in the header-line). I'd appreciate any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/treemcgee42  \n [link]   [comments]",

Normally I do software in emacs but today it's this:\n I have a list of ~ 2k-5k text chunks, that are each about one or two sentences natural language.

It reminds me of a saying: \"No matter how simple the functionality, the complexity behind it is immeasurable.\" To ensure compatibility with org-roam, I've changed the working logic of org-zettel-ref-mode from generating a new file and directly overwriting it each time to incremental updates.

As of now, I'm really happy with god-mode because of its ease of use and its complete integration with the rest of emacs.\n However, I would like to use vim-like keys to edit in text buffers and regular emacs keybinds with god-mode everywhere else, since my entire system (WM, browser, etc.) has been optimized to use vim-like keys.\n In order to achieve this, I am trying to create a minor mode that overrides keybindings in all other modes (I'm not sure this is the best idea).\n So far, I have done something like this, and the commented part has not worked (understandably).\n (use-package god-mode :straight t :config (setq god-exempt-major-modes nil) (setq god-exempt-predicates nil) (define-key global-map (kbd \"<escape>\") 'god-local-mode) (define-key god-local-mode-map (kbd \"i\") 'god-local-mode) (god-mode)) (define-key global-map (kbd \"C-x r f\") 'recentf) (define-key global-map (kbd \"C-c c\") 'org-capture) (define-key global-map (kbd \"C-c a\") 'nano-agenda) (define-minor-mode divine-mode nil :global t :group 'nano :lighter \" DiVine\" :keymap (list (cons (kbd \"C-S-h\") (kbd \"C-h\")) (cons (kbd \"C-h\") (kbd \"C-b\")) (cons (kbd \"C-j\") (kbd \"C-n\")) (cons (kbd \"C-k\") (kbd \"C-p\")) (cons (kbd \"C-l\") (kbd \"C-f\")))) \n The thing I'm looking for is the ability to do something like \"Make C-j perform whatever function C-n does in the currently active major+minor modes\".

They don't even show a key has been pressed with ctl-h k. However, chords like shift-ctl-left/right work just fine!\n Note: I access Linux via ETX remote desktop from my Macbook.\n I checked xev and Linux is seeing the keys. I also tried 29.1 (emacsformacosx.com) on my Macbook Pro M1 and it works fine. Any ideas? I'm pretty fuzzy on stuff like xmodmap.

Until very recently (last 2-3 weeks), refreshing the feeds was an operation that took maybe 1-2 minutes but it was fine because I continued to be able to use Emacs while the operation was in progress. In the last 2 weeks or so that changed: now when I refresh the feeds Emacs becomes unusable for maybe as long as 3-4 minutes. As in even receiving keyboard input for M-x commands is unreliable. \n I'm curious if anyone else has seen this behavior? And perhaps has identified a root cause? And a fix?\n Relevant info:\n - I do and have always run emacs-next from guix which currently sits at 30.6.0.\n - I run the latest elfeed and elfeed-org updated approx weekly via straight.el and then, about year ago, via elpaca.\n - I have always run elfeed with the default value for elfeed-use-curl (t).\n - My workstation is fairly beefy: 24 x i5s with lots of RAM. \n thx\n EDIT: I've recently started running the profiler during elfeed refreshes to see if it might point me in a useful direction.

I recently used them to get over a big hump.\nI was trying to learn something specific in programming. It is a huge library, and although I am a fluent programmer (having programmed everyday for the last two decades), I was resisiting this.\nWhat helped me over the hump was a combination of my Zk with Anki, a free flashcard system, which does spaced repetition. I think I now know the library I wanted to master really well: the size is what had been a hinderance and no longer seems to be. I made around 200 cards, and I know them inside out now.\nLong term, of course, it is the zettelkasten that will help me with the big picture.

The red sauce is something they’re supposed to make fresh every day; It’s one of the main fundamentals of being an Italian chef. It’s also something that can easily become the mundane if they’re not careful. It’s in the fundamentals that a dip in passion is shown in.\nI’m VERY new to building my network of notes, so I’m curious, would most people put this analogy as a separate note like “Red Sauce Analogy” or would this live in a note for the overall concept titled “When passion slips, it shows in the mundane first”?",

For instance, refer to the attached note.\n\nI am discussing two components about the nature of growth - but I typically prefer to put them in a single note only. Would it be more beneficial for me to put the subpoints in separate notes? If so, why?\nIf you guys were creating the note that I just pasted, how would you create it?

It's not far from the beach to the next big settlement. Forum Zettelkasten is written on a big sign at the entrance to the village.\nThe street is a hive of activity. The people here seem very friendly and open. Small groups have formed on many corners, chatting animatedly. I approached them to listen to some of their conversations. They noticed me and greeted me warmly.\nUnfortunately, I don't understand their language. Some words sound familiar, others are completely new to me. Now I'm standing right next to them. The word Zettel is repeated several times - the word I had already read on the big sign. I try to say it in my own language. They don't seem to understand me either.\nLuckily I always have a piece of paper and a pencil with me when I'm out and about. I draw a few lines and some symbols. The joy is great. The others also know this way of communicating with strangers.\nWhat does your journey look like? Do you have a map [1]?
