I'm using this custom GHC version that's compiled with musl libc.\n configure: error: X11/extensions/Xrandr.h (from libXrandr) is required \n Which makes sense, so I installed libXrandr from my distribution's package manager (Gentoo). But unlike the many other times I have installed XMonad on a glibc system, this time installing libXrandr did not get the error to go away.\n I additionally installed libXinerama through my package manager but the output also complained that it does not find it, but it's not required like Xrandr is so it's not a big deal.\n I run the following command as indicated by the page of the custom GHC build.\n stack install --ghc-options ' -static -optl-static -optl-pthread -fPIC' --docker --docker-image \"utdemir/ghc-musl:v25-ghc944\" --no-nix \n My stack.yaml contains the following:\n resolver: ghc-9.4.4 packages: xmonad-git xmonad-contrib-git extra-deps: 'random-1.2.1' 'X11-1.10.3' 'data-default-class-0.1.2.0' 'setlocale-1.0.0.10' 'X11-xft-0.3.4' 'utf8-string-1.0.2' 'splitmix-0.1.0.4' \n I'd imagine it has do to with GHC being a docker image but I can't be too sure.The issue is that despite installing the required dependency which would normally fix this trivial error,stack does not recognize that it has been installed.\n Please keep in mind that I'm in no way knowledgeable in anything Haskell related. Feel free to ask for any output or information.\n Any hints towards the right directions are greatly appreciated. Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/Lamampis  \n [link]   [comments]",

Given several lists ordered by priority, I want to gather unique elements from them. There needs to be at most n elements overall. For each list there is its own limit k of elements I want to take from it. Only the elements that are actually taken (so, overall unique) come towards filling the limits. I attached some test cases in a separate file in case you want to give it a shot by yourself first.\n I decided to give it a go using Haskell as it is pretty abstract and I couldn't come up with anything elegant using Python.\n The imperative version seems pretty straightforward, although I haven't programmed it.\n Here's my solution: https://gist.github.com/EgZvor/12268b0d439bd916c693c38b1fd853c8 . I can't help but think it can be simpler, so as to improve readability of a hypothetical imperative version.\n    submitted by    /u/EgZvor  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or maybe the more general type is problematic in MonadCont for some reason?\n    submitted by    /u/AndrasKovacs  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only GTK4 app I could find was ghcup-gtk a project in a very early stage.\n So I wanted to ask you if you think that there is any sense in trying to build a GTK4 app in Haskell or should I just move on and learn Rust? I’m still learning Haskell and never did any bigger project with it, but after I’ve seen the delightful world of pure functional programming the imagination of writing imperative code kind of depresses me, you know what I mean?\n Do you know any GTK4/Haskell apps?

It covers splitting test cases, input parsing, and output formatting for some common patterns so that you can focus on the algorithm as a pure function.\n I am a Haskell enthuiast who likes to use Haskell for solving coding challenges in competitive programming (like in CodeForces). Over the years, I settled on a common pattern for most solutions which I wanted to share with you all. Most of the times, my main function is just parsing the input into test cases, solving each test case, and then format the output. So, all my IO resides on a single line main program where as the actual solution is a pure function from some input type to some output type.\n Formalizing this pattern in the template, I have a solve function for input type i and output type o:\n solve :: (Parser i, Formatter o) => Splitter -> Solution i o -> IO () solve splitter solution = interact $ unlines . map (format . solution . parse) . splitter . tail . lines \n I defined 2 type classes - Parser and Formatter - to support parsing and formatting for some common input/output types. Splitter and Solution on the other hand are just type alias.\n class Parser i where parse :: [String] -> i class Formatter o where format :: o -> String type Splitter = [String] -> [[String]] type Solution i o = i -> o \n I have added few useful instances for Parser and Formatter type classes, but more can be added easily. For the Splitter on the other hand, I just created couple of common splitters - fixedSizeSpliiter when each test case has fixed number of lines and dynamicSizeSpliiter when number of lines per test case can be derived from the first line of each test case.\n Feel free to share your experiences, improvements, or suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/mihassan  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, does anyone have any information about how to call functions written in Haskell in a browser? In my experiments with C++, one can tell emscripten to keep certain functions in the wasm binary by prefixing their return type with \"EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE\". Is there a Haskell equivalent for this?\n EDIT: I think my answer I was looking for can be found here. It seems like this is how you get to keep haskell functions in the wasm binary.

Then I started to search online, finding an explanation like this. I understand the point (though not thoroughly understand everything regarding this term I suppose); however, when checking the examples on the internet, most of them use `List[A] => Option[A]`, or tap in Cats.FunctionK.

I think of them mostly as tags added to a primitive type. Like type Email = Email String (as a quick example), where we say that an Email is a special type of string.

I was thinking of using Scalatra but I read some posts and received some feedback indicating that Scala devs prefer a different stack. I remember encountering something like this in the Rust community where backends written in Rust often don't use ORMs ( but there are ORMs available).\n Despite my best efforts, I keep finding new frameworks mentioned here in Reddit that I couldn't find searching on my own. I've also noticed that a lot of articles about Scala are kind of old. How do you keep up with new libraries/frameworks? So I want to reach out to the community and ask: what kind of stack would you use as a backend?\n I am familiar with Postgresql, but it might be the case that in the Scala community there is a special DB framework (like Datomic is for Clojure). I like Functional Programming but I don't want to use monads. I settle with a simple flavor of FP(like Elixir). I've read that effects are easier to use over monads and that Scala has support for effects but I am unfamiliar with the subject.

          "description": "I was looking for a good language to implement a personal project I have (a search engine). After listening to Martin Odersky's talk \"Simply Scala\" at ScalaIO Parris 2022, I decided to give Scala a try. I practiced some Scala 3 and everything worked great. So far I really like the language. I am at the stage of selecting the libraries that I will use for the project. I wanted to implement the backend in Scala but after I stumbled with the Lift framework and after reading other posts on Full Stack Scala, I really want to give it a try. Specially since my UI is going to be simple. I was thinking of using Scalatra for the backend and maybe Lift in the front end (if the UI gets complex enough). But I noticed that both frameworks only have stable versions that are compatible with Scala 2. This article (https://medium.com/@takezoe/scalatra-now-supports-scala3-4eb8988484a7) claims that Scalatra supports Scala 3. It makes sense, since (as I understand) Scala 3 is binary compatible with Scala 2. But the Scalatra docs only covers the Scala 2 version. There are no docs for the Scala 3 version. Is this because there is no meaningful difference between the APIs of the two versions? I also read a post that mentioned that Akka did not fully support Scala 3( I tried finding it again to link it here but I couldn't find it). This gives me the impresion that Scala 3 is still not supported by most libraries.\n I have not tried to run any test projects because I still need to learn how to use sbt (I started learning Scala a couple of days ago). But I got cold feet. Before I proceed, in order to spare myself unnecessary hurdles, I would like some advice. Should I learn Scala 2 and wait until the ecosystem migrates to Scala 3? Or is it recommended to stick to Scala 3 and work around the few incompatibilities that some frameworks might have?\n    submitted by    /u/glznzuriel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like CanThrow or DbTransaction - indicating function requires special scope for evaluation - e.g. scope catching specific exceptions or scope running database transaction, committing or aborting it in the end.\n Mutable data - to keep our class Foo immutable, we can pass so-called Context containing mutable stuff - caches for example.\n Stateful objects with lifecycle - if C has close() method, we have following options: a) pass c via Foo's constructor and add close() to Foo, making it mutable b) pass c as ordinary parameter which clutters client code without much benefit c) use context function that provides implicit C in scope and closes C when it leaves the scope.\n  \nI'm calling out for other people's experience - which of those are good ideas?

          "description": "Hi,\n I use org-roam and regularly use org-attach to add clippings or even as a save location for babel file outputs (e.g., generating a diagram or figure).\n I'm also a bit naughty, and don't always keep my files entirely atomic. Such that I quite often will retrospectively org-store-link on a heading, assigning it a new ID. But when I do this, any attachments in that section now break, as the results of (org-attach-dir) now are generated from the new ID, not the file-level one. I also generally like the idea of having a single (org-attach-dir) per file; but also to have that (org-attach-dir) be based on the file ID. \n Is there a way to have (org-attach-dir) use the root/file-level ID for generating its file path? \n Thank you very much for any advice.\n ​\n Notes:\n I've looked through the archives, with some related posts found but which don't quite match my needs.\n  \nQuestion on setting up org-attach folder per file. :: I'd still like to automatically generate from ID\n How to enable org-mode to search attachment in parent header's attachment folder :: this seems to be my question! But there wasn't any satisfactory answer at the time. tag u/shelper9527 \n  \nI've tried to set the DIR property to the value of (org-attach-dir) at the root, but I don't think its possible to dynamically set properties like this? This would be ideal, as I could do this only for new files, so not breaking files that already exploit inherited IDs.\n I've tried looking into the org-attach-use-inheritance, but it seems its not designed to enforce only using the root property.\n I suppose there is some advice-add magic that could be done to (org-attach-dir)? This would be satisfactory, but less preferred as I don't like over-coupling my org notes to my specific emacs dotfiles.\n    submitted by    /u/gillash  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I'm working through a math book, I'd like to record of the exercises I solve.\n So for example, if I was working through Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, I'd like to be able to create a node/org file \"Solutions to Hartshorne.org\" with the chapter titles as headlines and in each headline I'd have environments like:\n #+begin_problem\n Give an example of an irreducible polynomial f in R[x, y], whose zero set Z(f) is not irreducible.\n #+end_problem\n #+begin_solution\n BLAH BLAH\n #+end_solution\n What I'm hoping for is a good, lightweight LaTeX package or class defining such environments that I can include in the header or setup files so that I can export my org file to PDF and get a nice solution manual. I'd prefer to be able to easily customize the solution numbering to match that of different books i.e. alphabetical, roman, numbers etc. I'd also like to handle problems with multiple parts well. I'm not too worried about the other aspects of the formatting.\n I realize this may be more of a LaTeX question, but hopefully I can get some advice here on how to set up the kind of system I want.

Then when I compile the document, the equation is going to appear with a number next to it, and if I reference \"myeq\" in the text, the reference is going to turn into hyperlink with the number of the equation.\n In contrast, the closest thing I can do in org mode, is adding a #+NAME property to the equation, and referencing it with a standard org-mode link. This translates nicely to latex links if I export it to latex, however, it is sort-of inconvenient if I look at the file in org-mode because the #NAME property disappears when I compile the latex fragments, so I can't tell which equation a given link is pointing to without following it.\n Any ideas how to solve this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/acosmicjoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

But just how significant that step up is depends on how much use I'd make of those back-links when subsequently reading my org-roam nodes. And that is hard to assess without first building up a big enough set of nodes.\n So my question is addressed to those who have made a sufficiently serious move into org-roam to have built up a decent database of nodes (and, as a result, back-links).

Anyone have any good workflow recommendations for a Google Pixel 7 running termux as well as a Raspberry Pi device on LAN?\n ​\n Asking since I'm debating if I should just use Emacs via Termux (although probably clunky) and just make note files that get ingested into a folder on LAN that later get slurped up and incorporated as new tasks under a '* Phone Notes' heading or something.\n I'm also planning to probably use Syncthing on LAN too somehow to facilitate the syncing.\n ​\n Curious for your thoughts thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BackToPlebbit69  \n [link]   [comments]",

That is intended to position point on a new line in the capture buffer, ready for me to type in whatever text I want. And it has always done exactly that. However, what I now see is that where I have a template that clocks in, AND if I am storing clock info in a drawer, then that positioning goes awry. Instead of point being positioned at the start of a new line, it is placed right on top of the clock drawer. That forces me to manually move the cursor down before starting to type. (I know;…",

The problem I'm running into though is that the code blocks never recognize the conda environment. Below is my workflow for it and the error.\n ​\n This basically sets up my session and activates my conda environment, which is confirmed by the second command. This seems to work just fine.\n ```\n +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output\n conda activate tutorials\n echo $CONDA_PROMPT_MODIFIER\n +END_SRC\n ```\n Then I run some basic code and it fails at the imports with No module named 'jsonpickle'\n ```\n +BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session qiskit :results output :exports both\n import time import warnings from pathlib import Path\n import jsonpickle import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n import numpy as np from scipy import interpolate\n +END_SRC\n ```\n So I added in another block to check that it was installed with\n ```\n +BEGIN_SRC shell :session qiskit :results output\n pip3 freeze | grep pickle\n +END_SRC\n ```\n When running that it shows I have jsonpickle installed. On top of that, even outside of the conda environment I have jsonpickle installed, so if it wasn't recognizing the environment and went without one then I don't know how that error would appear. Taking the same code and putting it in a python file and running that works just fine.\n    submitted by    /u/Hercislife23  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just spreading the word about a(nother) great post by Mickey Petersen: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/securely-generating-totp-tokens-emacs\n It is not a new post, but I received today an email from GitHub which caught me off-guard, stating that my account would require 2FA from now on. And I really hate to tie any workflow of mine to the phone. I recalled having read something about it, and some searching brought me back to Mickey's post. Jackpot! Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey's help.\n I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel's `totp.el'. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.\n But Mickey's post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work. You may find it useful too, since you are likely to have received or to soon receive the same GitHub message (if you didn't already had 2FA set up).\n    submitted by    /u/gusbrs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run `C-k` to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:\n  \n(line present) Displays line\n (deteles line) `C-k`\n (line deleted) No display line\n (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment\n (line deleted) No display line\n  \nThis behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new \"state\" (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous \"state\" (when the word had been typed, etc).\n My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn't because I emptied my `init.el` and the problem still persists.

          "description": "A while ago I noticed that after Emacs I did have all the magit commands available, but forge wasn't loaded properly -- I saw no topics (Issues and Pull requests) not even in the project where I knew there were some and where I'd previously run forge-pull to set the local state up properly.\n Yesterday I thought I'd see if I could fix this. So started with trimming my setup down to the bare minimimum\n ``` (use-package magit :custom (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-traditional))\n (use-package forge :after magit) ```\n and found that to be working well, i.e. I didn't have to manually \"start\" forge by running e.g. forge-pull. I then re-introduced my setup piece by piece to see when it breaks. (Luckily it's not very big.)\n In the end I made this change, where the relevant bit is this:\n  (use-package forge :after magit - :general + :config (mes/despot-def forge-post-mode-map \"c\" '(\"submit\" . forge-post-submit) \n That is, I swapped the use of :general to :config when bringing in forge. (I'm still using :general when setting up magit as using :configresulted in keybindings going missing.)\n I can't pretend I know what's going on here, but my gut tells me there's some \"interesting\" interaction between straight.el, general.el going on.\n I'd love an explanation, but I'll be happy enough if this post will reduce someone else's head scratching when observing something similar.\n    submitted by    /u/magthe0  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example: all files in org-agenda-files plus whatever is in org-agenda-text-search-extra-files\n Includes any given headline (from the above files) if and only if it has a clock entry in a specified period -- last week, two months ago, etc\n Lists the headlines in chronological order (ascending, or user-selectable)\n Displays the headline itself, plus the relevant clock entry and associated text (i.e. it's not just an clock table)\n Is exportable using org-export-dispatch << This is important because the report is for more than just my own benefit. So, a mere dynamic view within emacs is not sufficient. I need to be able to produce a PDF, or HTML, or the like.\n Can do all this based only on the data and meta-data in the headlines themselves. That is, it should achieve my desired data output format without enforcing on me a data storage format. I'm adding this requirement because my (partial) solution to the problem so far has been to store my daily notes in a datetree format (fed by org-capture), which encodes information not just with a heading's data and meta-data but also in its position. But that is neither a complete solution, nor a good one even where it does go part way.\n  \nHow would/do you achieve this or something like it?[1]\n thx!\n [1] Ideally, using Org out-of-the-box, without having to write a bunch of lisp.

I was thinking of automating some of this work I've been doing and I started working on a small bot that could post a comment on every \"self\" post asking the OP to also take a look at the alternatives. \n The question is: would that be ok with the mods and the community here?

          "description": "In some of the projects I work with, there might be 25+ imports at the beginning of a file and I almost never need to look at them. On the other hand, I almost never use code folding, and my config already has so many packages in it that I wondered if I could hide those imports using only built-in functionality. Surprisingly, hideshow.el apparently doesn't have this functionality built in, so I took a crack at making it happen.\n After some fiddling, I came up with this: \n (defun rex/php-fold-use-block-initially () \"Hide the initial block of `use' statements in PHP buffers.\" (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (ignore-errors (re-search-forward \"^use \")) (set-mark (point)) (while (ignore-errors (re-search-forward \"^use \"))) (ignore-errors (hs-hide-comment-region (region-beginning) (region-end))) (deactivate-mark t))) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook hs-minor-mode) (add-hook 'php-mode-hook rex/php-fold-use-block-initially) \n This does what I want, but it's not elegant and it seems pretty fragile (then again, it hasn't broken yet and I've been using it for a couple of days now). Because it does work, I figured it might help someone else too if I shared it, ymmv. \n EDIT: In order to hide import/include/whatever keyword your language uses to include code from libraries or elsewhere, you would need to change the regex pattern \"^use \" to \"^include \" (for instance) and add the appropriate mode hooks. \n P.S. Now that I think of it, this function should actually be generalized to accept the pattern as an argument...\n    submitted by    /u/skyler544  \n [link]   [comments]",

I profiled it and it was pointing at a function called redisplay_internal taking up almost all of the usage, but when I expanded it the sub-functions didn't take up as much as redisplay_internal. Emacs -Q causes the redisplay_internal usage to drop considerably and the lag to go away. I'm wondering if anyone has had this issue or if not how I could go about further dissecting what is going on since profiling didn't lead me in the right direction.\n I have a sneaking suspicion doom modeline may be part of the issue since one of its functions has come up in the many profiling runs I've done. Disabling it seemed to help briefly, but redisplay_internal tends to stay higher than the emacs -Q profiling(in that it is lower than running M-x commands in cpu usage).\n EDIT: After singling out parts of my config it seems that doom-modeline is indeed the culprit.

I am a emacsclient user: I run emacs --fg-daemon with systemd user session and connect to emacs server through emacsclient (both GUI and TUI).\n The problem I am having now is: after running Emacs GUI client (v29.1 from Ubuntu 22.04 snap install) for a few hours, opening three dozons of buffers plus 1 LSP (gopls), I switched to Emacs client TUI. TUI hangs quickly (less than 1 sec) after connected to the server:\n  \nI see my active buffer of GUI in TUI for 0.5 sec => based on my understanding, this should not happen: a new client should not render the active buffer of another client\n Emacs TUI switched to scratch\n Emacs TUI stopped unresponsive\n Open another Emacs GUI client and this instance worked fine\n  \nWhat's the right way to debug this issue? Is there a way to dump the threads and stacks of the runtime? My hunch is LSP may be the problem. I hope to investigate before asking for more help.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/sherlockmao  \n [link]   [comments]",

What steps have you taken to make the user experience as smooth as possible?\n So far, I've come across Bozhidar's[1] post, which has been quite helpful. What's currently bothering me the most are:\n 1) Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts like \"Super + arrows\" for window manipulation. This is a known bug[2] across all WSLg applications due to the lack of support for this mechanism in non-native Windows' windows.\n 2) The inability to open files in the Windows system using Emacs (WSL2). This is particularly frustrating for Org files, of which I have quite a few on my disk.\n 3) Duplicate icon on the taskbar. I know it's a minor issue, but it's quite annoying. When I pin a shortcut for Emacs using \"Pin to taskbar,\" then open Emacs using the shortcut, it doesn't \"overlay\" the pinned application.

However, this approach isn't any faster than using org-babel-load-file in my opinion:\n (if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name \"config.el\" user-emacs-directory)) (load-file (expand-file-name \"config.el\" user-emacs-directory)) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name \"custom-init.org\" user-emacs-directory))) \n org-babel-load-file only auto-tangles during startup when it detects a modification; otherwise, it loads the cached stuff.\n The fact that Emacs initially loads the init.el file and then needs to access a different file, regardless of the method used, is what introduces a speed penalty.\n I was thinking about giving up on the Org literate setup, but right now, I don't have much time to redo my Emacs configuration in plain Emacs Lisp. I know there are cool stuff like the outshine mode, etc.. However, I'm wondering if there might be another way. Maybe there's a way to have Org mode directly add everything tangled into the \"init.el\" file? That would make Emacs load much faster without the need of a server/client thing.\n Also, do you think Org really adds a layer of unnecessary abstraction for a literate config, to the point where I should think about giving up at some stage?

          "description": "I've been playing with Emacs 29's native tree-sitter for indentation and other ideas. First impression: it's really so very powerful compared to the bad old days of regexp matching and even ppss. It just understand the code. So far so good.\n That said, I've been trying to assess performance impact for applications that run frequently, e.g. via font-lock. Finding node at point is insanely fast: a fraction of a µs. But to my surprise, tree-sitter actions like \"find all parent nodes starting from the current node\" tend to vary in duration from (still very fast) 2–10µs to hundreds of µs or even several ms, depending on where the search starts from. I certainly expect some variability as you navigate from different depths within the syntax tree, but repeatable factors of 1000 seems a bit extreme, and make it hard to predict performance for latency-sensitive code.\n Does anyone have insight into this performance variability? Do you experience it as well? Perhaps it depends on the parser backend (I've tried only python so far)? Or is it fundamental to the TS algorithm?\n An example simple code to try, from various code locations in a large-ish file:\n (benchmark-run 100000 (let ((n (treesit-node-at (point) 'python))) ; or whichever language you have (while n (setq n (treesit-node-parent n))))) \n Multiply the result by 10 and that is the number of µs each \"navigate up from node\" operation takes.\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "One can open an android APK as a project in Android Studio. If the APK has been installed on a mobile that has developer options enabled, it is then possible to get a log of what happens during the apps start up.\n Install the app on the mobile, ensure that the developer options are enabled. In developer options enable USB debugging. Connect the computer to the mobile with a USB cable. At first connection you will have to authorize (on the mobile) access from the computer. In developer options go to \"Select debug app\" and choose, say \"org.gnu.emacs\". Also enable \"Wait for debugger\".\n See the following web page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16929391/android-how-to-debug-apps-start-up-process\n Check that you can access the mobile from the computer by running from the command line e.g.:\n - adb -d shell\n ls\n Now open the APK as a project in Android Studio, if you have not already done this. In the device manager (View > Tool Windows > Device Manager), select you mobile under \"Physical\".\n Start emacs on the mobile. You should get a requester \"Waiting for debugger\". In Android Studio select Run > Attach to Process. This should open a debug console, but this window will probably only show that Android Studio connects to the app, but then loses the connection (because the app crashes).\n All is not lost: In the debug window select \"Logcat\" at the bottom. This will probably also not show a lot, but notice at the top of the window the text \"package:myapp\" or some such. Change this to \"package:org.gnu.emacs\", and you should now hopefully see a crash log.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/johan_widen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Here is how I succeeded in building Android emacs with the libpng library. The process is described in the emacs repo file ./java/INSTALL, but here are some additional details. My initial build of emacs with this library crashed at start up. I will describe in a separate post how I debugged this.\n I browsed to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng and made a git clone of the repo. I then used magit to select branch android13-release. There was no Android.mk file in that branch, so I looked for it in older release branches. The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.\n I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION := 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c\n Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.\n To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:\n --with-ndk-path=$HOME/projects/android/libpng\n After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:\n ls cross/ndk-build\n    submitted by    /u/johan_widen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ran either 29 or 30 on them in the past months. In the last couple of weeks I focused on the 29 branch, running the pretests and as of last week, installed the official 29.1.\n I guess I began to see slowness or lagging, since I explicitly began a bankruptcy on the older laptop - initially thinking I have too much packages. Everything was lagging: browsing org files, startup times, describe-variable took couple of seconds to return results, M-x completion with vertico had a noticeable lag with each key press, key press latency in writing, eglot jumping to definitions. So much so that I really started thinking about replacing my old laptop.\n Yesterday I decided that I want to test whether it's due to Emacs. I reverted back to 28.2 on both laptops. It was night and day. The new laptop flies; the old laptop runs smoothly so I even reverted the bankruptcy, adding back all the packages I removed and it's still as smooth as I remember Emacs running in the past. \n This is not a bug report. It's my own observation, running multiple versions of Emacs on old and new hardware, sometimes compiling from source, sometimes downloading from https://emacsforosx.com/. I just want to raise awareness, see if people have a similar experience. If enough evidence arises, perhaps someone who knows what they're doing can run benchmarks or profiling and we'll go from there.\n    submitted by    /u/troll-gpt  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I use emacs -nw while ssh'd from one Mac into another, everything works fine until I switch to another app on the local machine. At first I thought it was Cmd-Tab that was doing it, so I tried just clicking other apps, but the problem remains.\n It appears that any clicks I do in other apps are somehow registering inside of emacs in the terminal. Specifically, when I switch to another app, the emacs buffer also switches to another one. And usually when I click on something in another app (even the preferences app for Terminal itself), the Terminal will randomly insert I and O in whatever buffer is selected.\n Running Emacs 29.1, installed via homebrew. And I've had this issue on an older mac running Big Sur as well as a newer mac running a more recent OS, both ssh-ing into an M1 MacBook pro with all my files on it. \n Ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/joegilder  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello!\n I’m an Emacs newbie. I’m on macOS (Emacs 29.1 with native comp and pixel scroll). I want to use Emacs for managing a lot of my Markdown notes in a specific folder, and also implements Org-Mode. I have thousands of notes in my folder. Coming from Obsidian, there was a very nice extension called Omnisearch that would index the content of my notes and allows me to search them easily (title and content). In Emacs, I think that rg.el (frontend for ripgrep) could allow me to easily search through my notes. I heard about org-roam and some built-in search but I’m not interested in this package. I will start with mardown-mode and org-mode, and may try Denote in the future.\n My pain points and questions are the following:\n ​\n  \nDo you know which package could best match the search features of Omnisearch? As a beginner I’m a bit lost with the sheer amount of packages to do search (helm-rg, helm-ag, helm-org-riffle, deft, rg.el, counsel…). I settled on rg.el but I am not sure.\n When I open Emacs, it always start at the directory ~/. If I only want to manage the files in the notes directory, how should I go about that? Should I always use Dired to go to the directory and then exit? Or should I create a project (project.el ) for the directory containing all my notes? I see that a lot of package have features to interact with projects. I am a bit unclear about when to create a project or not.\n I installed Helm because it is always mentioned (I prefer a single package to do the thing rather that the popular alternative that is a combination of a lot of small packages), but should I even use Helm at all if I want to use Emacs to write, edit and search notes? I’m a bit unclear about the real value for me (I’m probably not advanced enough).\n  \nThanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/Original_Bend  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nested indentation does not work as expected and there is this weird bug when using koopa-mode in Windows where autocomplete appends white space to cmdlets. I also started writing Emacs Lisp two weeks ago and have very little experience with LISP, so it is also likely my code is inefficient or just flat out awful. \n With that said, I love Emacs and want it to thrive, and someone suggested awhile back that the best way to support Emacs is to contribute to it.

          "description": "Hi all\n For various corporate reasons I'm using EMACS on Windows 10, with a shared folder tree to a Vagrant VM. I tried running emacs in the VM but even with a local X server the performance isn't great.\n I'm a \"lite\" poweruser under Linux and I have a lot of stuff like flyspell, flymake, lsp etc, Prelude, that I like to have configured.\n Now, a lot of the packages I use rely on Linux utilities (aspell, lsp server, etc) which are not available under Windows 10.\n I could possibly install cygwin but are there other options which I am overlooking? Can I get EMACS inside the VM running faster? Maybe use emacs-server? Does anyone have any suggestions to improve this configuration?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/dacydergoth  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello\n I have a particular issue related to indentation when using braces and brackets inside tabular-like environments handled by AUCTeX. I am using AUCTeX 13.2.1 with Emacs 29.1.\n Things work all right within regular content. As such, the following code is correctly formatted\n latex { xxxx { zzz } } [ yyy ] \n Custom environments are also correctly formatted\n \\begin{aaaa} { xxx } [ yyy ] \\end{aaaa} \n However, tabular as well as any other tabular-like environment handled by AUCTeX does not respect indentation; here, what I mean by handled is those environments whose formatting is set to LaTeX-env-tabular as well any other environment I append using LaTeX-add-environments and set to LaTeX-env-tabular.\n As an example, as soon as talltblr is on the list handled by AUCTEX, Emacs does not indent content inside brackets\n \\begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ... ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\\\\\ Y & Y & Y \\end{talltblr} \n I expect the following would be the correct formatting\n \\begin{talltblr}[ caption = {Somthing}, label = {tab:something}, % ..., ] { colspec = {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode=math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} = {font=\\bfseries}, } X & X & X \\\\\\\\ Y & Y & Y \\end{talltblr} \n One obvious solution is to remove or not to include environments in the list. However, I really like how AUCTeX formats tables. It adds required indentation between & and \\\\ to show where inner environments start. Hence, the code is much clearer and more readable with multiple inner and nested tabulars. The indentation would be a great addition to it.\n I ask this question in hope that perhaps someone has already sorted it out. I would also be grateful for any clues and pointers to start with.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/_-Big-Hat-_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, major modes like org-mode and magit are supported thankfully (using evil-collection) but unfortunately, I haven't come across a good way to integrated evil-mode with notmuch.

Currently, I'm just disabling evil-mode in every notmuch buffer and am using the standard emacs bindings.\n So as per the title, is there a way to integrated notmuch and evil-mode?

I would like it to open in the same window as the help buffer, using a tab (activating tab-bar-mode, of course). \n I aim to achieve something similar to this: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png\n Would anyone know how I could achieve this? I've been struggling to figure out how because the manual isn't clear about what variables we can use in the display-buffer-alist. \n Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!\n Thank you in advance! \n PS. Any other suggestions or hints about this function are also appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/mklsls  \n [link]   [comments]",

I setup a simple init.el file like so:\n ``` ;; Set up package.el to work with MELPA (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\"))\n ;; Download Evil (unless (package-installed-p 'evil) (package-install 'evil))\n ;; Download Catppuccin (unless (package-installed-p 'catppuccin-theme) (package-install 'catppuccin-theme))\n ;; Enable Evil (require 'evil) (evil-mode 1)\n ;; Enable Catppuccin (load-theme 'catppuccin :no-confirm) (setq catppuccin-flavor 'mocha) (catppuccin-reload)\n (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

On Windows 11 it does set the theme to Catppuccin so I know it's sourcing the init.el file correctly but it evil mode doesn't start working until after I manually toggle it via (M-x evil-mode)\n Also, if it makes a difference, I am using 28.2 on both WSL and straight Windows. \n It's just a minor inconvenience but if there is something I am missing that will fix it then I am all ears.\n    submitted by    /u/CraftMcMatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use custom emacs with doom theme and lots of other packages, namely counsel, ivy, lsp, projectile, some minor ones. Suddenly, lsp started to complain a lot with warnings, projectile stopped running my projects with qemu (but pure terminal works), a lot of other problems -- warnings in different packages. What are the basic steps I need to check after an upgrade? Yes, I have downloaded all packages from scratch but problems are still there.\n Right now, the most annoying thing is the way I run qemu with tun/tap interface enabled. If I run from separate console, my project starts as expected. If I run it as a command for projectile/run, qemu cannot open tap interface (resource is busy). Manual check of env in console/projectile does not show any significant differences.\n Edit: a bit more details\n    submitted by    /u/locutus-feles  \n [link]   [comments]",

Having a new major mode means that all hooks, key-bindings, major-mode checks, use-package’s, derived modes, and config need to be duplicated twice. And it's not only your own user config, but all packages need to add support for each new mode, even if they don't care about tree-sitter. \n Given that, the core developers must have had good reasons for not going the minor-mode route.

If the file is encrypted you are promoted to enter your passphrase with epa.\n Since I run emacs as a daemon, we can eval this function in the command line like this emacsclient -e \"(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))\" you will be promoted in the emacs session you are running.\n If you run this in a shell it is going to return the password with double quotes, but we can workaround that using simple string substitution in the shell. here is the final script;\n #!/usr/bin/env sh output=\"$(emacsclient -e \"(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))\")\" output_without_quotes=\"${output//\\\"/}\" echo \"$output_without_quotes\" \n And in mbsync config (isyncrc):\n PassCmd ~/configs/assets/getmupassword.sh \n    submitted by    /u/larrasket  \n [link]   [comments]",

After this change, I noticed that I had some knowledge gaps I wanted to fill and some skills I wanted to improve.\nI read technical documentation and watch online courses or webinars about technologies that were not my area of expertise, practices that are mostly in the software engineering world, new network or security concepts, and other stuff related to the so called \"soft skills\", such as How to Write Technical Documentation, How to become Persuasive, Give successful presentation, foreign languages. And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.\nFor all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven't found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine. I hope \"building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten\" will be something I could use for tasks and knowledge, but we'll see \nI read so many great forum posts here and shared workflows, I watch your great videos in youtube and I try to adjust my workflow when I see something that could make it better.\nI'm glad that I join zettelkasten.de forums",

          "description": "I am getting started on using Zettelkasten. Here is one of my zettels, the purpose here is to capture concepts in Indian philosophy and discover connections. I look forward to your critiques/feedback:\nIn Indian philosophy, light can be understood as both physical and metaphysical. \n\nPrakasha refers to manifested light. There are three types: \n* ordinary fire (_jada agni_), \n* sunlight (_saura agni_), \n* lightning (_vaidyuta agni_).\n\nThe original spiritual light is _jyoti_. \n\nHow does physical light interface with the metaphysical?\n* Physical light sustains life on Earth, for example, sunlight provides energy through photosynthesis. \n* [[Prometheus stole fire and was punished for giving power to humans]]\n* Light enables creation, as consciousness is the first element required.  \n* Light is involved in metaphysical visions too:\n1._Krishna_ grants _Arjuna_ a glimpse of his effulgent divine form, which _Sanjay_ also perceives through inner sight. \n2. The _Nachiketa_ and _Yama_ story conveys spiritual light's ability to illuminate the knowledge of death and immortality.\n\nSource: link",

          "description": "I have recently started using OpenAI-based MacWhisper to dictate notes. Perhaps many of you have used dictation for your notes, but I find that Whisper has extremely high quality and gets things like punctuation, hyphenation, capitalization and so forth correct even with my strongly Indian accent. One of the benefits I have seen from doing this is that my notes have become somewhat more conversational than before. I find this to be a benefit rather than something bad, because it seems to be capturing what I am thinking now somewhat better. Perhaps this conversational tone of the note might be more relatable a few years down the line, but that is just a guess.\nAll the whisper models of all sizes are free but Macwhisper provides a free way of accessing these for the three smallest models. If you want to use the larger models you have to pay a one-time fee of $20 to make that possible. Perhaps other free tools even with the large models will become available soon. In terms of privacy, one of the good things here is that the model is sitting on your computer so the data never leaves the computer and it seems safe even for private notes for that reason.",

Basically the main argument is that any note taken in obsidian, logseq or any other \"digital brain\" app is not necessarily zettelkasten.\nIt is written from a somewhat fundamentalist and provocative point of view, basically because I understand that there is a commercial rise in the indication of note-taking as a miracle cure, which can be very frustrating for people who embark on setting up a Zettelkasten unnecessarily.\nThe article is written in Spanish, but as we all know, it can be automatically translated online using the different online translators available today.\nI would like to know what you think of the proposal.\nLink to article: https://tdg.hypotheses.org/359",

The images look like this:\n\n\nAll images protected by copyright 4.0 (enforced by Interpol, Blackrock, the Illuminati, my secret identity and third personality). So, to the lurker who likes to \"borrow/bite\" other people ideas:\n\nI'd like to improve my visual game.\nI'd like to stop pestering Christian if I need something more pretty.\nSometimes, I use using software as a creative technique.\nIn few cases, I just want something pretty for myself.\nAnd what is better than appropriate skills by just buying shiny tools?

I discovered the Zettelkasten method a while ago and was very interested in it, and I wanted to introduce you to my \"study method\" (actually it is much more comprehensive than a study method).\nI did this method in the format of a planner or agenda, which can be downloaded in PDF at www.researchsheets.wordpress.com\nThis planner has 10 sections, but the method I want to show you corresponds to \"section 7: Research sheets\". They consist of a template similar to the Cornell method in appearance (top margin, left margin and bottom margin), but with a totally different operation, since these \"Research sheets\" will serve us to hierarchize and breake down the information, and then add it to a glossary / thesaurus in Microsoft Excel.\nThe procedure itself is somewhat difficult to explain, so I prefer not to confuse you further and invite you to download the planner and go directly to section 7 - Research sheets.\nAs I said at the beginning, I think it has some similarities with the Zettelkasten method. I hope my method is useful to you and I am available for any questions or comments.\nThank you very much for reading me!",
