It's been a phenomenal, intellectually rewarding journey and it's by far my favourite programming language.\n However, I've reached a point in my Haskell journey where I feel like I should either put it on the side and learn other things, or continue with it, but on a more narrower, specialized path. \n I know Haskell is a general purpose programming language and can be used to solve any programming problem, but so are other programming languages such as Python or C/++. \n But I can't help but feel that since Haskell is unique, it must have a domain that it uniquely excels in. \n What does r/haskell think this domain is? I really want to continue learning and mastering Haskell, but I need a sense of direction.\n Thanks.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/JadeXY  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well, now I can't get it running on either current MacOS or Ubuntu:\n https://github.com/public-law/oregon-law-parser\n It's a pure Stack setup. I've tried many techniques using ghcup, different versions of Stack and GHC... The closest I could get is all the tests passing on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, but it reinstalls GHC 8.0.2 every time it runs the tests. (!)\n If this will take more than just a minute or two, I'm happy to pay for someone's time — have tests passing so I can further develop it and use it. For a stretch goal, I'd love it to develop it easily on my Mac with VS Code — so, running on the current recommended ghcup, hls, and ghc, all on Mac silicon. \n If this works out, I'm open to the person who gets this working again doing the new dev required — test and use it with the latest Oregon laws.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/dogweather  \n [link]   [comments]",

To people without a mathematical background such laws may seem intimidating; how would one even start to think about proving them for our own abstractions? In this episode of The Haskell Unfolder we will discuss examples of these laws, show how to prove them, and discuss common techniques for such proofs, including induction. We will also discuss why these laws matter; what goes wrong when they do not hold?\n The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.\n We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:\n https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder\n And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:\n https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com\n (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )\n    submitted by    /u/kosmikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially, I was trying to revive the defunct Z-Botan bindings, but stripping it of its non-building dependencies proved to be infeasible, and the embedded version of Botan also proved to be out of date. Rather than give up, I decided to make a project of it, and start from scratch with fresh bindings to the latest version in modern Haskell.\n This approach has been extremely rewarding, and today, I am proud to share that I have hit a wonderful milestone - I am halfway through implementing the low-level 1:1 bindings.\n Right now, the bindings support:\n  \nHashing\n Message authentication codes\n Symmetric ciphers\n Block cipher modes\n Public key signatures\n Bcrypt and Password hashing\n Random number generators\n Base16 and Base64 encoding\n  \nFrankly, it is awkward to use, isn't versioned yet, and does not even have any algorithm constants (yet!), but as long as you can read the Botan C FFI docs, it works - and if everything keeps going as smoothly as it has, a friendlier high-level interface isn't too far away.\n I don't have a project page yet, but if you want to follow this project, you can check out the repo, or you can follow the devlog on the Haskell Discourse where I've been more-or-less posting daily.\n Edited for minor typoes and an incorrect link\n    submitted by    /u/ApothecaLabs  \n [link]   [comments]",

This idea is known under many other names, such as \"Boolean blindness\" or \"Parse don't validate\".\n Most of the examples in this episode should be understandable to newcomers.\n The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks.\n We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:\n https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder\n And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:\n https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com\n (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )\n    submitted by    /u/kosmikus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Cross-posting from Discourse after two days without a response:\n  \n[…] what is the status of dynamic linking on Windows currently? The GHC User’s Guide suggests that it should be fairly simple to accomplish. But the relevant GHC Wiki article says there are problems with the ordinal value getting too large when the DLL has too many symbols. Normally I’d discount a 4-year-old article in favour of the current user’s guide… except that when I tried compiling to a DLL, I did indeed get an error message saying that the ordinals were too large. On Linux, each package is compiled to a separate .so file, which keeps them fairly small, but when I try the same GHC options on Windows, it just complains that there are no 'dyn' versions of the dependencies. Which would seem to indicate that it would work if I could compile the dependencies dynamically, but I can’t find any information on how to do so. This whole situation is quite confusing, and I would greatly appreciate some clarification on GHC’s support for compiling shared libraries on Windows.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is also a mapM which returns the foldable type containing the result of each computation, but in this case we use the underscore version since we're only concerned with the side-effects of putStrLn.\n Sometimes it's boring to sit for hours and sift through the docs to find functions like mapM_, so I think these kinds of concrete examples are really nice for people who are just getting comfortable with Haskell.\n Upvote if you learned something!\n ```haskell fizzBuzz :: Int -> String fizzBuzz n = case (mod n 3, mod n 5) of (0, 0) -> \"FizzBuzz\" (0, ) -> \"Fizz\" (, 0) -> \"Buzz\" (_, _) -> show n\n main :: IO () main = mapM_ (putStrLn . fizzBuzz) [1..100] ```\n    submitted by    /u/Dr_Alg  \n [link]   [comments]",

(https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/08-IO.pdf)\n But my question is more related to the algorithm. \n Basically, as I understand it, the problem boils down to basically doing DP on trees. We need to select some nodes from the tree that maximizes a sum based on the condition that if we select a node, then its parent cannot be selected (based on \"whose immediate boss is also at the party will not have any fun at all\"). Thus, I take it that immediate means direct parent only right? \n To help you out, here's a tree diagram. The green checkmark represents nodes that are selected. Bob is selected despite being grandparent to John and Sue, and it's perfectly fine right? \n https://preview.redd.it/od6vzv6vb1bb1.png?width=2265&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d698a7e5c0cbe09f0d01bb2c8fbcf36e8b768b\n Another one:\n https://preview.redd.it/bdmgh8hvb1bb1.png?width=2265&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0ca9e69ef30efcb66e49796ae40f9c3afc86e17\n The reason I ask this is when I was comparing my solution (https://github.com/aditya211935/CIS-194/blob/main/week-8/Party.hs#L32) with other solutions (https://github.com/OctaviPascual/cis194-IntroductionToHaskell/blob/master/homework-08/Party.hs#L83), almost all of them in the case where we don't take current element, don't take max of both values of the subtree, but only take the second value. \n I checked a lot of other solutions and all of them have some bug or the other, so I'm unable to verify my solution. Would really appreciate any help in verifying my solution. For context, my solution on parsing \"company.txt\" produced \"33200\".\n    submitted by    /u/chodbahadur2  \n [link]   [comments]",

Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This new version provides comprehensive tests for the C99 backend, and introduces a breaking change in the definition of the type Arg in copilot-language. For details, see [2]. The new version is already available on Hackage [4].\n As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Sep 7th, 2023.\n We are also extremely excited to announce that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-language and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].\n There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned.

Maybe it wasn't the best choice back then, since we really only have an http (mostly) REST backend server, but coming from a Java background, that seemed like a good one-stop-shop.\n Now, given the current maintenance state of the framework, plus the fact that a few other teams have moved to spring-based solutions, we are evaluating where to move next.\n The first choice would be to use Akka-HTTP directly (despite the price), but then that would still require us to rethink:\n  \nDI framework (guice for play) and service lifecycle - do we need that?\n Actions and action composition - filtering and refining requests\n String translation\n Routes generation - we really liked how easy was to find routes information in play with routes files\n  \nI played a bit with http4s and tapir, and loved how clean the functional interfaces are, but my colleagues and managers are arguing that \"it is not widely used and we just wanna use frameworks/libraries that have good/active support\".\n I did some research, and despite seeing that most of the libraries mentioned across the website have frequent-enough updates, I'm not sure which ones are more \"reliable\" on long term.\n Also, if anyone has any insight, or faced similar problems before, how did you get a resolution?\n Thank you all!\n    submitted by    /u/iaco86  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a stupid question. I create a trait that attempts to encapsulate a third party library. Initially there will only have one specific library instance implementation (Let's called it library A). Later on there will add some others. To my best of knowledge, I can make use of type class for such purpose. The code is below.\n # Scala version 2.12.x # JDK 11 trait MyTrait[T] { ... some methods ... } object MyTrait { def apply[T: MyTrait]() = implicitly[Logging[T]] implicit val lib1 = new MyTrait[Lib1]{ ... } } \n Now there is another question coming in. When using this library A, it depends on some external information. However, when creating type class, it can't pass additional information because it's created by initializing trait. Though I can directly pass those additional information during implicit trait initialization like `new MyTrait[A] { val a = ...; val b = ...; }`, it's hard coded, and becomes global variables, which looks not right to me. \n Any suggestions to achieve such goal in a better way?

In general, I think it is great (I enjoy more the scala2 syntax) but documentation is kind of lacking, and native libraries are all over the place. Having to deal with sbt was a thing and making intellij lint, compile and run was an experience. My last complaint is that I had to create my own dockerfile which I am really bad at, like it was really hard to find anything for Scala. \n Despite that I really enjoy working with Scala as a Java developer, probably will never get a job on it because I dislike data science and at least where I live there is like 0 demand. I am thinking of doing comparable projects in C# and Kotlin to see how they compare to Java and Scala. Hopefully, Scala will regain some popularity but for that, they will probably need a big company behind it, improve documentation, and better native libraries. \n The last thing, this is my opinion and I am dumb as a rock so you have all the right to criticize my incoherent bag of words and correct me if I am wrong\n    submitted by    /u/Mpata2000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In some distributed protocols, servers (actors) transition between different roles at different times, and accept different subset of messages depending on the role.\n Ideally, an actor should always hold a reference to another actor typed in such a way that it is impossible for it to send the wrong type of message (i.e., a message that the other cannot accept because it is in the wrong role).\n The inherent problem is that, like I said, an actor can change role over time, and so the subset of messages it accepts; thus, all other actors holding a reference to it would actually start to hold a wrongly typed reference.\n Specifically, I am thinking to Raft consensus algorithm, where (for example) a server in follower state would not accept an AppendEntriesResponse message, but it is going to be able to accept it as soon as it transitions to leader state. If the behaviors are parametrized with a Raft type that comprises all messages (including AppendEntriesResponse), then it is easy to wrongfully send an AppendEntries to a follower.\n Does Akka have a pattern for this?\n Does this pattern also apply to actors running in clusters? Does it apply to both types of communication (ask, tell)?\n I know that it is possible for an actor to explicitly ignore some messages, but I believe it can become a bit cumbersome and perhaps prone to errors. Moreover, it does not eliminate the issue that I described above.\n    submitted by    /u/steddola  \n [link]   [comments]",

With Kube though, there is no reason to do so. Instead of giving a single process 8 cores you spawn 8 pods with cpu:1.\n My question is - how much of a reason do I have to give my cats-effect app 8 core vs spawning 8 instances?\n And also how much of a bottleneck is the process of serialization with cats services trying to do a lot of concurrent IO aka web servers? It's anecdotal since I was not there but at work, it was observed that NodeJs is dying very fast under the pressure of grpc encoding/decoding. But it seemed to me to be a mistaken judgment since it should be the same in cats/tokio/what-have-you so I think it was just easier for them to ramp up those core numbers with scala.\n    submitted by    /u/lionflzcfxpcuugdsh  \n [link]   [comments]",

The end goal I expected to be standard system notifications (e.g. notify-send) that you could configure to appear 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day before a scheduled event.\n UPDATE1: It appears that org-alert isn't working out of the box and requires some extra configuration - it is necessary to make org-notifications work.\n UPDATE2: seems that by default org-alert outputs to message buffer. Adding (setq alert-default-style 'libnotify) seems to have solved it.\n UPDATE3: looks it shouldn't be necessary. org-notifications should set alerting style to libnotify already when running (org-notifications-start), so adding it to (after! org... ) block should be enough (hopefully).\n UPDATE4: above doesn't work.

I could just use avy-goto-char-timer, but it would show all other matches in the buffer, so making it unique is harder and sometimes impossible, so I have to press the target key(s).\n Looking at the implementations, I'm a bit stuck though, as avy-goto-char-in-line uses avy-jump for scoping, which is based on regexes, but avy-goto-char-timer gets the candidate list with avy--read-candidates, where I don't see how I would scope to the current line (and which looks harder to extend, as it's quite complex).

I have tried replacing [C-i] by \"<C-i>\" since (kbd \"<C-i\">) returns [C-i], but it does not pass the is-valid-key-p check.\n Any key-binding guru here, ready to settle the matter and help me and others understand the proper way to achieve this with the new API ?\n I know I could leave it as is, or rebind stuff to Hyper-I, but that's not a satisfying answer\n Thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/Horrih  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know what I want from an editor and am ready to spend a lot of time customizing one of these editors, but I don't want to do it twice. So I will tell my preferences and it would be really great to get your advice.\n  \nI prefer to use an editor in terminal, without additional gui. As far as I know neovim is tui app, while emacs is not. However, I can run emacs in my terminal. How much I lost not using gui version of emacs?\n \nI want to create and edit notes and to-do's using an editor. I am not going to use it as a calendar as I prefer to use apple calendar on my macbook and iphone. How many advantages does org-mode have over simple md? Also I've read about org-mode for neovim...\n \nI want to try to use an editor as ide too. I'm angular developer and I'm working on rather large project (main project contains about 7k files). I'm worried about the performance of the autocomplete. Unfortunately, I failed to find ready-made configs for emacs and neovim to open the project and see for myself.\n \nI definitely don't want to use my editor as browser, gaming platform, email client, window manager etc etc. Honestly, looks like neovim is winner here :)\n \nI don't want to use something like spacemacs, emacs-doom, etc., just self-written configs. And I don't know what is better in this case - elisp or lua/vimscript.\n \nI have no preference between emacs or vim hotkeys. Both are good.\n \nEmacs startup time is significantly worse than neovim's, even though I have very few plugins installed. Can I fix it without using client-server? It's not a big problem, but it's annoying.\n \n So i'm looking for a lightweight and fast editor for notes and development on angular. Should I spend my time on emacs or neovim?

The subjects were twelve students; six were novices and six were regular users. Significant objective performance differences were confined to the novice users; here emacs consistently outperformed vi with respect to time taken to perform the tasks and the amount of help needed.

So here are my main question(s):\n  \nHow can I test that my package rolodex.el works before I submit a PR to the Melpa repo?\n What other things am I missing (README aside, I still wanna write that)?\n  \nHere's my code if anyone wants to take a gander: rolodex.org\n It's still early(ish) in its development, but it should work (at least the original code works in my init file), so it shouldn't be judged as complete. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/codethrasher  \n [link]   [comments]",

In short, out of the box, Screen does not seem to support italic fonts when used with a standard terminal, e.g. xterm. Since lots of recent Emacs packages use italics, e.g. Marginalia, this is quite annoying. Without italics support, Screen places some ugly underlines to highlight text.\n A way to check italics support is to run chinfocmp -1 | grep -E 'ritm|sitm'. When run inside Screen, the output is empty. When run without Screen, the output is not empty. I have not found a $TERM value that uses standard termcap or terminfo database entries that fixes this issue inside Screen.\n What is your setup for running Emacs inside Screen with good italics support?

I'm forced to use a Mac for work, and primarily remote display Emacs through x2go and Xquartz. I can't figure out how to bind a key to Super. By default, option is used for Meta, but command key combos seems to send international characters to emacs rather than get recognized as a modifier. When I'm running locally on the Mac, `(setq mac-command-modifier 'super)` works, but since my remote emacs isn't running on MacOS this has no effect. As far as I can tell, Super doesn't show up in Xquartz configuration at all. Is this just a missing feature I'm going to have to live with? \n And if you're wondering why I don't just run locally and use TRAMP, I am doing a lot of python debugging, dap-mode with debugpy is a vastly superior debugging environment to gud-pdb, and dap-mode is broken on TRAMP.\n    submitted by    /u/jsadusk  \n [link]   [comments]",

Third Item \n And then kill each line one by one with C-k when I look at my kill-ring with browse-kill-ring I have the expected:\n 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1. First Item \n But then if I yank with C-y I get back 3. Third Item but now my kill-ring looks like:\n 3. Third Item ------- 3. Third Item ------- 2. Second Item ------- 1.

Second Item I again just see the third item, and I always need to call yank-pop three times to actually start getting back into the kill-ring.\n I am running fairly vanilla Emacs, with no packages shadowing the yank/kill commands.

I've been using task management paradigms to fulfill the missing context of the tasks in the agenda. Until I found this article recently Task management with org-roam Vol. 5: Dynamic and fast agenda which was really helpful. Ironically, I had seen it even before but i didn't give it much attention because I assumed it will be deadly slow. After applying it, my agenda has become a little bit slower, but it was just fine. After this, I learned that using org-ql for the agenda (instead of org search) makes it faster up to 5 times, and there is cache support. Now the agenda loading speed is no longer a problem, and each task has full context and relation tags to its categories.\n    submitted by    /u/larrasket  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "An idea I've had for a package for a while is one that would use spaced repetition to teach keyboard shortcuts.\n My thinking is that it would draw the shortcuts to teach from a few lists, including: - Shortcuts manually set by the user. - Shortcuts for functions often called by the user with M-x. - A manual list of shortcuts the user could define (this could include shortcuts for programs outside of Emacs).\n A simple idea, but I feel what could make it handy is that, if the user uses a keyboard shortcut in the normal course of using Emacs, that would count as a 'review' of the shortcut. So that would delay the next time that shortcut will come up.\n If a shortcut became a part of their regular use, the review time would get so long, they never see it again (so they're not wasting time learning shortcuts they have already internalised).\n I've been using a very rudimentary and undocumented version of this for some time, and I've found it an enormously helpful tool to help myself learn keyboard shortcuts.\n Interested to hear if others would find this valuable, or if this is something only I'd find worthwhile.

If you aren't aware, this is a package that provides functionality to mu4e similar to Gmail's \"schedule send,\" which sends emails after a designated amount of time, rather than immediately. In addition refactoring the codebase, this package is also compatible with Org-msg. There are other differences, and they are enumerated in the newly-renovated README.\n The original repository may not be maintained anymore, and has been inactive for the last several years at the very least. I use the package myself but had to clean up and update the code so it works with current Emacs.

          "description": "Emacs comes with two built-in IRC clients, rcirc and erc. The latter has a history entry in its manual ((info \"(erc) History\")) and thus sheds a little bit of light on its age:\n  \n7 History\n  \nERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin. They stopped development around December 1999. Their last released version was ERC 2.0.\n ...\n 2006\n ERC 5.1 was released. It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.\n  \nrcirc on the other hand is missing such an entry, but the copyright starts at 2006, roughly around the inclusion of ERC within Emacs. If you searche the Emacs manual for IRC, you end up with two mentions, one within Acknowledgments for ERC, one for \"Bug Reference\":\n  \n3. Setup for IRC channels configurable by the variable ‘bug-reference-setup-from-irc-alist’. The built-in IRC clients Rcirc, and ERC, are supported.\n  \nNowhere within Emacs do I find a comparison why there are two, and whether there are different use cases for both.\n With that in mind: what are the (architectural?) differences between ERC and rcirc? If ERC already existed, why was rcirc also included in Emacs?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/qZeta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since, headings and sub-headings are a lot, so I'm used to only showing first-level headings and opening up a certain heading when I know exactly that it has sub-headings. If I use C-Tab, all second-level sub-headings of first-headings will be shown up, which adds more obstacle for navigating!\n In ideal, sub-headings of their parent heading should also have this symbol in the end of them, if they have their own sub-headings.\n It's gonna be a dream to come into reality, so I can finally, completely move from zim to emacs.

If cursor is already at the end of the screen line, point should move to the end of the physical line.\n Pos1 should behave likewise, with an additional twist: If point is at the beginning of a screen line but not at the beginning of the physical line, it moves to the beginning of the physical line. If I additionally press pos1 and the beginning of the physical line is a blank character (character class), it moves to the first non-blank character of the line.

I'm under the impression that string-equal is comparing \"yes\" and \"%\\\\1\" and thus evaluating to \"Enjoy\".\n Yes case: If I type in yes at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:\n ***** Hot Dog Prompt: yes Hot Sauce? yes Enjoy \n No case: If I type in no at the HOT_SAUCE prompt and press ENTER, the preview changes to:\n ***** Hot Dog Prompt: no Hot Sauce? no Enjoy \n In both cases the first format function is re-evaluated with the value entered at the prompt.\n In neither case is the second format function re-evaluated.\n According to the documentation on %(EXP):\n  \nOnly placeholders pre-existing within the template, or introduced with ‘%[file]’, are expanded this way.

          "description": "I recently upstreamed some fixes to a project called helm-ls which is a language server for Helm to make it work with eglot. As part of my contribution, they asked for instructions for use with emacs, which I provided in the README.\n The only problem I have with the instructions I gave is that it feels counterintuitive a little bit? The root of the problem is that, while you could edit Helm charts with yaml-mode, adding eglot-ensure to the yaml-mode hook would mean adding (yaml-mode \"helm_ls\" \"server\") to eglot-server-programs, and you probably don't want helm-ls for yaml files that aren't helm charts. Hence my instructions to create a small derived major mode to sidestep the issue.\n That works okay, but means that it becomes hard to automatically enter the newly derived helm-mode. I've read through how emacs chooses major modes, but I couldn't think of a good way to automatically select helm-mode. Ideally, I'd love to have some way of telling auto-mode-alist to traverse up the current buffer's directory until it found files like Chart.yaml and values.yaml that told it the file was actually a Helm chart rather than plain yaml, but it looks like I may be limited to just regex matching the file name, using .dir-locals.el or -*- mode: helm -*- magic.\n Any other ideas/options to make this better?\n Edit: link formatting\n    submitted by    /u/leothrix  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please help me resolve this.\n  \nFor all the double-spacers out here, what do you do when you have to work on someone else's project which uses single-spacing between sentences? Do you have any shortcuts or tricks to switch to single-spacing mode when you are working on their projects?\n \nHow do you space sentences within double quotes, like:\n Bob said, \"I get three apples. You get two apples. Ok?\" Jess responded, \"No, I get three apples. You get two apples.\" Bob was not amused.

I probably search with the wrong terms since I always get links to css frameworks (Tailwind, bulma...).\n What I do miss is - how to add a background to the first page of the pdf - how to add a different one to the other pages - how to add author's information (name, company, copyright...) on a last page...\n ... all this based on the headers or properties of my org document.\n Reading the file htmlize.el did not help.\n Can you please help me or point me in the right direction?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fmou67  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I've wanted to make customizations to Spacemacs, the whole layering system is so abstracted from standard Emacs stuff that it was often difficult to figure things out in regards to online sources often using vanilla Emacs for their instructions. But I made do, eventually figuring things out as best I could.\n Recently, I've been learning CLisp (and plan on learning Clojure as well), and I've wanted to start taking advantage of the true power of the dark side of the Force Emacs, which is, creating an editor that's very much specifically tailored to you, because as I want to do certain things, I definitely feel the edges of Spacemacs pushing back.\n For the past few weekends, I've been following along with Emacs from Scratch from System Crafters, looking at some of Prot's stuff, reading the manual where needed, copiously using `describe-function/variable/etc`, reading a bunch of configs that I've found that people have mentioned as being inspirations for them. Things are moving along mostly smoothly and I'm making really great progress and it feels really fantastic to start slowly tailoring things to how I want them....\n ... but then I look at the setup for, say, Clojure, in something like DoomEmacs or Spacemacs or some Emacs expert's config, and I start to feel a bit overwhelmed because, here's a thing that an entire community has worked on to optimize and hack away at and improve and I'm just barely scratching the surface. And as much as I'm really enjoying the journey of customizing GNU Emacs, I'm also a very practical dev and really recognize the benefits of a distro.\n And in moments like these, I kinda just retreat back into Spacemacs because, damn girl, so much work has been done on it!\n Any sage advice on how to tackle this whole process better?\n    submitted by    /u/adudenamedruby  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried installing doom-modeline but there was no icon support (even after installing nerd-icons). Any suggestions are appreciated!\n Update: Figured it out. 1) As suggested by u/spudlgo I used use-package to install doom-modeline and run nerd-icons-install-font in emacs. This downloaded NFM.ttf in .local/share/fonts 2) Run fc-cashe -fv to update font cashe and then fc-list | grep .local/fonts . This makes a list of all the fonts in the directory. One needs to note down the name of desired font. 3) I opened dconf editor and searched for 'fonts' under terminal folder. The terminal profiles are going to pop up. I copied the name of the font I wanted to the 'font' bar. 4) change the terminal profiles and it's done.\n Note that the changes need to be done in the local machine.

Mostly it is just visual noise and it essentially does not interfere with typing, but combined with copilot it just becomes a noisy kindergarten. I was wondering if there are others out there with similar concerns and how you would tackle this ? \n I have rebound my tab to company-completion for while, but I found it to be a bit uneven, for instance you´'d get nothing if no completion was found, making you doubt if it was working at all. Also, since then I have moved to vertico and from what I gather its completion trigger is organised differently and it also does not solve my copilot issue. \n The reason for this post is that all info on completion is about automating all the tings and shower you with info while doing the dev, b/c we want to be vscode so much. \n Instead I was looking for some inspiration regarding a different paradigm, an on-demand approach with the option to get more info on the class/function/type, or in the case of copilot, a snippet.\n thx. \n    submitted by    /u/Sndr666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the time it works fine, but occasionally (frequently enough to be very annoying, but infrequently enough to be hard to reproduce!) it seems to get \"out of sync\", and I get a bunch of random errors that don't match the file I'm editing.\n For example, I'm currently editing a file that has no genuine errors or problems, but flymake-show-buffer-diagnostic reports 1 error [\"unmatched ')'\"] and 30 warnings (indentation errors, \"unexpected spaces around keyword\", etc.).\n Saving the file makes no difference.\n C-x C-v reloads the file and the errors disappear. Running eglot-reconnect also fixes the errors.\n eglots-events-buffer is a bit hard to interpret but it looks like at least some of the spurious errors are being received from pylsp.\n I don't know how to track down this problem as I don't know which component has the problem. Presuambly it's not flymake, but is Eglot sending the wrong file data? pylsp reporting the wrong thing? Some kind of JSON RPC issue? Something else I'm missing?\n Any tips on how to track down the issue?\n My eglot config is minimal:\n ```\n (use-package eglot\n :ensure t\n :defer t\n :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure)\n :bind ((\"C-c r\" . eglot-rename)\n (\"C-c C-r\" . eglot-rename))) ```\n I'm running\n emacs 28.1 (same problem occurs with 29)\n pylsp v1.7.4\n ​\n ubuntu 22.04\n    submitted by    /u/chimprich  \n [link]   [comments]",

But modus is obvious masterpiece.\n This is emacs, so obviously I want to modify if something bother me.\n As a result, I finally started making a theme that felt fine to me. (I say fine because, I don't think it is complete or perfect)\n 📜 Info\n There is no science or principle behind this theme. Just some colors lying on your screen. If many of you do not like it, i might tweak and change some colors for community purpose. Or else, i might improve and add some goodies.\n Screenshots are here: https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org\n As of now, I dont plan on making light theme, I'm not a light theme user. But if many want light variant, I might take it up in near future.\n ⭐ Features\n  \nUsually in themes, background of mark region, completion bar gets noticed. So i made haki-change-region, which changes region color in many places on the fly.\n There are variables like haki-*-font, which has respective use cases to look good in org, markdown, elfeed.\n Also for meow or evil users, you can use haki-modal-mode-line which changes the mode-line border color accordingly to states.\n  \nToo long, Don't wanna read;\n  \nhttps://github.com/idlip/haki.\n It is available in melpa!\n Screenshots => https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org\n  \nAs a side note, I manage my whole system (nixos) and emacs in literate org-mode and it has been great.

          "description": "My name is Paribanú Freitas. I am a psychologist and university professor in my country, Uruguay. I am currently doing my doctoral thesis in \"social studies\" and I came to the zettelkasten method by different youtube content creators.\nThrough my work I have always been interested in the worlds of productivity and the articulation between educational processes and difficult resources of intellectual work. In fact, a few years ago I have been blogging on this last subject, although I do not publish very much on it: www.tdg.hypotheses.org .\nClearly for those of us who are knowledge workers at different levels (and especially if that knowledge is academic knowledge) I believe the zettelkasten method is really essential and definitive. Luhmann's productivity clearly demonstrates it and I do not understand how the teaching of the method in depth and in a practical way is not part of the educational grids at the university level.\nCurrently, along with researching and implementing the method in order to support my doctoral research, I am thinking of opening an extracurricular and open course at my university on digital tools for intellectual work, study and writing techniques, time organization resources and other skills and technologies to be \"taught\" by Twitch. There are already many students who have shown interest in the proposal and I love that it's on Twitch since I think I'm a bit of a geek despite my age.\nFinally, this semester I have also created a discord community (in Spanish) for postgraduate students from Latin America. If anyone is interested, I leave the link in case it works: https://discord.gg/c7CX6TVExH\nI'm glad I found this community and I'll be participating in it frequently for sure. Thank you so much!",

          "description": "I need to make a big compliment @ctietze!\nI am always testing other pieces of software to improve my coaching, since not everybody uses The Archive. But whenever I start to use other apps, I am put off by their stutters and bugs. I think I report once every six months that something is off.\nI started to use Apple Notes for collaboration (family stuff, with Christian, for a Podcast etc.). If I imagine that there are teams behind Apple Notes while Christian is 100% on its own, just with nagging me as a support, I am baffled.\nIn some way, I have the blessing to experience The Archive as a user with the most intimate user support possible. I have very high requirements for the software that I use to access my Zettelkasten because my work is very intense (after 6 hours of work I am often soaked in sweet). The software needs to get out of my way. The Archive is almost invisible to me now, almost like air. And similar to air, The Archive provides a vital foundation for me functioning.\nSo: Very good, @ctietze !",
