In this example I probably would need  determinant :: Matrix -> Float \n This often means I am rewrapping xss in Matrix just to pass it to determinant, which is cumbersome and I don't know if that would cause performance issue?\n Is there a way in the function pattern matching to get xss and an additional variable to bind the whole Matrix xss so I can pass it around?

The docs say:\n  \nOn POSIX-compatible platforms GHC’s runtime system (when built with libdw support) will produce a stack trace on stderr when a SIGQUIT signal is received\n  \nIt doesn't say here how to build with libdw support, but I read somewhere elsewhere that one needed to add --enable-dwarf-unwind, and indeed when I did that the GHC build initially complained about not being about to find the libdw library until I added elfutils to the buildInputs.\n The error message also doesn't make it clear whether the build of GHC doesn't support backtraces or the build of my executable doesn't support backtraces. Which makes hunting this down even more difficult.\n What am I missing?

I have a shell script that converts these into HTML files using Pandoc (because what kind of Haskell enthusiast would I be if I didn't use Pandoc!).\n I am using the Haskell library to make filters for my Pandoc, and I see I can use multiple instances of --filter but I would rather not and just have my one filter do everything I need. Lets say I wanted to do something to any Inline Str instance that starts with a @ and I also want to act on any Block Codeblock instance that is a $haskell type: ```haskell module Main where\n import qualified Data.Text as T import Text.Pandoc.JSON\n main :: IO () main = do -- toJSONFilter dollarHaskellBlock toJSONFilter linkToBlog return ()\n -- | Lets me act specially on codeblocks labeled '$haskell' dollarHaskellBlock :: Block -> Block dollarHaskellBlock (CodeBlock (identifier, cls:clss, keyValue) codeText) | cls == T.pack \"$haskell\" = CodeBlock (identifier, T.pack \"haskell\":clss, keyValue) newCodeText where newCodeText = codeText -- do something here dollarHaskellBlock x = x\n -- | adds a link to any blog with a word in the form @word linkToBlog :: Inline -> Inline linkToBlog (Str strText) | head strString == '@' = linkTo where strString = T.unpack strText linkTo = Link ( T.empty , [] , [] ) [ Underline [ Str (T.tail strText) ] ] ( T.pack (\"./\" ++ (tail . T.unpack . T.toLower) strText ++ \".html\") , T.empty ) linkToBlog x = x ```\n In this case I can use one or the other here and the executable will act as a filter, but I feel like I should be able to do one after the other, but just running both in the do block fails :(.\n Is there a solution here?

Of course, I am using current time just for the sake of the example; it can be any other function that the module does not need to know about.\n I know that Haskell allows that, but would warn about orphan instances. For that purpose, I followed the GHC compiler advice and used the wrapped type; although I liked the code better with orphan instance.\n I wonder—what would be the better way to implement such StopWatch?

          "description": "Sorry for verbose, detail is here.\n At first, I'm reading https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf to understand \"Free monad\". I mean the word FFree in title is from this paper.\n And maybe I have been able to understand what is FFree in this paper. This paper says FFree is a data type which has two aspects Pure and Impure, especially Impure works as an action handler like monad's >>= and it presents fmap. I think that FFree seems very simple and reasonable.\n So I implemented FFree monad as written in the paper. ```haskell {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} import Control.Monad ((>=>)) data FFree f a where Pure :: a -> FFree f a Impure :: f x -> (x -> FFree f a) -> FFree f a\n instance Monad (FFree f) where Impure fx k' >>= k = Impure fx (k' >=> k) Pure a >>= k = k a ```\n And I need Functor and Applicative for Monad instance.\n ```haskell instance Functor (FFree f) where fmap f (Pure a) = Pure (f a) -- Continuous is here, impressible. fmap f (Impure fx k) = Impure fx (fmap f . k)\n instance Applicative (FFree f) where pure = Pure Pure f <> Pure a = Pure (f a) Pure f <> Impure fx k = Impure fx (fmap f . k) Impure fx f <> p@(Pure _) = Impure fx (\\x -> f x <> p) -- I have no idea how implement this pattern. Impure fx f <> Impure gx g = undefined `` I could writeFunctorwith no problem (maybe), but I couldn't write<>implementation betweenImpurecase. Here is my question again, how do I implementFFree` of Applicative?\n From the first, What does Applicative applying between Impure mean theoretically?\n P.S. No need to ensure what a compiler says, I know why I can't it. Left hand f x and right hand one are rigid types each other.\n    submitted by    /u/Unique-Staff-7593  \n [link]   [comments]",

During syntax analysis, it was easy to keep track of the line and column numbers where the parsing failed and report back what was expected and what the compiler needed. \n But if the parsing succeeds, the generated AST is passed on to check the semantics. However, my AST nodes do not store any positional (or spanning) information. So if I find a semantic error, I can only tell what the error is but cannot provide any line or column number information.\n The easiest way to solve this is to store the spanning information on most nodes I have defined, which is tedious and lengthy.

Coming from C++ background, I understand \"built-in\" as constructs recognizable by compiler without including external libraries. In Haskell however I see in many literature sources, types like Int|Num| Bool, are treated as \"built-in\", or core language features, though they can be easily \"excluded\", by disabling Prelude module, which in my understanding is just external \"library\" included by default. To add to confusion, some core language constructs, like guards will not even work without including Prelude. On other hand constructs like \n import Prelude() \n foo x = 1\n compiles well, but then what is the \"1\" type in this case (Isn't Num defined by including Prelude)?\n So I guess the question is - Where true (in C++ sense) bult-in language features can be found if at all. And should Prelude be understood as true external library or as \"grey area\" combining both traits of external library and compiler intrinsic syntax. \n    submitted by    /u/klazklaz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks, \n I've been working professionally in Scala for the last year and a half and it was nothing but unrest.\n First, the Scala 3 migration started this painful event that fragments the already fragmented multi versions hassle that everyone needs to go through 2.12 / 2.13, and now 3. Have to mention, this is not only dependent on our codebase. For example, Databricks is still on 2.12, on the other hand, some new libraries are Scala 3 only, or Scala 2 support was deprecated.\n Then Akka became a non-open source, and we had to find a solution and picked the Typelevel ecosystem.\n There was another \"shock\" to the ZIO ecosystem when their leader left the project. Fortunately for us, we haven't invested in ZIO not a single hour, but this is another negative event in Scala ecosystem.\n After working for half a year with Typelevel, we wrote some services and a few internal libraries. It wasn't bad, maybe not as simple as Akka, but it worked as expected. However, it was a huge struggle for half of the team to understand this code and for some to even understand the concept.\n Then Pekko came out and we had another meeting, where 100% of the team voted against using Typelevel again.\n So, we are \"officially\" using Pekko for all our new services, which is basically the old Akka in maintenance mode. I don't see how this stack has any future.\n Now, it looks like a few experimental libraries evolve around virtual threads. My bet this is the future of Scala since they are simple yet powerful as Effect systems.\n But I hear more and more people are saying - until these are ready, there will be \"no Scala\", since the language in a rapid decline (sad, but true).\n Sharing this because I'm tired of the constant unrest in Scala, and curious what strategy your team has regarding this.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Confident_Cupcake861  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, I was trying to lift the api version into the type system to clean up some code so that the focus of the code was on the business logic instead of determining what api version to use in a bunch of places / passing around a isV1 boolean everywhere. This does mean that the api version would need to be determined at runtime, and nothing I've tried has made it able to get the client implicitly. I thought with everything sealed and having implicit defs for both of V1/V2 that it would work, but I'm guessing type erasure / something with subtyping makes it indeterminable. I tried classtags and the aux pattern, but couldn't get it to work. This is scala 2.12 btw. I have something like this:\n sealed trait ApiVersion object ApiVersion { sealed trait V1 extends ApiVersion sealed trait V2 extends ApiVersion } sealed trait ApiClient[Version <: ApiVersion] class V1Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] class V2Client extends ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] object ApiClient { implicit def v1Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V1] = new V1Client implicit def v2Client: ApiClient[ApiVersion.V2] = new V2Client } abstract class WrapperDomainObject { type Version <: ApiVersion } object WrapperDomainObject { def apply(thing: ApiThing) = if (/* some business logic */) new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V1 } else new WrapperDomainObject { override type Version = ApiVersion.V2 } } class Service { def serviceFn(thing: WrappedDomainObject)(implicit client: ApiClient[thing.Version]) = client.doBusinessThing } \n Is this possible?\n    submitted by    /u/kaitos  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some(12) } `` The result will beOption[Int]. If it would just look at the inner functon ofquestit would deductSome[Int]`. \n This works using a special trait called Resulting[T] which is triggered by quest being a context function. \n Resulting is also referenced by the question operator, thus the compiler is inferencing T to be None and Some[Int] resulting in Option[Int].\n The library triggers an early exit using Exceptions without Stacktraces. Measurements show, that this creates an overhead of ~5ns, which should be acceptable.\n Of course it won't work (and being dangerous) in lazy evaluated code (Futures, Lazy Collections, Effect Systems etc.).\n What do you think?\n Disclaimer: The base idea was already presented by Martin Odersky at Scalar Conference 2023 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fm0y4K4YO8 (which I rembered later in implementation)\n There is also an old thread.\n    submitted by    /u/dernob  \n [link]   [comments]",

If so, what is the reason for this? Compile time annotations like @tailrec or @depreciation still work, and I also saw that a MacroAnnotation class was introduced under an experimental flag in Scala 3.3.0, but I'm not sure what is left to accomplish so that it could be merged into the latest Scala version.\n I appreciate any clarification on this topic!

          "description": "This is a rather vague idea that is still forming:\n Could a SoC project be proposed to train or fine-tune a LLM on Scala code?\n Most LLMs are primarily trained on Python code, just because there is so much of it, leading to more generated Python code, ...\n For Scala there is less code to train on, on the other hand models like Phi-2 show that a smaller set of highly curated training data (in this case well-written code) can make even smaller models compete with bigger ones trained on \"the internet\".\n A fork of e.g. CodeLlama 70B, fine-tuned with the full Git history of successful Scala projects might decrease the gap between code generation capabilities for Python and Scala.\n The aider project proposes a diff format that is more amenable to LLM generation than the standard Git diff. The transformation from one to the other should be rather mechanical and a well-written Git commit is a very close to an instruction a human might give an LLM in order to get a code modification done, so hopefully one could get a sufficient amount of decent training data from existing open source Scala repos. \n I created a GitHub issue on the ScalaCenter Google Summer of Code repo as well, but Reddit might be a better place for brainstorming and discussion.\n Feel free to post any ideas, critique, proposals related to the topic here.\n    submitted by    /u/BrilliantArmadillo64  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I finally picked Scala 3 for my new product and I'd like to share some experience. Overall, it's a tool for reservations. Involves a bunch of CRUD. Nothing special or particularly challenging. The stack was classic \"spartan\": Tapir, ZIO, Quill, Circe, Cats...\n The good:\n Tapir folks nailed it! That's pretty much all I can say about them. ZIO also worked flawlessly. Quill was a pleasant surprise since it was the spot where I expected most of the obstacles. Although, the general documentation of Quill could be improved. E.g. in the context of structure, more examples, etc. But in all fairness, well done.\n The bad:\n Some things do not work quite well with new Scala features. E.g. a lot of hacking around various encoders and decoders for opaque types or enums. Some libraries are still not supported which is bonkers. E.g. I miss Scalamock and Cornichon.\n The ugly:\n Tooling. The neverending story... Let's begin with Metals. Metals is like a... musket. Sometimes it fires, sometimes it misfires, and sometimes explodes straight to your face. In a lot of cases, I had to kill its Java process, remove the target dir., and reimport the project. Funny enough, IntelliJ worked okish. With, few error reports when there are no actual errors. However, the experience is kind of clunkier than with Scala 2. Also, I noticed that sometimes incremental compilation doesn't work quite well and you can end up with some weird behavior.\n The unnecessary: \n Indentation syntax. I don't want to start a rant... especially if I start asking questions about how much time and resources this feature required. Especially, since Scala has much greater \"burning issues\". In all fairness, I didn't see any benefit from having this.\n To conclude: \n The experience was ok, spiced with some rough edges. From a Scala beginner's perspective, I presume it would be quite nasty. Overall, there's still a lot of work to do.\n    submitted by    /u/rom_romeo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried advising org-roam-node-at-point like this (code generated with chatgpt's help, apologies if anything is wrong; my elisp-fu is weak):\n ​\n (defun my-org-roam-node-at-point (&optional assert) \"Return the Org-roam node at point if it exists, or the node corresponding to the link at point.\" (interactive) (let ((id (plist-get (link-hint--get-link-at-point) :args))) (if (and id (string-prefix-p \"id:\" id)) (progn (print (substring id 3)) (org-roam-node-from-id (substring id 3))) (org-roam-node-at-point )))) (advice-add 'org-roam-node-at-point :override #'my-org-roam-node-at-point) \n This doesn't work, but it does succeed at breaking the roam-buffer, so I suspect an approach sort of like this could work, but I'm in over my depth.

As part of publishing, I export the notes as txt, insert them into an FTS5 SQLite table and I added a small reactive app to an existing server to search and display the results. Everything works well but I recently used docsify at work and thought it was superb so I started thinking about client-side searching. I've thought about the following:\n  \nmodify my export to markdown, generate the appropriate sidebar file and setup docsify in the normal way. My primary objection is the markdown exporter's quality is unknown. This would also cut my publish time down significantly and wouldn't be too much work.\n index the HTML (Note: getting this only do the relevant piece was difficult the last time I tried as tags and metadata blew up the results) as part of the publishing process and add a Javascript library that gets included in every exported HTML file. We'll call this the stork model. While slightly slower than the previous option, this would also reduce publishing time substantially.\n  \nWhat other solutions occur to you?\n edit: I ended up doing the first one.

          "description": "I've been messing with this problem for a while now, off and on for months, really, and it's driving me a little bit crazy, so here we are.\n The specific thing I'm trying to do is exit insert mode (modal editing, previously evil, currently trying meow) when I arrive back in the main org mode file after editing a src block. I'm not actually sure why I end up in insert mode sometimes when exiting src edit, but it happens often. Advising `org-edit-src-exit` is the place to be for this as far as I can tell, and that works when returning to the main org file.\n The problem I have is that editing a src block without calling `org-edit-special`, thus staying in the main org file, will also trigger the advice. Pressing RET, or using anything that makes a new line in the src block (like `meow-insert-above/below`) will call `org-edit-src-exit` and its advice, and I can't find any way to tell in the context of that advice whether the edit is happening in a special edit buffer or not. I'm guessing that editing src blocks without calling `org-edit-special` happens in a background buffer anyway so the process is indistinguishable?\n I've tried checking the major-mode before exiting the edit buffer, but it's always org-mode. I've tried using `org-in-src-block-p`, `org-src-edit-buffer-p`, checking `org-src-mode`, setting a local variable after `org-edit-special` that I can check in my advice, so many things that haven't worked.\n It's very possible that I'm missing something obvious, or there's a very different solution to my specific problem, but even if so, I'm still curious about how to distinguish these src block editing situations.

So if I have:\n #+PROPERTY: CATEGORY_ALL Value1 Value2 Value3 \n then ‘C-c C-x p’ (‘org-set-property’) ignores the list in CATEGORY_ALL.[1] Furthermore, neither ‘S-<RIGHT>’ (‘org-property-next-allowed-value’) nor ‘S-<LEFT>’ (‘org-property-previous-allowed-value’ pay attention to it either. In fact both of them respond with \"Allowed values for this property have not been defined\".\n Is that the expected behavior, or am I doing something wrong?\n [1] Org may well give a completion list, but only if CATEGORY has already been given values elsewhere in the file, and then the list consists of all those values, and it still ignores CATEGORY_ALL. And that list of pre-used values is not enforced, the way an _ALL list is.

I know I can do a two active schedule dates with some dashes to get it to show a span of time i.e. <date>--<date> . \n However I'd prefer if I could do some prefix / augmentation to the agenda like below. Imagine the prep of salads would take 2.5 hours and is marked with 2.5 hrs of effort. \n  Task: 18:30...... Scheduled: NEXT Prep Salads for Wed/Thurs/Fri |-> 19:00...... |-> 20:00...... |-> 21:00...... Reminder: 21:30...... Start Evening Wind Down Habit: 22:00......

And I've also sometimes put local file variables up there, right at the top, in a # -*- ... -* line.\n But when I put the buffer into column mode, those settings lines are messing up my view of things; in particular they are creating a gap between column view's column headers, and the various column-ized headings down below in the buffer proper.\n Is there a way to hide all that settings cruft so I get a cleaner view in column mode?

          "description": "Hello all,\n This is part of my effort to replace my three TiddlyWiki instances with org files. I've looked at a number of conversion tools written by others, and ended up rolling a small(-ish) Perl script to do about 90% of the conversion, from a JSON export of a given TW instance.\n The first TW instance I've converted is a journal of my scale modeling projects. In it, I have future projects, current projects, and completed projects. I would like it if the completed projects (all of which have a tag \"Completed\" on their level-1 headline) were folded. I read in the manual that adding :VISIBILITY: folded to the properties drawer would do this, but it didn't work for me. And, as I already have a tag unique to these headlines, it would be great if I could trigger this based on the tag.\n Is there a way to run elisp code when an org file is first opened, specific to a file, with which I could do this? I suppose it could be done with a hook, but I would likely want code to be specific to a given file. (That is, I might have a similar-but-different need in the other files I'm yet to convert.)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/rjray  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm pretty new to Emacs, so go easy on me if I'm missing something obvious, but I've read all of the documentation that I could find on running Emacs as a server and every time I think I've fixed the issue something strange happens again.\n I am on version 29. Currently, the way I start the daemon is with systemd. I enable and start the service as the documentation shows.\n The issue has to do with where the daemon creates the socket. Sometimes when I boot up my machine, everything works exactly as I expect it to: I can simply run `emacsclient -nc` and it pops right up. I can also set my shell environment variable EDITOR to emacsclient and open files easily that way. When things are working right, I note that the socket is in /run/user/userID/emacs/server.\n Probably half the time I boot up, the socket is in ~/.emacs.d/server/server, which means I have to pass the path to the socket to emacsclient for it to work. This means I have to change the scripts bound to my keybindings, etc., every time this happens. Pain in the butt. And for some reason I don't understand, setting EDITOR=emacsclient -cn -s /path/to/server doesn't work the way I want it to. It opens up a new frame, but does not open a buffer with the current file.\n So my questions more broadly are\n  \nHow does Emacs determine where it creates the socket? You would think it just looks at server-socket-dir, but there's obviously more to it than that, because it changes it up on me regardless of whether I explicitly set that variable.\n And does anybody have any hunches as to what could be causing it to seemingly randomly flip back and forth between socket locations?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Exact_Willingness_25  \n [link]   [comments]",

(The regular buffers can be chosen in the upper part of the consult-menu as usual.)\n What did I do wrong?\n  (setq consult-buffer-sources '(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer (:name \"Ephemeral\" :narrow 109 :category buffer :items (\"*Messages*\" \"*scratch*\" \"*Async-native-compile-log*\" \"*Bookmark List*\")))) (setq consult-buffer-filter '(\"\\\\` \" \"\\\\`\\\\*Completions\\\\*\\\\'\" \"\\\\`\\\\*scratch\\\\*\\\\'\" \"\\\\`\\\\*Messages\\\\*\\\\'\" \"\\\\`\\\\*Bookmark List\\\\*\\\\'\" \"\\\\`\\\\*EMMS-Log\\\\*\\\\'\" \"\\\\`\\\\*Flymake log\\\\*\\\\'\" \"\\\\`\\\\*Semantic SymRef\\\\*\\\\'\" \"\\\\`\\\\*tramp/.*\\\\*\\\\'\")) \n I need to filter them, so they are not listed twice, but just in the extra category.

I'm leaning more towards the latter, but I'm pretty new to Emacs so I just don't know (and can't reliably test this in my other, more powerful laptop).\n So what do you think?

These notes are spread over a lot of directories on my system and in different formats (.txt, .md, .doc). Migration to org-roam will make navigating through all of my notes much more comfortable and I already migrated most of my notes.\n The last notes I want to migrate have a \"directory context\". For instance holiday notes in my pictures directory. I am considering to copy/paste these files to org-roam and add a tag to the directory and delete the old note. The downside is that this is kinda an org-roam lock in, because migrating these notes back could be a PITA. If I use a special tag in the roam-note to the original directory then it is possible to migrate the files back with a simple elisp script I guess but could break when directories are renamed in the future. Hopefully I am making myself clear .\n Just before sending this to Reddit a light bulb went off. I could copy/paste the original note in the org-roam note in a code block and tangle it to this directory. I would prefer to not use a code block but something like this seems to be the way.\n How are you guys dealing with old \"directory context\" notes?\n    submitted by    /u/kolerezooi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Correct usage of define-key:\n  (define-key gnus-article-map (kbd \"i\") #'gnus-article-show-images) \n I frequently make the error where I think I am supposed to quote the keymap. I have to look up some old code to see, oh yeah, you don't quote the keymap.\n Then when I use use-package, I would write\n (use-package gnus :bind (:map gnus-article-map (\"i\" . gnus-article-show-images))) \n Now the function gnus-article-show-images is unquoted, I guess, because this is a macro? The structure of the arg list to :bind is unclear from the function documentation, so I just have to look up another example where I used :bind to figure out the format. Anther example, in general-define-key both keymap and function are quoted.

I am very new to emacs so please bear with me.\n ​\n I understand how to pass arguments to an elisp function.\n ​\n but not able to comprehend how to use it in conjunction with a list\n for example\n (interactive (list (read-shell-command (if shell-command-prompt-show-cwd (format-message \"Async shell command in `%s': \" (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)) \"Async shell command: \") nil nil (let ((filename (cond (buffer-file-name) ((eq major-mode 'dired-mode) (dired-get-filename nil t))))) (and filename (file-relative-name filename)))) current-prefix-arg shell-command-default-error-buffer ) ) \n i can understand what this code does, but because i dont understand how/what arguments the list will take e.g. `read-shell-command`/`current-prefix-arg`/`shell-command-default-error-buffer`/`read-string`\n i am having a hard time creating one myself.\n ​\n Can someone please explain this to me in a simple way?\n Also what all can i pass?\n ​\n i can think of command line arguments in couple of forms:\n  \nshell command\n string\n integer\n file\n buffers\n perfix\n  \netc.\n I am guessing there will be a particular form of these commands i should use.\n TIA\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/justrajdeep  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm thinking about installing Emacs (org-mode is the main selling point) and switching (at least from NeoVim) to Emacs/Doom Emacs. While I was reading about how to install it, I found that there are a couple of different emacs releases that can be installed: \n  \nIf I search Homebrew for the \"Emacs\" term, there is one cask called \"emacs\", let's call it \"standard\".\n But there is also \"emacs-plus\" which should be first tapped: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus?tab=readme-ov-file\n  \nI have a couple of questions: \n  \nI'm wondering what is the \"correct\" way to install emacs on MacBook Pro M1 with Sonoma - standard or plus release.\n If emacs-plus is the correct way should I include those additional flags like \"--with-native-comp\" and if yes which ones?\n If emacs-plus is the correct way, what is better to use \"emacs-plus@29\" or just use the latest version? I guess that if I just use the latest version, then it will be updated whenever I run brew update and upgrade, and I'm not sure how things are going in emacs world with those updates. I used to have problems with NeoVim updates, as well as plugin updates, so at one point in time, I was afraid to run plugin updates :) Hope Emacs is more stable.\n  \nThanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/milnik79  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I feel like this should be pretty obvious, but i'm pulling my hair out on the order of operations here.\n I want to customize some faces with a box. And i want that box to use a color from my current theme. But i don't want to hard code the color value, but for it to use the dark or light color of the modus theme, depending on which is loaded on starting.\n So far i have tried using the function modus-themes-get-color-value but it doesn't seem to be available at the point the tab-line gets activated. Then i tried this at the very end of my init.el:\n (custom-set-faces '(tab-line ((t (:box (:line-width (5 . 5) :color ,(face-background 'tab-line)))))) ) \n Which seems to be run before the theme is loaded, as i'm getting a white box on the modus-vivendi theme.\n I tried setting this up in a use-package statement for the tab-line-mode, for the modus theme and for the emacs pseudo package. I tried adding :after (modus-themes) to the use-package statement for the tab-line. All without success. I don't even want it to track the theme when i change it after starting emacs. Just, get the background of the tab-line at start, after the modus-theme is loaded and use that for the box color.\n I feel like i'm somehow overthinking this. How can i get the tab-line border to look right regardless of the configured theme? Is this a case of having to set up a variable for your theme and then making this into a cond statement with hardcoded Color Values? This should work for now, but would mean i'd have to rewrite the any time i want to change themes.\n Just for completeness, here's the entire config, if anyone want's to take a look:\n https://gitlab.com/domsch1988/domacs\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Have you ever thought to yourself, why should I give Emacs commands like a plebian, when an LLM can just control Emacs for me? Well the first step is now done, we now have a way to make any elisp command callable by an LLM that does function calling. For example, here is me switching buffers by telling the LLM to switch buffers by just describing the buffer I want switched to. It's not exactly a huge time-saver, but it's cool and shows the potential.\n ​\n https://i.redd.it/fy6jnbp2w1kc1.gif\n In my llm package, I've created a new function calling branch after learning that Ollama will soon support function calling. Right now both Open AI and Gemini do this (but Gemini has some limitations). As part of that, I have a utility to use function calling to create function definitions for elisp functions (which aren't really rich enough in information to be passed to function calls as-is).\n I'll be thinking about interesting new interactions that can be built off by having the LLM just control emacs via a few predefined commands. But it's quite useful for certain things where you want the LLM to produce structured information. For example, I created a function that will create an example sentence given a word in a language, and then it can be passed to anki, etc. These things were a bit painful to do previously.\n As normal, I'm not planning on creating an actual end-user package here, but I want to encourage people to think about what can be done using function calling and, if there is something you want to put into a package, use the `llm` package to make it easy and portable (somewhat). Ideas and feedback are most welcome!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I have been wondering if Emacs is on its way down.\n I guess it all started with the birth of NeoVim about a decade back. The project quickly grew and added features which made it better of an IDE than stock Vim (I think). Now i know Vim is not designed to be an IDE, but many NeoVim users seem to want that functionality. Today neovim has plugins t not only code and autocomplete, but also debug code in most languages. i lbelieve it has been steadily attracting users of stock Vim (and of course Emacs)\n Then enter, VSCode about 6 years ago. I guess this project attracted a lot of users from aother text editors (including Emacs). Today it has an extension for everything. Being backed by microsoft means its always going to be better.\n Now whenever I try to look up solutions for Emacs issues on the web, most posts i see are at least 10 years old. For example, I googled for turning Emacs into a web dev IDE. A lot of reddit and Stackoverflow posts that the search turned up were more than a decade old.\n I am wondering if Emacs is on a steady decline . The fact that it is not available by default on many systems seems to be an additional nail in its grave. Even on this sub, a lot of Emacs lovers who used to post regularly, like redguardfoo and Xah are no longer active\n This makes me sad. I absolutely hate having to install a browser disguised as a text editor (VS Code) which will be obsolete probably by another 5 years. I hope that Emacs stays around. Its infinite extensibility is what i love the most (and of course elisp) \n Would like to hear your thoughts\n    submitted by    /u/redditisinmyheart  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "🙏 Please toss an upvote on this issue—it needs 20 upvotes in 90 days to be merged. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204942\n Sometimes I use VS Code for work, to understand a plugin, and just to explore.\n Window splitting in VS Code drives me nuts. Window management is too closely tied up with tabs. You end up with an hierarchy of \"Editor Groups\" and \"Editors\" instead of being able to recall any buffer wherever you want. Then Quick Open (buffer switcher) opens a file multiple times—one per Editor Group. Using VS Code's `revealIfOpen` option partially addresses this, but reveals in the previous Editor Group—it can't recall the file into the Editor Group your cursor is currently in like in Emacs.\n We added `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` to fix this. This allows you to make VS Code work just like Emacs buffers. Here are the docs for the Get Started page in VS Code docs:\n ### Simulating Buffers\n If you're coming from buffer-centric editors such as Emacs or vi, you can emulate that workflow with:\n \"workbench.editor.showTabs\": \"single\",\n \"workbench.editor.revealIfOpen\": true,\n \"workbench.editor.revealIfOpenInActiveGroup\": true,\n \"workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups\": false,\n VS Code has a model where Editors live hierarchically within Editor Groups, and to split your screen you must use Editor Groups. Using `revealIfOpen` with `revealIfOpenInActiveGroup` causes Quick Open to move already-open Editors into the active Editor Group. This allows you to emulate buffer-centric environments—no tabs, split your screen, and you can view any Editor within any Editor Group without opening a file multiple times.\n PR (with video!): https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/205442\n Issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204942\n Docs PR: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/7043\n    submitted by    /u/aguynamedben  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This question is not emacs-specific, but I have a feeling that this technical crowd might know a path forward given how customizable emacs is.\n My new work role requires me to spend even more time in email. We use Office 365 / Exchange for our work email, so the Outlook desktop client and the webmail interface is my default interface. Often times, I send an email to a recipient, and wait for their response. The chance that they respond is low, so I always have to send a follow up note. Take this and multiply by 100 threads, which takes up a lot of my time to stay on top of things.\n What I would like to do is set up my follow-up email, and have the note sent out on a certain date if I haven't heard back yet. If the person responds before the date, the pre-written note should never be sent and could be discarded. Outlook email rules and delay send feature does not allow for such a complex scenario.\n I am aware of the Boomerang app for Gmail and Outlook, but I don't think the cost is worth it; and I don't think corporate would allow me to install that add-in in Outlook.\n I looked into Thunderbird as it has a \"send later\" plugin that appears to have a scripting component, which could probably work. However, I'm unable to get my work mail account to work with Thunderbird. I could probably try some more to figure out why it isn't working.\n Question for the folks in this subreddit: is there a way to achieve the email rules I described using an email client in Emacs? Or some other open source tool?\n I know this is a long shot. Thanks in advance for any insight you might provide.\n    submitted by    /u/vinhdizzo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't think this is necessarily specifically an LSP issue, but probably some combination of things, like maybe LSP is getting confused and issuing too many requests? I have already gone through all the recommendations in `lsp-doctor` and I'm a little uncertain where to even look to diagnose further (the `*lsp-log*` doesn't contain anything illuminating) and the problem seems to get worse and worse.\n Is this a common experience? How can I see better what's going on? Any packages I should maybe look for and jettison?\n    submitted by    /u/aghull  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, with the variable calendar-setup set to two-frames, it creates two new frames, one for the calendar and one for the diary.\n This isn't the only command like this, it's just an example, and it's not even the only one I might like to solve, since I face a similar problems with some gnus workflows I want to build, so please, no specific hacks to get this particular thing to work such as suggesting I not use calendar-setup set to two-frames, I really need a generalisable solution to this.\n So the issue is, if I launch emacsclient -e '(calendar)' from a shortcut or the command-line in order to bring up my calendar, this doesn't work unless there is a pre-existing emacsclient frame.\n The solution then would seem to be to issue either emacsclient -c -e '(calendar)' or emacsclient -r -e '(calendar)' in order to create a frame first.\n The problem is this creates a totally useless frame that is both annoying, but also problematic, because you can't close it if the calendar and diary frames aren't already closed.\n What I'd like is to be able to run (calendar) and have it create its frames without the need for a pre-existing frame. Or else in a really bad pinch, have the dummy frame created but totally hidden, and have it quit the moment I close the diary and calendar frames.\n Does anybody have any ideas?

See, I didn’t know this but whenever you refile, when it says getting all targets, it’s opening them up (at least it did in my ibuffer behind the scenes).\n To counter this, I asked an AI to help me, and it did. It wrote the code but it couldn’t get the last part right about not opening ibuffer to kill everything. I fixed that up myself. So this is a collaboration between an AI and me, but the code works.\n The only “issue” now is that if you have a lot of targets, it will take a few seconds each time to do the gathering part.

So I would like to be able to have my widget 'UI', and load the data from the yaml file interactively, so that I can save back to it as well.\n I've been trying to find the source code for the customize buffer in emacs, which does essentially what I want to do, but my grepping has been to no avail.\n    submitted by    /u/UnChilledIndividual  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I've declared emacs init bankruptcy and am starting over.\n I've installed the latest stable version of emacs (29.2) and am using an init.el generated by https://emacs.amodernist.com/\n I am not sure this is the latest and greatest kind of init, I notice it does not use any use-package\n One big change between then and now is the introduction of the nongnu repository and I see that it's automatically listed in the package-archives of emacs 29.2.\n What's it state?\n Do I need melpa at all?\n If I do need melpa for packages not yet in gnu or nongnu, how do I add melpa in so that it's priority is last on the list?\n Right now I have:\n (require 'package) (add-to-list 'package-archives '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.org/packages/\") t) (setq package-archive-priorities '((gnu . 10) (nongnu . 5) (melpa . 1))) \n But even so, when I m-x list-packages I can see that emacs wants to upgrade the nongnu packages to the ones in melpa.\n As an example\n the version of the avy package in melpa is 20230420.404\n but in nongnu the version is 0.5.0\n  \nWhen installing packages, the package with the highest version number from the archive with the highest priority is selected. When higher versions are available from archives with lower priorities, the user has to select those manually.\n Archives not in this list have the priority 0, as have packages that are already installed. If you use negative priorities for the archives, they will not be upgraded automatically.\n  \nSince the version numbers of nongnu and melpa differ so widely, it seems as if there is no way to just set package archive priority such that it will default to nongnu\n Any advice?\n Suggestions on using melpa or not?\n Suggestions if using melpa how to get it to be used only when packages are not found in gnu or nongnu?\n    submitted by    /u/DenebianSlimeMolds  \n [link]   [comments]",

One for the input data (col1, col2) and one for the calculated data (col3, col4)\n I tried it like this\n #+TBLNAME: data | col1 | col2 | | test | 1 | | test2 | 5 | | test3 | 4 | | col3 | col4 | | | | | -4 | 6 | | 1 | 9 | #+TBLFM: @3$1..@>$1=remote(data,@-1$2)-remote(data,@0$2)::@3$2..@>$2=remote(data,@-1$2+@0$2) \n But it throws an error that \"Row descriptor -1 leads outside table\".

I really like the non-hierarchical approach where individual notes are org-mode headers (or files) with an ID property that I can simply link to.\n Org-ql is fantastic at querying org-mode headers, keeping dynamic blocks based on those queries, etc. Using org-ql, I can also query for links within a heading. What I am missing is the option to query for backlinks TO the heading. Has anyone solved this problem?\n ​\n Simple example:\n * Drug A :drug: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 12345 :END: This is an inhibitor of [[id:54321][Protein X]]. * Protein X :protein: :PROPERTIES: :ID: 54321 :END: This is a trans-membrane protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer. \n If I'm interested in the a subset of inhibitor drugs that are linked to Protein X I can do:\n [[org-ql-search:(and (rifle \"inhibitor\") (link \"Protein X\"))]] \n But what about finding trans-membrane proteins are associated with (i.e. \"backlinked to\") inhibitors?\n ​\n OR - maybe there is a way to use org-ql results as org-ql query inputs? For example: \n  \nQuery 1: pull out all drugs.\n Query 2: pull out all proteins.\n Query 3: identify all proteins (from Query 2) that have a backlink to drugs (from Query 1).\n  \n​\n I'm a bit stuck.

This is all reflected in Apple Mail in iOS and on the Mac as well. However, the Sent Mail doesn't seem to sync in the same way. If I send an email with Mu4e, it will save it to the designated \"icloud/Sent Messages\" locally, and I can see it in mu4e. But I can't see it in Apple Mail at all. It's simply not synced. All the other folders are except for this one. Also, Sent items from Apple Mail do not sync to mu4e either.\n Is there something that I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/TyrionBean  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Two of the first packages I setup in emacs when I began using it were projectile and perspective. I primarily use emacs as an IDE and wanted to be able to manage different projects. Google said these were good so I started there. Two months on and I still don't have a single perspective set and projectile feels like I'm using a semi truck to tow a hand cart. I've only not removed projectile because it integrates with tree-macs and I'm hoping to set it up so that I can have tree-macs display my list of folders when I'm not working on a project and only the project root of the current working directory when I'm in a python/c++ project. Tree-macs has a variable that allows you to set it to display a single directory and I'm wondering if that can be done with a .dir-local.el file, eliminating the one thing I think would make projectile worth having. I'd also like to exclude folders with .gitignore but again, I wonder if there is a way to do that with tree-macs or project.el.\n So, my question. What do you guys use perspective and projectile for. As a hobby programmer, do you think it's worth having? What are your thoughts on project.el and what else is out there?\n    submitted by    /u/Usual_Office_1740  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried looking for guides, but I haven't found information on how to structure the code of a coherent package.\n Particularly, it's been hard for me to keep track of the code in my mind because I'm using mostly plain functions and not many data structures. And the code is so far in one big file, which I don't know how to split up, as opposed to classes, which are more conceptually modular. How should I make my code more modular? How should I decide when I need to make a new function?\n If I need to visit and insert text into a buffer, should the visit and insert be done at the lowest, i.e. most nested, level possible? Or should I wrap the whole function body in a with-current-buffer?\n If I find myself needing to store a lot of data in variables, am I doing it wrong? I'm not using setq, because it seems like overkill and ugly being global, but even with let and let*, keeping track of what variables have been declared and their scope is getting difficult.\n Should I not declare as many variables and instead make monolithic functions where variable's aren't assigned, rather you just evaluate an expression (xyz) inside the expression you would pass the variable to, i.e. (abc (xyz)) instead of (setq var (xyz)) then (abc var)?

I often use smerge and 3-way diffing in git projects, that helps a bit to see things in context, but not always.\n For my stupid brain, this is an accessibility problem\n Here's the solution I have in mind: to tweak how diff tools show both sides so that the versions have more meaningful names.\n Exmaples:\n  \nMerging foo into main, it'd be nice if the label reads \"changes to be applied from foo\" and \"base from main\".\n Rabasing banana onto divergent recipes, with the shared ancestor main, it'd be great if it reads \"changes from banana\" and \"commonality from main\" and \"difference from main in recipes\".\n  \nIf you know a diff viewer, conflict resolution tool, whatever that allows this and how one might approach this, pointers would be appreciated!

But still can't find how to set that up. \n I might try pointing Rmail to the Maildir back up too, but just like IMAP, it is a one way conversion so I figured I would ask in case I destroy that synced copy for nothing :) \n Thank you!\n PS: I would try Maildir as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Mailbox-Formats.html\n    submitted by    /u/sebhoagie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like something a little more in line with FOSS/Libre ideals.\n I've been on SourceHut for a while and I really like that there is 0 Javascript—it's fast, reliable, and has worked well so far. Trouble is, collaboration is a little trickier as it's all via mailing lists right now. I've appreciated learning about mailing lists and I have had some people collaborate with me on some software via email—so cool!—but I know this is a blocker for some people. Also, it's technically still in alpha; I know Prot recently left SourceHut due to some missing features, and I kind of look up to Prot's deliberate approach to all things development.\n An alternative I'm considering is Forgejo. (The Codeberg instance, specifically.) They seem to have similar goals in regards to free software and portability, but the workflow is much more PR-based, which is much more comfortable for many users.\n I'm curious to hear people's opinions on the two forges: where do you like developing software?

Like I still don't know how to set custom font for Emacs client or solaire mode doesn't work for some reason despite using themes that support it, not a big deal but it'd be nice to make them work. Now I'm thinking whether is it better to polish my current config so I have everything set up exactly how I want or to use some distribution that makes it all easier. I know it's pretty much matter of preferences, but it's hard to make a decision by myself not knowing what I miss from Doom/Spacemacs nor what trade-offs there are + I already have somehow functional config and I don't know if at this point making a switch is a right move.\n And, despite I'm ex hardcore Vim user I don't use evil-mode in Emacs (I mostly do program in Lisp languages in which Vim keybinding is just useless thanks to structural editing and paredit), but I know both of these distribution use evil-mode by default.

          "description": "ekg is a note taking package that is tag-based, and uses sqlite for storage. The new version 0.5.0 is out, featuring the following major changes:\n  \nInline tags! Now you can just add tags as you type, which I find very convenient. The tags are, in org-mode, turned into org-mode links, so those who like this style of having links in one note that enable \"backlinks\" will find this more familiar. The backlinks here are just the tag showing the notes that have the link to that tag.\n \nekg-auto-save, a module by Qingshui Zheng that let's you enable saving notes automatically as you write them, which works in a similar way to the emacs auto-save functionality. If you write longer notes, this should be useful.\n \nImprovements to org-mode notes. Because of the way our notes buffer works, it has metadata at the top which has read-only elements that interfere with org-mode. We now have some ability to narrow the buffer before the appropriate org-mode commands so that they work correctly. But this solution isn't perfect, and more work needs to be done. \n \nTrash simplification - I previously had the notion that trashing a note should trash the individual tags, prepending them all with \"trash/\". That idea never really panned out, and was adding too much complication, so now there's just a \"trash\" tag. If your note has that tag, it's in the trash.\n \nAborting a note. If you are capturing a note, save it as a draft, but then want to just abandon both the note and the draft, you can do that with C-c C-k. Also thanks to Qingshui Zheng!\n \nMany bug fixes.\n \n Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKQB686SHQs\n    submitted by    /u/ahyatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm now trying to set up the daemon for emacs-macport.\n What I've gathered so far:\n - Opening emacs GUI and doing m-x start-server make the process be attached to that OS Window and, when it is closed, it all dies together.\n - running /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon gives me the terminal output I would expect when starting the daemon and a process, but when I try to emacsclient -cn, it opens a terminal emacs, not a GUI.\n Daemon start command output:\n Starting Doom Emacs in daemon mode! Initializing org-roam database... Clearing removed files... Clearing removed files...done Processing modified files... Processing modified files...done Copilot agent started. Starting Emacs daemon. Doom loaded 285 packages across 47 modules in 5.113s \n - when using the launchctl, as indicated in the wiki (with the modifications to emacs' path, and --fg-daemon), it starts the process with the same output as above. But, when trying to emacsclient -cn it gives me *ERROR*: Terminal type xterm-kitty is not defined. Doing export TERM=xterm does fix that, but it still opens a (rather very bugged) terminal frame.\n - Lastly, I tried creating an Emacs.app via Automator, but when invoked, it gives me the error could not get terminal name, which, I suppose, comes from the fact it is trying to open in a terminal, not GUI.\n TL;DR: It seems I've managed to open the server, but not to open a GUI frame.

          "description": "What kinds of buffers do you wish you could bookmark in Emacs that you can't usefully bookmark already? Emacs can of course bookmark specific locations in regular text files, but also several types of non-file buffers: dired, eshell, Man, eww, Info, help, image, vc-dir, doc-view, possibly others. Are there any others you'd like to be able to bookmark?\n Here are some ideas:\n  \noccur and grep buffers (jumping to the bookmark would rerun the search).\n \nREPLs. I can imagine this being useful: you bookmark a Python REPL and later jumping to the bookmark starts a new REPL and reruns all the import statements you had run before (or maybe just reruns everything?, or everything marked with a special comment?)\n \nshells. The eshell bookmarks are great, and that's what I use, but not everyone uses eshell. A shell bookmarker should preserve the current directory and whether you were ssh'ed into some other computer.\n \nShell command output buffers, the bookmarks should rerun the command. Same for compilation buffers (revert-buffer already knows how to rerun the compilation!).\n \n I'd love to see some more ideas for missing bookmark capabilities.\n    submitted by    /u/oantolin  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I have a function which runs (previous-line) (beginning-of-line 1) and said function is bound to a key (let's say <up>).\n So I apply a text-property of 'invisible using (pos-bol) of the first line and (1+ (pos-eol)) in order to get the first line to disappear, like it's not even there.\n If I'm on line 3 and M-: my function, it does what I'd expect and (point) will return the (pos-bol) of the second line. But, if I execute my function by pressing <up> from line 3, (point) keeps returning back 1, the point of the beginning of line 1 rather than the point at the beginning of line 2.\n Is this expected behavior? I'd be less weirded out if running code through M-: gave back similar results but I get what I'd expect to happen no matter what code I run and only the unexpected behavior when running the exact same code via a key binding.\n This seems to happen even when running Emacs with -Q. Also occurs when I try with (backward-char) and C-b: so long as it's the first line – at the top of the buffer – which is invisible, there's a difference between executing code by itself vs. via key commands (with the latter putting me at point 1, every time).\n    submitted by    /u/blah1998z  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone!\n Long-time Emacs user (this is my 8th year!) and lurker on this sub. I use Emacs for *nearly* everything. Coding, reading, writing, RSS, ToDos, knowledge base, website, music etc.\n So, I'm juggling Emacs on a bunch of different setups: a Linux machine with Ubuntu at home, a RHEL workstation and a node I ssh into at work, a MacOS laptop, a few Raspberry Pis. You see where this is going. Each has different uses, but some core things that I like to keep consistent.\n With the mix of OSX, Ubuntu, RHEL, plus the GUI and TTY variations, I need to change my Emacs config on every machine (even though a lot stays the same across the board).\n The real headache starts when I change something on one machine, and I want to apply that to all (or some) of the other machines. Yak shaving and all...\n Right now, my setup's built around an init.el that loads up a settings.org file, which has my literate config. The way I deal with some things (for example, remapping key bindings on MacOS) is by wrapping it up with conditionals. But it's looking quite ugly and is more annoying to maintain.\n I wonder what the best approach here is. Split my config into multiple files and load them as needed depending on where I am? Maybe mess around with Git branches for different setups? (And how would I even start with that?) Git submodules?\n Are there some tools that already deal with this? I am sure this is not an Emacs-only problem.\n Thanks in advance and would love to hear how you deal with this :)\n    submitted by    /u/I3lind5pot  \n [link]   [comments]",

Github for sure, and Gitlab as well, but also self-hosted Gitlab instances work perfectly well!\n I can review pull requests, easily add comments and of course pull all the changes from that PR to my local Git repository. For me, the best part is however just opening the right repo in the web browser. That way I can easily see CI pipeline status in seconds.\n Setting up a Magit forge is little bit of work. But it really pays off. Totally recommend.\n By the way, I noticed that in Github Magit has 427 supporters and in LiberaPay 130. I like round numbers a lot more.

For example I have a tasks note that displays all my open tasks. And I have a homelab note, that lists all ideas and tasks with the metadata \"subject:: homelab\" under headings for ideas and tasks. Also the list of completed tasks in the daily note is auto populated with tasks that have the completed date set to today.\n Now I'm trying to do something similar with org-roam. \n TL;DR: I want to query my org-roam notes for specific data that is marked with metadata and display it in other notes\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/ZunoJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe some of can weigh in on which path is \"worth\" following.\n Basically, i come from vim and neovim. I've worked with emas and neovim in parallel for years now. I generally enjoy the \"regular\" emacs keybindings for UI stuff. But i feel like i'm lossing a LOT of editing power when leaving evil behind. Yet, getting it to work consistently is a bunch of work and it'll always be 99% at best.\n Now the relevant part. I'm pretty sure i've only scratched the surface of emacs native keybinds. What i find missing is \"simple\" stuff like \"delete between paranthesis\" or \"duplicate this line\". Is this something emacs can \"just do\" and i just haven't found it yet?\n I see 2 ways forward:\n  \nStick with evil and invest the time to create consistent remaps where evil-collection and others don't quite do it.\n Stick to emacs and remap/write functionality i'm missing from vim\n  \nNote that ergonomics are a secondary thought. I have a custom keyboard so arrow keys are still on hjkl and modifiers are on thumbkeys. I'm also not married to the idea of modal editing. In fact, i enjoy not having to worry about modes and just \"type away\". But deleting/changing a specified area is just something i haven't found a good solution in emacs to.\n So, thoughts? Is what i'm missing from emacs just there and i need to find it, or am i better of investing fully into evil and making that work?\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

This was the moment where I put myself in trouble.\n Firstly, I was really productive on macOS and using the CMD key in combination with the arrows to move around on the line, quickly select and all of that. These are the moves that I'm missing more on, coming back to Linux.

          "description": "Probably it's been asked many times, still, I'm not sure which way should I go.\n I'm hungarian, and my solution to write hungarian in emacs (which I have barely done) was that I just simply typed \"auoeiuo\" instead of \"áúüű....\".\n Lately I started to have the need to write text for others, so using the correct vowels with \"umlauts\" became needed more and more often. It would be amazing if I could just simply switch layout and go on with my life not fighting with my muscle memory. Most often I still use us layout, not only because of the shortcuts, but also typing special characters like \\, [], etc... on hungarian layout really a pain in the ass. On hungarian layout I will almost never use any \"programming characters\", I'm pretty sure.\n The problem I have for example is that \"C-_\" is \"C-Ü\" or \"C-y\" is \"C-z\" on hungarian layout, which doesn't work anymore. I don't want to learn different combinations, neither fighting my muscle memory every time when once a week I want to write some longer hungarian text in emacs.\n I have a feeling that there could be a trick that any time i'm using a different layout, (and probably I should also put a condition that I'm in txt mode for not mess up things like dired or magit), emacs would interpret my keystrokes differently when I hold down C or M. So I would use the same key for typing a single \"ü\" and \"C-_\" for example.\n What could be the simplest way to set up emacs like that? Can you post me a link where it's already answered? I'm pretty sure it's been answered a couple of times, I'm just too stupid to find it.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/paadam94  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I don't want that. I actually *want* the Org text formatted with the auto-fills, just as it would be if I wasn't creating something for input on the web.\n So, is there a simple way (maybe using export? ) to have the newlines that are not needed (I'm thinking it's only newlines within a paragraph) replaced with what is almost certainly going to be a simple inter-word space? Note , though, that it isn't just going to be the newline that needs to go, but also any following indenting whitespace characters used to correctly position the next piece of text.\n For example, I'd like to have this:\n  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented.  converted to:  1. A line of text 2. Another line of text but this one is long enough to need to be wrapped. And notice that this portion is indented. \n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I've been trying for the past month or so to get Emacs working reliably and quickly on my High DPI linux machines, but have been struggling.\n Currently I am running into issues with a machine running Manjaro + GNOME (wayland) and the pgtk version of emacs 29.1. When I scale the frame to take up the entirety of my 4k display, I have noticeable input lag, likely in the 100s of ms. When I shrink the frame down, my input lag decreases significantly, and emacs feels snappy. The issue persists when I run emacs with emacs -q.\n At the moment I've resorted to running emacs 29.1 without pgtk, forcing it to run under XWayland. This causes emacs to render at a lower resolution to XWayland, resulting in blurry text when it's finally displayed on my monitor, but results in emacs staying snappy even at full screen.\n I've run into this issue across all my machines, across distros (namely Void, Arch, and Fedora), whenever I try to run Emacs full screen on a 4K monitor attached to a machine running Wayland. Switching to X isn't an option due to the excessive screen tearing that I get at high resolutions.\n Weirdly, compiling and running Emacs on my Windows work machine natively results in the best emacs experience I've had so far, with input feeling extremely snappy and fluid. I don't experience the scaling issues there. Emacs also is working fantastic on an old low resolution laptop that I have running Void with XFCE.\n I've tried adjusting the double buffering as mentioned in this post without success: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zgp6kw/gui_emacs_weird_the_bigger_the_frame_size_is_the/\n Any thoughts? Is this a thing that people are running into on high resolution displays with Wayland? Is XWayland the best bet right now?\n    submitted by    /u/sunmoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

The general #image  becomes → #uiimage on iOS, #nsimage on macOS, which are actual types in the macOS API.\nI removed the topic tag #appkit which doesn't tell me anything interesting here.\nWhy is the object tag #appkit useless now? Almost all my programming notes are about macOS and thus #appkit, the macOS UI API framework. So it doesn't help find anything, and it'd produce so many notes that it becomes useless. Thousands, if applied consistently!\nThere are notes about the AppKit framework as a topic. These stay put, of course!\nThe thing is: for my very first notes on programmatic image manipulation, it sounded sensible to use a tag like #image.  After all, I did not expect to need specificity here at all: \"something with image in Appkit\" sounded good. But with expertise, I need NSImage-related resources, and I can name contexts better. Like embedding images in text views, as wirh The Archive \nAll notes are malleable, so no problem.\nBy the way, new notes on similar topics I tag with the very specific API titles right away, e.g. #nsimage for image stuff on Mac. This changed in the past couple of years and I don't have to think about this, at all. I believe it felt similar back when I used the \"\"\"bad\"\"\" tag. So chances are I could discover even more specific tags in the future and find the current one lacking   At the moment, it's the best topic tag I know to describe this.",

          "description": "Hey everyone! I'm Binny, originally from India but currently living in Lisbon. I'm a Software Engineer(web dev, full stack) by profession.\nI discovered Zettelkasten in 2020 when I started working on a rather large personal project called MindOS. I was trying to create content in the intersection of philosophy, psychology, programming and rationality. During the research phase, I understood that it was going to be impossible to keep all of this in my mind - even with the note taking method that I used at that stage. I needed a better system.\nThis search led me to Zettelkasten, and I immediately fell in love with it! Since then I have actively trying to encourage others to use it as well. To do this, I have written tutorials, videos, created a couple of tools, etc. But my biggest and most resent contribution is a book I wrote and published a few months back: Zettelkasten and the Art of Knowledge Management.\nMy Zettelkasten Process...\nI have 2 vaults. Everything I learn that is useful for others go into Obsidian - and I publish it as a Digital Garden at https://notes.binnyva.com\nAll my personal information goes into a Logseq graph. This includes...\nJournals\nProject Management\nFleeting notes\nand the kitchen sink ;-)",
