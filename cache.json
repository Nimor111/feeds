The website also has functionality to search across multiple streamly packages.\n This release did a major revamp of the API to make it easier to comprehend and less error prone to use. Now there is a single \"Stream\" type instead of the polymorphic \"IsStream\" type class. There are explicit concurrency combinators to enable concurrent behavior on the same type instead of using different types for that purpose.\n Dependency on GHC rewrite rules has been removed for more robust behavior and better programmer control, though it required splitting the stream type into the default direct-style type \"Stream\" and the CPS type \"StreamK\".\n The package has been split into two, streamly-core intends to depend only on boot libraries (currently has some more deps due to backward compatibility), streamly provides higher level functionality like concurrency.\n Parser functionality has been released. Parsers fuse with streams and are compatible with folds i.e. parsers are folds with more power.\n See the following docs for more details:\n  \nChangelog\n Upgrade guide\n  \nYour feedback is important to us we did the API revamp based on the feedback from users.\n    submitted by    /u/hk_hooda  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I wanted to write the haskell equivalent of the intentionally wrongly written fibonnaci code below and I realised I just probably...can't?\n void fib (int a, int b, int n) {\n if( n <= 0) return;\n if(b <= 0 ){\n printf(\"%d \", a);\n printf(\"%d \", b + 1);\n fib (a, b + 1, n-2);\n } \n //bruh block\n int c = a + b;\n printf(\"%d \", c);\n fib (b, c, n - 1 );\n } \n int main( ) {\n fib( 0, 0, 5); \n }\n in this code, i've intentionally left the bruh block of code independent of the block above,i.e., not bind it to the previous if block using an else and that obviosuly produces a output different from the expected fibonacci one. I tried building the haskell equiavlent using guards and if-else-thens and in the process i realised there's probably no way to build a freely floating independent block of code in a function that has other conditionals in haskell???....Or is there a way to do it?\n    submitted by    /u/changuchakkaram  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Seeing people publishing their Tic Tac Toe games here, I decided to show my fully functional, documented, local 3D chess game written in Haskell. A quick glance at the software stack and features:\n  \nVulkan for the rendering.\n The package effectful to keep the game logic independent from orthogonal aspects like logging, window handling, memory management and debugging.\n The package apecs for the overall game architecture.\n GLTF for importing 3D models from Blender.\n Features include moving pieces, 3D rotation, smooth zooming, a skybox, lighting and jumping knights :-)\n  \nAs you will recognize in the linked repository, the chess game is merely a running example of a larger endeavour: while implementing the game, I separated the reusable parts of the game into separate packages. The result of this process is hagato (Haskell Gamedev Toolkit), a collection of loosely coupled, easily combinable sub-libraries which can be used or ignored as desired, thus allowing developers to select features and technologies at will while remaining in full control of the overall game architecture. It makes use of the new cabal feature which allows one to put multiple public libraries into a single package.\n I published some additional packages on Hackage while implementing the game: apecs-effectful for integrating apecs into effectul, resource-effectful for managing resources in effectful, and chessica which implements the pure chess logic used in the 3D game.\n However, the chess game was just a testbed, to be honest. My overall goal is to use hagato now to implement the game I wanted to build in the first place, but I cannot share any details yet.\n    submitted by    /u/typedbyte  \n [link]   [comments]",

The corresponding functor laws are:\n traverse pure = pure -- purity law traverse (f <=< g) = traverse f <=< traverse g \n The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn't hold in general.

As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO.

For example:\n  \nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.6.5/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#t:Query\n https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-0.24/docs/Aws-DynamoDb-Commands-Query.html#t:Query\n  \nWhich means that the following will not typecheck:\n import qualified Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query import qualified Database.PostgreSQL.Simple test2 :: Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query.Query test2 = (undefined :: Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Query) \n Hence my question: given the Haddocks for two datatypes with the same name, is there a way to tell if they're the same?\n    submitted by    /u/runeks  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's known that this is an approximation - for example, it ignores bottom values. But I want to talk about another way in which it fails to match the Haskell type system.\n In Hask, we can talk about an object representing Int, one representing Bool, one representing (Int, Bool), one representing Either Int Bool, etc.\n However, this only handles the structural types in Haskell. Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age = Age Int or newtype Count = Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.\n But how would one distinguish which one is which?\n If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?\n One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.\n But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type? You could end up with the same name being paired with two different types.\n    submitted by    /u/qseep  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to be able to animate reduction graphs and include math symbols.\n The interactivity could be as simple as slowing/speeding the animation, and allowing for automatic \"stop points\", like a slide show. Or it could go as far as to allow the content to be dynamically generated by user input. And perhaps people could click on graph nodes and see them expand.\n Reanimate sounds almost ideal, with its support for LaTeX. But unfortunately, it is all rendered in batch, not providing for any interactivity.\n FRP solutions sound very attractive. But reflex seems to be stuck on the outdated GHCJS, and I haven't been able to get it to build (using macOS on Apple Silicon). The newer JS output in GHC doesn't yet have DOM support. And even if I used one of those, figuring out how to interact with a LaTeX renderer might be tricky.\n The diagrams library supports some animation, but it's limited, and the never-seems-to-be-arriving version 2.0 is supposed to replace the animation support with something new.\n Another closely related option is Purescript, which seems to have a few FRP libraries, but I'm not sure how well any of them will work for this application.\n Another option would be to use or interface with a JavaScript library that does interactive animations, such as paper.js or Greensock.\n I figure that depending on the animation, pre-rendering some content may be desirable for performance, and that could be tricky.\n I'm leaning toward using Reanimate because, even though I have to give up on interactivity, it seems to have excellent support for LaTeX integration.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n So I'm trying to model collectible coins using Haskell, and I've hit a bit of a roadblock with figuring out the best approach.\n Basically, each coin has a denomination, year, and mint. However, not all combinations of these three are valid. For example, a coin with denomination GR1 from the year 1923 could only have come from the Warsaw mint. On the other hand, the same denomination in a different year might belong to the Paris mint.\n My initial thought was to enforce these constraints using a smart constructor, but since this is a pet project aimed at learning, I would prefer to check it at compile time if possible.\n Here's the model I've come up with so far:\n data Denomination = ZL10 | ZL5 | ZL2 | ZL1 | GR50 | GR20 | GR10 | GR5 | GR2 | GR1 deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum) data Mint = Warsaw | Paris | Birmingham deriving (Eq, Show, Bounded, Enum) type family OneOf xs where OneOf '[] = Not IdPred OneOf (x : xs) = Or (EqualTo x) (OneOf xs) type Years a = Refined (OneOf a) Year newtype Year = Year {getYear :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, TextShow, Show, Lift) type GR1EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR2EmissionYears = Years '[1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR5EmissionYears = Years '[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] -- [...] \n I could of course glue it all into a single union type, listing all the cases explicitly:\n data Coins = Gr1Warsaw1937 | Gr1Paris1937 | Gr1Paris1939 - ... \n But that will make it quite hard to e.g. filter and extract all coins of year 1937.\n I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this problem. Do I need dependent types for this? Is there any simpler way?\n    submitted by    /u/onliner10  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most serialisation formats are something like that.\n Think of it as a \"serialisation/deserialisation\" description AST.\n Indeed I would think if I had such a structure, I would think I'd be able to define \"ToJSON\", \"FromJSON\" and \"ToSwagger\" instances from it, and perhaps others in the future. If I get them right once, then I can provide APIs/docs in different formats and know they'll be in sync for all serialisation/deserialisation formats.\n Has this idea been attempted in a library?

I have read that sometimes most parentheses are ommitted and that the abstraction chooses its body greedily, that is, extends itself as far right as possible. My idea is:\n  \nThe expression itself is a (not proper) subexpression\n The first lambda body extends over all the remaining symbols (?) meaning that we have an abstraction of the form λa. M where M a subexpression.\n M itself is an application again (λ b. a b) a\n a is a subexpression of M\n (λ b. a b) is another one\n Lastly, this is λ b. M' for some M' which in this case is a b.

          "description": "Hi, I've been using Scala on the backend for a many years and like many of us, I use Future for concurrency.\n But, I'm trying to understand why would I use Future in ScalaJS (just started learning) with JS being single threaded.\n One use-case I found is:\n I wrote a test website in ScalaJS with two links using ScalaTags. Each link/page randomly does a heavy computation and then renders a simple but very long HTML. I want to display a spinner when I click on either of the hyperlinks, until the computation ends and the dom is rendered. Without Future, on clicking either of the hyperlinks the page takes a while to update the dom, it kinda halts the browser, and then it renders my big azz ScalaTags HTML. The spinner does not get displayed (I toggle between display = none & display = block).\n But, when I set the dom to display the spinner in a Future, and then call the render function in another Future for the page clicked using QueueExecutionContext, now, I can see the spinner. \n Kinda weird! JS is still single threaded so why would the use of Future result in different behavior?\n Does this also mean that I should be using Future whenever I'm updating the dom?\n    submitted by    /u/Expensive-Photo7425  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I do have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with:\n ​\n 1) What technology stack should I consider?\n ​\n After careful consideration, I have made the decision to use tapir and http4s for my projects. However, I am currently torn between ZIO and Cats. Personally, I am leaning towards ZIO as it seems to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly effect system. Nevertheless, I am aware that Typelevel/Cats is more widely adopted in the industry. Could you please advise me on which one has a greater demand in the market?\n ​\n 2) Is it necessary for newcomers to have knowledge of Akka?\n ​\n I have some experience with GraphQL and have been exposed to RPC-like concepts and classic MVC patterns. However, I feel hesitant about diving into actors, as they remind me of the unnecessary complexity I encountered with redux-saga. Would it be mandatory for me to learn Akka for my first few projects, or can I initially focus on other aspects?\n ​\n Thank you in advance for your assistance!\n ​\n P.S. #1 I would greatly appreciate it if you could also recommend any helpful materials such as books or project ideas to aid me on this journey.\n ​\n P.S. #2 As a more serious and long-term project idea, I am considering developing a \"Job Aggregator (Scraper)\" or a \"Job Board.\" Personally, I lean towards the first variant as it aligns more with data processing, and I am eager to spend time designing a system that can scrape data in real-time and notify subscribers. \n P.S. #3 I would like to extend my appreciation to ChatGPT for its assistance in crafting this beautifully written post in English.\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/PilipchukBogdan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Fellow Scala Enthusiasts!\n I'm pleased to announce that Tyrian 0.7.0 has just been released. 🚀\n Tyrian is a Scala 3, Elm-like frontend web framework for Scala.js, and I'm particularly excited about this release. There's only a few real changes in it, but they're good ones! ...some of them are also quite fundamental to how Tyrian works, so please report any problems or come and say hello on our Discord server if anything looks odd: https://discord.gg/b5CD47g 😅\n First, one of the most requested features has finally been implemented: Tyrian now has frontend routing as standard. You can now make multi-page SPA's with minimal fuss.\n Second, Tyrian's tiny runtime has been completely rewritten, resulting in super snappy start up times, and better performance than ever thanks to the wizards behind Cats Effect 3.5. (Please don't forget that Tyrian works equally well with both CE and ZIO.)\n Third, another oft requested feature: You can now start Tyrian apps just by embedding the script in a page. No more launching via JavaScript if you don't want to!\n Finally, a small but welcome usability improvement around our CSS property naming. Properties are now available in `camelCase` as well as their original `kebab-case`.\n Full details are in the release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.7.0\n All examples and Tyrian's g8 template have been brought up to date, the docs site will probably lag behind a bit as usual. 😬\n I hope you give it a go, and don't be shy about hoping onto our Discord server if you need any help ...or even if you just fancy chatting about frontend dev, game dev, or to generally heap praise on Scala.js.\n Happy routing!\n    submitted by    /u/davesmith00000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everybody,\n The Scala tooling is a common complain within the community, lately, we have been lucky to get more and better tools, like scala-cli, metals, etc.\n Time ago, I had to do some work with js where I was able to try Vercel/Netlify, those tools are super handy, for example, Vercel allows to deploy js projects that use next.js with minimal effort, also, it provides Preview Environments to each Pull Request, this is something that I really wanted to get in Scala.\n Last year I started building a similar tool (https://codepreview.io), as of now, it only supports Preview Environments, still, different to Vercel, codepreview actually let's you try the whole application, imagine a scala backend, scala.js frontend, postgres database, all of them packaged as a temporal app on every Pull Request (with it's unique domain).\n It's been a few months since we have been using codepreview on internal projects + a few customer projects, so far, the feedback has been good.\n Unfortunately, the project isn't as nice as Vercel, it would be lovely to get this installed with a few clicks like Vercel does, instead, I need to do a few manual steps for every project. Besides this, there are also some other improvements to make but I'm not fully confident on what to prioritize. Which is why I'm coming here to ask for help.\n My offering is, I'll grant a trial/free license to whoever is willing to give codepreview a try, I'd only ask for feedback, which should help me to prioritize the future work.\n So far, we have been working mainly with projects that use https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager, still, projects building fat jars should also work smoothly.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/AlexITC  \n [link]   [comments]",

We moved from IntelliJ to VSCode + Metals a while back because of the lack of Scala 3 support in IntelliJ. But I'm having serious problems with the debugger, to me it's nearly worthless. It can't do the simplest things, like just step over code, it jumps to what feel like totally random places deep in the ZIO codebase. The only way I can get it to sometimes work is by using {} brackets so that I can put pure Scala code, no ZIO's, on their own lines, and only break there. Then run from break point to break point, stepping is essentially useless.\n Is it just me, or are others having the same experience? Any good tips, or workarounds? Has IntelliJ started to catch up with Scala 3 support?

          "description": "Recently I have been looking at alternatives to Unity3d for gamedev. As part of this I created a very simple hex-based tic-tac-toe game using Scala.js and the 3d library Babylon.js. It also uses Vite.js for quick dev turnaround, Electron.js for native packaging, and ScalablyTyped to create a Babylon.js facade.\n I was quite happy with the result. It was especially nice to program in Scala again (after a long break) and be able to imagine using it for both client and server code. Now I need to consider whether it is right for me, as there are a number of business issues around using Javascript, but at least the technical side seems possible.\n Since there were a few pains getting all the different libraries to play nicely together, I thought the result may be useful to other people. No tutorial, but my notes are in the README and the code is all available on Github. Be aware I am not a Scala expert, but the code works as far as I have tested it.\n I broke the code into a few pieces for libs for possible reuse, or other people to look to for ideas\n  \nHexTacToe https://github.com/jarrahtech/HexTacToe - the game itself\n kassite https://github.com/jarrahtech/kassite - Scala.js for (hopefully) functionality common to multiple Scala.js/Babylon.js games - currently has tweening and some shader material stuff. No tests yet - need to work on that\n babylonjsfacade https://github.com/jarrahtech/babylonjsfacade - Scala.js facade of Babylon.js 6.2 (generated within the Github project by ScalablyTyped). I made this a separate project so that the others didn't need to import and build it (as it is quite large)\n  \nalso a couple of other libs which are less important for demonstrating the technologies:\n  \nhex https://github.com/jarrahtech/hex - Scala/Scala.js cross-building hex grid library\n jarrah-util https://github.com/jarrahtech/jarrah-util - Scala/Scala.js cross-building common game code/maths lib\n  \nHope its helpful for someone else,\n Charles.\n    submitted by    /u/cordinc  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Having only just found out about Scala recently, one of the things I seem to read everywhere is that Scala's popularity is not growing. In fact, some seem to say it is declining, and the numbers might bear that theory out somewhat.\n But most things I've read about the language are absolutely awesome!\n Two of the main problems I have heard are:\n  \nToo much change. Apparently the leap to Scala 3 was a little rushed and tooling is still catching up. This has left companies with a choice of either using legacy or investing in something that keeps changing.\n Too much power. It almost seems as though the power of Scala is limitless. Most articles I've read list a huge reel of concepts. Some of the ones that I can recognise seem powerful to the point of abusability, like metaprogramming. This also makes the language harder to learn.\n  \nPotential intervention to address criticisms:\n  \nA promise to freeze changes to the language and other core parts for a period of, say, three years (exempting bug fixes).\n  \nWhat do you think?

What I understand is the developer should own his own company so that the contracts is between the two businesses ie the client and the developer. And in some cases there's a talent recruitment firm in the middle. \n My question is does the job application process differ from normal employment job offers. \n Does the job application require you to apply as a business or individual say my company is scalaconsults. \n What if you are a 3 man outfit. All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.\n Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I've done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.\n Once your employed can you subcontract the work.\n Sorry for the many questions.

Accordingly, PureScript Domains is now PureScript Domain (although previously-registered subdomains remain active).\n Second, a purescri.pt URL will automatically be activated for any package added to purescri.pt/registry. By default, it will redirect to the corresponding GitHub repository, but you can change this behavior or opt out through a simple pull request.\n If you would like to participate, please visit purescri.pt for details.\n Thanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/nsaunders1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Adding a letter or taking one away fixes it. Not capitalizing it fixes it. Writing \"Conclusion and Discussion\" fixes it but \"Discussion and Conclusions\" does not. Only the word Discussion turns red and changes fonts. I have no idea where to begin troubleshooting this :) Anyone have any ideas?\n EDIT: the tex export shows the line \\section{{\\bfseries\\sffamily Discussion} and Conclusions} where the section header is.

I traced the code to the best of my abilities and I see that org-link-open is being executed.\n Does anybody know how to inhibit the \"visit tags table\" behaviour?\n  \nI do have many packages installed (emacs-prelude) so it might be something else.

Exiting and restarting Emacs fixes the problem.\n  org-capture randomly hangs, specifically when using C-c C-q (org-set-tags-command) in the capture window. Killing emacs works and recover-this-file recovers correctly though.\n  \nI understand that this may be a very specific issue with my configuration, so this is not a rant about org-mode, rather a request for any pointers where or what I should look at.\n Regards, -bd\n    submitted by    /u/BornDeranged  \n [link]   [comments]",

However it doesn’t offer an exhaustive list of all build-in properties, nor detail if and in what form they can be overwritten by user, and what happens if user so does anyway.\n This kind of list is the exact thing I am trying to parse together for myself. My current strategy is using the add propety function which lists all available properties, the Reserved Properties -listing under Properties section, which offers a glossary explanation of individual properties, and searching the Index for word ‘Property’, and once I find a new link, I visit it and hopefully find other properties near it.\n However, this is pretty slow way to gather the list, and it doesn’t really distinguish between useful properties, properties user can use if they want, and system-breaking properties.\n Usually better documentation is written in the relevant chapter of the manual, if the property is intended to be used.\n Has anyone written about this online? I found some youtube videos discussing some of the properties related to clocking, but generally it seems this information is written from the opposite direction from my approach: from usecase to property, not from property to usecase.\n I don’t have any good reasoning behind wanting this information. I just want to write it down in my notes, and while doing it gain some insight into org-mode as a system.\n What I mean by system breaking is something like CLOCKSUM_T. I haven’t yet tested the behaviour, but as this is used to calculate todays clocked time for a heading and it’s children, it is very clear that either the users input is overwritten, or the clocksum is inaccurate. This might not be strictly system-breaking, but neither does it make sense inside the system.\n    submitted by    /u/stepbroImstuck_in_SU  \n [link]   [comments]",

For projects.org (with maxlevel 2) I want to see the top-level headlines, and nothing lower. Is this possible? Is helm messing this up?\n    submitted by    /u/fosswugs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have all my config in a single giant org mode file. This file produces three others when tangled, init.el, early-init.el and a custom theme for my colorscheme. Problem is, whenever I make a change in the org file, and tangle the changes, the git repo for my dotfiles now sees two different files being modified (obviously) with the same changes. It makes it really cumbersome to do proper commits, since if I did many changes and I'd like to do various commits for each of them, I have to add not only the changes in the org file, but also hunt down the same modifications in the init and early-init files (mostly init tho).\n I recently tried to fix this by dropping all of the init.el contents into some other file, call it \"real-init.el\". Then, I would have a very minimal init.el that would check if init and early-init exist, and if they don't, it would tangle the org file and restart emacs. I would just keep track of the org file and the minimal init file in the git repo, and since the init file is very minimal and wouldn't change very often, it would be a fine compromise.\n For some odd reason, while the files did get tangled, emacs would just restart indefinitely. It opened, then closed, then opened, then closed. I had to force kill it.\n Has anyone else faced this problem? How did you solve it?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've spent quite a lot of time in LISP-land over the last few years and have internalized and begun to rely on a lot of nifty paredit features, for example slurping and barfing.\n When writing and editing, for example, JavaScript or C++ code I end up situations where I instinctively try to slurp identifiers with, obviously, no success.\n Even though there are relatively few cases where this would make sense in non-sexp code, there are the cases of the misplaced parens, for example.. given the code:\n some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); \n If I decide that I want to wrap one of these arguments in a function, I'd place the cursor before the argument and enter the function name followed by a left-paren, the mode will be kind and automatically insert a closing paren and I end up with the following, with the cursor inside the parens of `awesomify`\n some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, awesomify()another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); \n This is where I'd like to do the equivalent of a slurp, effectively moving that closing paren to the end of the next expression - after ànother_splendid_variable`, but before the comma.\n ​\n I figure I can't be the first one to experience the want for something like this. Does it exist? If not, does anyone have a good idea how to implement a minor mode for this?\n It doesn't have to be 100% fool-proof for my needs, and I figure it wouldn't be too hard to just make a dumb language-agnostic implementation for the exact example above. But I'd also like it to be DWIM:y enough and handle more complex expressions, in which case the mode would somehow need to hook into the syntax model of the language.\n Discuss! Or.. fight! Or insult me. I'm thankful for basically any thoughts on the matter that could move me in the right direction.\n    submitted by    /u/tinkerorb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have added it to path but when I start emacs, there is no change to it at all. I am guessing emacs is not picking up the correct init file but I am not sure why.\n Info about my system: Running Arch, I have XDG_CONFIG_DIR set so instead of doom install installing it to the normal ~/.emacs.d/ and ~/.doom.d directories, the things are installed under .config/emacs and .config/doom directories. Reading up the doc it says emacs respects the XDG spec.\n I tried loading the init file under ~/.config/doom/ manually by using emacs -q --load but no change there as well.\n Any help would be great\n    submitted by    /u/protienbudspromax  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a long time, I didn't annotate my reading materials because I preferred reading on my tablet instead of my computer. And I never found a good app to use on my Android tablet either. And of course, without proper conversion to org-mode, all of those notes seemed useless.\n Then I discovered org-noter. I was excited but couldn't use it. The automatic window handling was frustrating, and I couldn't invest the time to fix it. Recently, I needed to take notes from multiple books, so I tried org-noter again, but I still can't find the best workflow.\n My initial issue was with the way how org-noter creates a \"special\" layout with a dedicated window. It sometimes even creates another frame - which I especially hate, even setting org-noter-always-create-frame to nil still occasionally creates a frame. I guess not a huge deal, I can live with that.\n After taking some notes, I noticed they were out of sync the next day. I tried to fix each note's page number manually - :NOTER_PAGE: prop, but it would randomly change the page numbers in other notes. Yes, I would open a page in pdf-tools, then I call org-noter-sync-current-page-or-chapter to check if the note and the page numbers match and fix them (when needed). But it also would change page numbers in some other notes. I can't figure out why. Clearly, either I'm doing something wrong, or I need to set some vars or it's just a bad combination of things, versions of pdf-tools, poppler, Emacs, etc. on my machine causing these issues. Maybe (like so many things) it just never properly worked on Mac?\n I want this tool to work, but I am struggling to find a workflow that fits. If my notes are consistently out of sync, I can't see the point of using org-noter. Can someone please advise me on their workflow, tips, and configuration?\n    submitted by    /u/ilemming  \n [link]   [comments]",

To help me with that, I have made a little function that shows me the current progress I have made today when I press s-#.\n It even has a \"graphical\" aspect to it, the color changes bit by bit from gray to green, and it simulates a \"bar\" that fills up. The number of characters/pages needed for my daily goal to be done is in a variable I have in my init file.\n I am sorry I opened a new thread, I wanted to post this in the thread \"Emacs for literature\", but I don't know how to post a picture in an answer to thread. So here is the Minibuffer a few times during the day, to give you some idea of what I mean.\n It is in German, the translation would be: 92.791 characters, 30 pages, equals 56 percent [today new: 0/2] Current page 93 percent, scene 1 page, chapter 1 page.\n In the modeline, I also show what \"page\" I am on. It just divides the length of the Buffer through the average number of characters on a standard page (3000 characters). Must seem like a very un-Emacsy way of doing things to you, but it helps me to get a feeling of getting things done somehow. :) \n https://preview.redd.it/unxa09de2l1b1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c7e520182c65caa1f4513aa336507c96b71fdc\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

It get stuck and can't move to the next option. I have searched if someone had the similar bug in github for vertico and corfu but looks like no one is mentioning about.

Also I'm sharing my configuration and the error message I'm getting from corfu.

I've ordered the book purely to appreciate the insights in this article. I'm of course convinced I will find a lot of good stuff in it, but I haven't even began digging into it. But I did create the following little snippet that has in the last 24h already improved my quality of life significantly:\n ``` (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t) ;; Introduce a bottom side window that catches ;; compilations, deadgreps etc. (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist '(\"\\deadgrep.\\|\\Compilation\\\" (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . 0) (window-parameters (no-delete-other-windows . t))))\n (defun deets/side-window-resize (enlarge) (let ((bottom-windows (window-at-side-list (window-normalize-frame nil) 'bottom))) (dolist (window bottom-windows) (when (symbolp (window-parameter window 'window-side)) (if enlarge (window-resize window (window-height window)) (window-resize window (- (/ (window-height window) 2))))))))\n (defun deets/side-window-toggle (arg) (interactive \"P\") (cond ((null arg) (window-toggle-side-windows)) ((listp arg) (deets/side-window-resize t)) ((symbolp arg) (deets/side-window-resize nil))))\n ;; Remove our side-windows (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro \"C-x w\") 'deets/side-window-toggle) ```\n When compiling or grepping, the window is placed a the bottom. I can quickly enlarge/shrink the window, and toggle it. Very happy with this, and I'm already thinking about further improvements.\n    submitted by    /u/__deeetz__  \n [link]   [comments]",

Orgzly has a strange concept which is NoteBook. Thats not the issue, the real issue is it cant recursively download .org files properly. I use org mode mainly on laptop, so I just cloned my org notes to a new local place, rearrange in a single level folder, and plan to sync it from there. Do you have any better ideas? Or better apps? Any tips like renaming files is also welcome (but prefer not to).\n ​\n picture is output from Linux tree command of my original org notes.

So do these two keybindings have different functionality in different contexts, or are they always the same? Because why have two enabled by default? (Maybe for user convenience of different keyboard layouts, but this is a bit too confusing more than necessary, maybe the devs meant to implement keyboard layout detection but failed..?).\n This All may seem dumb to be asking, (like why not just rebind C-- to zoom out and get over with it) but I'm confused thinking that there probably should be a good reason this is not by default in Emacs yet.\n Maybe I'm just thinking too highly of the \"intelligent design behind Emacs\"?

However when I run a large amount of R code using polymode-eval-buffer or similar, the code will run, however I will be unable to interact with Emacs the whole time, mousing over Emacs shows the windows loading symbol as my cursor, but doesn't say \"not responding\". The file isn't particularly long, ~800 lines, and if I run it in two halves using polymode-eval-buffer-from-point-to-end or polymode-eval-buffer-from-beg-to-point it works as expected.\n The code takes a long time to run, loading in a couple million spatial points and doing stuff with them, which I'm sure is the main reason it happens, but running this code in Rstudio doesn't freeze it!\n I've read online in various places that setting ess-eval-visibly to nil or nowait solves some peoples issues, but doesn't change anything for me...\n Thanks for any help you guys can give!\n    submitted by    /u/bepppi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Microsoft Access has a few virtues, like being a desktop app and rather robust in its ability to customize (by Microsoft standards). At its most basic, it will read from and write to a database, usually through Forms that have been customized to display certain information from a database in a certain layout. And because it works with one source of truth (e.g., it can connect to SQL and PostgreSQL databases), multiplayer data entry and collaboration is more feasible than in a purely plain text method being shared by a syncing service.\n The problem is, Microsoft Access is one sin shy of being the devil. It’s proprietary and buggy, and coding in VBA is a nightmare compared to most languages, especially our beloved elisp. Someone said MS Access is the best worst way to make a database program, and I think that sums it up well.\n I know emacs can interface with SQL databases, but are there any packages that try to accomplish something like Microsoft Access, i.e., rapid application development via forms that display and allow editing certain fields from a database? If not, what would be the best practices in building this functionality?\n    submitted by    /u/jMilton13  \n [link]   [comments]",

(my-org-mode mode with a keymap containing \"C-c a\"). I can add a hook for org-mode to also enable my-org-mode, and on change-major-mode hook to disable my-org-mode.\n Then I could make this mode have higher precedence than org-mode using 'emulation-mode-map-alists. (Basically what this is saying but for every mode I define bindings for)\n Could do the same for a \"global map\" that will have lower precedence than the mode-specific ones.\n Then for the bindings I don't define it should \"just work\".\n Is this a decent idea for trying to achieve what I want or am I way overcomplicating this?\n Also are there any packages that could help me do this or do I have to code it up myself.

Switching between 2 or 3 or more layouts would be awesome.\n No need to save them between emacs sessions, but that could be interesting as well.\n Ideally such concepts as..\n - layout list\n - layout create\n - layout switch\n - layout kill\n I've been fiddling with 0blayout package, which covers most of it. No layout list, but layout-switch with vertico more or less covers it.\n The problem with that one is it doesn't seem to save/restore the location for each window..\n ex: If I make a layout which is split into a top and bottom window A and B, with code on top and an org file on bottom, and then switch to some other layout.. and then back, it'll prooperly restore the window layout for A and B and bcak to those files... great! HOWEVER, if A and B are the same file, but different locations within it, that doesn't work.. both windows A and B will switch to the same file, the same position within it. \n I guess I could look into saving window layouts to registers and popping around that way, but I was sure there was a more sophisticated way of doing it.\n (I forget if Bufler does this .. I use filetree as my buffer-list replacement, and bufler doesn't work well when Tramp with remote sessions are alive.. so I've generally ignored Bufler the last year or two.)\n Thanks for reading :)\n    submitted by    /u/FrozenOnPluto  \n [link]   [comments]",

Installing a language server in each venv seems a bit of overkill, especially since I am always going to use the same language server and the people I work with on Python projects don't need the (same) language server (as they use something like VSCode with Pylance). \n On the other hand, installing the language server in the venv saves me a bit of work creating the relevant config files to ensure they run the commands with the right binary (e.g. I don't need to create a mypy.ini files to ensure mypy runs from the venv, nor do I need a pyrightconfig.json to point the server to the venv).\n I found a way to get both pyright and pylsp working on Emacs, whether they are globally installed or installed in the venv.

Let me explain.\n If I have a dir structure like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── proyecto-tres \n And the current buffer is readme.org, getting the project name - 'proyecto-uno' is fairly easy, if you're using projectile, you can do (projectile-project-name), right? Alternatively, you can use: (magit-toplevel), which returns full path, i.e., ~/projects/proyecto-uno/ and then you can just grab the last segment.\n Now, it gets tricky when you're using git-worktrees and the structure of the project is like this:\n . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── .bare ├── master ├── development ├── .git ├── readme2.org ├── proyecto-tres \n The current buffer is readme2.org. How do you get the project name? (projectile-project-name) returns development (and I want 'proyecto-dos'). (magit-toplevel) returns full path to \"development\" dir not to 'proyecto-dos'. \n So then you may suggest, why don't you check, if the buffer is inside a worktree? And that I don't know how to.

Attaching complex values to your user input command sentences and quickly modifying any part of these sentences allows you to express a lot of rich commands in a short time. That is the secret to the efficiency of magit, and magit doesn't even use very complex flow control. Infix overriding allows your interface to reflect and follow the state of the application.\n I'm not terribly incentivized to go beyond the showcase, which at worst contains working examples for just about every behavior.

I have just noticed that github has added an outline option (the right-most icon at the top of the file info), which might allow you to skip quickly through the increasingly large \"upgrading\" section.\n Do note this assumes some amount of knowledge about Getting Things Done, so that might turn out to be a blocker anyway :) \n The info file is here : https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/org-gtd.info And obviously you might want to download it and load it inside emacs with C-u h i. For the info file, in addition to questions about things that make sense and don't, I have questions about how things get displayed through the interface, what links make sense or are surprising, what is helpful, etc.\n If you choose to help, I'll be extremely grateful!

          "description": "When dealing with log files, I find the Auto-revert-mode is useful to monitor the changes. However, it can also consume more system resources, particularly on large files which updates frequently over tramp. I want a simple solution where a single key-press can update the log file on demand. Moreover, I don't want to accidentally edit it so I want the read-only mode with single key-press update feature. I have the following pipeline:\n  \nOpen the log file and convert to read-only-mode (C-x C-q key-press).\n When read-only-mode is activated then we remap the 'g' key to the revert-buffer. One possible solution is to use `current-local-map` function but the downside is that remapping will be activated in all the files opened with that major-mode.

          "description": "Hi all,\n pretty much the title question. I asked the same on r/lisp but I realize it's better suited here. I like Edebug because it allows to follow the computation even in a single form, from the inside out. Like, given something like\n (+ 3 (/ 4 n))\n I can see exactly not only what n is, but also what are the intermediate results. The closest thing I found for now is Sly's stickers, but I wondered if there was an actual equivalent. Otherwise, I find CL's debugger a bit difficult to use in step-mode, but that could easily being me not having read the manual thoroughly. So, does a CL-Edebug exist, much like CIDER's for Clojure? And if not, can I use SLIME/Sly to step between forms (from inside out)?\n P.S., IIUC Sly is the improved (better?) version of SLIME. Is it right?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/a-searcher  \n [link]   [comments]",

We recently created a questionnaire that takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete and are looking for participants (we tried to shorten it as much as we could). We unfortunately cannot offer compensation for that, but are hoping data from volunteers will help us design more customizable systems on the long term. Any help would be deeply appreciated.\n Questionnaire : https://expe.lille.inria.fr/limesurvey/index.php/526753?lang=en&community=emacs\n If this research is of any interest to you, we are also looking for participants to interview about their specific solutions to automate frequent actions. Please contact use if you are willing to share your experience, our emails are available in the first page of the questionnaire or you can simply DM me.\n Note: be aware our questionnaire relies on LimeSurvey which uses non-libre JS libraries.\n    submitted by    /u/b_fruchard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recognize that asking such a question might seem peculiar; however, please allow me to elaborate. My journey with Linux has led me to an insatiable desire for optimization, beginning with vim/neovim and permeating nearly every aspect of my digital life. I have hand-crafted scripts for everything. The only thing left is to unify my coding and writing experience in one place.\n I use vim for coding, and I'm very happy with it. However, when it comes to writing, the visual representation of equations and figures help me concentrate on content. While vimtex (a vim plugin) offers a solution for creating LaTeX-based PDFs, the fusion of code and text hinders my thought process. For me, writing on a computer has to be similar to putting pen on a paper, where the focus is on content, not on the representation. For this reason, I sought an alternative solution and my search led me to TeXmacs. Here's how my notes look. No ugly LaTex -- equations/figures look nice, etc.\n TeXmacs is nice and all, except that it's not vim. I can't use all of my fancy plugins (jump between files, write custom snippets, define custom actions, etc). It seems that emacs can be made just as powerful as vim, while also having the ability to display inline equations and images. This seems like the answer to all my questions, except that I only looking at the positives. I hesitate to succumb to the illusion of greener pastures, as vim has served me impeccably, save for the aforementioned limitations. Thus, I must ask: is Emacs the solution I seek?\n    submitted by    /u/medwatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please see the example below with checkboxes.\n * Question - [X] Box 1 Some notes on Box 1 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. - [X] Another Box: box 2 Some notes on box 2 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. \n When I check the boxes next to Box 1 and \"Another Box: box 2\" the lines \"Box 1\" and \"Another Box: box 2\" are grayed out (originally they are white when the boxes are not checked). This is great and I like that. However, the \"Some notes...when it is done\" are not grayed out even after the boxes are checked. They stay white.

The problem is, org's Tag Hierarchy seems to work in the opposite way that I want; when I create a hierarchy like this:\n (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) (\"@anywhere\") (:grouptags) (:startgrouptag) (\"@computer\") (:grouptags) (\"@work\") (\"@home\") (:endgrouptag) (:endgrouptag)) \n Then filter by e.g. @work, I only get @work-tagged entries. On the other hand, when I reverse the hierarchy like this:\n (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgrouptag) (\"@work\") (:grouptags) (\"@anywhere\") (\"@computer\") (:endgrouptag) (:startgrouptag) (\"@home\") (:grouptags) (\"@anywhere\") (\"@computer\") (:endgrouptag)) \n I can filter by @work or @home and get the results I want, however I can't filter by @computer and see all @work/@home/@computer/@anywhere-tagged entries. And, unfortunately, if I add a grouptag section for @computer, it includes children of that group in @work and @home now, corrupting those groups.\n So my question is: is there a better way to filter to include a child in a hierarchy OR its parents? FWIW I've also tried using the | operator in my filter query (e.g. @work|@anywhere) but org doesn't seem to parse it, and it does no filtering (it gives me a message like @work|@anywhere filter ignored because tag/category is not represented).\n ​\n (btw, I'm using doom emacs, in case that happens to be relevant here)\n    submitted by    /u/C-x_M-c_M-butterfly  \n [link]   [comments]",

The proposed solution in the manual is to have an elist file that locally modifies the org-roam-directory and org-roam-db-location variables. I didn't really like this approach, so I made something better, a very simple function that between a given list of Zettlekasten:\n (setq zettlekasten-paths-alist '((\"Main\" . \"~/Some/Path/\") (\"Zettlekasten2\" . \"~/Other/Path/\"))) (defun switch-zettlekasten () (interactive) (let* ((keys (mapcar #'car zettlekasten-paths-alist)) (prompt (format \"Select Zettlekasten:\")) (key (completing-read prompt keys)) (chosen-zettlekasten-path (cdr (assoc key zettlekasten-paths-alist)))) (setq org-roam-directory chosen-zettlekasten-path) (setq org-roam-db-location (concat chosen-zettlekasten-path \"org-roam.db\")) (org-roam-db-sync))) \n I have personally bound this to C-c n s since C-c n is the prefix for org-roam related commands. The s stands for switch. You may use anything else of course. Hope you find it useful.\n EDIT: Oops, I made a mistake when first posting this.

          "description": "I am wholly unsurprised that Harold Innis (1894-1952) maintained a card index (zettelkasten) through his research life, but I am pleased to have found that his literary estate has done some work on it and published it as The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis (University of Toronto Press, 1980). The introduction seems to have some fascinating material on the form and structure as well as decisions on how they decided to present and publish it.\nFor those unaware of his work, primarily as a political economist, he wrote extensively on media and communication theory including the influential works Empire and Communications (1950) and The Bias of Communication (1951). \nWhile I appreciate the published book nature of the work, it would be quite something to have it excerpted back down to index card form as a piece of material culture to purchase and play around with. Perhaps something in honor of the coming 75th anniversary of his passing?\n(Originally published with aggregated replies at https://boffosocko.com/2023/05/25/harold-innis-the-idea-file/)",

Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.\nI'll start.\nI'm reading some lightweight new books:\nJalāl al-Dīn Rūmī and Gafori, Haleh Liza. Gold, Simon and Schuster. 2022.\nFaulkner, Grant. The art of brevity: crafting the very short story, Prometheus Books. 2023.\nI've released the pressure cooker steam that I put myself in by taking a graduate-level writing seminar on food. since the class ended, the floodgates burst, doubling the time spent in the garden of my ZK. Some of my structure and sub-hub notes have gotten large, and I find I'm looking at refactoring them. Thinking about structure note size, I'm not sure smaller is better in the age of fast search. I have a bunch of search tools/extensions that help focus link creation and finding stuff for the output side of zettelkasting. A technique I'm stealing from someone on the forums is when placing a note on a structure note to look closer at links already on the structure note for link candidates. The fact that they are placed in a particular section of a structure note means the note is surrounded by ideas that relate. Or maybe I can figure out a way to link to a section of structure notes. (I already have a method of linking to a specific place in a note but don't use it in this workflow.)\nPython programming continues to be exciting, and having a large collection of notes as a playground has been fruitful. I've expanded \"Idea Explorer\" to provide more information about a note thread. It now has tabs for the \"Tag Map\" and a tab with all the one-sentence summaries of the notes listed together.  I continue to work with trending for my ZK dashboard. Part of which is behind \"My Ten-day Zettel Production.\"\nOnce again, writing precedes my thinking.\n\nMy ten-day zettel production.",

[Academics don't want you to know this secret trick: this free software setup is workable for writers of all kinds.] Professor Chappell's guide walks you through the software installation, which includes git for version control, Pandoc for document processing, and the VSCode editor with plugins for Pandoc citations and document export. After the one-time software installation, the writer begins each document with a Markdown template. The Markdown template includes some LaTeX macros for page formatting--Prof Chappell recommends installing the MikTeX LaTeX distribution. Modifying the Pandoc LaTeX template is unnecessary (though I have done this to avoid repetition): add LaTeX packages and macros to the Markdown document template as needed.\nThe setup is interesting and will get you part of the way to a Zettelkasten with VSCode. The installed software and workflow are compatible with Zettlr and Obsidian, though this requires additional configuration.",

This contains each of the individual pieces of the system (atomic ideas).  But then my enthusiasm dies down as I realize this image is essentially MULTIPLE ideas in one graphic, triggering analysis paralysis as I consider how to capture this within my Obsidian-based Zettelkasten.\nMY QUESTION FOR YOU\nBefore you read on, pretend you ran into this information.  Your goal is to use your Zettelkasten to help you write strategy documents for your company AND to write articles for product managers in startups to help them launch better products.\nHow would YOU capture the gold within this infographic within your Zettelkasten?\nOPTIONS I'M CONSIDERING\nNow that you've considered your own solutions, here's a few I thought of.\nCreate one Obsidian Canvas, capturing the entire infographic (a Card for each part of the flowchart and each checklist).  Then begin creating Zettels or linking existing Zettels for each individual component, replacing each Card with a Note instead as I go.\n\n\nTechnically, this option violates the \"Atomic Notes\" rule since my first Zettel would be this full infographic - I'd be essentially capturing a contextualized idea, then breaking it down, which may not yield surprise insights as going bottom-up should.\n\nCreate an Overview Zettel (simple text file) with each item written out, then use this Overview Zettel to create individual Zettels from there.\n\n\nSame concept as #1, but in a text file rather than a Canvas.\n\nKeep this infographic in my Lit Note (aka Reference) and create individual zettels as I go.\nDoes one of these align with what you would do?  If so, which one and why?  If not, how would your approach differ from any of mine?\nThanks in advance!",

Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.\nI'll start.\nI finally released my project that extends The Archive, showing an \"Idea Explorer\" on demand for every note. This can be thought of as a way to look at \"note sequences.\" Sequences that develop an idea. I'm looking for collaborators to develop this idea further. Idea Explorer - an extension exclusively for The Archive.\nThis past week I've had the opportunity to practice and work on my technique for onboarding videos into my ZK. Speed and timing are critical—speed in taking notes and timing in reviewing the event. I feel I've gained a little success making a rough, rough draft during the presentation, then immediately after, as part of the process of watching a video, I expand my notes as I would if they were highlights from an article. Having a few minutes of uninterrupted time immediately after the video presentation to fill in my thoughts on my note is critical.\nI'm looking to do more of this. I get excited when I onboard live streams or Zoom events more than videos where I can start, stop, and replay the action. They feel more dynamic, and they spark my juices.\nMaybe I should try sketch-noting. It just feels like my skills at sketching are so poor that I'd miss stuff with the fast pace of a live presentation. Maybe this would be best reserved for youtube videos.\n\nMy ten day zettel production",
