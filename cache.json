So I deleted .stack-work and the stack.yaml stuff. Still not working.\n Like, come on. Haskell has a steep learning curve as is. It's hard for people to get started.

          "description": "I spent some time this weekend writing up an alpha version of some ideas I had about command line option parsing as a haskell package: cyclops.\n To start, if you're looking for a robust and full-featured option parser, cyclops isn't that yet. Let me recommend optparse-applicative and optparse-generic, which are both great.\n The Big Idea of cyclops is to support a declarative option-parsing style (just say what arguments you expect, rather than how to parse it) while keeping the option description as close as possible to the variable bind location.\n To that end, it uses ViewPatterns and TypeApplications with DataKinds to pass option specifications backwards from the bind location using type inference.\n main = do ( switch @'[\"d\", \"debug\"] @\"Show debugging statements\" -> debug ,flagged @'[\"dictionary\"] @\"PATH\" @\"File to draw words from\" .defaultTo @\"--dictionary /usr/share/dict/words\" -> dictionaryPath ,option @'[\"s\", \"seed\"] @\"NUM\" @\"Seed value for PRNG\" .readable -> seed ,arg @\"count\" @\"Number of passwords to generate\" .readable -> count ,arg @\"template\" @\"Template for generated passwords\" .oneOrMore .defaultTo @\"w w w w\" -> template ) <- getOps Conf { description = \"Generate pseudorandom passwords using a template.\" , version = \"1.0.0.20220702\" } \n Type inference places some constraints not visible in the above example code - if seed is inferred to be an Int by how it's used in the rest of the code, then that's how it getOps will attempt to parse --option 123.\n This release isn't really ready for primetime yet, but if you like the basic concept, let me know, and I'll keep working it.\n    submitted by    /u/rampion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, after intensive testing i just released my first library on hackage!\n Interval Tree Clocks - They serve as an alternative to vector clocks, which are a concept to track logical time. In distributed contexts, comparison by timestamps might be skewed. \n Vector clocks and version vectors however have the weakness of \"actor explosion\" because you cannot remove traces of an actor that might be long gone. They only allow you to increment the version vector in length.\n Interval tree clocks solve this by managing a tree-representation of said vector clock. With interval tree clocks you can dynamically add (fork) or remove (join) actors / replicas from your system and have your versions grow and shrink accordingly, while still holding the monotonically increasing semantics.\n They can similarly be used as either version vectors or vector clocks.\n I have thoroughly tested the code. Nonetheless if you are an expert on the topic, I'd love to get your criticism. Nevertheless, because it's my first library, I appreciate all and any feedback I can get.\n Hope this helps you build distributed systems some day!\n ​\n Hackage link: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interval-tree-clock-0.1.0.0\n ​\n This library provides the bare operations as described in the original paper: Almeida, Paulo & Baquero, Carlos & Fonte, Victor.

A simplified example:\n data Normalized data Denormalized class Normalize x where type Normalization x normalize :: x -> Normalization x -- 'Foo' uses phantom type n to track whether normalization has been applied. data Foo n = Foo String -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has already been 'Normalized' is a no-op. instance Normalize (Foo Normalized) where type Normalization (Foo Normalized) = Foo Normalized normalize = id -- Normalizing a 'Foo' that has not already been normalized transforms the String. instance Normalize (Foo Denormalized) where type Normalization (Foo Denormalized) = Foo Normalized normalize (Foo s) = Foo (map toUpper s) -- A smart constructor produces a 'Foo' with no normalization applied mkFoo :: String -> Foo Denormalized mkFoo = Foo \n By exporting mkFoo but not the Foo data constructor, I can prevent users of this library from manually constructing a value of type Foo Normalized. Instead, they're forced to do something like:\n normalize (mkFoo \"x\") \n However, it seems they could still circumvent normalization via coerce:\n coerce (mkFoo \"x\") :: Foo Normalized \n The documentation for Coercible seems to suggest this should not be the case, given that the Foo data constructor is not in scope, but playing around with it in ghci I'm finding I can perform this undesirable coercion.\n For now, I've added a type role annotation to prevent such coercion,\n type role Foo nominal \n but I'm curious to know why coerce is working otherwise, despite the fact that the Foo data constructor is not in scope.

Also, you can do this in Sage: simplify(arccos(sin(pi/3))) and get back 1/6*pi Right. Just like sqrt(2) gives back sqrt(2) and if you want the actual number you have to tell it explicitly numerical_approx(sqrt(2), digits=60) All out of the box. What's Sage doing that Haskell isn't, and can Haskell do this? Python also have \"symbolic\" capabilities as well.

This gets worse when I have many such datatypes and many recursive functions. Apart from the first case arm, the function only cares whether a node is a terminal (and cannot be recursed into) or a non-terminal (an intermediate node with zero or more children).\n I feel like there must exist a generic solution for this, where I would define a way of retrieving children from a given node once, and the recursion and distribution over data constructors would happen automatically.

Each function returns a sequence of case classes representing the data source that has been fetched from the database. \n The “half baked idea” is: What if “whenever something interesting happens” I could deserialize this DataAccess class and replay the test data through the latest version of the app for debugging and testing purposes. \n Does anyone have any kind of experience with such a pattern? What tools did you consider to help with the “snapshotting” (serialization and deserialization)? Where did you persist your snapshots?\n Some considerations: 1. There are about a hundred different case classes available through various functions in the DataAccess class 2. The “amount” of data is large. So while I view storage cost as essentially free, serialization / deserialization performance (primarily deserialization) is a concern\n A few options I could think of are: 1. A database, either a “real database” or perhaps some kind of in-memory database 2. Serializing to disk storage on some server in ProtoBuf, Mempack, Csv, json etc. 3. ???\n    submitted by    /u/Employee-Weak  \n [link]   [comments]",

I copied it and ran but I remembered I use code runner, so I move to terminal to provide arguments. Now, I am in terminal, inside the correct dir, I do scalac main.scala and it generates 2 files we all know. Now, I do scala Hello 12 and it works just fine. Now, let's make a simplest scala hello world program and do scala main.scala; I usually name my object as Hello and file as main.scala; without doing scalac and it runs fine. What the heck? I know my knowledge is lacking somewhere. Please pardon me for my english or difficulty to explain my question and help me with this doubt in simple but complete sentences (no layers of abstraction LoL). Thank you so much.

          "description": "Hello there! \n I'm currently working with a scala codebase and it's very new for me as I only worked with NodeJs on a very sketchy codebase. I'm starting to question the \"good practices\" setup by the previous developers but I'm struggling to find good references as to what really are considered good practices in scala and what are definitely crucial errors often made by new developers learning the trade. I was wondering if you had any resources you find/found yourself returning to? \n FYI I am currently working on a REST API (which is not very RESTful in my opinion but that's another debate) with Scala 2 + Play + Slick (and some Akka actors for cron jobs but I don't really understand why). No documentation, no tests of any kind. I feel that files are all over the place (there is not a really defined logical architecture). Logs didn't even had a date & time before I added it to the logger (I had never even thought about not having date & time on logs before but I guess people can work without it). Sometimes controllers directly communicate with DAOs without services, and DAOs communicate between themselves, I thought it was frowned upon but I've been told otherwise by the previous devs... \n Anyway! \n TLDR : what's your go-to documentation?\n    submitted by    /u/DespicableHarpoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been working as a contractor for the last 2 years and worked with 3 different clients. One thing is common for all of them, and that is a very poor quality codebase, without any documentation, some tests, a fundamental misunderstanding of how libraries like ZIO or Cats-Effect should be used, a tendency to overcomplicate literally everything, using GraphQL without reasonable explanation, using Slick with Cats-Effect, instead of a doobie, etc.\n After some time, I realized that I am very frustrated with my career, even If Scala was everything I ever wanted to do, I've invested a lot of time and money to be in this position I am now. I have a very high daily rate, and in spite of that, I am very unhappy with all the Scala projects I was working on.\n I started to doubt myself lately, because, before this Scala contract role, I was very happy at my work, with smart colleagues open for discussion, a very simple and clean codebase, and no overengineering, but it was an outsourcing company and it was getting really hard to get raise. Now I literally earn 8-9 times more than just 2-3 years ago but have a feeling that I always find shitty company. Just wanted to mention that all companies are product based.\n I just wanted to check, what are your experiences with Scala-based companies?\n    submitted by    /u/pexan28206  \n [link]   [comments]",

Scalable and scaled across the platforms, use cases, domains and industries. Across the Universe.\n It has it all: great syntax, powerful features, sound type system, solid IDE support, tooling, libraries, great community.\n But it also must run on all the platforms: server, browser, and mobile. Both iOS and Android. \n JVM and Scala.js are awesome, thank you very much.\n We used to have some momentum on Android, but there's nothing left these days. We are non existent on iOS.\n Maybe I'm not aware of something, but it looks to me we are losing developers to Scala's pathetic parody, Kotlin.\n Which became an obvious choice for devs, being the de-facto default language for Android development, that also compiles to JS, and has interoperability with Swift/Objective-C. They can use it for everything indeed.\n I find this situation very sad, wrong, unfair, and alarming. My fear is that if nothing changes Scala will slowly but steadily lose its share and eventually vanish, remaining only in legacy codebases, and oldfags' memories as the G.O.A.T. that didn't make it.\n Scala must win, it's just better.\n I don't know how to help with this except by pointing out the obvious.\n I understand that working on implicit context functions, capabilities, effects and multi-stage programming is much more interesting. But.\n Please, please, please, break this cycle, rise above, focus on multi platform support!\n Collaborate with Google on Android, I'm sure they love Scala. Apple loves Scala, just take a swift look at Swift! Maybe they would help?\n Kotlin recently announced Alpha version of their multiplatform initiative.

          "description": "I've recently started developing a SPA with Scala.js. It's an amazing experience to have shared entities on client and server, but I'm still struggling to choose a frontend architecture (did a bit of Coffeescript and jQuery 8 years ago).\n I've started with scalajs-react. Overall the experience was good (perhaps the overloaded API is my biggest concern, but we can live with that). Then I stumbled upon a problem where I need to propagate a state change from two leaf components and found out I need something like this Redux thing. I trtied built-in StateSnapshot, but couldn't make it working. Then I googled for Scala-land alternatives and it seems like there are few semi-abandoned Redux facades and Diode. Diode looks like what I need, but:\n  \nNo Scala 3 support\n See side-note\n  \nSide-note: at some point I decided to give up on React and tried Tyrian (Elm architecture). The experience was a total blast. CE3-friendly, Dotty-first etc etc. And I would stay with it, but I realised that I desperately need React.js ecosystem. And Tyrian seems to be quite poor at interoperability. \n Anyways, I'm looking for something that can solve state propagation problem for scalajs-react, but with Scala 3 support.\n    submitted by    /u/MysteriousGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works very well.\n The only issue I have is that the agenda is rebuild after each (bulk) refile, which takes a while (10~15 seconds every time). It does take long but not forever, but it is already annoying although I am rather new to org and my files are not that large.\n Is there an option/command/prefix/hack I am missing that allows me to prevent the rebuild of the agenda every time?\n As plan B, is there another/better way to refile several entries at the same time that does not involve agendas?\n ---\n I noticed that the agenda is not re-build when I archive a heading (using a in the agenda view). I guess this is because the command predictably removes the heading from the agenda. Since my refiles are also doing that, this is in theory similar.\n ---\n I found this thread in which I learned that\n  \nIf you give a triple prefix argument to org-agenda-refile, the agenda will not be rebuilt.\n  \nWhich is great, and good to know, but does not help me, since I want to keep using bulk actions.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/29nullvier  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using org-wild-notifier (within Spacemacs) for a while and I realized it was actually draining my laptop batter quite a bit. The core reason is that once a minute it spawns a separate emacs instance that has to initialize a bunch of things and actually (re)open all org agenda files I already had opened and regenerate org-agenda.\n Which led me to dig around and look at https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async (which wild-notifier uses) and then read a bit about https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NoThreading.\n I also went through https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html a bit (I only have a few agenda files and they are not huge, though I am toying with the idea of testing cleanup to see how much it would help)\n Ultimately though, it feel like the emacs-async use in this case will always cause slowdowns. Doing some profiling - even the call to package-initialize in org-wild-notifier--retrieve-events takes a sizeable chunk of CPU.\n These seem like wasted cycles, my emacs instance already has the org files open and all the packages needed loaded.\n So, finally my question is - am I the only one that is bothered by this? Do people not want/need notifications generally? Or not get hit by the battery drain for some reason? How do others deal with getting notifications before events/tasks are scheduled/planned?\n I looked a bit at https://github.com/legalnonsense/org-timed-alerts and I like the approach using org-ql potentially nice(r). Especially with caching and all of that... But the package doesn't seem maintained anymore so I think it's a dead end?\n Alternatively would changing wild-notifier to use emacs threads potentially solve/improve this? (at the cost of newer emacs version requirement).\n Any other suggestions (other than trying to cleanup my org agenda files)?\n Edit: Fix double spaced-paragraphs\n    submitted by    /u/podtatranec  \n [link]   [comments]",

Notion implements this (in a convoluted manner, IMHO) with what they call \"databases\", which is a table view of all objects of a certain type (i.e.: all note of type \"Human\" are contained in the database \"Humans\").

Namely inbox.org with items from my cellphone using beorg and personal-cal.org and personal-caldav-inbox.org.\n When I put a new first level heading into personal-cal.org or personal-caldav-inbox.org, and tag it with TODO, the items appears in the org-agenda TODO list. When I put the same heading into inbox.org (or any other file I added for testing) it does not.\n I also tried to copy personal-cal.org and put the TODO item in the copy, still it does not appear. So it does not seem to be something inside the files that make them special, it is rather that I somehow set up emacs to only look inside those two files for TODO items.\n But how? The only time I even mention those two files in my config is in the config for caldav:\n ```\n (setq org-caldav-calendars\n '((:calendar-id \"personal\" :files (\"~/org/agenda/personal-cal.org\")\n :inbox \"~/org/agenda/personal-caldav-inbox.org\")\n )\n )\n ```\n I commented those two lines but this does not change anything for the TODO list.\n ​\n // nevermind, I found it\n    submitted by    /u/Schievel1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey friends,\n I'm new at this so I apologize if my lingo is off! I'm starting to migrate my configs to org files where I can use Babel to tangle. I also use GNU Stow for individual packages so everything is sym-linked from a master .dotfiles dir.\n For those that do this or something similar, I'm wondering, do you keep the org files in a git repo, or just the dotfiles? If both in a repo, do you keep them together?\n Also, because I have some per system configs where how the dotfiles will be tangled will depend on some evaluated code in my org files. I can't wrap my head around how that won't create problems for version control since the code will change depending on the machine. I guess the dotfiles can be in different git branches, but if the evaluated results in the org files themselves will be changing depending on the system, won't that pose a problem for version control as well?\n Hope this makes sense!

For example, I've got a full time job, a part time job (which really just connects to my full time job... long story), an addiction to businesses, investments, books I'm reading, a home, a truck, a car... you get the idea)... \n So, being crazy busy, crazy spread thin half the time and needing to keeps notes has always been a challenge.\n I'm just curious if someone could share their methods of organizing their org mode files. I've kind of ended up with a bunch of files (atleast I was smart enough to leave them all in one place). I'm also taking to using agenda as well, which adds some challenges as well I would think, but I'm not sure.\n ​\n I guess maybe I don't fully understand org organization just yet. Maybe someone can offer some insight?\n I should note I also use Plain Org on iPhone, mainly because it's the only one I found that I could sync with anything other than dropbox/google drive/ webdav.

What do you use to capture tasks on mobile and outside of emacs on the desktop and what are your syncing strategies for when new tasks are added to a .org file (preferably without manual commits, ... )?

More like, \"How do I do all that grown-up stuff like food, water, shelter, and so on? \n Obstinately pursuing something that peaks your interest can be a bad idea, especially if you never really find it and can't really figure out how to live with it.

I've tried setting line-prefix to a tab, but even with tab-width 2, that's a bit too much.\n Alternatively, I'm happy with any other way to add a space between the display-line-numbers section and my code.\n    submitted by    /u/your_sweetpea  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am trying to figure out a good workflow for Emacs + ESS for R. For interactive data analysis it's nice to make a lot of plots and RStudio has a nice panel for these. But ESS, at least by default, uses X, which is not nice:\n - plotting happens in the XQuartz application, which means that I need to switch out of Emacs and requires a whole bunch of keypresses and thought that I don't want to deal with; at most a window (or multiple as appropriate) should open which I close it with cmd-w and return to emacs, without having to switch applications.\n - plots aren't interactive. In python, for example, you can adjust the plot and save it from the figure window (although the plot window also switches apps and for that reason is not ideal).\n Is this the standard R plotting workflow on macOS (or for that matter Linux)? How do people handle making a lot of plots, on the fly, using ESS? Any other related workflow tips are also helpful. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/progthw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found lsp-rename which allow renaming a function in the whole project but I couldn't find equivalent to the \"Move refactoring\" function of IntelliJ, which would allow moving a folder in one go.\n Is there anyway to achieve this in Emacs?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/m-gregoire  \n [link]   [comments]",

It sometimes looks like Emacs would undo and redo buffer switch/window switch multiple times or randomly remove/insert the text I just wrote. :O\n I can also reproduce this behavior in plain Emacs (emacs -Q).

          "description": "I made an elisp function for parsing some org table-like data in a buffer. My function scans each line of the buffer, and depending on the characters at the start of the line, it jumps to a certain point in the line and inserts some text. The relevant part of the function is below:\n (beginning-of-buffer) (while (not (eobp)) (cond ((looking-at header-re-1) (search-forward marker1 nil nil count1) (insert text1)) ((looking-at header-re-2) (search-forward marker2 nil nil count2) (insert text2)) ((looking-at header-re-3) (search-forward marker3 nil nil count3) (insert text3)) (t)) (forward-line)) \n My function works okay, but it seems a little inelegant, because the cond consists of three blocks of looking-at followed by search-forward followed by insert, only with different arguments each time. Is there a more clever way to do this that only needs one call to looking-at, search-forward, and insert, using something like, say pcase?\n    submitted by    /u/cottasteel  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It's great that C-n/C-p (n/p) are \"standard\" bindings for moving up and down lines/lists/etc. across many modes. But there are many situations where you aren't navigating a flat list, but rather a \"tree\" of information, with more than one depth level. E.g. code (lispy and friends, many programming modes, tree-sitter structural editing), collapsable sections (e.g. magit), nested outlines (org), heading outlines (outshine), etc. Here, the different modes all seem to define different navigation commands and bindings.\n It would be wonderful if there were a set of \"standard\" bindings for tree-movement: \n  \namong siblings at the same level (j,k in lispy; b, f with org-speed commands)\n up a level forward/backward (h,l in lispy; u with org-speed)\n to the next/previous thing in the tree regardless of level (f from either \"side\" of an sexp in lispy, p, n with org speed commands).\n \n Probably too late to find any common set of keys that would work across existing modes, but it would still be nice to have a consistent set going forward. Opinions? Anyone find the same mismatch and come up with a workable solution?\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

Few times I also got an option C-r (I believe it was called rebase buffer) that reverted the buffer AND reapplied my changes. \n My question is: Do you know how is this C-r option triggered or how I could recreate it?

          "description": "I've got two questions rolling around today and I can't seem to sort either of them. First, I'm trying to setup my home emacs configuration based (loosely) on my work configuration, but doing it entirely through use-package instead of the Emacs package management. As a result, I'm not entirely sure dependencies are being installed though I understand they ought to be. In any event I've got a behavior on my work machine that I have not yet been able to get on my home machine, namely when I start typing a path in a string, I get completion on it based on the filesystem. Here's a picture, hopefully. \n In any event, I have company and company-statistics installed in both locations but I don't think that's what's doing the file completion suggestions. Any ideas what is causing that? \n Second question, there is a package that has a built-in version installed, however the gnu repository has a more recent version. If I use use-package to install, it says the package is already installed. Is there a way to force it to update if there's a newer version, or something along those lines? I am new to use-package and really haven't gotten the full swing of it yet. I also have a newer version that I just had to download from a site and in the past have just used adding a directory onto load-path and then (require '<package name>) which works, but would be interesting to sort out whether that behavior can be done with use-package as well as a shortcut.\n Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will invest more as I find time. Currently, only one thing bugs me: Emacs looks terrible. \n All the customization posts and resources are in-depth. I only want a better look. I don't want anything else, no keybindings nothing. Just regular emacs/org-mode that looks nicer (e.g., a dark theme, some prettier font maybe, etc.). \n So, I want to borrow someone else's minimal (just better looks) customization. I don't know how to implement it but I hope it's just a matter of replacing a vanilla file with the borrowed one or pasting some code in one of the vanilla files. \n Believe me I'm trying to learn it all but in my current workload there's like several years before I can get to the point of customizing it myself.

Here is a quick test: ``` mkdir -p /tmp/test-project/vendor echo \"Hello\" > /tmp/test-project/file echo \"Hello\" > /tmp/test-project/vendor/file\n Create .projectile so Emacs recognize folder as project\n touch /tmp/test-project/.projectile ```\n Now, in Emacs, after going inside the project, projectile-find-file shows the vendor directory.\n describe-variable does show \"vendor\" in the projectile-globally-ignored-directories list.\n I've found some contradictory information whether this should work or not with the hybrid indexation: - From this comment (https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/976#issuecomment-431711176), I understand I have to use .gitignore? - But from an issue I opened https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/6504, I understand it should?\n I've tried as much debugging as my Lisp skills allows so any help you be appreciated!\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/m-gregoire  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's almost perfect for me with bash(1) scripts - the only sand in the vaseline is that next-error skips over shellcheck(1) 'notes' and only points me at 'warnings' and worse.

Use a directive to specify location. [SC1090] \n I would like next-error to visit occurrences of 'note's as well as more serious blues. Do I need to futz with next-error-function? If so, does anyone have the code for that? \n Or perhaps there's some way to have shellcheck(1) promote 'notes' to 'warnings'?\n Here's my miserable code:\n (defun bh:check-syntax () \"Check syntax for various languages.\" (interactive) (when (eq major-mode 'lisp-mode) (progn (emacs-lisp-byte-compile))) (when (eq major-mode 'sh-mode) (compile (format \"bash -n %s && shellcheck -f gcc %s\" buffer-file-name buffer-file-name) t)) (when (eq major-mode 'ruby-mode) (shell-command (format \"ruby -c %s\" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'python-mode) (shell-command (format \"python -B -m py_compile %s\" buffer-file-name))) (when (eq major-mode 'awk-mode) (shell-command (format \"gawk --source 'BEGIN { exit(0) } END { exit(0) }' --file %s\" buffer-file-name)))) (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'bh:check-syntax) \n * the sub-discussion was about disabling flycheck as it's just too distracting - I prefer to do linting on save, and so do others, apparently.\n    submitted by    /u/StrangeAstronomer  \n [link]   [comments]",

After all to get this done I ended up with a \"LineWalker\" class wrapping the full text to convert that had of necessity a small subset of what is in elisp for text buffer manipulation, walking and transformation.\n So I am curious the community here has at hand some pointers to text information transformers wholly in elisp. And I am curious whether transformation in place in text buffer is often done or usually transformation into another buffer. \n So many bread and butter programming tasks involve transformation of text to some other text. Heck, compiling a program in transformation of text to different text or binary. So the breadth of such tasks is larger than it first seems. \n    submitted by    /u/s3r3ng  \n [link]   [comments]",

The addon is based on incremental reading (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading) so you can add different articles to a priority queue that you can pull up to decide what to read next. I attached two screenshots below to help understand what I am talking about.\n ​\n Anyways, I'm super new to emacs and don't really know how I would go about doing this in emacs. Any tips? \n ​\n I'd like to be able to have the priority features in the addon, i.e. 1-100 priority scheduling, show in [n] days, show on weekdays, set a directory for files and see all files that aren't currently in the queue, but I realize this may be pretty hard so I'd settle for just being able to add and remove links to a queue with some basic priority. \n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/ohcc2glffp791.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=40c2c2777d525df480f7be333dc0932beafe8191\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/290wxbx5fp791.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3f5b5b03207fe159e6f2e8a94b85f0a4fa15e0\n    submitted by    /u/nick91700  \n [link]   [comments]",

Emacs already offers a lot of development tools, that i think work really well together, like (warning, long list ahead):\n version control (magit), web browser (eww), email client, text editing, terminal, plugin (package) manager, documentation, calculator, remote file system access (tramp), org more, and most importantly, powerful configuration system (elisp), and definitely more.\n Compared to emacs, vscode (yes im comparing emacs to vscode, bite me) only has 40% percent of these features. But there is one thing that vscode does better than emacs, and that is code editing. Vscode, has built in lsp, with fast, consistent auto code completion with good completion results, fast documentation, with easy to install plugins here and there. Emacs auto code completion makes typing typing feel laggy, the completions results are a bit worse, programing in different languages feels not as consistent, and setting up all the stuff is more tedious.\n All i'm saying is that i think emacs users would benefit a lot, if we had these features built in into emacs, with good, out of a box, experience, as most of us are programmers. And it would probably take a lot of effort for emacs devs to implement something like this, but why not.\n Thanks for reading my [almost] rant, have a nice day :D\n    submitted by    /u/BlackberryPerfect938  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello r/emacs. I am in dire need of your assistance. My main hobbies are writing and playing around with programming. I am not particularly good at either, but I was drawn to emacs after seeing people post about how great it is as both an IDE and a word processor.\n Over the last two weeks, I have scoured the internet trying to learn more about emacs. I configured spacemacs, and then switched to doom emacs. I have learned the basics of org mode and org-roam. And even though it's been a much steeper learning curve than I expected, I have really loved it so far.\n However, I am stuck on one particular issue that is maddening and crippling my ability to use emacs the way I want. And that issue is almost enough to make me want to give up.\n The problem is formatting. Eventually, I need to be able to output this to a word or a PDF doc in double spaced times new Roman font. And while I know that there are a myriad of ways to do that, I am struggling to find a way that works while making my words in emacs not completely unreadable.\n As it stands now, if I tab or add spaces to indent my paragraphs, emacs will behave more like a programming text editor and indent the whole block of text. It looks fine if I copy it into libre word, but makes for tough writing in emacs itself\n If I add a space to break up paragraphs in emacs (a new line character), then I am stuck with an undesired extra space when I put it in libre word, and I can't figure out an easy way to search and delete those extra lines in word itself.\n I am not very good at configuring emacs, but I am trying to learn. Unfortunately, this one issue has made me almost want to give up completely even though I definitely see the advantages this software could offer. I feel like I am fighting with the system more than actually producing creative work.\n If anyone has any good advice on how to solve this, I would appreciate it. I know the solution is there, but I have yet to find it in my searches of YouTube and Google.\n    submitted by    /u/eburkhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

In that discussion, some prefer eglot because it feels more unobtrusive and faithful to Emacs built-ins compared to lsp-mode—so eglot is a legitimate alternative to lsp-mode.\n Debugging is a different story. Really, the only viable debugging tools (that aren't for elisp) in Emacs are dap-mode and gud and its rewrite, realgud. Though the debugging adapter protocol (dap) can be reimplemented for eglot, it would take a lot of effort, so it likely won't manifest anytime soon. Consequently: if you want to use dap, then you have to use lsp-mode.\n But how is gud/realgud? It's almost never spoken of these days due to the popularity of lsp-mode/dap-mode. Of course, the tools are very different, but does anyone still think gud/realgud can be treated as a genuine alternative to dap-mode (barring preferences in UI)?

Is there any such module? \n Apart from this, people use notion for easy document markup and linking pages. I think org mode does this so much better. The markup is simple and great and also allows to link to other pages. Almost everything else notion does, emacs does better. But the database thing is where notion seems to excel at. I also heard software like airtable provide small, noob friendly databases.\n    submitted by    /u/LowCom  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get sane defaults, updates on new packages and ecosystems like vertico/marginalia/consult etc., and a nice way to keep it all up to date. \n Thank you u/hlissner, and thank you to all who contribute. Your efforts are truly appreciated by so many. I just bought Henrik a couple coffees, and if you have the means and have enjoyed using doom as much as I have maybe consider doing the same. And if you are newer to the emacs scene and your emacs-fu chops are as weak as mine, I highly recommend giving doom a go, and know that you can turn vim/evil key bindings off and still get all the benefits of a community maintained repo of awesome packages if you want to (although I am now a converted evil boi) :)\n    submitted by    /u/azfrak  \n [link]   [comments]",

The same command also also accepts regex without the need to have seperate command for that.\n Emacs uses query search and replace which prompts 2 times for the main text and then the text to replace. And then if you want to use regex to replace, you have to use a different command. \n Command to kill buffer prompts for which buffer to kill, although almost always you want to kill the current one.\n :bd just kills the current buffer in vim. \n Many alt-x commands prompt too much asking for each argument, instead of just allowing all the arguments to be entered in one line. \n I know some of these can be customised and eliminated but this seems to be a general trend. I read that one of the vim design principles was to prompt user as little as possible allowing user to do much non interactively while emacs seems to encourage lot of spoon feeding to new/ begginer users.\n Not to mention, settting the option of shorter prompts (y or n instead of yes and no), disabling some prompts made my emacs experience much better. Also disabling the splash screen, startup tutorial, and changing the scratch buffer message to something much shorter.

What attracted me to org-roam in the first place is that with back-linking, if I ever read my note on \"transmigration of souls\" (say, encounter it in another book) in the future, I see that it was referenced in this book (and whatever other sources).\n How would I go about turning an ebook into \"org-roam\" file that I could then link from and too (as in books that reference each other). I also seek to use \"org-roam\" files as books to allow grepping/annotating/etc.\n If I am doing this incorrectly, asking the wrong question, or misusing the concept behind org-roam please let me know.

I am trying to understand: \n  \nhow to move the annotation (and the associated contents and editing) windows to the left rather than the right\n how I can control their widths\n how I can make the modeline in the windows go away without disturbing the very nice black outline that surrounds them (using hide-mode-line does this...)\n  \nIf you have some clues/tips/configurations that might be helpful, please do share!\n    submitted by    /u/cellular--automaton  \n [link]   [comments]",

This appears to be the most recent version built.\n I have set the \"Default Font\" using the interactive menus and by editing the .emacs file directly. In either case what I think are the appropriate values are saved in .emacs but when I start the GUI version of Emacs, it opens with a small font, gets momentarily larger as I've specified in my .emacs file, but only for a split second. Then it changes again to a small font.\n I have reduced the .emacs file to contain only the custom-set-faces function, and still see this behavior. I have no idea what is causing this to happen. I am using the same function in an Emacs install on Windows 10, and on the current release of MacOS successfully, both have a more recent version of Emacs however.\n Here is what was in the minimum .emacs file that caused the undesired behavior:\n (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. '(default ((t (:family \"DejaVu Sans Mono\" :foundry \"PfEd\" :slant normal :weight normal :height 241 :width normal))))) \n Any suggestions of what to look into?

The lines in /etc/hosts end up looking something like this:\n 74.125.142.109 smtp.gmail2.com 74.125.142.109 smtp.gmail3.com \n At that point I just say to Gnus that my outgoing server is using the gmail2, or gmail3 server, etc. Problems with this are for some of my outgoing servers on dynamic IPs that periodically change, meaning that I need to change my etc/hosts file to keep up with their changes. The other problem builds on this since I changed to guix, when changing my etc hosts isn't as trivial as it once was, this is constructed from guix reconfigure, which can be more time consuming.

I first heard of Zettelkasten after a few coworkers of mine were talking about personal knowledge systems. I read everything under \"Getting Started\" on this site plus others, and even bought (and read) the book about taking smart notes.\nI started blogging over a decade ago and already see the massive assistance my Zettelkasten provides even with only a few zettels (about 70 fully formed zettels currently). Not only does it help with my blog but it's help with creating content both for public social networks as well as my online store.\nNeedless to say, I'm a convert and taking my time building up a Zettelkasten for my brain to work within. I'm currently using Obsidian for the software but am thinking about creating a software myself to fit my exact needs. But we'll see... creating software is a lot of work... 😅\nHappy Zettel'n!",

A fluke find from Atomic Habits to Deep Work to Smart Notes resulting in crash learning how to get started in Obsidian.\nMany years ago a science degree, now as a 60's something student, just finished a Bachelor of Visual Arts (Hons) I am moving on to a Ph.D (preparation mode at present). During Honours I held way too much information in my head, bounced from art journals for drawing, bullet journals, todo lists and adhoc method of note taking and Mendeley for references.\nAfter a couple of months preparatory reading I have multitudes of ideas but have frozen at the writing/note taking point, word docs and OneNote are resulting in dead notes that I know in a couple of years wont serve me well. Zettelkasten is how my head so I am hoping this will be a game changer.\nIf anyone else is in the process of working on their Ph.D thesis  I would love to know how you use your Zettelkasten, do you keep it purely for creative notes or use folders etc to track authors, titles etc to ensure you have covered your lit review requirements?

          "description": "There are some nice posts in the Transitioning links from Obsidian to the Archive thread on distracting environments, particularly this post by @sfast that mentions an experiment in which simply having a smartphone in the same room was detrimental to working memory.\nI'm not a current user of The Archive, but am drawn towards it due to the philosophy of being a focused, minimally distracting environment. But I am particularly interested in how people handle digital distraction beyond simply app choice. Personally I feel like the modern operating system lends itself to distraction so much, that app choice is actually minimally relevant.\nEven were I to use The Archive for example, my brain is wired by now to hit Cmd+Space and start typing the name of my browser, to hit Cmd+t while in a browser and start typing the name of a distracting website without thought, to swipe left and right on the trackpad to switch between multiple apps on multiple desktops and so on. Even with enough disciple to avoid those things, as @sfast points out, just resisting them is using up working memory itself.\nWhere a tool like Obsidian encourages some background mental processing simply due to the complexity of options that are available, even if you're making an effort not to use them. The whole OS feels like this to me x10, kind of nullifying the benefits of a focused environmental like The Archive.\nIt doesn't help that I have ADHD, and am just young enough to have grown up with social media, so these behaviours were hard wired into my developing brain.\nI would like to use The Archive for all the many advantages it provides, but I'm almost tempted to go the route of a physical Zettelkasten simply to be able to work in a room with no devices.\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this topic, and how to manage digital distraction particularly in a desktop environment?",

          "description": "Hello zettelkasten forums!\nI've just recently gotten started with the zettelkasten method, and I find it intriguing and I'm looking forward to seeing how it affects my life, as I have ADHD and it's very easy for me to pick up knowledge and then later lose it due to time away from a subject, and it looks to me as though the zettelkasten method will help me with that.\nI've noticed one \"problem\" as I've started with it however. I've seen the expression that people's zettelkasten are \"hungry\" and need to be \"fed\", and having started to use the method I like the expression a lot, it feels appropriate. Whenever I start writing notes it feels as if everything I say has branching possibilities for things that I should make additional notes on.\nFor example, I am a software engineer, and unlike most of my other interests my knowledge in this domain has remained solid for a long time because it's the topic I spend the most time in. So far I haven't put any notes into my zettelkasten on topics of software because I'm concerned that it will become a huge issue of time. I have accumulated much knowledge in the ~15 years I've spent building software, and I feel like if I put down the first note I won't be able to stop feeding the beast for a very long time.\nSo I would like to ask two questions: first, how do you all decide on a stopping point when writing and cope with the fact that there's more you could write, and second, how do you keep track of places that you know you could expand on later but have decided not to do so yet in such a way as to allow yourself to come back to it later during some time you have set aside to feed your zettelkasten?",

Hi!\nIn any event, I'm wondering how you maintain \"rhythm\" or momentum while reading \"as if writing is all that matters\". I find that, as soon as I started reading with the intention of creating notes, my reading pace comes to a screeching halt, and I never finish anything I start. Alternatively, I read and only mark interesting ideas, but then I find the process of turning them all into notes overwhelming and I never do that. I suspect I'm trying to take too many notes, but maybe there's some better process I could use. Help?\nWhat's your system?",
