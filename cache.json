I'm looking to answer the following questions:\n Is there any standard practice/convention for putting test data files? For JVM projects following Maven directory structure, the location is src/test/resources, but AFAICT, there's no such convention in Haskell. So, putting the files inside the test directory, presumably under the same module path, makes sense to me.\n For example, If the code under test is in the module A.B, then putting the test data in the directory test/A/B is fine. If using HSpec, the test module is A.BSpec.\n How to read the test data files? There's no need to list these files in the cabal file, because these are't going to be shipped with the package. Simple readFile test/A/B/file.txt from the test works.\n Can anyone please confirm/correct the above statements?\n    submitted by    /u/sarkara1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently learning Haskell, and I'm practicing doing the Advent of Code 2023.\n I'm a bit struggling with the performance of my solution for 2023 day 6, part 2.\n At first, here's the solution I did a month ago in Go: main.go. Basically, I iterate from 1 to raceTime, and count the number of times where applying a function is bigger than a specific value. Note that raceTime can be pretty big (in my case it's 55826490). The result is executed in a few milliseconds.\n I did the same in Haskell: Main.hs:\n ``` numberOfWays :: Int -> Int -> Int numberOfWays time distance = foldl' (\\acc i -> acc + (travelDistance i time distance)) 0 [1 .. (time - 1)]\n travelDistance :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int travelDistance hold raceTime distance = if (raceTime - hold) * hold > distance then 1 else 0 ```\n At first, I used fold and I had a stack overflow. I read here and there what the issue was so I switched to foldl'. Yet, this version runs in more than 20 seconds compared to only a few milliseconds in Go.\n I'm not at all comparing Haskell and Go, but I'm trying to understand what makes my solution so slow and how to improve it. Note that I have seen versions in O(1), fair enough but I don't want to implement a solution with better time complexity. I'd like to stick with an O(n) solution for now, to understand what I'm doing wrong.\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/teivah  \n [link]   [comments]",

MyConstraint t \n Basically, I have some function f which for a given kind k (or at least a given list of types of kind k) needs to know that all types belonging to that kind (or in that list) satisfy some constraint. Conveniently, I can express this using QuantifiedConstraints, and make properly make use of that constraint in the function's body. The problem is that I never seem to be able to call that function in a way that it satisfies this quantified constraint, and I don't know how to tell Haskell that it does actually satisfy this constraint forall t :: Foo in this case. Any ideas/suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/Naughty_Noot  \n [link]   [comments]",

Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.\n This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You're just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.\n    submitted by    /u/ThyringerBratwurst  \n [link]   [comments]",

Am I going in the right direction here?\n In spirit of the X-Y problem, what I am trying to solve is a reader on a socket forkIO $ forever (recvFrom sock 512 >>= doSth) should be interruptible and I should be able to interrupt this \"blocking\" wait on the thread.

You could solve this by using different schemas or database or whatever else but we have Haskell at our disposal, so let's focus (but not constrain) the discussion on that.\n The goals are:\n  \nMake it very hard (but maybe not impossible) for tenants to access each other's data\n End up with a convenient interface\n Use an already established DB library\n  \nI've worked on a few projects with such multi tenancy and have never really been \"satisfied\" with how we've done this.\n Project 1 used template Haskell to generate \"repository\" code that had the filtering built-in. We were lucky enough that for our usecase this was fine. TH was not very pleasant to use and the approach is rather limiting.\n Project 2 was simply relying on the developers to not forget to add the appropriate filter.\n Project 3 uses a custom database library that has quite a lot of type level wizardry but it basically boils down to attaching the tenant id filter at the end of each query. The downside is that we basically need to reimplement everything that already exists in established DB libraries from scratch. Joins are a pain so we resort to SQL views for more complicated queries.\n Is there an established way people go about this?

Most of the problems involve searching/traversal of the graph, and I'm pretty confused about how to approach the solutions idiomatically. I'm looking for some help in evaluating one the following options:\n  \nBasic recursion: Pass the state around during recursive calls, and use if-then-else to prune/terminate as necessary. This is the simplest choice, but results in similar-looking boilerplate code. \n Same as above but using the State monad.\n Model a search problem as a tuple of (start value, expanding frontier function, terminating condition), and provide implementations of the 2nd and 3rd items for each algorithm. This model is shown here and looks promising in reducing boilerplate.\n Read a novel academic paper, like Structuring Depth-First Search Algorithms in Haskell or Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers and come up with an implementation. FWIW, it seems like the Data.Graph library implementation is based on the former paper (but for the purposes of the exercise I shouldn't use).\n Logic and Continuation: This option is mentioned in passing in some places but there is exactly zero online literature available as far as any practical examples go. None whatsoever. I don't even know why would I choose this option, other than it potentially reducing boilerplate. The H-99 problems aren't for infinite graphs, and ask for all answers, not the first one, so, fairness/interleaving isn't really a concern.\n  \nA somewhat related question had been asked before, although it focussed on a specific advent of code problem and lacked the research I've laid out above. Nothing against the question, just saying that the comments there don't preempt my question.\n What would be the most elegant option?

I love the idea of doing it in Haskell and also doing it properly™ (i.e. overengineering the hell outta it lol).\n I already have a program (involuntarily written in Java) to store/output the board state and determine whether someone won.\\ What I intend to create is the following: 1. a protocol between the Java program and 2. (see below)\\ this will contain things like \"NEWGAME\", \"TURN xy\", \"RESPONSE zw\", etc. 2. a Haskell program that implements that protocol to actually generate a good next move and send it back to the Java application, which 3. I will modify to be able to talk to my \"engine\"\n So what is your folks' opinion on how to structure the Haskell code / protocol?\\ I came up with this: - CECP-/UCI-like protocol: one move sent at a time, my program would need to store that somehow\\ however, I don't have any idea on how to elegantly do this in Haskell and wonder whether it can even be done idiomatically - get the complete board state as input each time and output the next move / new state; as easy as it gets and seems to fit really well with the functional paradigm BUT extremely inefficient and not what I would do if I was programming it in another language (also apparently not how most protocols work…)\n Dear, epic, most valued, mathematically blessed computer scientists, can you bestow some advice upon me, so I can maybe become worthy of joining your ranks one day?\n Thanks in advance and happy holidays! :)\n    submitted by    /u/TheKiller36_real  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Haskellers,\n I have a question about streaming libraries (streamly, conduit, streaming, etc.). I am trying to write a little application to remap user input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) so I am dealing with low-volume, lazy streams. Additionally, the actual remapping will depend on a user configuration file. \n I have gotten suggestions to use a streaming library to represent the basic datatype in my app, something I did look into but quickly abandoned because of a rather daunting amount of choice and considerations. However, now is the time for me to make a decision, since going back and refactoring everything after the fact is going to be a huge time-sink. So:\n I am currently under the impression that the biggest benefit of the streaming libraries is speed, and that that speed is generated by doing ghc-optimization tricks. I am also under the impression that speed is not that important in my domain, and that since I don't know which stream-transformations I will be composing at compile time (since I'll be reading the transformations from user-config), I wouldn't even be able to benefit from these performance gains.\n Is my understanding correct? Am I missing something? My home-rolled solution uses binary and a Chan and async to set up different event readers by parsing from lazy bytestrings, writing to the chan to merge the results, and then represents the input as a lazy, infinite list that then gets passed to my pure remapping engine. It seems to work fine. Am I setting myself up for some unforeseen disaster in the future? \n The reason I've been avoiding these solutions is also just because my productive time is limited and very unreliable, so the cognitive overhead of a completely new set of abstractions comes with its own cost.\n Thank you for any advice you may proffer.\n    submitted by    /u/janssen_dhj  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want the type signatures in the API to be as clean as possible, and avoid the need for so many type ascriptions in code using the API, which is why I'd like to make this work somehow.\n I have a typeclass A with a non injective associated type Context\n class A a where type Context a \n so many instances of A can have the same Context.\n Some instances of A are also instances of the class AA, that has two additional associated types, B and C.\n class (A a) => AA a where type B a type C a problematic :: Context a -> B a -> C a -> a \n The intention is that given a Context, the combination of B a and C a uniquely identify a, but I don't know how to express this.\n I know it's possible to make constraints like\n class A a where type B a = b | b -> a \n , but what I need is some kind of constraint with multiple parameters, like (Context a, B a, C a) -> a.

          "description": "This is a recurring issue for me when I do Advent of Code, which I do in Haskell - some problems are really suited for using memoization. I tried to condense my confusion to as close to the pain point as possible, and I am hoping someone here can help me understand where my thinking goes wrong. Here is a code block with a few different ways of calculating a Fibonacci sequence:\n import Data.Function.Memoize main :: IO () main = do -- slow print $ fib 35 -- fast print $ fibMemo 35 -- slow print $ (memoize fibMemo2) 35 fib :: Int -> Int fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) fibMemo :: Int -> Int fibMemo = memoize fib' where fib' 0 = 1 fib' 1 = 1 fib' n = fibMemo (n-1) + fibMemo (n-2) fibMemo2 :: Int -> Int fibMemo2 0 = 1 fibMemo2 1 = 1 fibMemo2 n = (memoize fibMemo2) (n-1) + (memoize fibMemo2) (n-2) \n Note here that two functions are really slow - both the first and last one. But in my mind, the second one (which is fast) is exactly the same as the third one (which is slow). What is the difference here?

Long story short was: he created the users with their password so he knew their authentication infos and was able to login in order to \"see what they can see\", \"check for missing features directly on their account\", \"test out that some specific features would really work for them\" in production, etc.\n But! I changed the way users are created, mainly because the passwords he created were way too easy to guess (without even having to brute force, litteraly everyone could guess the passwords, that's why he could remember them in the first place).\n So he can't login as other users anymore, and he would like to be able to \"do it again\". I already worked on a platform that allowed user impersonation for administrators out of the box but I can't find anything on the internet regarding this subject on the Play framework and Scala documentations or their communities...\n So my questions for you are: have you ever had to deal with an impersonation feature request using silhouette + play framework + scala and if you haven't, do you have any advice to provide on the subject anyway? =D\n Thanks very much for those who take the time to respond!\n EDIT: added essential politeness to my post\n    submitted by    /u/DespicableHarpoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I allocated max. 12GB to the VM running IntelliJ\n What I am experiencing?\n When I edit scala files in a small size Scala project (roughly 40 files, scala source code + few files generated from the play framework) using playframework 3 & anorm, basically IntelliJ goes nuts, i.e. the CPU usage goes up, the fans rpm go to the maximum (I run TG Pro) to the point where I cannot type continuously - I keep typing, and the characters don't show up for a few fractions of second, then they all appear at once. Clicking anywhere in the editor or in the user interface has a lag. I am using the default JDK that comes with IntelliJ. Cmd+Tab doesn't respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.\n I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don't like it as much as IntelliJ.\n I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.\n I am just curious about few things if you don't mind sharing your experience:\n  \ndo you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don't run it on apple hardware?\n if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?\n any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?\n  \nAnd just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16\" intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlUmnVYPcKM .\n Thank you\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/0110001001101100  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I observed lately that there is a lot of division in Scala community. There are multiple groups of users, some more vocal than others.\n This is counterproductive as people have different requirements, tastes, styles, and backgrounds.\n In my view, this goes against what Scala stands for, a Scalable language:\n \"A programming language designed to adapt to the evolving needs of its users.\"\n However, not all users have the same requirements. There is no one solution for everyone.\n Is there a way in 2024 to make the Scala community more inclusive and accept that every group has its pros and cons for the technical choices they make?\n Here are some groups I observed, mainly around async handling:\n  \nPeople who try to write everything with IO.\n People who keep using Scala Future.\n People who use plain threads / scala-async / project Loom / direct style.\n  \nWhile you may have a preference for one group, we should all agree that there is nothing wrong with choosing one or another. It's just a matter of personal preference and the overall requirements and trade-offs.\n It's essential to recognise that outside the Scala community, some of these paradigms represent the majority.\n For example, Scala Future behave the same as the Kotlin CompletableFuture, the Java CompletableFuture, the NodeJS Promise.\n What's nice about each group is that people coming from Haskell/familiar with IO monad may be at home in group 1.\n People coming from Java/Kotlin/Javascript will be at home in groups 3 and 2.\n People coming from Python will be at home in group 3.\n So, instead of being consumed by division. Can the community be joined by the diversity and cooperation instead?\n It's a Scalable language where everyone can be at home. We all have to win with Scala being a multi-purpose language as it was intended.\n Much love to each of the groups, have a wonderful day!\n    submitted by    /u/Previous_Pop6815  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of using a tool to turn stones into gold, you can just pick gold...\n And Cats can't make pure gold for you, because there is no linting tool in Scala to enforce the purity.

          "description": "There are things about data engineering I've really enjoyed, but after 2 years it has started to become quite stale and boring. The part of the job I have enjoyed the most is when I get to work with python and spark (the more software engineery stuff with data engineering). So given that scala is the language spark was written in, and what many data engineers had been using for a long time (and some still do), I decided it could be worthwhile learning.\n Also, I'd really like to transition into a more software engineering centric role in my next job, and have been learning Scala as a means by which to achieve this. My logic was that if I learn Scala the worst case scenario is that I get better at coding, (data engineering with python will only take you so far in terms of developing software engineering skills), and even though it is dying out as a language for DE in favour of python, it might help with employability for DE jobs. The upside is I may be able to get a Scala Developer/Engineer role that pays better, and which I may be better suited to and enjoy more.\n After reading a lot of posts on this subreddit, it seems people are growing increasingly pessimistic regarding the employability of scala, so I wanted some general advice regarding my approach. My current plan has been: Learn Scala -> Personal Projects -> Scala Data Engineer / Scala Engineer -> Scala Engineer/Developer. From what I have seen online Scala Engineer Jobs in my area (London) are very lucrative but I imagine there is a high barrier to entry, and worry that this transition isn't realistic.\n I'm currently working through the Scala RocktheJVM course and am enjoying what I have learnt so far, and will likely continue regardless.

Website is here, code here.\n Besides the code not being the cleanest (beginner programmer – all advice welcome), there's one bug I haven't been able to crush: on Firefox you can accidentally right-click a cleared square and get a context menu popup. This is not desirable, as it at best slows you down and at worst leads to accidentally leaving the page via said menu.\n Relevant code from Main.scala:\n dom.document.addEventListener(\"contextmenu\", e => e.preventDefault()) \n On Chromium things work as expected – no context menu anywhere, ever.\n What I've tried:\n  \nonContextMenu --> { e => e.preventDefault() } literally everywhere: buttons, tbody, table etc.\n onContextMenu --> { e => println(\"here\") } similarly everywhere to find out that when right-clicking a disabled button, nothing on the page seems to receive the pointer event, meaning there's nothing to block it, which then leads to Firefox opening the context menu\n pointer-events: none; for disabled buttons, which breaks things on (at least some) mobile browsers since the browser thinks that a tap on a disabled button was \"really\" meant for its neighbour, which is... not good!\n  \nSo, is this something that needs to be fixed in Firefox, or am I missing something obvious?\n Thanks.\n edit. This is a Firefox bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543196 \n Minimal reproducible example for this particular case just because:\n <!DOCTYPE html> <head> <style> body { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100vh; } </style> </head> <body oncontextmenu=\"return false;\"> <button>No context menu</button> <button disabled=\"true\">Context menu :(</button> </body> </html> \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/scalaccount  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since the orgmode learning curve comes up a lot, I want to make sure it's worth my time. \n I'm a graduate student in applied mathematics. I'm just starting my master's degree, so I'm looking to set up my workflow for classes, research and personal projects. I'd like to be able to quickly and easily create notes on articles, or textbooks, keeping a journal, organize files into projects, create to-do lists and roadmaps (much like orgmode does perfectly if I've understood what I've read correctly).\n I've never used emacs in my life and I don't come from a computer science background --> I find it very difficult to learn and I have the impression that it will be a long time before I can start using it for real. \n People keep saying that it's worth learning emacs and orgmode nonetheless because of the unlimited customization possibilities. What are your thoughts on this? \n Should I be patient and learn to use emacs and orgmode to set up my workflow, or should I just start using Notion or any other simple organization and note-taking app? \n Note that I don't want a complex setup in the long run, just something minimalist that allows me to concentrate on what's important while having a clear vision of my work.\n    submitted by    /u/Pretty-Habit9628  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hej fellows,\n I am using Org Mode while learning about Guix via the fabulous Dissecting Guix series, employing Code blocks to visualize what it is I am talking about. However, I noticed two things that REALLY bug me out.\n First off, when I load the org file containing said source blocks, it is slow to the point of unusability UNLESS I first start GEISER-CONNECT with an instance of GUIX REPL hooked up. This leads me to believe that it is independent of org mode and has to do with the fact that it searches for the code to which the blocks reference. Nonetheless, input on this is highly appreciated\n Second, when I use TAB (for org-cycle), I am asked for the currently used scheme implementation - despite the fact that both related geiser variables, geiser-active-implementation and geiser-default-implementation only contain guile. When I choose guile, then the source block contents become read-only, and all subsequent editing needs to happen in a separate Org Src buffer. I have no clue why this is the case.\n I have come to the point where I commented out all code blocks to not have to deal with it, which is obviously not acceptable in the long run. Thus, any input is appreciated :)\n Have a good day, fellows!\n EDIT/SOLVED: I found out the source of the problem. At one point I had opened a lot of files related to Guix and then saved the Desktop file. Then, loading the file would load all those other files including all modes related. For some reason I don't quite understand this literally ground emacs to a halt performance-wise.\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

Conversely, time tracking only happens at the daily-level and it's never reflected back to the original issue. Also, having tasks as sub-items in the dailies makes it easy to track all tasks by searching for roam back references, but at the same time it creates a lot of duplication because sub tasks are not carried over to the next day for example.\n Here I'm asking for your opinion, because I'm not sure if I'm just using org and roam the \"wrong way\" and I'm not supposed to try to achieve any of this, or if it's a somewhat valid approach and I just need to automate it.\n Thank you all!\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/zuegg  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yet, I found one important issue that keeps bugging me: \n I tried to install org-roam from MELPA, which caused my org to be automatically updated from my current version (9.3) to the more recent one (9.6). \n The problem is, whenever this happens, I lose all my configurations, together with functionality of org-mode, web-mode and other stuff I've installed. Instead, I am greeted by this: (invalid-function org-assert-version), and a message saying there was a problem in loading the configuration file. Running Emacs --debug-init on the terminal would create a long list of errors. The only way to solve this is by going into my ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory and manually removing the files for the updated org mode version.\n For reference, all my configurations are in a ~/.emacs document.\n How can I update org-mode without loosing all my configs?\n Thanks a lot!\n P.S. I'm fairly new to programming and Emacs, sorry if this was not properly oriented or if there is information missing.\n    submitted by    /u/NiceNeedleworker5604  \n [link]   [comments]",

After running C-x C-e after the function (unlike without interactive) I can use M-x double-param but after hitting return it does not wait for input for the parameter. It simply exits with nothing in the echo area. Similarly I cannot use C-u 3 M-x double-param to send it the parameter. However, it still works if I call it with (double-param 3) for example I'll see 6 *#o6, #x6, ?\\C-f) in the echo area.\n What am I doing wrong?

It could perhaps be of interest for some people here. While the Emacs keymap in IntelliJ is actually pretty good, there's enough differences that my Emacs-marinated fingers stumble too often while using IntelliJ. So the plugin is meant to be an extension of the existing Emacs functionality, offering around 40 commands that either modify existing IntelliJ commands to be closer to Emacs, or are pure additions to the IntelliJ commands.\n The plugin only makes these commands available, and you can use whichever ones you find useful, either by adding keybindings one-by-one, or by using the EmacsJ keymap installed by the plugin which is an extension of the Emacs keymap and activates all the commands at once.\n The main features are:\n  \nIncremental search modelled on Emacs' Isearch, with text and regexp search.\n Query-replace as in Emacs with text or regexps, with a very light-weight interface.\n Word commands: transpose, upper-case, lower-case, capitalize, move, delete.\n Rectangle commands: copy, open, clear, paste.\n Whitespace commands: delete space around point, delete empty lines.\n Easy access to clipboard history à la Emacs (kill ring).\n A mark history with ability to pop mark (mark ring), and exchange point and mark.\n Duplicate and comment regions and lines.\n Recenter and relocate caret.\n Zap to character.\n  \n​\n The plugin is of course free and open source.\n https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23181-emacsj\n https://github.com/strindberg/emacsj\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Stindberg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! As a new Emacs user, it seems that I have joined in exciting times with the adoption of treesitter + LSP (which also was my setup in neovim). I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.\n From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.\n I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.\n If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?\n    submitted by    /u/progyam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I've had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn't their fault per se--I'm working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there's a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn't work out.)\n So, two questions:\n  \nCan I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?\n I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they're wrapped up in a namespace. This isn't true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can't jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn't the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don't think it's a fundamental limitation of clangd.\n  \nOther than that, so far, I'm pretty impressed. I'll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I'm missing, but for jumping around the code, it's significantly more performant.\n    submitted by    /u/vjgoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.\n What I'd like to do is, when I'm specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there's a main window with the buffer I'm working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I'd like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to \"normal\" emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.\n Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config? I don't know what it is about Emacs's window manager but each one of these requirements has so many moving pieces in different parts of the system that I just have trouble wrapping my head around the whole.\n    submitted by    /u/Venthorn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I check the load-path and see that lsp-mode is no longer its part, even though it was a user selected package. I do a package-reinstall for it, restart Emacs and it no longer starts: on mac, the icon jumps at the bottom of the screen for a second and goes away. Adding --debug-init isn't helpful. Since my package directory is versioned, I git restore it, and it does not help, neither does deleting the ELN cache.\n Then I wipe my package directory and install user selected packages one by one, and everything goes fine until I get to helm-org. Install it, and Emacs fails to start. Restore an older copy of package directory (not using git restore) which does not have it, Emacs starts.

The Gentoo package manager is written in python and I want to maintain a level of separation between my development environments and the package managers environment. To get lsp-mode and lsp-pyright working, I've created a emacs_venv in my ~/.emacs.d/ folder and then pip installed the lsp-server/pyright stuff to that. Then added that environment to my exec-path and set python-shell-virtual-environment-root to that folder. \n Can I now use direnv to manage project environments? \n Is there a better way to handle separating the Gentoo environment from an environment that emacs needs while in python-mode?\n    submitted by    /u/Usual_Office_1740  \n [link]   [comments]",

They're fine, but I would like to be able to automatically save my desktop every few hours (I use Emacs in daemon mode and basically only close it every 3 weeks or so), rather than manually saving it. Doing (desktop-save-mode 1) seems to have the unfortunate effect of restoring the desktop everytime you restart, unless you explicitally tell Emacs not to.\n Is there an elegant way to have auto-save without auto-restore?\n I have two main ideas:\n  \nEnable desktop-save-mode, but create a shell alias for emacs --no-desktop. This seems fairly straightforward, and I could even add --daemon to the alias since I almost always use that option as well.\n \nCreate a timer for one of the desktop save functions, e.g. bmkp-set-desktop-bookmark. I'm a little unfamiliar with timers in Emacs but this seems like a perfect use-case for them. I could even time-stamp the desktop file name when the save-function is called.\n \n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/nonreligious  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hiya! \n I would like to share with you all a little package package I've written here https://github.com/JasZhe/window-stool for code context. \n There's a few similar packages out there like lsp/eglot breadcrumbs, treesitter-context, and topsy to name a few but most of them use header-line (or in the case of treesitter-context, a childframe) which is limited to a single line.\n I really liked how context.vim had a sort of \"cascading\" context style and I didn't find anything similar to it so I figured I'd give it my own shot here. \n To achieve that, this package uses overlays and so it may not be as performant as others, but I haven't experienced too much slowness personally, even on a pretty old 2017 Macbook. \n It basically constantly moves an overlay to be at the top of the window to act like a pseudo multi-line header-line. I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There's customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I've included a simple one for org-mode using headings. \n In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.\n I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.\n I've been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren't too many issues with others using it, but I'd appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up.

Even SystemCrafters uses it, which to me, is a big vouch for using it.\n However, in reading some other reddit posts about others asking this same question, many people said that it had compatibility issues with some plugins, and relying on vim emulators has always left a bad taste in my mouth from other editors. Also, as a new emacs user, I don’t know how much of the emacs experience changes with evil-mode, and I don’t have the knowledge to be able to thoroughly understand and debug any issues that might come up from using it.\n So, I’m mostly just looking for some affirmation and anecdotes, good and bad, about evil-mode: if it will hurt me as a new user, and generally any heads-ups that could help me.

I suppose the solution to my problem must be fairly easy, but I've only recently started using Emacs for both coding and org mode, and I need some help with my config file.\\\n Basically, I have a \".emacs\" file that I started configuring through tutorials about a month ago. At the time, all I did was assemble together different elisp snippets from different configurations that I found online and liked. Inevitably, I accidentally created a kind of Frankenstein. My main problem is that I have contradictory information in (custom-set-faces) and (custom-theme-set-faces). Now, when I try to change something, it starts accumulating contradictory information and randomly selecting which one to pick.\n I want to clean up my config file, possibly try literate configuration. The problem is that I fear losing all my current configuration and being left with nothing, having to restart from scratch. Can anybody lend me a hand or share some resources?\n Here's my configuration, if you'd like to take a look. Thanks a lot.\n    submitted by    /u/NiceNeedleworker5604  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Over the past decade, pixel density of displays has increased significantly. On Mac, the \"Retina\" display concept represents a doubling of display density, from ~100 to ~200ppi. On HDPI Retina displays, applications are presented with and work in \"virtual\" pixels of 2x2 physical screen pixels, so that font sizes, icons, etc. remain \"normal\". Then raster, vector and font drawing can make use of all the tiny pixels, for higher quality. My question is, how does Emacs on different systems handle HDPI display?\n My build (emacs-mac) provides some limited support for varying DPI. You can provide parallel high-res versions of image files named like file@2x.ext which are substituted for low-DPI images (without the @2x) automatically. You can similarly embed the text property :data-2x in generated image data. But standalone high density images (like Retina screenshots) must be scaled appropriately (often by 0.5x) to \"light all the pixels\" and not appear overly large.\n What do other ports do to accommodate high-DPI? Nothing? Do you just select very large font sizes? What if you have multiple displays with significantly different pixel density connected? How is image display handled? This seems like an area where some coherent treatment and documentation would be very helpful. But perhaps the underlying OS/display systems vary so greatly in their treatment of HDPI it limits this kind of progress?\n    submitted by    /u/JDRiverRun  \n [link]   [comments]",

As the toolkit scrollbars in Emacs are nevertheless handy, I tinkered a bit to solve both problems: * 1: on-demand-scroll-bar-mode is an alternative to scroll-bar-mode that shows vertical scroll bars only when needed https://github.com/florommel/on-demand-scroll-bar * 2: custom-css allows to load arbitrary CSS snippets to style Emacs's GTK widgets. It comes with a dedicated mode to change the scrollbar visuals, as this requires special care. However, you can also adapt all other GTK widgets inside Emacs (menu bar, tool bar, context menus). The package requires a C module to be built and loaded and works only with GTK builds of Emacs. https://github.com/florommel/custom-css\n Both packages are experimental. Of course, they can be used independently from each other.\n    submitted by    /u/florommel  \n [link]   [comments]",

I first stumbled upon Notion, but quickly abandoned it due to its online-only nature. Then I started looking at alternatives like Obsidian and Logseq. Logseq caught my attention since it provided some nice features like daily journaling and \"Everything is a node\" strategy. I liked it. Then I learned that it was a watered down version of Emacs's org-mode. That is when I started looking into Emacs. This was a year ago.\n I fell in love instantly.

Either because I managed to configure something and someone needed help (like typescript on a React environment) or I needed help doing something and I was \"afraid\" of sharing it.\n Unfortunately my dotfile (yes, it was a ~/.emacs file) was ugly, old, slow and full of personal stuff.\n I managed to make it faster (0.6 seconds loadtime with ~95 packages on Linux), somewhat organized and (I hope) free of personal stuff.\n This config focuses on having the SAME (or close) user experience on both TUI and GUI. \n Nowadays you can do things on tmux, for example, and you want to use Emacs as a sole editor with `emacs -nw` (the same fashion Neovim users do), others times you may want Emacs also as your terminal emulator and project organizer, you may want to start several instances of Emacs for gnus, ERC or other stuff, on either TUI or GUI. This config aims this situations, so nothing should be missing from GUI to TUI. You can even start it as a daemon and use at the same time on terminal and GUI without breaking anything.\n On this screenshot we have TUI (left) and GUI (right):\n https://preview.redd.it/esot9k1zw89c1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=c338016527f3c76f235c6e848d6db63759f5202f\n It is made in a single file, using as much of default Emacs as possible, so you can fork it, customize or get inspired. It is not, by any means an \"Emacs Distro\".\n I'd love some nice feedbacks (preferably on Github issues so we can track and reuse issues).\n Github: https://github.com/LionyxML/lemacs\n Install instructions on Readme.org\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/LionyxML  \n [link]   [comments]",

LaTeX is installed on my machine and the export works fine from terminal emacs (emacs -nw) so from what I've read this is likely a PATH issue.

I understand they are different, but I'm not getting why the one is able to be displayed and the other is not.\n I've read every article I could find on this sub and google about Emojis in Emacs on Windows, but most articles are either 2+ year old, or have some broken links and succeeded to fix this issue.\n I'm running native Emacs on Windows, I'm not using WSL. I'm using Emacs 28.2.\n I have installed all-the-icons. I also have installed \"Noto Color Emoji\" and put this in my ~/.emacs:\n (set-fontset-font t 'symbol \"Noto Color Emoji\")\n And evaluated. I've also tried with \"native\" windows emoji font: Segoe UI Emoji, but same story.\n I'm getting the emoji in the buffer, but it's invisible. If I copy it from, say, emojipedia and CTRL + y in a buffer, the cursor moves as if something was inserted, but nothing is shown as if I inserted a SPC.\n However if I CTRL+a CTRL+k and then paste it in, say, my browser, I get all the emojis I've inserted in the buffer.\n My question is - Has the Windows API changed(that is the reason, allegedly, why it didn't work in the past as I've read about this issue on this sub) or is there some other way to display emojis in Emacs buffer on Windows 10 that bypasses this API problem or whichever other problem there is.\n On my Linux machine everything works fine, however, unfortunately, sometimes I'm forced to use Windows and thus want to make it work here as well.\n    submitted by    /u/aqua_cap  \n [link]   [comments]",

To support this, I’ve developed a customized terminal experience on kitty. Basically, if I open a new tab, it will clone my current environment, including the container/remote, current directory, and current bashrc. And it also color-codes tabs based on the type of environment I’m in. \n I’m curious if it would be possible/interesting/desirable to recreate this setup in emacs, with the ultimate goal of using emacs as a customized ide + terminal emulator. \n Does anyone have thoughts on this? The first issue that I see is that so far, I haven’t found a tab bar for emacs that supports customizing the colors of the tabs. I’m sure this is possible, but I’m too new to emacs to know how difficult it would be (I have experience coding in multiple lisp dialects, so needing to code in order to customize is not a drawback).

However, due to Lisp paranthesized syntax it is possible to simplify it. I have now re-written it so it just needs one marker to mark which expression is to be evaluated as Lisp:\n 1 + 2 = %%3 1 + 2 = %%(+ 1 2) 1 + 2 = %%!escaped \n Due to Emacs being a text processing toolkit and a Lisp repl/environment, that basically let us use Emacs Lisp as a template language in text files. The intended use is file and code generators.\n The simplified syntax turnes out to be slightly harder to process than the one with start and end delimiters, however I think it might be worth, so here is an experiment to test the idea.\n Download and details about the usage details are in online repo.\n I appreciate critique and discussion, especially if you find a bug or some fundamental problem.\n    submitted by    /u/arthurno1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Wanted to get back into reading forever, you can bet that's happening. And lots of things I've wanted to sink my teeth into, but never did for one reason or another. Two of them are emacs, and recreational math.\n My hope is that the reason I've never been able to sit down and work my way through the Petersen book was that I was just too sapped from work and life stuff. And apparently I got six months or so, so I'll have plenty of time to digest it. But. In case it turns out that I'm just lazy and weak, plan is to go through his beginners guide, and follow his advice of having a goal with emacs. I have two:\n  \nI want to learn how to do Bullet Journal-type of stuff. Make plans, write pieces for myself, that sort of thing. Heard that org-mode isn't any good for longer entries, though, so advice here would be appreciated.\n Something I can practice my math in. From taking notes, to copying out math problems and solving them, so on. I have no clue what this would look like, so again, advice appreciated.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SameUsernameOnReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

(You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)\nI am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you'd normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).\nI thought that I'd create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).\nSo, what should be considered?\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",

But I don't know if this is good practice. The other options I could use are:\nuse two tags: \"#good #technician\".\nuse only the core of the idea: \"#technician\".\nWhat do you recommend me to do?\nBecause in this note, I just want to refer to good technicians (I don't want to talk about technicians in general).

I'm not seeing any English translations at present. I suspect it has material on using card indexes as databases and may be focused on business use, but may also have some connections to note taking practices of the time. I've also found several references to Porstmann's work and that of George Christoph Lichtenberg which makes me even more curious about the potential note taking connections.\nPorstmann, Walter.

My issue here is that I often don't know what information is going to come out of the article until I've read it.  Should I just take my best guess? (am I just overthinking it)?\nShould I keep it on a separate task list or someday/maybe list?

I'm so glad to have discovered this forum.\nA question has been nagging me ever since I started my ZK journey, and that is: what do I do if I'm into multiple topics?\nMy interests are all over the place: I'm into photography, sociology, history, theology, philosophy, linguistics, and education.\nI am not sure whether I should have one giant slip box for everything or multiple ones for topics that have stuff in common. But that would also raise a conundrum. I'm into photography, and I'm into art history, so those two topics could be in one slip box. But then I'm also into history in general, so should art history be a part of the box with history or photography? Again, this is just an example, not an actual dilemma.\nI'm going through Ahrens' book but I don't know if it will touch on this particular topic. He does mention that Luhmann wrote on all sorts of subjects, which seems to indiciate he had a single slip box system for everything.\nHas anyone here dealt with this?",

Chris Rock writes headlines for his jokes on slips of paper and then arranges them on either tables or small bulletin boards to outline his set list for presenting jokes for his performances.\n\n\nIf there are interesting contemporaneous news items which appear, he'll include a newspaper or other material to represent the related joke for inclusion into his set. This makes a fascinating means of outlining his material and seems to fall within the realm of my search for zettelkasten output processes. Even if Rock doesn't use index cards to write or store his jokes like comedians in the past have, he's using a slip-based method for outlining and arranging them as part of his output process.\n\nKevin Hart: Chris, I'm so... I'm so, uh blown away by what I'm discovering that is your process.\nChris Rock: My process.\nKevin Hart: This all your shit?\n\n\nChris Rock: Well, this here would be, uh, bullet points for tonight. Every card represents a joke or a reference that I choose. I don't wanna forget. You know what I mean? Like, you can remember all your jokes, but some nights, I'm like, 'ehhh, I'm not gonna close with this one. I'm gonna close with that one'.\nKevin Hart: You have it down to a science where you can bullet point the time.\nChris Rock: You can. And by the way, sometimes, something happens in the news.\nKevin Hart: You got jokes on the bench.\nChris Rock: I have jokes on the bench.\n\nKevin Hart: I'm going to tell you I'm not only impressed by that, but I'm disappointed in myself. Because, uh, whatever I got, got to to fly.\n(Original post can be found at: https://boffosocko.com/2023/12/27/chris-rocks-zettelkasten-output-process/)",

MOCs and hub notes feel like a dream for my personal organization. higher-order learning seemed extremely necessary. disregarding the idea of separate disciplines in lieu of an understanding rooted in existing knowledge seemed very helpful.\nnow it's been a couple months and my zettelkasten contains over 100 zettels; i'd say about 20 regarding personal knowledge management and then about 80 medical notes. that is the problem, though. i look at other notemakers' obsidian graphs and they're one big ideaverse of notes radiating from the center. my notes, conversely, are separated into blobs by discipline or level of abstraction from reality. (e.g. anatomy [tangible] vs. study concepts [intangible]) in essence, i want to keep watching my zettelkasten grow--it is helping me retain information--but i'm a bit scared that i'm not implementing higher-order learning correctly.\nthis is making me unsure whether a traditional, luhmann-esque zettelkasten is the best idea for medical study. what do you think? does anyone else have trouble connecting tangible, business-related zettels to more abstract zettels?",

Also, it doesn't rely on org-mode so you don't need to also be familiar with how org mode works and just stay within emacs for your note taking needs.
