          "description": "I am considering to give haskell a go (again). I actually wanted to earlier but got discouraged by an (at that time) very clunky tooling experience, and I also found it annoying that I had to use pragma's to for example enable exhaustive type checking (which imo always should be default). At the time I instead decided to dive into Purescript, which I have been enjoying quite a lot ever since. I have probably written somewhere around 10k lines of purescript by now. However, I feel that purescript is quite niche and has some annoying limits due to primarily running on node or in the browser. For example, I don't see myself ever doing proper parallel processing in purescript. I also feel that purescript might be more limited in context of future job opportunities. These are the reasons for which I am considering to give learning Haskell a second try.\n Much learning material seems to be targeted at OOP programmers who are new to FP. I obviously don't need the the whole FP sales pitch with my background. What I need is more something along the lines of \"I am comfortable with FP, monads, type classes and monad transformers, and now I want to learn Haskell without getting bored by the learning material\".\n I have read the excellent purescript book called \"Functional programming made easier\" https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier. My background before Purescript has been working professionally with F# and Clojure for a few years.\n On the longer run I am considering to do some Haskell certification https://certification.serokell.io/\n    submitted by    /u/Combination-Western  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the one hand I would like to keep it as simple as possible — e.g. a MimeRender instance that produces a lazy ByteString. But this doesn't seem possible as the rendering involves IO. On the other hand I want to make sure that HTML is sent out as soon as it's produced, ie. no buffering on the server side — which makes me want to get a hold of some sendData :: Socket -> IO () function, so that I'm sure data is sent out when I want it. The former seems more elegant, but I don't see how it's possible (due to performing IO to produce the ByteString) and it's not clear to me how the server will buffer lazy ByteString chunks. The latter seems to do the job, but seems very low level.\n Any clues on how I should approach this?\n    submitted by    /u/runeks  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question is about the AI part of the game, where minimax is used. I was a little bit confused about the prune function:\n prune :: Int -> Tree a -> Tree a\n prune 0 (Node x _) = Node x []\n prune n (Node x ts) = Node x [prune (n-1) t | t <- ts]\n Why do we need such a prune function in Haskell (which has lazy evaluation). Why can't we just create a single infinite game tree, and run the fitness function on it to a certain depth, without creating a new finite tree via pruning? We can then reuse the same tree, by cutting it from the top after each move, and sort of expanding the (same) tree downwards. Shouldn't this also work? \n I then saw that one of the exercises of that chapter was:\n generate the game tree once, rather than for each move \n A solution for that exercise is provided here by someone on Github. However, it seems to me that here a new tree is generated after each move, and thus the tree is not shared during the whole game.\n    submitted by    /u/Most_Appearance_3751  \n [link]   [comments]",

Encoding is performed by recursively merging pairs with the smallest merge index until there remain no pairs to be merged, and encoded representations can be decoded backed into the original through vocabulary look-ups.

Second, I don't know why the function fails to change the x value to 9 on the last line. That might simply be my ignorance of how RecordWildCards works.\n In general, are sum types of records a terrible idea? Will things break if some of the records have fields with the same name? I suppose name clashes could be addressed by defining the records separately in their own namespaces, and then putting them all together in the sum type. Finally, if there's a particular reference that would be valuable for better understanding how records work in Haskell, I'd appreciate a pointer. But perhaps the manual is sufficient: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/records.html\n Thank you.\n EDIT: On a bit of investigation, it appears that you can use the same field in multiple records in a sum type. The bigger issue appears to be when a field is only in one record. You can write code that isn't type safe because it's calling a record selector that works on one record type on a different record type.

I have mainly been looking at smaller exercises provided by Advent of Code. I believe these open ended problems provide a good basis for practice as I have a lot of freedom but in this freedom is also what I believe to be the largest pitfall as I can easily resort to thought patterns not meant for the functional paradigm. After working through some exercises I went back to Day 3 ( https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3 ) because when I first looked at it I had no clear idea of what Haskell could provide me in order to solve the problem in a streamlined manner, so I skipped …",

I did so and thought that I had finally reached an understanding with the whole thing... until I was told my understanding was wrong.\n Starting from the beginning: I went to study Functors, most places talking about them just talk about how fmap works, and I understood them as \"Anything that has a definition of fmap\". \n The other places talk about it's category theory definition: This, together with me reading that \"All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors\", made me \"click\" this exact thought \"Wait, if the definition of an Endofunctor is when a category maps to itself, and fmap returns the same typeclass as the one it receives as input, therefore the typeclasses are the categories here and that's why they're called Endofunctors! I got it!\".\n So I went to ask people about how a \"non-Endo\" Functor would be... and that's when I was told that the explanation I came with was wrong: Typeclasses are not \"categories\" in this context, people say \"All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors\" because the \"category\" here (Called Hask) is the set of all types in Haskell (And indeed, all mappings to a type in Haskell yield... a type in Haskell), but that simply destroyed the prior understanding I had and made the word \"Functor\" meaningless to em again.\n Given that the concept of fmap and Functor are so closely related, is the fact that fmap always returns the same structure as the one of the input it is given (e.g. a fmap with a List will always yield a List, a fmap with an IO monad will always yield an IO monad, a fmap with a Either Monad WON'T EVER yield a Maybe Monad) just a coincidence, having nothing to do with the definition of either a Functor or an Endofunctor?\n    submitted by    /u/Sky_Sumisu  \n [link]   [comments]",

Turns out such project is much harder than I anticipated, and we don't have the scale to do it yet. There are still no brackets/croissants, as the performance impact of these is too harsh to keep it practical. I'll keep working hard to make it happen one day.\n I'm posting this because it might interest one of you. The new atomic linking algorithm on HVM2's paper is beautiful and I think some of you will enjoy. Please do delete the thread if you think it is off-topic here. HVM2 is written in Rust.

I am currently bedridden and very ill but at least now I can have something to do!\n It seems like this is a recurring question but it is just really confusing and I need some guidance. \n I just want to hone my haskell programming skills meaning that whenever I find exercises or puzzles I will look for modules that implement functions I can use without having to write em myself. These packages aren't in base. For example on hackage I found digits. \n In python i would just create a venv, pip install away and trash the entire environment when done, leaving me with a clean global installation. \n Reading about cabal and messing with it ever so slightly I am already afraid that everything is about to go to hell. I read about hsenv and how supposedly it is kinda the same (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsenv) so I guess I can use that and just cabal install --lib away there but havent tried it yet.\n How do you guys do this? How do you mess around and experiment with non-base modules after which you remove what is unnecessary leaving you with a clean system? I just want to write some basic scripts, maybe at some point write some larger applications. Every single time I get drawn back in again (it is all for my own benefit, i am not required to learn haskell) I am met with this exact same nonsense where I just blank out and ditch it because my global installation gets f*cked. I am sick of it! I love the language! Have so for years! Help me love this tooling by telling me how you handle it!\n Edit: for the record i have everything installed using ghcup, i am also fairly familiar writing haskell code.

After trying to build the package for some time, I got an error:\n src/Data/Sexp.hs:4:14: warning: [-Wdeprecated-flags] -XOverlappingInstances is deprecated: instead use per-instance pragmas OVERLAPPING/OVERLAPPABLE/OVERLAPS | 4 | {-# LANGUAGE OverlappingInstances, ViewPatterns #-} | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [1 of 4] Compiling Data.Sexp ( src/Data/Sexp.hs, dist/build/Data/Sexp.o, dist/build/Data/Sexp.dyn_o ) src/Data/Sexp.hs:200:25: error: [GHC-76037] Not in scope: type constructor or class ‘NoSelector’ Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘Selector’ (imported from GHC.Generics) | 200 | instance IsRecord (M1 S NoSelector f) False | ^^^^^^^^^^ Error: cabal: Failed to build sexp-0.7 (which is required by exe:sexp from sexp-0.7).

Can you just find a package on hackage and install it, or do you have to check for compatibility first? In this case, the package hasn't been updated in 7 years, but I was unable to learn that from hackage--I had to go look at its github page. I'm guessing the age is a problem, but I just don't have a sense of how to find packages and determine whether they'll be compatible with my setup.\n For reference, I'm running ghc version 9.6.5 in a nix develop shell.

(Eg, turning every \"Implies a b\" into \"Or (Not a) b\" while leaving everything else untouched).\n Not every constructor has the same shape, so there isn't an easy way to use wildcards while keeping the function recursive, and so to avoid writing a bunch of nearly identical recursive calls (elimImp (Not a) = Not (elimImp a)) for every function, I wrote an operator Ive been calling $$ that threads a function through every recursive constructor, and then elimImp can just be a case statement that only does its job, and then is the identity otherwise, and doesnt have to worry about keeping the recursion going. \n This thingy, $$, isn't exactly map, and isn't exactly apply, even though it's clearly similar to both. I am assuming it's a fairly common operation to perform on recursive data structures, but I don't know what I would be called. What exactly have I written?

This will cause Stack to rebuild dependencies for such plans.\n  \nChanges since v2.15.5:\n Major changes:\n  \nStack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.\n  \nBehavior changes:\n  \nStack’s StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal’s replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.\n  \nBug fixes:\n  \nFix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a ‘no operation’ stack build to be slower than previously.\n The hashes that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another now include the Cabal flags for immutable dependencies set manually.

With Scala 3 there are new options on the horizon for control flow based error handling. Interestingly things like boundary break syntax for error handling in ox looks very much like monadless syntax, but works totally different under the hood.\n disclaimer: when I say control flow driven error handling, I don't mean the anti-pattern of intentionally using exceptions for control flow\n    submitted by    /u/kag0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I resented it at first (too much magic), but it kind of grew on me and I recently started to really appreciate it mainly in the following sense: When modeling my domain I can go full java-first, completely ignoring that my model is backed by a RDBMS, that is - code my model as if there were no DB, slap the right annotations on it, (make a few compromises here and there) and get going. It even forward engineers the ddl for me.\n So in scala world it seems to me that the accepted approach is to separate the model from the persistent model? \n Here is why I think that: - the libraries I found map rows to case classes, but usually no built in support for inheritance, sealed trait hierachies, ... - no support for one to many aggregation - bad support for nested case class, especially if they occur multiple times\n Here is a sample of how I would model an invoice if there were no database\n scala case class Invoice( ... senderName: String, senderAddress: Address, // general purpose case class to not repeat myself recipientName: String, recipientAddress: Address, status: Status, // some sealed trait with cases like e.g. case Sent(when: LocalDate) positions: List[InvoicePosition] ... ) \n I feel like I either - have to compromise A LOT in modeling my domain if I want to close to zero hassle with db libs out there - have my db access case classes be separated from the domain and do alot of mapping/transforming\n Any experiences, or hints? how do you handle this in your apps\n    submitted by    /u/TenYearsOfLurking  \n [link]   [comments]",

Handling the flatMap function won't a responsibility of T1 as first Future is not completed, but it will be blocked by the Await.result function until it is resolved. Or T1 is going back to the pool?\n Meanwhile T2 thread will wake up from 1sec sleep and will return 10 as the result and start executing the asyncCalculation2 function and it will create another thread (T3) while doing that. After that, what will happen to T2? Will it go back to the global thread pool this time? Or is it set to a blocked/waiting status as T1?\n And finally T3 is the one responsible for executing the callback inside the map function. And now since T3 is the last thread to complete, for whom the Await.result function is waiting for?? Is it T2 or T3 ??\n    submitted by    /u/lsampath  \n [link]   [comments]",

This extension is an O/R mapper built on top of the ScalikeJDBC core library, drawing significant inspiration from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord library. For instance, you can run the following query just with simple CRUDMapper class/object definition:\n ...\n Thank you to all the contributors for this release! 👍\n * u/jchyb helped u/seratch resolve Scala 3 compilation errors for scalikejdbc-orm module (#1249)\n * u/kardapoltsev resolved missing tags in one-to-x queries (#2163)\n * u/xuwei-k did a substantial amount of work for refactoring and dependency management\n  \nWhat is ScalikeJDBC ?\n  \nThis library seamlessly wraps JDBC APIs, offering intuitive and highly flexible functionalities. With QueryDSL, your code becomes inherently type-safe and reusable.\n ScalikeJDBC is not just practical; it’s production-ready. Utilize this library confidently in your real-world projects.\n  \nCongratulations to the ScalalikeJDBC author and all other contributors for the new release ! 👏\n    submitted by    /u/Previous_Pop6815  \n [link]   [comments]",

Drawer Lorem Ipsum  will be rendered as a collapsible drawer in the resulting html. This led me to write some custom pandoc filters, for example to convert a :NOTES: org drawer to a ??? NOTES md block.\n In all fairness, it's becoming a bit complex and there's a lot of stuff I'm not covering yet.\n So the reason for this post is to ask you for guidance about what approach to use, I see 3 options: 1. continue with the current approach of using pandoc, adding more logic/filters when needed 2. use a different, more complete, org parser and then generate mkdocs-compatible markdown myself 3. write something entirely in Elisp, similarly to projects like ox-hugo.\n I'm a bit of an Elisp newbie, so I'm not sure how feasible it is for me to tackle option 3, other than that feel free to suggest other options.\n Thank you for taking the time to read this!\n    submitted by    /u/zuegg  \n [link]   [comments]",

From all of those Obsidian was the best since it was so easy to implement a working note taking system(and a second brain). The only problem with Obsidian is that it's not open-source and I can't use it on my work machine, so I decided to look for other options.\n In my work life I live in neovim like 90% of the time and I don't want to change that. (I tried Emacs for work, but that was a bad experience, since the lsp was slow and I spent several seconds between jump-to-definition etc.)\n I heard a lot about org-mode before, so I decided to give it a try and man.. I love it already. I see the unlimited possibilities(thatswhy it's so unfortuante that I can't use emacs as a primary IDE). \n Now I'm trying to setup a meeting and personal tasking process for myself. In Obsidian I used the following people and meeting notes suggestion and it was very nice. people notes template, meeting notes template\n I'm looking for something similar. What I really like:\n  \nI have autocompletion for attendees\n I can query for meeting for an attendee in their person notes\n I can capture a new person very easily\n I can capture a new meeting either quickly or retroactively\n  \nI'm still learning the capabilities of org, org-roam, so I just wanted to ask you how to implement a similar approach? \n Do you have any other recommendation for me?\n I also like that I can leave next actions as todos, so I can see them in org-agenda.\n    submitted by    /u/realdiwin  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I decided to just roll my own solution!\n There are quite a few quirks with the package right now, the main one being that it currently cleans the buffer and then repopulates it with the newly synced entries.. I am working for a smarter fix for this where it actually respects the buffer contents and just adds new highlights or modifies changed highlights to the correct entries, but I need to make this perfomant enough to not be a pain in the bottom to use..\n Well, here is the code! https://github.com/CountGreven/org-readwise I hope this helps some of you!\n    submitted by    /u/Fit_Advice8313  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't want to abandon Org completely though and see a lot of value in it for organizing my stuff more thoroughly and it helps me think through stuff and complete longer term projects in a way I don't see iOS tools doing. \n    submitted by    /u/ActualIllustrator836  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What's the best way to sync installed package versions between different computers?\n I have been using use-package with :ensure t for a long time (with the default package.el as the backend). But I've read posts from experienced Emacs users suggesting to not do this. Instead, they recommend using package-install manually and then check ~/.emacs.d/elpa into their dotfiles repo, so that you sync the exact set of installed packages between computers. This is supposed to make the config more reproducible, since after a git pull every computer will have the same \"Emacs state\".\n This idea appeals to me, especially since I've noticed that (i) sometimes my config doesn't bootstrap correctly on new computers, (ii) sometimes package upgrades break my setup and I want an easy way to roll everything back when I need to just get work done, and (iii) I've started relying more on GitHub packages (via package-vc-install-from-checkout) and would like to avoid having to repeat this on new hosts.\n Some more concrete questions for those who follow this approach:\n  \nIf you sync your installed packages in this way, what exactly do you sync (i.e. what's your `.gitignore`)? \n I guess you *should* sync the `*.el` files, otherwise there's not much point.\n I guess you *shouldn't* sync the natively compiled {`*.eln`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`} files.\n But what about the byte compiled `*.elc` files? Are these portable across different operating systems, different processor architectures, different Emacs ports, and different Emacs major versions?\n \n After syncing, do you need to do anything special to make things work? \n For example, is `package-recompile-all` required?\n \n  \nOr is all this a fools errand, and I should instead switch tox e.g. elpaca, straight, etc.? Since I left Spacemacs and Doom Emacs some years ago, I've mostly stuck to the default package.el when I use Emacs (I regularly use Vim as well). But I am open to other tools if they make my life significantly easier.\n    submitted by    /u/setopt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used org-excalidraw for a bit, it was great, but the export tool it used excalidraw_export does not function properly at all in my KUbuntu 24.04 environment.

          "description": "Good afternoon, Emacsen\n I don't honestly use tree-sitter much -- my main language is well handled by the venerable vhdl-mode. However I had been using it many moons ago for a Typst document. I had all the libraries obtained, and snagged typst-ts-mode for the part where it does things with the tree-sitter output.\n I distinctly remember there being syntax coloring when I was using it before.\n I recently opened the same Typst document, and it's not doing anything with syntax highlighting. I dutifully updated Typst, the tree-sitter libraries, and typst-ts-mode and still no joy. I can turn on treesit-explore-mode and see tree-sitter correctly interpreting the code. So far, so good I guess. That's the main engine. (Also (treesit-language-available-p 'typst) returns true, so I think I'm pretty solidly in the tree-sitter active camp.)\n However I have been reading Mickey Peterson's article on tree-sitter (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter), trying to make sure there wasn't some step I left out along the way. Also the tree-sitter Emacs documentation at https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/. This last claims that there exists a function tree-sitter-hl-mode. I tried M-x tree-sitter- and about this time, completion offers up nothing. There are no tree-sitter functions! This is Emacs 29 and it was built with tree-sitter support so I would imagine that the basic functions would be there.\n Any ideas what went pear-shaped here? I started a ticket at typst-ts-mode's repo but I am not entirely sure if the issue is that I forgot to set something up, or if it is indeed that package.\n Thanks! I think I will remove the call to use typst-ts-mode and see if there's any difference in behavior. I THINK there's a slight snag when that buffer loads, but I'm not 100% certain just yet.

It never stops and it adapts to anything you want to do with a computer. \n Using one, or several terminal emulator buffers inside Emacs can be extremely useful. What's you use case?\n As for me, one thing I do often is create a keyboard macro that gathers information from one or several shell or REPL output to place it inside text file either for documentation or to create unit-test code. And sometimes I write some elisp code to do some of that. Being able to interact with an Erlang and Python REPL for example, with the OS shell of a local or remote computer and Emacs Lisp together (including with eshell) greatly enhance what can be done quickly. \n Not all Emacs terminal emulators are made equal.

For instance, I use WSL, so there are a lot of nested folders I have to navigate through, which means I end up hitting TAB a lot, and it's painful.\n My current workflow looks something like this: C-x C-f ~/fol TAB (folder1) TAB nes er2 TAB (nested-folder2), and so on.\n For completion, I used Helm in the past. I use Vertico now because I believe I'll be able to master it sooner than Helm. I feel it's more predictable with more information available online on how to set it up. However, I liked how Helm handles completion with the RET flow instead of TAB unlike Vertico which opens Dired on RET. \n Now, I have a few questions:\n  \nIs there a better way to navigate mini-buffer completions? \n Is there a better way to navigate through nested folders efficiently?\n \n How can I mimic Helm-like completion behavior in Vertico?\n How do I turn off TAB completion so that I don't keep clicking out of habit, like I do with Capslock?\n  \nThanks!\n edit: typo\n    submitted by    /u/stevejb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm experimenting with composition-function-tableto add effects to certain sequences of characters, like shoving to characters closer together. I noticed that characters with descenders that extend below the baseline like \"g\", \"j\", and \"y\" can cause the line height to increase when rendered via `font-shape-string` via a custom entry in `composition-function-table`. This happens for example with the \"M+ Code Latin 50\" font, but only at certain font heights.\n The simplest reproduction is this:\n (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t '([\"g\" 0 font-shape-gstring])) \n That causes this artifact, where typing a \"g\" causes the next line to shift downwards:\n https://cdn.zappy.app/801ae7a7b03d568b3b80500b04047054.gif\n It works fine (no line shifting) stock, but when I add an entry to `composition-function-table` the weirdness starts happening.\n I tried messing with the font in FontLab. I can fix the problem by increasing the Units per eM value, which causes the font to get smaller. I then increase the font height in Emacs to compensate. That works, but it's an odd thing to do, and I have to make the font height pretty large to get a normal-looking actual height. Other options in FontLab like increasing the line gap, safe descender value, etc didn't help.\n I'd like to understand why this is happening.\n EDIT: \";\" (semicolon) is a more realistic example. I'm trying to create a ligature that will push \";;\" closer together, for Lisp comments. However the semicolon in my font has a descender that extends below the baseline, causing the same line shifting effect as shown with the \"g\" above, when I try to use a \";;\" ligature.\n    submitted by    /u/stevemolitor  \n [link]   [comments]",

The motivation is to replicate a dev-container like environment in emacs. As much as possible, at any rate (as per this post).\n I can access the docker container's filesystem through the path /docker:container_name:/path/to/file. I'm using the clang-format package in emacs, which allows me to run clang-format on buffers. I'd like it to use the clang-format binary installed in the container. By default, it will look on my local filesystem, so have fiddled with the clang-format.el. It used to read:\n (defcustom clang-format-executable (or (executable-find \"clang-format\") \"clang-format\") \"Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable.\" :group 'clang-format :type '(file :must-match t) :risky t) \n and have bodged it to the following:\n (defcustom clang-format-executable \"/docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format\" \"Location of the clang-format executable.

Presumably this is actually possible; eglot can invoke `clangd` in the container as its LSP; that all works really nicely straight out of the box, but I have absolutely no idea where to even start looking in eglot to figure out how it works...\n    submitted by    /u/Flashy_Loquat_9282  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this case, the candidate with , inside will be treated as two typed candidates:\n  \nExample:\n (completing-read-multiple \"PROMPT: \" '(\"first\" \"sec,ond\" \"third\")) ;; <selecting \"sec,ond\"> ;; => (\"sec\" \"ond\") \n A developer have to locally rebind crm-separator and tell the user which character to type to separate the candidates.\n (let ((crm-separator \"[ \\t]*|[ \\t]*\")) (completing-read-multiple \"Type `|' to select another candidate: \" '(\"first\" \"sec,ond\" \"third\"))) \n  \nCandidates might contain any character, so it's hard to pick easily typed separator. Example: Org headings, file names. In this case a developer might use \\n as a separator, which a user can enter by pressing C-o and moving the cursor 1 char forward to be able to display the list of candidates (which is not convenient).\n  \nExample:\n (let ((crm-separator \"[ \\t]*\\n[ \\t]*\")) (completing-read-multiple \"Prompt: \" '(\"first.\" \"sec,ond\" \"third;\"))) \n completing-read-strings solves the issue by providing a function that have the same interface for all kind of candidates. Internally, collects the chosen candidates into a list during reading and then returns it (without the need to split the input string with regular expression).\n    submitted by    /u/ichernyshovvv  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I call `lsp-execute-code-action`, expecting auto-import action to be executed, emacs creates empty file and moves me to there instead.\n When there is no code action, LSP inserts a dumb action for creating a new file and moving there. So if LSP is too slow to find out the actual code action needed, it creates a new file instead.\n This issue is ruining my workflow and wanted to ask if anyone else encountered.

I confirmed the issue was seemingly solved by running a minimal org-mode config in an emacs -Q session and observing that the slowdown only happened if org-refile-use-cache was set to t.\n So I decided to just stop setting org-refile-use-cache to t and everything …",

If the daily note already exists, add a new heading.\" (interactive) (let ((date (or (thing-at-point 'date) (format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d\" (org-read-date nil t))))) (if date (let ((parsed-date (org-read-date nil t date))) (org-roam-dailies-goto-date parsed-date) (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (goto-char (point-max)) (unless (bolp) (insert \"\\n\")) (insert \"* \"))) (message \"No date found at point.\"))))\n (define-prefix-command 'org-roam-map) (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c n\") 'org-roam-map)\n (with-eval-after-load 'org-roam (define-key org-roam-map (kbd \"d\") 'my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point)) ```\n 2 problems I see: 1. I want to use a keybinding when the point is on a date to create the link ==> I am not sure the latest part for the creation is OK and that the proper keymap is chosen\n  \nSo far, instead of reading the date at point to create the daily note or insert the link into an existing one, it uses the function org-roam-dailies-goto-date which asks again for a date from the calendar. \n  \nhow would you improve this function? thanks for your ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/fmou67  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I use xwidget-webkit-browse-url it shows a blank white screen. When I use emacs directly (instead of through an emacsclient from the instance started by systemd), it works properly.\n I get the following error when I do a systemctl --user status emacs:\n  May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev emacs[3306]: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window May 18 21:30:31 work-dev WebKitWebProces[19150]: cannot open display: \n I assumed that maybe it was an issue where $DISPLAY wasn't set properly so I did M-x setenv and set DISPLAY to :1 (same as what I found from a terminal emulator) and no luck.

It isn't advanced enough to require parameters yet. It also executes successfully if I type ./my_lsp in a terminal. It produceses a log file to confirm this. Is that not the path it means?

          "description": "I wanted to make a package, mostly for myself, where I could have a bunch of org files that I would use as templates for projects.\n Let's say you want to create a C project. The org file would contain code blocks with a basic hello world file in the src folder, and a basic Makefile or something. The package could also be asked to create a git repo or whatever else you want. You would then call a function, select one of the project templates, be prompted for any optional argument the template may have (like libraries maybe) and create the project structure by tangling the source blocks.\n I managed to make this work, but I hit quite a bothersome snag in the road.\n Makefiles NEED tabs to work. And org discards tabs when tangling, replacing them with 4 spaces.\n I have no way to make this work seamlessly. I can set org-src-preserve-indentation but that makes it so the two space margin added to source block for styling is also included in the final file, so I need to make them all not have this margin, which sucks.\n It also means I need a way to set this variable not only when tangling, but also when editing so org doesn't discard the tab there as well. I made it a file local variable, but it's considered risky so you are prompted to apply it, which is annoying as hell.\n This thing just killed my idea, because I don't like the compromises just for ONE single file type.\n BTW I do know of skeletor's existence, but I think it tries to do too much and ends up being quite bothersome, constantly needing external tools, and not even using built in features like completing-read, and instead rolling its own.\n    submitted by    /u/Guiding2011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Emacs veterans,\n I encountered a situation like the following. I am working on a project and a tool is used when building the project. The tool requires me to add a line in my `.bashrc` which `source` a script file that does something and source another three files. This means without sourcing the file, that tool is not usable from command line and I can't build the project. Recently, I am learning to use \"compile\" command of Emacs to work on this project. I found because that tool needs that sourcing of the script, I can't simply make use of the tool with \"compile\" command.\n One possibility is to dig through all the scripts involved, figured out what they do, and somehow set them up manually in some fixed way, but this would be a tedious work, also, it'd be not reliable after I upgrade the tool in the future.\n Currently, my solution is that I use `bash -i -c 'the_tool params..'` instead of `the_tool params...`. Although this works for me for the case at the moment, it's not very handy, and I wonder what the better solutions out there that experienced Emacs users will do.\n It seems I can also make Emacs source my `.bashrc` when Emacs starts, but I am not sure if I want to source `.bashrc` every time my Emacs loads, because this tool is only needed for doing a particular type of project development.\n I wonder what would you guys do for this situation. Thanks in advance for you input.\n P. S. I didn't say the name of the tool with an intention that I want to know ways to deal with this as a general situation, instead of learning for example, that a package exists that is for this tool for this situation.\n    submitted by    /u/qiattsik  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to figure out how to use org-mode and org-brain together as data management. The extension of the org-mode headings hierarchy into a graph (parent-child-friend) with org-brain is great for me. But now I'm needing something very data-intensive, in my case I need to create an inventory which will easily have thousands of items. I am working for an apartment complex and I need a way to inventory all the fixed and non-fixed assets. I don't want to just go with a relational database or even a spreadsheet. Yes, org-mode/brain is text- and file-based, so each inventory item will be a separate file or heading in a file, but I don't want even more separate files and/or headings for each inventory item's details. One idea I had was to create a lisp defvar symbol for each inventory item (e.g., screens, garden hose, picnic table, etc.) and have a list (a-/p-) assigned to the variable with additional info, e.g., '((size xxx) (count 10)...). But then I've got a huge amount of global variables going on in an Emacs session. This seems impractical, but, hey, I've seen crazy data management stuff done in Emacs lisp.\n Another idea is to do the items as org-mode/brain files or headings, then put item details in an org-mode table -- and rely on the whole org table ecosystem. Another idea is have item details in a custom drawer in a file or under a heading. Another is have very broad inventory categories as variables, then attach huge lists of lists of lists to each variable. (e.g., custom-set-variables in my init file with hundreds of lists.) In general, the Lisp world is wont to leverage the abstract syntax tree, and org-element is there to help with that.

During the last few sessions that I have been using my Zettelkasten, I have rediscovered old forgotten thoughts that have enhanced the thinking I was doing in the present.\nOne of the keys to this is that I use my Zettelkasten almost every time I have to think about some of my projects.\nFor example, suppose I'm having trouble developing a character's personality in a fiction story. What I do is create a structural note that aims to answer the question, \"What is the ideal workflow for developing the personality of a fictional character?\" In this way, the structural note is not about the specific project of that story: the thinking is decontextualized (from its original project), which makes it easier to use tha…",

Is there a semantic difference between the shapes under \"human\" and \"zettelkasten?\"\nIs the entity under \"human\" an emergent outcome of the process it is connected to? For example, \"overview of literature\" is emerges in human understanding (ideally) when \"researching\" the \"Sources of the world\" and finding \"Promising sources\"?\nZettelkasten Group\nWhat is the difference between the general group Zettelkasten (as opposed to Human) and the container \"Zettelkasten\" that has the two entities and one process \"Atomic thoughts and connections,\" \"Structuring & Integrating,\" and \"Overview, Tools, Complex Insights\"?

I picture us as carpenters working in the middle of the woods crafting excellence, although instead of wood and carpenter tools we use our brains, our zettlekasten and pen.\nI don’t want to say too much because it’s not the point. Let’s just say I lost something that was really important to me. Something I cared, cherished, loved, tried to understand and that always put a smile on my face.\nNow that it’s lost I have to learn what to do with this. I meditate and being mindful of all the feelings that arise inside me has been a really interesting experience. It of course doesn’t stop the grief or the sadness, but I think it makes it healthy. I’m at peace with my feelings, seeing me as the place where the river just has to flow.\nI’m considering reading Albert Camus - The Stranger and No Mud no Lotus - Thich Nhat Hanh.\nI’ve read before this event in my life works from stoicism and Buddhism which I think are really helping me to experience this in the best way possible.\nWell, thanks for reading and I will appreciate the suggestions of books you found helpful during times where your psyche was put to the test.",

When I branch of from 1a into 1a1, it also normally means, that 1a1 (and 1a2,...) provides analysis of greater details of 1a1, which now becomes the main context for all the children. It does not only mean that I got back to the topic of 1a later, while I had made notes about different topics in 1b and 1c in between. Thus, it seems to me there is a playful tension between a formal structure (topic, subtopic, detail and so forth) …",

I was intrigued, and spent some time reading and researching about it, but I just couldn't visualize how it actually worked.\nThen last fall I was helping my wife find a replacement for Evernote for her recipes, and discovered Obsidian. (It was more than she needed, she went with SimpleNote) but I was intrigued by the idea of linked notes. I downloaded it, watched some videos and started putting stuff in it. I had used various programs before, but they ended up just becoming archives of stuff, and not really useful for production of ideas. I'm working to not fall in that trap this time.\nProbably the two most helpful things for me have been Sonke Ahren's book and a few videos by Morgan Eau on YouTube. This is a great place to start \nI am going back to school after retiring, entering a doctorate program. That's a bit intimidating at 53. I've got a couple of masters, but it's been a while. I'm really hoping using Zettelkasten principles in Obsidian will aid me in my endeavor.",
