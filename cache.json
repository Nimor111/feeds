I largely just use what is recommended in my work project.\n So I got a new M1Pro. I'm the second on my team to do so. They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I'm stumped, so I'm turning to you for help.\n The project I'm trying to build is open source (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our HACKING.md page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn't have llvm installed, so I brew install llvm'd, symlinked into $PATH, and tried again. This failed due to:\n install_name_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd=0x80000034) `install_name_tool' failed in phase `Install Name Tool'. (Exit code: 1) \n My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed llvm@12. So I removed llvm and its $PATH symlink, installed llvm@12, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!\n ... But I can't link. I'm now failing on this:\n Building library for byteorder-1.0.4.. [1 of 1] Compiling System.ByteOrder ( System/ByteOrder.hs, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.o, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.dyn_o ) ar: @/dist/build/objs-29886/ar29886-2.rsp: No such file or directory \n We found a post where someone had a similar issue (here), but the fix in that issue doesn't help: using ar from binutils causes link errors like this instead:\n Linking dist/build/hspec-discover/hspec-discover ... ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/kit/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/hspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40/lib/libHShspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40.a, building for macOS-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for macOS-arm64 \n So I'm kinda lost at this point and hoping someone has tips.

          "description": "Just playing around with a tiny project, I've found that using HSpec with cabal repl would be really really nice. You could call main to run all the tests, or call hspec XyzSpec.spec to run just the tests you currently care about.\n Problem is that GHCi can only load one component at a time. That means I can't do :r to reload code changes that aren't in the test component. If I'm changing library code, then restarting the repl from Cabal all the time isn't convenient as it is slow.\n As a hacky solution, if I add the library's src dir to my test's hs-source-dirs then it works really nicely. Things reload very quickly. But once you start needing build dependencies in the library, you also need to add them to the test project. This starts to feel a bit messy, build tools for other languages don't require hacks like this.\n Is there a better way to do this? I know there's stack test --file-watch but this is very slow. I'm looking to to make tiny changes rapidly, and the time it makes you wait while it builds the project over and over is inconvenient when compared to the instant reloading in GHCi.\n    submitted by    /u/adamMatthews  \n [link]   [comments]",

While it's always a relief when I stumble across a combination that gives a massive speedup, it's often not clear to me why certain things make a big difference in some contexts but not in others (especially bang patterns and INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas). This makes me worry that I may just be overfitting my code to the quirks of the GHC version that I'm currently using (currently 8.10.7 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 machine), and that some of the fruits of my labour will be lost in future when I upgrade. So my questions are: \n  \nHas anyone measured and publicly reported the amount of work that it took them to maintain the speed of high-performance Haskell libraries across GHC versions?\n Is there any guidance anywhere on what kinds of performance optimisations are likely to remain beneficial across GHC versions?\n  \nIn case a concrete example would help, I've written a generic foldl' function for linear data structures (lists, pairs of lists, etc.). In a benchmark that I've written for a Wordle solver that I'm working on, I found that I can improve its performance by about 10% by unrolling one recursive call. I then tried unrolling two recursive calls, and the performance was about 8 times worse! So I tried adding INLINE, and the performance was about 16% faster than the original unrolled version. Here's the code for the different versions: GenericFoldl.hs. Is there any good reason for me to think that future GHC versions will continue to make similar decisions about what to inline, so that the performance of unroll2_genericFoldl' won't suddenly plummet after an upgrade?\n    submitted by    /u/Osemwaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In Bird's book on algorithms in Haskell:\n  \n3.3 Arrays\n One of the main differences between functional and procedural algorithms is that the former rely on lists as the basic carrier of information while the latter rely on arrays. In functional algorithms input usually consists of a list of values, whereas in procedural algorithms input values are usually assumed to be presented as the elements of an array. For a procedural programmer array updates are destructive: once an array is updated by changing the value at a particular index, the old array is lost. In functional programming, data structures are persistent because any named structure may be referred to at some other point in the computation and therefore has to continue to exist. Consequently, any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array. Because they cannot be changed but only copied, purely functional arrays are known as immutable arrays. It is possible to get round this problem and allow mutable structures by encapsulating the operations in a suitable monad, but we will not introduce monads in this book.\n Wholesale or monolithic updates, on the other hand, are ﬁne. Changing all or some of the entries at one go involves copying the array only once. Haskell provides a number of such wholesale operations in the library Data . Array. The purpose of this section is simply to describe the main functions in this library.\n  \nWhat does \"wholesale or monolithic update\" mean? Does it mean exactly \"any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array\"?\n Is a data structure with \"wholesale or monolithic update\" a mutable or immutable one?\n Does library Data . Array provide mutable or immutable arrays?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/timlee126  \n [link]   [comments]",

This means effects are low-boilerplate, easy to understand, and that users of similar libraries can easily get along with cleff.\n It supports higher-order effects implementation, and provides a set of easy-to-use combinators for that. The expressiveness of these combinators are on par with polysemy's Tactics language, and also harder to use incorrectly.\n It uses a ReaderT IO monad as the underlying Eff monad implementation, instead of free monads. \n Therefore, the overhead of effects is reduced greatly (and gives pretty impressive microbenchmark results).\n IO-based effect implementations provides good interaction with exceptions and concurrency (no more losing changes to State due to exceptions).\n \n  \nThe library and documentation are already available on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cleff.\n    submitted by    /u/day_li_ly  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems that given the constraint (1 <= n), it should be able to deduce this. Obviously you can give that (1 <= n +1) but then it complains about (1 <= (n + 1) + 1). Is there a way of writing this as an inductive proof or something similar?

You can define a function that takes Void, but you can never call it. To call it, you would have to provide a value of the type Void, and there just aren’t any. As for what this function can return, there are no restrictions whatsoever. It can return any type (although it never will, because it can’t be called).\n  \nThen it proceeds to explain that a singleton set is actually type ()\n This doesn't make sense to me - why isn't a function that is the equivalent of { return 32 } the same as a morphism mapping an empty set to a non-empty set? And why can't you call a function whose argument is the equivalent of an empty set? And finally, how is () the equivalent of a set with a single member?\n UPDATE: While typing this, I think it finally clicked - still looking for confirmation. An Empty set can only map to an Empty set because there are no elements to transform. Which is why () is some universal element because it implies that you can map a set with one thing to any one other thing. Is this right?\n    submitted by    /u/RoboZoomDax  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So for the purposes of my final year project I'm writing a non-deterministic language by Haskell for the purposes of learning Haskell and to understand language design! Non-determinism in the language arises in the presence of control flow for example : n := 0 Do (n < 10)-> if P.x -> S [] Q.x -> R fi Od So if any of the guards (P.x,Q.x) are True then their statements S,R can be carried out. The caveat here however is that both of the guards could be evaluated to True which means both statements have to be executed. The branch taken that finishes first however is the branch which ultimately gives the final result so for example if the two guards where checking if n is an even number and if n was less than say five then both branches would have to be taken. ​ After just completing a class on Parallel Computing, my first thought was to use threads but then I came across numerous articles and blogs about how the List Monad can handle non-determinism. ​ So my two approaches where to either use threads which I do have some experience with or to see if the List Monad could actually work. I'm inclined to use threads given that each branch obtains its own instance of the program therefore it would make sense to use them but I am quite aware that Haskell‍ is more or less magic so I figured there's probably another way to achieve the effect I desire. ​ Could something along the lines Lisp's amb be of any use? I found the Haskell implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/Amb but it appears to generally be used for more trivial programs than anything else. ​ My apologies if this post isn't allowed, was just looking to rubberduck a bit\n    submitted by    /u/sharctic03  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also am compiling with -threaded.\n ```Main.hs module Main where\n import Control.Concurrent (killThread, forkIO, threadDelay) import Control.Concurrent.MVar (newEmptyMVar, putMVar, takeMVar)\n runWithTimeout :: IO (Maybe String) runWithTimeout = do mvar <- newEmptyMVar threadId <- forkIO $ do let res = Just $ show (f 5) putMVar mvar res\n threadKiller <- forkIO $ do threadDelay $ 2 * (10^6) -- 2 seconds killThread threadId putMVar mvar Nothing res <- takeMVar mvar killThread threadKiller return res \n f :: Int -> Int f n = n * f(n - 1)\n main :: IO () main = do res <- runWithTimeout mapM_ putStrLn res ```\n This is what my cabal file has: .cabal executable test main-is: Main.hs ghc-options: -threaded -fno-omit-yields build-depends: base ^>=4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: app default-language: Haskell2010 \n    submitted by    /u/pretty-crab-111  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also it fixes annoying issue in copyright year updater feature and finally makes headroom fully compilable with GHC 9 (9.0.2 or newer).\n In case you never heard of headroom - it's small command line utility that manages license/copyright headers in your source code files. All needed is to create Markdown templates for license/copyright, fill-in some variables and that's it. It can also do some nice stuff like above mentioned feature that updates years in copyrights for you. Also some languages have extended support, where for example in Java/Scala/Kotlin files you can use class package name as template variable, and in Haskell it can even extract and reuse variables from whole Haddock module header. This release also automatically checks for new versions once per week and notifies user to command line (using this GitHub REST API) - no data collection or telemetry bullshit is happening), but if you don't like it, it can be easily disabled in configuration.\n Headroom is already few years out, but I'm always happy to hear ideas about new features or improvements, feel free to open new issue or PR in such case.\n    submitted by    /u/xwinus  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, since base 4.8.0, we have elem and length in Foldable.\n There is also a discussion around moving Foldable1 into base to generalize foldl1, foldr1 and the strict versions thereof.\n I think zip and zipWith would also be great candidates for doing this.\n Many containers already define there own version of these functions, so I think adding this new typeclass in base would generalize the definition of some functions using zip to work for other containers without importing conflicting definitions.\n The definition should probably look something like this:\n class Functor f => Zippable f where zip :: f a -> f b -> f (a, b) zip = zipWith (,) zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c zipWith f a b = fmap (uncurry f) (zip a b) zip3 :: f a -> f b -> f c -> f (a, b, c) zip3 a b c = zipWith ($) (zipWith (,,) a b) c unzip :: f (a, b) -> (f a, f b) \n Note: This code is missing some functions. zipN up to N=7 should probably be included.

What I'm worried about is getting emscripten to compile the C code (including the lua vm), getting Asterius or ghcjs to compile the Haskell, and getting these linked up somehow.\n Hopefully work in a fork could be upstreamed, but I think having a proof of concept would make that more likely.\n related work:\n  \nhttps://github.com/y-taka-23/wasm-pandoc (works, but no lua filters)\n https://github.com/tweag/asterius/issues/851 (asterius has a demo, but no source, and I -assume no lua filter support)\n  \nI'm also looking for free advice. How should I deal with the C pieces? Turn things into dylibs, something something linking? Does ghcjs have a way to link output from emscripten?

          "description": "Dear haskellers,\n I'm toying with time-series data structures, similar to pandas.DatetimeIndex if you're familiar.\n One thing that I wish I could do was clearly distinguish between unknown frequency, and fixed frequency (e.g. hourly, daily, etc).\n My solution right now is to use phantom types, such as:\n ```haskell import Data.Time (UTCTime) -- from time package newtype Index f = Index [UTCTime]\n data UnknownFreq data Daily\n mkIndex :: [UTCTime] -> Index UnknownFreq\n daily :: UTCTime -> UTCTime -> Index Daily daily start stop = ...\n toDaily :: Index UnknownFreq -> Index Daily toDaily (Index ts) = daily (minimum t) (maximum t) ```\n Then, if I don't export the constructor for Index, it's harder to misuse and have an index which has type frequency Daily, but a real frequency of some other value.\n Another possibility would be to enforce the frequency of the index structurally, e.g.:\n haskell data Frequency = Hourly | Daily data Index = Index { indexStart :: UTCTime , indexStop :: UTCTime , indexFreq :: Frequency } \n but then how can I also track the frequency a the type-level?\n    submitted by    /u/VeloxAquilae  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to isolate the code that runs in the C library in a child process and restart the child process when it crashses, and I want to continue using the Haskell API we built around it. I would like to fork() the Haskell server process but not call execve(), rather have the child process call into the IO () function that runs the foreign code.\n Unfortunately, the System.Process.CmdSpec data type in the process package doesn't allow you to fork an arbitrary IO function, you MUST provide it a path to an executable as a RawCommand or ShellCommand.

The part that I can remember ​ case class Node[T](v: T, left: Option[Node[T]]=None, right: Option[Node[T]]=Node) { def map[R](f: T => R): R = f(v) def flatten = ... // flatten def flatMap = ... // which combines map and flatten } But I can't remember the part about flatten (the problem I suppose is I don't know what I want to flatten for that ⠀Node object), and then flatMap.

Few more discussions followed:\n  \nPerfect Int Loop\n Perfect Time Library\n Boost data processing speed with heavy ops\n  Void Request Pattern\n  GUI Could Be Easy\n  Creating New Numerical Types\n  \nSo the feature set was pretty much complete long time ago and it took many months to refactor, refactor, and refactor. At this stage there are no good ideas on how the project can be improved any more, so it is time to stabilize the code base. From now on the future releases will be binary compatible with version 1.0 and any large changes will be rejected unless absolutely necessary.\n Maintenance wise, based on experience, I expect to spend from 1 to 4 hours a week to fix any incoming bugs and make a new release every 1-3 months. Otherwise, I will move on to invest/trade markets full time, using Scalqa as enabling technology.

I'm a Java developer and I'm using Intellij Idea Ultimate.\n Usually, I use asdf for managing different versions of java, elixir, etc... What is a recommended tool in the Scala world? I see that there is a CLI called coursier. Or should I continue working with asdf? I'm asking this because it seems to me that coursier gives us the option to install additional tools like scalafmt? \n Also, should I pick Intellij Idea for Scala 3? Any first-hand experience here - I saw a couple of posts over here, but they are a couple of months old, so I'm wondering if the situation is better now, or maybe to try with Neovim + native LSP + Metals?\n ​\n To be honest, I expected that tooling will be much more mature for Scala because it is almost mainstream language :)\n ​\n Thanks in advance for your suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/milnik79  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I recently decided to go back to FP / Akka Scala (I've been absent in the space since 2019, still programming in Scala but more on OOP side). I have a lot of experience recently in distributed computing using Spark or Flink and I really like how these frameworks solve many issues that could go wrong in reality (offering automatic node failure recovery, effectively-once semantics etc).\n I started exploring ZIO and Akka Streams lately and I feel like there would be a lot of burden to run distributed computation using either of those. Especially to solve the issues I mentioned earlier. For me both of these focus mostly on single-node applications that would not scale in reality. I see that by the use of Fibers I can achieve high resource utilization on a single node. I can imagine buildin…",

          "description": "Most developers choose the path of least resistance. Effect systems are not low resistance and its very hard for experienced functional programmers to explain why its so great. Even ZIO that makes it a little bit more straight forward is still a huge leap from where most programmers are. \n Compare this to say Rust. Rust requires more from the programmers but the rules around borrowing and lifetimes are relativly easy to understand it takes a while to learn fully. But the motivation is there because its performance and its measurable. Do you want your programms to be 2x+ fast then writ it in Rust.\n Effects systems are very abstract concepts. First that you are describing a program in a program. Then the notion that non purity is bad. Monads, functors etc. There is alot to understand because in the long run you need to understand them.\n I'm currently learning and I like it. Not that I'm fully aware of all benefits but I like learning. \n When I look at the majority of programmers that I have worked with. They like their job and they program in whatever language they happened to end up with and very few wants to invest in learning a whole new paradigm. It's so hard to get developers to let go of Java 8 some times. Most Java developers have probably never used records in Java. \n So what am I getting to. I don't know actually :-D just something I have been thinking about. \n What do you think. Can effect systems ever be mainstream? I can't really see it ever happening if most developers doesn't suddenly become super interested in learning new stuff.\n Also if you believe it can go mainstream how us it going to happen?\n    submitted by    /u/0OOO00000OO00O0O0OOO  \n [link]   [comments]",

The reason is that we are a data engineering team, and none of us are familiar with Golang stack. We re-code it to improve maintainability.\n The logic is extremely simple, the HTTP server just listens for POST requests, based on the extract the payload in raw bytes and forward to Kafka. There are mappings of 1:1 between the URI and Kafka topic so that we know where to forward the events, something like https://blah.com/api/v1/app_events -> app_events Kafka topic. These mappings are fixed and provisioned from a config file.\n Previously, with the Go (Gin) version, with 1 Core, we are able to reach 2.5K RPS. Now, with the Akka HTTP version, we could not go higher than 1.1K RPS.\n The Akka HTTP version is 10.2.7.\n Initially, we thought It could be the Kafka producer that slows the server down, but it wasn't, without the Kafka producer, RPS did not improve.\n Is this a valid outcome? That we have to accept that Go(Gin) is >2x faster than Akka HTTP?\n ==== Updated =====\n I was just performed another loadtest because I suspected at my usage of optionalHeaderValueByName directive. This time, I held down the CCU setting from Locust side to 500 as I wanted to see how much CPU it cost in each case.\n  \nWith optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 380m CPU.\n Without optionalHeaderValueByName: cost ~ 270m CPU.\n  \nThis turned out the header extraction directive contributes significantly to CPU cost.\n Source code: https://www.reddit.com/r/Akka/comments/s7fcur/comment/htazqaa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n    submitted by    /u/misurin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Boopickle seems to support Scala 3 by now (though not chameleon which sloth uses to abstract away boopickle).\n Since Scala 3 should enable this kind of functionality without the headache inducing macro code required on 2.x, what would people recommend as a Scala 3 solution for client-service communications, with as little boilerplate as possible, and ideally using boopickle (it's much smaller than the equivalent json and I like the obfuscation) ?\n It's all Scala front-to-back, no need to care about any other language or format, and I'm not opposed to switching it all out in order to move to Scala 3.\n Thank you for any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/androidthepandroid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Incoming messages are received via the following API. \n def receiveMessage(msg: Message): Task[Unit]\n msg parameter has access to Chat id\n \n Bot executes every x hours (via Monix scheduler) and sends a message to all chats that have subscribed. \n  \nIf I were to implement this imperatively, I’d have a dynamically sized list as a class field of MyBot, add a chatId to that list (mutating) when I receive a subscription request. Every x hours the message execution function would then reference the chatId list field. \n How exactly do I encapsulate this behavior into a self-updating Task, or a series of Tasks? \n Thanks in advance!\n In case it helps I'm using this library https://github.com/bot4s/telegram for telegram API.\n    submitted by    /u/hplazerjet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, \n I am currently working through a purescript book and really enjoying everything I’m learning! I’m currently working through implementing stock Prelude functions. Apply and flip were easy enough to understand:\n apply :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b apply f x = f x\n flip :: forall a b c. (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c flip f x y = f y x\n Now, for the implementation of applyFlipped, the book implements it as:\n applyFlipped :: forall a b. a -> (a -> b) -> b applyFlipped = flip apply\n So from my understanding, applyFlipped accepts two arguments: a parameter of type a, and a function that accepts a parameter of type a and returns a parameter of type b. Because purescript is implicitly right-associative, that would mean that the function with explicit parameters would read:\n applyFlipped x f = (flip (apply x f))\n My question is: why does the compiler interpret this as flip with parameters apply, x, and f, rather than interpreting it as apply with parameters x and f (which wouldn’t compile), whose result is a parameter for flip?\n    submitted by    /u/helplesslyclever  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far, I have successfully managed to convert all my configuration files and custom shell scripts into Org files that tangle into the proper file formats, but I have been unsuccessful in doing so for my custom snippets. I have several snippets meant for Org-mode, an example being a file with its content being the following:\n # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC \n The snippet will create a source block that will tangle its contents into `user-config.el'. The problem with this is that I cannot get such a file out just by doing what I normally do to tangle files. I tried the following:\n #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle test.sh # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC #+end_src \n I tried to distinguish the real source block from the one that I wish to be exported literally by using indents and different capitalisation but the file I get by tangling this is\n  # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 \n It clearly cuts off at the first #+END_SRC block. It's not a crippling issue but seeing how I have a whole directory of non-Org files in a repository of only Org files is quite uncomfortable.

I occasionally want to link to an email from an Org file and want to know how to do it in a robust way. Linking to an email that is still in my INBOX works, but as soon as it expires the link is dead. I thought using gnus-cache-enter-article (bound to *) would instruct Gnus to keep the email around so the link would continue to work, but it doesn't: oddly Gnus still shows the starred email in my INBOX even if it is marked as expired, but the Org link stops working.\n I don't delete any email from my Gmail account so in principle I could have long-lasting links to emails there. I bet somebody has already figured out what to do. I can think of a few possibilities:\n  \nMaybe there's a way to process the links to point to [Gmail]/All Mail instead, which seem to last longer, but I believe the also stop working after a while (I'm not sure they do, but I have a vague recollection of testing this once, maybe the Gmail IMAP implementation is responsible for the impermanence).\n \nMaybe * doesn't keep the links working, but Gnus has several other ways of marking messages to be kept and one of those methods works (I'm no expert on Gnus!).\n \nMaybe there's a convenient way to keep locally copies of the messages in another Gnus backend? Like maybe I can copy a message to some other account which I only use for local storage, and link to that copy instead?\n \n Does anyone have a good method for this, using any of those ideas or a different better one?\n    submitted by    /u/oantolin  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to switch to a different buffer 'B' (which may be anywhere), but I actually want to search buffer B and maybe copy some results over to the current buffer. This could be using consult-line or occur.\n How I am going about the above: \n  \nswitch buffer (consult-buffer) \n \nHit embark-act on the desired buffer (bound to C-. as default)\n \nChoose either C-s (embark-isearch) or C and l for consult-line \n \nHowever - the search chosen above always takes place on the current buffer A. I want to act on Buffer B that I chose in the minibuffer.\n \n My config for these packages is pretty vanilla, mostly borrowed off the README's of these packages with some functions stolen from the authors of the packages.\n    submitted by    /u/shryzr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just started learning emacs (macport) about 10 days ago, Avy is the first package I've installed. So I have some questions.\n FIRST QUESTION Was there a particular reason for Oleh Krehel to suggest binding avy-goto-char to C-: instead of C-;? Since C-; doesn't require the shift key, that would be seem to be a preferred binding for frequent navigation. (Perhaps colon C-; conflicts with some other popular binding?)\n SECOND ISSUE He suggests (from https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) possibly setting up default bindings using \n  \n(avy-setup-default) \n  \nBut that doesn't seem to work for me.

And what is isearch-mode-map? That function doesn't seem to exist in my beginner level emacs. What does avy-resume do?

Use C-h v? Is there another way? \n Regardless, one thing I'd like to be able to do (just to know if it's possible) is highlight that web text, copy to the MacOS cut-and-past buffer, then in emacs, C-h v and it prompts me Describe Variable:. Is there a way to just paste/yank the name at that point? C-y didn't work before, but now it does, so this use-case is solved.\n In another use-case, suppose I might have the variable name in my emacs buffer/window, with point on the variable name. Is there a way to \"send\" what's under the point to C-h v for quick inspection?\n Or another way to \"evaluate\" the variable so that I can see what it is?\n I'm currently using Ido, if that matters.

EXCEPT, mouse scrolling should work too, and here I've run into the fact that I don't really know how emacs works. I've seen this is a question on the issue tracker without resolution:\n https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/issues/390\n I see that as I scroll the mouse, or more accurately touchpad, I get wheel-down/double-wheel-down/triple-wheel-down (or up) and these are all mapped to the same (Mac specific?) event: mac-mwheel-scroll but as expected, mapping all the various mouse events I see in lossage to mac-mwheel-scroll doesn't work. In fact, mapping them even to normal scroll events only SORT of works.\n Anyone have any hints? My temporary \"solution\" is to just use the hydra that allows for other keys, but that is causing some serious OCD. I was thinking of defining a pre command hook that detects whether I am in a hydra and what the command is, but that seems like a hack if there ever was one.

Especially considering that the likelihood of the bug actually being in helpful is not very high, it's more probable that it's somewhere else in my config -- I've seen it before, just less often.\n By digging through Emacs source, I've been able to find that the actual source of the message is face-attributes-as-vector, a function defined in xfaces.c. Deep in the C code. That's the only place anywhere I can find this error message text.\n Now I'm trying to trace the calls to it to find out just where and what resulted in the nil :family and nothing seems to work, neither trace.el nor Edebug -- it just prints the message and goes off on its merry way. Manually advising it with something to the tune of (defun trace-face-attrs (a-plist) (message \"Tracing: %s\" a-plist)) (advice-add 'face-attributes-as-vector :before #'trace-face-attrs) doesn't result in advice function getting called either.\n It's like the function isn't actually getting called at all.\n How do I get at the root of this damned thing?\n    submitted by    /u/rn3aoh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using ansi-term for a while, and I recently tried switching to vterm. It looks and works pretty well, but I'm having a problem with how vterm cycles through your command history. In zsh, if you type something and press the up arrow key, you get the last command you used that starts with what you've already typed. This works fine in ansi-term, but in vterm, it just cycles to the last command that was used in that vterm session. I was wondering if anyone knew if there was any configuring that I need to do on either end to get this to behave the same way in vterm as it does in ansi-term.\n ---EDIT--- Editing to clarify that it's specifically the matching of the already typed command that's not working. I can cycle through the history without issue, but sometimes I'm sshing onto a machine, or doing a repetitive task, and prefer to have zsh search for the right command for me.\n    submitted by    /u/jensensanssarif  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is perfect for organizing material for my novels, and I even use Mu4e for e-mails by now.\n I would be happy to try to write my next novel with emacs. But there is one thing that just drives me crazy writing prose in emacs, and I wonder whether there is a solution to it. (Olivetti Mode or Writeroom mode do not solve this, regrettably.)\n When writing prose, I don't want to have a blank line between each paragraph, but to have them indented instead. It just looks awkard to me, to have lines of dialogue like this:\n \"I met another woman\", he said.\n .\n \"Who is it?\"\n .\n \"You don't know her.\"\n .\n She gave him a furious stare.\n ​\n ​\n It reather should look like this:\n ​\n \"I met another woman\", he said.\n ..... \"Who is it?\"\n ..... \"You don't know her.\"\n ..... She gave him a furious stare.\n ​\n (Reddit deletes blank space, I had to put dots there.)\n But the indentation shouldn't be Tabs or Spaces, it should just be how emacs displays the buffer.\n Is there a way to make this possible, a way to write prose without blank lines between the paragraphs and to have the first line of each paragraph indented?\n Formatted text properties like \"indent more\" insert spaces. Maybe this is the way emacs is made, and there is no way to just visually indent (like in a word processor) without putting characters in the document.\n Thank you so much for any help on this!\n Titus\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I use --with-mailutils while building emacs (Or not) for that ?\n I raised this query on IRC emacs and many people mentioned it's not required, but didn't explain clearly why. If it's not required, and If I can setup a client by just adding some mail handling packages later on, then,\n 2. I'm wondering what is the use of --with-mailutils, while building ?\n Now that's not the only confusion. I've went through the MailUtils page (assuming that's what emacs will be building, if I specify the option). It mentions that it provides rich set of utilities for mail handling, so why would anyone say not to use it. Does it make Emacs bulky or anything. Idk. I'm just assuming (since they said no).

I've now had the profiler start by default and tried to look at the profiler report right after I notice the lag, but that hasn't given me any clues. \n I'm thinking of resetting the profiler every few seconds or so to see if that helps, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows of another way to figure out what's going on. \n I've been reluctant to bisect my init since as I said before sometimes hours go by without running into this problem.\n    submitted by    /u/graduale  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As react is now the most popular FE framework by a mile (and I and countless others work in it daily), it drives me crazy there's no major-mode for it. I've done a ton of googling and tried a lot of solutions people put online, and I did have some that worked decently well, but none are perfect and the one I was just using broke after an update (like many I've tried before have). I feel like the best solution would be to just write a major-mode for it, it would help keep a lot of web devs on emacs who like the extensibility but are frustrated by the amount of work it takes to just get jsx/tsx to be supported like they are in every other major editor (maybe vim aside, I never use it so I can't say).\n I have some basic emacs experience, I've been using it daily for about 3 years and have fiddled around with some packages and gone through elisp tutorials and even built some dumb programs to play around (like a tic-tac-toe game), but I honestly don't know the first thing about writing a major mode, and while I've read some tutorials on doing so I know people who have experience doing this have a much better idea of what would need to be done, how to break down the work required, and what modern tools (thinking treesitter) could be used to make the syntax parsing, etc much easier.\n I do work full time and am also doing my MBA, but I'd be more than happy to dedicate a night or two a week to get this moving. Unless there's something else out there or someone has started on something, I'd be more than happy to contribute, I just need some guidance on getting up to speed on everything required for a fully-functional major mode. Hopefully this isn't some pipe dream, I feel like with tree-sitter and lsp (and the foundational work already done for other js modes) we could come up with something really solid.

Although I've made it comfortable for myself now, I think I'd have to throw more effort at it in the future.\n  \n​\n Pros for Logseq:\n  \nModern UI (it is not a clear win compared to emacs though)\n User-friendly note-taking. And I don't have to maintain my config. For example, using [[page]] to reference or create another page, viewing all journals in one page, etc.\n More note-taking related functions. For example, Zotero support, taking notes with, NLP (not yet, but in their roadmap), etc.\n FLOSS!\n  \nCons for Logseq:\n  \nHard to migrate. The format is too customized. But I think it is a common problem for doubly-linked note systems.\n Org-mode support is not that great. Inter-operatability is not as good as expected.\n  \n​\n There are also different considerations w.r.t. note taking:\n  \nWhen pressing enter, Logseq insert a new node as default instead of a newline as in Emacs.\n  \n​\n To me, Logseq seems to be a very modern and promising note system, while Emacs remains a lot more reliable. It is really hard to choose between those two.\n    submitted by    /u/aur3l14no  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works for individual tasks in the org file, but this is quite cumbersome if I wanted to upload my entire org file's scheduled tasks. I tried org-gcal-sync-buffer when I was in the org file, but it only uploaded the individual tasks that already had the org-gcal property to the calendar and ignored the other scheduled tasks. Is there a solution to upload everything in the org file at once?\n 2) I was wondering if a solution had already been implemented for dealing with recurring tasks in org mode and being implemented into the calendar yet?

          "description": "I have been using org-roam for some time now and have a collection of multiple org files which are org-roam nodes stored in a folder called ~/Roamnotes. While capturing notes, I have setup org-roam to directly write to *.org.gpg files so that they get encrypted upon creation. Emacs uses EasyPG Assistant to encrypt and decrypt files automatically. So during my routine org-roam-node-find operation where I am trying to open one of the org-roam nodes (or files), EasyPG starts automatically decrypting all the nodes in my org-roam folder. This is normal and logical.\n My problem: The process of decryption is quite slow and I think could be handled by multi-processing the decryption of nodes via an external program or if possible in an async way.\n ​\n Is there a way to do this better? My roam notes collection is growing bigger and bigger and I fear that there might come a point where I might have to start the org-file decryption, take a nap and come back to it once I am awake.\n It is important for me to store my roam notes encrypted as I use them on my work and my personal computer (synced via syncthing) and it contains some quite sensitive information. One option I thought was to only encrypt files with sensitive information and keep the rest open, but this adds an overhead of always keeping in mind what I want to encrypt and what not.\n    submitted by    /u/shaggy_amreeki  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not because I'm trying to learn a completely new keyboard system but because of the exact opposite of that; My laziness. Long story short I instantly jumped into Ergoemacs.

The dev was talking about customization and two things specifically caught my attention; The sentence \"These keys are defined in the ergoemacs-keymap\" and the word \"ergoemacs-layout-us.el\" I been trying to locate these two things for the past five hours. I checked every little bit of creators Github I check every file that came with the package I checked every command related to Ergoemacs.\n Now I am aware that I can just write them one by one into my M-x as in the guide but I want to see the available ones and edit them. Or I can write them in my init.el using global keys but I have a slight order problem, I want things to go in one place ergoemacs-layout-us.el to be exact.\n This is probably got longer than it should be but cut me a slack will ya I've been sitting here for two days with 5 hours of sleep, talking to no one, and trying to tame the majestic beast that is Emacs.\n Thank you for listening my rant...

By the looks of things, web-mode attempts to implement these things, but I'm not developing templates for HTML. To make matters worse, I cannot indent within templating engine code blocks (white space has meaning). Think code which generates python code.\n What I'm currently looking for is a minor mode which highlights not only syntax (e.g. {% if foo %}Do stuff{% endif %} - but also clearly marks the background of the code block, e.g.\n  {% if foo %} do stuff {% if bar %} Do Other Things {% endif %} more stuff {% endif %} \n Where the entire text block for do stuff and more stuff has a background color of red, then Do Other Things being an inner code block has a color of green (and additional nested blocks get new colors). Obviously red/green are examples and real world colors would be more aesthetic ;). \n rainbow-delimiters ( https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters/ ) does this for parenthesis/braces etc but is somewhat bound to the syntax tree of whatever major mode is currently in use, it also scans on a per-character basis, where I'd need to scan for regex. \n I've had a go using font-lock-add-keywords with regex, and while it would work for unnested code, I have no idea how to sanely deal with inner conditionals (e.g. in the above example, currently it will regex start the first if statement, but end before 'more stuff' as the lazy end terminates there. \n Can anyone provide advice on how to achieve this, or if somebody has implemented it in the past?

It's somewhat daunting for someone who is not an expert like me.\n Do you guys have any advice on how to customize emacs in a simple yet efficient way (I know there are some pre-configured distros like doom or space, I still have to look into those)? My aim is to be able to add whatever feature to my emacs config easily because I want it to be feature rich.\n In the end, emacs seems to be a really powerful tool compared to vscode (which I think is already pretty powerful), but it's not clear *how* you should use it...\n    submitted by    /u/Dumb-Ptr  \n [link]   [comments]",

If so, how would one accomplish this within a minor mode definition?\n Thanks\n Edit: After I posted here I found a similar problem to mine, which the poster solved with an OS-level workaround.

Let me try to explain:\n I've written a minor-mode for reading that affects some already buffer-local variables, like indicate-empty-lines, or blink-cursor-mode, etc. These are variables that might already have buffer-local values that I want to persist as I'm toggling my minor mode on and off (in my specific case, I want to turn reading-mode on when I enter view-mode, and off when I exit that mode).\n My current implementation can be found in my emacs configuration, but it doesn't work correctly and I feel like there might be a better way built-in to Emacs.

But the \"output\" of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.\nBut I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. \"who quoted whom\", \"who learned from whom\", \"who wrote letters with whom\", etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.\nThe question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two \"boxes\", one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do \"double bookkeeping\" and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?\nTo reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.",

          "description": "Hello Zettelkasten friends,\nI've made a few packages for working with my archive in Emacs, and thought you might like to take a look.\nThe general package, \"zk,\" is a basic set of functions for working with notes -- creating new notes, creating links, finding backlinks, renaming, searching, etc. It uses only built-in features of Emacs --- so no external dependencies. And it can be extended and modified in all the ways that Emacs can be extended and modified. My thought is that it could provide a baseline for people to fork and craft a set of functions to their own liking.\nIt just became available on Melpa and you can see a demonstration here: https://youtu.be/BixlUK4QTNk\nThe other package is called \"zk-index,\" offers two additional interfaces for browsing your notes.\nThe \"ZK-Index\" interface is a persistent listing of notes, in a dedicated buffer, that can be sorted (by date of modification or creation) and narrowed down by title or note contents.\nThe other interface, called \"ZK-Desktop\" (included in \"zk-index\"), offers a way of working with smaller selections of notes, for specific projects for example. You can select notes from the index to \"send to the desktop,\" where you can arrange them however you want, add commentary about the arrangements, etc. Like working with notecards on a desktop.\nYou can see a demontration of the index and desktop features here: https://youtu.be/7qNT87dphiA\n\n\nNote that \"zk-index\" is still a work in progress, so it's only available in the dev branch of the zk repository. But it's been working for me, so if you give it a shot and have some notes, please let me know, either here or in Github Issues!\nOn compatibility, \"zk\" is fairly configurable, so it should be able to work with your current archive, maybe with a little configuring. I started my own note-taking using \"The Archive,\" and the format of my notes and hasn't changed at all, so these packages should (I hope!) work with your existing archive.\nLet me know what you think!",

I know they are valid in filenames, and are at least addressed in URLs/URIs, but they seem to add just a little fragility to what is otherwise pretty solid without spaces.\nI'm about to embrace wholeheartedly the community's recommendation of a unique ID in the filename, followed by the plain English name.  I see the automation benefits of having the (Markdown) h1 in the Zettel being the same as the file name, so that leans me towards accepting spaces.  But one of my goals here is a pretty rigorous future proofing, portability, and stability.\nHave you all given this some thought and decided that spaces in file names are just not a problem at all?  If so, my set of files are still small enough that I can swap strategies.\nThank you for any advice you can give.",

This was mainly because, first, of the need to differentiate between \"public\" and \"private\" notes; and then to provide for some special behaviour depending on the different use-cases. I came to invent things like § [[1234]] to denote a \"public\" reference to a note to be printed; > [[1234]] for the insertion of notes containing quotes or fragments; > [[1234]] :: [[1235]] for parallel, bilingual texts. I tried my best to give appropriate documentation of these features in the project's README.\nPlease excuse the fact that the code is a bit messy. This is not only the result of a long process of back-and-forth experimentation but because this project was also the personal attempt to learn some Python of someone inexperienced with the language.\nThis project had some of its initial inspiration in books like this (V. Goldschmit's Le système stoïcien et l'idée de temps. Paris, 1953):\n\n\nYou may clone the project or copy the script from GitHub.",

Discussion could result in most universally valuable features being implemented in future builds.\nFunction 1 (software-implemented): Optional Visual Hierarchical Display of Saved Searches\nWithout affecting any other functionality, saved searched should be able to be organized into a visual expandable drop-down hierarchy, which again does not affect any other functionality, so does not implement hierarchical structuring into any aspect of the application other than the visual representation of the saved searches in the sidebar. This has obvious beneficial functionality without breaking the app. Feel free to discuss.\nFunction 2 (user-implemented): Bundled Tags\nRight now, if I have tags #apple #banana & #pear, I am able to create a saved search called \"Fruits\" which saves the search query as \"#apple OR #banana OR #pear\". It would be advisable, in some instances, for you as the user to add the category name itself as a tag to the existing search parameters, such that the new search query is now saved as \"#apple OR #banana OR #pear or #fruits\". This allows the saved search to function as a category as well as a tag.\nI call these types of saved searches \"Categories\", and the tags that represent the saved search redundantly \"Category Tags\"\n^^^ Combining the above two functions does not deviate from to the existing principles underpinning the stated purpose of this application, yet it does serve to improve the functionality in terms of specificity (via Tags) and inclusion (via Categories).\nFurther extending these functions, one can imagine a nested list of category tags\nFor examples of infinite-depth, internally-nested collapsible lists - which would all be great functionality add to the \"Saved Searches\" sidebar of the Archive - check out the Workflowy app: https://workflowy.com/\nThe concepts in this post are not property of their author.
