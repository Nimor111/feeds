          "description": "So I was solving a couple of problems on hackerrank using haskell and I came across a question where the Data.Vector package might be useful. So ideally what I would like is since vector is not available by default, is to install it where ghc and ghci is able to see it and import Data.Vector and :m Data.Vector just works and call it a day. Kind of like in c, where you sudo apt install <package>, and #include <package> works.\n Apparently for some reason it seems like a very difficult task to do. Every website/forum which I read suggest to set up a full fledged application with cabal init and then cabal install. \n I learned that cabal packages and ghc packages are two different things (cabal list --installed and ghc-pkg list). Both maintain their own package databases (installed packages) and ghc and ghci can only see and work with ghc packages. Theres this command cabal install --libs but people on github are saying it can cause some issues and suggest against it (with one person saying it outright \"evil\"). \n I couldn't find a straightforward solution to this except years old articles and tons of open issues on github with people having similar problems.\n Is there no simple way to achieve this than to manually download or cabal init?\n    submitted by    /u/Patzer26  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As I get deeper into learning haskell I have noticed what seems to be \"Imperative Creep\" for the lack of a better term.\n It seems as the code gets more \"real world\" it becomes ever more imperative. In many examples across the web I see code very similar to the imperative style of a language like python. I'm not really understanding the point of all the great functional aspects of the language if you can't write functional code for real world use cases.\n I't's very confusing for a beginner to wrap their brains around the functional paradigm. Then, almost immediately after understanding this new programming concept you're hit with the Monad and all the educational literature starts you a new with imperative code - it's maddening. Every tutorial explains that \"do\" notation makes it easier to grok the monad by allowing a more imperative approach. WTF.\n I'm not changing any minds for certain. But, honestly I think this \"crutch\" has hampered my absorption of the learning material and perhaps increased the learning curve. Additionally this also makes the beautiful syntax of haskell look more like some JS crap with all the \"do\" \"if\" and \"case\", I mean really you can't use functors, applicatives or monads with \"pattern-matching\", \"guards\" and \"where\". Perhaps I have not learned anything of functional programming?\n I'm just ranting, apologies for the negative vibes.

Shouldn't building a package be one of the last steps in a project?\n What do people do if they, say only want to try out a package? With python for example you would probably create a virtual environment, install the package in it, import it in your source file and go.\n The analog to that solution would be sandboxes I assume, but as far as I understand those are depreciated these days.\n I used Haskell ~3 years ago, always installed packages globally, and then worked mainly with ghci. This was probably not ideal back then, but seems to not even work quite the same way today (cabal install <package> says <package> is not exposed or something along these lines).\n From what I read here, it seems that a \"python like workflow\" maybe works when working with nix (instead of cabal?).\n Can somebody help lift my confusion?

I did try with Haskell before, like in 3-4 occasions (for the first time more than 10 years ago), but usually I just gave up (primary because of lack time and the things were going slow, so I just lose motivation and interest).\n Now I want to do the right thing and push it all the way to the \"end\" (== actually write something, then improve it further by pra…",

It's annoying because, even if I use the treesitter integration to, say, select the object, delete it, move to the other side of the arrow, and paste it in, I still have to go and write/delete a load of ->. Admittedly, this isn't a big deal, but I remember when I was playing with clojure many years ago in vim, and I sort of loved the ability, via vim-sexp, to move things around -- into lists, out of lists, forward and backwards within a list, etc..\n I was therefore thinking: \"I wonder if it's possibly to do this in my editor\", and wanted to start with something as simple as \"can I move the argument backwards / forwards\", by which I mean, with respect to the greet function defined above: \"can I swap the Person and Lang arguments so instead of greet myPerson EN I do greet EN myPerson?\"\n I thought maybe treesitter would be a nice way to achieve this, but I really have no idea where to start (and if there is a better way).

The main focus of this release is the ability to serve Swagger UI from the server with ease and ability to create clients from the same code as servers. I'm happy to confirm that both goals are reached with this release. \n The tutorial for library was created.\n Also there are many other improvements:\n  \nOpenApi schema for servers\n swagger servers support (we can add swagger to server with one line of code: withSwagger def server )\n clients from the same code as servers\n redesign of internal types\n redesign of DSL for routes\n many ergonomic improvements\n packages for extra utils\n split of mig package to several packages: \n mig - core\n mig-wai - rendering servers to wai apps\n mig-client - clients\n mig-extra - extra utils\n mig-server - mig servers with batteries\n mig-swagger-ui - swagger ui server\n \n tutorial and quickstart guide on github pages\n CI for repo with formatter, build and tests and update of docs on github pages\n  \nThe internal type for Servers was redesigned so that we assemble handler function with API description at the same time. In the first release it was just handler function under the hood.\n As a refresher mig is a family of libraries to write lightweight, simple, type-safe and composable servers. It strives to be in the middle ground between scotty and servant. To be composable, flexible and type-safe as servant and simple and lightweight in concepts as scotty.\n Thanks to Ambros for contribution. Also I'd like to thank authors of packages servant, servant-swagger-ui and servant-openapi3 packages for inspiration for my work in this release.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.17 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.\n Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA's Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.\n This release introduces compatibility with what4 versions up to 1.5.1, and replaces several functions in copilot-core. The second change is a breaking change: the functions replaced have been deprecated and new alternatives introduced instead.\n As always, we're releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Jan 7th, 2024.\n In our last announcement, we mentioned that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-libraries and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].\n There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We'll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned.

Their claims are typically based off self-reported evaluations on the HumanEval benchmark. But when you look into that benchmark, you realize that it only consists of 164 Python programming problems.\n This led me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how helpful LLMs actually are with different programming, scripting, and markup languages. I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit.

Knowing that set theory is one such system, I began to wonder whether it's possible to write a program, for which it's impossible to prove that it never stops. Such a program, I imagine, would be able to describe set-theoretic theorems as values of some data type, then, given a set of axioms, combine those axioms using logic to form all the theorems of set theory. Then traverse those theorems and check if any of them are equivalent to a negation of one of the axioms, thus proving that set theory is inconsistent and causing the program to halt. For a program like that, you can't show that it never stops, because that would require showing that set theory is consistent, which is impossible to do using set theory. The problem is, I have no idea how to write a program like that or where to even start. I thought haskell would be a good choice, because it's already pretty close to math.

The compiler will prevent you from using null when the non-nullable version of the type is expected. You can pass in the plain non-null version of the type into any function that takes in the nullable type. The nullable type is a union between the non-nullable type and null.\n Kotlin is a good example of a language like this. Typescript kinda mostly does it. I don't know C# very well but I think the latest version finally fixed the initial nightmare they started with.\n Haskell, on the other hand, has Maybe. Maybe is a sum type, rather than a union type. If a function takes in a Maybe String, then you can't pass a String into the function.\n One advantage nullable types have over Maybe is that it's backwards compatible to weaken preconditions and strengthen postconditions. \n If your library has a function\n fun doIt(foo: String): Int?\n Then in the next version, you can change the signature to\n fun doIt(foo: String?): Int\n In a backwards compatible way. In Haskell, changing\n doIt :: String -> Maybe Int\n To \n doIt :: Maybe String -> Int\n Is a breaking change.\n Is there an advantage to representing optionality as a unique sum type, rather than a nullable union type?\n    submitted by    /u/shrinking_dicklet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m happy to announce the release of vty version 6.0. The highlight of this release is that vty now works on Windows, thanks to hard work by Chris Hackett and Timofey Zakrevskiy! For years, many people in the Haskell community have requested Windows support in vty. Thanks to Chris and Timofey for the time and energy they put into this, and their patience as we worked out an approach! Thanks also to Eric Mertens and Kevin Quick for early feedback on the release.\n In this release, the core \"vty\" package was reorganized so that support for specific platforms now lives in platform-specific packages that need to be used alongside the core \"vty\" package. This release includes the release of three aditional new packages:\n  \nvty-unix (Unix terminal support previously provided by \"vty\")\n vty-windows (the Windows backend)\n vty-crossplatform (for when you want to support both)\n  \nThe core package still provides all of the important library functionality and is still a necessary dependency. Applications will need to depend on an additional package for the platform that they need to support. When in doubt, use vty-crossplatform!\n The release changelog update has a detailed listing of changes as well as instructions for how to update your application to work with Vty 6.\n To get help, please open an issue on the Vty repository.\n While I'm at it, Brick has been updated to use vty-crossplatform in version 2.0!\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/jtdaugherty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know GHC has had some cross compilation abilities for a while but I'm interested in what the difficulty rating would likely be to use this in production, with modern tools like Stack and GHC 9.x. For context while I understand a bit about how different compiler back ends (such as LLVM) can be used with GHC, things such as trying to build custom instances of GHC from source would score high on my difficulty scale.\n The reason I'm asking is that I develop a homebrew application that supports Windows and Linux and my Windows machine has suffered a hardware failure, which is serious enough that I may decide to salvage it and build a new machine. I'm interested in the idea of going Linux only and using cross compilation and WINE as a way to maintain a Windows build environment.

          "description": "Apologies if the following seems dumb. I’m trying to figure something out with cats-effect-3 and scala. I have the following class structure:\n ``` trait Resource { def execute(): F[Output] }\n class A[F[_]] extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = ??? }\n class B[F[_]](a: A[F]) extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] = { a.execute().flatMap(…) } } ```\n Each Resource type has an execute method whose output I want to memoize. So that dependent classes (there may be a third class C that can call a.execute) may call it multiple times in any order but they will all get the same value as a result. This would be pretty straightforward with scala’s Future (if I use It instead of F).\n I‘ve seen Async.memoize. However, that changes the signature to F[F[Output]] and I can only execute the “outer” flatMap once, or the results are re-calculated. In this case, I’m not sure how I would allow the dependent classes to use the memoized output.\n I’m relatively new to the Typelevel ecosystem, and I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this correctly. How would I modify the code such that my effect gets executed only once, no matter how many times I call it?\n Should I use the non-typelevel concurrency primitives to handle this outside the effect-system and then wrap it in F?\n I know I can probably orchestrate the “graph” of execution without having each dependent class doing this. But I need to chain the calls these way for the time being.\n ——\n UPDATE [2023/11/20]: For now, I’m going with an AtomicCell that wraps an Option value, and setting it to Some if it’s None (the initial value) using evalUpdateAndGet. This doesn’t seem very elegant though.\n    submitted by    /u/bhashit  \n [link]   [comments]",

My IDE of choice is IntelliJ, so I tried to make it work there, but so far, not very successfully.\n The first attempt was \"the way I know\" - build using Maven and use the IntelliJ Scala plugin for everything. But there was basically no help from the IDE (no autocomplete etc.).\n So I tried doing it \"the Scala way\" - installed SBT, created a project using the official guide, imported as a BSP project into Intellij using this guide and everything seemed to work - I can run the thing at least :-)\n But when I try to Ctrl+Click something from the standard library (like Seq or max on an Iterable), the IDE navigates to sources of 2.13 instead of 3.3.1. I tried enabling the BSP logs and the classpath SBT is returning is something like\n [ \"file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/classes/\", \"file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/test-classes\", \"file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala3-library_3/3.3.1/scala3-library_3-3.3.1.jar\", \"file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.10/scala-library-2.13.10.jar\" ] \n is it OK that it's sending both Scala 2 and 3 jars? How can I make IntelliJ go to the Scala 3 stdlib on Ctrl+click?\n I'm sure I must be doing a simple msitake somewhere, but I'm out of ideas what to try. I already tried creating a new project from scratch, updating Intellij to the latest version, reinstalling SBT, nothing helps...\n Thanks in advance for any help or pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/snugar_i  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's compiling just fine, but I'm getting run time errors:\n java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information: localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:8087 \n Is there a way to handle this without having to fork and/or compile my own versions of Shardcake and Caliban locally until a release or snapshot is made with zio-http-RC3 (or some other future version that has the features I want)? I think I remember having a similar issue in the past because I wanted to use tapir with Caliban and each had a dependency on a different version of zio-http... I got it to compile and then run by breaking up the project into several sub-projects making sure there were no overlaps in dependencies, but this was kind of unwieldy considering it was a fairly small project, so I'd rather not do that again.\n Do correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've read this isn't an Scala-only thing and also affects Java, so I'm wondering if there's a commonly known workaround for this that I don't know of (maybe some eviction policies in the sbt file, or in Java's case pom file?).\n    submitted by    /u/ToreroAfterOle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A recent post got me thinking about how we might go about extracting nested optional values with the convenience of Kotlin and TypeScript, but while still leveraging Scala's rich monadic types. Odersky's comment on another post indicated a way to reproduce a version of the ? syntax using Scala's boundary/break. His example works only with A | Null values, however. I wanted to see if I could accomplish the same while:\n  \nSupporting ? on any optional/failable type,\n Preserving failure types by returning an Either and tracking any failure types encountered in the get chain, and\n Still avoid any intermediate allocations (only construct the Either at the end)\n  \nYou can see my attempt in this gist\n The syntax is:\n val result: Either[F1 | F2 | F3, A] = getEither(obj1.?.obj2.?.obj3) \n Where F1, F2, and F3 are the failure types of obj1, obj2, and obj3. Option fails with Unit, Try fails with Throwable, and Either fails with its left type.\n I'm doubtful I'd ever actually use this: having to a) import `getEither` and `?`, b) wrap the statement in `getEither`, and c) add a dot before each `?` seems like just a little more would make me skip the usual syntax, but it was fun and interesting to work out how to do it. I'd be curious to hear others' thoughts.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Along similar lines, it occurred to me that you could produce an implementation of Option that has no allocation overhead. You can check out my attempt at that here. It just uses A | Null under the hood as an opaque type. It's two limitations that I know of are:\n  \ntoString does not show None or Some(x) but null and x (this is just a limitation of opaque types)\n I can't figure out a way to implement exhaustive extractors. Instead, you can use the fold method (which I've been using more and more these days anyways)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/jivesishungry  \n [link]   [comments]",

I created two files GettingStarted and List, both of which I selected as new Scala classes and then Objects in Intellij.\n  \nI've noticed that I can only have one main function. I can't put a main in both GettingStarted and List. The IDE only recognizes the one in GettingStarted. I'm thinking this entire folder is considered one project, and you can only have one entrypoint in main. Is this right?\n I put extends App in List, and then I could run and debug things in List. I guess extending the main function from GettingStarted, I can then run the List file on its own.\n  \nCan someone explain to me how I should be thinking about files interacting with each other? In python I would use a __name__ == \"__main__\" to run code in each file. In C, I could write an int main() in each file and run each separately. But it seems in Scala it's very specific in terms of how def main() can appear.\n https://preview.redd.it/wynjw7x48myb1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=02fec652be47aa0e318d5a1ddbcbd7eaad81566e\n    submitted by    /u/maraskooknah  \n [link]   [comments]",

The general concept is to use existing projects to handle some of the details and make it easier to experiment with the unique features of the language. These ideas also try to avoid a lot of the standard web application implementation details that are usually covered in courses or books.\n ​\n  \nWrite a ui for hledger https://hledger.org/ . One already exists, but if you store the transactions as text blobs in a database and dump out hledger text files based on different things you want to do you could experiment with: \n Making projections by generating future transaction entries\n Running \"what if\" scenarios by filtering out past transactions and replacing them with generated transactions\n Different ways of tagging/categorizing/automating transactions \n \n Write a toy version of Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/ . Create a file format that describes a set of containers, read the file format, and use the shell `docker` (or `podman`) command to poll/start/stop the containers. You can experiment with different ways to start up different subsets of containers, ways of swapping different types of containers for different roles ...etc.\n Write a ui for MegaMek https://megamek.org/ . One already exists but mostly the idea is to use the existing game rules implementation and focus on experimenting with language features. Not sure how feasible this one is.\n Implement the ActivityPub protocol to create a Mastodon server.

Here are a couple of relevant questions in case anyone attending wants to ask: \n  \nTravis Brown and several Typelevel members have targeted individuals from minority groups as \"collateral damage\" in their disputes with JdG over the years. Considering the significant psychological distress this has caused on multiple occasions, and Travis' close association with Typelevel's leadership, will the steering committee address and condemn his cyberstalking tactics? Should the community be concerned about it happening again? \n \nOver the years, Typelevel's approach to cancellation campaigns has often been riddled by conflicts of interest, as targets were direct competitors. Are there plans to establish a more principled framework to govern such actions? Particularly when individuals from minority groups are involved, can the community expect decisions to be fair and thoroughly considered? \n \n    submitted by    /u/fwbrasil  \n [link]   [comments]",

He sells a Spark course, but in the FAQ, he doesn't recommend doing the Spark course if you haven't learned Scala. So I started with the Scala course. I'm finding the explanations to go superficially deep, and explaining a lot of concepts. I'm in the generics lesson right now, and I'm looking back at the older lessons, and I wouldn't be able to complete the exercises on my own after some time.\n Is there a better way? The best way for me in the past is to just come up with a project and start coding. My ultimate goal is to learn Spark well.

Even after someone asked him to add an image to his little demo and it took literally FIVE MINUTES and then he cant even format it or move it on the page.\n Every Youtube tutorial is the same - people typing and typing and tying for 20 minutes at a time to do what I can on my phone in literally 30 seconds. Endless Endless ENDLESS obscure shortcuts and menus inside menus beneath submenus - all with no intuitive or conceptual link to navigate between disconnected dumps of unformatted text.\n Even within a single page, theres never anything resembling a visual cue to explain what youre doing to what. And even when you do figure out what one peice of random highlighting means, you can't get anywhere without typing MORE obscure \"shortcuts\". HOW is this better than point and click? Who in their right mind would abandon ~30 years of interface progress for this demonstrably worse navigation method?\n I WOULD say it's the worst UX I've ever seen on any utility, ever - except there literally is not UX . All you end up with, everywhere, is a nigh-on-useless bricks of text, only clumsily navigated through with MORE STUPID SHORTCUTS . How anyone could be expected to manage anything with this is beyond all of us.\n Now he expects us to bring lesson summaries to the tute every week in this incomprehensible garbage, and literally NOBODY in the class has ANY idea how to organise anything in what as far as we can tell is just a glorified notepad, or why it even exits.\n What am I missing?\n EDIT: Well, from the look of the downvotes and cope in the comments, this is going to be one of THOSE \"open source\" communities.

I'm very much still a noob.\n One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I'm making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).\n For example, I'd write something like the below and need to type \"Big/Small Important Work Project\" a number of times with my big fat fingers:\n ``` ** Big Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project\n ** Small Important Work Project\n *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:\n *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project\n ``` (Note, I don't actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)\n In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone \n I therefore get tasks like \"call amit\" or \"book room\" a lot, devoid of context.\n Question:\n Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children?

I always go to see what is under `Task b...` only to find its empty.\n A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b \n The above code shows as:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Donut_7527  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, that doesn't seem to work on my machine.\n For example:\n ```\n +begin_src python :results value table\n import pandas as pd data = {'State':['CA', 'TX', 'FL'], 'Pop':[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) return df\n +end_src\n ```\n results in:\n ```\n +RESULTS:\n | State Pop | ```\n whereas I was expecting:\n ```\n +RESULTS:\n | | State | Pop | |---+-------+----------| | 0 | CA | 39029342 | | 1 | TX | 30029572 | | 2 | FL | 22244823 | ```\n In order to get the above, I currently have to use this hacky solution with the tabluate package:\n ```\n +begin_src python :results value raw :return tabulate(df, headers=df.columns, tablefmt='orgtbl')\n from tabulate import tabulate import pandas as pd data = {'State':['CA', 'TX', 'FL'], 'Pop':[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n +end_src\n ```\n which works as expected.

(I use org mode for practically everything in my note-taking, journaling and work tracking)\n I do, as the podcast describes, search for code snippets and pointers or ideas when prototyping code, sometimes it is content I can use right away or it can be something I just think is neat and possibly use in the future. But I don't have what I think is a great way of storing and retrieving this material.\n I use org-dailies every day for journaling and tag the posts for high-level topics, and org-roam for my comprehensive reading and research. But for programming journaling this really is me remembering to file the write-up (in org-daillies) at the end of the day or work on a project on that day, but it's not ideal for capturing quick text notes or excerpts from web pages etc. \n Are there good ways to track short snippet-like research detail and even auto-tag the entries with language, target project etc. in org mode? \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/redoakprof  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Help!\n I have recently transitioned to a custom workflow that relies on org-agenda to track progress on all the projects my team is working on. Overall, I'm very happy about it: I have a cron job that polls the jira server for updated tickets and refreshes a cache of org files, one per ticket. I wrote my Jira-org bridge and I render jira comments and changelog items one per org item with timestamps, and org-agenda does a fantastic job at showing me all updates, from the respective users. I can open any day and see very nicely what everybody in the team has done. I press capital E and I can even see excerpts of the comments they posted. So far, absolutely fantastic. It's literally better and faster than using the Atlassian tools in the web.\n Two things I don't like:\n (1) - all the org files are opened as individual buffers. It's hundreds of them. Low hundreds but still hundreds. I understand that org-agenda needs to index and reindex them, and also needs to \"remotely\" update their contents from the agenda view... but why keep them open in a buffer all the time? Can't org be configured to lazy open them only on a change?\n (2) - initial indexing is slow and will likely get slower every week. I don't mind it for now, because it's a price I only pay on a monday morning, and I can even hide it under the emacs server start that I do in crontab @ reboot... but I'm concerned about the long term sustainability of the solution. By nature, jira tickets will keep growing and growing over time. I only index the ones incurring active changes... but still. Is there a way to better control indexing costs? Is there a way to speed things up? Navigating from one week to another is starting to be a little slow. Yes this is hundreds of tickets and thousands of events, but in 2023 that's nothing in terms of data sizes contemporary software handles. Are there tricks to speed org-agenda up?\n    submitted by    /u/cazzipropri  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Aside from new language sources that the community can contribute at any time, this package feels more or less feature complete now.\n v1.0.0 on GitHub\n For those who don't know, treesit-auto enables automatic detection, installation, and usage of tree-sitter grammars and modes in Emacs 29+. Vanilla Emacs exposes some variables and functions that facilitate this behavior, but without treesit-auto it's up to you to check when tree-sitter is available and configure how Emacs behaves when it is (or isn't). This package takes that work away from you and is designed to fit what the vast majority of users would expect from automatic use of tree-sitter in Emacs.\n This started out as just my own configuration to treesit-language-source-alist, major-mode-remap-alist, and auto-mode-alist, but now has a lot of features that didn't exist just under a year ago when I first announced it.\n  \nAutomatic detection and installation for built-in tree-sitter modes, such as rust-ts-mode, yaml-ts-mode, toml-ts-mode, typescript-ts-mode, and go-ts-mode. You can get this behavior through the treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist function (the name is too long...I know)\n Less buggy behavior overall, such as ensuring we switch to the tree-sitter mode after installing it\n Detecting and installing grammars required by the current mode, such as TypeScript and TSX requiring each other\n  \nThis package isn't perfect. It's honestly still a bit of a hack, and many parts of the code are too clever for my own liking. It does its job, though, and I've been a happy, daily user of it for the last 9 months or so.

I'd like to drive emacs in the following way: mapcar over a list calling a function that opens a file, searches for a match, switches to interactive mode so I can adjust point, inserts some pre-formatted data specific to the match, allows me to edit the insertion to fix the inevitable typos that exist and, when I'm ready, saves the file and moves to the next element. I'm automating the file and buffer navigation as well as the content insertion but doing precise placement and editing by hand. Sadly, I did this once previously years ago but I don't remember how.\n Relevant rant: this stupidity's only necessary because yaml's flexibility for too many ways to do the same thing so reading the yaml in, adjusting the data structures and writing it back out make pull requests horrific as minute semantic changes can have massive syntactic ones.\n    submitted by    /u/fragbot2  \n [link]   [comments]",

In other org buffers the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t) whether under version control or not as global-diff-mode is enabled. For python files the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t ws-butler-after-save) as ws-butler-mode is enabled in the prog-mode-hook. What am I missing that could cause this behaviour?

It's fast, it's approachable, it's cross platform, and it's extremely capable even in preview beta. I never really got the swing of LaTeX with all the backslash/curlybrace mayhem. \n In any event, I find myself actually working on a long technical document in Typst in Emacs. There does exist typst-ts-mode so thanks tree-sitter and all those people who manage the grammar libraries for it. However I'm finding myself in need of a better way of navigating the huge document to get to sections I want to do.\n I looked into the baked-in bookmarks and I could probably use that capability, though I was hoping for more of an customizeable outline mode. Manually setting the bookmarks for an entire document seems tedious. I mainly just want to navigate by headings and that would be sufficient.\n What do people use for this sort of thing (possibly in the LaTeX world?) Just bookmarks with some sort of automated way of populating the bookmarks? I did check the typst-ts-mode and while there are some functions there for compiling, there don't seem to be any functions for navigating by semantic structures. Perhaps that's baked into tree-sitter itself?\n Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated here.\n    submitted by    /u/remillard  \n [link]   [comments]",

But often, when I want to go back, it seems to have \"forgotten\" them, jumps to a very old edit, and then displays \"No further change info\" in the minibuffer.\n I just had the problem again. I made sure the edits are very far away, many lines in the same org-buffer. Neither goto-last-change-reverse nor goto-last-change does find them. But when I use undo-redo, all my \"forgotten\" edits are found and subsequently undone. How can that be?\n Do you use a different function for going back to the last edits? Or am I using goto-last-change in a wrong way? The variable glc-default-span is set to 8, and I am using Org mode version 9.6.9 and Emacs 29.1.

I.e., I want to use a monospace font for all strings of the form \\(...\\) or \\[...\\], where ... may include newline characters as well, as is common for equations written in math display mode. \n I'm an Emacs newb, so the best I could come up with was a regex-based font-lock:\n (progn (setq-local font-lock-keywords `((,(rx (group (or \"\\\\[\" \"\\\\(\") (zero-or-more anything) (or \"\\\\]\" \"\\\\)\"))) (1 'fixed-pitch)))) (font-lock-fontify-buffer)) \n And then running this on an org-mode-hook.\n But this is definitely wrong. Not only does it remove all the nice org-mode styling applied to things like section headers, but it's also applying the fixed-pitch font to more than just the intended math fragments, suggesting issues with the regex at least.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Storage111  \n [link]   [comments]",

The experience has been great!\n One of the nice things that Forge did for me was showing the numbers of merge requests (in !123 form) in my magit-log views. Some time ago, however, this stopped working. Actually, this stopped working quite some time ago, maybe a year or more. I was too lazy to report it and too busy to investigate. IIRC it didn't stop working right away for all repos, so I guess it is not related to e.g. upgrading to Emacs 28 (and it was definitely before I upgraded to Emacs 29.1). \n To investigate this in more detail, I created new clones of several projects, but that didn't change anything. I also tried a simplified Emacs config in a new home directory to make sure that Forge's database was created from scratch. Same problem persists. \n On Forge's Github pages, I found some references to interactions of Forge with bug-reference-mode, so maybe it somehow has to do with that? On the other hand, given that I used a fresh Emacs config + new clones, I guess this isn't the cause of the issue either. \n Does anyone know how to get the MR numbers back in Magit's log view?\n    submitted by    /u/ph0t0nix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hej fellows,\n the title already is quite specific, so I'll just try to explain a bit more.\n I use `text-mode-hook` to activate `darkroom-mode` when I am in an org-mode buffer. This approach works quite alright, but I am struggling to make it work with another recent addition to my workflow, `desktop.el`.\n I want to use `desktop` to save opened files, window and tab bar configurations. After some tinkering this also works out fine, however, when I use `desktop-read` on a constellation that contains org-mode buffers, it seems like darkroom-mode is applied twice, i.e. the font is even bigger than with normal `darkroom-mode` applied.\n I have tried to use `desktop-after-read-hook` to re-initialize `darkroom-mode`:\n ```\n (defun or/re-initialize-darkroom ()\n (progn\n (darkroom-mode -1)\n (darkroom-mode +1)))\n ```\n However, this does not seem to work, because the text still is oversized. If it were only for one tab or buffer where this is the case, I'd swallow that pill. However, it is the case in all org buffers, which is a tad too annoying with four tabs containing four different org files.\n Thus, I'd love to hear about your experiences, maybe you've got a tip or two for me?\n Have a good day!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is my favorite terminal emulator of the bunch (yes even over vterm) and has actually improved my workflow. It does not need an external C library to be downloaded and in my opinion has the best keybindings of any terminal emulator I have tried. It has 3 main modes to cycle between:\n  \nInput Mode (C-c C-e) = similar to vterm's copy mode the buffer becomes \"frozen\" for you to copy the text and scroll back and basically use all of emacs's nifty search features.\n Char Mode (C-c M-d) = One of my favorite modes where basically every input you make short of the keys C-M-m or M-RET will be sent to the terminal. This means I can open vim/nano/emacs -nw all within the terminal buffer (which I do a lot as I ssh into machines regulary) and it works absolutely perfectly. \n Semi-Char Mode: The default mode where most inputs will be sent to the terminal. This mode does 90% of the job but if sometimes you have a weird mix of alt and control input combinations to send then the Char Mode is there for you.\n  \nJust wanted to bring more attention to this pacakage and would recommend others to try it a bit.\n Thank you /u/AkibAzmain for creating and maintaining this package.\n https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat\n    submitted by    /u/JoeKazama  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing I notice is that if I complete a word while the point is in the middle of a word it replaces the entire word including text after the point, unlike auto-complete.\n like if I have a line:\n `someFunction()`\n and I want to console.log it (in node) I would go to the beginning of the line and start typing\n `conssomeFunction()`\n Now if I select `console` as the completion, `someFunction` gets \"deleted\". This is weird behaviour since I think this is a common use case. Adding a space first is unintuitive to me and feels like an extra step.\n Is this configurable? Am I missing something?

This works well when I am cloning it in linux machines but when I clone it in windows machines, it doesn’t work.\n I have removed all the .elc files since those are not cross compatible but it still didn’t work and I realise that it’s because the generated autoload file is specified to be using unix style line endings (LF) but when I cloned it in the windows machine, the autoload files will have dos style line endings (CRLF) therefore causing the issue.\n Interestingly, the init file also uses CRLF and it still works presumably because it does not have the same specified coding as the generated autoload files.\n How should I get around this problem? I’m thinking of setting core.autocrlf to false on my windows machine. While that works, I will have to remember to create new files in my .emacs.d with only LF to keep the git repo clean and also presumably for it to work. I also thought about regenerating those autoloads after a clone but I’m not sure how to do so. Hence, I’m looking to see whether others have better solutions to this problem.\n Edit: I realise I can set core.autocrlf to input so that git will automatically convert any CRLF to LF on commit therefore resolving the issue.

          "description": "There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c \n Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under Task b... only to find its empty.\n A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b \n The above code shows as:\n * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b \n Any better solutions?\n    submitted by    /u/Desperate_Donut_7527  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm starting my journey on Vim and possibly Emacs (although, who am I kidding, seeing some of its capabilities it seems an inevitability). One thing that would accelerate my timeline to jumping into learning Emacs is if it handled a particular use case that is crucial to me.\n See, I do a lot of work in Jupyter Notebooks (Python) for school and ML/prototyping in general. One thing I like about notebooks is that if you make a mistake and the program fails, well, your intermediate calculations are still stored in memory and accessible. It's a graceful fail. If you fail through terminal, well, could be the end of what you calculated. \n The problem I have with Jupyter Notebooks is that they do not support parallel processing conveniently. I saw that Emacs has some interesting capabilities around notebook support; I believe org mode is what's used. \n I was interested in knowing if anyone uses Emacs as a way to get the best of both worlds: a way to run things using multiprocessing, but should things fail, it store the states in memory to rerun it.\n I appreciate any/all insight you have!\n    submitted by    /u/AnalystOrDeveloper  \n [link]   [comments]",

Furthermore, I learn Emacs for three years ago.\n But I struggle to achieve my learning of Elisp. For example, taping lisp and elisp code with evil/lispy is a true nightmare (I use Prelude with few modes, btw), not to mention when I type code block within org.\n I knew the learning curve is hard. But I didn't expect that much frustration to learn it. The documentation is austere. So few examples are given. There is too little blogs or books about Emacs, specifically about org and babel.\n To illustrate my point, let's take the *this* variable in babel, that I found TODAY by CHANCE in this page : https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html.\n It's a game changer for a lot of my code, and would deserve a whole page to illustrate it. But no, it's given in a «niche» example.\n Don't be mistaken, I found Babel/Org/Emacs wonderful, but what a pain in the ass to learn it !\n For such an old and wise piece of software, I can't understand why we don't have a smooth learning experience with Emacs. A lot of people could benefit Org/Emacs, without the big hinder of the «lack» of documentation (mostly examples).\n Am I the only one to experience this ?\n Edit : *this* is not a \"kind of macro\" but simply a variable.

It's basically line-by-line code execution to test algorithms and poke around things:\n\nThe top part is the actual script editing part and filled with a placeholder comment. Nothing to see there yet.\nSo here's a verified rumor -- the scripting language will be JavaScript by default. Reason for that is the excellent and secure environment Apple provides out of the box. (Other languages I would have preferred would require us to ship the language environment or depend on the user installing everything. So this is currently the only sane way to get started.
