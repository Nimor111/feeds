          "description": "Hi all -- I'm attempting to write a basic, type-directed program synthesis application using the ghc library. One issue I have run into is in comparing the types of arguments in polymorphic functions. \n I would like to be able to take a function of type, say, `Identity a -> b` and compare the first argument for equality with a known type `Identity a`. I would like to use the `eqType` function in GHC.Core.Type, but I don't know how to correctly separate the function type to do so.\n There are helper functions like `splitFunTy_maybe`, but that cannot be directly applied to my function type since it is wrapped in a `Forall` type constructor. My (very hacky) solution right now involves stripping the `Forall` constructor, splitting the bare function, then comparing the two types on their type constructors (in this case, `Identity`).\n I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this, because I'm having trouble extending my current solution to broader applications. Any help from ghc wizards would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/HydroxideOH-  \n [link]   [comments]",

In fact, I'm going to try the Advent of Code in it, as a forcing function.\n I'm trying to get a better handle on performance. For example, I really don't understand why the foldl' implementation in Data.List,\n  foldl' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b {-# INLINE foldl' #-} foldl' f z0 = \\ xs -> foldr (\\ (x::a) (k::b->b) -> oneShot (\\ (z::b) -> z `seq` k (f z x))) (id::b->b) xs z0 \n works so much better in GHCi than my naive implementation,\n  foldl' f !z [] = z foldl' f !z (x:xs) = foldl' f (f z x) xs \n Sure, that one is better than just using foldl or foldr, but it still takes about 2 s in GHCi or runghc to sum 1 to 10M. Compiled, it takes 0.2 s (reasonable), but plain-vanilla Python or Scheme (guile) only take about 0.5 s.\n The Data.List implementation takes about 0.5 s, much more in line with what I expect a reasonable interpreter to do, but I don't understand how it does it.\n Can someone walk me through it? I'd like to figure out how to make things run quickly in GHCi for while I'm going through Advent of Code problems. More generally, how should I think about performance?\n (And yes, I've read the comment in the code, but I didn't understand it.)\n Edit: In particular, if someone could help walk me through the comment in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/src/GHC.List.html#foldl%27, I'd appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/oddthink  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a MultiTree data structure, which looks like this:\n ```haskell\n data Node a = Node a a deriving stock (Functor, Show, Foldable, Traversable, Generic) type MultiTree b = FreeT Node [] (b)\n -- from the free package: -- newtype FreeT f m a = FreeT { runFreeT :: m (FreeF f a (FreeT f m a)) } -- data FreeF f a b = Pure a | Free (f b) ```\n Basically a multitree is a list of trees of lists of trees of... As an example:\n ```haskell\n trees :: MultiTree Text trees = FreeT [ Free (Node (FreeT [ Pure \"John\", Pure \"Mary\", Pure \"Andy\"]) (FreeT [ Pure \"runs\", Free (Node (FreeT [Pure \"eats\"]) (FreeT [Pure \"lettuce\", Pure \"garlic\"])) ]) ) ] ```\n Now what I'd like to do is to use the lens library to do a breadth first traversal trees ^.. cleverTraversal which gives [\"John eats lettuce\", \"Mary eats lettuce\", \"John eats garlic\", \"Mary eats garlic\", \"Andy eats lettuce\", \"Andy eats garlic\"].\n The reason I got inspired to do this with lenses is that I came across the plate and levels functions in lens, and those seemed like the right tools to, respectively, traverse recursively, and breadth first traverse. And FreeT has a Plated instance, so I was hoping it would all work magically.

It's fairly basic at the moment but I've already migrated a couple of projects to it, and it really is nice to have. Positive points:\n  \nYou have one source of truth regarding the supported compiler versions for your projects: your cabal file. \n No codegen is involved! You do not have to occasionally re-generate your CI file, which means that you can keep all the peculiarities and weird hacks you used to have. This tool only concerns itself with providing a list of OS and GHC versions. Some of which you can still exclude in the action file.\n  \nCoincidentally (or not), the next release of Flora will bring this stanza to the forefront (see associated announcement).\n Since the idea is to really be intertwined with the Haskell Github Action, the list of supported compiler is shared between this tool, the setup action and Flora.\n My thanks to David Christiansen for the idea of the CLI tool. The idea for it is to both disappear inside the future cabal status command, and that it becomes part of the official Haskell actions.\n    submitted by    /u/TechnoEmpress  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've found a lot of information, most of which seems to be like 10 years out-of-date. Depending on the year, the advice has ranged from \"definitely use mtl\" to \"definitely use transformers\" to \"it doesn't matter, they're basically the same thing\".\n So here's my noobed-up interpretation of the current situation, what I've managed to glean:\n mtl is (now?) built on top of transformers, so they are in that sense \"compatible\". However, mtl provides some \"extra stuff\".\n So my questions:\n  \nIs that basic summary more-or-less correct?\n ...and if so, what is the \"extra stuff\" that mtl provides? I've read the docs, a few wikis, and a whole pile of stack overflow threads, but still am not clear. (Some type classes, I think?) Practically speaking, why choose mtl over transformers?\n  \nI've only used transformers so far, but am not sure exactly what I'm missing.

          "description": "Hi,\n Not sure whether this should be handled at Scotty level or at Docker level, but my problem is the following:\n I've set up Docker and Nginx reverse proxy on a hosted Debian VPS. I'm successfully hosting multiple websites with SSL on this VPS, including an application built with Scotty.\n The app is basically just an editor in which you can write programs in a DSL I implemented. When you press \"Run\", the contents of the editor is sent to the backend as a POST request, and the program is evaluated server-side. The server then responds with the result.\n The problem arises in the fact that the DSL in question allows for infinite loops. Thus, when the backend evaluates the given program, it might not terminate. When this happens, the app is down for at least a minute seconds and the process consumes ~100% of the CPU on the server.\n Is there a reliable way (in my current Linux/Docker/Scotty stack) to automatically kill the process if it runs for more than, say, 8 seconds?\n What I've tried so far:\n  \nSetting a timeout of 8 seconds using scottyOpts\n Defining a health check in the Dockerfile that runs every 30 seconds\n  \nThe health check helps in the sense that it automatically restarts the container if the service does not respond, but this still yields significant downtime.\n Let me know if the post does not fit the sub.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/biografmeddem  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was a painful and long debate; I didn't post anything immediately after, but now that I think about it the debate eventually boiled down to, as I called it,\n A BROKEN PACKAGE IS BETTER THAN AN INSECURE PACKAGE. \n If Haskell cannot manage to (at least pretend to) successfully update a dynamic library dependency without recompilation and/or large-scale ad-hoc per-package manual patching and/or 100x performance penalty due to uneliminated indirection, then it's Haskell's fault for doing so. Packages in other languages can get broken by security patches as well; it's just that they often (at least pretend to) work and Haskell breaks too often.\n I never realized that security patches are his first and foremost concern since he never seemed to have expressed that explicitly regarding this issue.

At this point, I am surprised when it doesn't optimize like this. \n I never did see is kind of performance in Haskell. Despite my best efforts, when I rewrite in Haskell, it rarely gets any faster than 0.1x to 0.3x the speed of the Rust equivalent. When you need the speed and not just the language niceties, this is depressing.\n Does Haskell/GHC have a chance at hitting this kind of performance?

          "description": "I've just seen the post related to the new release of Fourmolu and thought I have a look into it. \n Unfortunately, it doesn't fit my style. However it reminded me that formatters existed (so far, I've been formatting everything manually for years) and it might be time to finally adopt one. I started investigating and the result is, they are plenty (too many ?), some which might be deprecated and none of them correspond to my style (I think).\n I mean I think because most of them are configurable and it may be possible that one with the correct configuration will fit. So my question is ; is there any formatter which will fit the following requirements (or the closest, I am even ready to modify it if needed).\n I'm pretty much only require list be aligned on (leading comma), but I don't want the formatter to add new line for me after an =. so\n myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] \n (my prefered way) or \n  myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] \n If I have myself started [ 1 on the new line.\n function call like this (when too long)\n function arg1 ( other_function x y ) arg3 \n I do record like this (or equivalent)\n MyRecord = MyRecord { x :: Float , y :: Float } \n But the most peculiar thing I do is have a trailing let, ie\n my function a = let x = a+1 y = a+10 in x*y \n and I can't find any formatter allowing it. I'm surprised nobody is doing it because it works really well. It's compact : save one line and one level of indentation and neat to read.\n The rest, I don't really care , I don't need import to be sorted or case to be aligned etc . In fact I just need the level of indentation to be correct : children of things (list element, argument, etc eee) all with the same identation, but first children inline with the parent.\n    submitted by    /u/maxigit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In this post I asked how a literal 1 gets interpreted as of type Num a => a. The answer was 1 is actually fromInteger 1, i.e., Haskell auto-magically considers naked 1 to be function call fromInteger 1. And since fromInteger is a method in Num etc., etc. Likewise 3.14 is actually fromRational 3.14 and so, likewise, the class system is invoked. But the types of fromInteger and fromRational are fromInteger :: Num a => Integer -> a and fromRational :: Fractional a => Rational -> a . But then ((fromInteger 1) + (fromRational 3.14)) :: Fractional a => a , which means the 1 got routed through Integer by fromInteger into playing well with Rational, deferring to Rational. How is this happening? The invocation of a class' various type instances is understood -- once a hint is given, i.e.,\n λ> :t (1 :: Int) (1 :: Int) :: Int \n but this won't work\n λ> (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) <interactive>:124:19-34: error: • Couldn't match type ‘Ratio Integer’ with ‘Integer’ Expected: Integer Actual: Rational • In the second argument of ‘(+)’, namely ‘(3.14 :: Rational)’ In the expression: (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) In an equation for ‘it’: it = (1 :: Integer) + (3.14 :: Rational) \n Once again, the hint-free, naked literals are playing nice with each other. And yes, if Haskell is subbing in fromInteger 1 for 1 and fromRational 3.14 for 3.14 then yes, the whole class system is involved. But how is this managed? Examples I've seen so far are helped by relying on type inference hints to route things to the proper from*. But naked literals, then adding \"unlike\" naked literals is a type inference that goes deeper than I can fathom. It's leveraging the class world like I can't figure out but would really like to know. It reminds of functors maybe?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

The simplest form of it can be phrased in terms of functions of type Bool -> Bool -> ... -> Bool.\n Consider for example the function f x y z = (y && z) || x. Suppose I want to prove the property that \"if x is True, then the value of f x y z is independent of y and z\". In other words, \"f True is a constant function\".\n My idea for proving this property is to extend the Bool types to a kind of 3-valued logic similar to Maybe Bool, but with different semantics. You could call it, say, data Partial a = Actual a | Unknown. The semantics of Unknown follow the truth table e.g. at this Wiki link.

          "description": "First of all sorry for a long question that probably has an obvious and short answer.\n I'm working through the idea that you can get to the Comonad typeclass, and its NonEmptyList instance, just by roughly considering the analogy between a category of CoKleisli arrows and turning it into code. In other words extract is extract :: w a -> a and compose is compose :: (w a -> b) -> (w b -> c) -> (w a -> c). Now you can rearrange to get extract and duplicate, and add Functor's fmap.\n What I'm having a hard time with is that to implement compose for NonEmptyList is that if you start with a w a you can apply the first CoKleisli to get the b, but to get a w b to plug in to the next function you need to sort of conjure duplicate from thin air. Once you have duplicate you can go ahead and implement the NonEmptyList Comonad we are all familiar with, which \"duplicates\" the incoming list to its list of itself and its tails.\n The question is, isn't there a simpler, but trivial and uninteresting implementation of compose here (and hence for extend also) that instead of duplicate, simply takes the head of the NonEmptyList. As far as I can tell this implementation is also lawful as a Comonad. I am missing a satisfying way to express that the way duplicate is implemented is somehow \"the right and obvious way\".\n    submitted by    /u/justinhj  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am tied to my current location for the forseeable future. \n As a result of the above, I worry about a scenario where I would end up losing my job at some point down the road and not being able to carry my experience onto my next job as easily. Is this justified or would it not be difficult to make a switch if need be? I notice vacancies often require several years of experience in whatever programming language the company offering the job is using. My qualifications are solid for my age and I have had the opportunity to contribute to open source projects as well so I guess that might help me in such a scenario. Maybe I should look to contribute to some non-FP open source projects just in case?\n In short, the dilemma I am in is that I do not want to quit my FP job but at the same time I do not want to potentially end up in a bad spot career-wise.\n I figured it could help to have some perspective from other people about this matter and would love to hear your thoughts on it.\n    submitted by    /u/Tight_Resist_7614  \n [link]   [comments]",

Errors from each stage should be accumulated into the \"final list of errors\", and a validation stage should only run on data that was successfully validated by the previous stage. In other words: each stage should return a list of validation errors along with the data that passed the validations of that stage. In addition most stages require IO to pull some data needed for the actual validation.

Because while in theory the concept sounds awesome, I don't get the way it was implemented. And I was already close to filing a bug report for this issue that then turned out to be \"intended behavior\".\n  \nThe other day I ran into the situation that I had two type aliases that both mapped to Lists of something. Then I wanted to implement an extension method on both of these types with the same signature.  type A = List[Int] type B = List[String] extension (a: A) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? } extension (b: B) { def doSomething: Unit = ??? }  But the compiler refused to do that because of the methods being identical after type erasure. Okay, I get that.\n But before I proceed with the core story here,…",

          "description": "If you're wondering why, well, just to reduce my dependency cone and possibly build times. No deeper reasons.\n Replaced sbt-assembly with sbt-native-packager's dist command to build a zip file. Unzipped that. Then added the resulting directory into my Docker image. The image now has everything needed to run the app, no fat JAR required.\n Replacing sbt-buildinfo was slightly trickier. I decided to roll the replacement by hand and 'sacrifice' a couple of things that sbt-buildinfo provides. Let's cover all of them:\n  \nname: I can just hard-code the project name, it's not like it's going to change all the time\n version: just need to plug in the output of git describe here\n scalaVersion: do I really need this info in my health page? Not really. I can just look up the version, pull up my repo, and figure out the Scala version there\n sbtVersion: same argument, I don't really need this in my app's health page\n buildTime: just need to plug in the output of date -u -Iseconds here (e.g. 2022-11-25T03:11:49+00:00)\n startTime: bonus, sbt-buildinfo doesn't provide this but it's trivial to add, just run val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString eagerly when the app starts up.\n  \nOK, so above in a couple of places I mention plugging in the output of shell commands, how to do that? Pretty simple. In the project code we just have a file like this committed in the repo:\n // Info.scala package build object Info { val name = \"my-app-name\" val version = \"TBD\" val buildTime = \"TBD\" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } \n And at build time we just replace this file with a generated one:\n # build.sh printf ' package build object Info { val name = \"my-app-name\" val version = \"%s\" val buildTime = \"%s\" val startTime = java.time.Instant.now.toString } ' \"$(git describe)\" \"$(date -u -Iseconds)\" sbt test dist unzip target/.../my-app-name.zip \n Yes, that's printf in Unix shell.

It has nothing to do with Elon Musk's takeover, actually, as I've been feeling like this for some time, drastically limiting its use. For me, Twitter is like that family dinner where the conversation is monopolized by your uncle's political views, and you're compelled to listen, just because he has a strong voice, he's family and can't tell him to shut up.\n You can choose to stay on Twitter, who knows, I might return in the future, too 🤷‍♂️ but right now it's no longer a healthy environment for a programming community. It's due to all the noise, as outrage generates attention, and outrage is encouraged by Twitter's features. Even when speaking of programming, I don't want inflammatory tweets in my feed, from some ignorant fool, advising Elon to rewrite the whole thing in Go, alongside all the reactions to it. And I'm sure that many Twitter users can agree that engagement has gone off a cliff lately for anything that's not related to politics.\n Some of us are trying out Mastodon. As a full disclosure, out of my Twitter followers, I could find about 4% of them on Mastodon, so around 200 people, some of them inactive. But for me that's enough, plus I found interesting people from other adjacent communities.\n Mastodon may prove to be counterproductive, too, as it's another social network, and maybe there's something wrong with social networks in general. But I like that it has that original web 1.0 vibe to it, and that it is “federated”, like email. Maybe you'd like to try it out, too.\n  \nI added some notes on how to migrate from Twitter, maybe you'll find it useful:\n alexn.org/wiki/mastodon/\n This is not a call to arms 🙂 it's just a suggestion, as I'd love to see more of you there.\n Cheers 🤗\n    submitted by    /u/alexelcu  \n [link]   [comments]",

To be noted is that those won't cover the most basic concepts such as the inline keyword, expressions, transparent etc. since these can be understood from the documentation and many other posts.\n I will try to add more guides on use cases I found perfect for macros to showcase the potential of Scala's compile-time system.

I've already considered sticking it in something like cloud run or a plain old VM using free tier, but I'm hoping there might be some lower maintenance and more magical - ideally a java flavoured Vercel or thereabouts? 😉 \n The app currently hosts a Graphql api and also performs polling of an event stream (event sourcing), so I don't think a 'cold start' option would be viable unless I rework the polling and perform the work in-line trigger based 🤔 \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/absolutejam  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello dear Scala community !\n I have a very dumb ( or not, I am not sure ) question.\n Recently at work we kinda started a debate on how to handle errors in our applications : we use tapir + http4s and cats-effect's IO everywhere and current urrent practice is to throw everything in the IO's error channel and eventually catch it somewhere upstream. \n But by switching to mainly using http4s clients to sttp clients to communi6between our services we often find our business logic kinda sandwiched between a source of data producing IO[Either[E,A]] and an API description which expects the same.\n Lifting everything into the IO error channel to caste it again into the same input shape seems to be a waste of information and effort, while also not getting any help from the compiler to handle those errors. This kinda leads me to lean toward using EitherTs....which is metwith some resistance as it does tend to add some complexity to the code.\n In this context I found out about this wonderful article https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/functional-error-handling/ which seemed to reflect exactly my own...erm...reflexions. After reading it, I thought I found the perfect middle ground ! Put errors not in the output type of your functions, but give it the capability to fail thru MonadError from cats and Raise from cats-mtl. Maybe lift everything into a neat context function type an bam everyone is happy.\n I started experimenting. Everything was very neat and tidy until....and here comes my dumb question....where do I get MonadError and Raise instances for IO ? Is there another lib ?\n I found tofu which seems to cover pretty much anything I need but they don't publish for scala 3. Do I have to rewrite both for the IO monad ?\n    submitted by    /u/WiIzaaa  \n [link]   [comments]",

It might not be a big deal, but when I start off with a clean slate, I like to run the newest of the new to be able to take full advantage of the latest features, should I feel like it.\n What's the \"correct\" way of changing the JVM version used by Scala, so I can use the latest version? Do I manually download and install the JDK of choice? Can one of the CLI tools do it for me, like NVM (Node Version Manager) for node?\n Thank you for your time!\n Edit: Understandably, when I didn't specify it, it's easy to assume I'm on linux, but I'm on Windows 11!

Or maybe have some pointers as to how to do it differently? (I considered the DTO just being a class composing the task and comment list as fields, but that feels wonky)\n    submitted by    /u/Lumintorious  \n [link]   [comments]",

For exemple, if you would like to do the following: chat with someone who doesn't know org-mode well, via org-mode.\n That is, he would just have to call commands like \"reply to this message\", where each message could be a heading, and each file a topic of discussion. The files would be in a folder that would be shared. This would largely mirror the layout of reddit replies. \n Edit and precision : a person A would not have to be logged in to receive B's message, just like on reddit or any other modern communication medium.\n ​\n Also, the power of org-mode could be used: combined with org-babel, org-attach, org-roam etc... that would be really cool.\n ​\n Is there a package to do this? If so which one? If not, would someone like to do it with me? Is it a good idea to make a package or is there an easier way?\n    submitted by    /u/Cletip  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I wanted to see if there was anything I'd be missing before I do that. The only things I can think of are\n  \nAesthetics while editing - yes you can export with org in a pretty format of your choosing, but it seems like you don't have quite as much control over aesthetics while writing. I don't really care too much about this, just something I've noted\n Line wrapping in table fields - in Notion I make heavy use 2 column tables that have tens of rows, and line wrapping works seamlessly. It seems like org tables don't really support line wrapping. I read about a few possible solutions but they seem a bit like they are going against the grain. This is probably the biggest holdup that might stop me from transitioning\n  \nIs there anything else I'm missing?

ExecuteOnTerminal(type) range if (&ft=='bash' || &ft=='sh') if a:type == \"V\" :vert botright '<,'> %terminal bash else :vert botright %terminal bash endif elseif (&ft=='python') if a:type == \"V\" :vert botright '<,'> %terminal python3 else :vert botright %terminal python3 endif elseif (&ft=='awk') if a:type == \"V\" '<,'>w! /tmp/file.awk else :w! /tmp/file.awk endif :vert botright terminal awk -f /tmp/file.awk /home/user/sampleFile endif endfunction\n vnoremap <silent> <F10> :call ExecuteOnTerminal(\"V\")<CR> nnoremap <silent> <F10> :call ExecuteOnTerminal(\"I\")<CR> ```\n Basically, it detects if I'm selecting lines or not. If I press F10, it'll execute the selected lines or the entire file depending on the type of the file. I'd like to create a similar function on emacs. I know that for that I'd need:\n  \nA function that detects the language of the file like &ft does on vimscript.\n A way of detecting if I'm selecting lines or not on the current file and getting the content of it.\n Something like the terminal command from vim, it executes the code on a split window.\n  \nI'd like to create my own personalized function because I end up having more control of what's happening, like the last elseif that I'm executing awk code with the data of a hardcoded file. This way I can handle multiple types of files with a single shortcut... But I'm having trouble finding equivalent elisp functions for the three points that I've listed here. Can anyone help me on that?

When I open a project and my lsp server starts with pyright, the file I first opened to open the project doesn't work well. I don't get the usual autocompletion, the errors listed by flycheck all appear in the first in the first lines and don't get removed if i correct the acutal error, ....\n And this only happens in the very first file which started the server ! On top of that I've also noticed that it only happens when I have more than one listed lsp workspace folder using pyright.\n My current workaround is to kill the buffer and reopen the file again but it would beetter if I could get rid of it entirely.\n I use doom emacs with pyright and lsp and I also use pyenv for my virtualenvs with the pyenv package which allows emacs to automatically detect the local version I set for a project and use it. \n It's very weird and I have a hard time finding the root of the problem so if someone had a similar issue at some point or as any clue on what to do it would be very much appreciated !\n    submitted by    /u/TheHentaiSama  \n [link]   [comments]",

My ultimate goal is to perform tree-manipulations via structural editing and macroexpansion of lisp forms, where after the manipulation, I am left with a lisp form that evaluates to something useful.

This leads to write things like (eval \\(match`\n ,sub-pattern ,sub-form)) inside the macro. This feels like an\n ugly hack, but the alternative would be to use functions and\n quote\n every input, leading to (match \\(quote ,sub-pattern) `(quote`\n ,sub-form)) .

Then straight-thaw-versions applies whatever versions are in there to the package repos.\n  \nI think I also saw a :ref option in an answer here on reddit but I can't find the either the :ref and :tag option in the straight README. There is a :branch option though and that is the one I want to stick to, but it may not be safe if changes or some fixes which I may not want are backported to it.\n My idea then is to clone the repo I want, create a branch from the commit hash I want and point straight to it. If I don't make any changes to it than that \"branch\" will be good with straight forever, and I should be able to use the :fork option if I want to retain a reference to the original configuration.\n Is this cloning and creating an unchanging branch a good idea?

For instance, ibuffer is not listed there, but it is a package, and it is installed (I can see ibuffer.el.gz and ibuffer.elc in /usr/share/emacs/28.2/lisp/). Is there a way to see a complete list of packages?

Currently, I switch to the other window with ace-window o (C-x o in my case) then mazimize that one with zoom-window-zoom (bound to z in my case). The nice thing with zoom-window-zoom is that it toggles... so z again unmazimizes the window. Then I C-x o again to get back to the first window. So, to fill my screen with the other window: C-x o, z, z, C-x o. Muscle memory at this point. But I want to be able to hit one key and maximize the other window, and hit it again to unmaximize the other window, and have my pointer where it was in the first window at the end.

So now I like to build a function in emacs-lisp to execute the code blocks in the org mode file to automatically generate the tables when you call it, but I'm very new to emacs-lisp and don't know where to start. Any suggestions for that? . \n Is there a package that does something similar?\n https://preview.redd.it/26l7blnykr0a1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=2193c8397719cb6d9206dd20d4fc79ebbaad5215\n    submitted by    /u/GidiomGates  \n [link]   [comments]",

There doesn't seem to be any caching of steps between escaping.\n Example:\n  \nWrite code and an explanation below.\n I mark the code to copy it, but when I hit \"y\" there is only this little y where the code once was. Forgot to escape.\n When I now use undo, the whole text resets to an almost ancient state, sometimes from 10-30 minutes ago.\n So I have to redo-undo.\n Now I'm still stuck with the y instead of the code and I have two options: \n Type all again from the ancient state.\n Type the code again, I accidentally deleted by pressing y without escaping first.\n \n  \nIs there any way I can prevent this time-consuming mess? It can't be that everyone who works with Emacs constantly loses text / code and hours of work. So the fault must be on my side.\n I read through the undo chapter of Emacs and a few threads here in Emacs on reddit. (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html).

For example, I was trying to figure out how to call a function that could create a new org entry from an org template, with certain values passed in as parameters. I kept running into a wall, until I realized that I needed to set a global variable to a plist containing the values, and then access those values using elisp in the template. This would be a sure sign that someone doesn’t know what the hell they’re doing in any other language I know of, but it seems to just be how things work in the EMacs/elisp world. I can only imagine how bad my code would be if I learned by hacking on EMacs…. \n Is this just a function of EMacs being an older system that was developed before more best practices were developed?

On occasion, though, I'll need to move to a specific line number (for example, if reading about a line from documentation or an error buffer). In those situations, I want to see all the absolute line numbers. My solution has been:\n (advice-add 'goto-line-read-args :before (lambda () (setq display-line-numbers 'absolute))) (advice-add 'goto-line :after (lambda (_LINE &optional _BUFFER _RELATIVE) (setq display-line-numbers 'relative))) \n This works perfectly. However, some times I change my mind after calling goto-line, and decide to do something else instead. When I quit out of goto-line (C-g), the second advice doesn't get run and I'm stuck with absolute line numbers. Obviously it's not much of a pain to set them back to relative, but I'm wondering if there's a way to do it automatically.\n I'm also asking because I'm trying to get more familiar with how the advising functionality works, and I'd like to understand if there's a way to get out the quit issue. It seems to me that sometimes there are advices that need to run, even if the function has been quit.

          "description": "Howdy! I originally posted this question on r/linux, and it was suggested to post it here as well.\n I'm installing Gentoo, and I'm looking at either StumpWM or EXWM as a WM, and I'm leaning toward EXWM simply because Emacs. However, I'm sure there's a lot I don't know about the comparison between them. I'm wondering if you nice folks might share your insights.\n I use Emacs a lot, and plan on using it more and more as I get my config dialed in. I'm fully invested in Emacs, and consider it to be part of the OS, so I'll be using it either way. I think having more stuff in Emacs is nothing but handy. I will be using this setup on several PCs, including a crappy laptop, a gaming laptop, and a few desktops. Gaming is the main thing I'm worried about. I just use KDE on the gaming laptop for now.\n I'm also interested in programming, specifically in Lisp. I'm leaning more toward Common Lisp, which is what StumpWM is written in. Of course EXWM is Emacs Lisp, but that's kind of Emacs-specific and wouldn't be used for other software development. I've also considered learning scheme because I have a copy of SICP, but that's taters under the skillet.\n Finally, I'm a few months away from getting going on managing a homelab. None of the servers will run this system, but all of the management will be done through it on my main PC. I will be doing a lot of multitasking, troubleshooting, remote-management, security stuff, note-taking, etc.\n So, in a nutshell, I'm wondering: - What can StumpWM do that EXWM can't do? - What can EXWM do that StumpWM can't do? - What are the major limitations of each, specifically when compared to one another? - How will each compare when stacked against the things I want to use it for? - How does the ecosystem for each one compare? I know the Emacs ecosystem decently well, but not StumpWM's. Are there many plugins / extensions? Are there many users communicating regularly with each other?\n    submitted by    /u/Tristan401  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My use of org roam is pretty basic. The last couple months I was just using a journal, as the easist thing to do to build up some note taking muscle. The trouble with this is that for a given project, say, the notes for it are spread all over the file, I want to bring them together. Enter org roam.\n I have a file per entity (person, project, journal, interview) and most entries are dated. Each week I like to review whats gone on and write up some conclusions, using the journal this was easy, but now not so much.\n Is there a way to search my org dir, for a date range (last week), and pull together all of the matching nodes, and display them with the title and file tags from the orignal files? Been reading about consult this morning, and that sounds like a possible route, but figure I'd ask for some guidance. \n I guess I could go the other way, just use a journal and tag each node, and pull together the entity nodes adhoc, but that would rely on being very consistent with tags, which seems more error prone to me. Happy for any tips if others go this route.\n    submitted by    /u/mudrainrocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, first post here. I have been a happy emacs user since I knew about its existence and now I'm a even happier user of org. My question is about org's indent mode and custom themes. Apparently, org's indent mode creates the illusion of indentation by inserting dummy '*'s at the beginning of each sub-header, and making them invisible. When I switch custom themes, most themes do not consistently set colours in such a way that those dummy stars are invisible, that is, I guess, have the background colour. I am aware that custom themes cannot be undone by design, however, as a matter of fact, some themes do work consistently correctly with respect to indent mode, notably, all sanityinc's ones. Is it feasible to isolate the relevant feature of sanityinc's themes and replicate it in other themes to fix them?\n    submitted by    /u/eskran  \n [link]   [comments]",

In recent times i've been trying to do some code cleanup, but to say that there are 'infelicities' - both within the code itself, and in terms of the UX - is an understatement.\n At one point i started doing some work to move to a parser based on the grammars defined in the three vCard specs (2.1, 3.0, 4.0, with differences between them significant enough to make trying to deal with them Less Than Fun), but that didn't get particularly far.\n i'd also toyed with creating an ELisp CardDAV library and refactoring org-vcard to make use of that, but that never eventuated either. (Partly, if i recall correctly, because when i first looked into doing this, there was a bug in Emacs' XML parsing; it got fixed, but the fix took a while to appear in an Emacs release.)\n If anyone is interested in taking maintainership, please contact me (Alexis) at the email address listed in the project repo.\n    submitted by    /u/flexibeast  \n [link]   [comments]",

Three dashed lines (e.g., \"---\") marks the beginning of a new slide. At every occurrence of these three dashed lines, I want to display the slide number. So the buffer will look like this:\n ```\n  \nHeader for first slide\n content\n  \nHeader for second slide\n  \nHeader for third slide\n ```\n And what I want the the buffer to look like this:\n ```\n --- Slide 1\n Header for first slide\n content\n --- Slide 2\n Header for second slide\n --- Slide 3\n Header for third slide\n ```\n So after I type \"---\" with a line break, it will add the slide number. The trick is that I can't actually insert the text though because in order for xaringan to properly break slides, there cannot be anything after the three dashes, not even a line break.\n How can I do this?

If so, I have two questions:\n  \nExactly how does the \"but only if\" in my point #2 above work? I assume that if the which osascript fails, then the call to osascript -e never happens. But how is that done? Something to do with the && I presume?\n Why is the script author making only the call to oasscript -e conditional on a successful which osascript? Why don't they also gate the emacsclient line itself? (In other words why don't just they kill the whole script if the which fails?) I might have understood letting the emacsclient line still run, even if the which had failed, but only if the author had included a -a option for emacsclient. Then, even if the failed which did blocked the call to oascript -e which in turn meant there would be no Emacs launched (and so no call to start-server), still emacsclient could have launched the alternate editor it had been given using -a. But as it stands, it looks like emacsclient will still valiantly attempt to launch even though it is almost certainly doomed to failure through lack of an emacs server.\n  \n???\n    submitted by    /u/TeeMcBee  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand that Emacs is self-documenting and that the Info system is very comprehensive, so I always try to use Emacs and Info to search for answers before resorting to a web search. However I sometimes find it quite difficult to find what I need which makes me feel like I'm missing something.\n I was reading the Emacs development mailing list this morning and came across messages about \"EUDC\", but I didn't know what that was. So I hit C-h i to run info.\n I first tried m to select a manual, but EUDC did not appear in this list. I assumed that it would be part of the Emacs manual, so I tried to select \"Emacs\" from this list but that too did not appear. I closed info and instead hit C-h r to run info-emacs-manual and I then searched through the list from m for EUDC but found nothing. I then tried i (Info-index) but again EUDC did not appear in the list.\n I then tried a (info-apropos) but again nothing was found for \"EUDC\". Finally I got somewhere with s (Info-search); this took me to a page \"33.4.2 Mail Header Editing\" which had a comment about EUDC at the very bottom. There finally I saw the text \"see EUDC (eudc)\" which was a link to the correct \"Emacs Unified Directory Client\" info page.\n As you can see, my method for finding the correct Info manual was far from optimal. My question therefore is, what is the correct way of finding manuals like this using Info in Emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/polaris64  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm working a lot with Kubernetes and because of the nature of it - a lot of YAML files.\n These files usually end being a YAML file with Go or helm templates, which totally breaks parsing of said file for with Flycheck. I do appreciate all the YAML structure hints and usual errors which Flycheck would catch - but I can't figure out a way how to stop whole buffer from highlighting if YAML file contains some go template logic - or similar. I'd say the same would be true if i.e. the file would be an ERB template of said YAML.\n For context, I'm using doom-emacs, although not sure if that matters, I'd be happy to configure this even manually if needed.\n    submitted by    /u/zeroDivisible  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe more customization, better performance? Or is there maybe some kind of inherent disadvantage to Doom?\n Also if anyone has any good resources on how to configure doom extensively please share them it would be appreciated :) \n Edit: Thank you all for your feedback and clarifications, while reading through some emacs documentation I came along Chemacs and I will take the advice to watch the emacs from scratch series whilst being able to have my regular doom emacs setup on the side while working on my base emacs setup.\n    submitted by    /u/spilmad  \n [link]   [comments]",

Same when I visit elisp files, python files, .. pretty much everything. \n However in my generated *text* buffer and the *scratch* buffer there is no indicator. \n When I run emacs -nw or plain emacs works as expected and both those buffers have the indicator. \n With emacs-client though, in those buffers, the global-minor-modes does include global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode but local-minor-modes does not include display-fill-column-indicator-mode. \n In contrast I also have \n (use-package display-line-numbers :ensure nil :hook ((text-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode) (prog-mode-hook . display-line-numbers-mode))) \n And indeed display-line-numbers-mode is active in both the *scratch* buffer and my own *text* despite not setting those hooks until after the *text* buffer even using emacs-client. \n How can I get this behaviour in all buffers?\n    submitted by    /u/bhrgunatha  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do `customize-face` and set background to black, but it does not become black. It looks like the theme continues to override my customisation.

When I set the governor to 'balance power' or 'performance', the sensitivity of clocks to load improves - CPU clocks peak at 2.7 Ghz, the base clock, for the duration of the scroll - and the scrolling becomes smooth.\n I don't know whether anyone else has experienced this and I'd like some tips on where I should post this to attract attention from developers. It's not ideal that scrolling is so CPU intensive in the first place. Very grateful though, of course, for pixel-scroll-precision-mode!\n    submitted by    /u/LukeFL  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have used the same functions as the hydra in the link. Namely these:\n  (defun hydra-move-splitter-left (arg) \"Move window splitter left.\" (interactive \"p\") (if (let ((windmove-wrap-around)) (windmove-find-other-window 'right)) (shrink-window-horizontally arg) (enlarge-window-horizontally arg))) \n The resizing more often then not fails however, because the transient window in and on itself is fixed-size and does allow neither explicit, nor implicit resizing.

In addition, it reduces the GC pressure because some of the objects never reach the lisp layer. Compile it just like a normal emacs(make sure to have --with-modules configuration flag) and it should work with the latest and greatest lsp-mode. \n The code is still not extensively tested and works only for Linux/Unix.

Tree Sitter is an interesting potential replacement and I got it working with some languages but I got lost trying to install a language manually - ex vue tree sitter.\n Indentation can be unexpected. For example, say you are a PHP developer and you decide to try Emacs. The first thing you'd do is install some sort of PHP support, right? So you'd likely go to php-mode.\n  \nThis is how php-mode highlights and indents my code by default.\n On VS Code, here is how it indents and formats the same code almost out of the box. Just had to install the PHP formatter. Just works.\n So then on your Emacs PHP journey you'd try to look for a better mode so you'd install web-mode and be happy because it formats it as expected. But I've experienced situations where web-mode would format in an unexpected way or syntax highlighting bugs out so I'd have to re-run M-x web-mode.\n  \nI seem to experience this a lot. A language mode that's just has the janky kind of feel. I also wish there was more of a standard in how things were done. As an example, several language modes define their own variable for tab width. I do understand this is a project that's been around since the 80s so cruft is to be expected.\n    submitted by    /u/PrayForGains  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I am thinking about making a set of foot pedals for Emacs. I've looked into it before and I know different people used them differently but the impression I got was that your feet are too slow and too desynced from your hands to make it worthwhile (at least without significant practice). \n My motivation stems from my left hand getting pretty overloaded, making some sequences of C and M impractical. For example, I struggle with using binds like C-c <any key> because I tend to hold down the control while I press the next letter, so I get C-c C-<that key>. \n So my idea would be to have pedals for priming the next keystroke to have a C or an M. So I can press the Cpedal, then hit c <any key> and get C-c key. The pedal would then need to be released in order to register another C. There would be one pedal for C and one for M. \n I was wondering if anybody had any experience with foot pedals and how useful (or useless) they were in your workflow. Have you ever used footpedals? If so, what did you use them for in Emacs? Did you have any use for them outside of Emacs? Were they comfortable? \n Anything helps!\n    submitted by    /u/_ianna  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem came from the auto-formatting occasionally throwing spaces on a line in a way that made the interpreter freak out.\n I couldn't find a solution, so I came up with this:\n lisp (add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook (function (lambda () (replace-regexp-in-region \"\\s+\\n\" \"\\n\" (org-element-property :begin (org-element-at-point)) (org-element-property :end (org-element-at-point))) nil))) \n It chomps spaces at the end of lines which fully eliminates them from the lines that were causing problems.

I'm okay with both those things)\n I did a write up with more details and notes\n It took me a straight 8 hours to come up with the solution.

          "description": "So I've been using Gnu Emacs in the office for about two weeks now. I'm a vim user and will remain a vim user but I was challenged to try emacs by my colleagues and I in turn challenged them to try Vim. After the promised two weeks I can say the following about emacs from a vimmer perspective.\n I actually LIKE IT. I like the possibilities of emacs and the extensibility although for my workflow it doesn't offer much that vim plugins don't.\n  \nI don't like emacs PACKAGE MANAGER at all and I don't really care for lisps. I find vim script much easier. I don't like how emacs treats buffers and I find myself constantly killing extra buffers. I don't mind the emacs key bindings that much but I quickly changed the evil mode because muscle memory was killing me. \n  \nI both LOVE & HATE M-x commands! I love them cause you can discover so much about was emacs can do but I hate typing them. I REALLY like w3m in emacs! I use w3m in a terminal on a daily basis and with emacs I can just have it open in a buffer or split and do my work at the same time. \n  \nI LOVE how great emacs handles RTL languages. It is just great and looks great too.\n  \nI don't care for org mode! Yea yea I know you will hate me for saying it but I really dont care about it I prefer Vim wiki\n  \nI DON'T like the emacs terminal options that I've tested so far. K couldn't install vterm so maybe thats why\n  \nWith all that being said I will use both emacs and vim on a daily basis for different things but what would make my life easier in emacs would be if I knew a way to handle buffers more effortlessly in emacs. In vim I can ZZ out of any buffer or split. The emacs evil mode doesn't provide that by default and I couldn't map it myself in the config.\n  \nPS: I use the latest release of emacs in the Arch repos. I am a frontend web developer.\n  \nPS2: sorry about the lengthy post, just thought I'd share my experience. Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/Wolandark  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then the endnotes of a book will be sectioned by chapter.\nUsability problem\nNon-fiction paperback books usually only print the author and book title at the top of pages, so you don't have an easy way to know which chapter you're in.\nExample usage of bad endnotes\nIf you're on page X and want to know what endnote Y is about, you need to page back until you find the beginning of the chapter, or look up the chapter's page range in the table of contents first. Then you can navigate to the approriate section in the endnotes.\nRandom access vs bad sequential access\n\"Random/direct access\" would be possible if one of the page headers contained the current chapter title to make finding the appropriate section in the endnotes easier. Then you'd have all the information, the complete address, to de-reference the number Y.\nIf you page through the book, and simultaneously advance the endnote sections and leave a bookmark there, you would get \"sequential access\" that relies on a process like this.",

Ok, I don't understand why you would use the popular timestamp thing. Sure, you know when the note was created, and you fixed the issue with duplicate titles (which, really, who experiences?) Other than that, what? Then you have this unclean 12-digit number in front of your note title; amazing.\nI've been trying to use Luhmann's 1,2,3b,3c etc., system, which works fine, but there is no convenient way to use it (I am using Obsidian). I used this 12-digit timestamp on hundreds of notes, and it's simply useless. I need something else!\nYes, I researched other solutions, but they were not convincing and too geeky, as I recall. I wonder if someone had the same experience as me. The 12-digit timestamp prefix is missing the point of the Zettelkasten, IMO.

If you understand memory merely as the ability to parrot something that you have stored, memory is something completely different than if you are talking about availability. Do I have a good memory if I can name the back of an index card, but I can't access its contents when I'm supposed to be using it?\nMemorization takes into account a small part of this problem: It is a common recommendation that one practice \"Active Recall\" and not merely repeat the material (e.g., by reading through it several times).\nAfter \"Active Recall\", the key is to make content available when you actually need it, not just in the test situation. There is a difference between memory and the repertoire at one's disposal.\nBut it is difficult to operationalize the situation of actual use.\nThesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) (slightly edited by myself)",

I only know that I somehow found it online a few months ago, while researching note-taking and study skills. I'm not originally from Germany, but I live here now, so the German-sounding name 'Zettelkasten' piqued my curiosity when I first saw it.\nThe reason I was researching in the first place, is because I knew I would start studying for a Masters in October of this year. My Bachelors experience was way too ad-hoc. I just didn't have a good system. Knowing that I wanted to have a much better experience studying for a Masters, I was determined to get a good note-taking and connection-building system in place before my studies started. After some reasearch, I realized that the Zettelkasten method was what I needed, and I've been using it actively for about a month now.\nIt's still too early yet to have many links between notes, but I'm starting to build a nice network, one note at a time.\nThe forum history has already helped me, both to understand the method and to get ideas for my own personal implementation.

He seems to have a quite young Zettelkasten or at least does not make use of connection like I use. With a depth=2 a local graph by my Zettelkasten looks like this:\n\nThis is pretty typical when I browse my Zettelkasten and I am not able to get value from it. Of course, I am not practiced in using a graph view and my practice is by no means informed by a graph view. So, that could be confounders.\nSo, I find myself at a strange tension point: I really like using visual structures for my own Zettelkasten work. This is an example (actually from the book):\n\nBut whenever I run into the graph view I find myself unable to make it work.\nI am not willing to stop challenging my position on graph view yet. I have a gut feeling that there is a blind spot I am not aware of. But I am confronted with a similar issue like many people it seems: There are no genuine demonstrations out there but just mock examples. Bob's video is a very concise demonstration on how writing with a Zettelkasten can be realised. I recommend to watch it to enrich your perspective. But the youth of his Zettelkasten makes the graph view part not applicable to my own Zettelkasten.\nI filter methods and techniques by their longevity. And if the graph view cannot show its power with older and more developed Zettelkastens I don't think it is very promising to get into it. I want to concentrate my time and effort on methods and techniques that scale.\nSo, my question is: Are you aware of examples of graph view being used for more older and complex Zettelkastens?\nAdditional thought: Perhaps, the graph view is suited most to develop underdeveloped parts of the Zettelkasten?",

So, a card labeled 1 or 1-6 can essentially be found in both boxes.\nWhat's different, fascinatingly, is how he wrote them.\nIn his first ZK, we saw him use a comma \",\" (or in English, the period \".\") to branch his notes, but with the second one he used the slash \"/\". That way he can account for notecards 1.6 and 1/6 to co-exist in his wider note-card system.\nLuhmann probably would have changed it up if he wanted in a digital system, but I cannot blame him for taking the easy way out in that switch up. It was a good way to start over but leave no zettels behind. With that being said, even if he lived a lot longer, I'm not sure he would have opted to start a 3rd physical box.\n(Rather minor, but I wasn't sure if this fits more in \"Workflows\" or \"The Zettelkasten Method\" category.

As keywords are tightly tailored and the top level topics must be broad by their nature, so using tags for both would be confusing.\nThanks for feedback",

          "description": "Dear Zettlers,\nI am currently reading the Artikel The Two Definitions of Zettelkasten and am just a couple of hundred words in. @chrisaldrich contextualises the Zettelkasten Method within the bigger picture of using practices that seem to have something in common. I am perfectly happy to admit that I do the very thing that Chris is pointing out: My starting point it the article by Luhmann and while I am aware of the history Zettelkasten Method I never saw much practical value from reading the historical use cases.\nI, myself, am a pretty non-nostalgic character. My passion for the Zettelkasten Method is fueled by exactly two motivations:\nImproving my personal toolbox for knowledge work.\nGenerating tools to help other people to improve their toolbox.\nI see this as an advantage because I have little incentive to lose myself in tweaking tools or spending time on the tool for fun and joy (nothing wrong with that if you do because it aligns with your own goals, of course).\nThe downside of this utilitarian approach is that it creates a blind spot which can be a source of fallacies.\nSo, the question is: What did you learn from the history of the Zettelkasten Method? What is there to be found what is missing in the current collective thinking in the internet?\nLive long and prosper\nSascha",

          "description": "On GitHub, a user proposed to change \"ghost\" to \"mind\":\n\n  \nChanging ghost into mind. The mind refers to the mental frame, while ghost is the soul of a dead person.\n\n\nIn reaction to that, I wrote the first commentary to the translation:\nThe Zettelkasten as the ethereal ghost that hides in plain sight\nIn German, \"Geist\" means both \"mind\" and \"ghost\". The question spelled out could be something like \"Can the mind of the Zettelkasten be observed?\" Or something like that. So, why \"ghost\" instead of \"mind?\"\nThere is great anime film titled \"Ghost in the Shell\". It is quite a philosophical movie that asks the question: If your consciousness can be moved from your body and brain to machine are you still considered a human or will you become a computer program? One possible answer could be: If we can move from body to body, and we are still considered human we should be considered to be ghosts that take possession of bodies.\nWhat do the visitors see when they see everything and are disappointed? Perhaps, they feel the same disappointment of scientists who opened the scull of people to look at the human mind but see \"it all\": just flabby gray tissue.\nTo this day, this seems to be the feeling us who start their own Zettelkasten. The frankensteinian fantasy of creating something alive turns into obsession or disappointment. The mind of the Zettelkasten turns into a ghost, something ethereal and evasive that can hide in plain sight. We dive into our Zettelkastens in search for what we believe we created and just seem to find notes.\nSo, what is the Zettelkasten? One possible answer might be: The ghost that is able to hide in plain sight and just can be seen from the corner of the eye.\nWhat do you think about that reasoning?",
