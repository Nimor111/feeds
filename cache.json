Haskell, Python, and Java. Python and Java I have no problem with. But for some reason, I cannot wrap my head around Haskell. I have tried everything. This class is a requirement for my degree and only one person teaches it. I've done well in my other classes and am familiar with a lot of other languages and I feel like I am about to throw tens of thousands of dollars away on a degree because I am struggling with one niche language that I never want to use again. I passed all the hard classes in my degree and my entire education hangs on this. No offense to people who love Haskell. I understand it can be a great language in certain uses. Anyone who was like a lost puppy when they started learning Haskell, what resources did you use? My degree, financial well-being, and mental health depend on it. Haskell is worth about 25% of the overall course grade and I already bombed the first assignment. Unfortunately, her questions are very hard and the homework is very strict on using resources and other people.\n She low key expects us to be fluent in haskell in just five weeks.\n I hope this post is okay here.\n    submitted by    /u/ChickenFriedRiceee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is a very simplified version:\n data Expre = A | B | X Expre Expre process :: Expre -> Expre process A = B process B = A process (X ex1 ex2) = X (process ex1) (process ex2) \n Expre pretty much represents a tree with two leaf constructors.\n process has my rewrite rules for terms of type Expre. All it does is swap A and B around. I was wondering if there is a canonical, clean way to track each application of a rewrite rule? So, concretely tracking the changes of my expression: process $ X A (X B A) should spit out the following list of intermediate terms:\n 1 X B (X B A) 2 X B (X A A) 1 X B (X A B) \n The number in the front represents which rewrite rule was applied. This feels very much like a problem that has a generic solution using a typeclass/data structure/idea that I'm not aware of, so I was wondering if such a thing exists. \n My handrolled solution looks like this, there has to be a neater way:\n process :: (Expre -> Expre) -> Expre -> Writer [(Int, Expre)] Expre process fn A = tell [(1, fn B)] >> return B process fn B = tell [(2, fn A)] >> return A process fn (X ex1 ex2) = do e1 <- process (\\e -> fn $ X e ex2) ex1 e2 <- process (\\e -> fn $ X e1 e) ex2 return $ X e1 e2 \n Called with runWriter $ process id $ X A (X B A) in GHC gives the desired result.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Dimiranger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: Is it possible to perform an AST re-write that depends on global knowledge derived from the AST while simultaneously evaluating the AST -- all in a single pass?\n The \"Real\" Problem:\n I'm working on a Haskell -> Elm code generator. I'm parsing out an Elm type AST (see below). The problem is that multiple TyDecl varname nodes could exist after parsing. E.g: the following haskell type definition\n data Foo = Foo Int | Bar [Foo] \n generates\n TyDecl \"Foo\" [] ( TyVariant ( ( \"Foo\" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( \"Bar\" , [ TyApp \"List\" [ TyDecl \"Foo\" [] (!!! Recursive def of Foo here !!!) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] )] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] ) \n To solve this problem I am folding twice over the parsed AST.\n The first pass replaces all but one TyDecl \"Foo\" node with its TyApp \"Foo\" [] node. This is done by using an algebra\n preventDuplicats :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m) => Base Ty (m a) -> m a \n Following the example above this rewrites the above AST to be:\n TyDecl \"Foo\" [] ( TyVariant ( ( \"Foo\" , [ TyInt ] ) :| [ ( \"Bar\" , [ TyApp \"List\" [ TyApp \"Foo\" [] ] ] ) ] ) ) ( TyApp \"Foo\" [] ) \n The second pass evaluates the AST to generate the Elm code (essentially):\n generateElm :: Base Ty String -> String \n What I'd like to do is construct some mechanism that would let me perform this AST re-write (preventDuplicates) while evaluating with the main algebra (generateElm). Maybe something like?:\n evalAndPrevent :: (MonadState (Set VarName) m, Comonad w) => (Base Ty (w a) -> a) -> Base Ty (w (m a)) -> m a \n Ty Definition\n data Ty = TyVar VarName | TyApp VarName [Ty] -- This models `let` expressions in type declarations -- data B a b c = <a> in <b> == TyDecl \"B\" [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"] <a> <b> | TyDecl VarName [VarName] Ty Ty | ... deriving (Show, Generic) \n Attempted solutions?\n I've looked into prepomorphisms. However, this doesn't seem to work because the re-write morphism Base t a -> Base t a by defintion is a \"local\" only re-write.\n    submitted by    /u/yanhu  \n [link]   [comments]",

The core idea of Okapi is still the same: use monadic parsing to implement web servers.\n The biggest addition to Okapi since I last posted is the addition of named routes. One of the comments on my previous post asked if Okapi had named routes. At the time it didn't, but I think I've found a way to implement type safe named routes in Okapi without relying on Template Haskell or type-level programming like other Haskell web frameworks do.\n I've written a series of essays on the topic of named routes, and how they work in Okapi.\n  \nNamed Routes in Okapi: Part I\n Named Routes in Okapi: Part II\n Named Routes in Okapi: Part III\n  \nOkapi is still in the early stages of development, so I'm looking for feedback. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. Whether it's the design of the documentation, code conventions, the names of functions, concerns, etc. Please don't hesitate.\n I'm really interested to hear what non-Haskell users and beginner Haskellers have to say. The blog posts I listed above are probably more geared toward advanced-beginner/intermediate Haskellers, but feel free to check out the hopefully more beginner friendly documentation listed below.\n  \nOfficial documentation\n Hackage candidate documentation\n  \nDocumentation is still largely incomplete at this point, but I'm working on it. I want to get feedback on everything so far before going further.\n I can't recommend Okapi for production projects yet, but I've successfully been using it for small, long-running web applications of only a few users without any problems so far.\n Thank you for reading :)\n    submitted by    /u/MonadicSystems  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example given the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] should output [0,2,4,6,1,5,3].\n To solve this I wrote the following function:\n …",

          "description": "I was playing with the Brick terminal UI library and hit an interesting hurdle. Roughly, brick represents the program logic as two functions Event -> State -> IO State and State -> Image.\n I have some non-trivial IO (loading and parsing files, possibly transitively) which should not block key inputs. We can launch some async IO and send the results into an event queue which Brick reads from. But it is really annoying:\n  \nThe update function must know which async resources to load, duplicating parts of the rendering logic\n The update function must track which resources are already loaded\n The update function must track which requests are in-flight, or have failed\n Optionally, the update function may have to cancel requests that are no longer needed\n  \nThat's quite a bit of complexity for a simple update function! My approach so far has been Haxl-like. There is a function CoreState -> IO AppState which is run after every event is processed, and it re-loads all resources. Requests are represented by a GADT, and cached in an MVar wrapped map. A functionsend :: MonadAsync r m => r a -> m (Maybe a) retrieves the existing result, or starts a new request unless one is in flight. When a request finishes this queues an event so Brick updates.\n This solves some of the complexity issues but still feels kind of ad-hoc. Shouldn't Haskell be better at this sort of thing? Is there some existing approach to this?\n The only idea I had so far is some kind of declarative IO. The render function produces an Image, and the frame-work diffs images and produces some imperative commands to synchronize the world. Maybe the render function also could produce a sort-of free-monad trace, the trace is diffed, and the framework performs some imperative steps to ensure the minimal necessary requests are performed? But for diffing to work trace would have to contain which case-statement branches were taken, not sure how to do that without compiler support.\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

While writing each of these I realized there was a lot of similarity in the code to the point that it almost felt like the same thing three times. I realized if I was working in Prolog I could probably express this as typed(term, type, errorList) and then I could get supply a term and a type to see if if type checks, a term and an empty error list to infer the type, and a type and an empty error list to get program synthesis. It would be nice to be able to express this relation in Haskell with a similar style and elegance but I'm not sure if it's possible since I'm not sure if I can do logic programming with similar levels of optimizations in Haskell. logict doesn't seem to do any kind of optimization and I'm guessing this would make my code unusable in practice.\n Is my assumption that logic programming without optimizations is unusable in practice correct?

This plugin basically goes against the design of type classes but sometimes that is what we want. One safe use of this technique is to branch on extra-functional properties such as space, time, energy like choosing HashSet a if Hashable a is satisfied.\n But let's not only stick to safe use cases, what application can you think of for this plugin??\n    submitted by    /u/Iceland_jack  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are very happy to announce the release of Copilot 3.11. Copilot is a runtime verification system implemented as a Haskell DSL that generates hard-realtime C99. You can learn more about it at [1].\n Copilot 3.11 introduces a new library, copilot-interpreter, that isolates all functions related to simulation of Copilot specifications. The release also contains a number of bug fixes, provides a simplified API, deprecates outdated elements, removes unused code, and introduces support for GHC 9.2. A full list of changes merged is available at [2].\n A substantial effort is being made to achieve NASA's Class D software classification, most notably in terms of development process (which you can partly witness in how issues and PRs are being handled on our github repo), test coverage (mostly with quickcheck), and proofs of correctness of the generated code (with what4).\n Copilot is being used by the Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch (D320) of NASA Langley Research Center to conduct experiments related to flight safety of aerial vehicles. We have also built Ogma [3], a tool that allows us to generate full monitoring applications (e.g., NASA's Core Flight System [4] and Robot Operating System [5] applications) from requirements in structured natural language.\n We invite you all to explore Copilot, to try it, and to extend it. If you like it, please help us draw attention to this work with a star on github or a mention online.\n Happy Haskelling,\n The Copilot Team\n [1] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot\n [2] https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/milestone/15?closed=1\n [3] https://github.com/nasa/ogma\n [4] https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n [5] https://www.ros.org/\n    submitted by    /u/ivanpd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some weeks ago, I asked here, if there is a way to let GHC infer backwards constraints from instance declaration, i. e. for instance  instance (A a) => B a where  have not only forall a. A a => B a, but also forall a. B a => A a. It's correct, provided that we have no overlapping instance for B. In answers there were a link to an article on this topic. However, implementation from the article requires essential changes in GHC. I found some way to make this with currently available extensions (mostly type families) with not so much boilerplate and now uploaded it on github with my solution for the first problem from the \"Motivation\" section of the paper.\n However, I think, it's not quite natural. If this method is general enough and can be automated, it seems me very nice to have an GHC plugin or even GHC extension to make this without any hacks in code. For example, such syntax of class declaration:  class {-# BIDIRECTIONAL #-} A a where  will make all instance of this class bidirectional (and forbids overlaps).\n What do you think about it? More concrete questions: - are there any other (beside this article) conversations about this feature? - does this feature sound reasonable enough to implement it? - what are disadvantages of using bidirectional instances, besides it conflicts with overlappable instances? are the overlappable instances for most of classes (for example common classes from base) really used in haskell?\n I ask this to gather more pros&cons for this feature. If it will considered to be useful enough, maybe I'll try to implement it. Anyway, it's nice for me to learn more opinions about this.\n    submitted by    /u/Lev_135  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thus, I would like to share some of my thoughts.\n For some time now I had a project in mind - website that would teach physics. The issue was that I didn't know anything about web development. So I started reading about html, css and javascript, and I tinkered a little with Phaser.js and created very very simple game with it. I also tried wordpress, ihp and django. I also looked at purescript and halogen as was suggested to me on r/haskell three weeks ago. With none of those I spent more than 2 or 3 days though, so I do not really know much about any of these technologies. I just got my pinky a little wet.\n Anyway, thanks to reading discussions on this subreddit, I decided to settle on …",

          "description": "Hello everyone, I write Haskell as a hobby. I am still learning and some concepts are still very hard to understand for me. Since I mostly write Javascript for my day job, I recently got into a very interesting problem. I had to write some logic in where as set of data has to be checked through multiple other datasets and return a value or null at the end.\n When I thought this through in imperative way, I found that I have to write a massive set of if-else logic which might end-up being an \"if-else hell\" and quite unmanageable to in future. Since I knew I can chain a Maybe monad through multiple function using bind operator in Haskell. I ended up implementing something like this in JS. Here is the Maybe monad implementation \n class Maybe { __value; constructor(value) { this.__value = value; } static from(value) { return new Maybe(value); } isNothing() { return ( this.__value === null || this.__value === undefined || this.__value === false ); } just() { return this.__value; } do(f) { if (this.isNothing()) { return Maybe.from(null); } return Maybe.from(f(this.__value)); } \n }\n With the help of this I can do something like this --\n Maybe.from(1) .do(prevValue => prevValue === 1 ? prevValue + 5 : null) //return Maybe 6 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 5 ? prevValue * 2 : null) //return Maybe 12 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 10 ? prevValue + 30 : null) // return Maybe 42 .do(prevValue => prevValue > 100 ? prevValue + 5 : null) // return Maybe null .do(prevValue => prevValue < 100 ? prevValue + 50 : prevValue * prevValue) // will do nothing here .just() // return null since failed on 4th step \n Is my understanding of Maybe monad implementation correct? How similar it is considered to Haskell's implementation of Maybe monad?\n    submitted by    /u/Small-Shirt898  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand specific use cases, but I'm having trouble gaining a general intuition of what monads and applicative functors do. For example Typeclassopedia says \"the structure of a Applicative computation is fixed, whereas the structure of a Monad computation can change based on intermediate results\". By \"structure of computation\", do they mean that it behaves similar to an if-else statement? Like if b from (a -> m b) is 5, then do x, otherwise do y.\n What I took away from Graham Hutton's video on applicative functors was that they basically are an extension of fmap but for multiple arguments. This made sense, until I thought about the List applicative. pure (+) <*> [1, 2, 3] <*> [1, 2, 3] equals [2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], which makes the \"multiple arguments\" angle confusing. I know that applicative functors can \"embedded\" functions into context, and that's why the result of the List applicative was so, because of how it models nondeterminism. But idk it just hasn't \"clicked\" for me yet.\n I was wondering someone could explain the intuition behind monads and applicative functors.

And many apologies if I've mischaracterised anything - it's certainly not my intent to express \"rights or wrongs\" - the motivation here is that we have to teach our software classes about ethics and security, and this seemed a very interesting (and fairly accessible) case study to introduce that topic to a class where I've mostly been talking about code, testing, version control etc. Using a library that I taught some of the students last trimester.\n Posted also because it's an admission of why I've been replying in the comments more than usual on this even though I'm just some unheard-of academic in a small town - I had a class to write, so had to think about the topic more than usual last week.\n So this is me doing a first take on trying to introduce the social impacts of dependencies to a (small) Australian class. Feedback welcome, especially if I've mischaracterised anything so I can correct it for the future. [But even comments like \"you really should stop saying 'kind of' as a verbal tic so often\" welcome]\n (PS: I'll probably delete this reddit post after a month or two, so that years down the track, some old lecture of mine isn't lurking in public.

          "description": "Greetings from Colombia! \n TLDR: I would like to continue my learning journey, replacing a Rest Service with a new library in order to get experience with Scala, I don't know if Akka HTTP worth with their new license change.\n I'm a software developer with almost 4 years of experience, I've been developing on Python for the latest years, working on data gathering & cleaning, a little bit of machine learning, and some Rest Services with FastAPI.\n Since some couple of months I've been using Spark (Mostly DataFrames) for processing, Since then I fall in love with Scala and Functional Programming in general, I can not see the opportunity to implement high order functions, recursion, pattern matching in everywhere (I think even the way I think problem-solving have change).\n I've taken the Scala & FP Essentials  and Spark Essentials with Scala from RockTheJVM and I absolutely loved! \n Now I'm feeling that I would like to switch my career more orientated into Scala and functional programming, I feel I could improve some of the Rest Services in my current job replacing it with Scala, but I haven't seen a roadmap or something like that to use it for learning purpose. \n I was reading about Akka Http, but I don't know if does it worth to learn with new changes on their license (TBH, I'm only understanding that will be oriented in business), which library or framework should I learn? In my current job there is no tech team behind to report so I could choose whatever stack as long it is free to use. \n Thank you for your advices and reading this post!\n    submitted by    /u/Cond0rx  \n [link]   [comments]",

It exposes a purely functional API based on ZIO. It was designed to be simple to use, lightweight (unlike Akka, nodes do not form a cluster) and customizable: you can change the messaging protocol, the serialization, the storage layer as well as the source of truth for pod's health.\n It's been working great for us, so I hope others find it useful!\n    submitted by    /u/ghostdogpr  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I am a bit confused at the moment, that which tagless final approach is the right one. I know there are tons of resources out there which states that in tagless final pattern, we use trait as the algebra with a companion object. Most of the times, developers tend to do the implementations in the companion object as well, or create another class (interpreter) where they implement the algebra's functions. However, I have seen many solutions where the devs replace the trait + companion object combo with class + companion object one. \n Honestly, I am pretty confused which approach is the right one: \n // 1. trait + companion object approach trait Repository[F[_]] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] } object Repository { def apply[F[_]]()(implicit ev: Repository[F]): Repository[F] = ev def make[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F] { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } } // 2. class + companion object approach class Repository[F[_]]() { def findAll[A](): F[List[A]] = ... } object Repository { def apply[F[_]](): Repository[F] = new Repository[F]() } \n    submitted by    /u/t_peter_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The original solution was: (3)\n  (OPCODE_NOP, Instruction.Nop) \n But it turns out the second element of the tuple becomes Instruction.Nop.type, instead of a function as I would expect. My question is why is it so and is there a way to shorten the function (2) with placeholders to something similar to the last code block (3) ?\n -----\n Side note: implementors of Instruction have different argument sets, so currently I split them into multiple groups based on argument sets and handle them using LUTs:\n val handlers_type_reg_reg = List( (OP1, OP1_constructor), .. ) val handlers_type_reg = List( (OP2, OP2_constructor), .. ) val handler_types = List( (OP1, handler_type_reg_reg), (OP2, handler_type_reg), ..) \n So the top-level function would choose a specific function for a group of instructions based on an argument set and call it, the specific function would look up the constructor for the specific instruction and call it.\n Does it look sane or am I missing some beautiful FP / Scala expressiveness?:)\n    submitted by    /u/superdupermicrochip  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This has been bugging me for a while on my system. When I export an ODT document, the paper size is always stuck as A4. If I print this, my printer will hang with an error as it is expecting A4 paper, but we only have letter paper (8.5x11in). I finally set down to try and figure out how to change this today.\n It turns out, there is no simple option! This paper size is determined by the ODT style file that is included with an emacs/org distribution. One option is to explicitly define a custom style in the top lines of the org document itself, but this starts to get very messy quickly. I think the future solution needs to be a switch or setting to integrate with the ox-odt export functions, but that is for another day.\n What works on my system (linux):\n On my system, the style file is locate…",

          "description": "I write my blog with Zola, a static site generator written in Rust, but I'm also an emacser, so I wanted to export my org-mode files to Zola's markdown and set up an org-centric workflow. \n In order to do that, I searched for a solution outside but I saw no libraries. So, I thought I could tweak the wonderful ox-hugo exporter, which cover most of the needs in the \"org to markdown\" field, being it thought for Hugo (another static site generator which works parsing markdown files). I'm a newbie in emacs lisp, so I'm sure there are more elegant ways to achieve what I did, but my solution was forking ox-hugo (in ox-zola) and hacking it to make it compatible with Zola needs. \n There were some minor differences that made the exported broken, but now it should work by default. More specifically, I added this Zola-relative features:\n  \nCustom frontmatters parameters\n Lastmod/updated tags\n Taxonomies\n  \nI'm already using this library in production for my blog for a while, so I thought this could be the moment to share it with everybody. If you need this exporter, please use it; if you want to add features, feel free to make a PR.\n Thanks to all of you for this lovely community, I leave the link to the repo below.\n https://github.com/gicrisf/ox-zola\n    submitted by    /u/cromo_  \n [link]   [comments]",

It looks great! \n However, I wish to export my org-roam web to HTML, and publish this using some kind of SSG such that anyone can look at them without needing a configured emacs. Ox-hugo works great for this except for TikZ diagrams. Regular latex is rendered fine using mathjax, but mathjax cannot handle TikZ, and probably never will be able to handle TikZ. \n Ox-hugo and ox-html allows one to render latex using something like dvisvgm, however I don't want to use this for general latex equations that can be rendered using mathjax as it generally looks way worse than mathjax, particularly for inline maths. \n Is there anyway to change the latex ox-html/ox-hugo behaviour for a select number of latex fragments, while keeping mathjax for the rest? \n Alternatively, is there anyway I can preview the contents of a #+begin_src latex block? If so, I can stick my complex latex math in the src block and have it exported to svg, but still have my beautiful buffer previews. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/chuckie219  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use org-roam to link my notes together, and it would be great if an app recognized org-roam formatting such as backlinks, metadata, ids, and aliases. Also, I'm not a huge fan of how writing to org files requires you to basically fill out a form, I'd much rather edit it right in the editor, in a WYSIWYG fashion. \n Basically, I want an app like Obsidian but for org files instead of markdown. I know there is also Logseq, but Logseq uses wikilinks instead of org-roam's id-based linking format. \n Coincidentally, I'm just starting school for Mobile App Development in September. I don't have the skills to make this yet, but if nobody else does, I will for sure once I'm able to.\n    submitted by    /u/tonystark29  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I understand everything in the manual, but my changes keep breaking it.\n In this commit, all I've done is move two blocks from one noweb-ref to another (previously they inherited their noweb-refs from the subtree properties). This was intended just to clean up the org file without changing the output.\n The tangled shell scripts and zsh.toml haven't changed. But bash.toml (which I didn't touch at all!) now includes the #+begin_src and #+end lines of the :noweb-ref prompt-format block.\n I'd be really grateful if anyone could have a look at the diff and let me know where I've gone wrong:\n https://github.com/quarkQuark/dotfiles/commit/82551520806ad2e9c2b22e3bc4446c5352ce14c2\n I've also noticed that sometimes replacing a :noweb-ref header argument with an equivalent #+name makes every noweb reference in the org file expand to the empty string. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for when this happens, but going back to :noweb-ref always fixes it.\n Thanks in advance for any replies.\n    submitted by    /u/quarkQuark1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not here to ask for suggestion or any kind of comparison between the two, don't worry. What I'd like to know is whether org-mode could be useful for a specific use case, which could make me lean towards doom emacs rather than neovim.\n From time to time I have to write documentation for software packages at work. While doing so, we like to have both a pdf version (using latex) to hand to our customers and an html (or similar) version to be stored inside the git repository of the project. To avoid having to write two different docs, we initially used markdown and a custom pandoc filter (for headings, frontpages and whatnot). The problem is that this approach is very limiting when it comes to cross-referencing, captions, and tables with cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Hence we switched to RMarkdown, but having to write R code for the sole purpose of properly handling a few images and tables is very frustrating.\n Do you think that org-mode could be used to solve the problem once and for all? I know that tables in org-mode are pretty powerful, but I don't know to which extent. Nor if the same syntax would be correctly translated both in latex and html as it is with simpler tables.\n Also, if any of you uses org-mode to write scientific papers (hence using different latex templates from different journals) in the STEMs, I'd like to hear your impressions.\n    submitted by    /u/nickfaraco  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been trying to get something into the agenda view with org-agenda-custom-commands and org-super-agenda-groups but been failing miserably :D\n What I want is pretty simple and I'm sure there's a solution this, but I wasn't able to find it.Basically, I want to list all TODO items under a certain heading. For instance:\n * Tasks ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff ** non todo stuff * Not tasks ** some non task stuff ** TODO Some todo, but not under Tasks heading \n Now, what I would like to list in an agenda view is all TODO items under the \"Tasks\" heading, but not under the \"Not tasks\" heading. After running the custom command, it should be like this:\n ** TODO some stuff ** TODO some other stuff \n I've been trying to get this to work with the search command, but could not get this to work. I'm a bit at a loss right now, so any help, would be really appreciated :)\n ​\n EDIT: formatting\n    submitted by    /u/Domva  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before I started using emacs I thought wtf does that even mean? I don't care what else it can do. I have everything else exactly how I want it, I just need a text editor. \n For whatever reason, I made the switch from VSCode to Doom Emacs about 20 days ago. I knew vim keybindings and stuff already but I didn't use them on a day-to-day basis only on servers that didn't have anything else. I did pick up the evil keybindings quickly and after 2-3 days of installation and setup woes, my javascript editing environment was set up rather well. I started relying on vim-fu for code editing and it's so much more enjoyable (don't know if it's faster yet) than using a mouse. \n That made me want more modal-based stuff, I wanted my browser to have modal navigation. While I'd never switch to the emacs browser I installed vimium on my chrome and it works rather well. Now, I started thinking it'd be so nice to have a file manager that was keyboard-focused and da-dum-tusss, the penny dropped. Dired, so that's what they mean when they say \"Emacs is not just a text editor.\" \n I'm in the process of installing mu4e now and I'm slowly beginning to understand things about Emacs that just cannot make sense to you unless you've spent some time with it. I know I heard people say that but I always thought of them as denial-filled ramblings of people who have sunk a decade into learning a tool that's slowly fading.

Specifically, I'm running into issues when using tcell. Here's an example snippet to show what I mean:\n package main import ( \"github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2\" ) func main() { tcell.[cursor goes here - `completion-at-point`] } \n If completion-at-point is run at the position noted above, emacs locks up for several seconds. Based on a profiler report I ran, the lock up appears to happen at common-lisp-indent-function, but I can't find any evidence online that this is an expensive or slow function... I'm a little bit at a loss at how to fix this. Ideally I'd like to just disable indenting around whatever's happening here (since it's happening somewhere deep in the json rpc call). Can anyone else reproduce this problem, or has anyone else seen it?\n Edit: figured I'd mention that this problem disappears with lsp-mode, so I guess I'll be using that for the time being.\n    submitted by    /u/chopu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lets say I want Calc to understand a TeX formula like $\\int_a^b f(x) \\mathrm{d} x$. Clearly, there are many ways to write this, I could have just written \"d\" instead of \"\\mathrm\", the integral bounds could be just a single lower index indicating a region, \"f(x)\" could actually consist of derivatives with the same differential notation as \"d x\", etc. If I could use Backus-Naur form, I would define a non-terminal like\n INTEGRAL := \"\\\\int\" REGION INTEGRAND DIFFERENTIAL DUMMY_VAR\n and then individually handle all of these edge cases in each non-terminal. For instance, I could write REGION to accept empty patterns for indefinite integrals, or to accept just a subscript for regions, similarly for DIFFERENTIAL or INTEGRAND. Instead, in Calc, I have to write a messy rewrite rule to just handle the REGION part, and I am not even sure if the INTEGRAND symbol could be implemented since any integrand having terms that look like $\\frac{d f}{d x}$ would prematurely terminate parsing as the denominator would be interpreted as DIFFERENTIAL. It seems to me that Calc is formally incapable of handling these complications, but I may be wrong. Are there ways within calc to implemen the functinality I want? If not, are there libraries that allow me to augment Calc in this way? Failing that, I would be willing to use the Wisent parser generator, but how do I integrate it into Calc?\n    submitted by    /u/isabellaetore  \n [link]   [comments]",

And looking at the code, notmuch seems to relay on mm-view and other stuff for which I could not find documentation. So, basically, my question is: what functions can I use to access the HTML part of a mail within the notmuch-show buffer so that I can pass it to a process?\n EDIT: \n It's mm-dissect-buffer. When called wrapped within with-current-notmuch-show-messsage, you get a list of mm-handle objects defining the different parts of the mail viewed. To save the part, you can use mm-save-part-to-file.

I am doing some weird stuff with cached git statuses and I may be rendering an SVG icon for god mode.

Currently, I've put those text files in a #+begin_src text block, with a tangle. I then have a #+begin_src sh block taking two filenames as input variables that invoke the cli program with the filenames.\n The current workflow thus ends up being:\n  \ndon't forget to tangle the input files\n invoke the shell block\n  \nIdeally I'd like to somehow configure it such that invoking the shell block will auto-tangle the input blocks, or something to that effect (if there's an option to put them in a temp file and present the filename to the sh block, that's also fine). Is this something that can be done somewhat straightforwardly?\n Secondly, currently I have the following tangle instructions on each input file: :tangle (org-in-tangle-dir \"file.txt\"). The filename to tangle to is identical to the #+name: file.txt preceding the block. The org-in-tangle-dir function is defined as follows:\n (defun org-in-tangle-dir (sub-path) \"Expand the SUB-PATH into the directory given by the tangle-dir property if that property exists, else use the `default-directory'.\" (expand-file-name sub-path (or (org-entry-get (point) \"tangle-dir\" 'inherit) (default-directory)))) \n Is there any way to tell the tangle to use the #+name attribute as filename to tangle to?\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Foo-jin  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would love to see what people did in that area.\n Of course there is modal editing, see https://github.com/mrkkrp/modalka#other-solutions= . But most (all?) of them keep keybindings similar to the original ones.\n Personally, I'd like keybindings to be oriented at the things which the commands operate on, e.g. server, frame, window, project, directory, file, block, region, line, word, cursor. I'd love to have an elisp package which allows me to dedicate a key for each of these things, e.g. I'd dedicate \"a\" to \"server\" because with my current keyboard-layout, I type \"a\" with my pinky which I don't want to use so often and because I don't expect Emacs-server related commands to be called often. I could then type C-a and thus get access to many server-related commands, e.g. I could call \"server-start\" with C-a s. Then there'd be some easy mechanism to enter and stay in hydras, so that you don't need to type the prefix every time. E.g., the SPC key could toggle that behavior.

So, I'm reaching out to you all to see if any of you know how to reach him and could dm me the info, or point him at this post.\n The guy behind it is Matt Price. He teaches / taught at the University of Toronto.

Rather than be in separate floating program windows in your DE though, tmux windows are not visible until you cycle to them. So your setup might look like:\n  ________________ _________________ | | | | | | | | | | vim | node | | st | python | -> :next-window -> |________|________| | | | | | | | | | | watch | ranger | |_______|________| |________|________| \n Is there any way to get this functionality (multiple buffers laid out in different ways in one wm box that can be cycled through) in emacs?

(From what I understand, upon first starting the server, display-graphic-p returns nil.)\n The workaround that seems to be doing the trick is to add the above to server-after-make-frame-hook. (I tried adding the above to after-init-hook but it doesn't seem to work, and some poking around suggests that when the functions in after-init-hook are run when the server starts, display-graphic-p also returns nil.)\n Now, there are other things I want to run only when starting a new GUI session, so I've kept on adding things to server-after-make-frame-hook. \n Not knowing very much about the way all of this works, I keep thinking this is inefficient. For it seems that server-after-make-frame-hook gets called more often than just when I start what, on my end, looks like a new session: calling magit-commit, for example, will run all of the functions in that hook. \n So, what I'm looking for is some tips on how to activate some bits of my config in all and only the following circumstances: when a new GUI frame is opened but no other GUI frames are. \n One solution I would be happy with, but which I cannot figure out how to create, is to have a GUI dedicated daemon and another daemon, if needed, for terminal sessions. I'd then need to have a way of triggering some bits of my config only when the dedicated GUI daemon starts. \n Sorry if this a bit muddled.

I use helm and use helm actions heavily to accomplish things within a completion session (e.g. moving files, grepping). However, the more I use it, the more I think: it would be much better if it's a full dired!\n I like the multiple column view of `helm-buffers-list`. It in fact just imitates the native `list-buffers`, but in a pretty hacky way (it use spaces to pad each completion items to make it look like a table). I've written my own `describe-functions` and `describe-variables` sources that uses similar hack to give me a column of function argument list/variable value and documentation. It would be much better if we just use `tabulated-list-mode`, or some blend of it and the native `*Apropos*` buffer!\n In general I feel like lots of functionalities are implemented twice, once as a \"feature-full\" package, once as a simplified version in helm.\n My question is then: Is there any completion framework based on the idea of wrapping \"feature-full\" package out there? Do you think this is a sensible idea?\n I haven't looked much into other popular completion frameworks (ivy, vertico, etc), because I get the impression that they're typically at the more \"light-weight\" side of helm so are probably not what I want.

Now I am ready to bring my girlfriend into this hole, but now I have several problems as follows.\n  \nMy girlfriend uses a windows computer, and I have not used a windows computer for six or seven years except to play games, so I don't know how to configure it under windows at all. emacs is known to have a relatively average experience under windows.\n \nI am using doom emacs, except for the most basic operations such as C-bpfnaehk which are adapted by macOS as global shortcuts, I do not know the native shortcuts of emacs at all. My girlfriend had a slight experience with vim, mainly because I introduced her the vim mode in rstudio, she knows yiw, ci} stuffs like basic operation, but she usually mainly uses office, vim mode is just rarely used, and not skilled.\n So if I introduce it to the pit, I'm not sure to introduce her to install the classic vanilla emacs (surely a distribution that uses vanilla keybindings, such as centaur? or the vanilla version of doom?) Do you guys think it's better to let someone who knows a little bit about vim but is not very skilled use vim mode, or let her learn emacs' weird ancient vanilla shortcuts?\n \nFinally, a broad context question, do you guys have any suggestions for smoothing out the introductory curve for someone with little computer background (or even little programming background) to use emacs?\n \n Thanks for your help and I would be much appreciated it for any help and advice!\n    submitted by    /u/FreeAd7233  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did some investigation, created a stackoverflow issue (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/72769/38541), got help from the org-mode mailing list and eventually created a bug in the evil-repository for what I guess is the root issue for the behaviour (https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1642).\n It's been a bit more than a month now, and nothing has happened, yet the problem persist for me, even with the latest versions of evil and org-mode. However I can imagine that a lot of users use both, evil and tables in org-mode. And as a consequence, more people should stumble upon \"my\" issue and report or support it. So that makes me wonder if there is indeed something wrong in my configuration.\n As you can see in the stackoverflow issue, there is not a lot minimal configuration needed to reproduce the issue. But could there be any other package, configuration, switch, whatsoever that I could add in my configuration that would solve the issue?\n So my question is: Am I missing something here? Is this actually a problem on my side? Or do other people suffer the same problem, but it has not caught traction yet?\n    submitted by    /u/cgrabenstein  \n [link]   [comments]",

In comments, I wanted words surrounded by backticks to be highlighted like GitHub or lsp-ui-mode do. My init.el contains:\n (setq hl-prog-extra-list (list ;; Match `symbol`. '(\"`[^`\\n]+`\" 0 comment lsp-face-semhl-namespace))) \n Which gives me cool highlighting like:\n https://preview.redd.it/6b4y5wpjhzl91.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ca6e30cf16688802a31e62a28a5a284bab6da3\n As you can see, everything within backticks is purple, but the words between them are still grayed out.

          "description": "Recently my Emacs has been taking a very long time to start up — often around 8–10 s, and sometimes more. If I close Emacs and then start it up again, the startup time usually decreases to around 5 s, but then it increases back to 8–10 s after I put my computer to sleep. The really curious thing about this is that whenever I try to run esup or a similar profiler, the problem goes away entirely: Emacs starts near-instantly, and the profiler consistently reports around 3.5 s startup time (all of which is straightforwardly due to my init.el). I can find nothing else obvious which might be causing this delay — and, before you ask, I can’t quite remember when the problem started. Does anyone have any other ideas whatsoever as to what might be causing this or how I might be able to fix it?\n (For reference, my .emacs.d is at https://github.com/bradrn/.emacs.d/blob/bef9de6ad27e214fa5972ed220d839721d8febca/init.el; I am using Emacs 28.1 on Windows 10, without native compilation.)\n    submitted by    /u/brdrcn  \n [link]   [comments]",

It supports poetry, pre-commit, pipenv, pipx, pyenv, direnv, plain old virtualenv and pdm, and assigns the correct executable paths to buffer local variables of your favorite emacs packages. It also works for repos that use one or combinations of these tools.\n I hope I can help you delete a bunch of code and dotfiles from your init.el and projects!\n https://github.com/wyuenho/emacs-pet/\n    submitted by    /u/wyuenho  \n [link]   [comments]",

You see, the whole system is so complex, and everything so interrelated, that I feel that if I don't know everything about it, the things I do use will alway act differently from what I expect.

Ideally, to just use some nice theme, with good defaults, not looking for customization at this point. (watched some youtube videos where orgmode looked so much better than mine)\n is theming done per major/minor mode or based on packages or something else?\n any pointers on getting started with org-mode? I am going through orgmode.org rn and got somewhat familiar with the syntax. I am trying to evaluate it and I don't see the value yet. do i need any plugins for it?\n I am confused with the package managers and the options you have and how to import. Is there some rule of thumb I can follow that can help me simplify adding packages? I don't need 'options' right now, I need a 'do it this way, it gets you to 90%'\n I was watching some videos and saw this https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org, which is HUUUGE. Is there some other resource that I can just start with one piece/package at a time and keep adding more slowly?\n  \nSorry if this was posted before (it must have, I guess, but not recently), but I am after some specific things.

          "description": "I've recently installed elfeed and it works wonderfully. However, I have a question to which I was not able to find answers (either on the package's page or the internet) and I'm pretty sure you would be able to help me with. \n So here it comes:\n Whenever I invoke elfeed (M-x elfeed) it opens both a search buffer (*elfeed-search*) and the elfeed.org file I'm using to list my feeds. This means that, once I've exited the elfeed-search buffer, I see the elfeed.org file there. Is there a way to prevent this file from opening in a buffer (preferably) or to close it automagically when the *elfeed-search* buffer is closed?\n Thanks in advance for all your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Gus_Gustavsohn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A struggle that I often have writing prose in Org-mode (or in any text editor with a markup language) is when I need to review things.\n I like to review from a printed copy, I'm better at catching errors that way. I also enjoy the ritual of getting off of my computer, sitting on a desk with printed pages, a red pen, and a cup of coffee.\n For that, I'll export as latex-pdf or odt and print---no big deal. The problem is that when I go back to the computer to make the changes in the file, the positions of the words and sentences are naturally very different from the ones in the printed page. So I have to be constantly switching my view from two texts that are very differently formatted, and that is tiresome. So much so, that I will often make the changes in the odt file on Libreoffice Writer, losing my god-given editing shortcuts, and once they are all done, I'll copy the text and paste it back on my org file. But then I have to be careful with italics and other stuff that will change once I copy the text in the odt and paste it on org. If all I'm doing is writing some informal text, no biggie. But when on an academic writing, messing with footnotes I'd be playing with fire to work in that way. So I end up writing a lot of my academic writer in Writer instead of Emacs.\n The obvious easy solution would be to get used to review from screen, directly in the org file. But that wouldn't help whenever I have other people's review of my text, like advisors and other professors (and a lot of them will require something compatible to MS-Word anyway, for them to use track changes).\n So... any technical solutions of different workflows that I haven't considered? How do you deal with that?\n    submitted by    /u/copperbranch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I open a header or quickly scroll through a newly opened org-file, I can see how the buffer is drawn in a different font-size and color and with all the leading stars shown, and then it is quickly repaired. Why is that? Did I set some hook wrong?\n I managed to capture it in the moment being drawn (see picture). A fracture of a second later, all the headings will look like \"Szenen allgemein\". But this is redundant, I would prefer Emacs not to have to draw everything twice.\n I have custom-set the faces of the headings a little bit bigger and set them to Source Sans Pro font. The colors come from the theme doom-solarized-light. I use org-superstars to change the looking of the stars, but even if I didn't, why are there two stars drawn at first, with org-hide-leading-stars set to t?\n If I add +pretty to the doom module list, this behaviour is gone (although it should only load org-appear and org-fancy-priorities), but then there is some bug, everything gets extremely slow, taking five seconds to load a 1.3M-file and 1-2 seconds to open a header. I don't need org-appear and org-fancy-priorities, so I prefer the setting without the +pretty module.\n Any ideas why the buffer is drawn twice and how I can omit that?\n https://preview.redd.it/izkow5sm1ek91.jpg?width=1137&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea408f5b52194c8e23d70db50fb5eff91f2cb012\n    submitted by    /u/TiMueller  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As there aren't many modern manuals on zettelkasten-style note making, its always interesting to see new ones pop up in the space.\nDan Allosso has finished a major rewrite on his and S.F. Allosso’s earlier edition of A Short Handbook for writing essays in the Humanities and Social Sciences. This expanded edition has several new chapters on note making (notice that this is dramatically different than note taking) using a zettelkasten-based (or card index or fichier boîte if you prefer) approach similar to that practiced by Beatrice Webb, Marcel Mauss, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Hans Blumenberg, Mortimer J. Adler, and Walter Benjamin among many others.\nThe focus of the book is on note making for actively producing tangible outputs (essays, papers, theses, monographs, books, etc.). …",

I discovered this website recently and it immediately caught my attention, so I decided to join, because I've been thinking about creating a Zettelkasten system for some time and I found it one of the best sites I've seen to learn, with quite deep knowledge about the system from both Luhmann's and Ahrens' interpretations.\nSo that's it. I hope to learn a lot and actually starting to build my Zettelkasten.\nRegards.",
