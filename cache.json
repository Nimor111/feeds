My question is about the AI part of the game, where minimax is used. I was a little bit confused about the prune function:\n prune :: Int -> Tree a -> Tree a\n prune 0 (Node x _) = Node x []\n prune n (Node x ts) = Node x [prune (n-1) t | t <- ts]\n Why do we need such a prune function in Haskell (which has lazy evaluation). Why can't we just create a single infinite game tree, and run the fitness function on it to a certain depth, without creating a new finite tree via pruning? We can then reuse the same tree, by cutting it from the top after each move, and sort of expanding the (same) tree downwards. Shouldn't this also work? \n I then saw that one of the exercises of that chapter was:\n generate the game tree once, rather than for each move \n A solution for that exercise is provided here by someone on Github. However, it seems to me that here a new tree is generated after each move, and thus the tree is not shared during the whole game.\n    submitted by    /u/Most_Appearance_3751  \n [link]   [comments]",

Encoding is performed by recursively merging pairs with the smallest merge index until there remain no pairs to be merged, and encoded representations can be decoded backed into the original through vocabulary look-ups.

I'm playing around with sum types (or ADTs) of records, and I get this odd bit of behavior.\n  ghci> :set -XRecordWildCards ghci> data V = V{x :: Int, y :: Int} | W{a :: Int, b :: Int} deriving Show ghci> testq v@V{..} = v{x = 9} ghci> testq w@W{..} = w{a = 9} ghci> testq x = x ghci> :t testq testq :: p -> p ghci> testq V{x = 1, y = 1} V {x = 1, y = 1} \n First, I don't know why the type of the function is p -> p rather than V -> V. Second, I don't know why the function fails to change the x value to 9 on the last line. That might simply be my ignorance of how RecordWildCards works.\n In general, are sum types of records a terrible idea? Will things break if some of the records have fields with the same name? I suppose name clashes could be addressed by defining the records separately in their own namespaces, and then putting them all together in the sum type. Finally, if there's a particular reference that would be valuable for better understanding how records work in Haskell, I'd appreciate a pointer. But perhaps the manual is sufficient: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/records.html\n Thank you.\n EDIT: On a bit of investigation, it appears that you can use the same field in multiple records in a sum type. The bigger issue appears to be when a field is only in one record. You can write code that isn't type safe because it's calling a record selector that works on one record type on a different record type. Unless that's only ghci that lets you do that.\n    submitted by    /u/mister_drgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently, in my \"quest\" to understand Monads, people told me to study Functors, Applicatives, Semigroups and Monoids and understand how they work first. I did so and thought that I had finally reached an understanding with the whole thing... until I was told my understanding was wrong.\n Starting from the beginning: I went to study Functors, most places talking about them just talk about how fmap works, and I understood them as \"Anything that has a definition of fmap\". \n The other places talk about it's category theory definition: This, together with me reading that \"All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors\", made me \"click\" this exact thought \"Wait, if the definition of an Endofunctor is when a category maps to itself, and fmap returns the same typeclass as the one it receives as input, therefore the typeclasses are the categories here and that's why they're called Endofunctors! I got it!\".\n So I went to ask people about how a \"non-Endo\" Functor would be... and that's when I was told that the explanation I came with was wrong: Typeclasses are not \"categories\" in this context, people say \"All Functors in Haskell are actually Endofunctors\" because the \"category\" here (Called Hask) is the set of all types in Haskell (And indeed, all mappings to a type in Haskell yield... a type in Haskell), but that simply destroyed the prior understanding I had and made the word \"Functor\" meaningless to em again.\n Given that the concept of fmap and Functor are so closely related, is the fact that fmap always returns the same structure as the one of the input it is given (e.g. a fmap with a List will always yield a List, a fmap with an IO monad will always yield an IO monad, a fmap with a Either Monad WON'T EVER yield a Maybe Monad) just a coincidence, having nothing to do with the definition of either a Functor or an Endofunctor?\n    submitted by    /u/Sky_Sumisu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently bedridden and very ill but at least now I can have something to do!\n It seems like this is a recurring question but it is just really confusing and I need some guidance. \n I just want to hone my haskell programming skills meaning that whenever I find exercises or puzzles I will look for modules that implement functions I can use without having to write em myself. These packages aren't in base. For example on hackage I found digits. \n In python i would just create a venv, pip install away and trash the entire environment when done, leaving me with a clean global installation. \n Reading about cabal and messing with it ever so slightly I am already afraid that everything is about to go to hell. I read about hsenv and how supposedly it is kinda the same (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsenv) so I guess I can use that and just cabal install --lib away there but havent tried it yet.\n How do you guys do this? How do you mess around and experiment with non-base modules after which you remove what is unnecessary leaving you with a clean system? I just want to write some basic scripts, maybe at some point write some larger applications. Every single time I get drawn back in again (it is all for my own benefit, i am not required to learn haskell) I am met with this exact same nonsense where I just blank out and ditch it because my global installation gets f*cked. I am sick of it! I love the language! Have so for years! Help me love this tooling by telling me how you handle it!\n Edit: for the record i have everything installed using ghcup, i am also fairly familiar writing haskell code.

          "description": "So I'm just learning haskell, and I'm trying to add an external package for pretty much the first time. I wanted something to parse s-expressions, so I searched for that and came across this package (and basically nothing else): https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sexp-0.7\n I wanted to use this package, so I added it to my .cabal file (I'm using cabal-install), ran cabal update, and tried to build my program. After trying to build the package for some time, I got an error:\n src/Data/Sexp.hs:4:14: warning: [-Wdeprecated-flags] -XOverlappingInstances is deprecated: instead use per-instance pragmas OVERLAPPING/OVERLAPPABLE/OVERLAPS | 4 | {-# LANGUAGE OverlappingInstances, ViewPatterns #-} | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [1 of 4] Compiling Data.Sexp ( src/Data/Sexp.hs, dist/build/Data/Sexp.o, dist/build/Data/Sexp.dyn_o ) src/Data/Sexp.hs:200:25: error: [GHC-76037] Not in scope: type constructor or class ‘NoSelector’ Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘Selector’ (imported from GHC.Generics) | 200 | instance IsRecord (M1 S NoSelector f) False | ^^^^^^^^^^ Error: cabal: Failed to build sexp-0.7 (which is required by exe:sexp from sexp-0.7). See the build log above for details. \n More important than this particular error, I'm just trying to figure out if I'm doing the right thing. Can you just find a package on hackage and install it, or do you have to check for compatibility first? In this case, the package hasn't been updated in 7 years, but I was unable to learn that from hackage--I had to go look at its github page. I'm guessing the age is a problem, but I just don't have a sense of how to find packages and determine whether they'll be compatible with my setup.\n For reference, I'm running ghc version 9.6.5 in a nix develop shell.

I just had that \"aha\" moment with functional programming working on this when I realized what \"defining\" vs \"doing\" really means. To be clear, when I say \"defining\" I mean saying what a value is, as opposed to \"doing\", that is, going through the computational steps, procedural style. Anyway, here's my solution.\n type Peg = String type Move = (Peg, Peg) hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move] hanoi 0 _ _ _ = [] hanoi 1 a b _ = [(a, b)] hanoi x start goal temp = hanoi (x - 1) start temp goal ++ (start, goal) : hanoi (x - 1) temp goal start \n I'm sure there are problems with my solution, and this definitely isn't something that would be difficult to implement in a procedural style, but when I was first attempting this problem I was creating structures to keep track of where each disc was and what the size of each disc was, and seeing this solution I just got really excited, so I thought I'd share it :) thanks for reading all this if you did btw\n    submitted by    /u/sniffle_whistler  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a little bit of background, I'm working on a language for doing first order logic. The ast is just an instance of a pretty big recursive data type.\n While developing the language, I've ended up needing to write a bunch of functions that all boil down to recursively modifying a couple of the constructors, while leaving the rest untouched. (Eg, turning every \"Implies a b\" into \"Or (Not a) b\" while leaving everything else untouched).\n Not every constructor has the same shape, so there isn't an easy way to use wildcards while keeping the function recursive, and so to avoid writing a bunch of nearly identical recursive calls (elimImp (Not a) = Not (elimImp a)) for every function, I wrote an operator Ive been calling $$ that threads a function through every recursive constructor, and then elimImp can just be a case statement that only does its job, and then is the identity otherwise, and doesnt have to worry about keeping the recursion going. \n This thingy, $$, isn't exactly map, and isn't exactly apply, even though it's clearly similar to both. I am assuming it's a fairly common operation to perform on recursive data structures, but I don't know what I would be called. What exactly have I written?

Fields can be serialized and deserialized, allowing a type like [Update rec] to be parsed out of a JSON response - now you can have your API clients send just a list of fields to update on the underlying record.\n One of those functions is tabulateEntityA, which allows you to specify an applicative action f for every field, and construct a record from that.\n tabulateEntityA :: (Record rec, Applicative f) => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) -> f rec \n Several folks have recognizes that the form Applicative f => (forall ty. Field rec ty -> f ty) is a concept on it's own: the ability to distribute the type constructor f across each field of rec. In other words: the power of Higher Kinded Data without needing to incur the complexity costs for operations that do not require it.\n There is one last concern: the name. We have the concept, we have many functions that operate on the concept, but none of the proposed names have stuck out to me.\n I've got a GitHub issue to discuss the matter here: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/prairie/issues/16\n And I'll back-link the Reddit discussion here to GitHub so we can keep everything correlated.\n    submitted by    /u/ephrion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll explain why. Every other programming language forces the programmer to keep track of time in order to read and write the code. There is a notion of when things happen that needs to be considered, and this often makes it hard to re-use code and leads to unexpected interactions. Haskell code, on the other hand, requires no notion of time. Haskell code is tenseless, inert. Haskell code doesn't do things. Haskell code merely means things. That made it easier to learn, read, and write than other languages like Java or even Python and Javascript.\"\n This is the link to the comment -> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/s/uhjWTq0rRb\n I was curious if there's any resource that helps you learn haskell the same way the commentor learned.

          "description": "Hi. I'm working on learning Haskell for personal enrichment. I already know OCaml rather well and use it for personal projects, so Haskell comes fairly easily. (except those compiler messages are brutal for newbs)\n However, there is kind of an uncanny valley for me between the Haskell one learns in tutorials and the Haskell (and GHC tricks) one is actually supposed to use to write software. Some examples:\n  \nDon't actually use String, use ByteString\n In fact don't use lists at all when performance counts.\n Except obviously for iteration, when fusion is applicable. \n which, I don't know when that is.\n \n sprinkle around strictness annotations and seq liberally. \n also not really sure when to do that.\n \n Of course if you are doing X, you will definitely use pragma Y.\n  \nI'm also interested to find out about the 3rd-party libraries \"everyone\" uses. e.g. in Python, requests is more or less the \"standard\" http client, rather than the one in the standard library. In OCaml, you use the Re package for regex, never the Str module in the standard library because it's not thread safe and is super stateful.\n I wish to know these kinds of things that \"real\" Haskell programmers know.

This extension is an O/R mapper built on top of the ScalikeJDBC core library, drawing significant inspiration from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord library. For instance, you can run the following query just with simple CRUDMapper class/object definition:\n ...\n Thank you to all the contributors for this release! 👍\n * u/jchyb helped u/seratch resolve Scala 3 compilation errors for scalikejdbc-orm module (#1249)\n * u/kardapoltsev resolved missing tags in one-to-x queries (#2163)\n * u/xuwei-k did a substantial amount of work for refactoring and dependency management\n  \nWhat is ScalikeJDBC ?\n  \nThis library seamlessly wraps JDBC APIs, offering intuitive and highly flexible functionalities. With QueryDSL, your code becomes inherently type-safe and reusable.\n ScalikeJDBC is not just practical; it’s production-ready. Utilize this library confidently in your real-world projects.\n  \nCongratulations to the ScalalikeJDBC author and all other contributors for the new release ! 👏\n    submitted by    /u/Previous_Pop6815  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have previously worked as Java Developer in the industry and have around 4 years of experience working on Spring Boot framework. However, recently I changed my company and my new company uses Scala as their main language for developing backend applications using Play framework. I have joined as a Software Developer here (not Data Engineer) in hope for learning something new in the field of Software Engineering. I have gone through numerous articles on how Scala skills are considered to be niche skill and has scope mostly in Big Data and Data Engineering roles. I would like to get your valuable insights regarding following concerns :\n  \nDoes learning the FP way of designing applications will help me in longer run in SE industry?\n How much emphasis should be given to learning languages or say new paradigm (I am considering Scala to be more complex than Java, maybe because I'm new to FP) when one's goal is to become a good software engineer?\n Regarding the job market for Scala, I don't see much hope in my region (India) other than DE roles. I am still interested in Software engineering but afraid that investing time in it will be helpful in future or not?\n On the extreme side, should I go back to hone my skills on Java ecosystem (prepare for next switch) or focus in learning Scala language and its ecosystem for maybe next 1-2 years and see if I like it or not? \n  \nI tried to keep my doubts as clear as possible.

So I decided to just roll my own solution!\n There are quite a few quirks with the package right now, the main one being that it currently cleans the buffer and then repopulates it with the newly synced entries.. I am working for a smarter fix for this where it actually respects the buffer contents and just adds new highlights or modifies changed highlights to the correct entries, but I need to make this perfomant enough to not be a pain in the bottom to use..\n Well, here is the code! https://github.com/CountGreven/org-readwise I hope this helps some of you!\n    submitted by    /u/Fit_Advice8313  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would be great to have symbol name (defvar, setq) given to each list, but that would bog down if I were to create thousands of these things, right?\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Either they don't use Emacs at all and thus find the prospect too daunting or they find it too difficult to craft Org Mode into something useful. And this is a real shame because Org Mode is, in my opinion, one of the most useful features of Emacs. So, to help out new users I've created a tutorial geared towards people who are completely new to Org Mode and Emacs. I've included screenshots to show you what to expect as well as a configuration file you can drop in that will give you all the features described in the tutorial. Additionally, there is an org file with explanations of each element, so new users can more easily begin customizing their setup.\n I would encourage any new users to try it out and see if this helps you. For the Org Mode veterans in the crowd, I would appreciate any feedback you might have. \n You can find my tutorial on github here: Org Mode Better Defaults\n    submitted by    /u/he-who-greps  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/completing-read-strings\n The package provides a function, completing-read-strings, that allows to read strings in the minibuffer, with completing-read under the hood.\n Usage:\n (completing-read-strings \"PROMPT: \" '(\"first\" \"sec,ond\" \"third\")) \n  \nThe candidates are chosen by pressing RET.\n Pressing C-<backspace> erases the last chosen candidate.\n Pressing C-<return> exits reading and returns the list of chosen candidates.\n  \nRationale\n In completing-read-multiple, the result list of chosen strings is made by splitting the input string with crm-separator regular expression variable.\n This approach is not suitable in several situations:\n  \nCandidates might contain the default , separator. In this case, the candidate with , inside will be treated as two typed candidates:\n  \nExample:\n (completing-read-multiple \"PROMPT: \" '(\"first\" \"sec,ond\" \"third\")) ;; <selecting \"sec,ond\"> ;; => (\"sec\" \"ond\") \n A developer have to locally rebind crm-separator and tell the user which character to type to separate the candidates.\n (let ((crm-separator \"[ \\t]*|[ \\t]*\")) (completing-read-multiple \"Type `|' to select another candidate: \" '(\"first\" \"sec,ond\" \"third\"))) \n  \nCandidates might contain any character, so it's hard to pick easily typed separator. Example: Org headings, file names. In this case a developer might use \\n as a separator, which a user can enter by pressing C-o and moving the cursor 1 char forward to be able to display the list of candidates (which is not convenient).\n  \nExample:\n (let ((crm-separator \"[ \\t]*\\n[ \\t]*\")) (completing-read-multiple \"Prompt: \" '(\"first.\" \"sec,ond\" \"third;\"))) \n completing-read-strings solves the issue by providing a function that have the same interface for all kind of candidates. Internally, collects the chosen candidates into a list during reading and then returns it (without the need to split the input string with regular expression).\n    submitted by    /u/ichernyshovvv  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I call `lsp-execute-code-action`, expecting auto-import action to be executed, emacs creates empty file and moves me to there instead.\n When there is no code action, LSP inserts a dumb action for creating a new file and moving there. So if LSP is too slow to find out the actual code action needed, it creates a new file instead.\n This issue is ruining my workflow and wanted to ask if anyone else encountered.

I noticed that if I opened an 11MB org-mode file (that used to give me no problems with speed or performance on 28.2) and then invoked org-refile once, then suddenly any user interaction involving the big 11MB buffer (from text entry to simply activating the buffer) would take forever to execute.\n I wondered if it was something in my config, and eventually noticed that switching org-refile-use-cache from t to the default nil stopped the slowdown from happening after invoking org-refile. I confirmed the issue was seemingly solved by running a minimal org-mode config in an emacs -Q session and observing that the slowdown only happened if org-refile-use-cache was set to t.\n So I decided to just stop setting org-refile-use-cache to t and everything …",

This seems to be random: sometimes I will type 20 or more spaces with no beeps, other times two or three consecutive spaces might beep. The space-bar is bound to regular self-insert-command as you would expect.\n Does anyone know how to prevent this harmless but very irritating quirk?\n (And why is it happening straight out of the box?)\n    submitted by    /u/MichaelPTaylor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to code faster in Python.\n For a Mac user, what are the key-bindings you suggest is optimal?\n Best use cases of org-mode as a PhD student?\n Best LaTeX packages & engines I need to install on Emacs? Currently I use Overleaf to work with collaborators, but would love to work on Emacs and push things to Overleaf (my vim friend does this).\n Ways to use Co-Pilot on Emacs? Is it worth it?\n Any other cool Emacs things (packages or modes) I should learn as a PhD student?\n Any cool stuff that can wow me about Emacs?\n  \nPlease feel free to help even if you are not a PhD student. My goal is to learn how to use Emacs better at the end of the day..\n    submitted by    /u/InstinctsInFlow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I would like to create a link in my dailies to my present note as soon as a date block (2024-05-23) is existing in my notes. I usually write with org-roam. I must admit, the division between my dailies and other notes is not well done... but it is how I am working now.\n I would like to have the possibility when the point is on a date (for instance 2024-05-22) to create a link in my dailies to the current heading, to the proper daily note if existing, or to a new daily note if not (under a predefined subheading)\n With the help of chatgpt (sorry, no dev here), I have this code:\n ``` (defun my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point () \"Create or open an Org-roam daily note for the date at point. If the daily note already exists, add a new heading.\" (interactive) (let ((date (or (thing-at-point 'date) (format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d\" (org-read-date nil t))))) (if date (let ((parsed-date (org-read-date nil t date))) (org-roam-dailies-goto-date parsed-date) (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) (goto-char (point-max)) (unless (bolp) (insert \"\\n\")) (insert \"* \"))) (message \"No date found at point.\"))))\n (define-prefix-command 'org-roam-map) (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c n\") 'org-roam-map)\n (with-eval-after-load 'org-roam (define-key org-roam-map (kbd \"d\") 'my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point)) ```\n 2 problems I see: 1. I want to use a keybinding when the point is on a date to create the link ==> I am not sure the latest part for the creation is OK and that the proper keymap is chosen\n  \nSo far, instead of reading the date at point to create the daily note or insert the link into an existing one, it uses the function org-roam-dailies-goto-date which asks again for a date from the calendar. \n  \nhow would you improve this function? thanks for your ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/fmou67  \n [link]   [comments]",

I often need to launch several R sessions per script, and it becomes very annoying.\n Is there any way to tell ESS \"for this project use R from this conda environment\"?\n Edit:\n this workaround is acceptable for now, I guess:\n  (defun ess-remote-auto () (interactive) (setq num (read-number \"input: \" 1)) (setq env-dir (read-directory-name \"input: \" \"../env\")) (when (one-window-p) (split-window-horizontally)) (other-window 1) (let* ((buffer-name (format \"*R-%02d*\" num)) (buffer (get-buffer buffer-name))) (if buffer (switch-to-buffer buffer) (shell) (process-send-string (get-buffer-process (rename-buffer buffer-name)) (format \"conda activate %s \\n R\\n\" env-dir )) (ess-remote buffer-name \"R\"))) (other-window 1) (ess-switch-process)) \n    submitted by    /u/cat-head  \n [link]   [comments]",

It gets to the point where: If I want to continue writing my commit message, I have to backspace, then hit C-q SPACE (since SPACE on its own triggers the word wrap behavior), which is a really obnoxious way of typing.\n So my question is: Why does Magit even bother putting the line break in there, if it's just going to complain about that same line break in ten seconds?

I will describe what I want to make first\n  \nUse pylsp through eglot,\n Have a virtual enviroment for each python project,\n Be able to manage the enviroments through emacs (tried poetry and pipenv),\n Have the linting, lsp, jedi, black, flake8, ruff, etc installed out of my project venvs, as some of these are shared with others.\n Have it easy to change, or automatic between enviroments when I change projects.\n  \nI have tried some things (pipenv, virtualenvwrapper and poetry), but it ends up breaking when I try to isolate projects. It sort of worked when I had everything installed directly on debian, when I tested things with a fresh install, but not if I try to leave the system packages alone, as one should do with python and have venvs for each project.\n What happend most often is that eglot/pylsp did not recognize the installed packages in the venvs, I tried to install pylsp in one \"general\" venv, I it worked well, untill I realized that I did not have the projects in enviroments (I had created several accidentally with poetry and venvwrapper at the same time, and neither of those where active when developing), and the dependencies where a mess as result.\n So I ask in general what would be the best practice to keep things clean?, and in more detail:\n  \nwhere to install the lsp and other IDE packages,\n how to make emacs aware of the enviroments to manage them, \n know what enviroment I'm in, \n be able to change enviroment,\n install packages to the enviroment.\n \n How to make eglot understand that the project has its own enviroment and should recognise the installed packages in the enviroment?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/hunajakettu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do see the messages, but they are all encrypted.\n The ement manual mentions the pantalaimon daemon as a way to get encrypted room support, but even after setting it up and connecting with (ement-connect :uri-prefix \"http://localhost:8009\") the messages are still encrypted.\n Here's my pantalaimon config:\n [local-matrix] Homeserver = https://matrix.beeper.com ListenAddress = localhost ListenPort = 8009 UseKeyring = false SSL = false \n I can confirm that pantalaimon is correctly configured because I am able to read all my messages from Element using http://localhost:8009 as the host.\n I don't understand if I am misunderstanding something or if it is just not possible to use ement in this way.

          "description": "I wanted to make a package, mostly for myself, where I could have a bunch of org files that I would use as templates for projects.\n Let's say you want to create a C project. The org file would contain code blocks with a basic hello world file in the src folder, and a basic Makefile or something. The package could also be asked to create a git repo or whatever else you want. You would then call a function, select one of the project templates, be prompted for any optional argument the template may have (like libraries maybe) and create the project structure by tangling the source blocks.\n I managed to make this work, but I hit quite a bothersome snag in the road.\n Makefiles NEED tabs to work. And org discards tabs when tangling, replacing them with 4 spaces.\n I have no way to make this work seamlessly. I can set org-src-preserve-indentation but that makes it so the two space margin added to source block for styling is also included in the final file, so I need to make them all not have this margin, which sucks.\n It also means I need a way to set this variable not only when tangling, but also when editing so org doesn't discard the tab there as well. I made it a file local variable, but it's considered risky so you are prompted to apply it, which is annoying as hell.\n This thing just killed my idea, because I don't like the compromises just for ONE single file type.\n BTW I do know of skeletor's existence, but I think it tries to do too much and ends up being quite bothersome, constantly needing external tools, and not even using built in features like completing-read, and instead rolling its own.\n    submitted by    /u/Guiding2011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear Emacs veterans,\n I encountered a situation like the following. I am working on a project and a tool is used when building the project. The tool requires me to add a line in my `.bashrc` which `source` a script file that does something and source another three files. This means without sourcing the file, that tool is not usable from command line and I can't build the project. Recently, I am learning to use \"compile\" command of Emacs to work on this project. I found because that tool needs that sourcing of the script, I can't simply make use of the tool with \"compile\" command.\n One possibility is to dig through all the scripts involved, figured out what they do, and somehow set them up manually in some fixed way, but this would be a tedious work, also, it'd be not reliable after I upgrade the tool in the future.\n Currently, my solution is that I use `bash -i -c 'the_tool params..'` instead of `the_tool params...`. Although this works for me for the case at the moment, it's not very handy, and I wonder what the better solutions out there that experienced Emacs users will do.\n It seems I can also make Emacs source my `.bashrc` when Emacs starts, but I am not sure if I want to source `.bashrc` every time my Emacs loads, because this tool is only needed for doing a particular type of project development.\n I wonder what would you guys do for this situation. Thanks in advance for you input.\n P. S. I didn't say the name of the tool with an intention that I want to know ways to deal with this as a general situation, instead of learning for example, that a package exists that is for this tool for this situation.\n    submitted by    /u/qiattsik  \n [link]   [comments]",

The extension of the org-mode headings hierarchy into a graph (parent-child-friend) with org-brain is great for me.

I am working for an apartment complex and I need a way to inventory all the fixed and non-fixed assets. I don't want to just go with a relational database or even a spreadsheet. Yes, org-mode/brain is text- and file-based, so each inventory item will be a separate file or heading in a file, but I don't want even more separate files and/or headings for each inventory item's details. One idea I had was to create a lisp defvar symbol for each inventory item (e.g., screens, garden hose, picnic table, etc.) and have a list (a-/p-) assigned to the variable with additional info, e.g., '((size xxx) (count 10)...). But then I've got a huge amount of global variables going on in an Emacs session. This seems impractical, but, hey, I've seen crazy data management stuff done in Emacs lisp.\n Another idea is to do the items as org-mode/brain files or headings, then put item details in an org-mode table -- and rely on the whole org table ecosystem. Another idea is have item details in a custom drawer in a file or under a heading. Another is have very broad inventory categories as variables, then attach huge lists of lists of lists to each variable. (e.g., custom-set-variables in my init file with hundreds of lists.) In general, the Lisp world is wont to leverage the abstract syntax tree, and org-element is there to help with that. But where does my situation fit in, is my question.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I read a bunch of comments comparing Org Mode to Markdown and editors like Obsidian but there are some points I want to discuss. A big benefit Emacs Org Mode seems to be the built in functionality for things like tasks and times, but that can be done in Obsidian with plugins like Dataview, for every other functionality Org Mode has like that can be done with an Obsidian plugin. I've also read a lot of comments that you can make your own Org Mode functionality using Elisp, Obsidian OTOH uses JS for plugins and code snippets, and I've written a handful of my own snippets. the JS library ecosystem is much larger.\n I get that Emacs has been around for much longer and the Lindy Effect where things that have lasted a long time are likely to last for much longer, however there seems to be far less support for Org outside of Emacs (besides Neorg). OTOH there are many Markdown editors and libraries, so if I decide I want to switch from Obsidian then I could and my Markdown Notes would render fine. I have many notes and don't have much proprietary Markdown in them. What if I became heavily invested in Emacs but in the future felt like using another editor? Or the slim possibility of Emacs development eventually stopping? A lot of Org Mode functionality seems to be specific to Emacs / Emacs' environment (same thing Obsidian JS really). I read one comment saying that implementations outside of Emacs are half baked, like support for Vim motions and features outside of Vim and Neovim.\n I've been spending lots of time setting up Neovim, and right now I'm thinking of using that with Obsidian for Markdown editing with Vim motions. But I want to know if Org Mode / Neorg would be worthwhile.\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to use TRAMP to edit files remotely, but a session will only last for five minutes, after which a new connection is opened. This leaves a massive papertrail on the machine which I'd like to avoid, instead staying connected for as long as I'd like.\n I already checked my SSH-settings and don't have these kinds of problems when I am connecting via SSH regularly, which leads me to believe that this is related to Emacs/TRAMP. I have tried to set the ssh session timeout to nil via `(add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties '(\"/ssh:\" \"session-timeout\" nil))` but so far it does not seem to yield the desired result.\n The setup in which I work features a jump host, so that I connect via SSH twice (once to the jump host, than to my actual destination). I have adapted the SSH `ServerAliveInterval` accordingly on both machines, to no avail.\n Do you guys have another tip on how to configure TRAMP so as to make it work as desired? I'd really LOVE to use TRAMP, because it allows me to use Emacs when editing files remotely instead of vim (which is installed on remote machines).\n Have a good day, fellows!\n    submitted by    /u/olivuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing I've just noticed is that unlike Emacs, the Vim community has a healthy collection of online vim games: VimAdventures, VimGolf, Vim-Racer (my personal favourite with lots of bias) etc.\n The idea just dawned on me that it would be a really low lift to add support for emacs in vim-racer. I'm curious if there would be any interest in an online game for emacs. The game is based around navigating code/text, and your speed determines where you place on the leaderboard.\n Is the lack of online games just a community culture difference i.e. Emacs users just aren't interested in emacs based games, or would you play a game like vim-racer if it had support for emacs?\n    submitted by    /u/Crippledupdown  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was wondering if there is an equivalent in emacs.\n On a related note, I want the same for URLs, similar to https://github.com/dequis/tmux-url-select \n I was thinking there might already be something in emacs, or perhaps I could achieve this with Hyperbole or some other plugin, but so far could not figure it out. It should not be too hard to script this (I guess you only need to search the buffer for certain regular expressions and then allow the user to select / act on them), but I do not want to reinvent the wheel here.

          "description": "I write a lot of math heavy documents in org-mode and inline latex fragments really irritate my aesthetic sense. They aren't incorporated into the text smoothly like in a real latex document; when the math has sub and/or superscripts it gets a vertical offset relative to the main text and the font doesn't match the main text either. Equation environments are not as bad, the difference compared to the main text is less obvious there.\n I had the idea to solve this problem using unicode math. There are unicode symbols for basically everything math related, and they blend into the main text nicely, even the sub and superscripts. I managed to set up org-mode to latex export to work with unicode math using the answers in https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20062/exporting-unicode-characters-to-pdf-using-latex-from-org-mode . The only remaining question is how to write unicode math efficiently.\n I have a nice latex setup that mostly relies on abbrevs and yasnippets. It is very straightforward to set up analogous abbrevs/snippets for common unicode math symbols in org-mode, problems only come when I try to implement sub and superscripts. These work in a completely different way in unicode. Instead of having to surround things with {} or _{}, there are separate sub and superscript versions of many symbols. Should I just make sub and superscript versions for each of my snippets + all the regular letters and numbers? There has to be a simpler way. I also came across the package https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el that seems to do somethings similar to what I want, however it does nothing about the sub/superscript problem.\n    submitted by    /u/acosmicjoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I spent a lot of time reading and thinking about if I want to learn Emacs or Vim since they have very high learning curves, I went with Vim because I had been looking a way to better edit text. Vim's modal editing is very powerful, allowing me to make lots of changes to text with only a handful of keystrokes. I wonder if that's why most Vim and Neovim users chose it over Emacs and if that's why Vim is much more popular than Emacs.\n Emacs is a modeless editor and you need a third party emulation like Evil mode for modal editing, but that's not full Vim. You wouldn't be able to install Vim or Neovim plugin, especially ones that extend its modal editing capabilities like the Vim surround plugin. Perhaps it might be possible to use the headless Neovim backend for text editing in Emacs, like the VS Code Neovim extension or Firenvim Firefox addon does, but why do that when you could just use Neovim?\n I think that all the extensibility Emacs has to make it essentially an app platform alone isn't something that appeals to a lot of users, but what if Emacs had modal editing as good as Vi / Vim's from the start? It seems like Vi Vim and even Neovim never had the level of extensibility as Emacs does, so what if it was a matter of picking between a modal editor, and a modal editor with lots of extensibility? (an oversimplified hypothetical comparison but still).\n And by the way, what was the rationale for the decision of Emacs to be a modeless editor rather than a modal editor?\n    submitted by    /u/TheTwelveYearOld  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I met my husband 10 yrs ago, he was everything I ever wanted. We met on a freenode IRC channel. He was a Gentoo and Linux-from-scratch dual-booter who could install both systems with his eyes closed. We used to have long, romantic conversations well past midnight about tabs vs spaces and open source. Our first fight ever was about MIT vs GPL licensing. On our first date, we shared our tiling manager config files with each other (this was the first time I truly felt love for a man).\n However, lately he’s changed into a husk of the man he used to be. He migrated to Linux Mint, because, and I quote, he “just wants to get work done” and he “no longer has time to fiddle with [his] system”. Then, he started using GNOME for the same reason. This was already very suspicious. I mean, if he truly just wanted to start using a full DE, he could have at least picked KDE, right? Even Xfce I’d have been ok with.\n Then, the other day, our relationship hit a breaking point. Here I was, working on my 2012 NixOS thinkpad, and hubby calls me over to his office. He said he “wanted to show me something”. I sit down on his chair, and you can imagine my terror as he pulls up vim on his terminal. He had a weird smile on his face, as if something had taken him over. He spent the next few mins “showing off” a variety of vim tricks he’d just learned. I had to turn my face to the side so he wouldn’t see the tears drying on my cheeks. Let me be clear: This was NOT the man I married.\n Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but I never imagined my husband would stoop so low as to become a vim peasant. I don’t know what to do. Part me says I should just start divorce proceedings and get it over with, but the other part can’t help but wonder if perhaps my husband is being afflicted by some serious, undiagnosed mental illness.\n Please advise reddit, my whole life is in shambles and I don’t know what to do\n    submitted by    /u/gentoogirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sorry not using it for more than those 2 things, please have mercy with me. \n So back to my idea. That email \"client\", well actually it is just a viewer, the receiving and sending part would have to be done with offlineimap, sendmail and friends:\n  \nthere are different orgmode files, e.g. ~/org/mail/inbox.org, ~/org/mail/sent.org, ~/org/mail/drafts.org and all of them contain headlines which actually are emails, but they are just rendered as headlines.\n The headline includes the subject, but could also include some state such as READ or SENT\n The body is the text of the email\n Attachments? Use org attachment to add them\n Maybe we could also use properties for recipients or use the tags, I'm unsure about this one \n a scheduler would iterate over those files every few minutes/hours and actually sends that email (headline) \n you can archive an email, which would actually just refile it, or you could also move things around like refiling\n I don't know if you can partially set some parts of the buffer to be read only, I don't know if it would make sense to set all those files to be read only, hmm\n use org capture templates to write a new email, depending on the cursor position it would either be a reply or new mail\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Valuable-Date-896  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used to write (too many) jupyter notebooks with VSCode but I find that I can organize my code & notes better with org documents and just simple Python files. I started using emacs-jupyter after reading Martí Bosch's blog on the topic. My current workflow is just opening up a python file (or write a new one), then running `jupyter-run-repl` and then `jupyter-repl-associate-buffer`. Then I do execute a region or execute line-by-line via `jupyter-eval-line-or-region` bound to `C-c C-c`. The thing with this workflow is that the jupyter REPL gets quite long as I'm tweaking little things about the graphs or visualization I'm working on. Is there a better workflow that people use for doing this kind of work? I also can't find a way to clear the jupyter REPL that I'm working on. \n    submitted by    /u/PlasmidPirate  \n [link]   [comments]",

But curious what other editors can also do this, and how they compare in abilities?\n 4) Amongst the variants of emacs, which is best for this? For my use case it needs to work just as well on Windows as Linux.\n 5) Also feel free to share any personal anecdotes on what discovering this paradigm meant to you personally. \n Including where you've seen big improvements in usability/efficiency etc\n And maybe also were there any specific use cases where you over-estimated how useful it would be?

I had my emacs phase but am a strong vim user for plenty of years.\n For less distraction, I use a Windows 7 laptop at home, while I use a modern Linux one for work. I manage all my TODOs and Notes via vim on a server that I can access from both via ssh/mosh.\n I have plenty of vim tabs per instance, and several instances. All in a named tmux session that I can attach/unattach everytime I want to read it, so that I never have to actually reopen them. I thus have \"built a GUI\" by permanently using the same tmux splits.\n How would I do this in emacs (tui)? - I know that remote editing would usually be done via TRAMP, but I really want to keep the window open on the server. - Emacs within tmux is clunky because of overlapping bindings and nested terminal emulation. - I am confused on the differences of emacs server vs emacs daemon?\n    submitted by    /u/NumericallyStable  \n [link]   [comments]",

One thing i'm trying to work out though, is how i can make the article summary a bit easier to parse. Two things i'm looking for:\n  \nThere seem to be three \"Date\" options. \"%D\" as the date from the header, \"%d\" as an Article Date with only Month and day, and \"%o\" as the article Date in a long unseparated format. Is there any option to get a custom date format in there? %D is super verbose, including also timezone and such. \"%o\" is hard to parse as a non-separated string. \"%d\" is not enough granularity\n Can individual parts of the summary line be bolded or italizised? I'm looking to have the From Adress in Bold to better find it.

I picture us as carpenters working in the middle of the woods crafting excellence, although instead of wood and carpenter tools we use our brains, our zettlekasten and pen.\nI don’t want to say too much because it’s not the point. Let’s just say I lost something that was really important to me. Something I cared, cherished, loved, tried to understand and that always put a smile on my face.\nNow that it’s lost I have to learn what to do with this. I meditate and being mindful of all the feelings that arise inside me has been a really interesting experience. It of course doesn’t stop the grief or the sadness, but I think it makes it healthy. I’m at peace with my feelings, seeing me as the place where the river just has to flow.\nI’m considering reading Albert Camus - The Stranger and No Mud no Lotus - Thich Nhat Hanh.\nI’ve read before this event in my life works from stoicism and Buddhism which I think are really helping me to experience this in the best way possible.\nWell, thanks for reading and I will appreciate the suggestions of books you found helpful during times where your psyche was put to the test.",

When I branch of from 1a into 1a1, it also normally means, that 1a1 (and 1a2,...) provides analysis of greater details of 1a1, which now becomes the main context for all the children. It does not only mean that I got back to the topic of 1a later, while I had made notes about different topics in 1b and 1c in between. Thus, it seems to me there is a playful tension between a formal structure (topic, subtopic, detail and so forth) …",

I was intrigued, and spent some time reading and researching about it, but I just couldn't visualize how it actually worked.\nThen last fall I was helping my wife find a replacement for Evernote for her recipes, and discovered Obsidian. (It was more than she needed, she went with SimpleNote) but I was intrigued by the idea of linked notes. I downloaded it, watched some videos and started putting stuff in it. I had used various programs before, but they ended up just becoming archives of stuff, and not really useful for production of ideas. I'm working to not fall in that trap this time.\nProbably the two most helpful things for me have been Sonke Ahren's book and a few videos by Morgan Eau on YouTube.

          "description": "Many note-taking apps like Obsidian provide the graph view functionality to visualize the relation of notes. But this kind of graph view only bases on linkages/references(incoming links and outgoing links) between notes. It is hard to recognize a specific long COT(chain of thoughts)——the starting point, the path and the end. Different COTs crossing in the graph view makes it more chaotic.\nLuhmann's zettelkasten is a \"combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection.\"\nThe graph view(generated by linkages/references) in some ways can represent the aspect of disorder of a zettelkasten. But what is the aspect of order?\n\"The absence of a fixed system of order and, in consequence, a table of contents turned the index into the key tool for using the file – how else should one be able to find certain notes again and thus gain access to the system of references? Not wanting to rely on pure chance requires being able to identify at least one point from which the respective web of references can be accessed. This is the purpose of the keyword index.\"\nBase on my understanding, the aspect of order in Luhmann's zettelkasten is composed of his note IDs and keyword index(register).\nAs so far, I don't find any note-taking apps provide the graph view functionality basing on Luhmann-style IDs and his keyword index——And this is why I created a new Obsidian plugin \"zettelkasten navigation\" recently. I think this plugin , in some ways, represents the real Luhmann way to retrive thoughts and navigate notes in a digital zettelkasten. The other note-taking apps should provide the similar functionality as well in future.\nShowcase:",
