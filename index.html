                              <span>We are glad to announce streamly 0.9.0 release. streamly-0.9.0 and streamly-core-0.1.0 have been available on Hackage for some time now, you can find reference documentation and some guides on https://streamly.composewell.com as well. The website also has functionality to search across multiple streamly packages.
 This release did a major revamp of the API to make it easier to comprehend and less error prone to use. Now there is a single &quot;Stream&quot; type instead of the polymorphic &quot;IsStream&quot; type class. There are explicit concurrency combinators to enable concurrent behavior on the same type instead of using different types for that purpose.
 Dependency on GHC rewrite rules has been removed for more robust behavior and better programmer control, though it required splitting the stream type into the default direct-style type &quot;Stream&quot; and the CPS type &quot;StreamK&quot;.
 The package has been split into two, streamly-core intends to depend only on boot libraries (currently has some more deps due to backward compatibility), streamly provides higher level functionality like concurrency.
 Parser functionality has been released. Parsers fuse with streams and are compatible with folds i.e. parsers are folds with more power.
 See the following docs for more details:

                              <span>Hi, Im a haskell beginner and as of now just coding some really basic stuff and trying to develop a familiarity with the language. So I wanted to write the haskell equivalent of the intentionally wrongly written fibonnaci code below and I realised I just probably...can&#x27;t?
 void fib (int a, int b, int n) {
 if( n &lt;&#x3D; 0) return;
 if(b &lt;&#x3D; 0 ){
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, a);
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, b + 1);
 fib (a, b + 1, n-2);
 } 
 //bruh block
 int c &#x3D; a + b;
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, c);
 fib (b, c, n - 1 );
 } 
 int main( ) {
 fib( 0, 0, 5); 
 }
 in this code, i&#x27;ve intentionally left the bruh block of code independent of the block above,i.e., not bind it to the previous if block using an else and that obviosuly produces a output different from the expected fibonacci one. I tried building the haskell equiavlent using guards and if-else-thens and in the process i realised there&#x27;s probably no way to build a freely floating independent block of code in a function that has other conditionals in haskell???....Or is there a way to do it?

                              <span>Rustic defines its own mode but I don&#x27;t want to use their functions (rustic-compile and rustic-recompile). I tried to wrap compile in my own function (after I&#x27;ve exported rustic-compilation-mode):
 (defun my/compile (command &amp;optional comint) (let ((compilation-mode rustic-compilation-mode)) (compile command comint))) 
 (consider that I&#x27;ve put interactive where needed etc).
 The function works but the mode is compilation-mode, not rustic-compilation-mode. If I M-x rustic-compilation-mode inside this buffer the proper mode is loaded and I can navigate through errors.
 Is there a way to change the major mode of a compilation buffer without having to set it manually after the compilation has ended?

                              <span>I moved to eglot and so far so good, the only thing a bit annoying is when doing a eglot-rename it doesn&#x27;t show the symbol about to be renamed in the initial input. 
 Usually when I do a rename is not to type a complete new symbol but to actually tweak the name, so currently have to do a bunch of M-/ to get it and then tweak it...
 Maybe that&#x27;s not the behavior people expect and rather have a blank initial input ?
 It&#x27;s easy to override the function directly:
 (defun eglot-rename (newname) &quot;Rename the current symbol to NEWNAME.&quot; (interactive (list (read-from-minibuffer (format &quot;Rename &#x60;%s&#x27; to: &quot; (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;unknown symbol&quot;)) (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;&quot;) nil nil nil (symbol-name (symbol-at-point))))) (eglot--server-capable-or-lose :renameProvider) (eglot--apply-workspace-edit (jsonrpc-request (eglot--current-server-or-lose) :textDocument/rename &#x60;(,@(eglot--TextDocumentPositionParams) :newName ,newname)) current-prefix-arg)) 
 wandering if there is a better way to do this (with advice?) than overriding ?
 maybe i should just ask it nicely to the eglot maintainer?

                              <span>Tweagers have an engineering mantra — Functional. Typed. Immutable. —
that begets composable software which can be reasoned about and avails
itself to static analysis. These are all “good things” for building
robust software, which inevitably lead us to using languages such as
Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
Last time I wrote about how we can use Python’s1
abstract base classes to express useful concepts and primitives that are
common in functional programming languages. In this final episode, I’ll
cover testing strategies that can be learnt from functional programming
and applied to your Python code.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but apparently when you use the VSCode Neovim plugin, you are actually running Neovim in the backend, so it allows you to do most of Neovim stuff there.
 Can we do the same with emacs? Even if it has a bunch of limits in what we can use, it would be nice to be able to use at least some of emacs stuff (in the very least the keybindings) when you have to use something else for emacs.
 For instance, I would absolutely love if I could use emacs in the backend when I&#x27;m working in collaborative Google Docs.
 Is that possible?

 Is it possible for a macro to know file and line location of where it is expanded?

 ​
 So, started wanting to do everything inside emacs so I configured my &#x60;.emacs&#x60; file so I can read my email and chat on slack. I also started browsing the web with emacs. just simple stuff. but the idea is that when im programming i can do all this during my breaks. 
 i wanted to hear other experiences and learn about how others live inside emacs. so please share!

                              <span>I usually use web-mode for, well, web stuff. 
 But if I open or create a jsx file in web-mode, the syntax coloring is horrible.
 If I switch to js2-mode or js-mode, the coloring is just as bad. 
 What are you guys using to make your jsx files readable?

 Before I go ahead and install Aspell, are there any other options I should be aware of?

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;m trying to implement IJKL movement in Emacs. This means: - M-ijkl for movement - C-M-ijkl for forward/backward word &amp; up/down paragraph - with SHIFT for selection - there are other details but they are probably irrelevant here
 I&#x27;ve stumbled on problem after problem with the C-M-i keybind, which I&#x27;d like to have set as &#x27;backward-paragraph, and finally discovered that C-M-i is a literal equivalent to TAB.
 How can I separate these two? It&#x27;s not the most essential keybind in the world but I&#x27;d like to have it because it makes sense to me.

 (https://gitlab.com/john-orford/micrograd/-/blob/master/MoonExample.hs)
 Yesterday, I started running it in GHCI while debugging / testing etc.
 And I noticed, if I don&#x27;t reload before running, it runs and completes almost instantly.
 Unsure how useful this is in the grand scheme of things, but it&#x27;s quite nifty.
 Does GHCI memoise or something?

                              <span>Hi,
 I started to use lxc container for development (to avoid the lot of development library on my host computer.).
 I use it with vscode + remote plugin but sometimes it is freezing / slowing.
 The lxc is running on my laptop so network is not problem.
 I can use console editor inside in the container but with vscode remote seemed okay and very easy setup at the first time.
 I found this slowness when I use git operations, the type info and intellisense working well.
 I was surprised because it is a POC not a big project.
 What is you experience with this configuration ?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been using Scala on the backend for a many years and like many of us, I use Future for concurrency.
 But, I&#x27;m trying to understand why would I use Future in ScalaJS (just started learning) with JS being single threaded.
 One use-case I found is:
 I wrote a test website in ScalaJS with two links using ScalaTags. Each link/page randomly does a heavy computation and then renders a simple but very long HTML. I want to display a spinner when I click on either of the hyperlinks, until the computation ends and the dom is rendered. Without Future, on clicking either of the hyperlinks the page takes a while to update the dom, it kinda halts the browser, and then it renders my big azz ScalaTags HTML. The spinner does not get displayed (I toggle between display &#x3D; none &amp; display &#x3D; block).
 But, when I set the dom to display the spinner in a Future, and then call the render function in another Future for the page clicked using QueueExecutionContext, now, I can see the spinner. 
 Kinda weird! JS is still single threaded so why would the use of Future result in different behavior?
 Does this also mean that I should be using Future whenever I&#x27;m updating the dom?

                              <span>Could anybody share a simple and efficient (not 0(N2) memory) implementation for showing minimal edits between two strings?
 It probably should be something like Wagner-Fisher algorithm...
 What I am looking for (and hope to avoid implementing it myself:) is something that given two strings would produce a minimal EditedString:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell type EditedString &#x3D; [EditedChar]
 -- Nothing for unchanged characters, True for added, and False for deleted data EditedChar &#x3D; EditedChar {char :: Char, added :: Maybe Bool} 
 -- the required edits to convert the first string to the second editedString :: String -&gt; String -&gt; EditedString &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 We&#x27;ve just released a v5.1 of SimpleX Chat with message editing history among other things (a shameless promo plug), and I really want to see what actually changed in them...
 Disclaimer: I did try to get it out of ChatGPT4, but no much luck...

 As the older programmers retire it becomes a very serious issue.

 alias &#x27;recent &quot;ls -lrt&quot; 
 But that won&#x27;t help me on Windows. When on Windows I&#x27;d like to map it to the powershell equivalent instead, but I&#x27;m not sure how to get it to work in the alias (or profile) file. I&#x27;ve tried variations of this
 (cond ((eq system-type &#x27;windows-nt) (alias &#x27;recent &quot;Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending&quot;)) ((or (eq system-type &#x27;gnu/linux) (eq system-type &#x27;darwin)) alias &#x27;recent &quot;ls -lrt&quot;)) 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work. Does anyone know how to achieve this in Eshell?

                              <span>Hi! 
 I&#x27;m having a problem in installing the ess-18.10.2 in the emacs-28.2. The problem is related to 
 &quot;Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2&quot;
 and occur in a lot of files. I traced to ess-r-package.el, in the line:
 (define-obsolete-function-alias &#x27;ess-r-devtools-check-package-buildwin &#x27;ess-r-devtools-check-with-winbuilder)
 This seems to be only code line with the problem. The other occurencies of the error are in the &quot;require&quot; statement. 
 The funniest thing is that the problem occurs only in my laptop. I have a desktop with exactly the same software configuration (ess-18.10.2, emacs-28.2, OpenSuse Tumbleweed) and this pack works fine. (in both cases I downloaded the tar.gz from emacs and compiled manualy).
 Someone has any ideia of why it happens? I really can&#x27;t remenber if I made something different in the desktop installation.

                              <span>So, I created this little something called orgish https://github.com/ChanderG/orgish which allows you to manage an org file as a comment embedded inside its own exported html output.
 The idea is to enable use of org to create one-off/standalone html pages - removing the headache of managing 2 files. Just work with a single html file that you can throw onto a static file server.

                              <span>I would greatly appreciate help with trying to install htmlz-mode package - it&#x27;s a very simple package - single htmlz.el file that needs to be evaluated. That&#x27;s it.
 For some reason this (Doom) emacs macro (using straight.el) won&#x27;t work:
 (package! htmlz-mode :recipe (:host github :repo &quot;0xekez/htmlz-mode&quot;)) 
 What does straight.el needs to simply evaluate this damn file on start or when entering &quot;web-mode&quot;?
 I imagine that the author of htmlz-mode haven&#x27;t looked for a way to &quot;properly&quot; package it, but given how complex looking for information on emacs is I can&#x27;t blame him. 
 Is there no way to simply collect tracelog from emacs? Why are there no warnings that it didn&#x27;t evaluate the file? Where would you look for logs? How do you troubleshoot emacs? How do you call this thing &quot;self-documenting&quot; when I experienced the worst documentation out of any open-source tools out there on that user-scale.

                              <span>For me, one thing that is important other than the technical aspects (and Emacs most certainly helps me to work faster and more efficiently on my novels) is the question of self-motivation. To help me with that, I have made a little function that shows me the current progress I have made today when I press s-#.
 It even has a &quot;graphical&quot; aspect to it, the color changes bit by bit from gray to green, and it simulates a &quot;bar&quot; that fills up. The number of characters/pages needed for my daily goal to be done is in a variable I have in my init file.
 I am sorry I opened a new thread, I wanted to post this in the thread &quot;Emacs for literature&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know how to post a picture in an answer to thread. So here is the Minibuffer a few times during the day, to give you some idea of what I mean.
 It is in German, the translation would be: 92.791 characters, 30 pages, equals 56 percent [today new: 0/2] Current page 93 percent, scene 1 page, chapter 1 page.
 In the modeline, I also show what &quot;page&quot; I am on. It just divides the length of the Buffer through the average number of characters on a standard page (3000 characters). Must seem like a very un-Emacsy way of doing things to you, but it helps me to get a feeling of getting things done somehow. :)

                              <span>Before my emacs days, I used nvim with this package called indentLine. Basically it displays (maybe semi-transparent?) vertical lines for same indentation levels . It&#x27;s visually helpful when I&#x27;m in long python code.
 Check these images from this repo: - img1 - img2
 ...
 Is there any alternative to this package (or built-in function) in emacs?

                              <span>I sometimes write markdown documents in which I want to quickly add some python code. Maybe this is the readme of a python project on github, or its a quick blog post that will be processed by my static site generator.
 I know there are million projects along these lines, and many very complex, but I threw my own dead simple one: markdown-notebook minor mode.
  
Load the code.
 Open a markdown document and load the minor mode.
 If you press C-c b it creates a markdown python code block.
 If you press C-c C-c inside a python code block, it sends it to a python shell, and pastes the results back into a blank code block right after the python code block.
 C-c C-x will restart the shell, in case you want to start fresh.
  
Please free to use. Any simple improvements are welcome.

Has anything changed between the versions that can explain this behaviour? I haven&#x27;t found any relevant information saying so.

                              <span>I am seeing this weird behaviour. When I start emacs, internal links work as expected: I have a table of contents (created with org-toc) and I can jump from the entry in the TOC to the headline with simply typing return.
 But at some point (and I have been unable to find out what triggers it) when typing return on an internal link I am asked to provide a tags table: &quot;Visit tags table (defaults TAGs): ...&quot;. 
  
Does anybody know if visiting a tags table is expected org behaviour? I traced the code to the best of my abilities and I see that org-link-open is being executed.
 Does anybody know how to inhibit the &quot;visit tags table&quot; behaviour?
  
I do have many packages installed (emacs-prelude) so it might be something else. I tried to use the debugger, but failed to understand how to use it.
 thank you in advance for any hints/ideas.

                              <span>This post is a continuation of the discussion found here: [Link to Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/13guvo3/should_i_go_with_scala_or/), and I would like to share my conclusions.
 ​
 I am thrilled to embark on a journey with Scala and dedicate a significant amount of time to writing projects, starting with my personal blog/portfolio. However, I do have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with:
 ​
 1) What technology stack should I consider?
 ​
 After careful consideration, I have made the decision to use tapir and http4s for my projects. However, I am currently torn between ZIO and Cats. Personally, I am leaning towards ZIO as it seems to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly effect system. Nevertheless, I am aware that Typelevel/Cats is more widely adopted in the industry. Could you please advise me on which one has a greater demand in the market?
 ​
 2) Is it necessary for newcomers to have knowledge of Akka?
 ​
 I have some experience with GraphQL and have been exposed to RPC-like concepts and classic MVC patterns. However, I feel hesitant about diving into actors, as they remind me of the unnecessary complexity I encountered with redux-saga. Would it be mandatory for me to learn Akka for my first few projects, or can I initially focus on other aspects?
 ​
 Thank you in advance for your assistance!
 ​
 P.S. #1 I would greatly appreciate it if you could also recommend any helpful materials such as books or project ideas to aid me on this journey.
 ​
 P.S. #2 As a more serious and long-term project idea, I am considering developing a &quot;Job Aggregator (Scraper)&quot; or a &quot;Job Board.&quot; Personally, I lean towards the first variant as it aligns more with data processing, and I am eager to spend time designing a system that can scrape data in real-time and notify subscribers. 
 P.S. #3 I would like to extend my appreciation to ChatGPT for its assistance in crafting this beautifully written post in English.

                              <span>I apologize if this question has been asked, but I can&#x27;t find a solution or an explanation online.
 I&#x27;m writing a compiler, and have the following definitions in order to get a more organized pattern matching when I&#x27;m messing with the AST: haskell data WYType &#x3D; WYNum | WYArray | WYString | WYBool data Token &#x3D; Identifier | WYType | ... 
 What confuses me is that the compiler doesn&#x27;t recognize WYNum/WYArray/WYString/WYBool as a Token. I feel like mathematically is possible. Shouldn&#x27;t a | (b | c) | d &#x3D; a | b | c | d?
 Thank you for your answer!
 Edit: for more context, this is the error message I get from my Alex file:  • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘WYType’ with ‘Token’ Expected: String -&gt; Token Actual: String -&gt; WYType • In the expression: alex_action_7 In the expression: (1, alex_action_7) In the second argument of ‘array’, namely ‘[(5, alex_action_3), (4, alex_action_4), (3, alex_action_5), (2, alex_action_6), ....]’  The corresponding section of Lexer.x: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; tokens: :- 「([\s\「]+)」 { \s -&gt; Identifier s }  數 { _ -&gt; WYNum }
 { data WYType &#x3D; WYNum | WYArray | WYString | WYBool
 data Token &#x3D; Identifier String | WYType -- More definitions... } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>I am looking for a way to represent an AST with metadata (such as source location info, types, etc). My first attempt at this was making the AST a functor over the metadata type:
 data AST m &#x3D; Apply m (AST m) (AST m) | Var m Symbol | ... 
 or when the AST consists of multiple types:
 data Expression m &#x3D; Apply m (AST m) (AST m) | Var m Symbol | ... data TopLevel m &#x3D; Assign m Symbol (Expression m) | ... 
 But this gets harder and more annoying if I want to have a different type of metadata for the different types in the AST. I then heard about the Fix type constructor:
 data Fix f &#x3D; Fix (f (Fix f)) 
 which allows you to generalize a recursive type, and you can add metadata by making a product with the Const functor. This still has the problem with representing an AST with multiple types, so …</span>

                              <span>Hej fellows!
 When writing my diary, I find myself regularly using C-l in order to recenter-top-bottom until the current line vertically centered.
 Then, I realized that Id love to have a solution that is less manual than automatic.
 I know about centered-cursor-mode, and while it is already better than the default behavior, I am still not satisfied: I literally want point to stay -- in a particular buffer -- in the vertical center, at all times.
 Do you happen to know a package that achieves this?
 Thanks, have a good day!

 However, I was trying to figure out how to use this in vanilla emacs but it does not work since I get the error symbols function definition is void: map! 
 Is there a way to port this to vanilla emacs?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Long time lurking, finally brave enough to ask for help.
 I recently switch from ivy to vertico, corfu and embark. 
 I&#x27;m having issue when corfu-popupinfo kicks in during the autocomplete. It get stuck and can&#x27;t move to the next option. I have searched if someone had the similar bug in github for vertico and corfu but looks like no one is mentioning about. I think at this point, I started to believe something is wrong with my configuration or it&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t work well together. Here a screenshot showing. Also I&#x27;m sharing my configuration and the error message I&#x27;m getting from corfu. I&#x27;m using only lsp-mode without the lsp-ui.
 any tips to help where this bug can come from?
 ​
 Thank you in advance for all the advice&#x27;s and help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen this Vim badge on some older sites and I would like to put it on my websites too. There&#x27;s just one problem: I switched to Emacs a few months ago and I don&#x27;t want to switch back to Vim just to use this badge. Was there ever a similar Emacs badge?

                              <span>Hi fellow r/emacs ers, I am struggling to reduce the size of the fonts my configuration. I have based it on nano-emacs, I am using the variable  nano-font-size but the font size does not change.
 Is there a fonction in emacs to find in the config where a variable is set?
 When I call  describe-char I can read the name of the font and a parameter with the value 19... I see this value nowhere in my config, and I have difficulties following the logic between font size (ex: 12), or points (120)...
 I do not know how to describe it better...
 Any help is welcome, how to set once and for all the right size for my font.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a quick blog post about the elfeed-webkit package I just published to MELPA.
 It provides a lightweight integration of the elfeed web feed reader with Emacs&#x27; support for embedding webkit widgets, and allows for browsing a feed entry&#x27;s source link right within Emacs, without leaving the context of elfeed.
 Webkit rendering can be toggled on/off manually, or automatically based on an entry’s tags.
 This might be interesting for you if you use elfeed and are subscribed to feeds that don&#x27;t render well as text.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently writing literature in Emacs because I find it much more comfortable, fast, and intuitive compared to traditional text processors. I have been customizing my workspace to create a more aesthetically pleasing environment, although I must admit that I am not an expert in elisp programming, so my attempts have been relatively simple.
 ​
 I am generally satisfied with the outcome so far. However, I would greatly appreciate it if those of you who also use Emacs for writing literature could share any additional tools or suggestions that have proven useful in your own writing processes. I believe that your insights could potentially benefit me as well. Thank you in advance!

 Now you can remove any package prefix and write,
 (bind (my-window-map (:prefix &quot;m&quot; (:repeat &quot;h&quot; #&#x27;windmove-left &quot;j&quot; #&#x27;windmove-down &quot;k&quot; #&#x27;windmove-up &quot;l&quot; #&#x27;windmove-right) &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;delete-window &quot;D&quot; #&#x27;delete-other-windows)) ((:global-map) &quot;w&quot; my-window-map)) 
 in bind block instead of fully typing bind-prefix, bind-repeat, bind-global-map etc.

 My problem is that I need a working tex environment for exporting this.
 Is there a way to directly express math in MathML in an org file avoiding the use of tex?
 ​
 btw: This is not about pro and cons of *tex. I&#x27;m a heavy *tex user and know how it works and how to set it up.

                              <span>Hi, so for example I have the key combination C-c C-x set up to open neotree and it works fine, however in certain modes (e.g. inferior lisp mode), I suppose that there are longer key combinations that seem to start with my combination for neotree, because when I type it, it shows &quot;C-c C-x-&quot; in the status bar as if it were waiting for me to input more keys 
 Is there some on the go way I can have it accept C-c C-x as the whole input? there are other cases like this one and I&#x27;d like to know the way to have it accept the shorter key combinations defined when I&#x27;m finished typing them

                              <span>This week my novel »Der letzte Auftrag« climbed to 11th place on the bestseller list in Germany. Planned and written completely in Emacs, with the help of Orgmode, Olivetti, and you guys here at Reddit. Thank you so much!
 https://preview.redd.it/h65k41u1j51b1.png?width&#x3D;1063&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;v&#x3D;enabled&amp;s&#x3D;d0e2a4f014fac06722ea13df2624f842f6a14329
 My website as a writer is (after the old typo3-setup has broken down) is also done via Emacs, it is all static HTML now, but better for viewing with the smartphone than my old page. I tangle the website out of Orgmode into HTML files. If you are interested, the english version, which is somewhat outdated though, is www.titusmueller.de/index_en.html. I need to get the German content translated and bring it up to date.
 Then there is the Agenda for my reading tour through many cities, my e-mails via Mu4e ... You get it: I am hooked. Thank you for making it such a joy even for a non-programmer to use Emacs!

                              <span>Hi, I want to do the following in dired mode: if the object at point is an org-roam file, rename it (move it). However, I want the function to return to the dired buffer after it has done its work. I know I should use save-excursion, however, I am not able to understand how I can combine it with org-roam-buffer-p. Any ideas or help would be awesome. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m really excited to announce the release of Ogma 1.0.9!
 Ogma is a NASA tool that facilitates integrating runtime monitors or runtime verification applications into other systems.
 Use cases supported by Ogma include producing Robot Operating System (ROS 2) packages [3], NASA Core Flight System (cFS) applications [4], and components for FPrime [1] (the software framework used for the Mars Helicopter), as well as generating monitors from requirements specified in natural language [5]. Ogma is also one of the solutions recommended for monitoring in Space ROS applications [2].
 Ogma leverages existing Haskell work, like the Copilot language [6] (also funded by NASA) and BNFC [7].
 For more details, including videos of monitors being generated and flown in simulators, see: http…</span>

                              <span>This year, Google did not select Haskell as an open-source project for the Google Summer of Code program. In line with tradition, the Haskell community stepped up, with multiple individuals, companies, and non-profit organizations funding nine significant open-source contributions to the Haskell ecosystem:
  
Cabal file support for HLS
 Implement Resolution Methods in HLS
 Goto Definition for Third-Party Libraries in HLS
 Teaching Weeder About Type Class Instances
 Standardize GHC’s Error Dump in JSON Format
 Maximally Decoupling Haddock and GHC
 Representing Pattern
 Improving Calligraphy
 Structured Errors and Error Codes for cabal-install
  
For more details about the accepted projects, the participants, and the mentors, see this announcement: https://summer.haskell.org/news/2023-05-14-summer-of-haskell-2023-project-selections.html
 We would like to thank the sponsors who made this possible:
  
The Haskell Foundation

 I&#x27;ve a basic jsaddle project with reflex-dom calculator sample.
 It&#x27;s working well with chrome but freezing with firefox.
 I read about that the jsaddle not working with firefox because the lacking of ~sync xhr request ... I would like to change my angular+Haskell Backend concept... Do you have experience with it ?
 Question 2: maybe Elm is a better choice?

I&#x27;ve released the pressure cooker steam that I put myself in by taking a graduate-level writing seminar on food. since the class ended, the floodgates burst, doubling the time spent in the garden of my ZK. Some of my structure and sub-hub notes have gotten large, and I find I&#x27;m looking at refactoring them. Thinking about structure note size, I&#x27;m not sure smaller is better in the age of fast search. I have a bunch of search tools/extensions that help focus link creation and finding stuff for the output side of zettelkasting. A technique I&#x27;m stealing from someone on the forums is when placing a note on a structure note to look closer at links already on the structure note for link candidates. The fact that they are placed in a particular section of a structure note means the note is surrounded by ideas that relate. Or maybe I can figure out a way to link to a section of structure notes. (I already have a method of linking to a specific place in a note but don&#x27;t use it in this workflow.)
Python programming continues to be exciting, and having a large collection of notes as a playground has been fruitful. I&#x27;ve expanded &quot;Idea Explorer&quot; to provide more information about a note thread. It now has tabs for the &quot;Tag Map&quot; and a tab with all the one-sentence summaries of the notes listed together.  I continue to work with trending for my ZK dashboard. Part of which is behind &quot;My Ten-day Zettel Production.&quot;
Once again, writing precedes my thinking.

 I want to version control my bookmarks to share them between machines, but these extra marks that get created automatically seem to get in the way.
 Do y&#x27;alls know of a way to disable the creation of those bookmarks without altering the source, and/or can you think of a workaround for version controlling and sharing bookmarks between my machines without constantly having changes to the file present that I did not make?
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>I started work on this theme called &quot;Cacao&quot;. I do tech su pport work during the day and happen to reverse colors on an image and got a very pleasing set of colors and decided to try it on EXWM (Emacs window manager). It&#x27;s still a work in progress, but I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to get a few opinions as it&#x27;s more or less up and running!
 Feel free to let me know whether it&#x27;s good, bad or indifferent. I&#x27;m pretty thick skinned :) .

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;m running Gentoo and using EXWM.
 I&#x27;m trying to set it up so that startx launches emacsclient. I start the server with emacs --daemon --eval &quot;(require &#x27;exwm)&quot; -f exwm-enable (I&#x27;ve tried running this both from TTY and from within .xinitrc). In .xinitrc I start emacsclient with exec emacsclient -c.
 Once I&#x27;ve started the server and run startx, Emacs works perfectly the first time. But if I exit with C-x C-C (or switch to TTY2 and killall emacsclient) and run startx a second time, Emacs freezes and the frame shows up smaller and in the top-left corner of the screen.
 If it helps here&#x27;s my .xinitrc:
 # Disable access control for the current user xhost +SI:localuser:$USER # Make Java applications aware this is a non-reparenting window manager export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING&#x3D;1 # Set default cursor xsetroot -cursor_name XC_crosshair # Set keyboard repeat rate xset r rate 200 60 # Start emacs # emacs --daemon --eval &quot;(require &#x27;exwm)&quot; -f exwm-enable exec emacsclient -c 
 And here&#x27;s the relevant bit of my init.el:
 (use-package exwm :straight t :config (require &#x27;exwm-config) (setq exwm-workspace-number 1) (exwm-enable)) 
 Also there&#x27;s this in early-init.el that might be relevant but I doubt it:
 (push &#x27;(fullscreen . maximized) initial-frame-alist) (push &#x27;(ns-transparent-titlebar . t) default-frame-alist) (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t frame-resize-pixelwise t) 
 How can I find out what&#x27;s causing the issue? I just can&#x27;t understand why it works the first time but not the second time.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I regularly swap between Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. Sometimes I have internet, sometimes I&#x27;m on a vpn that blocks package downloads, and sometimes I don&#x27;t have access to internet at all. This makes it difficult to download and install the Emacs packages I normally use through melpa and elpa. I&#x27;d like to version control my .emacs.d for when I have internet access, and keep it on a thumbdrive when I don&#x27;t. 
 But I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the best way to go about this is portably. Do I just 
  
Create a folder called offline-packages
 Download each package I use from git
 add this line to my .emacs.d? (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/offline-packages/my_package&quot;)
  
(require &#x27;my_package)
 Can I just do git add elpaand just commit the entire folder under version control? If I do this on my Windows PC will the .elc files work on my macOS or Linux pc? If not how do I handle the recompilation? How have other people approached this?

                              <span>TLDR: side windows are awesome, you should use them.
 A while ago I posted https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12jfsan/fixed_window_layout_like_cedet/ and got a reference to https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager - and that has been life-changing. I&#x27;ve ordered the book purely to appreciate the insights in this article. I&#x27;m of course convinced I will find a lot of good stuff in it, but I haven&#x27;t even began digging into it. But I did create the following little snippet that has in the last 24h already improved my quality of life significantly:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t) ;; Introduce a bottom side window that catches ;; compilations, deadgreps etc. (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x27;(&quot;\deadgrep.\|\Compilation\&quot; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . 0) (window-parameters (no-delete-other-windows . t))))
 (defun deets/side-window-resize (enlarge) (let ((bottom-windows (window-at-side-list (window-normalize-frame nil) &#x27;bottom))) (dolist (window bottom-windows) (when (symbolp (window-parameter window &#x27;window-side)) (if enlarge (window-resize window (window-height window)) (window-resize window (- (/ (window-height window) 2))))))))
 (defun deets/side-window-toggle (arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (cond ((null arg) (window-toggle-side-windows)) ((listp arg) (deets/side-window-resize t)) ((symbolp arg) (deets/side-window-resize nil))))
 ;; Remove our side-windows (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro &quot;C-x w&quot;) &#x27;deets/side-window-toggle) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When compiling or grepping, the window is placed a the bottom. I can quickly enlarge/shrink the window, and toggle it. Very happy with this, and I&#x27;m already thinking about further improvements.

 However, only &quot;(setq org-image-actual-width 500)&quot; works, &quot;(setq org-image-actual-height 300)&quot; did nothing to images.
 is it possbile set org image&#x27;s max size as it does markdown mode:
 (setq markdown-max-image-size &#x27;(500 . 300))

Upon hitting Meta+Right, the Emacs frame tiles perfectly onto the right half, but after hitting M-x, Emacs resizes itself, presumably to be multiples of the font, leaving ugly gaps on the edges of the display.
 I&#x27;ve tried (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t) (with Emacs 28.2 without init files) from the Frame Size section of the manual, but the problem remains. Is there a solution to this?

 Version 0.3 has two significant changes: inline commands, and Logseq syncing.
 Inline commands are commands that are embedded in the text and, when viewed in the &#x60;ekg-notes-mode&#x60;, replaces itself with a calculated output. Right now there are commands included in ekg that are related to transclusions, so you can now just include the text of a note, a file, or a webpage, in a note. But you can also write your own inline commands to do whatever you want.
 There are also inline commands related to the current note you can use, where the various types a note can have can output a text representation of the da…</span>

                              <span>Our school has an enforced linter called assai it is a simple script that can be installed in $PATH and be called by doing assai filename the error messages look like as follows:  file_name:linenumber: ERROR: error_message file_name:linenumber: WARNING: error_message  So I figured I could integrate it with flymake by using the annotated flymake-backend example as a guide. So I made the following regex parsers for the error codes.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (defvar flymake-assai--message-regexp (rx bol (group (+? nonl)) &quot;:&quot; (group (+? num)) &quot;:&quot;; file name:line: (+ space) (group (or &quot;error&quot; &quot;warning&quot;)) ; type ) &quot;Regexp to match assai messages.&quot;)
 (defun flymake-assai--parse-assai-message (line) &quot;Parse a assai message from LINE.&quot; (when (string-match flymake-assai--message-regexp line) (let ((file-name (match-string 1 line)) (line-number (string-to-number (match-string 2 line))) (type (match-string 3 line)) (message (substring line (+ (match-end 3) 2)))) &#x60;(:file-name ,file-name :line-number ,line-number :type ,type :message ,message))))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 My question is how can I use the regex parsers as a backend for flymake because the annotated example calls the checker on the current buffer but I can not do that because the script can only be run on a file with a valid file name.
 The annotated example mentioned above can be found on https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs//manual/html_node/flymake/An-annotated-example-backend.html

                              <span>Dear Fellow Scala Enthusiasts!
 I&#x27;m pleased to announce that Tyrian 0.7.0 has just been released. 🚀
 Tyrian is a Scala 3, Elm-like frontend web framework for Scala.js, and I&#x27;m particularly excited about this release. There&#x27;s only a few real changes in it, but they&#x27;re good ones! ...some of them are also quite fundamental to how Tyrian works, so please report any problems or come and say hello on our Discord server if anything looks odd: https://discord.gg/b5CD47g 😅
 First, one of the most requested features has finally been implemented: Tyrian now has frontend routing as standard. You can now make multi-page SPA&#x27;s with minimal fuss.
 Second, Tyrian&#x27;s tiny runtime has been completely rewritten, resulting in super snappy start up times, and better performance than ever thanks to the wizards behind Cats Effect 3.5. (Please don&#x27;t forget that Tyrian works equally well with both CE and ZIO.)
 Third, another oft requested feature: You can now start Tyrian apps just by embedding the script in a page. No more launching via JavaScript if you don&#x27;t want to!
 Finally, a small but welcome usability improvement around our CSS property naming. Properties are now available in &#x60;camelCase&#x60; as well as their original &#x60;kebab-case&#x60;.
 Full details are in the release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.7.0
 All examples and Tyrian&#x27;s g8 template have been brought up to date, the docs site will probably lag behind a bit as usual. 😬
 I hope you give it a go, and don&#x27;t be shy about hoping onto our Discord server if you need any help ...or even if you just fancy chatting about frontend dev, game dev, or to generally heap praise on Scala.js.
 Happy routing!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m having an odd issue where VSCode opens multiple instances of the Haskell Language Server and each consumes 1.5GB of RAM and it is slowing my system to a crawl. Any suggestions on what is causing this?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have written DSLs in the past (too many of them) and find that actually Haskell itself would itself be nicer, more versatile and easier as ‘DSL’; limit the DSL by allowing only certain types to be used. 
 Is that possible (guess yes; make your own Prelude)?
 Then I would want to use this to generate code (doesn’t have to be readable; it won’t be human edited or read); instead of writing a lexer, parser etc; is there an easier way, considering the language already has everything available? So I am looking for something I can execute (I can with the first question of this post) and, when happy, generate code. 
 Anything easier/already done besides figuring out how to use the GHC internals to do this? 
 (Usual apologies if this has been asked and answered before, but the search gave me only DSLs and such)

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if Haskell is gaining or losing popularity, because I&#x27;m receiving conflicting signals. On the one hand, technical progress is fantastic: there is IDE support in form of HLS, GHC is having regular and frequent releases and great features (JS and WASM backends). On the other hand, job offers are still scarse (seem even scarsier then they used to be) and we see some companies move away from Haskell (Facebook / Meta?)
 So what is your opinion? Is it winning of losing? And if it is losing the to what language? And why?

 The error temporarily goes away when I refresh the browser, and the changes to the js file are then reflected in the browser. Any subsequent file changes result in the error again.
 How do I set this up properly? Im having no issue with &quot;Live server&quot; in vscode, but I would love to get this working in emacs. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Is there a way to list all interactive functions? Specifically, I want to see what are the interactive functions that a package provides (it uses a specific prefix). Perhaps a variable that holds them?
 The completion of M-x shows the functions I want to enumerate. But I don&#x27;t know how to cut and paste the list that it generates.
 thank you in advance

 I thought it&#x27;s about high time I start polishing Emacs to be able to use it for development from time to time.
 I&#x27;m having a few issues with getting all these components to work together.
 For corfu, cape and lsp-mode I can&#x27;t see to get any completions in a java(-ts)-mode buffer.
 Let&#x27;s start for what I have for completion with corfu, cape and lsp-mode:

 Github: An Explanation of How I Use Emacs
 I wrote it up for the guys in System Crafters because some of them have been asking me for about a year (and Prot too), so I finally did it. The reason is: I&#x27;m not a programmer, so they&#x27;re all curious how and why I use Emacs.
 It&#x27;s a rough draft, I have to revise it already and make it better. But I was told that people here might find it interesting, so I hope that some at least do.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to run Emacs inside a Distrobox container so I can isolate my LaTeX environment and editor from the main OS, but having issues with package-install as it refuses to install some packages or it seems to partially install some (using a standard install from Melpa setup). For example, Auctex seems to work fine, but cdlatex is nowhere to be found, while in the OS install it all simply works. Probably some permissions or paths not being found? Anyway, what kind of extra configuration do I need to do to make this work?

 I use a lxc container for my development. I can use emacs as a console application but I would like to know is there any other solution where I can use graphical emacs. I don&#x27;t want to deploy vnc or xorg to the server.
 Could I use the emacs server to connect the server with emacsclient ?
 Any solution what you use is interesting for me!
 thanks is advance!

                              <span>I get an error with my config, fix it after struggling a lot and then some other random fucking error happens again (mostly it&#x27;s some evil or evil dependent package) after I open emacs after a few days. Why does this even happen?
 I have been using vim with same config from 2 years and it never needs any corrections. 
 And why is emacs so slow when it has many packages that it requires a daemon to be launched first if you want quick access to client? My vim also has tons of packages and it starts almost immediately. 
 You might say why the fuck would I want to even use emacs then? I need this for org-mode. I wrote many of my previous notes in org and even today it feels like org mode is best organising thoughts and also makes it easy to export to other formats. Vim doesn&#x27;t have a good org equivalent.

                              <span>I was trying to find a way to use latex-preview to preview snippets in python code comments for some scientific code I&#x27;m writing, and the cool kids way to do this seems to be using auctex. Unfortunately auctex seems to be a bit fiddly (and maybe is not playing nicely with elpaca, which otherwise I&#x27;m well happy with). 
 Am I missing something or is the basic idea right (auctex and latex-preview) but auctex just doesn&#x27;t play nicely with elpaca or I&#x27;m missing the right incantation?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I was extremely happy with how I could run &quot;pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode&quot; in a buffer with pdf-view and the pdf would then match the color scheme of the current theme. However, after I have messed around and updated packages, this doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Now I just get a black background instead of the background color of the theme. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this?
 I did try to delete all the packages in the elpa-folder and run everything again, but with the same result. There are some warnings during installation/compilation such as &quot;Warning: the function ‘pdf-view-desired-image-size’ is not known to be defined&quot; and a few others. I hope somebody can help or have had similar issues with pdf-tools. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I use markdown and markdown-mode as my personal knowledge base and even for PM. rgrep and - [ ] as TODOs are generally enough.
 When sharing markdown during screencast virtual meetings I usually do
 C-x 4 c - clone-indirect-buffer: create a new view bellow the current view in the same window and moves point to it
 C-x 5 C-o - create a new frame of the currently vising buffer. Manually select it
 C-c C-x C-m - Toggle Markup Hidding of this markdown buffer
 When I screen share in meetings, some less-tech savy people are shied by link syntax, bold, italics, and markup hiding helps. I do my notes in the direct buffer.
 Now to my question: Can I advise the indirect buffer to follow point of the direct buffer?

                              <span>Hi coolest folks on earth, which is the Emacs community,
 ​
 Im using the Orgzly app on Android. Im not super crazy about better syncing, and all. Just want a veyr simple way to read a random org file when I dont have access to my laptop. My Org files locally have multiple nested directories. Some are old and needed rearranging. Orgzly has a strange concept which is NoteBook. Thats not the issue, the real issue is it cant recursively download .org files properly. I use org mode mainly on laptop, so I just cloned my org notes to a new local place, rearrange in a single level folder, and plan to sync it from there. Do you have any better ideas? Or better apps? Any tips like renaming files is also welcome (but prefer not to).
 ​
 picture is output from Linux tree command of my original org notes. And 2nd is Dropbox, which I &quot;leveled out&quot; (not completely done) becoz Orgzly syncs from Dropbox.

 Is it possible to drag local images to markdown file as org-download does to org-mode?
 After years and years and years and years jumping and time-wasting between multiple mobile apps which supoort org-mode, I finally fixed obdian permanantly and determined never invest a second to try any single mobile others.

                              <span>Seeing people publishing their Tic Tac Toe games here, I decided to show my fully functional, documented, local 3D chess game written in Haskell. A quick glance at the software stack and features:
  
Vulkan for the rendering.
 The package effectful to keep the game logic independent from orthogonal aspects like logging, window handling, memory management and debugging.
 The package apecs for the overall game architecture.
 GLTF for importing 3D models from Blender.
 Features include moving pieces, 3D rotation, smooth zooming, a skybox, lighting and jumping knights :-)
  
As you will recognize in the linked repository, the chess game is merely a running example of a larger endeavour: while implementing the game, I separated the reusable parts of the game into separate packages. The result of this process is hagato (Haskell Gamedev Toolkit), a collection of loosely coupled, easily combinable sub-libraries which can be used or ignored as desired, thus allowing developers to select features and technologies at will while remaining in full control of the overall game architecture. It makes use of the new cabal feature which allows one to put multiple public libraries into a single package.
 I published some additional packages on Hackage while implementing the game: apecs-effectful for integrating apecs into effectul, resource-effectful for managing resources in effectful, and chessica which implements the pure chess logic used in the 3D game.
 However, the chess game was just a testbed, to be honest. My overall goal is to use hagato now to implement the game I wanted to build in the first place, but I cannot share any details yet.

                              <span>I have a collection of alternatives that can be run in any order but the probability of success is highly correlated with the previous successful alternative. Is there a library that can help optimize this?
 Ultimately, it would be best if a model could be exported and compiled into the code to reduce the overhead of the optimizer.

                              <span>See https://haskellstack.org/ for installation and upgrade instructions.
 Changes since v2.9.3:
 Behavior changes:
  
Add flag --[no-]-only-local-bin to Stack’s upgrade command for a binary upgrade. If the Stack executable is my-stack, the default is my-stack upgrade --only-local-bin where previously it was, effectively, my-stack upgrade --no-only-local-bin. If the Stack executable is stack, the default is stack upgrade --no-only-local-bin, the same behaviour as previously.
 Use $XDG_CACHE_HOME/stack/ghci-script, rather than /haskell-stack-ghci (where  is the directory yielded by the temporary package’s System.IO.Temp.getCanonicalTemporaryDirectory), as the base location for GHCi script files generated by stack ghci or stack repl. See #5203

                              <span>Hi all,
 I created scala-sbt-codespaces-template — a GitHub repository template for Scala 3 development in GitHub Codespaces. 🙂
 The repository gives you a minimal sbt project, ready to be extended, within a fully-fledged, cloud-based development environment at one click. All you have to do is create a new repository based on this template repository (or alternatively fork it) and click “Create codespace on main”, that’s it.
 Such Codespaces template repositories exist for many languages, but I couldn’t find one for Scala. The repository is so simple and small that I wasn’t sure whether I should even post this here, but maybe it comes in handy for some of you.
 If you do give it a spin, please let me know what you think and what should be improved/added.
 All the best
 Lucas
 EDIT: Following u/BrilliantArmadillo64’s suggestion, I renamed the repo to reflect that it’s sbt-based.

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 I use org-mode (from melpa) daily on macOS Ventura, with very litte other packages (counsel ivy swiper). I’ve been alternating between homebrew’s emacs-plus as well as https://emacsformacosx.com with the same results.
 The specific things I have experienced everyday for some time now:
  
 (the most annoying) Jumping from a calendar entry to the corresponding source tasks works for a while, then appears to continue tuowork but does not jump to the right place. org-lint does not complain about the file structure. Exiting and restarting Emacs fixes the problem.
  org-capture randomly hangs, specifically when using C-c C-q (org-set-tags-command) in the capture window. Killing emacs works and recover-this-file recovers correctly though.
  
I understand that this may be a very specific issue with my configuration, so this is not a rant about org-mode, rather a request for any pointers where or what I should look at.
 Regards, -bd

                              <span>Currently have helm which is doing the same thing that vertico did for me. When in dired mode if I use + to create a new directory I am unable to create for example &quot;dotfiles&quot; in my home directory, instead it says &quot;Cannot create directory /home/jen/.doom.d: files exists&quot; and what I have tried is searching around the describe variables to see if there was something to disable for dired. As well I have tried searching the internet which lead to suggestions of C-Backspace as well as adding a trailing /
 Not sure how I am supposed to create a new directory that does not already exist in dired when there is an autocomplete generated that interferes. I thought it might have been vertico specific but then helm is doing the same. I read how I could disable it for dired mode but how it was not recommended. How should I be doing this.
 I am not using doom, I was but have since started building my own configuration.

                              <span>The documentation isn&#x27;t very helpful here
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Creating-Timestamps.html
 The date/time prompt clearly says &quot;Date+time&quot; so shouldn&#x27;t just hitting enter result in a timestamp with the date and time? I understand I can type the time in manually with &quot;12:35&quot; or something and it will be inputted by is there no feature to automatically insert the current time into the timestamp???
 I am using spacemacs, but I don&#x27;t think that is affecting anything here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a package to integrate Bigcode/Starcoder into Emacs like https://github.com/zerolfx/copilot.el does with Github Copilot.
 (My previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13dlycc/bigcodestarcoder_integration/)
 Instead of the previous approach that just inserts the first fetched response, starhugger can now display previewing overlays and allow switching among a number of suggestions.
 Optionally there&#x27;s also starhugger-mode-auto, to automatically trigger suggestions as you type. But use this mode with caution, as it can result in you being hit by the rate limit even if you have set an access token.

 Mode-line as header-line
 I then tried to transfer the mode-line keymap to the header-line keymap with
 (define-key mode-line-major-mode-keymap [header-line] (lookup-key mode-line-major-mode-keymap [mode-line])) (define-key mode-line-minor-mode-keymap [header-line] (lookup-key mode-line-minor-mode-keymap [mode-line])) 
 This will allow the clicks on major/minor modes in the header line to act like they do in the mode-line.
 But I don&#x27;t want to do this for all the things displayed in the mode-line. Is there a way to bind all the keys bound to [mode-line mouse-1] to [header-line mouse-1] or do I have to find all the elements of my mode-line one by one and do what I did just above?

I&#x27;ve noticed that enabling &#x60;direct-async-process&#x60; as per https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-processes.html makes a lot of things MUCH faster. Notably magit. But some things don&#x27;t work, like vterm, and others hang for seemingly no reason, like compilation-mode. All of this stuff is stable, but slower, with it turned off. Is there a way to selectively turn it on for certain modes? It would be great to just use it in magit for example. Or has anyone noticed ways to make this less flaky overall?

From the day I tried this, I never looked back to using the original LSP again.

                              <span>I have been trying emacs recently, I installed lsp-mode, lsp-ui, and lsp-treeemacs, I am using that with corfu for autocompletion, but overall I feel like the whole thing is slow, autocompletion is slow (it&#x27;s not slow without lsp-mode) the suggestions are irrelevant to what I type sometimes, diagnosis is slow, sometimes the whole interface blocks when I am moving my cursor too fast.
 does anyone experience something similar? or is it just me? I tried neovim&#x27;s lsp features and they are much faster compared to emacs, I would say even vscode is faster. Is this some issue with elisp threading or something?
 ​
 here is my lsp config for reference 
 ;; lsp mode (use-package flycheck :ensure t) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :custom (lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (gc-cons-threshold 100000000) (read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) (lsp-log-io nil) :hook (c-mode . lsp) :commands lsp) (use-package lsp-ui :ensure t :custom (lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil) :commands lsp-ui-mode) (use-package lsp-treemacs :ensure t :commands (lsp-treemacs-symbols lsp-treemacs-errors-list lsp-treemacs-references)) 
 ​
 and this is my corfu config 
 ​

                              <span>Hi, I am still seeking a clean way to get the path to my note, as requested here https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1401/request-some-way-of-getting-note-file-path#latest
To repeat my ask: apart from the current menu entry &quot;Edit &gt; Copy Link To Note&quot;, I request a &quot;Edit &gt; Copy Path to Note&quot;, which will give me enough information, and which will hopefully will be trivial for you to write.
Or, if the path to the archive is stored, perhaps somewhere in ~/Library, I can read from there...
Also, much less critical so feel free to ignore, is there yet a way to programmatically change the current folder?
Many thanks,
  Abhijit</span>

I&#x27;m more interested in comparing different playing &quot;agents&quot; than implementing the game. To that end, I&#x27;ve created a program that lets you select agents and pit them against each other repeatedly.

 I&#x27;m exploring reinforcement learning, and how to optimise the learning agent. Future work includes:

This is different than the super org-file method I&#x27;ve followed, which leverages some excellent narrowing/searching tools to get around.

                              <span>I use emacs, but the main thing I see that vim has going for it is that it starts read-only so you don&#x27;t just type characters by mistake. Is there a simple way to have emacs in read-only, specifically when editing source code, and toggle it on and off with a simple keybinding?
 Something like:
  emacs --eval &#x27;(setq buffer-read-only t)&#x27;  strikes me as a workaround and not a solution. Is the simplest way to just have this as my default emacs startup and define a key-binding to toggle it? How would I do that?

 If this can be done using org-modern, it would be amazing to learn how. Otherwise, if someone knows how to do this with either prettify symbols or some other way that would be great too. Thanks.

 I&#x27;m trying to setup one set of universal keybinding that adapt if I&#x27;m in project or not
 (defun smart-for-files () (interactive) (if (projectile-project-p) (consult-projectile) (find-file default-directory))) (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;smart-for-files) 
 This work properly, the only thing is that find-file open dired instead of the vertico interface that I normally use. Why?I&#x27;m searching for a while but I didn&#x27;t find anything properly related.Is this the right way to do it?
 I thought that calling this with (interactive) will behave as I expeted.
 Thanks
 EDIT: Found the solution my self scavenging like a maniac. The desidered result is obtained using ido-find-file, where (now I kwow) &quot;I&quot; stand for interactive.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn more about whether should I really not rebind it to zooming out.
 Upon some research I determined that for example M--5 C-n works just as well as C-- M-5 C-n (as an useless example just to check).
 ​
 According to chatgpt it is historic and was deemed as a more comfortable way to differentiate between minus as negative operator and as command line argument (like --help).
 Backslashes are used to escape characters such as minus etc. for this CLI functionality instead and chatgpt confirmed this was common before Emacs began this weird thing instead of using backslashes if ever necessary anyway.
 Furthermore, I just found that both M-- and C-- are both bound to negative-argument. So do these two keybindings have different functionality in different contexts, or are they always the same? Because why have two enabled by default? (Maybe for user convenience of different keyboard layouts, but this is a bit too confusing more than necessary, maybe the devs meant to implement keyboard layout detection but failed..?).
 This All may seem dumb to be asking, (like why not just rebind C-- to zoom out and get over with it) but I&#x27;m confused thinking that there probably should be a good reason this is not by default in Emacs yet.
 Maybe I&#x27;m just thinking too highly of the &quot;intelligent design behind Emacs&quot;? I hope not.
 kind Regards.

                              <span>I think I am conservative with the packages I use but nonetheless my modeline is getting out of control. It&#x27;s to long and to verbose.
 I want to retain the modeline (so disabling is not an option)
 What configurations or packages are others using to have a more organized / less obtrusive modeline?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;m very new to Emacs so bear with me..
 I&#x27;ve been using ESS at work to run my R code in Emacs, and it usually works very well (apart from lsp/eglot and flycheck being very slow). However when I run a large amount of R code using polymode-eval-buffer or similar, the code will run, however I will be unable to interact with Emacs the whole time, mousing over Emacs shows the windows loading symbol as my cursor, but doesn&#x27;t say &quot;not responding&quot;. The file isn&#x27;t particularly long, ~800 lines, and if I run it in two halves using polymode-eval-buffer-from-point-to-end or polymode-eval-buffer-from-beg-to-point it works as expected.
 The code takes a long time to run, loading in a couple million spatial points and doing stuff with them, which I&#x27;m sure is the main reason it happens, but running this code in Rstudio doesn&#x27;t freeze it!
 I&#x27;ve read online in various places that setting ess-eval-visibly to nil or nowait solves some peoples issues, but doesn&#x27;t change anything for me...
 Thanks for any help you guys can give!

                              <span>Microsoft Access has a few virtues, like being a desktop app and rather robust in its ability to customize (by Microsoft standards). At its most basic, it will read from and write to a database, usually through Forms that have been customized to display certain information from a database in a certain layout. And because it works with one source of truth (e.g., it can connect to SQL and PostgreSQL databases), multiplayer data entry and collaboration is more feasible than in a purely plain text method being shared by a syncing service.
 The problem is, Microsoft Access is one sin shy of being the devil. It’s proprietary and buggy, and coding in VBA is a nightmare compared to most languages, especially our beloved elisp. Someone said MS Access is the best worst way to make a database program, and I think that sums it up well.
 I know emacs can interface with SQL databases, but are there any packages that try to accomplish something like Microsoft Access, i.e., rapid application development via forms that display and allow editing certain fields from a database? If not, what would be the best practices in building this functionality?

                              <span>In the last year I&#x27;ve started using emacs at work. The language I end up using most is php with the Laravel framework. Laravel implemented a php repl called Tinker that loads the laravel framework and allows the user to interact with it. Where would I begin if I wanted to integrate the same thing with emacs? I know SLIME, et. al. is impossible without a major php rewrite but I&#x27;d like to get as close as possible. I don&#x27;t want just a repl but a buffer where I can send files or selected code to the repl and receive the output in the repl buffer. Is there a good plugin I could maybe learn from in order to write it or does anyone know of one already that I haven&#x27;t been able to find?

 Then it comes to me that a standard mode-line mode provides unnecessary noisy messages such as major mode, file name which I absolutely know.
 How could set it as simple as a black separate line：

 I tried as:
 (setq mode-line-format writeroom-mode-line) ;; the above dispaly the same as the below (setq mode-line-format nil) 
 The mode-line vanished even without a separate line.

                              <span>Philosopher Richard Y. Chappell has written a straightforward and readable Git+Pandoc software setup and workflow guide suitable for academic writing. [Academics don&#x27;t want you to know this secret trick: this free software setup is workable for writers of all kinds.] Professor Chappell&#x27;s guide walks you through the software installation, which includes git for version control, Pandoc for document processing, and the VSCode editor with plugins for Pandoc citations and document export. After the one-time software installation, the writer begins each document with a Markdown template. The Markdown template includes some LaTeX macros for page formatting--Prof Chappell recommends installing the MikTeX LaTeX distribution. Modifying the Pandoc LaTeX template is unnecessary (though I have done this to avoid repetition): add LaTeX packages and macros to the Markdown document template as needed.
The setup is interesting and will get you part of the way to a Zettelkasten with VSCode. The installed software and workflow are compatible with Zettlr and Obsidian, though this requires additional configuration.</span>

                              <span>Funnily enough, not unlike another recent poster here, my first &quot;serious&quot; Haskell project that I recently finished is an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, this time not with a variable board size but an implementation of the minimax algorithm.
 My background is not in OOP but the thing I have been struggling most with in Haskell is file organization (It just never feels &quot;right&quot; to me, not sure why) and just difficulties getting around the tooling but now that I got it set up it just works most of the time.
 Anyways, interested in feedback from experienced Haskell users, especially in code organization and formatting or just general coding tips.
 Also as an added question, after implementing the tree building/traversing functions in Skynet.hs using (un)foldTree instead of explicit recursion, to me atleast, the code doesn&#x27;t seem that much clearer, I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s something that will come with experience or if manual recursion is just the way to go sometimes.

                              <span>Im working through the paper &quot;Structured Handling of Scoped Effects&#x27;&#x27; and on page 13 they introduce an inference rule that looks a lot like Coyoneda, but with two continuations. Translating it into code:
 ​
 data DoubleCoyo : (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Type -&gt; Type
 In : g n -&gt; (n -&gt; p x) -&gt; (x -&gt; p a) -&gt; DoubleCoyo g p a
 ​
 They then say that this is equivalent to a left kan extension Lan Id (Comp g p) (p a), and since Lan Id &#x3D; Coyoneda, this is the same thing as Coyoneda (Comp g p) (p a).
 ​
 However, I am stuck trying to show that the two types are equivalent. Am I on the right track, or did I make a mistake somewhere?

A bit more than one year ago, we released the very first public version Nickel
(0.1). Throughout various
write-ups and public talks
(1,
2,
3), we’ve been telling the
story of our dissatisfaction with the state of configuration management.

The need for a New Deal
Configuration is everywhere. The manifest of a web app, the configuration of an
Apache virtual host, an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) cloud deployment
(Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.).
Configuration is more often than not considered a second-class engineering
discipline, like a side activity of software engineering. That’s a dangerous
mistake: with the advent of IaC for the cloud, configuration has become an
important aspect of modern software systems, and a critical poin…</span>

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 The Scala tooling is a common complain within the community, lately, we have been lucky to get more and better tools, like scala-cli, metals, etc.
 Time ago, I had to do some work with js where I was able to try Vercel/Netlify, those tools are super handy, for example, Vercel allows to deploy js projects that use next.js with minimal effort, also, it provides Preview Environments to each Pull Request, this is something that I really wanted to get in Scala.
 Last year I started building a similar tool (https://codepreview.io), as of now, it only supports Preview Environments, still, different to Vercel, codepreview actually let&#x27;s you try the whole application, imagine a scala backend, scala.js frontend, postgres database, all of them packaged as a temporal app on every Pull Request (with it&#x27;s unique domain).
 It&#x27;s been a few months since we have been using codepreview on internal projects + a few customer projects, so far, the feedback has been good.
 Unfortunately, the project isn&#x27;t as nice as Vercel, it would be lovely to get this installed with a few clicks like Vercel does, instead, I need to do a few manual steps for every project. Besides this, there are also some other improvements to make but I&#x27;m not fully confident on what to prioritize. Which is why I&#x27;m coming here to ask for help.
 My offering is, I&#x27;ll grant a trial/free license to whoever is willing to give codepreview a try, I&#x27;d only ask for feedback, which should help me to prioritize the future work.
 So far, we have been working mainly with projects that use https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager, still, projects building fat jars should also work smoothly.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I used EccoPro back in the day. I installed it on my Win8.1 PC some time ago. I&#x27;m going to be moving to a Win11 laptop and was wondering if I&#x27;ll be able to install it there? Also, what are some mainstream apps into which I can import my EccoPro? It doesn&#x27;t need to have the same outlining functionality. Also would like to use an app that has a mobile app (Android). Thx

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Some context:
 This is simple agenda view where we can select heading for the future bulk action:
 Column mode disabled, marks visible
 I use my special columned agenda view to archive some done headings. (I need columns to see &#x60;CLOSED&#x60; timestamps.)
 I still can mark/unmark items, but I have to do that blindly.
 Column mode enabled, marks invisible
 I&#x27;ve configured it in this way:
 (org-agenda-overriding-columns-format &quot;%CATEGORY %30ITEM %TODO %CLOSED %TAGS&quot;) 
 (I also tried a default column set.)
 Is it a fundamental limitation or a configured feature?

 Customized Definition Jumping: Jump directly to the definition of a specific footnote label with enhanced jumping functionality.
  
Why should you try it? With org-footnote-assistant, you can streamline your workflow, avoid the hassle of constantly navigating between references and definitions, and improve your overall experience when working with footnotes in Org Mode.
 But I need your help! As this is my first Org Mode package, I&#x27;m eager to receive your feedback and external input. Your valuable suggestions and ideas can help enhance and extend the functionality of org-footnote-assistant, making it more user-friendly and robust.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Before anything, i&#x27;d like to let you know that I&#x27;m pretty new to emacs (and loving it). 
 So what I&#x27;m trying to achieve is what title says, develop on a remote machine, I&#x27;m using TRAMP to connect to remote machine, but then I&#x27;ve no &quot;IDE&quot; features like, auto-completion, debugging, executing the code. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried to setup the lsp mode, without success. 
 I&#x27;m really sorry for this noob alike post, but there&#x27;s not much more info I can provide, i&#x27;m kinda lost atm. Is there any chance that you can give me some guidance that I can follow to make it to work? 
 Thanks alot for your time

Or is there a better way to profile Emacs&#x27; start-up woes these days?

emacs is crashing, would you like to open a Debugger?
  
https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/vg4GLXZmLP9q
 When I choose to debug, a stacktrace is written in a locally saved txt file. Why this message and not a warning within emacs (debug on error is set to true) ?
 How can I get rid of it? Thanks for your help,

 Is there a way to hide dates which have no actions in Super agenda mode?
 As I&#x27;m trying to set actions more into the future, I get quite a long list of empty dates before I get to one particular action, which is not ideal

                              <span>hi everybody,
 I wonder... why is using javascript injection NOT a common method to retrieve the URL, title and selection inside a web-page? Here is a simple AppleScript that does that. it would be trivial to write a function that calls this script, parses the output and is used by the user in whichever way wanted.
  #!/usr/bin/env osascript set jsCommand to &quot;console.log( &#x27;get url,title&#x27; );document.URL + &#x27;;;&#x27; + document.title + &#x27;;;&#x27; + window.getSelection().toString();&quot; tell application &quot;Google Chrome&quot; execute front window&#x27;s active tab javascript jsCommand end tell 
 I realize that using AppleScript only works on MacOS. But there must be a way to do it in other platforms. This seems to be a way more practical way to retrieve this info than starting an org-capture from the browser.

                              <span>Observed this in emacs 28.1
 Thought it would be some issue with my config
 ran with emacs -Q, still not opening org files 
 even a new file with C-x C-f filename.org also not opening
 
 Uninstalled and reinstalled emacs 28.2 and tried without config, same behavior
  
It consumed a lot of time, trying to resolve. Did anyone face this? I am with no clue and it is so weird. Am I missing any simple thing? Btw, I started learning emacs recently, only for ORG mode :(
 Edit: Do not know if this is related, I observed this after I started using XMonad window manager. I uninstalled, and installed in GNOME, KDE Plasma DEs also without configuration, but no luck.
 (Org files are opening in Macbook)

                              <span>How can I print symbols in emacs lisp, preserving the quotes?
 For example:
 (prin1-to-string (quote foo)) ;; &quot;foo&quot; (print1-to-string #&#x27;insert) ;; &quot;insert&quot; (prin1-to-string #&#x27;insert nil &#x27;((quoted . t))) ;; &quot;insert&quot; 
 Instead of &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;insert&quot; I would like it to print &quot;&#x27;foo&quot; and &quot;#&#x27;insert&quot;. According to the info manual it seems like it should print the quoting characters, but it does not.
 I am using Emacs 29.0.91 (Emacs 29 2nd pretest).

Should I install a snippet engine such as &quot;tempel&quot; or &quot;yasnippet&quot;?
 Do I need company as I have seen people install it alongside corfu and cape?
  
note: I already have Cape set up, and lsp completions are functioning—they&#x27;re just not expanding.

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;m trying to get my computers to where they&#x27;ll all seamlessly synchronize all my files between them, mostly my PKMS files. I&#x27;m quite new to Emacs and I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m making a mistake here.
 I have a directory &#x60;~/kb/~ which contains all of my notes. Yesterday I set up Syncthing to synchronize that folder between all of my computers. Eventually I&#x27;d like for changed files to auto-reload in Emacs if they&#x27;re open in a buffer, but for now I&#x27;m fine with just synchronizing them and manually reopening them.
 Here&#x27;s the relevant bit of my init.el  (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/kb&quot;)) (org-roam-db-location (concat org-roam-directory &quot;/org-roam.db&quot;)))  As you can see, org-roam.db is stored in ~/kb, which is synchronized. I&#x27;m wondering if this will have any adverse affects?

                              <span>I have the following function:
 (defun wm-focus (direction) (condition-case nil (windmove-do-window-select direction) (error (shell-command (format &quot;sway focus %s&quot; direction) t)))) 
 The problem is, this function does not work initially. I have to create a new window and run evil-window-down or evil-window-up or windmove-up etc, and only then it starts working.
 I have isolated the problem but I do not know how to solve it.
 If I start Emacs daemon and I run this:
 (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down) 
 I get this error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function windmove-do-window-select) (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down) (progn (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down)) eval((progn (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down)) t) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) call-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 But if I do the trick with manual switching of the windows, then the error disappears.
 The funny thing is that I cannot even find (C-h f) the windmove-do-window-select until I perform the manual creation and switching of the windows. But I can find windmove-up. Yet, both functions are declared inside windmove.el.
 What is going on here? :/
 SOLVED: Found the solution on the Emacs wiki:
 https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindMove
 I needed to add this bit to my configuration:
 (when (fboundp &#x27;windmove-default-keybindings) (windmove-default-keybindings)) 
 This adds the default bindings and includes all the functions properly.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using emacs for many years, but I still barely understand it.
 So I apologize in advance if this question is premised on poor understandings of emacs / LSP.
 ​
 Anyway, I&#x27;ve set it up as a web development environment. I&#x27;ve managed to get LSP working for js/jsx.
 LSP provides autocomplete functionality: once I start typing out a js keyword, LSP gives me completion candidates. Things look like this:
 https://i.imgur.com/4heaW4J.png
 What you can see *beneath* the list of LSP auto-completion candidates is a list of candidates produced by auto-complete-mode. 
 So if I hit &#x27;tab&#x27;, I get completion for the auto-complete-mode candidate. Not the currently-selected LSP candidate. 
 This is frustrating as hell. I can work around it manually, but that adds a cognitive tax that I&#x27;d rather live without. 
 Now, I could disable auto-complete-mode. But then I&#x27;d lose the capacity to get auto-completion on other strings. 
 Is there a way to get auto-complete-mode to stand down if a candidate list from LSP is being presented?

 (I actually really love getting rid of IO! Really neat ideas)
 I can use &#x60;State&#x60; successfully within a basic function, but should I try to compose various separate random functions together and &#x60;runState&#x60; over them? Seems tricky at first glance.
 Perhaps I need to look harder at this: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/State#Handling_Combined_States
 I have also &#x60;split&#x60; generators, so each function is called with its own, which works, but doesn&#x27;t look the most elegant.

                              <span>Hey guys, i finished writing my first &quot;real&quot; program in haskell. A simple (and maybe a bit overengineered) tic tac toe game for two players with variable board size. I would love to get some feedback from you guys, because i am unsure about some things.
  
Coming from an OOP background i tend to seperate code in individual files, ive seen others putting the whole program in the Main.hs or at least a huge chunk of it. Which approach is preferred, or does it even matter?
 
I represented a valid move with the &quot;Move&quot; datatype. What bugs me is that i can still generate a &quot;Move&quot; with invalid coordinates, is there a way to make it stricter / safer. I think about F# having private constructors etc.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have two questions about thunks. Please help me understand them.
 Question 1: The wikibook says that: in this expression
  let z &#x3D; (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;) in ... 
 z is a thunk.
 But stackoverflow says that the outermost layer of z is the data constructor (,), which is in WHNF, thus z is not a thunk.
 So which one is right? I tried this on GHCi
 ghci&gt; z &#x3D; (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;) ghci&gt; :sprint z z &#x3D; (_,_) 
 and see that z is not a thunk, only its components are.
 Question 2: Both 1 and &quot;hello&quot; are in normal form, thus are not thunks. So why does GHCi show that &quot;hello&quot; is a thunk?
 ghci&gt; x &#x3D; 1::Int ghci&gt; :sprint x x &#x3D; 1 ghci&gt; x &#x3D; &quot;hello&quot;::String ghci&gt; :sprint x x &#x3D; _ 
 Edit: I posted the same questions on StackOverflow

  foo :: Traversable f &#x3D;&gt; f (Pipe a b m r) -&gt; Pipe a b m (f r) 
 the resulting stream should have values from all combined pipes interleaved, i.e. something like this
  main :: IO () main &#x3D; do P.runEffect $ numberProd &gt;-&gt; (foo [evens, double]) &gt;-&gt; P.print where numberProd &#x3D; P.each [1 .. 5] double &#x3D; P.map (* 2) evens &#x3D; P.filter even

 Am I missing some way of doing this that&#x27;s so obvious that no one has written about it?
 Oh, yes, I am aware of conduit&#x27;s support for this but at this point the project is fairly heavily invested in pipes and switching to conduit isn&#x27;t really an option.

                              <span>I’m writing a simple program that has two local library modules that I wrote. Both are in the /src directory. However, I cannot for the life of me figure out a way to get stack to recognize them. I’ve tried every stack setup guide I can find and even tried restarting my project from scratch. The my-Haskell-app.cabal file does seem to recognize my library as exposed modules, but they are not built or recognized by the compiler. I always get “no known library or package” in the code editor and they never compile. I’m newer to coding with Haskell and I posted a few days ago (which helped solve my problem btw). I don’t intend to spam this this subreddit lol but I’ve tried everything and so this was my last remaining option. Thanks!

                              <span>I remember seeing a post or a video once explaining how to switch the minibuffer command without exiting the minibuffer but for the life of me I can&#x27;t remember how to do it or which package provided that functionality. For example, say I&#x27;m running consult-line and I&#x27;ve entered a string which is being completed by Vertico, and then I decide I&#x27;d rather use consult-imenu - is there a way to switch commands without exiting the minibuffer and having to retype the search term?

                              <span>Hello all, I was playing with adding holidays to calendar-holidays and I suddenly remembered, a long long time ago, I used to have configured in my emacs on a long-gone system, something where diary entries from the Lord of the Rings timeline would show in calendar/diary. Something like &quot;Fellowship leaves Rivendell&quot; on such-and-such a day. Does this strike a bell with anyone? Is there something out there to add this to my diary?

 I am trying to have something (like systemd or a bash script) that whenever I want to run emacs I got an instant shell.I know that emacsclient -c -a&#x3D;&quot;&quot; $* works out of the box but some configs are not the same as my init.el states.
 Wanted to know what you guys do to be able to run emacs faster!
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, I have the following problem:
 When I use gnome-console the &quot;shift&quot; button is already bound for console shortcuts and especially using org-mode this is nasty.
 Being flexible I decided to use the virtual console instead but to my pure horror I figured that &quot;alt + arrow keys&quot; is already bound for switching from one tty to the next.
 How can I get rid of all those keybindings? I have no use for tabs or whatever.
 System information: I run Arch Linux and use zsh.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Today, 2023-05-15, at 1830 UTC (11:30 am PDT, 2:30 pm EDT, 7:30 pm BST, 20:30 CEST, …) we are streaming the third episode of the Haskell Unfolder live on YouTube:
 https://www.youtube.com/live/1vd9mvH8Bos?feature&#x3D;share
 In this episode, we will discuss in what way parameterised datatypes are injective and type families are not. For this episode, we assume familiarity with Haskell fundamentals, in particular datatypes. Knowledge of type families is certainly helpful, but not required.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. The playlist containing all episodes so far is here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes: https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src&#x3D;c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a few years out of any haskell development and trying to understand how it&#x27;s now done.
 When I wanted an extension for a library I was using in my cabal project, I could develop a patch for the library and test it with my project by adding it with &#x27;cabal sandbox add-source&#x27;.
 Is there a way to achieve something similar now?

                              <span>I had the opportunity to update some Scala programs from the 2.x series and ZIO 1.x serios to scala3 and the latest zio2 libraries. These are department-level applications, some processing work queues and others with a react UI (or both). They were written for both JVM and JS platforms and used scala for jvm and js. I also updated a front-end, data ingest process due to customer environment changes. These are not high-performance systems, just things that need to work with little maintenance. One of the scala servers worked for 3 years with only 1 restart, so that&#x27;s not too bad. Everything is cloud-deployed, and there are only 3-4 significant data integrations, so reasonably simple use cases.
 Generally, on scala and zio:

                              <span>Hello!
 As I&#x27;m sure many of you also have had, I am having trouble with key bindings.
 Emacs packages define many keybindings, and I&#x27;d like to use some of them, but also I would like to be able to define my own, which have higher precedence.
 My ideal setup would have the following order of precedence for bindings (most to least):
  
Bindings I define for specific mode.
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run command X in org-mode.
 
 
Bindings I define globally for all other modes.
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run command Y all modes except org-mode because I previously defined it to run command X.
 
 
Bindings I didn&#x27;t define for specific modes.
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run whatever is in org-mode-map for &quot;C-c a&quot;
 
 
Bindings I didn&#x27;t define globally for all other modes
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run whatever its globally bound for by default.
 
  
To achieve this I was thinking I need to create my own minor modes with their own keymaps for each mode I define a binding for. (my-org-mode mode with a keymap containing &quot;C-c a&quot;). I can add a hook for org-mode to also enable my-org-mode, and on change-major-mode hook to disable my-org-mode.
 Then I could make this mode have higher precedence than org-mode using &#x27;emulation-mode-map-alists. (Basically what this is saying but for every mode I define bindings for)
 Could do the same for a &quot;global map&quot; that will have lower precedence than the mode-specific ones.
 Then for the bindings I don&#x27;t define it should &quot;just work&quot;.
 Is this a decent idea for trying to achieve what I want or am I way overcomplicating this?
 Also are there any packages that could help me do this or do I have to code it up myself. I don&#x27;t mind coding it but would like to save some time.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi, a small theory question:
 traverse when specialized to monads looks like:
 traverse :: (Traversable t, Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; t a -&gt; m (t b) 
 which is the shape of an endofunctor in the Kleisli category. The corresponding functor laws are:
 traverse pure &#x3D; pure -- purity law traverse (f &lt;&#x3D;&lt; g) &#x3D; traverse f &lt;&#x3D;&lt; traverse g 
 The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn&#x27;t hold in general. What would a counterexample look like? Does this mean that the type of mapM is very slightly too general?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out whether it&#x27;s possible to tell from Haddock documentation whether a given data type is a distinct type with the same name or a re-export of a type defined in another module.
 For example, if I search for IO on Hoogle, the result for data IO a points to many different modules, e.g. the Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude module from the hedgehog package: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-1.2/docs/Hedgehog-Internal-Prelude.html#t:IO. As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO. However, this must be the case since the following code typechecks:
 import qualified Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude test1 :: Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude.IO () test1 &#x3D; (pure () :: Prelude.IO ()) 
 If I, on the other hand, search for e.g. Query on Hoogle, I will get lots of data types called Query that are not the same, ie. not re-exports. For example:
  
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.6.5/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#t:Query
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-0.24/docs/Aws-DynamoDb-Commands-Query.html#t:Query
  
Which means that the following will not typecheck:
 import qualified Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query import qualified Database.PostgreSQL.Simple test2 :: Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query.Query test2 &#x3D; (undefined :: Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Query) 
 Hence my question: given the Haddocks for two datatypes with the same name, is there a way to tell if they&#x27;re the same?

                              <span>I wrote this repo a while ago and publish it on discourse, but maybe reddit is also a good place to promote it.
 The repo tries to be a &quot;challenge&quot; for people learning haskell, rather than a tutorial. You are given a series of function to implement and you end up with a working snake game. Then you are introduce to monad via refactors instead of via example.
 I think is a good resource since it goes directly into building something instead of teaching recursion, pattern matching, etc... Which is a much funnier approach, although the challengers are expected to learn that by themself (via other resources). The README.md has more information about it.

Just finished Learn You a Haskell and I&#x27;m trying to code a small simulation program that uses a two dimensional array containing a &quot;Cell&quot; datatype. I&#x27;m trying to create a simple function &#x27;&#x27;baseArray&#x27; that creates an empty array of cells based on the desired x and y size. It&#x27;s supposed to return a type &#x27;CellArray&#x27; that I have provided the definition for below. Please note that I haven&#x27;t finished the function definition for all cases because I can&#x27;t get the compiler to understand the first two. It keeps giving all sorts of trouble about not matching up with the given type signature. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of combinations. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Here is the code:
 type CellArray &#x3D; A.Array ((Int, Int),(XSize, YSize)) [((Int, Int) , Cell)] baseArray :: XSize -&gt; YSize -&gt; CellArray baseArray 0 0 &#x3D; A.array ((0,0),(0,0)) [((0,0),Cell 0 0 Nothing)] baseArray 0 y &#x3D; A.array ((0,0),(0,y)) [((0,i), Cell 0 i Nothing) | i&lt;-[1..y]]

                              <span>The standard way to map Haskell to category theory is to use the category Hask, where objects represent types, and arrows represent functions between types. It&#x27;s known that this is an approximation - for example, it ignores bottom values. But I want to talk about another way in which it fails to match the Haskell type system.
 In Hask, we can talk about an object representing Int, one representing Bool, one representing (Int, Bool), one representing Either Int Bool, etc.
 However, this only handles the structural types in Haskell. Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age &#x3D; Age Int or newtype Count &#x3D; Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.
 But how would one distinguish which one is which?
 If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?
 One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.
 But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type? You could end up with the same name being paired with two different types.

 What I cannot (it really frustrates me), I cannot figure out how to make hyperlink between 2 different posts. I&#x27;m currently using the 1subtree&#x3D;1post paradigm. 
  
Linking with the (org-copy-id) within single post works without any issue.
 However, this appears not to work if I referencing to another post (ie. another subtree with different md export).
  
Am I doing something wrong? How do I make hyperlink to different posts?
  
Update:
 I just figured out how to use relref or ref:
 From here: I&#x27;ve been copying following code:
  This links to the @@hugo:[Org Special Blocks]({​{}})@@ page. 
 However, in actuality there is invisible character  between {{ which was causing problem.
  This links to the @@hugo:[Org Special Blocks]({{}})@@ page.  With this I can make the linking. 
  
Yet however, I&#x27;d still love to use org-copy-id if possible. If you know how to do it please let me know. org-id is much better when I export to LaTeX PDF in the future

                              <span>There is a Neovim package called noice, which (among other things) can display messages as scrolling toast-like notifications in the upper-right corner of the frame.
 This seems particularly useful for a subset of messages that are currently sent to the minibuffer (flymake/flycheck info, whether compilation completed, etc.). While messages sent the the minibuffer are certainly sufficient for this, I find that I often miss them when focused. I feel like having what amounts to a popup notification would capture my attention without being frustratingly noise (like using message-box, for example).
 I&#x27;ve looked around for a similar package for emacs, but have come up empty. Does anybody know of any good options off of the top of their head?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have an issue with what I believe is caused by Corfu. As seen in the first screenshot, corfu cuts off all hits at roughly 1.5. Poor example since it’s only 2 results in the list but it remains the same nonetheless. 
 As seen in the second screenshot, company mode works just as expected. 
 The config for corfu is the following. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;corfu) (require &#x27;kind-icon)
 (setq corfu-cycle t) (setq corfu-auto t) ;; (setq corfu-auto-prefix 1) (setq corfu-auto-delay 0.0) (setq corfu-echo-delay 0.0) (setq corfu-popupinfo-delay 0.0) (setq corfu-count 10) (setq corfu-scroll-margin 5) (setq corfu-echo-documentation nil)
 (defun my/enable-corfu () &quot;Enable Corfu mode on prog-mode hooks&quot; (corfu-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;my/enable-corfu)
 (add-hook &#x27;corfu-mode-hook #&#x27;corfu-popupinfo-mode)
 (setq tab-always-indent &#x27;complete)

 A few excerpts:
  
Software freedom has hitherto been framed in terms of legal requirements, as a means of bending copyright law to forward the needs of the user. The intent is to empower those who run the program to operate aloof from the influence of the program’s creator or distributor. While the repurposing of copyright law is fecund, the emphasis on code alone remains limited in scope and thus unambitious in outlook. The target audience is necessarily restricted to a nucleus of enthusiasts who are more or less inclined to tinker with the program. Everybody else is relegated to the status of a “normal user”, else “normie”. [...]
 Compassion is key in dismantling those barriers to entry. All code should be…</span>

                              <span>My current job uses a complete Typescript stack, (Node backend, React and custom framework for the frontend). I&#x27;m already using Typescript mode and lsp-mode for auto completion, and I&#x27;m using eslint from VSCode to catch errors. 
 ​
 There are still some snags I&#x27;m running into. First, I would like some kind of autoimport for components. I know VSCode does this somehow, but I&#x27;m not sure what package or configuration could bring this functionality into Emacs. 
 Second, a lot of files I work on are over 1,000 lines of code and it is causing lsp-mode to freeze. Is there a way to improve lsp-mode&#x27;s performance?

                              <span>I have some commercial experience as a java developer, but due to the war kinda jobless right now. 
 Current job market where I live is: - java is dead for juniors - C# is taking over spots for juniors - 1-2 junior scala dev jobs per month with almost no competition.
 Honestly, I would like to ditch JVM as .net seems like the most optimal solution for now, but I am still considering to go with scala.
 The reason for that is that I really love functional programming. I would prefer haskell job, but yeah it is non existing in my country. 
 I am not that interested in big data, more in overall backend development / problem solving
 Is it hard to find a job as a scala (zio/cats) developer?
 And what is the state of the language? I saw a lot of messages in this community that scala is dead/diying/dreaded. Local folks in my country just tells the same.

                              <span>Jam - an incredibly simple DI Scala library.
 jam-monad module provides Reval monad that encodes the idea of allocating an object which has an associated finalizer. Can be thought of as a mix of cats.effect.Resource and cats.Eval. It can be useful in cases when you need to control an object lifecycle: how many times the object should be allocated, when it should be allocated and how it should be closed. In the combination with jam-cats it should cover most DI cases. More info and examples can be found here: https://github.com/yakivy/jam#reval-monad

                              <span>Usually org-mode manual is pretty exhaustive and very useful source of information. However it doesn’t offer an exhaustive list of all build-in properties, nor detail if and in what form they can be overwritten by user, and what happens if user so does anyway.
 This kind of list is the exact thing I am trying to parse together for myself. My current strategy is using the add propety function which lists all available properties, the Reserved Properties -listing under Properties section, which offers a glossary explanation of individual properties, and searching the Index for word ‘Property’, and once I find a new link, I visit it and hopefully find other properties near it.
 However, this is pretty slow way to gather the list, and it doesn’t really distinguish between useful properties, properties user can use if they want, and system-breaking properties.
 Usually better documentation is written in the relevant chapter of the manual, if the property is intended to be used.
 Has anyone written about this online? I found some youtube videos discussing some of the properties related to clocking, but generally it seems this information is written from the opposite direction from my approach: from usecase to property, not from property to usecase.
 I don’t have any good reasoning behind wanting this information. I just want to write it down in my notes, and while doing it gain some insight into org-mode as a system.
 What I mean by system breaking is something like CLOCKSUM_T. I haven’t yet tested the behaviour, but as this is used to calculate todays clocked time for a heading and it’s children, it is very clear that either the users input is overwritten, or the clocksum is inaccurate. This might not be strictly system-breaking, but neither does it make sense inside the system.

 If you find an under-maintained Haskell package which is useful but just needs a little freshening up, you generally have two good options.
  
Submit a PR and pester the maintainer to publish a new version. Then next year another person who wants to use the package will have to repeat this process.
 Ask to become a maintainer. Then next year another person who wants to use the package will pester you.
  
The Haskell GitHub Trust gives you a third option: 
  
Add the package to the Haskell Github Trust.
  
All Trust Owners can publish any package in the Trust. It’s easy to become a Trust Owner if you have any reputation at all in the Haskell community.

                              <span>I like the org agenda log where you can see what you did in the past few days, as a list of days with log events under each day. So far, I have managed to get it to work on the basis of state changes on todo items (DOING -&gt; DONE, etc). 
 Would it be possible to include &quot;todo item creation events&quot; in such a log? That is, not base the selector on a state change in existings item, but rather the creation of new todo items? That could be useful reminder and summary of what you added recently.

If anyone wants to help me turn this into an actual elisp function, be my guest. I&#x27;m waiting for the author of gptel to un-jank the hard coded queries so I can just use the existing transient menu, etc. 
 This prompt is something I came up with while taking notes. I wanted my literature notes to be easily linked via ideas. And I wanted GPT to extract them so i did not have to type them. I want to make this into a function so that I can use org-roam-db-query to grab a list of existing tags to give chat gpt existing selections to choose among.
 Prompt:
 You are an emacs plugin. You analyze generic text that may be pure prose or a mix of prose and code. After analysis you recommend 5 filetags for the file to assist with organization and search. create more abstract tags that cultivate the connections between ideas.
 ​
 You must print all recommended tags in a single code block.
 You must use the following output formatting:
 Example:
 Input Ideas: Research and Writing
 Output tags: #+filetags: :research:writing

                              <span>I over-rely on org-super-agenda as a dashboard for running my life and radar for upcomings. 
 So, as an example, three entries right now.  In 4d.: TODO Invoice customer x In 17d.: Nephew&#x27;s Birthday&#x60; (3/15): Stay at Hotel Y&#x60; (taken from my google calendar) 
 One thing that would have been super useful recently was to be able to display was number of days elapsed from a particular date, so for example:
 [Day 15] Arrived in Country X
 Also would have been super useful if I could create a heading like that with an upper limit on something:
 [15/30] Country X Visa on Arrival
 (I did the last with a calendar entry previously, but it&#x27;s not really where it belongs)
 Is there a org-feature or package which supports that in some easy way (really basically a days elapsed kind of thing.)
 Apologies if this is an obvious one. My google fu seemed not to be able to find a way to support this in org agenda.
 thanks!

                              <span>It feels like the barrier to contribute to Haskell-the-language is significantly too high these days, and that being perfect gets in the way of getting things done. Personally, I feel much less inspired to be involved, because even modest changes require a huge amount of make-work on top of the actual labor involved to make the change.
 Thus why I&#x27;m writing this as a reddit post rather than going through the proposal process---if anyone is inspired by these, please feel free to take the ball and run with it!
  
Meta-issues aside, proposal #165 was just announced here, wanting to add an obviously-good function to base. Why does this have to be a proposal, instead of just a PR? There are the &quot;how should we implement this function&quot; concerns, which a PR can tackle, and then the &quot;let&#x27;s make sure we don&#x27;t break every downstream user.&quot;
 The latter is the concern of the community, but it ought not be; why don&#x27;t we just add compiler support to prevent this from happening? Thus, my proposal:
 GHC should not emit ambiguous usage errors for functions that shadow ones defined in base. Instead, just use the non-base one, emit a warning saying &quot;hey, sorry!&quot; and be done with it. If you want the current behavior, promote the warning to an error via -Werror&#x3D;....
 Now we can freely add to base without requiring any would-be contributor to build all of stackage and perform a breakage analysis.

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;ve been working on this for the past three months or so.
 Honestly I&#x27;m pretty nervous to share it here because it&#x27;s pretty imperative, ugly Haskell compared to a lot of what gets shared and discussed here--it uses a basic ReaderT pattern with a lot of mucking about with STM values--and it still has a ton of corner cases not being handled, probably a bunch of dumb code and bugs I&#x27;m clueless about, etc. etc. (I miss PR reviews when working solo). But, that&#x27;s probably not going to change any time soon. Even still, I&#x27;m pretty happy with how it&#x27;s working for me, and if even one other person gets something out of it I&#x27;ll be psyched.

 I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback you have.
 More to the point, I&#x27;ve been hanging out in the Haskell community and on this subreddit in particular for a while, and I wanted to share this thing I&#x27;ve been working on because so much of it is due to the help I&#x27;ve received here, the great posts folks have shared here, the amazing random comments containing deep wisdom or cool information or essential practical advice I&#x27;ve found here...etc. I have so much respect and admiration for so many in the Haskell community and I feel lucky to be able to participate here at all. Thank you all for checking this out and for being a great community, one I hope to be a part of for a while.
 Special shoutout to https://github.com/tarleb for HsLua, which is really cool and which more people should be using! Also thanks to my former CV colleagues who helped me grow so much in my Haskell and PureScript skills, if any of you see this.

                              <span>This is based on a conversation I had with my manager with the null value. Both of us dislike it, and in Haskell there’s the Maybe type to deal with this.
 But let’s say I need to write some values into a database, and this null that I observe is normally an integer or floating point value. What could I convert Nothing to, when writing my data to persistent storage (for example the price of a product that’s null, or regional temperature taken from an API)?

 No warnings are shown anywhere in the file, I can ctrl+k to hover on certain keywords like &#x27;import&#x27; and the &#x27;System&#x27; module and it&#x27;ll pop up an information box, but trying to hover on any variable results in the error:
 man.lua: &quot;no manual entry for groupCalories&quot;

I&#x27;ve never seen projectile do this before, and I&#x27;m not sure how to debug it. Can you get a log from the cache population? The project is in a git repo that seems to be detected otherwise. Also, this is emacs-plus@29 on a mac, accessing a Linux workstation over tramp/ssh. Accessing local repos on the mac seems to work the way its supposed to.

                              <span>Hi all, I I have different kinds of org documents:
  
Journals
 College notes
 Misc 
  
For stuff like notes, I&#x27;d like to have numbered and indented headlines, serif fonts, etc..
 For other notes, I&#x27;d like a sans font, non numbered headlines, etc...
 How can I achieve such thing?

                              <span>I want to be able to run my c++ code by a key like f5, then have emacs split the screen, run eshell in it, and type &quot;g++ /path/to/file -o /path/to/output &amp;&amp; /path/to/output&quot; so it would execute my code. I can write the part to make the command string but I can&#x27;t write the part which emacs would split the window, the run eshell in it, and run the command string in it. How can I do that?
 I have already tried quickrun for running my c++ code inside emacs but it&#x27;s pretty buggy and sometimes need emacs to restart to be able to work again.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a problem with the mini-frame with gnome-shell.
 The mini-frame&#x27;s frame don&#x27;t disappear when I close the minibuffer.
 It&#x27;s a resize problem if I read well but the fix don&#x27;t work for me.

                              <span>Hi, Im on macos, and I&#x27;ve just downloaded both emacs and doom emacs. So when I type emacs in terminal or open emacs.app, doom emacs open up. However, I want to use both vanilla and doom emacs simultaneously but with different configs, settings... like 2 seperate apps. Is there any ways to handle this? 
 (I tried emacs -q but that just open a vanilla emacs scratch and I can&#x27;t configure any configs)
 Thank you so much.

                              <span>We are using Scala 3 with ZIO, and I am really pleased with the language and libraries. I have a question for others regarding debugging though. We moved from IntelliJ to VSCode + Metals a while back because of the lack of Scala 3 support in IntelliJ. But I&#x27;m having serious problems with the debugger, to me it&#x27;s nearly worthless. It can&#x27;t do the simplest things, like just step over code, it jumps to what feel like totally random places deep in the ZIO codebase. The only way I can get it to sometimes work is by using {} brackets so that I can put pure Scala code, no ZIO&#x27;s, on their own lines, and only break there. Then run from break point to break point, stepping is essentially useless.
 Is it just me, or are others having the same experience? Any good tips, or workarounds? Has IntelliJ started to catch up with Scala 3 support? I feel like the ZIO developers that I watch on Youtube, who are total programming studs, would not tolerate such a bad debugging experience.
 That&#x27;s a lot of questions, thanks to anybody that has good tips.

                              <span>Following the recent wrangling about Scala&#x27;s future. I think it&#x27;s important to mention some major apps backed by Scala outside of the the Spark world.
 In this article they explain why they decided to move away from python (which is a rare case AFAIK ). 
 ​
 Note: I am not a scala developer nor a scala advocate but I used to write some data piplines using it.

                              <span>Recently I have been looking at alternatives to Unity3d for gamedev. As part of this I created a very simple hex-based tic-tac-toe game using Scala.js and the 3d library Babylon.js. It also uses Vite.js for quick dev turnaround, Electron.js for native packaging, and ScalablyTyped to create a Babylon.js facade.
 I was quite happy with the result. It was especially nice to program in Scala again (after a long break) and be able to imagine using it for both client and server code. Now I need to consider whether it is right for me, as there are a number of business issues around using Javascript, but at least the technical side seems possible.
 Since there were a few pains getting all the different libraries to play nicely together, I thought the result may be useful to other people. No tutorial, but my notes are in the README and the code is all available on Github. Be aware I am not a Scala expert, but the code works as far as I have tested it.
 I broke the code into a few pieces for libs for possible reuse, or other people to look to for ideas
  
HexTacToe https://github.com/jarrahtech/HexTacToe - the game itself
 kassite https://github.com/jarrahtech/kassite - Scala.js for (hopefully) functionality common to multiple Scala.js/Babylon.js games - currently has tweening and some shader material stuff. No tests yet - need to work on that
 babylonjsfacade https://github.com/jarrahtech/babylonjsfacade - Scala.js facade of Babylon.js 6.2 (generated within the Github project by ScalablyTyped). I made this a separate project so that the others didn&#x27;t need to import and build it (as it is quite large)
  
also a couple of other libs which are less important for demonstrating the technologies:
  
hex https://github.com/jarrahtech/hex - Scala/Scala.js cross-building hex grid library
 jarrah-util https://github.com/jarrahtech/jarrah-util - Scala/Scala.js cross-building common game code/maths lib
  
Hope its helpful for someone else,
 Charles.

                              <span>Having only just found out about Scala recently, one of the things I seem to read everywhere is that Scala&#x27;s popularity is not growing. In fact, some seem to say it is declining, and the numbers might bear that theory out somewhat.
 But most things I&#x27;ve read about the language are absolutely awesome!
 Two of the main problems I have heard are:
  
Too much change. Apparently the leap to Scala 3 was a little rushed and tooling is still catching up. This has left companies with a choice of either using legacy or investing in something that keeps changing.
 Too much power. It almost seems as though the power of Scala is limitless. Most articles I&#x27;ve read list a huge reel of concepts. Some of the ones that I can recognise seem powerful to the point of abusability, like metaprogramming. This also makes the language harder to learn.
  
Potential intervention to address criticisms:
  
A promise to freeze changes to the language and other core parts for a period of, say, three years (exempting bug fixes).
  
What do you think? What would it take to make the Scala market grow?

                              <span>I am looking for some guidance on how to handle the case where sbt doc or publish is failing due to Lombok generated methods not being found. 
 I have a mixed scala and Java project, where the Java sources are using Lombok to generate builders and getters for the classes. The scala sources in turn depend on these sources. 
 Regular compilation succeeds and the project is able to run its main method fine. However, when I attempt to publish, sbt fails at the (Compile / doc) stage due to generated methods not being found. 
 Is there anyway to configure the doc to respect these classes? I guess more generally as well I am curious to learn why the doc is even erroring of compilation is successful

                              <span>Hi,
 for some months I am in the process of designing some HTML Component system for Scala(JS) and have some API things I would like to discuss.
 The basic idea is simple
  
A Component should be immutable
 A Component should assemble itself as a function. This should never fail.
 State is stored in Models. During rendering, Models can lookup the current state of models. Or they can subscribe Models, which will lead to a re-rendering by the Engine.
 During assembly, components can also register events.
 A Component can create sub components (in order to compose)
 The component should know as little as possible from the rendering engine, so that I can swap it. The engine should handle the whole rendering and event handling stuff.
 The assumption is &quot;Browsers are really fast at rendering HTM…</span>

                              <span>Last year, when Akka moved to the BSL, I mentioned that for my use-case (largely, teaching students the ideas behind Concurrency-Oriented Programming and some ideas about streaming) I&#x27;d probably end up writing my own little actors framework. 
 Amdram (named after &quot;amateur dramatics&quot;) is ticking along, with snapshots now up on Sonatype snapshots. MIT licence.
 Slide deck introducing it to students, which follows on from the one on Concurrency Oriented Programming
 (Also both written quickly)
 Amdram is probably &quot;rough as guts&quot; but small enough to have my students doing a little robocode-like assignment with it. The API probably will change a little, but not until after the assignment due date in a couple of weeks.
 Notably, 
  
The return type of message handler of MessageHandler[T] | Unit will probably change to replace Unit with an explicit &quot;keep this behaviour&quot; token, as otherwise it&#x27;s easy to get an odd behaviour putting it into an if. 
 
Some refactoring on what gets bundled into the actor context and whether Actors should remember their execution contexts (at the moment, it feels like there&#x27;s some repetition/overlap in the implicit arguments) 
 
iteratees package is still under development, along with other forms of small streaming packages
 
At the moment, the jsui package is empty. The idea there is to build some veautiful/doctacular widgets to visualise the actors working in realtime

 How do I declare this function if I want to apply functions in order? And how should I write It?
 So far I thought of foldl (.) Carrot [Break, Add, Delete, Dance] as a option, but is this right?
 I&#x27;m trying to make a endless function composition. Or well, endless if the person wants to spend hours putting functions to do.

 I have an issue with FFI and I would like to ask you for indications.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a function in C++ with this signature: c++ int f(char* s); 
 And I import it to Haskell. If I understood it&#x27;s like this: hs foreign import ccall &quot;f&quot; _f :: CString -&gt; CInt 
 I need to allocate the CString and it necessarily involve side effects, therefore IO. But I would like to verify if in order to remove the IO I have to use unsafe things.
 The end result should be a wrapper function like this: hs f :: String -&gt; String 
 Thank you very much !

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know whether this learning process is fast or not, but I&#x27;m really proud of myself. 🥳
 By the way, I learned OCaml before haskell, so it&#x27;s not totally from beginning.
 For those who are interested in my programming language, codes are at here https://github.com/bzy-debug/uml. Basically it&#x27;s a minimal pure strict functional programming language with lisp like syntax and ML like semantics.
 I&#x27;m very glad that you guys interested in my learning process! Feel free to ask me anything you&#x27;re interested in!

 This was recently was enabled, and is basically considered an experiment. So, love it or hate it, now is a great time to email savannah-hackers-public@gnu.org your thoughts. There&#x27;s also a CTA for someone who wants to hack upstream cgit, maybe to enable (e.g.) a cookie to allow users to turn it off, or a per repository backend knob, or .

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to be able to switch between a couple saved &#x27;layouts&#x27;; a layout being both the window splits, and the buffer _including location_ in each. ie: so if I switch to another saved layout, and then back, its exactly where I left off. Switching between 2 or 3 or more layouts would be awesome.
 No need to save them between emacs sessions, but that could be interesting as well.
 Ideally such concepts as..
 - layout list
 - layout create
 - layout switch
 - layout kill
 I&#x27;ve been fiddling with 0blayout package, which covers most of it. No layout list, but layout-switch with vertico more or less covers it.
 The problem with that one is it doesn&#x27;t seem to save/restore the location for each window..
 ex: If I make a layout which is split into a top and bottom window A and B, with code on top and an org file on bottom, and then switch to some other layout.. and then back, it&#x27;ll prooperly restore the window layout for A and B and bcak to those files... great! HOWEVER, if A and B are the same file, but different locations within it, that doesn&#x27;t work.. both windows A and B will switch to the same file, the same position within it. 
 I guess I could look into saving window layouts to registers and popping around that way, but I was sure there was a more sophisticated way of doing it.
 (I forget if Bufler does this .. I use filetree as my buffer-list replacement, and bufler doesn&#x27;t work well when Tramp with remote sessions are alive.. so I&#x27;ve generally ignored Bufler the last year or two.)
 Thanks for reading :)

                              <span>This is probably going to be stupid simple and I&#x27;ll regret posting, but I can&#x27;t figure out why this elisp errors in the seq-filter. 
 (with-current-buffer (create-file-buffer (expand-file-name &quot;~/desktop/test.org&quot;)) (insert &quot;* Contacts\n** Joe Dirt\n* Configuration&quot;) (goto-char 0) (org-end-of-subtree) (insert &quot;\n\n&quot;) (let* ((contacts &#x27;((:fullname &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;) (:fullname &quot;John Doe&quot;))) (filtered-contacts (seq-filter (lambda (contact) (when-let (name (plist-get contact :fullname)) (not (org-find-exact-headline-in-buffer (plist-get contact :fullname))))) contacts))) (insert (mapconcat (lambda (contact) (format &quot;** %s&quot; (plist-get contact :fullname))) filtered-contacts &quot;\n&quot;)) (buffer-string))) 
 The error message is not: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil which is weird to me because nil is a perfectly valid input for not.
 Because it works fine when in the contacts org file, I&#x27;m assuming this is a buffer issue, but I&#x27;m not sure how to debug

                              <span>For those of you using Python with a language server: do you install the language server (e.g. pyright or pylsp) globally, or in the virtual environment (e.g. as a developer dependency)? Why?
 Personally I am still not sure what I think is better. Installing a language server in each venv seems a bit of overkill, especially since I am always going to use the same language server and the people I work with on Python projects don&#x27;t need the (same) language server (as they use something like VSCode with Pylance). 
 On the other hand, installing the language server in the venv saves me a bit of work creating the relevant config files to ensure they run the commands with the right binary (e.g. I don&#x27;t need to create a mypy.ini files to ensure mypy runs from the venv, nor do I need a pyrightconfig.json to point the server to the venv).
 I found a way to get both pyright and pylsp working on Emacs, whether they are globally installed or installed in the venv. Just curious about how you do it and why!

 I like to use it. Above all the org-mode. This is for me the best IDE. It is really nice to activate layers. The config file is minimalist around just 100 lines compare to lunarvim. But I&#x27;m still facing some issues that I can not solve to allow to use it daily.

 This is the main barrier. It is not easy to debug cpp from my point of view. If you have a good feeling and workflow, please share it.

                              <span>I need a piece of elisp that would return the project name for the buffer at point. Seems simple, right? The problem is, I can&#x27;t find a way to do this reliably. Let me explain.
 If I have a dir structure like this:
 . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── proyecto-tres 
 And the current buffer is readme.org, getting the project name - &#x27;proyecto-uno&#x27; is fairly easy, if you&#x27;re using projectile, you can do (projectile-project-name), right? Alternatively, you can use: (magit-toplevel), which returns full path, i.e., ~/projects/proyecto-uno/ and then you can just grab the last segment.
 Now, it gets tricky when you&#x27;re using git-worktrees and the structure of the project is like this:
 . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── .bare ├── master ├── development ├── .git ├── readme2.org ├── proyecto-tres 
 The current buffer is readme2.org. How do you get the project name? (projectile-project-name) returns development (and I want &#x27;proyecto-dos&#x27;). (magit-toplevel) returns full path to &quot;development&quot; dir not to &#x27;proyecto-dos&#x27;. 
 So then you may suggest, why don&#x27;t you check, if the buffer is inside a worktree? And that I don&#x27;t know how to. I assumed I could use (magit-inside-worktree-p), but it always returns t, regardless of where it&#x27;s called from, readme2.org, or from inside &#x27;proyecto-uno&#x27; dir. 
 So how do I find the project name reliably?

                              <span>Hello!
 I don&#x27;t really understand how text-encoding works at any level, and I&#x27;m not really a coder, so forgive me if my terminology is a little loose.
 My org-mode files have begun to get infested with strange chararacter codes. I might copy-paste something with a diacritic, and it will be fine until I open the file next and it will show up as &quot;\305\202&quot;, for example. 
 I have a feeling that my files may be composed of different text-encoding systems. Is there a way to harmonize them? How do I go about figuring out what to do?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Since 0.4.0 shipped, I updated the accompanying guide I wrote.
 Since I also updated my screen-capture workflow for video recording (for champagne), it&#x27;s perhaps time to answer some questions about the deepest, darkest corners of building applications with transient.
 On the surface, you can be forgiven for thinking transient is similar to hydra. Without the state juggling and flow control of transient, you cannot make the same level of expressive user interface.
 Some of the topics that get beyond the surface and require thinking about how you would use this software to build applications
  
Flow control
 History &amp; state
 Custom infixes
  
In particular you can also be forgiven for thinking custom infixes are some kind of crazy extensibility without much practical value. This is far from the truth. Attaching complex values to your user input command sentences and quickly modifying any part of these sentences allows you to express a lot of rich commands in a short time. That is the secret to the efficiency of magit, and magit doesn&#x27;t even use very complex flow control. Infix overriding allows your interface to reflect and follow the state of the application.
 I&#x27;m not terribly incentivized to go beyond the showcase, which at worst contains working examples for just about every behavior. It is less complex code than magit and made of examples that demonstrate behavior in isolation. However, if the demand is interesting and severe, I may be spurred into finishing a richer demonstration.

                              <span>Hi all. I have fido-mode enabled. How can I make fido-mode prioritize exact match? Say I have two functions foo and foo-bar and I have just called the function foo-bar (M-x foo-bar and press Enter). Now, I want to call foo. I type M-x foo and the suggestions foo-bar and foo show up in that order. So if I press enter (bound to icomplete-fido-ret), it runs foo-bar even though foo is an exact match. I know I can run foo by M-x foo M-j, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m asking. 
 I&#x27;ve read through the definitions of the various styles in completion-styles-alist, but I can&#x27;t find what I&#x27;m looking for. For reference, this is my current setting for completion styles: (setq completion-styles &#x27;(emacs21 basic partial-completion))
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>So my problem with large line freezing emacs is solved to a reasonable and usable degree. My next problem is: when I print that long string (it&#x27;s a response from an api which contain a lot of data) it takes around 20 seconds to output all of the string while in the terminal, it works pretty fast (certainly less than a second, I&#x27;m using alacritty). Is there any way to print them faster?
 My long line optimzing settings are set globally and they don&#x27;t have any effect on emacs outputting the large text. It&#x27;s a python script and I tried to run it in shell, eshell, and python inferior shell in emacs but noticed no difference.
 Also another thing: is there a way to view for example, only the last 10 thousand characters of buffers that are not files? I see that vscode has implemented it and I think it would help with emacs using less ram. THANKS!

 &#x60;eman&#x60; for reading man pages in emacs (from terminal).

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;m trying to move my PKMS into org-roam, and I&#x27;ve run into an issue I can&#x27;t seem to find the answer to. I tried to search but I couldn&#x27;t find any other posts about this. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening:
 I create a new note with org-roam-node-find RET  RET. My note names are stuff like daily.2022.05.10, with dots used as hierarchical separators. Org replaces all the dots in the name I supplied with underscores (e.g. daily_2022_05_10).
 I suppose I could just accept the difference, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like the Emacs way, not to mention underscores are easy for me to mistake as dashes, which have another function in my naming system. I&#x27;d like for it to just accept the exact name I give it without replacing anything.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a specific example for a concept I want to capture within my Zettelkasten, but I&#x27;m having a hard time identifying how to go about it.
SITUATION
I&#x27;m reading my book on product management when I encounter this infographic which essentially summarizes the entire book in one image.
I&#x27;m ECSTATIC!  This contains each of the individual pieces of the system (atomic ideas).  But then my enthusiasm dies down as I realize this image is essentially MULTIPLE ideas in one graphic, triggering analysis paralysis as I consider how to capture this within my Obsidian-based Zettelkasten.
MY QUESTION FOR YOU
Before you read on, pretend you ran into this information.  Your goal is to use your Zettelkasten to help you write strategy documents for your company AND to write articles for product managers in startups to help them launch better products.
How would YOU capture the gold within this infographic within your Zettelkasten?
OPTIONS I&#x27;M CONSIDERING
Now that you&#x27;ve considered your own solutions, here&#x27;s a few I thought of.
Create one Obsidian Canvas, capturing the entire infographic (a Card for each part of the flowchart and each checklist).  Then begin creating Zettels or linking existing Zettels for each individual component, replacing each Card with a Note instead as I go.


Technically, this option violates the &quot;Atomic Notes&quot; rule since my first Zettel would be this full infographic - I&#x27;d be essentially capturing a contextualized idea, then breaking it down, which may not yield surprise insights as going bottom-up should.

Create an Overview Zettel (simple text file) with each item written out, then use this Overview Zettel to create individual Zettels from there.


Same concept as #1, but in a text file rather than a Canvas.

Keep this infographic in my Lit Note (aka Reference) and create individual zettels as I go.
Does one of these align with what you would do?  If so, which one and why?  If not, how would your approach differ from any of mine?
Thanks in advance!</span>

                              <span>I am confused about the startup time of Emacs with different combinations of the settings of package-enable-at-startup and package-initialize. I am using Emacs 29 and I make heavy use of use-package and I also have (setq package-quickstart t). 
 From https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/rvqijq/usepackage_and_packagequickstart_for_faster/ (or https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11q7ybf/is_packageinitialize_needed_in_the_init_file_in or https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/x63etn/very_long_startup_time_with_no_obvious_cause/in7bld8/ or https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/76242/is-package-initialize-needed-in-the-init-file-in-emacs-28-x-and-higher) I understand that I would not need to call (package-initialize).
 However, the combination
  ;;; in early-init.el (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) ;;; in init.el (package-initialize) 
 starts much faster (0.8 seconds) than setting
 ;;; early-init.el (setq package-enable-at-startup t) ;;; not calling (package-initialize) in init.el 
 (This second setup takes about 1.3 seconds to start).
 Of course, I might have other problems in my init.el file but, shouldn&#x27;t I expect that I should see a faster startup with the second combination?

                              <span>Fellow Emacsen,
 We&#x27;ve completed work on the initial prototype of Attribution-Based Economics that was announced at EmacsConf in December. Please read the launch announcement to learn more about what this release entails.
 The pilot projects (including Symex.el) are accepting financial contributions and will distribute them to sources of value including contributors and antecedent projects in a process that we all have a say in.
 We couldn&#x27;t have gotten this far without the support and participation of this fantastic community, so thank you! I hope, with your help, that we&#x27;ll manage to prove that non-adversarial economics is not only possible but much better in just every way, not least of which is bringing us together in creating value rather than pushing us apart as our world does today.
 I can&#x27;t wait to see what we&#x27;ll accomplish together!

                              <span>How can I open a file using the keyboard without losing focus on the speedbar frame? I can currently do this with the mouse, but there is only a command for editing &#x60;speedbar-edit-line&#x60; that takes focus away from the speedbar when opening the file, which is not ideal for when i want to preview files.
 also, unrelated, but i think speedbar is pretty good/underrated built-in utility, the only downsides is what i just described and the fact that it can only exist as a frame (yes, i know sr-speedbar.el exists, but it&#x27;s pretty unstable in my experiance)

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I am almost ready to release version 3.0 of my org-gtd package, but I would like to get some feedback on the documentation before I do the actual release and mark it as stable (I have had some beta testers for the code already, but more wouldn&#x27;t hurt :D ).
 Ideally, the documentation is read on emacs, but the .org file is also available for consumption.
 The org-mode file is at https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/doc/org-gtd.org 
 All I need at first blush are your questions about things that don&#x27;t make sense, or that you think should be explained before approaching a given topic (or even knowledge organization). I have just noticed that github has added an outline option (the right-most icon at the top of the file info), which might allow you to skip quickly through the increasingly large &quot;upgrading&quot; section.
 Do note this assumes some amount of knowledge about Getting Things Done, so that might turn out to be a blocker anyway :) 
 The info file is here : https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/org-gtd.info And obviously you might want to download it and load it inside emacs with C-u h i. For the info file, in addition to questions about things that make sense and don&#x27;t, I have questions about how things get displayed through the interface, what links make sense or are surprising, what is helpful, etc.
 If you choose to help, I&#x27;ll be extremely grateful! You can leave the feedback here in comments, or open it as an issue on Github, as you prefer.

 update: So long is not working. I also installed emacs29-git from AUR but still no luck. Really? Emacs, the great extensible editor can&#x27;t handle long lines? That&#x27;s like a big body builder not being able to hold its poop. It&#x27;s BASIC functionality...

                              <span>I learnt emacs from its tutorial. My initial goal was to use it as code editor for multiple languages: C, C++, Python, Java maybe javascript and rust ...
 I installed lsp and some other things from reading guides, its somehow works but i am still far away from using it at comfortable level.
 I dont know how to customize my emacs. I basically use C-f C-b C-e C-a and some other basic commands when i use emacs. I dont know how can i customize my .emacs file according to my needs. 
 For example, I want to have a left side panel for browsing dirs/files when coding, and having a run button since everytime when i want to test my code, I&#x27;m switching shell window of emacs and calling my executable. But I can&#x27;t.
 In conclusion, I want to configure emacs for my coding needs but i dont have sufficient knowledge and i cant understand much from what i read/watch on internet. I cant find good guides etc. 
 Can i get any advice, to make up for my deficiencies?

 Using Fastmail&#x27;s web app, when I &quot;Archive&quot; a message in the Inbox, it appears to move that message to the IMAP folder &quot;Archive.&quot;
 But from mu4e, after syncing with mbsync and indexing with mu (i.e., mu4e-update-mail-and-index), the supposedly archived messages still appear in the /Inbox folder in ~/Mail except now they have the IMAP &quot;Trashed&quot; &quot;T&quot; flag.
 Can anybody point me to a reference that can help me solve this mismatch? 
 Have I made an obvious misconfiguration?

                              <span>Howdy all, 
 So for the first time in over 20 years, I&#x27;ve switched to linux fron Mac as my daily driver.
 And of course, immediately tried to set up exwm, as one does...
 exwm seems to work generally fine, except that when I log in with it, it is way scaled down and opens up a frame about an eight the size of my screen. Everything is scaled down, the fonts, the windows, etc. I can fullscreen the frame, but the fonts are still all tiny. 
 Odd thing is that any other program I open up inside an emacs frame is scaled just fine... so it&#x27;s only emacs text buffers that have this issue.
 Running  emacs 29 pre-release compiled with native comp and x minimal emacs config with a handful of packages, mappings, and a few fns.. nothing fancy latest pop_os dell xps 15 3840 x 2400 resolution no exwm specific config other than exwm-enable (did try the example config)  all the font scaling and randr stuff seems to be set fine.
 Not sure where else to look.. 
 Any pointers much appreciated!! Thanks!!

                              <span>Basically im looking a replacement for insomnia, for me it was a good tool for testing api&#x27;s, but right now im looking for alternatives, cause with my current potato computer, app like insomnia is very slow to run. also doing everything in emacs is just cooler.
 I would appreciate some some packages, workflows for this kinda of job.

                              <span>I have the following in my init.el:
 (setq org-refile-targets &#x60;((,(directory-files &quot;~/org/ref/&quot; t &quot;\\.org$&quot;) :maxlevel . 2) (&quot;~/org/gtd/todo.org&quot; :maxlevel . 1) (&quot;~/org/gtd/projects.org&quot; :maxlevel . 2))) (setq org-refile-use-outline-path &#x27;file) (setq org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil) (setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes &#x27;confirm) 
 And it seems to work except for one thing. I&#x27;m using helm, and when I hit my refile key sequence I get a *helm-mode-org-refile* window, and I only want it to show refile options/candidates that meet the given maxlevel limit. I assumed this would mean (e.g., with maxlevel 1) that this would only allow refiling into my todo.org file as top-level headlines. I don&#x27;t want to see existing headlines as autocomplete options for that file, if I type &quot;todo&quot; I only want to see &quot;todo.org&quot;. For projects.org (with maxlevel 2) I want to see the top-level headlines, and nothing lower. Is this possible? Is helm messing this up?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;d like to do some well-defined modifications on links that point to locations in org-files.
 My goal is to replace the search string in the link with the line number. For example, convert
 [[file:file-path::search-string][description]]
 to
 [[file:file-path::1][description]]
 I am looking for a function that returns the link&#x27;s target and description as well as the regions where they reside. I can write one, but I&#x27;d prefer something that already ships with org.
 Thank you,
 Mirko

                              <span>I’ve previously used https://github.com/alphapapa/org-rifle but it relies on Helm, which I don’t use anymore. 
 Is there a better way to search / fuzzy search all agenda files or all org / org roam files? 
 Currently using Doom.

 I&#x27;ve got the same config running on my Linux machine - where the org timestamp behavior works as expected. Reinstalling emacs and Doom (brew install emacs-mac) has not solved the problem. 
 Google, Stack Exchange and Reddit search have yielded no luck. Anyone else seen this behavior / have any ideas?

                              <span>So many people crying about how Scala is supposedly dying and getting &quot;replaced&quot; by languages like Kotlin. Yes, Scala has some problems but seriously this is becoming ridiculous.
 Where would Kotlin be without Android? Probably dead. And what does it have over sbt? As if Gradle were any better. Each time I&#x27;m upgrading my JDK, Gradle starts crying about not supporting the latest JDK and wants me to download a whole new wrapper for it. Same goes for Rust. I don&#x27;t know why you would compare Rust to Scala. Besides, both Rust and Cargo have their own set of problems. 
 Seriously, I feel like there&#x27;s a bunch of people who intentionally bad-mouth Scala to make their &quot;own&quot; langauges look better.

I am relatively new to all this PKM stuff! In the time that I spent thinking about knowledge, ideas, learning, note-taking, etc. I concluded that the Zettelkasten framework has a lot of power and simplicity among other frameworks.
I am yet to understand many things so I might be asking a lot of beginner questions here and wish to contribute as I progress forward!
Happy to be here!</span>

 I&#x27;m currently working on generating assembly code using the CodeGen.X86 module, but I&#x27;m struggling to find any useful documentation beyond the dry one on Hackage. 
 Does anyone know of any other documentation or have any experience using this module in a project? I would really appreciate any help or advice that you can give me.
 Thanks so much in advance!

                              <span>This is not really a haskell question, but is very easily expressed in haskell constructs. Two common ways to sort lists are sortOn :: Ord b &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] and sortBy :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]. My question is this: Can sortBy be implemented via sortOn (a la the title, for all cmpFn)? Since I&#x27;m assuming the answer is &quot;no&quot;, is there a good way to tell, for a given cmpFn if sortBy cmpFn can be implemented as sortOn fn?

 Are there any good text-based diagramming tools that one can use to get inline diagrams? Maybe graphviz or tikz?

                              <span>Hi,
 I want to use flyspell with a hunspell backed. I prefer hunspell because it offers multilanguage dictionaries which can be very useful for me. My configuration is:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq +v/LANG &quot;en_GB&quot; +v/DICPATH &quot;/Users/me/Library/Spelling/&quot; +v/MULTIDIC &quot;en_GB,en_US,de_DE&quot;)
 (use-package flyspell :straight t :after ispell :init ;; Set the locale for the dictionary (if (string-equal system-type &quot;darwin&quot;) (setenv &quot;DICTIONARY&quot; &quot;en_GB&quot;))
 (setenv &quot;LANG&quot; +v/LANG)
 ;; Dictionary path (setenv &quot;DICPATH&quot; +v/DICPATH)
 :config ;; Use hunspell (setq ispell-program-name &quot;hunspell&quot;) (setq ispell-really-hunspell t)
 ;; ispell-set-spellchecker-params has to be called ;; before ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic will work (ispell-set-spellchecker-params)
 ;; Declare a multi-language dictionary and switch to it (ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic +v/MULTIDIC) (ispell-change-dictionary +v/MULTIDIC t)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, this does not work. My dictionary folder is populated like so: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ tree ~/Library/Spelling /Users/tc/Library/Spelling ├── dynamic-counts.dat ├── en_GB.aff ├── en_GB.dic ├── en_US.aff ├── en_US.dic ├── fr_FR.aff ├── fr_FR.dic ├── it_IT.aff └── it_IT.dic
 1 directory, 9 files &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 While hunspell is detected, it fails to detect any dictionary :( I test this like so: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ hunspell Hunspell 1.7.2 welcome
 welcome 0
 test
 test 0

 Test 0
 test 0
 Running M-x replace-string from test 0 to test 1 changes the lines above to:
 test 1
 test 1
 I want the first line to be kept capitalized, i.e. Test 1.
 Thanks.

 Any help is appreciated, thank you so much.

                              <span>When dealing with log files, I find the Auto-revert-mode is useful to monitor the changes. However, it can also consume more system resources, particularly on large files which updates frequently over tramp. I want a simple solution where a single key-press can update the log file on demand. Moreover, I don&#x27;t want to accidentally edit it so I want the read-only mode with single key-press update feature. I have the following pipeline:
  
Open the log file and convert to read-only-mode (C-x C-q key-press).
 When read-only-mode is activated then we remap the &#x27;g&#x27; key to the revert-buffer. One possible solution is to use &#x60;current-local-map&#x60; function but the downside is that remapping will be activated in all the files opened with that major-mode.

                              <span>Hi all,
 pretty much the title question. I asked the same on r/lisp but I realize it&#x27;s better suited here. I like Edebug because it allows to follow the computation even in a single form, from the inside out. Like, given something like
 (+ 3 (/ 4 n))
 I can see exactly not only what n is, but also what are the intermediate results. The closest thing I found for now is Sly&#x27;s stickers, but I wondered if there was an actual equivalent. Otherwise, I find CL&#x27;s debugger a bit difficult to use in step-mode, but that could easily being me not having read the manual thoroughly. So, does a CL-Edebug exist, much like CIDER&#x27;s for Clojure? And if not, can I use SLIME/Sly to step between forms (from inside out)?
 P.S., IIUC Sly is the improved (better?) version of SLIME. Is it right?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use org-capture and doct to insert entries in an org file. The content it needs to insert is not always the same, but the position in the file is. I&#x27;ve written my function to go to the correct position and tried with %c to capture and insert the latest value in the kill ring that I populated with the hook function that prompts me for a contact and formats it correctly.
  (let ((org-capture-templates (doct &#x60;(&quot;new item&quot; :keys &quot;i&quot; :type entry :template &quot;* %c&quot; :function my/goto-current-project-contacts :hook ,(kill-new (completing-read &quot;Select contact: &quot; (org-ql-select my/contacts-file &#x27;(level 1) :action #&#x27;my/contact-format))) :immediate-finish t)))) (org-capture nil &quot;i&quot;)) 
 However this gives me an error:
 doct--convert-declaration-maybe: DOCT Wrong type argument: (functionp doct--variable-p null), (:hook &quot;selected contact&quot;), (&quot;new item&quot; :keys &quot;i&quot; :type entry :template &quot;* %c&quot; :function my/current-project-contacts :hook &quot;selected contact&quot; :immediate-finish t)
 EDIT: I just discovered you can use progn in the template string. Should this not be added to the wiki or am I blind and looked over it for a couple of times? https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html
 So this works:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun testtest () (completing-read &quot;Select contact: &quot; (org-ql-select my/contacts-file &#x27;(level 1) :action #&#x27;my/contact-format)))
 (let ((org-capture-templates (doct (&quot;new item&quot; :keys &quot;i&quot; :type entry :template &quot;* %(progn (testtest))&quot; :function my/goto-current-project-contacts :immediate-finish t)))) (org-capture nil &quot;i&quot;)) &#x60;&#x60;
 Can I move the testtest function into the template so I don&#x27;t need to declare it separately? I can&#x27;t seem to figure out the quotes of the &quot;Select contact: &quot; string.

 Did anyone face the issue I described in the title? Here is an example:

 ** Heading 1 Some text *** Heading 2 Some text

                              <span>I struggled a few days, and finally success building feature/android branch of my fork of Emacs repo(forked from mirror of Emacs on savannah) with Github Actions.
 I was looking for as such, because I donnot have android development environment.
 If there is Emacs user on android like me, it will little help such problem.
 To use this, it requires only a few,
  
Mirror/Fork Emacs repositry from repositry on savannah or gitlab , or emacs-mirror repositry on github self(my case, https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/).
 
Create Github Actions&#x27; workflow(simply add [https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) to the repository, and enable workflow from Github web UI).
 
Change the permission of the workflow from &#x27;Read repository contents permission&#x27; to &#x27;Read and write permissions&#x27;(also from Github web UI).
 
 If you check ./configure step, you will notice this workflow could work very limited target(me), but adjust ./configure option if architecture it may work your architecture of android device.
 ※ I donnot have any android development experience since, I often run another workflow[https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/.github/workflows/build.yml](learn_android.yml) to adjust configure cited in [https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/java/INSTALL](java/INSTALL).
 I hope this will help.

 First, subdomains have been replaced by subpaths. For example, the documentation for my purescript-tecton library can be found at purescri.pt/tecton. Accordingly, PureScript Domains is now PureScript Domain (although previously-registered subdomains remain active).
 Second, a purescri.pt URL will automatically be activated for any package added to purescri.pt/registry. By default, it will redirect to the corresponding GitHub repository, but you can change this behavior or opt out through a simple pull request.
 If you would like to participate, please visit purescri.pt for details.
 Thanks for reading!

I&#x27;ll start.
I finally released my project that extends The Archive, showing an &quot;Idea Explorer&quot; on demand for every note. This can be thought of as a way to look at &quot;note sequences.&quot; Sequences that develop an idea. I&#x27;m looking for collaborators to develop this idea further. Idea Explorer - an extension exclusively for The Archive.
This past week I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to practice and work on my technique for onboarding videos into my ZK. Speed and timing are critical—speed in taking notes and timing in reviewing the event. I feel I&#x27;ve gained a little success making a rough, rough draft during the presentation, then immediately after, as part of the process of watching a video, I expand my notes as I would if they were highlights from an article. Having a few minutes of uninterrupted time immediately after the video presentation to fill in my thoughts on my note is critical.
I&#x27;m looking to do more of this. I get excited when I onboard live streams or Zoom events more than videos where I can start, stop, and replay the action. They feel more dynamic, and they spark my juices.
Maybe I should try sketch-noting. It just feels like my skills at sketching are so poor that I&#x27;d miss stuff with the fast pace of a live presentation. Maybe this would be best reserved for youtube videos.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using org-roam for a while, and it&#x27;s going great; however, I sense some inconvenience with having a big amount of encrypted org files, especially when they don&#x27;t use the same key. This makes it much harder to search through the notes since I&#x27;ve to decrypt them each. So I was thinking if giving up the mix for having all the notes to be encrypted in one directory would fix that, like having all the notes encrypted by default but all of them also decrypt at once, so they become easier to search &amp; query. But I don&#x27;t know even how to do that, the best came to my mind is to encrypt the directory itself, but I also have no idea of how this can be done :P 
 Any suggestions? 
 p.s. I use disk encryption already if that matters, but I want extra protection.

                              <span>Hello,
 I would like to use Emacs for everything, and currently my E-Mail is the last thing that is missing.
 Currently, my Neomutt is set up with the following in mind:
  
POP3. I download it to maildirs with mpop for several accounts
 msmtp is configured for the same accounts
 Abook is used for address book
  
Which client, methods, etc. would you recommend so that I can continue using the already set up mpop with maildirs and msmtp, with multiple accounts?
 Abook is not necessary, as I bet there are ways to keep contact information in Emacs?
 Thanks in advance.

 was frustrated with installing emacs through apt (ubuntu 22.10) so i went into my /bin and deleted everything emacs related. i installed the flatpak, hated the UI and wanted to install emacs with apt again, only for it to say it was &quot;downloaded&quot;, but it never populated my /bin again.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have my init.org tangled to 3 different files (vanilla emacs) : - init.el - linux.el - windows.el My config has been written under Linux.
 I have set a few variables so that the right el is loaded depending on the machine it is loaded on (linux vs windows). I have removed the eln cache, the whole straight directory, so that everything is downloaded againwhen installing on the Windows machine..
 And I get the following error message when starting emacs 28 on Windows.
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable dbus-registered-objects-table) dbus-unregister-service(:session &quot;org.freedesktop.Notifications&quot;) ednc--stop-server() ednc-mode(-1) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;c:/Users/frederic.mougel/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; &quot;c:/Users/frederic.mougel/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; t t) load(&quot;c:/Users/frederic.mougel/.emacs.d/init&quot; noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #) #f(compiled-function () #) t) command-line() normal-top-level()  I have searched for dbus or freedesktop in my emacs.d, did not find any mention of them.
 Do you have any idea where/why a linux module dbus inevitable is? I am lost here... Thanks for your help

 Part of the functionality I would like to have is executable source blocks in my org files, the issue is that sending code to a remote emacs instance and sending the results right back sounds like some kind of security nightmare. So I need to sandbox it.
 One option I&#x27;ve considered is using a docker container (or similar), I feel like there is a better approach though. Have any of you done anything like this?

                              <span>Hi y&#x27;all
 After starting with emacs-lisp, I fell into kind of a rabbit hole, and now I&#x27;d like to use emacs-lisp and or the common-lisp extension to rework some kinks in my personal configuration.
 I have found some good resources myself, but I simply trust this community more than search engines or ChatGPT.
 Often there isn&#x27;t any correct way to program something. But there always are exponential amount of horrible ways to program something. And many of those bad solutions get the job done in finite time and with finite resources.
 [disclaimer: while likely irrelevant in this case, I do use doom emacs] 
 After my last question I spend some time learning more about programming generally, as well as lisp syntax. So now I feel I have bit better understanding of emacs-lisp thanks to that. I act…</span>

 I have company installed with among others the company-elisp backend, but no elisp functions completion. This comes from doom emacs by the way.
 Thanks for the info.

                              <span>Dear r/emacs community,
 We are researchers at Inria (EP Loki) studying how users automate frequent actions in their daily use of interactive software (e.g., macros in Emacs, actions in Blender, or actions in the Adobe Suite). We recently created a questionnaire that takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete and are looking for participants (we tried to shorten it as much as we could). We unfortunately cannot offer compensation for that, but are hoping data from volunteers will help us design more customizable systems on the long term. Any help would be deeply appreciated.
 Questionnaire : https://expe.lille.inria.fr/limesurvey/index.php/526753?lang&#x3D;en&amp;community&#x3D;emacs
 If this research is of any interest to you, we are also looking for participants to interview about their specific solutions to automate frequent actions. Please contact use if you are willing to share your experience, our emails are available in the first page of the questionnaire or you can simply DM me.
 Note: be aware our questionnaire relies on LimeSurvey which uses non-libre JS libraries.

                              <span>lam is a tool to quickly define, use and discard buffer local abbrevs: https://github.com/ChanderG/lam 
 Normally abbrevs are either global or major-mode specific. This adds a certain friction - you would need to think about the abbrev naming (can&#x27;t freely use short names) and the importance/frequency of the abbrev.
 Instead, lam allows you to quickly define context specific abbrevs on the fly. The best part is that since abbrevs can execute elisp, you can do a lot more than just simple text expansions. 
 Want to hear from you on how you use abbrevs and if this approach can open up new workflows for you.

                              <span>I am writing a HOF which basically takes a function as argument.
 But this argument function has to be generic and also has to be applied inside the HOF.
 Ex: def foo(fn: (A, B) &#x3D;&gt; C, a: A, b: B) &#x3D; { //some decision control statement fn(a, b) }
 def foo(fn: (D, E, F) &#x3D;&gt; H, d: D, e: E, f: F &#x3D; { fn(d, e, f) }
 how can I write one foo function which can take lots of variations of fn?

                              <span>Hi all, Linux focused content creator, I currently use Obsidian to store my video ideas and scripts/research. I am trying to focus on including both the visual and audio portion of the script now. Obsidian has multi-column mode, but I&#x27;m unable to edit the columns side by side. I find having the columns under each other in editing view to hinder me trying to think through the process.
 This got me thinking, I should open two files side by side, a _audio and _visual file. I could kind of do this in Obsidian, though with the current way kanban works, it would not be an ideal setup. I&#x27;d have to link the audio or visual (or both) file to the entry from kanban. This seems like it would get difficult to deal with after a while.
 This has led me to think about neovim with markdown fi…</span>

                              <span>I would LOVE to use the language. I learnt the basics, wrote some simple programs. But the whole tooling (stack, cabal, hls, ghcup etc.) just confuses and frustrates me because NOTHING works (atleast not without hours of trying). I just want my vscode setup so it shows me errors and warnings and maybe type signatures (hls), but i just always get errors when i want to import modules, for example:
  Multi Cradle: No prefixes matched pwd: c:\Users\nubch\Documents\haskell\tictactoe\tictactoe2 filepath: C:\Users\nubch\Documents\haskell\tictactoe\tictactoe2\app\Libr.hs prefixes: (&quot;app/Main.hs&quot;,Cabal {component &#x3D; Just &quot;tictactoe2:exe:tictactoe2&quot;}) 
 Can someone PLEASE give me an overview what everything is and how to set it up so that is just works. The last weeks I always want to program and learn the language but i just waste hours because something doesnt work. its terrible, i just want to code.
 ​
 I have stack and cabal installed and hls in vscode. I just want to make a simple program, where do I start? Should I use cabal or stack, or none?

                              <span>I would like to test a function that processes a partition of a list, for example
 concat&#x27; :: [[a]] -&gt; [a] concat&#x27; &#x3D; foldr (++) [] 
 For any partition of a list I would like to test the property concat&#x27; . anyPartition &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; id. So I thought about something like this (pseudo code):
 property $ \xs -&gt; concat&#x27; (anyPartition xs) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; xs 
 Of course anyPartition can&#x27;t be a pure function. As a first step I tried to create a function
 partitionOf :: [a] -&gt; Gen [[a]] partitionOf [] &#x3D; return [] partitionOf xs &#x3D; do i  partitionOf cs 
 but I don&#x27;t know how to write a property test with a function like that. Do I need an Arbitrary ([a] -&gt; Gen [[a]]) instance for it? How does this instance from Test.QuickCheck help?
  (CoArbitrary a, Arbitrary b) &#x3D;&gt; Arbitrary (a -&gt; b) 
 What&#x27;s the best way to accomplish this partition handling test? Most of these things like Gen, Arbitrary and CoArbitrary are pretty new to me.

                              <span>Who invented this? Why this triplet? What was the logic behind it?Map comes from functor, but what about the others and how to generalize the idea of the original people that set this up.Thank you very much for your time
 Edit: a person on 4chan directed me to the MapReduce programming model. Apparently, it was not the exact origin because they got the idea from Lisp:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce#cite_note-map-5
 Lisp developed map as part of their goal to create list programs (unbounded arguments functions). They implemented, as part of that, recursion and functionals (functions that take functions as arguments). map was part of that:
 http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/lisp.html 
 And reduce and filter are called catamorphism now. So that would be the track to figure out the origin and to generalize the concept.

This will be a video introducing an extension for The Archive. Designed for The Archive with plain text with wikilinks in mind. My ideas for this script are modeled after the public musings of Soren Bjornstad. The Idea Explorer is an idea that can help surface interesting relationships by looking at age, modification times, word count, and the prevalence of incoming and outgoing links. And more relevance can be &quot;fished out of the idea pond&quot; in the future.

This requires The Archive, Keyboard Maestro, and Python 3.9+.

 It appears I have everything set up correctly, but authentication is not working, and it looks like it&#x27;s trying to make the calls with an invalid token.
 I have also tried making the calls using my token directly through curl, and I&#x27;m getting the same errors.
 Is anyone out there successfully connecting?
 Thanks!

 The circumference of a unit circle is $$C&#x3D;2\pi{}&#x3D;&#x60;r 2*pi&#x60;.$$ 
 Is it possible to have inline code evaluated as well in a math environment in Org mode? I have tried this but it does not work.

                              <span>I have monolithical scala 2 application with dependencies on slick and other stuff, where to other stuff includes the cats ecosystem. The slick dependency means I have no business case migrating it to scala 3 until slick does, which I&#x27;m not holding my breath for.
 I&#x27;m looking to split it apart, initially by pulling modules out and making them separate projects. These generally will not have the slick dependency keeping me on scala 2, but will often have cats dependencies.
 Is there a way I can start using scala 3 features in this project? I can publish for scala 3, and use the for213use3 functionality in my depending project, but then I will have binary incompatibilies between cats for scala 2 and cats for scala 3.
 Crossbuilding the dependency doesn&#x27;t get me anywhere, because then I still can&#x27;t use scala 3 features.
 What&#x27;s my road ahead here, if any?

 Enjoy!

 A desktop example is here:

 I will post a mobile example too since the idea is to have a single parser for both.
 if you also add ?dev to the url i.e http://127.0.0.1/index.html?dev then you can actually edit the script and use the browser as a development platform.

                              <span>I’m new to scala and a legacy code base, we have performance issues and after looking at metrics, most of the times threads are blocked because we are using await for long io tasks.
 I started refactoring the code to properly use futures and it became a complex change with little room for incremental testing. 
 Any suggestions for how to deal with this?

 Does anyone know how to add a 4th choice which is &quot;show me the diff between my buffer and the saved file on the disk, possibly in another window?
 Thanks for your feedback.

 What&#x27;s the best way to only set them on Windows and also quiet the byte compiler? I can&#x27;t wrap the whole form in eval-when-compile. I could make the whole thing a macro that does nothing on non-Windows, but that seems overly complicated.
 Also a related question if I may: I&#x27;d like to replace the above setqs with defvar but in such a way that it always sets my value, not just if the var is undefined. Is there a standard way to do that?

                              <span>Is it possible to make it so tab-line mode line appears on a top of each buffer as opposed to on each window individually? *(in emacs term &#x60;window&#x60; are the splits that are inside a frame, not gui window in traditional sense, i know confusing)*
 In image below this is my emacs frame, and it has tab lines from global-tab-line-mode repeated 3 times on each window (the lines with *scratch* init.el etc.), and i want to see only one tab line at top of the frame.

                              <span>Does anyone here use the native Emacs port for Android? It looks so great and has so much potential! 
 For the people using it: what keybindings did you set up? My smartphone has 3 programmable physical buttons: volume-up, volume-down, camera-shoot (actually there&#x27;s also a 4th key: camera-focus) and i was thinking to set them up as modifiers. Also, the toolbar could be placed on the bottom of the screen and include some commands like &quot;context-menu-open&quot; or &quot;M-x&quot;. 
 Share your config for Android, if you have one!

                              <span>My find-file always starts in $HOME.
 This is OK when starting Emacs for the first time.
 But using it after that I would like to start in the folder the currents buffers file belongs to or in the folder I latest opened a file from.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m wrong about the current buffers file folder. This works. But what if there is no file open. Then find-file should use the latest default-directory that was setup instead of the initial (after start) default-directory.

 However, how do I wildcard with #+INCLUDE? I would like to include all org files in a certain directory. Tried: #+INCLUDE: &quot;nameoffolder/*.org&quot;. Would be nice not needing to write out each file as I add them to that folder.

I erase the &quot;nil&quot; value that it is set to (I don&#x27;t know why) and restore the original value to get the dot, and save and then the dot appears when I reload dashboard. But I can&#x27;t save the customization permanently. It disappears and reverts to nil for the next session. In customize it tells me, &quot;CHANGED outside Customize. (mismatch)&quot; and the option to &quot;Apply and Save&quot; is greyed out. But I do not have that variable set anywhere in my init.el or my custom.el. So I am at a loss what is going. If anyone could explain why I am unable to set this variable, I&#x27;d appreciate it.

                              <span>While I absolutely adore the new pixel scroll precision mode, allowing me to finally have some good smooth scrolling on buffers, it seems to break scrolling in some places. Do note that when I talk about scrolling in this context, I mean with the mouse wheel (which I&#x27;ve configured to smoothly scroll, as you would on a web browser for instance).
 For example, doc-view mode. If you try to scroll with pixel scroll precision enabled, you&#x27;ll get sent to the top of the buffer, and going up or down just says &quot;beggining of buffer&quot; or &quot;end of buffer&quot;. Vertico is also broken, resulting in the same error. The corfu popup is broken as well.
 Anyone knows why it&#x27;s broken? Any fix or workaround? This is my config for this mode btw:
 (setq-default scroll-conservatively 10000) (setq-default scroll-margin 5) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 10.0) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-page t) (pixel-scroll-precision-mode t) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-down) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-up)

                              <span>What&#x27;s a good solution for making interactive web animations using Haskell? I want to be able to animate reduction graphs and include math symbols.
 The interactivity could be as simple as slowing/speeding the animation, and allowing for automatic &quot;stop points&quot;, like a slide show. Or it could go as far as to allow the content to be dynamically generated by user input. And perhaps people could click on graph nodes and see them expand.
 Reanimate sounds almost ideal, with its support for LaTeX. But unfortunately, it is all rendered in batch, not providing for any interactivity.
 FRP solutions sound very attractive. But reflex seems to be stuck on the outdated GHCJS, and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to build (using macOS on Apple Silicon). The newer JS output in GHC doesn&#x27;t yet have DOM support. And even if I used one of those, figuring out how to interact with a LaTeX renderer might be tricky.
 The diagrams library supports some animation, but it&#x27;s limited, and the never-seems-to-be-arriving version 2.0 is supposed to replace the animation support with something new.
 Another closely related option is Purescript, which seems to have a few FRP libraries, but I&#x27;m not sure how well any of them will work for this application.
 Another option would be to use or interface with a JavaScript library that does interactive animations, such as paper.js or Greensock.
 I figure that depending on the animation, pre-rendering some content may be desirable for performance, and that could be tricky.
 I&#x27;m leaning toward using Reanimate because, even though I have to give up on interactivity, it seems to have excellent support for LaTeX integration. So it&#x27;s probably easiest for prototyping, and I could switch to some other toolset later once I know what I want it to look like.

                              <span>Hello, Haskell has inspired me to take a look at type theory. I started reading the book Type Theory and Formal Proof. The book explains several type systems such as λ2, λω and λC but none of them happen to capture all of Haskell&#x27;s type system. They specifically miss the idea of type classes. That got me wondering what type system does Haskell use?
 Thanks!
 PS: I assumed here that Haskell is based on type theory. I have been told that several times.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 So I&#x27;m trying to model collectible coins using Haskell, and I&#x27;ve hit a bit of a roadblock with figuring out the best approach.
 Basically, each coin has a denomination, year, and mint. However, not all combinations of these three are valid. For example, a coin with denomination GR1 from the year 1923 could only have come from the Warsaw mint. On the other hand, the same denomination in a different year might belong to the Paris mint.
 My initial thought was to enforce these constraints using a smart constructor, but since this is a pet project aimed at learning, I would prefer to check it at compile time if possible.
 Here&#x27;s the model I&#x27;ve come up with so far:
 data Denomination &#x3D; ZL10 | ZL5 | ZL2 | ZL1 | GR50 | GR20 | GR10 | GR5 | GR2 | GR1 deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum) data Mint &#x3D; Warsaw | Paris | Birmingham deriving (Eq, Show, Bounded, Enum) type family OneOf xs where OneOf &#x27;[] &#x3D; Not IdPred OneOf (x : xs) &#x3D; Or (EqualTo x) (OneOf xs) type Years a &#x3D; Refined (OneOf a) Year newtype Year &#x3D; Year {getYear :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, TextShow, Show, Lift) type GR1EmissionYears &#x3D; Years &#x27;[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR2EmissionYears &#x3D; Years &#x27;[1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR5EmissionYears &#x3D; Years &#x27;[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] -- [...] 
 I could of course glue it all into a single union type, listing all the cases explicitly:
 data Coins &#x3D; Gr1Warsaw1937 | Gr1Paris1937 | Gr1Paris1939 - ... 
 But that will make it quite hard to e.g. filter and extract all coins of year 1937.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this problem. Do I need dependent types for this? Is there any simpler way?

                              <span>I recognize that asking such a question might seem peculiar; however, please allow me to elaborate. My journey with Linux has led me to an insatiable desire for optimization, beginning with vim/neovim and permeating nearly every aspect of my digital life. I have hand-crafted scripts for everything. The only thing left is to unify my coding and writing experience in one place.
 I use vim for coding, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. However, when it comes to writing, the visual representation of equations and figures help me concentrate on content. While vimtex (a vim plugin) offers a solution for creating LaTeX-based PDFs, the fusion of code and text hinders my thought process. For me, writing on a computer has to be similar to putting pen on a paper, where the focus is on content, not on the representation. For this reason, I sought an alternative solution and my search led me to TeXmacs. Here&#x27;s how my notes look. No ugly LaTex -- equations/figures look nice, etc.
 TeXmacs is nice and all, except that it&#x27;s not vim. I can&#x27;t use all of my fancy plugins (jump between files, write custom snippets, define custom actions, etc). It seems that emacs can be made just as powerful as vim, while also having the ability to display inline equations and images. This seems like the answer to all my questions, except that I only looking at the positives. I hesitate to succumb to the illusion of greener pastures, as vim has served me impeccably, save for the aforementioned limitations. Thus, I must ask: is Emacs the solution I seek?

                              <span>Hi,
 Sorry for cross-posting. I asked this on r/orgmode. However, I have not received any answer or suggestions there. I see that this reddit is far more active, and there are likely to be many expert users of orgmode here. So hopefully someone can suggest a solution. Thank you.
 New to org mode (used it briefly about 8-10 years ago). It is great. However, I would find it more helpful if I could do the following. Please see the example below with checkboxes.
 * Question - [X] Box 1 Some notes on Box 1 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. - [X] Another Box: box 2 Some notes on box 2 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. 
 When I check the boxes next to Box 1 and &quot;Another Box: box 2&quot; the lines &quot;Box 1&quot; and &quot;Another Box: box 2&quot; are grayed out (originally they are white when the boxes are not checked). This is great and I like that. However, the &quot;Some notes...when it is done&quot; are not grayed out even after the boxes are checked. They stay white. Is there an easy way to ensure that any notes below a checkbox are also grayed out when the checkbox is checked? Do I have to, or can I, mark it as notes or something else which would give this effect? Thank you.

                              <span>I am running a process that generates as significant amount of data (using start-process-shell-command).
 Everything works, but while profiling the code I have noticed that most time is spend capturing the output of the command. Looking at the processes output buffer, I think the reason is that this buffer (even though it is fundamental) is running several minor modes that are making things slower.
 How could I disable all minor modes in a buffer? I have tried this function, but it does not seem to work:
  (defun disable-all-minor-modes () &quot;Disable all minor modes in the current buffer.&quot; (interactive) (let ((mode-maps (buffer-local-value &#x27;minor-mode-map-alist (current-buffer)))) (dolist (mode mode-maps) (message &quot;mode [%s]&quot; (car mode)) (funcall (car mode) -1)) ) )) 
 thank you in advance
 p.s. I tried to write my own capture function, but it ended being wayyyy slower.

 I would like to show a buffer in side window but I don&#x27;t want to switch to this window.
 I remember there is an option like (allow-no-window) but this one wont enable to show the buffer ...
 When you use the C-x o then it will ignore/skip this window with this parameter 
 Please help me, I can&#x27;t find this parameter!
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m working in Emacs 28.2 (on openSUSE Tumbleweed). On this version only (not in previous versions), the header font for Org mode third level headers is extremely tiny, and only for those headers. That is, for characters preceded by &#x27;***&#x27;, the font is very compressed and completely unreadable, although still red in color, as they should be.
 ​
 It&#x27;s definitely an annoyance, any suggestions?

 A library to easily define git repo specific hydras. You can define a hydra for a git repo my-project like this:
 (repo-hydra-define &quot;my-project&quot; (&quot;i&quot; text-scale-increase &quot;In&quot;) (&quot;o&quot; text-scale-decrease &quot;Out&quot;)) 
 And call it from within the repo with M-x repo-hydra-show RET. So only one command for all repo specific hydras.

 - Which shortcut to use.
 - Number of loaded packages
 - Startup time
 - Weather information - only Celsius for now. Yes, the icons changes according to weather.

                              <span>For systems where I can&#x27;t install external packages I use builtin snippet functionalities like tempo and expand and I can easily change between either of them. The expansions happen when I press space that makes it annoying when editing or just typing the the strings that trigger expansions. How do I make it so that this expansions happen on a specific key-combination and rather than space and how would I inhibit this expansion when space is pressed.
 I think both of them use abbrev based expansions but are not controlled by the functions and variables that control abbrev expansion.

                              <span>hej fellows,
 If I have a long line in a posframe, the cursor is moved to end of line, which results in beginning of line becoming invisible and making entries hard to discern. How do I fix that?
 Have a good day and thanks :)

                              <span>I am currently running emacs 29 (built from emacs-29 branch) which – according to https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot – should contain the latest eglot.
 Now they added the eglot-upgrade-eglot command, which is supposed to update to the latest ELPA version.
 Looking into emacs-29 code, the version is currently 1.12.29, while list-packages shows version 1.15 (gnu), so installing the package might also bring in a newer one.
 I have no idea how to keep up with the latest version (without having to call the package specific eglot-upgrade-eglot function), especially when emacs 29 will be released and I won’t build from source any more.
 I followed the emacs-devel discussion (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2023-04/msg00782.html), but now I’m even more confused. Any advice?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 In my team we do use zio quite a bit in our codebase, usually with for-comprehensions. I just discovered the zio-direct project and it looks promising. The direct coding style can be a lot simpler to work with and more familiar to folks who are new to FP. I was wondering what has been people&#x27;s experience with moving to zio-direct. What worked well and what didn&#x27;t? Any gotchas one needs to be aware of? What are some reasons moving to zio-direct might be a bad idea?
 Thanks

Should we take them as a resource until we identify some &quot;zettels&quot; among them?</span>

 Changes since v2.9.3:

 Removed --ghc-paths, --global-stack-root and --local-bin-path flags for stack path, deprecated in Stack 1.1.0 in favour of --programs, --stack-root and local-bin respectively.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1394mvt/what_is_the_right_way_to_use_orgagendafilter_with/">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>So I use tags for my org tasks like: @anywhere, @computer, @work, and @home. There&#x27;s a hierarchical structure here, sort of like this:
 @anywhere @computer @work @home 
 So from my agenda, I&#x27;d like to be able to filter for e.g. @work when I&#x27;m on my work computer, and have all tasks labeled as @anywhere, @computer, or @work show up. The problem is, org&#x27;s Tag Hierarchy seems to work in the opposite way that I want; when I create a hierarchy like this:
 (setq org-tag-alist &#x27;((:startgrouptag) (&quot;@anywhere&quot;) (:grouptags) (:startgrouptag) (&quot;@computer&quot;) (:grouptags) (&quot;@work&quot;) (&quot;@home&quot;) (:endgrouptag) (:endgrouptag)) 
 Then filter by e.g. @work, I only get @work-tagged entries. On the other hand, when I reverse the hierarchy like this:
 (setq org-tag-alist &#x27;((:startgrouptag) (&quot;@work&quot;) (:grouptags) (&quot;@anywhere&quot;) (&quot;@computer&quot;) (:endgrouptag) (:startgrouptag) (&quot;@home&quot;) (:grouptags) (&quot;@anywhere&quot;) (&quot;@computer&quot;) (:endgrouptag)) 
 I can filter by @work or @home and get the results I want, however I can&#x27;t filter by @computer and see all @work/@home/@computer/@anywhere-tagged entries. And, unfortunately, if I add a grouptag section for @computer, it includes children of that group in @work and @home now, corrupting those groups.
 So my question is: is there a better way to filter to include a child in a hierarchy OR its parents? FWIW I&#x27;ve also tried using the | operator in my filter query (e.g. @work|@anywhere) but org doesn&#x27;t seem to parse it, and it does no filtering (it gives me a message like @work|@anywhere filter ignored because tag/category is not represented).
 ​
 (btw, I&#x27;m using doom emacs, in case that happens to be relevant here)

                              <span>some command names dont make sense to me
 ie. viewing backlinks in org-roam is &quot;org-roam-buffer-toggle&quot;
 can i add an alias to the command name, so it could appear as &quot;org-roam-buffer-toggle (view-backlinks)&quot;

There is a lot of &#x27;ifs&#x27; with &#x27;agenda view&#x27; which adds a lot of complexity to code. I&#x27;m curious how other people use this feature. I have not found any screenshots or video with it.
 Could you post some screenshots? And write for what you are using it?

 I do not want to use minted. Is it possible to configure this from an init file so that any org-file w/ an SRC block gets exported to latex with the given settings? If it&#x27;s possible to get numbering w/ engravefaces I&#x27;d be ok looking into that too.

 Just putting this out there in case anyone one thought that they accidentally broken their config like I did : (

                              <span>Genuine question. I know Vertico is already pretty close to built-in (uses many built-in emacs features unlike Helm) but I&#x27;d like what they can do when compared to fido-vertical-mode.
 I tried installing Vertico and consult but I just can&#x27;t appreciate their additional features. What am I missing? I know they are powerful tools and I&#x27;d like to know what am i missing. 
 I also know that maybe i do not really need them if i can&#x27;t see their value, but I&#x27;m keen to know their strengths.

                              <span>I use Emacs (evil-mode) for extensive note-taking but don&#x27;t have much programming experience. Can someone help me with a function to copy visually selected text in org-mode to clipboard and exclude the org emphasis markers, e.g. selecting raw text +string+ copies to clipboard just string? org-copy-visible by itself doesn&#x27;t copy to system clipboard. Also, I don&#x27;t want to think about whether to use org-copy-visible or evil-yank--99% of the time I just want to evil-yank and also don&#x27;t want the emphasis markers copied to clipboard (e.g. copy paste to document or terminal).
 Basically:
  
Should rely on org-copy-visible which probably does a better job than trying to parse selected text using regex
 
Custom function or overloading evil-yank only for org-mode where org-copy-visible is relevant. I prefer to just use plain evil-yank in non-org-mode buffers instead of e.g. my\evil-yank that falls back to evil-yank since this is less efficient in scenarios where I&#x27;m working with non-org-mode buffers.
 
 Much appreciated.

 Is it possible to add to these the following behavior:
 - When one chords M-S-LEFT, if one has only one bullet then to remove it.; and vice versa, when there is no bullet and one chords M-S-RIGHT it inserts a bullet at the beginning of the line?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I noticed that when I run Emacs as a daemon the emacsclient -e &quot;(functions)&quot; runs with the buffer set as *server*.
 Suppose I have already an emacsclient instance with another buffer opened, for example &quot;sample.org&quot;. How can I ensure that if I run a function, such as emacsclient -e &quot;(flyspell-buffer)&quot;, the function is executed with the buffer being set correctly to &quot;sample.org&quot;?
 I am asking because I have noticed that emascsclient -e &quot;(buffer-name)&quot; returns *server* buffer all the time and it has weird behavior with functions that expect the buffer set correctly.
 Is there a way to do this from Emacs, without relying on the window manager?
 EDIT: There is no easy solution for this. I will just stick to Alt-x.

                              <span>It is unusual for text editors to come with the same kind of productivity tools as Emacs does. Especially on UNIX-like systems, people typically expect their software to be focused and useful for a dedicated purpose, yet GNU Emacs decides to do the opposite.
 What is the philosophy behind this design practice? Furthermore, how would a user benefit from these features if they decide to use them instead of using popular, dedicated third-party applications?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, I need to transform an org table from 
 | foo1 |
 | foo2 |
 | foo3 |
 | foo4 |
 | foo5 |
 | foo6 |
 | foo7 |
 | foo8 |
 | foo9 |
 | foo10 |
 To a text like this:
 foo1
 + foo3
 + foo4
 + foo5
 + foo6
 Bar: foo8
 That is: I need to get rid of the vertical bars, trailing whitespaces and of some fixed lines (lines 2, 7, 9 and 10), and then I need to prepend certain lines (3-6) with &quot;+ &quot; and another line (line 8) with &quot;Bar: &quot;.
 I tried with macros but it gets too complex, so I guess I need to write a function to do just that. I&#x27;m not elisp fluent at all and I&#x27;m hoping the elisp wizards can give me a hand. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I know there is a new feature in Emacs (I think since 29) that you could enable to make Emacs act more like other modern Desktop programs, where you could scroll with the mouse wheel and the view would change, but the position of the point remains where it is. When the point is then moved to (via arrow key for example) the view would jump back to the point. 
 I know I read this somewhere, but I just can not find it. Someone know what I mean?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi! 
 Big release from HuggingFace this week. They released a large, language model for code (https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder). It has 15.5B parameters, 8192 context window, it was trained on permissively licensed code. Looks like it&#x27;s the best open alternative for copilot.
 There is also a VSCode extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName&#x3D;HuggingFace.huggingface-vscode 
 Nothing for Emacs, but I think adding it would not be that hard (the above extension itself is a fork of a TabNine extension). 
 Semi-related interesting post https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#reverse-engineering-preview on reverse engineering the copilot extension (how it prompts the LLM to add context about your project). Might be useful to add to the Emacs extension.

                              <span>I have a configuration where:
  
c-basic-offset is 4
 in c-offsets-alist, statement still has the default value of 0
 
in c-offsets-alist, cpp-define-intro set such that strings don&#x27;t have to be indented, like:
 #define MYSTR \ &quot;foo&quot; 
 
 So why do subsequent lines in multi-line strings get a 1-char indent:
 #define MYSTR \ &quot;foo\n&quot;\ &quot;bar&quot; 
 And I guess more importantly: How can I make Emacs not want to insert those spaces?
 (The goal is to configure Emacs to match the existing style of this existing codebase.)

                              <span>Hi, 
 New to org mode (used it briefly about 8-10 years ago). It is great. However, I would find it more helpful if I could do the following. Please see the example below with checkboxes.
 * Question - [X] Box 1 Some notes on Box 1 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. - [X] Another Box: box 2 Some notes on box 2 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. 
 When I check the boxes next to Box 1 and &quot;Another Box: box 2&quot; the lines &quot;Box 1&quot; and &quot;Another Box: box 2&quot; are grayed out (originally they are white when the boxes are not checked). This is great. However, the &quot;Some notes...when it is done&quot; are not grayed out even after the boxes are checked. They stay white. Is there an easy way to ensure that any notes below a checkbox are also grayed out when the checkbox is checked? Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using org mode tables to organize information and then generate a TSV so that it can be imported into Anki. I borrowed the following code to generate the TSV in the same file:
 #+name: org table to TSV for Anki
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var x&#x3D;notes :wrap example :results raw :colnames no
 (orgtbl-to-tsv x nil)
 #+END_SRC
 However, I get End of file during parsing if the first (non-whitespace) character of a cell is the double quotation marks (&quot;). Is there a way to escape the quote character without having it show up in the output? Currently if I use \&quot;, then the backslash will also be shown.
 Edit: for reference, the input line that is giving the error is: | &quot; | Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.|
 This is for an Anki deck comprising tmux keyboard shortcuts

Most of the time, I share an Apple note with my girlfriend so we can both keep track of goals or tasks we have in common. I would use another tool, but she is not into this basic geekery of markdown or linking notes; although at one point, we were deep into Workflowy and shared several nodes.&quot;</span>

 I have a git repo with multiple scala projects, and I am using emacs + eglot + metals.

 I have the Apple M1 chip, so maybe I should have used the curl -fL https://github.com ... command in the docs instead. Did I do something wrong?
 Appreciate the help! I haven&#x27;t been able to find results on Google since &quot;project&quot; and &quot;target&quot; are such generalized keywords.

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding myself defining &quot;ToJSON&quot;/&quot;FromJSON&quot; instances sometimes, as I don&#x27;t want to rely on the Generics based &quot;deriving anyclass&quot; serialiser to do this for me as it means:
  
I need to hack my datatype to fit the names and format I want for the JSON serialisation, not what makes most sense from an internal logic in workability sense.
 My design is then brittle to refactorings, even simple variable name chages.
  
I&#x27;m also using Servant+Swagger, and would like to keep the Swagger docs up to date, although defining the &quot;ToSchema&quot; swagger classes is even more complex.
 What just occurred to me is basically what I&#x27;m doing in each case is specifying how my data type maps to a Key/Value map, where Values can either be numbers, strings, arrays or key value maps themselves. Most serialisation formats are something like that.
 Think of it as a &quot;serialisation/deserialisation&quot; description AST.
 Indeed I would think if I had such a structure, I would think I&#x27;d be able to define &quot;ToJSON&quot;, &quot;FromJSON&quot; and &quot;ToSwagger&quot; instances from it, and perhaps others in the future. If I get them right once, then I can provide APIs/docs in different formats and know they&#x27;ll be in sync for all serialisation/deserialisation formats.
 Has this idea been attempted in a library? I don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel? Or is there no wheel and do people think it&#x27;s a wheel worth inventing (and why/why not?)

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to use the refinement library to restrict a year input to a specific set of values. For example, I want to only accept years like 1923, 1924, 1926, or 1930.
 Currently, I can achieve this using the Refined type as follows:
 type SomeYear &#x3D; Refined (Or (Or (EqualTo 1923) (EqualTo 1924)) (Or (EqualTo 1926) (EqualTo 1930))) Int 
 However, as you can see, this approach can get tedious and verbose when working with a larger set of allowed years. I was hoping to define a helper type that would allow me to specify a type-level list of allowed years, like so:
 type SomeYear &#x3D; OneOf &#x27;[1923, 1933, 1926, 1930, ...] 
 But I&#x27;m stuck on how to implement the OneOf type. Can anyone offer guidance on how to do this?

                              <span>Hi, I wanted to know if some had a tip to easily install GHCup without user inputs. The reason I’m asking is because I use ansible to set up my dev environments. I could look inside the the script and manually call the right things but it wouldn’t be easy to maintain if for some reason they change the way things are being installed.

                              <span>I am working on setting up org-jira in doom emacs and running into an authentication issue. 
 I set this variable:
  (setq jiralib-url &quot;https://.atlassian.net&quot;) 
 and then I put my settings into ~/.authinfo according to the documentation but when i try to fetch issues, I get the following error:
  The macOS Keychain auth-source backend doesn’t support creation yet 
 I have also tried several of the other hints in the documentation but ran into other authentication issues.
 Has anyone connected via MacOS?
 Thanks!

 Overall, my goals are to:
  
Keep track of all the tasks I have to do in a given day. Some of these would be routine that I do every day, while others may be related to projects or action items from meetings.
 Be able to track the amount of time I spend working on each task and overall in a day. Right now I&#x27;m using org&#x27;s clocking function and this is working pretty well (most of the time).
 Be able to view any relations between projects. These may be dependencies or common items such as a particular framework or process.
 Ability to export the data for reporting purposes.
  
To this end, so far I&#x27;ve been using a combination of org-agenda (t…</span>

                              <span>I am looking for guidance to point me in the right direction.
 I would like to develop an input that guides me though some inputs and results in a paragraph I can copy and paste into another program.
 For example, if I am writing about a patient with right shoulder pain:
  
Patient complains of [select Right or Left] [select body part from a list] pain starting [select timeframe from list]....
  
Each select section could be keyboard or mouse driven (whatever is easier for me to setup)
 I am wondering if I would need to write just a few lisp functions with a reference doc for them to pull from, if this would be an entire mode, or even can I use Emacs native dialog box for this?
 What wisdom do you emacs wizards have?

                              <span>I just upgraded gnupg to 2.4.1 via homebrew (on osx) and started freezing my emacs whenever I was saving encrypted files or needing to decrypt things. 
 At first I thought it was an emacs upgrade issue 29.0.60 and deprecated to 28.x but noticed I stlll had the problem in the 28 branch or even upgrading to 29.0.90. 
 I downgraded my homebrew version of gnupg to 2.4.0 which has fixed the problem but wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced the issue (or leave some google juice here for other people who might be scratching their head over the problem.
 I should mention I am on OSX Ventura and an M1 chipped macbook air, but curious if other people have run into this. (note: this is happening in org-mode with the standard org-crypt config and especially an ecnrypted org-journal.). 
 More to the point, does anyone know what may be causing this? At some point, I&#x27;d like to upgrade back up to 2.4.1. &#x3D;] 
 thanks!

 If I use alpha, the appearance is correct for the org-fragments. Any help is appreciated.
 This is how the preview looks

                              <span>Skyscope is a new tool from the Scalable Build Systems
team at Tweag. You can use it to visualise and explore Bazel
build graphs in your web browser. More specifically, it lets you import a
snapshot of a Skyframe graph (which might contain hundreds of thousands of
nodes) and then focus on a particular area of interest. For example, this image
was produced by running Skyscope on its own build graph:

  
  
    


Motivation
The Bazel documentation gives a good overview of Skyframe
that is worth reading if you’re interested, so we won’t go into the details
here. Essentially though, Skyframe is the underlying model that Bazel uses to
determine what actions it needs to perform when you run a command. The main
Skyframe data structure is a dependency graph where the nodes are entities like

                              <span>I have a command that invokes
 (call-process &quot;gnome-terminal&quot; nil 0) 
 and the recent update to Gnome 44 broke it. But not always:
  
If I launch emacs from a terminal (Gnome Terminal) and use my command or evaluate the form above, it works all right.
 If I do nohup emacs &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; so I can close the terminal from which I started Emacs, the command works until I close that terminal. After I close it, the command or the form do nothing.
 The normal way to use it for me is from an Emacs session started by a desktop file (I believe, because all this stuff is GUIed away. And also the real normal way for me would be to open a frame connected to a server session, but that&#x27;s now utterly broken and matter for another post). When evaluated in such an instance, the terminal that opens is not very collaborative and says
  
 bash: Error in ~/.profile.mine: directory ~/src/scripts/by_others not found.: No such file or directory bash: /usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux:[more paths…]: No such file or directory bash: readlink: command not found... Packages providing this file are: &#x27;coreutils&#x27; &#x27;coreutils-single&#x27; bash: basename: command not found... Packages providing this file are: &#x27;coreutils&#x27; &#x27;coreutils-single&#x27; Install package &#x27;ncurses&#x27; to provide command &#x27;tput&#x27;? [N/y] 
 Using my ignorance I guessed that the terminal that Emacs launches is somehow tied to the terminal that launched Emacs and that I don&#x27;t know how to fix it.
 I know that I should report this to Gnome developers but you know that would be a waste of time.
 I&#x27;m on Emacs 30.0.50 (pure GTK build, in case it matters) and it was the same in v. 28.2.

                              <span>Ten years ago, this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8SkdfdXWYaI attracted my attention to a way to use Emacs for coding, using voice commands. The audio software there, dragonfly, is proprietary. Seeing the recent resurgence in audio-to-text software, some of it free, like OpenAI Whisper, does anybody knows of a modern, free software, audio coding setup for Emacs?

                              <span>I know about enlarge-window-horizontally, but I&#x27;d like to have something slightly different: I want a function that enlarges the current window to the right, and a different function to enlarge it to the left. Of course, if it&#x27;s the leftmost window, enlarging to the left should do nothing. 
 I&#x27;d also need functions for enlarging on the up/down axis.
 Is that already in emacs and I missed it? If not, does anyone have a function for this?

 [Gentoo Linux Host] –ssh–&gt; [WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Windows VM)] –open–&gt; [emacs] –edit–&gt; /mnt/c//
 There is a significant performance increase to using the windows git.exe instead of the one on Ubuntu in wsl as I am working primarily in /mnt/c//
 I setup magit-git-executable to use windows git.exe as follows:
 elisp (when (string-match &quot;-[Mm]icrosoft&quot; operating-system-release) (setq magit-git-executable &quot;/mnt/c/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe&quot;)) 
 It works great; however, the only thing I cannot seem to get working is magit-commit
 I did manage to get it working without emacs however.
 I created a script in wsl to convert the git.exe path argument to a wsl path

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to be able to hit the left or right key to be able to change project roots. I tried binding my left and right keys to treemacs-root-down and treemacs-root-up in my use package declaration without any success. Does anyone know how to accomplish what I am trying to do?

 https://www.youtube.com/live/d18Fdu6ayM8?feature&#x3D;share
 In this episode, we will discuss the QuantifiedConstraints language extension.
 For this episode we will assume familiarity with type classes. An understanding of type families will be helpful for a part of the episode, but is not a requirement.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. The playlist containing the first episode is here:
 https://youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes:
 https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule:

This latest release has some awesome new features, including the ability for where clauses for property tests to have generated arguments in scope, skipping the discovery of invalid module names (like those pesky #Foo#.hs files emacs writes), and the ability to import configuration from separate files.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to use org mode (with either denote/org-roam/...) as a sort of database where I can store bookmarks for things that I want to &quot;read later&quot;, cook recipes, cool websites . 
 I could capture everything into a single inbox, then sort everything at the end of the day. It could be feasible.
 What I&#x27;d like to know is what&#x27;s a good way to categorize stuff:
  
1 category &#x3D; 1 file (everything about cooking is in cooking.org)
 
1 category &#x3D; 1 directory (everything about cooking is in the same directory. 1 bookmark &#x3D; 1 file)
 
1 category &#x3D; 1 tag (bookmarks are in different files - for example journals - and i can retrieve them with org-ql)
 
 I know it&#x27;s subjective, but I&#x27;d like to know your experiences in this regard.

The benefits of your Zettelkasten highly depend on the longevity of each note. Since the Zettelkasten as life-long companion and comrade in the battle for and against knowledge is a long-term endeavor, it is crucial that you create notes and structures that will last a long time. The minimum goal should be that they last a lifetime, so they are optimally designed for yourself. Ideally, they last forever, so future generations can benefit from your work as well.

                              <span>UPDATE: solved
 Thank you all, really. I&#x27;ve spent about 6 days to understand that
 I&#x27;ve just missed thing that outer fmap now takes function fmap (const &#x27;h&#x27;)
 LOL
 /thread
 Hi, I don&#x27;t understand how fmap . fmap evaluates, please help. I&#x27;ve spent already 6 days and I don&#x27;t get it still
 for example:(fmap . fmap) (const &#x27;h&#x27;) [Just &quot;huy&quot;,Nothing,Just &quot;huyhuy&quot;]
 I&#x27;ve understood how we get the final type
 Here it is:
 (.) :: ((g x -&gt; g y) -&gt; (f (g x) -&gt; f (g y))) -&gt; ((x -&gt; y) -&gt; (g x -&gt; g y)) -&gt; (x -&gt; y) -&gt; (f (g x) -&gt; f (g y)) fmap . fmap :: (x -&gt; y) -&gt; f (g x) -&gt; f (g y) (fmap . fmap) (const &#x27;h&#x27;) :: (b -&gt; Char) -&gt; f (g b) -&gt; f (g Char) (fmap . fmap) (const &#x27;h&#x27;) [Just &quot;huy&quot;,Nothing,Just &quot;huyhuy&quot;] -- -- :: List (Maybe String) -&gt; List (Maybe Char) 
 Here is a full signature
 (fmap . fmap) (const &#x27;h&#x27;) [Just &quot;huy&quot;,Nothing,Just &quot;huyhuy&quot;] -- :: ((Maybe String -&gt; Maybe Char) -&gt; (List (Maybe String) -&gt; List (Maybe Char))) -&gt; ((String -&gt; Char) -&gt; (Maybe String -&gt; Maybe Char)) -&gt; (String -&gt; Char) -&gt; (List (Maybe String) -&gt; List (Maybe Char)) 
 But not I&#x27;m trying to understand how it evaluates
 As I understood, composition will apply first and we get this:
 (.) fmap fmap &#x3D; \x -&gt; fmap (fmap x) 
 Then we apply const &#x27;h&#x27; like this
 fmap (fmap const &#x27;h&#x27;) fmap (fmap (const ‘h’)) [UPDATED] 
 And then we wait for our list, so inner fmap will evaluate first, right? Like this:
 fmap f lms case lms of [] -&gt; [] (x:xs) -&gt; const &#x27;h&#x27; Just &quot;huy&quot; : map f xs -- &#x27;p&#x27; (x:xs) -&gt; const &#x27;p&#x27; Nothing : map f xs -- &#x27;p&#x27; (x:xs) -&gt; const &#x27;p&#x27; Just &quot;woohoo&quot; : map f xs -- &#x27;p&#x27; [] -&gt; [] -- &#x27;p&#x27;:&#x27;p&#x27;:&#x27;p&#x27;:[] -- &quot;ppp&quot; 
 Am I right? If yes, then how the next fmap will evaluate?
 It doesn&#x27;t has function applied, just only &quot;ppp&quot;
 That&#x27;s absurd
 PLEASE, HELP, sorry for english if so

                              <span>I do see a lot of potential in the below tool that uses AI to generate a draft task list with the correct subtasks broken down. I think it would honestly be a great quality of life to be able to export an org markdown file directly from a tool like this, insert it into org mode and already have a lot of the boilerplate work done in structuring relatively common tasks/projects (I don&#x27;t imagine this tool would work well for more obscure tasks).
 https://goblin.tools/
 I sent some feedback to the dev of this to ask for org markdown export functionality but if they don&#x27;t do it someone else will eventually, the application of &quot;AI&quot; is just too sensible. When my ADHD is bad, just breaking down tasks into subtasks is exhausting, if an AI can do the stupid simple work (that isn&#x27;t demanding, complex mental work) of just getting most of my tasks written down than it is so much easier to start.

 For example, I have opened two windows. I want to incrementally search across both windows and get the ability to jump to text. 
 I have tried the evil-snipe package but as I understand it only works in one active window.
 I am using doom emacs with evil-mode (don&#x27;t know if it matters)

                              <span>I use Emacs (Evil) with eyebrowse and desktop.el for a persistent session. I would like to have multiple persistent sessions, each with its own eyebrowse workspaces and ideally its own set of persistent open buffers. Each session would be its own project with persistent window layouts.
 Is there a package that supports this? Not sure if desktop.el is conducive to multiple sessions. For a single session, last I checked, having more than one instance of Emacs when using desktop.el may cause some undesirable behavior when it comes to closing instances and saving them, at least with typical settings.
  
EDIT: C-x t 2 does not preserve eyebrowse workspaces, e.g. If there&#x27;s 3 workspaces in one Emacs tab, closing one of the eyebrowse workspaces also closes it on the rest of the tabs.

 I&#x27;m using doom emacs. Is there some really basic setting that I am just missing? To enable history when scrolling etc?

 Handy little feature i discovered yesterday when browsing the built in modes. Hope somebody finds it useful :)

 Recently, treemacs started to show wrong directory icon when I open treemacs in a new directory. It updates the icon to directory icon only after I expand the node.
 e.g.
 before (with wrong icon in elpa node)

 Any idea what could be the reason?

                              <span>If you have more than one Zettlekasten to manage, you may find org-roam to be a bit clunky when dealing with them. The proposed solution in the manual is to have an elist file that locally modifies the org-roam-directory and org-roam-db-location variables. I didn&#x27;t really like this approach, so I made something better, a very simple function that between a given list of Zettlekasten:
 (setq zettlekasten-paths-alist &#x27;((&quot;Main&quot; . &quot;~/Some/Path/&quot;) (&quot;Zettlekasten2&quot; . &quot;~/Other/Path/&quot;))) (defun switch-zettlekasten () (interactive) (let* ((keys (mapcar #&#x27;car zettlekasten-paths-alist)) (prompt (format &quot;Select Zettlekasten:&quot;)) (key (completing-read prompt keys)) (chosen-zettlekasten-path (cdr (assoc key zettlekasten-paths-alist)))) (setq org-roam-directory chosen-zettlekasten-path) (setq org-roam-db-location (concat chosen-zettlekasten-path &quot;org-roam.db&quot;)) (org-roam-db-sync))) 
 I have personally bound this to C-c n s since C-c n is the prefix for org-roam related commands. The s stands for switch. You may use anything else of course. Hope you find it useful.
 EDIT: Oops, I made a mistake when first posting this. Make sure the paths in the alist end with a forward slash, otherwise when concatenating to create the database file path you&#x27;ll end up with ~/Some/Pathorg-roam.db.

                              <span>I am fairly new to elisp, having started on vanilla emacs last month. I hacked together some code to read  key bindings from an org table. It is specific to evil mode and has lots of scope for improvement. Here it is: https://github.com/sooriravindra/DotFiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.rsoori/bindings.org
 In my init.el (in the same repo) I check if bindings.el exists. If it doesn&#x27;t I execute the source block in bindings.org which reads the org table and generates bindings.el
 Please let me know if you have ideas to improve or critique my rather hacky snippet.

 I&#x27;m looking to remove candidates from completion if they&#x27;re present in the user&#x27;s current selection.
 I&#x27;m personally using Vertico, but I would appreciate any core emacs config for this, if it exists. I&#x27;m not hopeful after my read of completing-read-multiple – which does not appear to ever modify TABLE.

                              <span>to make it short I&#x27;m trying to make an abstraction for slick table manipulation to be as general as possible for any table in a given database, after a long time the code below is prototype that is as far as I have been able to make it, and it works (I&#x27;ve made basic CRUD using it)but I think it can be more abstract especially the &#x27;baseTbl&#x27; but the compiler is having trouble inferring the types properly if I make it any more abstract, can any one help?
 ps: the (_Propety) is used because the code is supposed to run in a scalafx GUI and they are needed by scalafx objects
 ps2: also the reason for 2 classes (one generic and the second for Int) is because most tables have a simple id column that is integer with autoincrement but may not always be the case

                              <span>I am still relatively new to Scala, and when I read stuff online about Scala there seems to be a schism between people who think the JVM is an exciting selling point and those who think the JVM is a necessary evil to get the language working. I don’t have much experience with the JVM or non-Scala JVM languages, and I only notice the JVM in error logs, so I don’t know why so many people are passionately for or against the JVM. Is there something I am missing about it?

                              <span>I would like to be able to define custom constraint error messages that show the location of the calling context where the constraint error originated from, without template haskell, instead of where the error is defined. Is there a type that assumes the calling context? Or, is there a way to pass the calling context to a type function?
 Example
 1 type MyError (a :: Symbol) &#x3D; TypeError (Text a) 2 3 abc :: MyError &quot;ABC&quot; &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b 
 I would like line 3 to be in the error not line 1.
 Unsatisfiable may be an option but it is not implemented yet.

                              <span>Currently, when you compile distributed-process, you get a bunch of warnings like &quot;The constraint &#x27;Serializable a&#x27; matches instance (Binary a, Serializable a). This makes type inference for inner bindings fragile...&quot; In my own code, I have fixed similar warnings by switching from a class &quot;newtype&quot; to a type synonym. In this case, that would mean changing
 class (Binary a, Typeable a) &#x3D;&gt; Serializable a instance (Binary a, Typeable a) &#x3D;&gt; Serializable a 
 to
 type Serializable a &#x3D; (Binary a, Typeable a) 
 My question is: suppose I made this change in distributed-process. How might it affect users of the library? I have checked that it has no effect on my own code that uses distributed-process. But I don&#x27;t know enough to say what the impact might be in general.

                              <span>I want a custom prelude for my project that&#x27;s additive; it&#x27;ll have all the base prelude functions, but also automatically import Text, ByteString etc.
 I&#x27;ve created a Prelude.hs:
 {-# LANGUAGE PackageImports #-} module Prelude ( module P , module T ) where import &quot;base&quot; Prelude as P import Data.Text as T -- import Data.Text qualified as T 
 The end result is that I want to be able to use Data.Text qualified like T.Text or T.take in my code. If I import Data.Text unqualified, then GHC complains of conflicts between T and P; if I import it qualified, nothing gets reexported; I can&#x27;t use T.fun in my code. Is there any simple solution to this I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been configuring a custom agenda view for use with org-super-agenda similar to the very last example in the examples page. I also use org-modern.
 The custom agenda view works fine, however the org-modern faces for the TODO keywords are not applied in the custom agenda view. Even more strange is that the org-modern faces for priority levels do appear in the custom agenda view. I&#x27;ve tried both hooking org-modern-agenda to org-agenda-finalize-hook and using global-org-modern-mode with no success. I&#x27;m just not sure where this issue can be pinned down.

                              <span>The post turned out to be way longer than I expected because of some fond memories nobody cares about, but which I cannot remove now. Added a TL;DR at the end.
 I started writing Scala more than 9 years ago and got comfortable with &quot;Is Scala dying?&quot; kind of posts/threads every 3-4 months or so. Most of the time they come from people starting to learn the language or deciding whether they should invest their time into it (tl;dr they probably should), sometimes from someone desperate who decided to move on to Rust another language. It&#x27;s that time of the year again and this time I decided to chime in.
 My first real-world Scala project was such a bright mix of... things. Scalaz, Akka, Json4s and many small libraries I cannot even remember right now. Java reflection is all over the place, funn…</span>

 This milestone is mainly about incorporating the breaking changes from the &#x60;dottyquery&#x60; branch (originally by Stefan). That is, features that were dropped or changed in order to support Scala 3 have now been cleaned up and merged. (And &#x60;nafg/dottyquery&#x60; is rebased on &#x60;main&#x60;.)
 What&#x27;s left on &#x60;nafg/dottyquery&#x60; is mainly just actually making the code cross-build for Scala 3. It still needs a lot of cleanup, but that&#x27;s hopefully about it.
 Please try it out and let me know if you have any issues.
 And if you need anything that was dropped, let me know -- especially if you&#x27;re willing to contribute a Scala 3 implementation!

                              <span>Hi all,
 One of my new year&#x27;s resolution is to get better at emacs lisp, and it seems to me the best way to go about it is to build stuff that I&#x27;d find handy. I make heavy use of Zotero to store pdfs and now to annotate them via their pdf-annotator tool, but I was missing some sort of integration with org-roam that would allow me to automagically import the Zotero pdf annotations on the org-roam note for a specific reference. So I wrote some code to achieve this, see https://www.riccardopinosio.com/blog/posts/zotero_notes_article.html. Perhaps some of you will find the idea useful!

                              <span>Over the past few years I&#x27;ve accumulated a number of notes written in org-mode. I like organising my notes linearly (like a blog), using tags to loosely categorize them. I thought it would make a nice project to build a little web-based renderer for my notes; presenting each note file in a chronological index, where the index can be filtered by date and by tags, and each note entry can be maximised or minimised within the index, or opened in a new page.
 I&#x27;ve kept it very simple, using vanilla JS for the frontend and vanilla PHP on the server. I&#x27;ve uploaded the project to github, where you can find all the sources, some example note entries, a docker file for the server and setup / workflow instructions.

                              <span>I understand that the current emacs has the following flow of code transformation for our elisp codes to take effect:
 elisp -&gt; bytecode -&gt; LAP -&gt; native 
 Note that only with gccemacs does the elisp code makes to the final native phase. Otherwise, if I understand correctly, it gets turned into LAP [1] and controls the emacs event loop (in C) directly. In other words, in this case elisp gets compiled into LAP, and LAP gets interpreted directly.
 Q1. The source code of the bytecode interpreter is under /emacs/src/bytecode.c. How about the source code of the interpreter for elisp and LAP?
 Q2. Are there any known semantic differences among interpreted elisp, interpreted bytecode, interpreted LAP, and native code?
 Q3. What&#x27;s the current development of JIT compiler for elisp-&gt;LAP and for LAP-&gt;native? If the JIT compilation flow for elisp-&gt;native is finished, will bytecode and LAP be abandoned? If so, when will that happen?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to refactor code for org-colview.el.
 My first steps are always to separate code, divide it on pure &amp; impure functions.
 Pure:
  
It always returns the same result if given the same arguments.
 It can’t cause any side effects.
  
I was thinking that It would be great to mark somehow pure functions.
 I have found that it can be mark like this &#x27;(declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t)&#x27;.
 But I don&#x27;t see many functions in emacs codebase mark in this way.
 Why it&#x27;s not so popular?
 Is based on example below this is the correct way to mark functions?
 (defvar bar 10) ;;; before (defun add-one-to-bar () (setq bar (+ bar 1))) (add-one-to-bar) ;;; after (defun add-one (var) (declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t)) (+ var 1)) (setq bar (add-one bar))

 The problem with this keybindings is that it doesn&#x27;t work in a terminal. I most use my Emacs in terminal (Windows-dos-box, SSH, tmux, ... in different combinations).
 What whould be a good alternative key-binding here still involving the arrow keys?
 I do use evil-mode and org-mode most of the time.

 Why is this the case? I thought that by having no graphical interface the difference would be greater than 1 MB. 
 I have no experience in developing GUI applications, but this striked me as a surprise.

 Sometimes I have paragraphs (from opening files or inserting via copy and paste) that have much longer lines then then allowed column size (79 chars). Sometimes this also happens when I re-write an existing paragraph. I delete some words or insert some more words. The result looks ugly.
 I would like to mark the whole paragraph, execute a magic key-shortcut and all lines get re-wrapped.

                              <span>I&#x27;m planning to start blogging. It seems the following two options are best for my use case:
  
org-publish: systemscrafters YT, it&#x27;s show note
 ox-hugo documentation site
  
 My use case of blog: 
  
Planning to writing multiple documentations of small projects I work on
 Tutorials of the projects, Tips &amp; Tricks
  
 My Concerns:
  
I&#x27;d prefer minimal, (org-publish seemed bit more minimal, but not 100% sure)
 
I want to use separate org-files (on ox-hugo prefers single file for all site)
 I know nothing about HTML/CSS. (I&#x27;ll face some problems on theme-ing org-publish)
 I&#x27;ve heard about hugo is fast at parsing when there are many files. Would org-publish lag when there is hundreds of files?
 (not necessarily) I&#x27;d like to integrate org-roam&#x27;s back-linking, if it&#x27;s possible
  
What are your opinion and experience?

 https://github.com/Hugo-Heagren/svg-battery-indicator
 The package integrates with battery.el for percentage and charging status, and makes it easy to display the icon in the mode-line or tab-bar.

                              <span>I just grabbed the NOV package from MELPA, and an EPUB-format copy of Moby Dick from Gutenberg.
 Nov mode works fine with the EPUB document, and the major mode is named &quot;EPUB&quot;. Org-noter doesn&#x27;t start up, probably because it&#x27;s looking for a buffer in &#x60;nov-mode&#x60;. 
  
Does anyone use these packages together?
 
When did NOV change its major mode from &#x60;nov-mode&#x60; to &#x60;EPUB-mode&#x60;?
  
I am one of the maintainers for org-noter, but I only use it with PDFs.

                              <span>Link buttons in EWW for example are implemented as text-property buttons with a &#x27;follow-link&#x27; property and a &#x27;help-echo&#x27; property that encodes the URL to follow. (button-at (point)) when on such a button, returns a marker as the button object; let&#x27;s call it &#x27;linkbut&#x27;. But (button-activate linkbut) fails due to the lack of an &#x27;action&#x27; property. If this is considered a button as determined by button-at, then I would suggest that button-activate be updated to utilizes the follow-link property and activate the link appropriately.
 One simple way to resolve this is to start adding an &#x27;action&#x27; property to follow-link buttons.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to mark all long words (say: &gt; 20 chars) in the current buffer.
 My Google-fu didn&#x27;t help me much. Is there already something for this out there? If not, how could one build a elips script for selecting the words and marking those?

 Why is this happening?
 Is there any way show the options right away?
 OS: Arch Linux
 Emacs version: 28.1
 I have the same issue in emacs -Q, although the completion works differently in vanilla Emacs. I am using the consult/vertico/orderless framework.
 Here is the test code that you can run in your emacs config or in emacs -Q. In my case the result is the same. The new frame does not show options right away. I have to insert a character or press tab to see them.
 (defun test-miniframe-completing-read () &quot;Test miniframe completing read&quot; (interactive) (with-selected-frame (make-frame &#x27;((name . &quot;emacs-miniframe&quot;) (minibuffer . only) (width . 120) (height . 33))) (unwind-protect (let ((choices &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;second&quot; &quot;third&quot;))) (completing-read &quot;Select: &quot; choices)) (delete-frame)))) (test-miniframe-completing-read)

                              <span>Hi everyone, I had some enquiries about b2b scala job offers. What I understand is the developer should own his own company so that the contracts is between the two businesses ie the client and the developer. And in some cases there&#x27;s a talent recruitment firm in the middle. 
 My question is does the job application process differ from normal employment job offers. 
 Does the job application require you to apply as a business or individual say my company is scalaconsults. 
 What if you are a 3 man outfit. All partners in your business, can you still apply for such job contracts. How does the interview process go now that you are more than one.
 Incase of b2b scala jobs on linkedin where do I show that this is my business, this is my crew, this is what I&#x27;ve done. Coz on linkedin it seems like an individual process not business.
 Once your employed can you subcontract the work.
 Sorry for the many questions. Hope there&#x27;s a kind soul here who can clarify this whole b2b thing for me.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I want to explore the Erlang style concurrency model library in Haskell which is the cloud haskell project. My first step is to use it in a toy project to send ping-pong messages between two processes.
 I add distributed-process as a dependency and in extra-deps in stack.yaml file, but I get dependency errors. After adding the recommended dependencies, I am finally stuck with incompatible versions of base. The one in the stack lts version and the one in the library hashable do not match.
 I see that there&#x27;s a config setup for lts-19.28 here, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me when I create a new stack project with 19.28 resolver.
 Is there any other way I can get this to work? I am using GHCup for managing my Haskell installation and these are the versions if it matters.
 GHCup 0.1.19.2
 Stack 2.9.3

                              <span>Hello,
 if I understand correctly, then the lambda calculus consists of just variables, function application and abstraction.
 Given the term &quot;λa. (λ b. a b) a&quot; can you help me to understand what exactly the amounf of subexpressions of this lambda expression are?
 The lack or use of parentheses both still confuse me. I have read that sometimes most parentheses are ommitted and that the abstraction chooses its body greedily, that is, extends itself as far right as possible. My idea is:
  
The expression itself is a (not proper) subexpression
 The first lambda body extends over all the remaining symbols (?) meaning that we have an abstraction of the form λa. M where M a subexpression.
 M itself is an application again (λ b. a b) a
 a is a subexpression of M
 (λ b. a b) is another one
 Lastly, this is λ b. M&#x27; for some M&#x27; which in this case is a b. Now is a b an application? It has to be since the language doesn&#x27;t contain something like Var Var, but it does contain the application (X Y) for some terms of the language, right?
  
​
 It&#x27;s still a little confusing for me, could someone maybe point me to the right solution? I am sure if I understand this example I should be able to understand most of them. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I just figured out how to encode pattern matching into &quot;De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype&quot;:
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} module NestedPattern where import Control.Monad import Data.Functor.Compose import Data.Traversable import Data.Void data Term x where Var :: x -&gt; Term x App :: Term x -&gt; Term x -&gt; Term x Lam :: Traversable f &#x3D;&gt; Pattern f -&gt; Term (f x) -&gt; Term x data Pattern f where Bind :: Pattern Maybe Pair :: Pattern f -&gt; Pattern g -&gt; Pattern (Compose f g) instance Functor Term where fmap &#x3D; liftM instance Applicative Term where pure &#x3D; return () &#x3D; ap instance Monad Term where return &#x3D; Var Var x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; f x App e1 e2 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; App (e1 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f) (e2 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f) Lam pm e &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; Lam pm (e &gt;&gt;&#x3D; traverse f) instance Foldable Term where foldMap &#x3D; foldMapDefault instance Traversable Term where traverse f (Var x) &#x3D; Var  f x traverse f (App e1 e2) &#x3D; App  traverse f e1  traverse f e2 traverse f (Lam pm e) &#x3D; Lam pm  (traverse (traverse f) e) left, right :: Term Void left &#x3D; Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Just $ Nothing) right &#x3D; Lam (Pair Bind Bind) (Var $ Compose $ Nothing) 
 For those unaware, De Bruijn Notation as a Nested Datatype shows to use nested data types to encode debrujin indexes in the type system. In the encoding, an abstract syntax tree is parameterized by their free variables. Lambdas in this encoding simply add an extra inhabitant to their child term.
 My extension here uses GADTs (and HKTs) to make this work with patterns as well. A pattern in this encoding is something that describes how to map free variables, so Bind just adds an extra inhabit like what a normal lambda would do and Pair composes the maps of other patterns.

 I used to use just the following for my auto-revert-mode config:
 (global-auto-revert-mode 1) 
 but I noticed it wasn’t consistent in catching changes. So I did some research and found some suggested changes here and here that I tried in my config:
 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(auto-revert-remote-files t) &#x27;(auto-revert-interval 10) &#x27;(auto-revert-verbose nil) 
 This seemed to work more consistently, but I still notice inconsistency in files getting auto-reverted. 
 The one change I haven’t tried is setting auto-revert-use-notify to nil, but I was wondering if I’m missing something obvious in my setup. 
 Thanks for any help!

 Note that when I describe key, bindings like C-M-Spc don&#x27;t seem to be bound to other custom functions upon enabling treesitter, so I am not sure what&#x27;s changing their behavior.

 Edit: I should clarify that I want to complete language symbols and project-specific module/function names. I do not need shell command completion - that is a solved problem.

 I am trying to forget about standard terminal emulators, and to work 100% in emacs.
 how shall I open files when I am working in vterm. In my regular terminal emulator (alacritty), I would edit the files with emacsclient. but how when I am already in vterm in emacs?
 How you people do in that case? Open another emacsclient instance from within vterm?
 Thanks for sharing

                              <span>TITLE FIX: In elisp, how do I use consult to get the user&#x27;s selection from a list of items?
 Suppose I have the following list:
 (setq elements &#x27;((&quot;apple&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;) (&quot;train&quot; &quot;vehicle&quot;) (&quot;cherry&quot; &quot;fruit&quot;) (&quot;bycicle&quot; &quot;vehicle&quot;))) 
 How do I use consult and all the completion goodies to get one of the entries of the elements list?
 I would like to be able to select based on the name of the entry, which would be the first element of the list. But I would like to get the list as the selection.
 Is it possible?
 Is there a better way to structure the entries of the elements list? Maybe something like this:
 (:type &quot;vehicle&quot; :name &quot;train&quot;) 
 Sorry if this should be obvious, I am still learning elisp and I am struggling with it. I tried to read the code of the consult-buffer but I could not figure how is the plist SOURCE structured.
 SOLVED: completing-read function is the answer. There is a very nice guide here: https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/alt-completing-read.html

                              <span>I use Doom which packages better-jumper and binds better-jumper-jump-backward to C-o. I use this binding extensively in my workflow and it mostly works well, but there are a few scenarios where jumping backwards doesn&#x27;t seem to work.
 First, when I&#x27;m in Org Agenda and press Enter on a todo item (org-agenda-switch-to) to go to the corresponding org file, I&#x27;m unable to jump back to the Org Agenda buffer - C-o takes me to a seemingly random location. I tried fixing this with advice:
  (advice-add &#x27;org-agenda-switch-to :before #&#x27;better-jumper-set-jump) 
 but the location in Org Agenda still doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the jump list.
 Second, when in helpful mode (when looking up docs with e.g. helpful-key or helpful-callable) I can&#x27;t figure out how to go back after following a link in the docs (i.e. after pressing Enter over a link). In helpful mode better-jumper-jump-backward just doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything and I&#x27;m at a loss as to how I&#x27;m supposed to navigate.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate any help from those more familiar with setting up these libraries than I am.

 I am writing a paper, and I need to use a specific CLS file. I don&#x27;t want to add it to my init.el in the list org-latex-classes, is it possible to using .dir-locals.el for this? Couls you show me an example?
 Thanks in advance
 Update: confused CLS with CSL

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;ve been recently spending a lot of time inside docker containers (or Podman in my case), and because of this, project.el has picked up a project and stored it in the projects file. If Emacs reboots and the container is no longer there, project attempts to open the file in TRAMP, and TRAMP hangs until I press q to allow tramp to exit.
 I can think of two ways to hypothetically fix this:
 The first is by modifying the project-find-functions list. It&#x27;s a list of functions which are ran in succession until one of them returns a truthy value. My current project-find-functions is (project-try-vc project-try-local). I believe in my case project-try-vc is returning t.
 The second is by telling TRAMP to move on after a failure, allowing the boot to complete even when some projects are not accessible. I&#x27;m thinking an advice might be necessary to achieve this.
 Are there any other options? Does anyone out there have a solution to this already?
 Thanks!

 Hardware and OS
 CPU : Ryzen 5800X OS: Windows 11 Pro 10.0.22621
 Mostly CPU is the only relevant hardware here.
 Emacs environment
 Custom-built binary: Emacs master branch, commit a57a8b. I built using the configure flags in this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/131354i/guide_compile_your_own_emacs_to_make_it_really/
 Prebuilt binary: Download the official website, commit bc61a1: https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-30/
 I tried to build from source with the same commit, but it failed. Both differ not too much anyway.
 Both run the same .emacs.d and all built-in Elisp libraries are compiled to eln.
 Benchmarks

 Is there any easy way to keep projects and their subtasks grouped in the agenda view, even if the priority of them is different? I.e. this is how it is without priorities set https://imgur.com/1QML6US (I assume based on the order the files are processed) And this is what it looks like after changing the priorirty: https://imgur.com/Dfven4b
 And this is what I would like for it to look like: https://imgur.com/NUwAy8K or https://imgur.com/lsire7C

                              <span>Hi,
 I have based my emacs config on Emacs Prelude from u/bbatsov, because I did not trust starting from vanilla emacs.
 When starting my emacs, I get a warning saying the the package dash-functional is no valid anylonger and must be replaced by the package dash from the same author,
 Is it some thing I can dom or only the author of Prelude?
 So far, I have installed dashm but it does not seem to fix the problem. Thx for your insights,

Which shortcut should I use? Or what are the general rules? C-c, C-x, C-i or something else?.
 
How to rebind it? I often struggle with that simple keybinding stuff because of different modes and keymaps. I didn&#x27;t get the concept of it and often fail of rebind keys.

                              <span>I use TRAMP a lot to access remote Linux machines (from a local macOS machine), usually without any problems. I try to do the same to access remote macOS machines, but I have never managed to get it to work.
 From within Emacs using vterm I can ssh into remote macOS machines just fine. But if I try to connect to the same machine using TRAMP to open the remote user&#x27;s home directory in Dired it always fails. Or, more correct, it takes ages to complete, never actually connecting.
 This is true for all remote macOS machines I have tried to connect to using TRAMP. None of them uses any fancy oh-my-zsh, the prompts are standard macOS zsh prompts.
 Is there anything specific with remote macOS that messes up TRAMP?

  (setq ns-function-modifier &#x27;hyper) 
 and it works perfectly fine on my GUI Emacs on MacOS, but it becomes a problem in terminal emacs, where it doesn&#x27;t recognize the key. I was wondering how to fix this, or what the best way is to have my own command prefix.

                              <span>I am tinkering with EXWM again and I would like to be able to access to the keybinding space activated by the &#x27;general prefix key&#x27;. I use Evil package and the prefix key is SPC when in normal mode. The problem is that this prefix is not available in Firefox and such because SPC gets intercepted.
 So, my question is, how do I add C-SPC as an additional prefix key so that both SPC and C-SPC act as viable ways to activate the which-key minibuffer? I would use SPC in Emacs buffers and C-SPC in xorg clients.
 Side question, related to EXWM: Does anybody know why the media keys do not work in full screen videos played in firefox? If the video is not in fullscreen the media keys work, which is really weird. First time I see something like this.

                              <span>Hi, I tried everything.
 I have org setted up with elpaca like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (use-package org :config (font-lock-add-keywords &#x27;org-mode &#x27;((&quot;^ *\([-]\) &quot; (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) &quot;•&quot;)))))) (electric-indent-local-mode -1) (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((clojure . t) (cpp . t) (elisp . t) (haskell . t) (python . t) (scheme . t) (shell . t) (C . t))) (require &#x27;ob-python) :hook ((org-mode . org-indent-mode) (org-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (org-mode . visual-line-mode)) :init (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/Notes&quot;) org-babel-default-header-args:python &#x27;((:results . &quot;output&quot;)) org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil org-edit-src-content-indentation 2 org-ellipsis &quot;  &quot; org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t org-hide-block-startup nil org-hide-emphasis-markers t org-image-actual-width nil org-pretty-entities t org-src-fontify-natively t org-src-preserve-indentation t))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I tried moving org-babel-do-load-languages to :init.
 I tried moving it at the end of my configuration after (elpaca-wait).
 I tried putting it inside (eval-after-load &#x27;org).
 If I go to an Org file (and I see that the configuration is getting loaded, because things like org-agenda-files appear), and I do C-c C-c on a Python source file, I receive the message No org-babel-execute function for python!.
 The only way it works is if I do ielm and either manually do the org-babel-do-load-languages thing, or I run (require &#x27;ob-python).
 It&#x27;s been all day and I can&#x27;t get it to work inside my configuration file.
 Can somebody help me please?

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I&#x27;m studying CS and currently attend a course that involves creating a small project using REScala to give a little introduction to functional-reactive programming (in addition to doing all the necessary research and writing a small paper about it).
 My professor added, that everything we intend to demonstrate during our presentation should not be something trivial like a &#x60;Hello, world!&#x60; programs or similar, so I figured I might ask here if anybody has some small project ideas that are feasible for a Scala and FRP newbie yet ideally impress my professor.
 Thanks in advance for any help! 
 EDIT:
 I might&#x27;ve added that I am not new to functional programming in general and definitely know my way around (have some experience using various languages, mainly Haskell).

                              <span>Hi Scala Peeps,
 I wrote a new blog about some of the not-so-obvious and common features of SBT, especially for the newbies. Here is the link: https://yadukrishnan.live/unlocking-the-power-of-sbt-a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-not-so-common-features
 With this, I am hoping that I can help some of the new comers to SBT to use these powerful features of SBT. 
 Please do read the blog and let me know if you find it useful and informative. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All, 
 Im a Univeristy Student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton, and as apart of my Dissertation / Thesis i have created a proof-of-concept tool that combines ideas from the Functional Language Haskell with the Block-Based visual paradigm.
 Ive spent alot of time and effort on this project, and whilst i havent managed to achieve all my goals, im still proud of its outcome and am here to share it!
 You can find the project at https://blockell.netlify.app/, where you can create small programs using blocks to declare functions and generate haskell code. Unfortionately, there are no tutorials for the tool, and to run the code you have to copy it into a haskell file and run it locally on your machine. :( 
 Anyways, if you like the tool, or have any comments, suggestions or improvements feel free to comment them below or answer this anonymous feedback form here: https://forms.office.com/e/nd6sJ3Gq0U 
 Any and all commments with be tremendous help to my project, but also Im just proud of this language and want others to see it :)

                              <span>This is a very technical note. A somewhat mathematical, even.
On a meta-level, it&#x27;s interesting to me because category theory is a field for which I have 0 (zero!) formal knowledge. I only know some practical applications from programming patterns. That makes writing a note among the lines of &quot;WTF is a functor&quot; a permanent work in progress:  I can only start with my superficial knowledge and expand on it.
That means I&#x27;ll be keeping one foot in the realm of the known (programming) and one in the unknown (category theory).
While the realm of the known expands with every article I read, I can make amends to this note. This, in turn, means that malleability of these notes pays off very quickly!
Feedback questions:
The title is just &quot;Functor&quot;.    Not sure what to change that to, if at all.

                              <span>OK, I never have completely left but I have been trying other options and let me tell you - it is not better on the other side!
 I tried Helix - too limited for now.
 Neovim - not wanting to do things on my own, I tried pre-built configurations and nothing worked, even after having to upgrade to a PPA to get an up to date version.
 Kate - still too limited but getting there.
 VSCode - ok, this is my fallback for when I need something now and Emacs is not there. It could be my main driver but I don&#x27;t like Microsoft &#x27;s approach to open source and the fact that keybinds are not the same in Linux, Windows and Mac!
 I am using Spacemacs and it mostly works, I just have to work on getting some layout and behaviour the way I like it!
 It looks like I am getting to the point where Emacs will finally become my main (if not only!) editor. Quite a change for someone who has tried many, many times!

                              <span>I&#x27;m on Windows 11. Emacs installed via Msys2. Everything was working fine for months until about 6 weeks ago. Now my emacs appears to hang when waiting for an external process to respond. I can most consistently repro with M-x package-refresh-contents. My emacs then hangs with the &quot;Importing package-keyring.gpg...&quot; message and never responds. Fortunately, C-g gets it to respond again. Here is my backtrace: 
 epg-wait-for-completion(...) epg--import-keys-1(...) epg-import-keys-from-file(...) package-import-keyring(&quot;c:/msys2/mingw64/share/emacs/28.2/etc/package-keyring.gpg&quot;) package-refresh-contents() 
 This is on my work PC and I thought for sure something must have changed in my environment that&#x27;s causing this (even though I haven&#x27;t changed anything in my emacs config). I&#x27;ve used emacs for years but I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to debugging it. After having no luck troubleshooting for hours, I decided to install Msys2 and emacs on my home PC to compare my work PC to a working emacs install. To my surprise, it is broken in the same way on my home PC even after being freshly installed with no custom configuration.
 Anyone have an idea on what the issue could be?

 Hi everyone,
 I am on Artix, with emacs29, I have installed &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;telega&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; in emacs.
 As explained in the manual, I have installed TDLib with pacman (the package is called telegram-tdlib).
 When starting telega, I get the following error message:
 telega-server-build: TDLib is not installed into &quot;/usr/local&quot;. Set ‘telega-server-libs-prefix’ to the TDLib installion path 
 ​
 Question: I am not sure what I must look for.
 I have listed the dependencies and files installed by the package

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to load tree sitter grammars for python in Emacs 29 (GNU Emacs 29.0.90 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.20, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2023-04-26; running as a snap package in Linux Mint)
 I&#x27;ve tried every recipe I can find online, and I seem to be able to download and build the grammar libraries, but my emacs denies the libraries exist.
 I tried
 (add-to-list &#x27;treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;(python &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/&quot;)))
 I then used M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and selected python.
 And then when I run python-ts-mode, I get:
 ⛔ Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language grammar for python is unavailable (not-found): (libtree-sitter-python libtree-sitter-python.0 libtree-sitter-python.0.0 libtree-sitter-python.so libtree-sitter-python.so.0 libtree-sitter-python.so.0.0) No such file or directory
 I can see the built library &quot;~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-python.so&quot;, but still Emacs can&#x27;t find it.

 I tried WSL2 and while it is fast, there are some problems:
  
WSL2 cannot not modify Windows NAS drives, even if you mount. A deal breaker for me.
 The Emacs GUI can&#x27;t be repositioned using Windows hotkeys like native windows.
  
I tried the pre-compiled Emacs on Windows, but it is slower than WSL2. Typing latency is not as good. Trying this sample benchmark, with pre-compiled Emacs, it took 6-7 seconds to finish. With my compiled Emacs, it took 2.6 seconds.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun fibonacci(n) (if (&lt;&#x3D; n 1) n (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))
 (setq native-comp-speed 3) (native-compile #&#x27;fibonacci) (let ((time (current-time))) (fibonacci 40) (message &quot;%.06f&quot; (float-time (time-since time))))

 In this thread, someone reported 11 second with native comp!

                              <span>I do not know if it makes sense. But I am not a programmer. I just write academic articles using markdown and latex. I tried different editors and really liked emacs. I just copied a few people&#x27;s setup files for my emacs, and I&#x27;ve already lost track of those pieces. 
 I would like to learn some basics in LISP so that I can not only understand some of those setups but also be able to create some quick modifications of my own. 
 Is this going to be a waste of time? Is there a quick guide for someone who has almost zero knowledge of programming? (A computer scientist told me LISP was actually hard to use nowadays, so I should not spend time on this. I should just keep using others&#x27; setups for my own purpose.)

                              <span>Has anyone figured out how to render HTML emails in notmuch using xwidget?
 Running xwidget-webkit-browse-url on the saved HTML file works, so it should be be possible. The problem with that is it opens in a dedicated buffer.
 Ideally Emacs would render the HTML with xwidget inside the text/html drawer of the notmuch-show-mode buffer.

 I am using emacs-29 (./configure --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid --with-imagemagick --with-x --with-mailutils) on artix.
 I use emacsclient -n -c -a &quot;&quot; to open a new frame.
 why are the separations of my windows so ugly? I get a wide grey divider, when using dirvish, it is even worse (2 separators!!!)
 How can I only get a line to separate these? or anything else prettier (examples with screenshots welcome!!!)

                              <span>I want to use a function to do the following and bind it to a key combo to call it conveniently when outlining in Org mode:
  
If point is on a heading that has a visible subtree, call org-cycle to fold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has a folded subtree, call org-cycle to unfold that subtree.
 If point is on a heading that has no children but is not a top-level item, call outline-up-heading to go to its parent heading, then call org-cycle to fold the subtree that contains the item at point.
  
This would provide an all-purpose &#x27;toggle-visiblity-at-point&#x27; command. Maybe outline-hide-subtree / outline-show-subtree / org-show-children would be more efficient in all or some of these cases than org-cycle?
 I could probably cobble something together myself, but having only the most rudimentary grasp of Elisp, it would take me a good deal of browsing forum posts about how to determine heading states / levels plus trial and error so I&#x27;m hoping someone here will bite and help me out.
 Many thanks!

 I have two files, file1 with day-to-day todos, and file2 with recurring annual todos. C-c a n only shows the todos from file1 in date order. The todos from file2 do show up, but as a list underneath the agenda view.
 How can I get the entries in file2 to show up under the correct dates along with the ones in file1?
 Hope that makes sense! Thanks.

 It works setting the same property in a headline property drawer but I&#x27;d prefer to set it at the file level to remove the property drawers and thus not repeat myself. This file only contains my habitual tasks. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 so I would like to know why as well as why the message supposedly makes sense.
 Here are two examples:
 hungry &#x3D; \ x -&gt; hungry weird x &#x3D; x x 
 I am going to focus on the &#x60;weird&#x60; function first because the type is a bit nicer.
 My GHC 9.4.2 produces this error:
 • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘t1’ with actual type ‘t1 -&gt; t2’ ‘t1’ is a rigid type variable bound by the inferred type of weird :: (t1 -&gt; t2) -&gt; t2 at hungry.hs:10:1-13 • In the first argument of ‘x’, namely ‘x’ In the expression: x x In an equation for ‘weird’: weird x &#x3D; x x • Relevant bindings include x :: t1 -&gt; t2 (bound at hungry.hs:10:7) weird :: (t1 -&gt; t2) -&gt; t2 (bound at hungry.hs:10:1) | 10 | weird x &#x3D; x x | ^ 
 Older versions used to talk about occurs check failing.

 I find the wording - &#x60;rigid type varia…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to setup a haskell.nix project, however I&#x27;m having trouble trying to add an external dependency.
 The project requires the z3 smt solver.
 I&#x27;ve tried adding z3 to the extra-libraries section in the cabal file as described here. And this adds the executable to the development shell correctly.
 However, when running the result of the build (from a shell other than the development shell) this dependency is not available, and I get an error thrown.
 Thanks for any help

 ZuriHac 2023 is getting closer and we&#x27;re excited to announce that we will offer a number of 20 minute lightning talk slots to those participating in-person:
 https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/#lightning-talks
 Traditionally we&#x27;ve only done invited talks but several people have expressed strong interest in this so we&#x27;re happy to try it out this year. We welcome submissions for this until the 12th of May.
 We&#x27;re also still looking for sponsors for this year&#x27;s ZuriHac! If you are working at a company that&#x27;s using Haskell, please check if they&#x27;re interested and get in touch with us -- ZuriHac is one of the best places to recruit Haskellers.
 For more information on the event see https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/. Hope to see some of you there!

 So I created a function that takes in a list of lists and returns the list with the shortest length.
 For example, 
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] &#x3D; Just [1]
 Problem is I need it to work for infinite lists too.
 For example,
 short [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2..], repeat 5, [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]] &#x3D; Just [1]
 How should I go about it?

 TL;DR: How does this code work? Specifically, the runRepl function. (And a follow-up question: is this normal, &quot;good&quot; code? Or to put it another way: is this intuitive to experienced Haskell folks?)
 -- This function.

I realized that he is using his own libs in project described in book. I&#x27;m just wondering if these libraries are actually popular and worth learning. Especialy as a first contact with basic things like managing files, sending requests, connecting with DBs etc.

Announcing ical: A pessimistic iCalendar (RFC 5545) library by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
RFC 5545 is a widely used specification for calendar data exchange on the internet. It defines a data format for representing calendar events, such as appointments, meetings, and reminders.
Drawing trees functionally: Reingold and Tilford, 1981 by William Yaoh
Functional programmers often work with trees; for explanatory or debugging purposes, it is useful to be able to visualize them. I explain one such algorithm for drawing m-ary trees, the Reingold-Tilford algorithm, which runs in O(n) time.

                              <span>In case some haven&#x27;t been watching, I&#x27;ll mention that Simon Winchester&#x27;s new book Knowing What We Know on knowledge to transmission was published by Harper on April 25th in North America. For zettelkasten fans, you&#x27;ll note that it has some familiar references and suggested readings including by our friends Markus Krajewski, Ann Blair, Iaian McGilchrist, Alex Wright, Anthony Grafton, Dennis Duncan, and Mortimer J. Adler to name but a few.
Many are certain to know his award winning 1998 book The Professor and the Madman which was also transformed into the eponymous 2019 film starring Sean Penn. Though he didn&#x27;t use the German word zettelkasten in the book, he tells the story of philologist James Murray&#x27;s late 1800s collaborative 6 million+ slip box collection of words and sentences which when edited into a text is better known today as the Oxford English Dictionary.
If you need some additional motivation to check out his book, I&#x27;ll use the fact that Winchester, as a writer, is one of the most talented non-linear storytellers I&#x27;ve ever come across, something which many who focus on zettelkasten output may have a keen interest in studying.</span>

                              <span>Computing is all about transforming data.
A wide variety of domains, such as multimedia, securities trading or compilers,
allow decomposing the corresponding transformations into a sequence of well-defined steps.
Moreover, these steps can be combined in different ways,
perhaps omitting some or changing the order of others,
producing different data processing pipelines tailored to a particular task at hand.
Consider your favorite compiler: it consists of a lexical and syntactical analyzer, a possible preprocessor,
some optimization passes (which can be turned on or off),
various optional static analysis features, a code generator, and so on.
Yet, some of these steps might depend on each other,
and some warnings might only make sense before certain other optimizations have happened.

                              <span>I recently needed to recreate a wsl and since I did it, it seems my emacs, using wslg does not find any remote binaries like before.
 Using nix and direnv in my repo it provides all require things like cargo or rls. 
 Running emacs -nw works but without it opening the ui in windows, even if I see direnv loaded … emacs does not found anymore rls or even cargo.
 I really do not get what I am missing here …

                              <span>I’m a long time vimmer and having sparsely used spacemacs in the past and later doom emacs, have set out to write my own vanilla config.
 I’m trying to define leader based keybindings similar to doom and spacemacs with SPC as the leader.
 It seems that general.el is the preferred package for this. But I found that evil mode also presents evil-set-leader and allows for configuring prefix based commands. Further we can customize text for which-key prefixes which changes +prefix to +custom_text for instance.
 I’m considering setting up the entire leader based keymap with evil’s existing support. Is there any shortcomings to this? What can general provide me with that I cannot get with evil’s leader support? 
 Appreciate any advice on this.

                              <span>Does anyone know of any ebook reader that allows for adding notes in books which would be usable with org-mode? The way I would image a PERFECT solution would be an open machine with Emacs, where e-books are opened via something like nov.el and notes are added as org-docs with reference to a book position. I don&#x27;t think anything allows for this (fingers crossed for Pine Note!).

                              <span>My workflow uses an e-ink tablet for reading (textbooks) and rough note taking (lectures, exercises). My rough notes sync from my e-ink device to my laptop, where I use Obsidian to transform my e-ink notes into more fleshed out notes (Evergreen notes).
 I like being outside and work/study from different places and one hurdle I run into is I don’t have a way of accessing my nice fleshed out Obsidian notes on my e-ink device. Usually I have to have my laptop/phone next to me and reference my notes from there, which is not ideal. 
 Now, this has me wondering if I can warrant myself switching to emacs and org to have my computer notes (org files) easily accessible on my e-ink device. 
 I have been doing a bit of searching and I guess org-publish and then accessing a website on my e-ink device could work. Perhaps mass exporting all my .org files as pdfs/epubs and then syncing them to my e-ink device. (I don’t know if that method could keep backlinks)
 But as I have never used org and this is just my speculation I came here to ask: Is this feasible? Do any of you have a similar setup? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently noticed a trend in my workplace where Scala is losing its footing in favour of alternative languages like Golang. Our latest projects no longer use Scala, and we&#x27;ve even gone so far as to refactor some complex legacy Scala code into more streamlined Golang. 
 As someone who loves Scala, it&#x27;s been a bit disheartening to see this shift in adoption. Has anyone else experienced a similar transition within their organizations? And for those who have, what do you think are the driving factors behind this change?

                              <span>Dupin is a minimal, idiomatic, customizable validation Scala library. https://github.com/yakivy/dupin
 Parser[F[_], E, A, B] - is a parser from type A to type B, represents a function A &#x3D;&gt; F[IorNec[E, B]], especially could be useful for fans of parse don&#x27;t validate style.
 Btw, I remember that several months ago somebody asked about validator type that can accumulate failures and proceed with validation, this is exactly what Parser.liftToTraverseCombiningP method does. I put more or less real complex validation scenario here: https://github.com/yakivy/dupin#complex-example.
