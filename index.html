                    <span>I&#x27;m struggling to understand the documentation on how font-lock works. I want to highlight &quot;todo&quot; lines and I have found that this works:
 (defun highlight-todo () (font-lock-add-keywords nil &#x27;((&quot;^;;+\s*?\\(TODO:.*$\\)&quot; 1 &#x27;font-lock-warning-face)))) (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;highlight-todo) 
 But this doesn&#x27;t:
 (font-lock-add-keywords &#x27;text-mode &#x27;((&quot;^;;+\s*?\\(TODO:.*$\\)&quot; 1 &#x27;font-lock-warning-face &#x27;prepend))) 
 I&#x27;d rather tie the keyword to the mode, what am I missing?
 Also, please ignore the fact that my regexp looks for lisp comments while in text-mode. :)

                    <span>Anyone know of an Emacs-based tool I could use or abuse be able to build custom view of emails based on query results? For instance, find all emails in a range from ticketing system, extract data from email bodies based on query syntax or even regex, then present a custom view of the results?
 I&#x27;ve not only not found anything like that for Emacs I&#x27;ve not found anything like that period.

                    <span>I&#x27;m wondering Should I use .emacs or init.el file if I Just want to maintain one file for everything?
 My Objective:
 I want to use the the ONE FILE to move around different computers or hosts and get all my same packages in other computer or hosts without doing much works.
 In other words, keep one file and have all the packages and setting in different environments, (Linuxs or macOS, not sure about windows)

 I&#x27;m using 
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t)
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;) t)
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) t)
 Is that the right one and all the right ones?

 kind regards

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to use map-elt to match an element in an alist in which the keys are strings, not symbols. Using srings is convenient here in part becasue I have to go back and forth with a JSON representation in other places, and also because I compare the keys to org-mode properties, which are strings themselves; and also I don&#x27;t think + is permitted in symbol names in lisp? Here&#x27;s the code:  (defvar org-lms-grading-table &#x27;((&quot;A+&quot; . 92) (&quot;A&quot; . 87) (&quot;A-&quot; . 83) (&quot;B+&quot; . 78) (&quot;B&quot; . 75) (&quot;B-&quot; . 72) (&quot;C+&quot; . 68) (&quot;C&quot; . 65) (&quot;C-&quot; . 62) (&quot;D+&quot; . 58) (&quot;D&quot; . 55) (&quot;D-&quot; . 52)) &quot;Quick lookup table for marks&quot;) (map-elt org-lms-grading-table &quot;A&quot; nil &#x27;equal)  I can make this work, but I have to used the deprecated TESTFN argument to map-elt (set here to equal). However, it&#x27;s pretty common to use string keys in alists (rather than symbols) and I guess I feel a bit ripped off by map-elt when it doesn&#x27;t let me do just that. I know I can use assoc or alist-get, but I prefer to use map-elt if it&#x27;s workable. 
 Does anyone know more about this? thanks!

                    <span>Following this post https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/13805, I&#x27;m trying to use raw elisp in :noweb-ref header arguments. However, I just can&#x27;t get it to work.
 Take for example this org file:
 #+begin_src nix :noweb yes :tangle yes some-variable &#x3D; &gt; #+end_src #+begin_src nix :tangle no :noweb-ref (if (equal system-name &quot;home&quot;) &quot;value&quot;) value-for-home-system #+end_src #+begin_src nix :noweb-ref :noweb-ref (if (equal system-name &quot;office&quot;) &quot;value&quot;) value-for-office-system #+end_src 
 What I&#x27;m expecting after tangling (in a system with a host name home) is:
 some-variable &#x3D; value-for-home-system 
 However, I get
 some-variable &#x3D; 
 This is wierd becase the elisp function works as expected if used in the :tangle argument (as in the stackexchange linked above), but not in the :noweb-ref argument. Its like the elisp function is never evaluated or can&#x27;t be used in the :noweb-ref argument.
 Is there a wat to get this to work as expected?

 Any tricks or advice?

                    <span>I have a lot of notes in my org directory. Some of the notes are about math, others about music, others are about metalearning, and others are just technical (mostly programming and frameworks).
 So there is a great variety in the notes. They are in separated files.
 The biggest notes are the math notes. I read books and then I take notes in org format with latex math notation. Math notes also have a lot of screenshots from the book.
 The structure of my org directory is flat. The only exception is the org/img directory where I store the screenshots. Every other note is in the org/ directory.
 I would like to start using org-agenda and todo and I was wondering if I should create a separate directory for agenda such as org/agenda and keep there my todo entries.
 What do you think of this approach?
 What is your approach on structuring the org directory?
 Do you keep everything flat or you have classified your files in org sub-directories?
 Do you use separate files for each note or you have all notes in one or two files?
 I am currently using deft. Do you think org-roam is better and why?

                    <span>I want to archive items into an archive location which maintains the subtree structure of the item, so I need the right syntax for expressing it in the #+ARCHIVE property
 eg. Say I have an Item at:
 * First Level ** Second Level *** Third Level TODO: Some Task 
 When archived to the * Archive subtree it should be at

                    <span>I am learning about the todo capabilities in emacs and it seems to me that there are two separate ways to manage the todo lists.
 Please correct me if I am wrong, because I did not manage to understand this clearly from the documentation.
 The way I understood it is that todo-mode is a separated module which manages all to todo entries in a single file.
 On the other hand, org-agenda integrates the todo entries inside any file in the org directory and then allows us to see a summary of all the todo entries.
 Is my understanding correct?
 Is todo-mode still relevant, given that org provides a much more integrated way to manage the todo tasks?

                    <span>My workflow would look something like this:
 Split screen
 In new buffer open org agenda view
 Move cursor to task in agenda window
 Hit return
 Other buffer should open file and position of selected task
 Is this behaviour possible?

                    <span>I love hippie-exp.el for enhanced abbrev completion in a buffer, and I want one of the &quot;try&quot; functions in hippie-expand-try-functions-list to be a custom one that tries to complete based on matching EXPANSIONS in my existing global-abbrev-table. This table is filled with hundreds of words for which I&#x27;ve defined abbreviations and associated expansions—so many that I can&#x27;t remember them all, hence this desired feature. hippie-exp.el does have the function try-expand-all-abbrevs, but this tries to expand based on typed text matching ABBREV strings in the global-abbrev-table, not the full EXPANSION strings as I desire.
 I know abbrev tables are obarrays and that try-expand-all-abbrevs works by calling abbrev-expansion to get the symbol value (i.e., the expansion) associated with the abbrev that the user typed in the buffer. How do I programatically try to match against the table&#x27;s EXPANSIONS values instead of its ABBREV symbols? Is it possible to quickly create a new abbrev table from the existing global one that swaps the global one&#x27;s symbols and values? Or is there another obvious function that a lisp noob like me hasn&#x27;t learned?
 Thank you so much!
 EDIT: I was assuming that keeping the obarray approach was better than moving all the expansions from the abbrev table into a list, because I’ve heard lists are slower to search against than obarrays. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

                    <span>I&#x27;m making a library for building simple interactive grid-based games, based on the universe from HTDP (Racket) and reactors (Pyret). The idea is simple; the user supplies the following:
  
 initialState :: S
  onKey :: Key -&gt; S -&gt; S
  onMouse :: Mouse -&gt; S -&gt; S
  onTick :: S -&gt; S
  draw :: S -&gt; Grid
  
The library then maintains a game loop, calls the respective event handling functions, and renders the current state. I&#x27;m wondering whether I should keep the event handling functions (most importantly onTick) pure, or if I should allow the users to execute some effects in them (by placing onTick into some kind of monad, probably IO). 
 I think an effect-less onTick will do most of the time, but I wouldn&#x27;t like to limit the users of my library (my students) too much. I wonder what the design best practices regarding this are.
 EDIT: So far the best option I could think of is to make my own monad — probably a derivative of state, given that the event handlers are basically just state functions — so that I will be able to add functionality to it should the need arise. I might start with support for RNG, but maybe the users will think of something else.

                    <span>Continuing my saga into ODBC:
 I finally got ODBC working with Oracle (without Haskell). I&#x27;m now trying to build a program with hdbc-odbc as its dependency, through stack. Since the package doesn&#x27;t seem to be in stackage, I added the dependency to stack.yaml as:
 extra-deps: - HDBC-odbc-2.6.0.0 
 Then I added the import into the Lib.hs:
 import Database.HDBC.ODBC 
 Then, when I run stack build, it&#x27;s as if the hdbc-odbc isn&#x27;t being considered in the build at all:
  Could not find module ‘Database.HDBC.ODBC’ Use -v (or &#x60;:set -v&#x60; in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 5 | import Database.HDBC.ODBC | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 This path ought to be valid, AFAICT. And this is basically what the readme advises. What am I missing?
 I must say this is my first time using Stack, so excuse me if I&#x27;m missing something obvious!

                    <span>I installed ghc (8.10.7) and cabal(3.4.0.0) using ghcup as it&#x27;s suggested on (website)[haskell.org] but later when I open terminal and type ghci I come across a weird issue. 
 When I use arrow key to go back to old commands I typed, ghci doesn&#x27;t delete previous command but adds old command to current command. Let me try to explain it with an example.
 Let&#x27;s say I typed following via ghci:
 Prelude&gt; double x &#x3D; x + x Prelude&gt; double 10 20 Prelude&gt; 10 * 5 50 
 Now, when I press up arrow key I should see and I do see
 Prelude&gt; 10 * 5 
 But if I press up arrow key once more I should see
 Prelude&gt; double 10 
 but what I actually see is following
 Prelude&gt; 10 * double 10 
 if I press up arrow key once more, this is what I get
 Prelude&gt; 10 * double 1x &#x3D; x + x 
 It seems like ghci only remove last character but it should remove whole previous command when pressing arrow keys. It does however computes the correct code. If I press (ctrl + L) it does show correct code. (For last example it shows double x &#x3D; x + x)
 Is there a fix for this? I removed and reinstalled cabal and ghc multiple times but having the same problem. I don&#x27;t have same problem using stack repl.

                    <span>In https://stackoverflow.com/a/31328543/6394508 Object Shape is used to demonstrate the purpose of ConstraintKinds, but is the Object construct worth it at all? I&#x27;d think data SomeShape &#x3D; forall a. Shape a &#x3D;&gt; SomeShape a would work just as well, and is much light-weighted (both in verbosity and mental overhead). 
 After all, you can&#x27;t treat Object Shape and Object Animal with anything in common, a separate SomeAnimal can be no inferior. 
 Or there are scenarios that Object Shape + Object Animal be superior to SomeShape + SomeAnimal ?

                    <span>Hello everyone. I have to run some C and Fortran programs over SSH, and need to edit the source files on the shell. I think Emacs is the right tool for such a task, and it was preinstalled on the server. Though when I open a Fortran file in emacs, I find the syntax highlighting to be really weird (dark blue text over black background - completely illegible). Now I can change the theme by M-x customize-themes or M-x load-theme, but I have to do it each time I start emacs from the terminal. For instance if I make a small modification to the source, return to shell to compile, and come back to make another small modification (say correct an error) to my source file, I have to change themes twice over.
 Hence my question is basically: Where do I configure emacs to load a particular theme every time it is opened in the terminal?
 The server has GNU Emacs 24.3.1, and runs CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core). 
 Thank you.
 Edit: It would be really helpful if someone could point me to a tutorial aimed at beginner for running emacs on the terminal. I know little about how this application works beyond the basic commands to navigate, cut-paste and save.

                    <span>With this config, if I do C-x C-f upon first entering Emacs, I can navigate up and down the options ivy/counsel provides using C-n and C-p in the insert state, as expected (courtesy of evil-collection). However, every time I do C-x C-f thereafter, the bindings set in evil-collection don&#x27;t work until I first enter the normal state. It seems like this is a result of this known issue; however, doing (add-hook &#x27;ivy-mode-hook &#x27;evil-normalize-keymaps) in counsel&#x27;s :init block doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Does anyone know how to ensure that I can access evil-collection&#x27;s keybindings immediately upon entering the minibuffer with ivy instead of having to switch to the normal state and back first?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to set my mode-line color(s) based on my evil-mode state like so:
 (defun my/buffer-color-changer () &quot;Changes the color of the buffer background/foreground on evil-state changes. If provided, it will change the colors of the buffer-{path,file} and the project-{dir, root-dir}&quot; (let* ((default-color (cons (face-background &#x27;mode-line) (face-foreground &#x27;mode-line)))) (let ((color (cond ((minibufferp) default-color) ;; background foreground bfile bpath projDir projRootDir ((evil-insert-state-p) &#x27;(&quot;lawngreen&quot; &quot;#000000&quot; &quot;#000000&quot; &quot;#000000&quot; &quot;#000000&quot; &quot;#000000&quot;)) ((evil-visual-state-p) &#x27;(&quot;maroon&quot; &quot;#222222&quot; &quot;#222222&quot; &quot;#222222&quot; &quot;#222222&quot; &quot;#222222&quot;)) ((evil-normal-state-p) &#x27;(&quot;midnightblue&quot; &quot;#ffffff&quot; &quot;#ffffff&quot; &quot;#ffffff&quot; &quot;#ffffff&quot; &quot;#ffffff&quot;)) (t default-color)))) (set-face-background &#x27;mode-line (nth 0 color)) (set-face-foreground &#x27;mode-line (nth 1 color)) (if (&gt; (length color) 2) (custom-set-faces ;; left some of these face-settings out for brevity &#x27;(doom-modeline-project-root-dir ((t (:inherit (mode-line-emphasis bold) :foreground (nth 2 color)))) ) )))) (add-hook &#x27;post-command-hook #&#x27;my/buffer-color-changer) 
 I would think this would work, but I&#x27;m not completely savvy with elisp. When I attempt to evaluate this function I get the following error:
 Error in post-command-hook (my/buffer-color-changer): (wrong-type-argument stringp (nth 2 color)) 
 I&#x27;m a little lost on what&#x27;s going on. Unless I&#x27;m completely mistaken (nth 2 color) is a string (I&#x27;ve checked via (stringp (nth 2 color))). Any pointers would be great.

                    <span>Could someone help me understand the difference between these terms that I frequently see associated with what I would call “visual enhancements”. 
  
faces
 overlays 
 font-lock
 ligatures 
  
I have gotten confused about the relationship between these terms as well as how to identify / debug visual enhancement errors I run into. 
 For example, which of these is used in the following settings: - wrapping of long lines - highlighting the TODO keyword in org-mode - replacing \lambda with the Greek symbol in latex-mode or org-mode - evil-easy motion hints (that’s overlays right?)
 Thank you!

                    <span>Hi. Im playing around with display-message-or-buffer. I want to display the memory usage and cpu usage in the echo area. 
 free works just fine.
 (defun memory-usage () &quot;Display Memory Usage&quot; (interactive) (shell-command &quot;/usr/bin/free -h . display-message-or-buffer&quot;)) 
 However, Im having trouble with mpstat. Its complaining about wrong argument.
 (defun mpstat () &quot;Display CPU Usage&quot; (interactive) (shell-command &quot;/usr/bin/mpstat . display-message-or-buffer&quot;)) 
 mpstat read &quot;.&quot; as argument :/ Weird free does not. Obviously, I have no coding skills. Anyhow, I&#x27;d appreciate learning the good syntax to fix this problem im having.

                    <span>Using Emacs 27.2, Org-mode Ver 9.4.6. , Win10
 In the last few months I have been receiving constant &quot;JSON Readtable error :69&quot; when using org-export to any format. I did not have this problem when using version 26.x.
 It happens with an INCLUDE statement. The file itself is straightforward org-mode text, no images,tables etc.
 #+INCLUDE: &quot;d:/draft1/F08-Introduction.org&quot; :minlevel 1 
 If I replace the INCLUDE statement with the actual text of the file, it works properly.
 Is there something different in Emacs 27.x that would cause this? I have updated all my packages but it did not eliminate this issue. Its rendered my Emacs installation useless for formatted output when using INCLUDE.
 If you have had this problem, JSON errors, how did you fix your problem?
 Thanks. Any help appreciated.

 After waiting for some time ...while it is saying ...&quot;wrote to some file...&quot; and I press $ to get a buffer and it saying
 run git...commit...
 hint : waiting for your editor to close the file..
 waiting for emacs....
 ​
 Kinda bemused. Kindly shed some light.
 Emacs version :27.0.2
 OS: Gentoo, Arch,Slackware,Debian,Tumbleweed
 My wild guess I missed some basic configuration for magit...wondering what is that? By looking at error buffer it is certainly looking for a buffer where it can operate on, which is not invoking,
 I have stumbled over two packages &quot;git-commit&quot; and &quot;with-editor&quot; , and I have installed those ...but no avail . Wondering!
 PS : gpg ssh key added to the agent .
 Heck ....it is failing me .....the whole point boiled down , how could I sign commit if it is not prompting for passphrase??

                    <span>I want to make some text-based GUIs with some pretty basic functionality, including text-based read-only trees that can expand/collapse much like org mode.
 I want each node of the tree to have 1 or more keyboard keys that can activate an associated function.
 I looked into tree-widget.el a bit for this, but playing around with it, it either doesn&#x27;t seem to be what I want, or I completely misunderstood how to use it.
 I&#x27;m pretty familiar with Lisp, but less familiar with Emacs: could anyone give me some Emacs terminology I can use to help me find what I&#x27;m looking for? Can I use Org Mode&#x27;s trees?
 Edit: The resulting file might look something like this:
 + Root + Parent - Expanded Parent + Sub Parent Leafy-leaf^ 
 when the cursor (denoted by ^) is on Leafy-leaf, I could press something like j and it would run a command associated with Leafy-leaf and j.

                    <span>I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to have a scheduled meeting marked as a recurring event in my agenda, and then to have notes for each instance of the meeting under that as a subtree.
 Basically, I have something like this:
 * My Meeting  
 And I want a way to turn it into
 * My Meeting  **  
 i.e. make a sub-tree for the (non-repeating) current instance of the meeting, in which I can take my notes, and bump the original (repeating) meeting&#x27;s date by a week (or whatever the repeat interval is).
 Abstractly, a repeating event is an infinite sequence of events. I want to split this into the first occurrence, and the rest of the sequence.
 I&#x27;ve seen that you can do C-c C-t to use org-todo to mark a recurring event as done, but that seems to create a list-item, not an entire sub-tree.
 Is this possible? Am I going about this in the wrong way?

                    <span>Hello Reddit! I wrote a blog post about how to simplify integration tests which include some kind of external database/service. If you don&#x27;t know about the Testcontainers library - dive straight in.
 Also, I did an example of how to create your own testcontainer in case when you don&#x27;t have a predefined one. Example testcontainer is an Aerospike server that you can use in your test suites.
 Hope this helps!

                    <span>RESOLVED
 I am a bit confused on the following generic class behavior 
 Consider the following code in scala where I see error in https://scastie.scala-lang.org/
  import scala.concurrent._ import concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global class MySuper[Event &lt;: Any] (myParam: String) { def produceMessage(message: Event): Future[Unit] &#x3D; Future { println(message) } } class MySub[Int] (myParam: String) extends MySuper(myParam: String) { } object MySub { def apply(param1: String, param2: Int): Future[Unit] &#x3D; { val self &#x3D; new MySub[Int](param1) self.produceMessage(param2) } } 
 I have two questions 
  
Why produceMessage requires Nothing when the generic type is declare as Int in the subsclass in new MySub[Int](param1), I expected that the generic param type needed is Int identical to the class generic type
 Found: (param2 : Int) Required: Nothing 
 
When I changed the generic type from Int to String and param2 to String why do i get error that it requires String2 
 
 EDIT: RESOLVED turns out I am declaring the generic of my subclass incorrectly, the proper way is 
  class MySub(myParam: String) extends MySuper[Int](myParam) 
 instead of 
  class MySub[Int] (myParam: String) extends MySuper(myParam: String) {

                    <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m to be learning scala in a new role and very excited about it, but I&#x27;m very confused as to how to install it on Linux right now. The Scala page says to install Java SDK versioin 1.8.0_31, then it points me at a page that wants to install java JDK. Is there a difference and if so where can I get the SDK from please?

                    <span>Hello everyone, 
 I know there is a lot of references to learn Scala in the subreddit but I&#x27;m still confused about what would be the best platform to do it. 
 I started learning the language yesterday (directly with Scala 3) and I came across a lot of information that were contradictory (sometimes even from the Scala website). For example, I still don&#x27;t understand what should be the best way the compile and then run a program on the windows terminal. I&#x27;m not a programmer even though I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a beginner in computer science and I&#x27;m not used to all the compilation things on the cmd terminal (in general I use IDEs bc it is easier for me).
 I wrote a &quot;test.scala&quot; program printing the classic &quot;hello, world !&quot;. On the windows terminal I wrote &quot;scala3-compiler test.scala&quot; and it compiled without problems. Then, because it seems to be impossible to run it with something like &quot;scala3-run test.scala&quot;, I tried using the &quot;scalac&quot; and &quot;scala&quot; keywords but &quot;scalac test.scala&quot; didn&#x27;t compile...
 I&#x27;m thinking about just loading the files in the repl to use the functions. However, I&#x27;m following scala.zone courses and they proceed in a different way to compile and run so I&#x27;m lost.
 Well I disgressed a bit from my original question : should I keep following the scala.zone courses for Scala 3 or should I try another online course ?

                    <span>In an older version of The Archive, &#x27;Cntl+CMD+T&#x27; would switch between list types...One could highlight text and then the shortcut could number the list, or add dashes, or remove the list format altogether.  In the most recent update, this keyboard combo toggles typewriter mode on/off.
(I have an older version of The Archive on imac, and the newest version on laptop and noticed this.)
Any way we can bring this back?
Many thanks</span>

                    <span>Following @sfast &#x27;s advice on object tags, I&#x27;ve increasingly transitioned to using zettels as claims which connect two or more tag objects, and away from using zettels to refer to objects themselves. For instance, a zettel might express the following:

  
. #HumanBehavior is driven by #MentalModels, which are enacted through #EmbodiedCognition


Here, I&#x27;m using tags for objects, while the zettel itself embodies a specific claim. This practice has led to a proliferation of tags in my note system.
However, I don&#x27;t really like multi-word tags. And tagging seems like a distraction from a key human-focused aspect of intellectual work: naming things. &quot;Embodied Cognition&quot;, for example, is a term that has a specific meaning in a particular field; #EmbodiedCognition does not.

                    <span>Hi.
 I almost get the super powerful emacs IDE. The thing is, I was using it in terminal, and I tried in GUI and consumes so many resources and it is slow. And this makes me sad because I was setup for 3 days emacs and has all the features(lack a few) I would like in a IDE.
 Here is my setup, also if could you help me to order the config, because it was copy paste.
 For now I will continue using VS Code, because it is lighter than emacs.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m just above a novice when it comes to EMACS. Although I recently thought Joplin to be a good place for my notes, I found that many use EMACS for note taking. The thing is that I like copy and pasting in pictures, screenshots, etc directly into my notes. Is this something that can be efficiently achieved in EMACS? If so, how does one go about doing so?

                    <span>Hi all,
 Been an emacs user for a while and started to notice my emacs feel generally laggy. I use the GUI emacs on mac. It improved after i increased the gc-threshold, but some commands that i used frequently eg, windmove for moving around windows had ~1-2 sec lag which was not normal. So i started debugging and realized that if i invoked the function from M-x rather than the keybinding it was instantaneous. Then, i changed the keybinding of windmove from &#x27;C-c b&#x27; to &#x27;C-c C-b&#x27; and the lag was gone. After that i noticed this is happening for a lot of my commands (swiper/ ivy switch buffer etc). 
 ​
 Why is one particular keybinding inducing noticeable lag, but the other keybinding on the same function is super fast. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this and found nothing on google search. M-x profiler is also not helpful. Ideally I&#x27;d like to keep the same keybindings i have but not have this lag. Can anyone help me figure out what is going on here. Thanks.

                    <span>Hi.
 Solved: The thing is, dap just recognize the ~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1 In my case I tried: lsp-save-vscode-workspace, edit the file then load it. When you load this file, edits the lsp-session-v1 file. After this, dap recognize the root project where I want.
 I almost get the complete C++ IDE in emacs :D, I am just get this issue with dap:
  
dap recognize project root as the .cpp dir and not the projectile dir. With this issue I need to create a new launch.json file in the same dir as the .cpp dir.
 In Vs Code in launch.json I have this variable: ${command:cmake.getLaunchTargetPath} 
 In Emacs Is there something similar?

                    <span>Hello,
 When I&#x27;m looking for a file (C-x C-f) I can autocomplete. Tab is the key for completion. Now when I use a completion display package such as Vertico, I tend to use &quot;enter&quot; to validate my choice in the visual list. If I use &quot;enter&quot;, it &quot;activates&quot; the choice: if I choose a file it opens it; if I choose a directory it explores it with dired.
 I don&#x27;t like that. When I choose a directory, I actually want to go inside it to continue my search of r a file; I don&#x27;t want to open a directory (I almost never used dired). So is there a way to tell find-file or the completion frameworks &#x3D; &quot;hitting enter on a directory names should be interpreted as hitting tab on the directory name&quot;.
 I know I could fix my muscle memory, but using &quot;enter on a list&quot; is so universal that well, I&#x27;d prefer my emacs to be set up my way.
 The closest find I found is : (setq find-file-run-dired nil). But it just makes an error instead of changing its behavior.
 Thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;m having a hard time getting Emacs to pickup my ssh password, specifically with Magit. There are a few threads on e.g. Stack Exchange that go in to quite a bit of depth about this, and they are several years old. The solutions weren&#x27;t exactly pretty. So I thought I would crowdsource this to the Emacs community to see what people are doing in 2021. 
 How do you guys manage your ssh passwords such that they are integrated with Emacs? Ideally, I&#x27;d like to not have to use external packages to achieve this. I&#x27;m just tired of entering my ssh password every time I push to a remote repository.

                    <span>Hi.
 Solved: disabling (global-whitespace-mode 1) works fine
 I am working on my emacs setup, I did not use it more than 8 years and now I am so happy to return :D
 I am following this tutorial: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/ and adding more plugins, then I have this issue:

 Is there a way to fix it?

                    <span>This is a years later follow up to my previous attempt at running haskell code on my iphone. (https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4ttdz1/building_an_osxi386_to_iosarm64_cross_compiler/)
  
I need a compiler that runs on my x64 mac to build for my aarch64 iphone (as well as, ideally, the simulator).
 
My project is currently using GHC 9.0.1, so ideally I get that version. I can be flexible though.
  
I tried the following:
  
Cloned https://github.com/ResAppHealth/toolchain-wrapper and added to path. (This repo seemed more up to date than the zwerk parent.)
 
In toolchain-wrapper&#x27;s bootstrap script, changed targets&#x3D;&quot;x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios&quot;

                    <span>Suppose you have a simple data type
 data Foo &#x3D; Foo1 | Foo2 | Foo3 
 and another, more complicated one predicated on this type,
 type BarOf :: Foo -&gt; Type data family BarOf foo 
 that models the behaviour of the Bar paradigm based on which Foo it’s associated to. It would be nice to be able to pattern match on the values of Foo to completely determine this behaviour — but how, when it’s now type-level information instead of value-level?
 First, we’ll need a typeclass (aka, a function from types to values ):
 type KnownFoo :: Foo -&gt; Type class KnownFoo foo where fooVal :: prx foo -&gt; Foo instance KnownFoo &#x27;Foo1 where fooVal _ &#x3D; Foo1 instance KnownFoo &#x27;Foo2 where fooVal _ &#x3D; Foo2 instance KnownFoo &#x27;Foo3 where fooVal _ &#x3D; Foo3

GADTs
 existentials, constraints
 arbitrary kinds
 (I also like the Code representation of generics-sop)
  
Currently Generic is limited to ADTs, and only for Types and unary type constructors. This allows us to derive generic implementations like Monoid and Applicative via Generically and Generically1 respectively but with a heavier emphasis on fancy types and a growing number of type classes that don&#x27;t fit this mold¹ I think it&#x27;s due for an upgrade.
 One solution exists in the super powerful kind-generics library. Ryan Scott discussed a possible path for GHC.Generics. Maybe some changes are planned already? I&#x27;m curious about your thoughts
  
¹ More than I can list: Bifunctor, Biapplicative hierarchy, the Category/Arrow/Profunctor hierarchy, MonadTrans/ComonadTrans/IxMonadTrans, higher-order Monad and Comonad, lifted classes like Eq2, the indexed IxFunctor hierarchy and an n-ary Functor hierarchy.

                    <span>Hi,
 I’m new to org mode. Is it possible to have multiple directories for org files and org-roam?
 I would like to have my personal org files and notes for org-roam synced with my private Dropbox and all work related org-files and org-roam notes synced with my work iCloud. 
 Can this be done and preferably in a way so that if I would exclude the work org file directory, all my personal notes and todos stay the same. 
 I know that I can define multiple paths for org-agenda-files but I’m unsure of org-roam files. 
 Best regards,
 David

                    <span>Hy there!
 ​
 I have two questions;
 How do you search for the below problem?
 And how to solve it without writing out the implicit param by name, or without an inner extractor?
 ​
 fiddle; https://scastie.scala-lang.org/7iJrQMJJTkasmOCs4BtPdw
 You can write classes like this; case class MainState[S: State](subState: S) 
 How could you extract the State[S] evidence if you want to use it in a function, if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to modify the case class definition?

                    <span>When I use akka-stream I somehow always end up with method signatures that include (implicit sys: ActorSystem, mat: Materializer, ec: ExecutionContext).
 It&#x27;s tedious and gross, makes testing difficult, and feels like a general anti-pattern.
 From using ZIO a bit, it seems to not have this problem. The effect monad and runtime seem to abstract out this implicit juggling. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any tips on achieving something similar in akka-stream?
 I realize I haven&#x27;t provided an example. I&#x27;ll come back and do that if this problem isn&#x27;t clear.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using org-msg like this (great package btw, doesn&#x27;t get enough attention if you ask me):
 (use-package org-msg :config (setq org-msg-options &quot;html-postamble:nil num:nil ^:{} toc:nil author:nil email:nil&quot; ...more setq&#x27;s...) (org-msg-mode 1)) 
 I have this in my gnus-specific init.el, and until today it&#x27;s worked fine. I decided I wanted to use a custom attachment function, so I defined it did:
 (use-package org-msg :config (setq org-msg-options &quot;html-postamble:nil num:nil ^:{} toc:nil author:nil email:nil&quot; ...more setq&#x27;s...) (org-msg-mode 1) :bind (:map org-msg-edit-mode-map (&quot;C-c C-a&quot; . my/function))) 
 This doesn&#x27;t work at all. org-msg just doesn&#x27;t load in message buffers (which is the expected behaviour). What&#x27;s wierd is that defining the binding with define-key works fine---org-msg loads properly, and the key is bound as expected. This works with the define-key form inside the use-package form (in :config or :init) or outside it.
 I have used :bind (with :map) so many times before perfectly happily and I just can&#x27;t make any headway with this. I know I could just use define-key, but I really like the organization of keeping everything in use-package.
 Some things I have tried, to no avail:
  
putting it all in my standard/top-level emacsinit.el (with all my other config)
 removing everything in the :config section except (org-msg-mode)
 putting the :bind first
 putting the function&#x27;s defun before or after use-package.
 binding a different key sequence, or to a different function, or both.
  
I simply can&#x27;t understand why this is happening. What is going on?

                    <span>Hi,
 Emacs newbie and Doom user here. I&#x27;m trying out Helm instead of Ivy and I am unable to find a function or setting that replicates Ivy&#x27;s +ivy-buffer-preview. I really like seeing a preview of the buffer as I scroll by it in the buffer list.
 Is there a helm equivalent? I&#x27;m not good with elisp, so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a way to do this myself or not. 
 Any help is appreciated!

                    <span>Mainly in LSP/Company mode. I do a lot of work with Golang and Typescript and it noticeably lags when generating the suggestion list and continuing to type. Not to the point where its unusable, just to the point where its noticeable and slightly aggrevating. 
 I have ran numerous profiles which resulted in me disabling doom-modeline, lsp diagnostics modeline, and bumping gc-cons-threshold - which has made a difference, but still has the noticeable lag. 
 Meanwhile neovim runs smoothly popping up suggestions immediately and no input lag at all. Is it just reality that lua &gt; elisp from a speed standpoint and this is one of the tradeoffs that comes to using emacs? 
 Also worth noting that I am on MacOS which i know has multiple reports of display related slowdowns.

                    <span>I am trying to make a custom link-hint type for org agenda items (e.g., each line that is not a block header in org agenda). To do so I need a predicate function that returns non-nil if the thing at point is an item that could be acted on by &#x60;org-agenda-goto&#x60;. 
 ​
 I am having troubling finding such a function but I imagine it must exist. Help would be much appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with sidebar as a child frame that is displayed on the left side of a regular frame and can be used to display any kind of information. I used it mostly to display a mue4e dashboard (https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-dashboard). I did not find how to have per-frame theme and I ended up exploiting the dark/light mode frame settings. Any theme that includes the two modes should work. I used it in conjunction with nano-theme (https://github.com/rougier/nano-theme) and the sidebar uses the dark version.
 Code is available at https://github.com/rougier/nano-sidebar but I only tested it on OSX and I don&#x27;t know if it works on other systems.

                    <span>We all love org-mode. It is light-weight and fully extensible. However, when it comes to blogging, it doesn&#x27;t seem easy to create a page that&#x27;s elegant. What do I mean by &quot;elegant&quot;? Well, just take a look at some pictures in google-search-image//wix-blog. 
 I&#x27;m not coming here just to whine. In fact, I hope to collect some of your ideas. What do you think would make org-mode blogging produce elegant sites (closer to the industrial standard)?

 &#x60;fdisk&#x60; is in &#x60;/usr/sbin&#x60;. I have the following code in my config but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help.
 (let ((inhibit-message t)
 (message-log-max nil))
 (add-to-list &#x27;exec-path &quot;~/.local/bin&quot;)

 I am guessing that I am setting the wrong variable or something else equally stupid. Could someone help point me in the right direction?

                    <span>Hi, I am doing some research and compiling a list of most important topics in teaching Haskell and what can be very good examples to teach those topics. 
 So a list of topics that I have already listed are (Please correct me if i am wrong)
  
higher-order functions (HOF);
 purity;
 recursion;
 referential transparency.
 Strict and lazy evaluation
 type systems.
  
I would very much appreciate if you can guide me here. I am very new to Haskell and just exploring for the sake of comparison with OOP. I intend to persuade faculty to teach it as a full course.

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious as to why String is used almost ubiquitously throughout the GHC codebase and many Haskell codebases in general. In any other language, building a string as a LinkedList is practically unheard of. That being said, Haskell is not every other language, and I&#x27;m curious to hear if this representation has any benefits over a packed string type due to the GHC runtime, garbage collector, or something like that.
 Any thoughts?

                    <span>In Haskell, is the styling where a function has a prime marker i.e:
 mapError 
 vs
 mapError&#x27; 
 does this just mean &quot;another version&quot; of the same function? like with a different signature?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 Today I&#x27;m happy to announce the release of version 0.20 of my numerical optimization libraries that I call Goal (Geometric OptimizAtion Libraries). I&#x27;m a postdoc working in the areas of machine learning and computational neuroscience, and I&#x27;ve been working on Goal for about 5 years. I&#x27;ve been doing my research with these libraries for the duration, but I now feel that they&#x27;re well-developed and feature rich enough that they might be of wider interest.
 Goal is essentially my attempt at doing type-safe numerical optimization, with types based on information geometry, which is the combination of Riemannian geometry with probability theory, exponential families, and statistics. Some features include:

                    <span>I reckon the best way to get comfortable with the language is to put it to use on meaningful tasks. On that note, I was hoping to (at least, have a go at) rewrite a small, personal, script I use at work. That script requires connecting to an Oracle DB on Linux, however, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get started.
 Python and Java have cx_Oracle and JDBC/Spring (respectively) offering plenty support out of the box. From a user perspective, their respective APIs take a database name (from which, I believe, the database is resolved via. $TNS_ADMIN and tnsnames.ora) and password. I couldn&#x27;t find any mention/examples that straight forward with Haskell.
 The only related post I could find doesn&#x27;t offer much in terms of a solution. Do people use Haskell on OracleDB? Could I get some pointers?

 Sorry for the shitty formatting. I&#x27;m completely new to programming so I don&#x27;t really know what any of this means or what to do. I tried looking for solutions but it seems many of the answers are very outdated. I did manage to install stack, could I use stack to install ghc?

                    <span>I have on and off used Haskell a bit and have convinced myself to use it. I just got what Monads and the like actually do and mean. I can look at Haskell code and properly understand it, but as soon as I get to actually do some excersises or anything. I put down some code and it NEVER WORKS! It&#x27;s been like 6 months and I can&#x27;t write basic code. For the record I can and have coded applications (and guis) in other functional programming languages but can never wrap my head around how haskell wants me to think!
 Can anyone give me any advice on how to improve or what to think when coding in Haskell?
 Thanks in advance.
 CLARITY: I like the GHC compiler but can&#x27;t get the result I am looking for. I have read the &quot;Learn you a haskell for the great good&quot; book. I am currently going through 99 problems in haskell. The real problem i think i am having is recursion. I can only really code in (and have only properly tried) FP Languages like Lisp especially Common Lisp.

 org-superstar has this annoying thing where there are dots on the bullets.
 Org-Bullets is apparently legacy now so I was wondering if its still okay to use or if org-superstar is the better option. 
 Which one should I use?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on keeping some documents that have a single content.org file, and is included in two separate files (slides.org for beamer export and notes.org for latex export).
 I&#x27;m running into image sizing issues. For example, in Beamer I&#x27;m fine with the default 0.9\textwidth or may like to specify something to fill a slide with the full \textwidth. However, in the LaTeX export, I&#x27;m using something based on the article class and a 0.9\textwidth is massive.
 In my beamer export, org-beamer-export-to-pdf from ox-beamer, it seems to be ignoring the line
 #+attr_beamer: :width .5\textwidth 
 and keeping the default. However it will change if I use
 #+attr_latex: :width .5\textwidth 
 But of course, then the article export for my notes (org-latex-export-to-pdf) will then have a large image.
 Right now, I can specify about 3.5in and it sort of works for both, but I&#x27;m not understanding why beamer is ignoring my attr_beamer keywords. I feel like I&#x27;m missing something basic, so any articles or files to read is appreciated.
 I had tried to follow something like [[ https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/beamer-dual-format.html ][this setup]] and can throw together a MWE later today if that helps.

                    <span>Hello, I have these Org properties that I&#x27;d like to re-use for multiple headlines. The properties always stay the same and in same order.
 :PROPERTIES: :Genre: :Barcode: :Label: :CatalogNumber: :ReleaseCountry: :ReleaseDate: :SourceMedia: :END: 
 At the moment for each headline I need to type out the same block of properties which is time consuming.
 * First Headline :PROPERTIES: type out all the properties :END: * Second Headline :PROPERTIES: type out all the properties :END: ... so on 
 The best I can do is copy and paste the properties. However, I was wondering if there is a way to automatically insert the property block above just by typing something short then pressing TAB, just like a snippet.
 I know there is org-capture however I would like the template to be inserted inside the document while actually working inside the document.

                    <span>Hi!
 New to Scala3, and curious what the best practices might be for strictly controlling data for class instances?
 Concretely - I want to model data coming in from a stream in a class as set-on-instantiation (but otherwise immutable) - where the values are bounded in some way - such that an instance cannot exist with values outside those ranges.
 My first instinct is a case class with a companion object and an apply method that performs validation. (Ideally returning an Option or Result - but also potentially just throwing an Exception). Does that seem idiomatic for Scala3? Or is it simpler to just have a class with a constructor and private &quot;val&quot; members?
 Warm thanks!

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been fiddling with a type-safe way to copy immutable data in a concise way that allows for inheritance and I think I managed to come really close thanks to some Scala3 features and some unorthodox use of them. Have a look here for the full code example and implementation.
 Here&#x27;s a demo of what it allows you to do:
 Scala val first &#x3D; Person(&quot;The First&quot;, 1) val second &#x3D; first.having(_.name &#x3D; &quot;The Second&quot;) // copied, first remains the same val third &#x3D; second.having(_.age &#x3D; 50) val error &#x3D; second.having(_ &#x3D;&gt; first.name &#x3D; &quot;FirstMutated&quot;) // ^^^^^ Object (first : sgl.util.Person) is past it&#x27;s rebuilding phase.

                    <span>i have to read all csv files from a folder and represent them in json format, 
 {
 &quot;type&quot;: &quot;csv&quot;,
 &quot;files&quot;: [
 &quot;a.csv&quot;, &quot;b.csv&quot;
 ]
 }
 ​
 then i have to separate the metadata and data from a specific file and represent it like this, 
 {
 &quot;error&quot;: false,
 &quot;message&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
 &quot;data&quot;: {
 &quot;resultSet&quot;: [
 [&quot;Draft&quot;, &quot;53.0&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot;],
 [&quot;Overdue 1&quot;, &quot;49.0&quot;, &quot;3.0&quot;],
 [&quot;Overdue 2&quot;, &quot;53.0&quot;, &quot;2.0&quot;]
 ],
 &quot;metaData&quot;: [{
 &quot;colIndex&quot;: 1,
 &quot;colName&quot;: &quot;Status&quot;,
 &quot;colType&quot;: &quot;StringType&quot;
 }, {
 &quot;colIndex&quot;: 2,
 &quot;colName&quot;: &quot;Aging&quot;,
 &quot;colType&quot;: &quot;DoubleType&quot;
 }, {
 &quot;colIndex&quot;: 3,
 &quot;colName&quot;: &quot;Count&quot;,
 &quot;colType&quot;: &quot;DoubleType&quot;
 }]
 }
 }
 ​
 i have googled it but i can&#x27;t find the right way to do this. Can anyone write me the code for this or where i should search.

                    <span>I thought I&#x27;d try out some better monospace fonts for emacs and my terminal, kitty and decided on &quot;Fira Mono Regular&quot;.
 So I set the default font in both emacs and kitty to Monospace and using ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf to point to Fira Regular, the result is very different in the 2 programs. emacs renders almost a bold font while kitty (and alacritty) are much lighter. Any idea what&#x27;s going on?
 The image below is from &#x27;emacs -Q&#x27; to eliminate any funky stuff I may have done in ~/.emacs.d
 The emacs is PureGTK emacs-28.0.50-1.20210814.git92bc69e.fc34.x86_64
 I&#x27;ve read through https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetFonts without any enlightenment!!

 emacs -Q session - heavier font rendering

                    <span>I&#x27;ve gotten quite used to comint for inferior shells, including python. I often interact with micropython on microcontrollers over a serial port. serial-term works well, but without any of the rich history, history search, etc. I rely on with comint. I.e. it works only as a terminal emulator. 
 Does anyone know how to interact with a prompt-based command running over a serial port using comint (i.e. line-by-line)?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got the feeling that this might become one of my most popular blog articles: The right way of using Org mode
 In short: there is no right way.
 If you don&#x27;t agree or if you doubt my statement, you really should read the article. My blog tells me that the average reader should not spend more than four minutes for reading it.
 It&#x27;s my new go-to URL for Org mode beginners who are trying to get how to use Org mode properly. You might feel the same.
 Have fun.

 EDIT: I&#x27;ve added it here:
 https://reddit.com/link/pemtrz/video/tvudzdu96jk71/player
 I couldn&#x27;t really find a &#x27;local&#x27; alternative to Goodreads I liked, so the package is really my shot at that (: - comments etc welcome

                    <span>In Clojure there is a useful function &quot;defonce&quot; that only sets a value to a variable if it has not been set. My current elisp effort is to toggle an emacs face value between a new value and back again to its original value, whatever it is. This is the way I came up with by utilizing bound-and-true-p with or, but I realize there might be a function I am missing or an idiom I haven&#x27;t observed for this use case. Suggestions are welcome.
 (defun tsa/god-cursor () (setq tsa/cursor-bg (or (bound-and-true-p tsa/cursor-bg) (face-attribute &#x27;cursor :background))) (if (or god-local-mode buffer-read-only) (progn (setq cursor-type &#x27;hbar) (set-face-attribute &#x27;cursor nil :background &quot;#11ff33&quot;)) (progn (setq cursor-type &#x27;box) (set-face-attribute &#x27;cursor nil :background tsa/cursor-bg))))

                    <span>I use &#x60;olivetti-mode&#x60; to center the text in some modes, including org. Recently I found it does not work for org mode anymore, after some updates I think. That means nothing happen after I turn on &#x60;olivetti-mode&#x60;. It still works fine for other modes I believe, like latex mode.
 Does anyone have the similar issue?

                    <span>Hey emacsers. Yesterday I finished a first prototype of phpinspect.el. It&#x27;s a project of mine that has been sitting unfinished in my dotfile repo for years. This weekend I decided to see if I could get it in a working state as I have to write a lot of PHP in the near future.
 My problem with LSP mode and php language servers has been that they try to parse and cache every single file in your entire project. I have had php-language-server die on me with memory leaks from indexing an enterprise application with 1000s of classes and trying to keep it all in memory. phpinspect.el only parses files on an as-needed basis, kind of like the php autoloader, and keeps its cache in a global variable which you can unset to purge it.
 If enough people are interested I intend to do some cleanup, write s…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been running PureGTK emacs for some time on my laptop and very happy with it - so I installed the same package (emacs-28.0.50-1.20210814.git92bc69e.fc34.x86_64) on another machine but there is a bit of a mystery about the &quot;Options-&gt;Set Default Font...&quot; menu item.
 On my old laptop (where I&#x27;ve been running pureGTK for some time) that menu item invokes a GTK dialog to pick the font:
 ​
 result of pgtk-popup-font-panel
 On the new machine, I get an ugly-arse menu selector:
 ​
 ​
 result of mouse-select-font
 Digging into it, I find that the menu button invokes &quot;x-select-font&quot; if it exists, otherwise &quot;mouse-select-font&quot; which is the ugly one. On the old laptop (where &quot;x-select-font&quot; is working) I have:
 x-select-font is a function alias and interactive for pgtk-popup-font-panel, defined in C source code. 
 On the new machine, there is no such alias or function as &quot;x-select-font&quot; - although pgtk-popup-font-panel _does_ exist.
 I can&#x27;t see where &quot;x-select-font&quot; is aliased in my ~/.emacs.d or /usr/share/emacs - except for a mention in the DOC file and /usr/share/emacs/28.0.50/lisp/term/pgtk-win.el.gz - why would this latter file be ignored?
 I can do the aliasing manually:
 (defalias &#x27;x-select-font &#x27;pgtk-popup-font-panel &quot;Pop up the font panel. This function has been overloaded in Nextstep.&quot;) 
 ... and it works like the old machine. But why is that not done for me automatically in the new machine? Any idea what&#x27;s going on here?

                    <span>Hi, Emacs newbie here.
 I&#x27;m trying out dart lsp-mode with company and there seems to be a bug; Anytime i use the dropdown completion feature for a method with arguments, instead of making the arguments tabbable (highlight the first argument,  goes to the next, S- to the previous), just like with yasnippet and company + irony, it rather inserts the arguments as raw text and puts the point after the closing bracket,  does nothing.
 ​
 The argument is tinted a bit, as if it tries to support it, but it something went wrong
 is the problem with company/lsp-mode/lsp-dart/emacs? Is there any way I can fix it? or should I open an issue on github?
 BTW any tips to make lsp-mode faster would be appreciated. I&#x27;m using widows 10 and the experience isn&#x27;t as smooth compared to vscode

 ASCII text in Braille font (top) converted to PS file (bottom)
 For Grade 1 Braille, you can enter ASCII text and then change the font-family to Braille font (font needs installation). The same can then be printed using Emacs.

                    <span>C-p in vscode help me to immediately open a file in the project just typing the filename. Is possible to have a similar functionality inside Emacs?
 Is the only functionality that speed up a lot my development, and I&#x27;m missing while using Emacs doing front-end stuff.

                    <span>p.s. since I don&#x27;t really know a lot about those non-Lisp weirdo config languages, if I&#x27;m to implement support for any non-Lisp editor I&#x27;ll probably just run Emacs on every peer as backend and write a thin wrapper to synchronize the background Emacs with whatever editor. Unless someone sophisticated in those editor is helping, of course.

                    <span>I want language-server/ide like support for python in emacs-ipython-notebook, but I ran into some issues. I installed elpy and all of the required packages required to get it working in emacs-ipython-notebook, but I&#x27;m getting errors. If any of you could take a look at the .emacs config that I used to set this up.
 Note: in the ein faq, it says:
 &#x60;
 get IDE-like behavior? The official python module for EIN is elpy, installed separately. Other program modes for non-python kernels may be installed with varying degrees of EIN compatibility.

 So, I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m having trouble getting elpy to work properly with ein?

                    <span>JSON or CSV rendering is customizable, but not extensible. It&#x27;s easy to change whitespace amounts or quoting rules, but by the time you&#x27;re rendering, the types you&#x27;re looking at are strictly limited, there aren&#x27;t even any type variables.
 Meanwhile Show is extensible, but not customizable. It can render user-defined types, but there&#x27;s only one way it&#x27;s going to render anything. (I suppose showsPrec means it&#x27;s a bit more than one, but close enough.)
 A thing I think I&#x27;d find useful for debugging is something that&#x27;s both extensible and customizable, letting the top-level caller control how much of a data structure to see. Let&#x27;s call it gist, and assume it&#x27;s implemented by a typeclass Gist. It might be that the instance for Gist a &#x3D;&gt; Gist [a] by default works much like show, with gistDefault …</span>

 I say &quot;used to&quot; because this PR on Iterated Function Systems (2:34 minute companion video) has been stuck for a while for lack of available Haskell reviewers, so I thought I would reach out here. 
 If anyone would spend a few minutes to help out and review it, I would appreciate it. I would even consider awarding the free Reddit award I got today!

 I tried to use visual-line-mode and visual-fill-column and it did work, but I am interested in hard wrapping so I went to auto-fill-mode which did not work inside source code blocks (according to my tests). Did I miss anything?

                    <span>In my play webapp, web I click back button of browser, the URL changes but the page does not change. Similarly when I click the front button, after navigating back, the URL keeps changing but the webpage remains the same.
 So if I am on localhost:9000/A/B/C/D and I click back, the URL will change to localhost:9000/A/B/C but the webpage remains the same. I checked the network in browser console and no request is being sent to the router/backend. On reloading the page, the webpage expected from a particular URL loaded.
 To solve this issue I added a javascript file which listens to the event popstate and everytime I press back(The URL chanegs) and it reloads the page from the URL.
 By doing this a request is sent via the Router and which is expected to be seen gets loaded. This however is causing me problem. When I do this, the front button of the browsers gets greyed out. window.history.forward(1) gives me undefined. Similar is the case with window.history.back(-1).What should I do? Please help.

                    <span>Hello yesterday I asked https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/iit6o1/anything_new_in_scala_3/ about things in Scala that would help my use of it (conciseness) and got some very nice answers to get me excited. ( On that note I wonder if there should be a better arrangement of features not as a list but as a category- say conciseness, interop with java, advanced type stuff, quick repl usage, maintainable enterprise software dev etc ) . Also, I&#x27;m not going to lie, some of my interest was indeed dampened by the earlier FUD, and might have checked it out earlier. I would suggest the marketing team starts calling it scala 3 right now and pushes this as a beta to help renew interest. 
 I have one more thing in my wish list that i&#x27;ve been wondering about- (i&#x27;m not an advanced guy who understands…</span>

                    <span>Daily ICFP
Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences.
Other posts in this series:
ICFP - Day 0
ICFP - Day 1
ICFP - Day 2
ICFP - Day 3
ICFP - Day 4
Day 5 - Friday
These notes follow Arnaud, Noon and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order. (The talks are not publicly posted at the time
of publication of this post, but we expect they will be over the
coming weeks.)
Arnaud — Parafuzz: Coverage-guided Property Fuzzing for Multicore OCaml programs: this is in the context of multicore OCaml (multicore OCaml has algebraic effects). The authors use algebraic effects to abstract over concurrency primitives, so that they can test concurrency property with the AFL fuzzer (AFL tries generate random input…</span>

                    <span>A Zettelkasten may look something like the image above, where the arrows represent the direction of the links and the boxes a particular kind of Zettel..
Links aren&#x27;t always bidirectional. E.g.: Let&#x27;s say I have an overview Zettel on Maria Popova&#x27;s note-taking method. From this Zettel, I may link to a Zettel explaining how she uses sticky tab notes. But, the latter Zettel might not link to the former.
Another thing to note is that the item in the bottom of the image may link to further details. This might happen when you break down a Zettel that violates the Principle of Atomicity. E.g.:
Topic-based overview: &quot;Maria Popova&#x27;s note-taking system.&quot;
Idea relevant to the overview: &quot;Idea index definition.&quot;
A detail of the idea: &quot;Reading is about identifying patterns.&quot;
A detail of the detail: &quot;Pattern definition.&quot;
I based my diagram on what&#x27;s been discussed in the Zettelkasten blog, so others&#x27; Zettelkasten might look different.
Questions for the reader:
What would you change of my diagram?
How does your Zettelkasten look like?</span>

                    <span>Hi!
I&#x27;m an 20-year-old female. I have a bunch of mental issues that are either inherent or results of life experience. I love reading - the only thing that keeps me from continuing to read is mental fatigue, lack of sleep. To me reading is a way of escape.
When I acquire new knowledge, I find myself a little more free from all the mental stuff. Sometimes I find myself doing things in slow motion because my brain is reserving energy for processing information.
However I&#x27;m not so happy with the amount of info I retain so I have been looking for a way to take better notes and Zettelkasten sounds like what I need! I have been reading about it yesterday evening but I&#x27;m still not able to fully grasp this method (I find myself in slow motion again).
But anyways, nice to meet you, everyone!</span>

 Any way to get it back or is gone forever? Not in autosaves or backups either.

                    <span>Hi I&#x27;m wondering if anyone can help me with two questions that I have concerning emacs:
  
How can I use emacs to help tag files on my harddrive? Would tagging or org-attach be the logical option here?
 Is it possible to create an easy way to quickly write a unique tag, that contains the date and time as a unique identifier, using Yasnippet to create an identifier for logs/entries into a journal file?
  
Thanks for advance for any answers.

                    <span>So, a month on, I&#x27;m still trying to get org to export to HTML. I&#x27;ve narrowed it down to something connected with HTML mode itself and so I can now get the error message (&quot;(void-variable css-mode-syntax-table)&quot;) at will by starting emacs and opening any html file. This gives the message and leaves the buffer in fundamental mode.
 If I open a file, say &quot;dummy.xxx&quot; and switch to html mode I don&#x27;t have a problem, nor do html files which gave the error give it again if I do &quot;M-x html-mode&quot;.
 emacs -Q does not have the problem (the file opens in &quot;HTML+&quot; mode, and org files convert just fine) but starting emacs with an empty .emacs file does throw the error and org will not export to HTML, reporting the error and bailing.
 I can&#x27;t find any way to get bug-hunter to trace this down.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a new Emacs user. I follow the SystemCrafter&#x27;s tutorial on Emacs from scratch and in order to install doom-modeline I need to install all-the-icons package.
 I added
 (use-package all-the-icons)
 to my init.el but getting 
 Error (use-package): Failed to install all-the-icons: https://melpa.org/packages/all-the-icons-20210827.1118.tar: Not found
 Error (use-package): Cannot load all-the-icons 
 Am I missing something? 
 I use Ubuntu 20.04, Emacs 27.2 if that is important

                    <span>I have been trying to investigate why mu4e sub-processes (such as mu4e-proc and mu4e-update) after exiting stick around as zombies. (They show in list-processes and process-attributes show them with zombie status. This ends up causing problems with launching subsequent sync operations).
 After doing some further testing, it seems this is the case for all sub-processes launched in emacs with my setup. For example, launching a simple process that just sleeps for 20 and exits:
 (start-process &quot;my-process&quot; &quot;foo&quot; &quot;sleep&quot; &quot;20&quot;) 
 This process continues to show under list-processes well after it has exited. It&#x27;s attributes also show that it is a zombie process. 
 Digging in further, the docs say that the variable delete-exited-processes controls whether or not these get cleaned up. It is set to t. So I would assume these should be getting cleaned. Yet looking further into the list-processes function, it seems to clean up processes that have a state of exit, signal or closed, which makes sense. 
 Yet in my testing above with the sleep process, it is showing with a state of run (despite that fact the the process has exited and the attributes show it as a zombie).
 So it seems that even when processes are exiting normally, they never switch into the exit or closed state, become zombies, and never get cleaned up by emacs. 
 A bit in the weeds here, but was curious if someone has any insight into what is happening?

                    <span>Have anyone here also encountered all-the-icons displaying wrong icons? I found many reports of this back in 2018 related to some font-lock+ change but as I understand it, it should just be fixed in the upstream. Any idea what can be causing the issue now, please?

                    <span>Hello there, I got ein working with python jupiter notebooks in emacs. It&#x27;s ok but I&#x27;m missing a lot of functionality, I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to correctly configure ein in my .emacs config so that images render, such as plots from matplotlib and widgets from ipywidgets. I would also like good ide like support, like autocompletion with jedi, and good documentation at the bottom of emacs. Vscode and atom with the hydrogen package works phenomenal out of the box, but ein feels primitive starting out, and it&#x27;s difficult trying to find good documentation specific to my use-case. I&#x27;m also looking to find how to change the position of the jupiter notebooks output.
 Anyways, if any of you have some documentation and tips to help resolve these issues, thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>This is an elementary question, and I&#x27;m embarrassed to be asking it, but, well ... it&#x27;s still confusing me. I&#x27;m try to set M-up as a keybinding in a particular mode, like this:
  (add-hook &#x27;this-mode-hook &#x27;lambda () (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;specific-function) (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;another-function))) 
 Now the F9 keybinding works fine, but the M-up always returns an error when I enter that mode:
 M- must prefix a single character, not up
 I&#x27;ve tried using various combinations: &quot;M-&quot;, &quot;\M-&quot; but the same error is returned. Clearly there&#x27;s something very elementary I&#x27;m missing here - but I can&#x27;t find what it is. 
 I should add that this is Emacs in Windows: GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 1, x86_64-w64-mingw32).
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using doom-emacs and got annoying behavior with tmux, every time Im switching pane from one with emacs to different one emacs inserts &#x27;O&#x27; symbol, but on switch back it inserts &#x27;I&#x27;. 
 &#x27;sed -n l&#x27; now shows anything on tmux pane switch so I can&#x27;t map key sequence to anything too.
 Why that happens on how is right way to dealing with that?

                    <span>So ideally, I would like to generate a list of N 0.0%-100.0% elements with 0.1 as step, however 0 to 1000 with 1 as a step may be eaiser since I don&#x27;t have to deal with floats. I had no idea how to generate this in haskell so I ended up just making a bunch of lists with random numbers that sum to 1. See below for code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; type Weight &#x3D; Float
 nWeights :: Int -&gt; IO ([Weight]) nWeights n &#x3D; replicateM n $ randomRIO (0.0,100.0)
 balancedWeights :: [Weight] -&gt; [Weight] balancedWeights ws &#x3D; map (\x -&gt; x / (sum ws)) ws
 portfolioWeights :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; IO [[Weight]] portfolioWeights sim n &#x3D; replicateM sim $ fmap balancedWeights (nWeights n) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, of course this will only really work if I create a REALLY large list and becuase of the distribution, alot of lists will be &quot;duplicates&quot;. Since the normal distribution would would for example create [0.33,0.33,0.33] where N&#x3D;3
 Im really stumped as to how i would generate this list in a recursive manner? Any help/hints is very appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking to using org mode files as a way to encode some work documentation (book outlines). Those files would be edited locally and stored in git. I&#x27;ve seen a few org-mode webapps, but they are designed to run in a server and sychronize files to some cloud service. 
 I&#x27;d like something you could run locally (Linux, macOS), that provides an easier UI than Emacs and folding and editing of properties. It can be a webapp...

                    <span>I use org-expiry to expire old tasks. I really like this functionality, but I don&#x27;t like manually expiring. I&#x27;m looking for either via a script I can schedule with run-at-time or something I can add to before-save-hook that automatically expires applicable entries. 
 I&#x27;m not good at elisp yet so maybe I&#x27;m going in the wrong direction, but I tried a function like this:
 (defun expire &quot;&quot; (interactive &quot;r&quot;) (org-expiry-process-entries (0 1000) ) 
 The arguments for org-expiry-process-entries is beg and end per the source file, and the function will &quot;Process all expired entries between BEG and END.
 I can take the interactive part out to run as a script, but with that in for testing, it says: wrong number of arguments (lambda nil &quot;&quot; (interactive &quot;r&quot;) (org-expiry-process-entries (0 1000))), 2 on a file that has &gt;1000 lines - let alone it&#x27;s better to use something like (org-expiry-process-entries ((beginning-of-buffer) (end-of-buffer))), which also fails with the same message.
 The closest other script I can find out there is this post by John Wiegley about auto archiving done entries, but this code is way above my head and it seems like org-expiry-process-entries does what I want, just interactively.
 Does anyone have a process like this or suggestions on how I can make this process work?

 Now adventurous people can just M-x package-install crdt and M-x crdt-share-buffer to try it out!
 Edit: Feel free to post your feature requests or any crazy ideas here or to https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el/-/issues! This will help me make a plan for future development.

                    <span>use-package&#x27;s :after causes the configuration of a package to be wrapped in an eval-after-load block, and it&#x27;s causing some unexpected timing issues with which package has its configuration done first. Notably, if I do:
 (use-package evil-org :after org ... ;;config for evil-org ) (use-package evil-org-agenda :after (org evil-org) ... ;;config for evil-org-agenda ) (use-package org-agenda :after (org evil-org evil-org-agenda) ... ;;config for org-agenda ) 
 ... and then call org-agenda, the order of configuration is 1. org-agenda, 2. evil-org-agenda, 3. evil-org - the opposite order of what I&#x27;d expect.
 Here&#x27;s a pastebin of my config with the use-package macros expanded and cleaned up a bit, so if someone would be willing to help me understand the life cycle, I&#x27;d really appreciate it. I think I understand the beginning:
  
I call org-agenda using C-c a
 org-agenda requires org and triggers org&#x27;s loading
 The eval-after-load &#x27;org block in evil-org&#x27;s block is triggered and does its setup of hooks. At this point, evil-org isn&#x27;t truly loaded yet, since its config block inside an eval-after-load &#x27;evil-org doesn&#x27;t run.
  
However, after this point I&#x27;m lost. We&#x27;ve just established that evil-org isn&#x27;t loaded, but the next thing to run is the stuff inside org-agenda&#x27;s config block, which requires (org evil-org evil-org-agenda) to be loaded - which implies we skipped both the eval-after-load &#x27;evil-org mentioned above as well as evil-org-agenda&#x27;s config block, which only required (org evil-org).
 The documentation for eval-after-load specifies that if FILE is loaded, the body is evaluated immediately afterwards. How then is it possible for org, evil-org, and evil-org-agenda to go from unloaded to loaded without triggering the stuff inside (use-package &#x27;evil-org ...) or (use-package &#x27;evil-org-agenda ...) first?

                    <span>Hi. Couple days ago I saw a video on youtube about EXWM, that blew my mind. So I thought to switch from dwm to EXWM, but I never used emacs, I&#x27;m learning it now, that&#x27;s quite easy. The thing that most impressed me besides emacs in itself was the Lisp language, such a cool language!
 I switched from Windows to Linux because it is more flexible and it lets you customize a lot of things. I wish to have a Dynamic OS, but with Tilling Window Manager like dwm It is a tough task to achieve, so maybe EXWM + Emacs can do what I want.
 But before I dive into the emacs world I have a few questions:
 Can I have a statusbar integrated with modeline likes this:
 https://preview.redd.it/s6wkhsea65k71.png?width&#x3D;1047&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;7d4846e51146409e7d25a78866773027c67e44e2
 Can I have custom mini-buffers that does stuff like show a playlist of music/videos and support custom formatting style and images?
 Can I have an image frame in different workspaces as background and still be able to write text? Its similar to the concept of setting a wallpaper with feh or hsetroot and make emacs transparent, but on emacs buffers instead on the X11 thing. There are some DEs that allow you to have different wallpapers per workspace.
 I know I can intercept a function call and adds other funcionality, like change the wallpaper with hsetroot. But doing like that I would see my wallpapers behind the emacs, I want to see like if I had spawned sxiv in a buffer with EXWM.
 Since emacs is a GUI application, I believe all of this is possible. I don&#x27;t care If I will have to write 1000 lines of e-lisp or more, if this is possible, I will do my best to accomplish it.

                    <span>Is there a way to temporarily disable parsing the buffer for errors in compilation mode without doing something obnoxious like removing all the patterns from the compilation errors alist?
 I have a data-build process that I run as a compilation, and the error checking matches a time stamp as an error, and tries to open a file based on it, which is a pain. I could find the exact pattern that&#x27;s doing the match and remove it—it&#x27;s likely that I don&#x27;t need it for anything I&#x27;m doing anyway—but honestly, there are zero times when I want that buffer parsed for errors. I just want to shut them off while the compilation is running, and then I&#x27;ll turn them back on after.

                    <span>Hi!
 Is there a way to duplicate the current frame and open windows?
 Most of the time, my Emacs window takes up half the screen, but sometimes I need to temporarily add buffers from the project to the screen and I want to do this in another frame so as not to waste time closing additional buffers.
 I&#x27;m tried many approach, but the new frame only opens one buffer. And new frame shifted from original position. Any help is greatly appreciated.
 (defun bss/duplicate-frame () (interactive) (let* ( (frame (selected-frame)) (fw (frame-width)) (fh (frame-height)) (fp (frame-position)) ) ;; (frame-configuration-to-register ?1) (window-configuration-to-register ?1) ;; (setq my-window-list (current-frame-configuration)) ;; (make-frame-command) (setq frame (make-frame)) ;; (select-frame frame) (select-frame-set-input-focus frame) ;; (set-frame-configuration my-window-list) (set-frame-width frame fw nil nil) (set-frame-height frame fh nil nil) (set-frame-position (car fp) (cdr fp)) (jump-to-register ?1) ;; (jump-to-frame-config-register ?1) ))

                    <span>Is it possible to get HLS support for single .hs files using nvim-lspconfig?
 I used a different client for lsp previously and got hls working. Now I wanted to try out nvims built in lsp client and lspconfig to get something quickly up and running.
 However, it seems that this only works in projects which use stack or have certain kinds of files like hie.yaml.
 I am just trying out some basic things, in single files and would love to get HLS running this way.

                    <span>Hello,
 I have been on a small personal mission to try to understand Haskell&#x27;s type system a bit better by inspecting how &amp; why GHC arrives at particular type errors in my code.
 I have a bigger program that I am trying to understand (and will likely post at some point), but I have isolated a small piece that I can ask an intelligent question of.
 I have this script:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell
 !/usr/bin/env stack
 -- stack --resolver lts-18.5 exec ghci --package mtl
 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
 import Control.Monad.Except (MonadError, runExceptT) import Control.Monad.Reader (MonadReader)
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; pure ()
 action :: (MonadReader env m, MonadError Char (t m), MonadReader Double (t m)) &#x3D;&gt; t m [Integer] action &#x3D; undefined

                    <span>Hello Haskell!
 I&#x27;ve recently started working on a project that allows the creation of IQ files that can be plaid back through SDRs (code here). Heavily influenced by GNURadio, this project allows easy modulation/synthesis of data on the command line and it makes use of the Pipes library, keeping the runtime memory footprint as low as possible.
 I&#x27;m looking to extend this by adding:
  
More modulation types
 Demodulation
 A set of components that can be composed together at runtime.
  
That last point is an interesting one. I&#x27;m aware that Pipes speed mainly comes from fusion optimisation. I was thinking that it would be nice to have something similar to gcc&#x27;s libgccjit, allowing JIT optimisation of a composed pipeline, increasing performance. Another nice side-effect of this approach is that by using the type system, you could have runtime typechecking of the pipeline, preventing uncomposable components to be connected. I couldn&#x27;t find anything in GHC that facilities this unfortunately.
 Feedback appreciated!

                    <span>Hi all, I am creating an Org mode template for a koma letter. All works well. This is the org file:
 #+LATEX_CLASS: my-letter #+DATE: \today #+AUTHOR: Sender name #+SUBJECT: A simple letter #+FROM_ADDRESS: Sender address #+FROM_ADDRESS: Sender city #+TO_ADDRESS: Receiver #+TO_ADDRESS: Receiver address #+TO_ADDRESS: Receiver city #+OPENING: Dear John, #+CLOSING: Yours truly, #+SIGNATURE: Jane #+LANGUAGE: en #+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA: \setplength{toaddrhpos}{-100mm} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enimad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. 
 There is a tiny hiccup: in order to adjust the horizontal position of the TO address, I need to modify the variable toaddrhpos. In nomal LaTex file, I can do this with: \setplength{toaddrhpos}{-100mm} to move the addressee field 100mm to the left. I tested this in normal .tex file and it works. How do I set it in an Org file? As you can see, I tried to put that field in the #+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA, it doesnt work. I also tried to put it in #+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA and it doesnt work. Last but not least, I also tried to just write out \setplength{toaddrhpos}{-100mm}, and still it doesnt work. How do I go about to set this variable?

I understand the old org archive is deprecated and org-contrib is getting its own repo, but slimhtml isn&#x27;t in https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/ either. Is there another place where this is getting moved or is the only option to clone the git repo?

                    <span>Hi I&#x27;m working part-time, studying and I&#x27;m a TA as well. My schedule is pretty hectic, I want to learn other people&#x27;s workflow who are in a similar boat, so I can replicate it.
 Thanks.

                    <span>I am deploying a React app on Firebase. While I like how easy Firebase has made it to build SaaS apps (auth is huge, as is ease of deployment) I f**king hate JS, and TS. It feels so janky to code in.
 I&#x27;d really like to be able to do this in Scala, but my skills in Scala.JS and Firebase are too humble to figure this out from scratch given how fast I want to iterate on this app. I Googled for an example project but couldn&#x27;t find one. The Scala.JS website suggests it should be quite possible.
 Have you built/have a working example of a Scala.JS app that uses the Firebase SDK?

                    <span>Hi, I have read that there is embedded the Google Cloud Connector within any dataproc instance, but I don&#x27;t really can find how can I access a file that is in a specific bucket. Isn&#x27;t there any easy way to read that file within the Scala code? Should I use the Java library to use the gcs sdk?
 Thank you in advance, I&#x27;d appreciate any help!

                    <span>Hi everyone
 Is there a way of doing an interactive tangling with orgmode? What I want is to place a specific string in a code block and then have org ask with what to place the string with when tangling the file.
 I looked in the babel manual but found nothing of the sort.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Mohsin Kaleem has just released consult-bibtex. It is a consult/completing-read interface for bibtex-completion, very similar to ivy-bibtex or helm-bibtex. Right now, it&#x27;s just on github.

                    <span>Hi,
 I use timeblocking to plan my days one week at a time. I used to use thunderbird, and with the lightning extension I got a very clear, graphical interface for planning out my week (synced using a google calendar) and adjusting the time-blocks dynamically during the week.
 I recently moved to mu4e and in terms of emails, it is absolutely and utterly fantastic. However, I have not been able to find a good planning replacement. I know and use org-gcal which is very good in terms of syncing with google calendar. However, I really miss the ease with which I could view my time-blocks. org-gcal has a weekly view mode, but it does not have any way of showing &#x27;blocks&#x27; of time - every event is just a single line (which often doesn&#x27;t fit in the column).
 I know the emacs universe is too vast for any one person to know and try all the packages. So, I would like to ask for tips and suggestions from people on here. If you time-block using emacs and would like to share how you go about doing it, I&#x27;d be very interested to know.
 Cheers

I also want to make my .emacs.d more portable and have all the packages I used installed manually so I can take it with me wherever I go.

 but when I reload my init.el file I get this error
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Wrong type argument: stringp, expand-region

 Does anyone know what this means?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am a Doom Emacs user and in my Emacs, company-mode is installed, which results on autocompletion showing during every text that I write, usually Markdown and Orgmode files. Nice! Looks usefull.
 Is there any way to change the completion setting of company-mode to support the Dutch language?

                    <span>I just read through part of the transcript of the latest podcast[1] of Haskell Weekly, &quot;Dependent types with Vladislav Zavialov&quot;, until they were (I think) done talking about sigma and pi types. Still confused, I bounced to Wikipedia[2]. At this point I think I understand what they are, and how they differ.
 Suppose A is a type in some collection of types U, and B is a type family from A to U. That is, an input to B is some member of the type A, and an output from B is an entire type from U. Then:
 (1) Sigma [x:A] B(x) is the collection of pairs (x,y) for x:A and y:B(x).
 (2) Pi [x:A] B(x) is the collection of function-like things mapping every input x:A to some y:B(x).
 (3) Therefore, every element of a pi type can be seen as a cross section of the corresponding sigma type.
 If (3) is correct, then the title of this post is wrong -- the title suggests that the pi type itself, rather than each of its members, is a cross section of the corresponding sigma type.
 Have I understood?

                    <span>I have been reading about Expression Problem, and I found this comment on r/haskell, which leads to this online discussion, where the main idea is following:
  
a widely known Haskell solution to the expression problem, is to lift all constructors to the type level, and use type classes to implement cases where you&#x27;d normally use pattern matching. The solution presented in this paper essentially makes this the canonical method of pattern matching, ie. pattern matching is reduced to dictionary dispatch. The connections to OO vtables is obvious I hope.
  
I decided to give it a try and implement a simple interpreter that doesn&#x27;t have an Expression Problem (which means that both types and operations can be added without modifying existing code).
 This is a simple implementation I started with…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ll give a quick example of what I am talking about, first.
 You have a product type:
  data MyProduct &#x3D; MyProduct { productFoo :: Foo , productBar :: Bar , productBaz :: Baz } 
 and some way to isolate each &quot;piece&quot; of that product type:
  data SomePiece &#x3D; PieceFoo Foo | PieceBar Bar | PieceBaz Baz 
 With this example in mind, imagine you have a (possibly infinite) list of SomePiece, and you would like to construct a MyProduct as soon as possible. Perhaps, this means that whenever you encounter a piece in your list, you hold onto it and ignore future pieces of that type, or you possibly drop the old piece in favor of the new piece of the same type, or perform some kind of combining function on the pieces. Whenever you have all the pieces needed to construct a MyProduct, you do so and stop pulling off the list.
 Of course, you also have to take into account the possibility that the list terminates before we receive all the required pieces, so we wrap the return type in Maybe:
  constructMyProduct :: [SomePiece] -&gt; Maybe MyProduct constructMyProduct &#x3D; undefined 
 What are some good solutions to this problem? Are there any general solutions, that will work for other product types with different numbers of arguments? A library or portion of a library that focuses on this would be ideal.

                    <span>Hi everyone! We got back to working on &quot;Magical Haskell&quot; book, finished the first 5 chapters (about 5 more are coming up), and would very much appreciate the feedback of the community.
 The book has a goal of teaching Haskell gently, using lots of visuals and pictures, but from the first principles - so NO imperative patterns, but functional thinking, Types, building up powerful abstractions naturally to develop intuition. We have by now invented a Functor as well as a Bifunctor, Applicative and Monad are coming up :)
 The book is available here: https://leanpub.com/magicalhaskell
 Any feedback / comments / suggestions are highly appreciated!

                    <span>Is this book still a good intro to parallel and concurrency in Haskell? Are there any notable supplementary resources for the topic?
 I ask because I myself am trying to design an application that needs to be heavily concurrent (e.g., scanning client emails to do text analysis for malicious content) and the concurrent section of the book seems to be a nice survey of the various strategies (like STM or actor).

I got every recommendation the terminal suggested, but now it has informed that there are a same package name being used in multiple local packages.
 i&#x27;ve detailed better my situation here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68946922/trying-to-install-hlint-by-stack-got-same-package-name-error

                    <span>I have been learning Haskell for about a month now. It is a wonderful language. I am constantly surprised at how simple it is, once you&#x27;ve wrapped your head around evaluation, algebras, and higher-order functions. The more I learn, the more I am aghast at how messy the OOP paradigm can be. Haskell has types and typeclasses, and that&#x27;s it! No need for interfaces, sub/super classes, constructors, scoped variables, none of that stuff.
 I love Haskell!

After a few days I missed a day... Now when I complete the habit for the day and rebuild the agenda view, it&#x27;s still showing as TODO for today... Is this expected behavior? Is it expecting me to complete the habit 2x in one day to make up for the missed day?
 Confused. Any help appreciated.

                    <span>If I wanted to define a type Foo such that Foo is really an Int with values expected within a range - is there a way to do this without needing to wrap the value (and instead behave more like a primitive type)?
 So instead of:
 val x &#x3D; Foo(value&#x3D;20) if (x.value &gt; 10) ... 
 You could instead do:
 val x: Foo &#x3D; 20 if (x &gt; 10) ... 
 and so on.

                    <span>Imagine you&#x27;re constructing &amp; returning Seq[T] without knowledge of how it&#x27;ll be used. 
 Should you internally use List (via List.newBuilder), Vector (via Vector.newBuilder), or another data type to construct the Seq?

                    <span>Daily ICFP
Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 4 - Thursday
These notes follow Noon and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order. (The talks are not publicly posted at the time
of publication of this post, but we expect they will be over the
coming weeks.)
Noon — Second to last day of ICFP. I’m becoming sad that it’s
going to be over! But that said, I’m really looking forward to today!
I feel a bit relaxed as well, because from my timezone (UK) I get a bit
of a break in the morning (as I’m starting my day at the Haskell track.)

                    <span>Hello everybody!
I am a musicologist who have been reading the blog- and forumposts for some years now. 
I use plain text and search
I don´t agree with the notion of a &quot;second brain&quot;, but lean more towards the notion of a &quot;extended mind&quot;.
Thank you for all your insights and looking forward to take part in the discussions! 
And to bother you with some of my own questions and ideas.</span>

                    <span>The org mode has the fantastic latex preview function, which I have used a lot. Now I want some diagrams drawn by Metapost, which requires run LaTeX twice. The default setting obviously does not do this. Is there a way that I can make org-preview run latex twice in a certain file?

                    <span>Can vterm be used for remote work that tracks the emacs pwd (Present Working Directory) like Better Shell? Better-Shell keeps the directory in lockstep with my emacs work and navigation, so if, for example, I cd in the shell to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ then I can immediately find-file to somesite.conf, even when I&#x27;m SUDO. 
 I want to be able to do, eg, a C-f or C-d that will open to the current remote place as context. I know there are plenty of happy vterm users here, and I am trying to make the jump. The speed advantages are obvious, but at the moment I am still relatively handicapped on remote servers where I miss the emacs interop. Any tips?

                    <span>Edit: I now see my title maybe isn&#x27;t clear. The emphasis is on you, I&#x27;d like to hear how you make presentations.
 My go-to way of making presentations right now is Org-mode exporting to Beamer. Howerver, I do like to mess with commands like pause, onslide, only, and alert which just is a big pain to do in Org-mode. I have come to the point that if a slide is even remotely complex I just only write the heading in Org-mode itself and then BEGIN_EXPORT latex the rest inside latex. It works, but it is far from ideal. For example, setting up columns in Org-mode is really cumbersome.
 Anything that works better? I need the Tex Math, but any other tool that can render my Tex equations would be nice. The only thing I really miss about WYSIWYG editing like powerpoint is adding annotations such as arrows; it is just a big pain having to define these coordinates vs the drag and drop.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve just started using emacs with systemd (so using the client/server system) but for some reason this is not setting the font properly. The relevant part of my init.el is
 (set-face-font &#x60;default &quot;Jetbrains Mono-16&quot;) (set-face-font &#x60;variable-pitch &quot;Cantarell-16&quot;) (copy-face &#x60;default &#x60;fixed-pitch) 
 It does work fine though when launching with emacs
 I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s something to do with emacs not loading fonts until the first frame appears, but I have no idea how to wait for the first frame to set it.
 Anyone know how to do this? (I&#x27;m also quite new to emacs lisp, I recently moved from neovim)

 This case doesn&#x27;t happened when use emacs in terminal.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a teacher and I want to explain the superiority of typed Haskell over, say, C++. C++ has structures, has enumerated things, has, above all, objects. Let&#x27;s say for example we want to model the standard astronomical measurement for a star in the sky. It&#x27;s made up of two parts, i.e., a right ascension α and a declination δ. How could I create a Haskell type for a star location out of these two? How would it be preferable to anything C++ might do, object or structure-wise? And how could I build in the allowable angle ranges of 0 ≤ α ≤ 360 ◦ and −90 ◦ ≤ δ ≤ 90 ◦ respectively. In SQL I can restrict a field to certain allowed values, ranges. How to do this in Haskell? So my audience is a math class that has heard of C++ but not Haskell and is thinking of a language for numerical analysis of, say, Calculus.

                    <span>Sometimes the granularity of deriving is too coarse, and there is a need to tweak it at the finer level. A uniform instance like this can be derived
 data T &#x3D; T String String String String (IO ()) instance Semigroup T where () :: T -&gt; T -&gt; T T a b c d io  T a1 b1 c1 d1 io1 &#x3D; T (a  a1) (b  b1) (c  c1) (d  d1) (io  io1) instance Monoid T where mempty :: T mempty &#x3D; T mempty mempty mempty mempty mempty 
 using the new Generically modifier from GHC.Generics because every field is processed the same with 
 data T &#x3D; T String String String String (IO ()) deriving stock Generic deriving (Semigroup, Monoid) via Generically T 
 But it&#x27;s annoying when even a single field is processed differently, with liftA2 () or + that we can no longer derive it.

                    <span>This seems like something that should be easy but I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to do it.
 I have a heading, with a subheading inside it that has some text. I would like then to add more text but at the level of the first heading and not the second but I can&#x27;t find how to get the text to be considered part of the parent heading without adding a new top level header. 
 The source file looks something like:
 * Heading Paragraph of heading level. ** Subheading Paragraph of subheader text. Paragraph that I want at Heading level but is at subheading level. 
 How can I tell org mode that the last paragraph isn&#x27;t under subheading but is in fact under heading again or are you stuck inside a bullet list until you add a new heading to get you out?

                    <span>Got to a point where I am just utterly demotivated and actually afraid to do anything new, anything that doesn&#x27;t just copy something that&#x27;s already in code. And even that might not prevent the shenanigans. This is not fun at all, although scala itself would be. And for what, spending 2x as much time in peer review than in development, making zero progress that would actually move my employer forward?
 I&#x27;m really tired of it. It&#x27;s not even nitpicking, not like pointing out typos, more like
 &quot;I don&#x27;t like this, I like my version better, therefore go spend an hour redoing it. Multiply by number of team members and code length / complexity times some factor f.
 Like it wasn&#x27;t good enough in its original version. It&#x27;s not like I put a var in. It&#x27;s not like I broke referential transparency so you have to make it a showstopper. So I used a feature more heavily than you&#x27;d like. I still like it, how about you mind your own buiness? So I didn&#x27;t use this technique you like, so what? So I used a technique you disliked, so what? Etc.
 Maybe I would put up with it if metrics by which I&#x27;m judged would have anything to do with code quality, but even then, at some point actually getting things done would be nice.
 Is it like this everywhere? Or in all more functionally oriented teams? It sucks so much I&#x27;m considering leaving the language because of this. I&#x27;ve seen other stuff, I know it doesn&#x27;t have to be like this (even if you have garden variety nitpickers and similar team members everywhere, but it&#x27;s usually not this pervasive). Using typeclasses and all the other cool stuff is very cool indeed, but not really worth it if I have to put up with this.

                    <span>I defined the following trait in Scala 3
 trait A[T  false // I don&#x27;t want nothing to be in T case &#x27;[head *: tail] if TypeRepr.of[head]  allSubtypesOfB[tail] case &#x27;[EmptyTuple] &#x3D;&gt; true case _ &#x3D;&gt; false } inline def createA[T  doSomethingWithBSubtype[head] case &#x27;[EmptyTuple] &#x3D;&gt; ??? } // ... create instance of A } 
 This code won&#x27;t compile as the compiler says that head must be a subtype of B to be used in the method doSomethingWithBSubtype. However, with the if preceding the match case I already ensured that all types inside T are subtypes of B. Is there a way to force the compiler to recognise head as a subtype of B?

                    <span>My play framework project flow looks something like this:
 router
 GET /person/:height controllers.ViewController.person(height: Int)
 controllers.ViewController.person
  
def person(height: Int): EssentialAction &#x3D; cached.apply(req &#x3D;&gt; req.path, cacheDuration) {withoutLoginAction { implicit loginState &#x3D;&gt;implicit request &#x3D;&gt;Ok(views.html.person(Option(height)))}}
  
And then it goes to the HTML file which renders the page.I want to be able to go back and forth using the buttons on the back and forward buttons on the browser. What should be the approach and what are possible solutions? I am just stuck on it and all Scala play tutorials are manually changing the URI so I do not know how to utilise the back/front button.
 Edit: I am trying to debug a project and learning scala/play as I go. I am having this issue and just do not understand on why I am having it. I am looking for an approach on how do you get your scala project to be compatible/work with the back/forward buttons.
 How to I load the cached version of the page through back button?
 Edit 2: Adding more info
 ​
 What is happening:
 URI: http://localhost:9000/person/height/78478
 ​
 On clicking back URI changes to
 &gt; URI: http://localhost:9000/person/height
 But the webpage remains same.
 ​
 On clicking back again:
 &gt; URI: http://localhost:9000
 But webpage is still same.
 ​
 On clicking forward:
 &gt; URI: http://localhost:9000/person/height
 and webpage is still same
 Here is how it looks

                    <span>Daily ICFP
Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 3 - Wednesday
These notes follow Noon, Arnaud, and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order.
Noon — On Continuation-Passing Transformations and Expected Cost Analysis
Discussion of the difficulty of costing probabilistic algorithms (i.e. you don’t know what it will do.)
Turns out using continuations makes it a bit easier to reason about (I didn’t quite follow the trick that makes it true),
But, it gives a way to think compute average-cost analysis, which seems pretty useful!
Noon — Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis with the Quantum Physicist’s Method
Quantum physics? I’m interested.

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious if anyone has experience with a dual-zettelkasten format.  So far, it hasn&#x27;t caused any (major) problems.
If I write a &quot;good&quot; zettle diligently and feel too lazy to rewrite the full note in digital form, particularly a note with lots of diagrams (mathematics, etc) I&#x27;ll resort to the following...
Workflow: Physical to Digital
Scan the zettle making sure its readable
Create a zettle with the same id and title in digital form
Insert the scan as a large image
Write the header in digital form (using a physical-scan-template) this is quick
Write any links in digital form
Write a one-sentence summary in digital form.
Liberally use NON-hashed tags for keywords in the scanned text for easy searching.
Keep the physical copy and add to physical slipbox
At some point, if I get around to it, I will slowly convert notes that have been post-semi-digitized per the above into purely digital form.
I find the above most helpful when doing mathematics: the diagrams of category theory can take lots of time to write in latex. So if you have a particularly well-formed note with lots of notation, then I&#x27;ve found this method can work out fine in the short-term.  The most important items -- by trial and error -- from above are 5 6 and 7 so as to preserve the ability to search, link, and see a short summary.
Workflow: Digital to Physical (perhaps this is a bit obsessive)
At the end of each day collect the digitally created zettels from that day (easy with timestamp ID)
Print them out 2-per page and cut in half
Add to physical slipbox
Always maintain a printed copy of any index or structure notes.
Now you have a synchronized digital and physical slipbox. Its not perfect but sometimes the good enough, is.</span>

                    <span>As many of you know I am new to Zettelkasten.
I&#x27;m curious how the interplay between sparing use of folders and &quot;types&quot; (a finite small set of tags on the form) -- for example, when taking notes on a book I consider this a buffer note (I use the haskell type syntax ::buffer ) and place it in my /fleeting notes folder. Fleeting contains anything from ::buffer notes to extracted highlights, to temporary documents etc.
This might become a ::literature note if the ideas in the ::buffer note are reworked to be my own (personal reactions -- things it reminds me of etc)
Finally a literature note becomes ::permanent (and goes in the /zettelkasten folder) when I have massaged it (into one or more) atomic, conceptual, not directly derivative -- but still, of course, referenced and possibly linked to …</span>

                    <span>So I use The Archive + Dropbox for everything (Plus 1Writer for iOS).
Does anyone know a creative way to get &quot;Hey Siri&quot; to create a note for me?
I know iOS Shortcuts can create the note in 1Writer, but I still have to type the content.
I&#x27;d like a hands-free way to use Siri while driving to add a text file with &quot;#inbox&quot; directly to my Zettelkasten folder in Dropbox.
I know Drafts lets me export TO Dropbox, but I&#x27;d love a way for it to show up right there in one step, similar to how I can create a note in the Apple Notes app directly from Siri.
I use Keyboard Maestro, if that&#x27;s helpful.
Any ideas?</span>

                    <span>I program in c++ in emacs with a bunch of custom font-lock/prettify-symbols mode customizations that let me basically do what is called &quot;literate programming&quot; in emacs. Basically, attractive formatted text mingled with actual code that compiles. This is mainly accomplished by a set of special commenting conventions that control fonts and whether the c++ &quot;//&quot; comment characters are displayed or the comments are just shown as bare text. I also have markup in comments and mathematical symbol display in unicode. 
 ​
 The code looks pretty normal if you just display it as text or are using an IDE without my customizations.
 This works and looks great. The only problem is the only way I can share the results are through screenshots or if someone is running emacs with the same customizations. But…</span>

                    <span>Hi,
 I want to modify the modeline to display only what I need: the buffer name, the point line and column number and the number of characters and lines in the region when it is active. I am using evil.
 From what I understood, the default modeline can provide the buffer name and the point line and column number. If I want the number of characters and lines in a region, modeline-posn.el is one of the solutions.
  
My 1st problem is that when I use modeline-posn.el, it looks like (setq column-number-indicator-zero-based nil) is not taken into account anymore. Indeed, when I put the point in the 1st column, I expect to see in the modeline that the point is in column 1 but I see 0.
 
My second problem (I do not know if it is related to the 1st one) is that when I enter the evil visual state, …</span>

                    <span>Hi, I would like to increase the amount of indentation when I&#x27;m coding by 1.5-2x, or something along those lines. Actually setting the indentation width to more space characters would make all formatters and other programmers upset. I also think that formatting according to my preference on file open, then formatting back to the default on commit, could lead to unwanted whitespace changes and, again, make other programmers upset. Is there a way to fake increase the indentation width? I use spaces, so is there a way to only increase the width of spaces when I&#x27;m coding, that is efficient enough to deal with the large number of spaces that tend to exist in most files?

                    <span>Hi there! 
 I&#x27;m currently using Emacs 27.2 with built-in Org mode (9.4.4) and so far, I am quite satisfied with my patch-work org citation solution. And yes, that is without using the newly introduced org cite framework **exited NPC noises** (see tecosaur&#x27;s July digest).
 Currently my setup (simplified for the sake of argument) involves the addition of a org-link-parameter:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-link-parameters &#x27;(&quot;cite&quot; :follow embark-act)) 
 and following B. D&#x27;Arcus&#x27; suggested bibtex-actions configuration I add an action-keymap pair to embark:
 (add-to-list &#x27;embark-keymap-alist &#x27;(bib-reference . bibtex-actions-map)) 
 BUT, since this is not Org 9.5 with all its&#x27; tremendous linking support, I am not able to connect my custom org-link parameter to the embark action, which is unfortunate...
 I have tried it with the :keymap keyword (in org-link-parameters), but I think I&#x27;m at the wrong place. I guess I&#x27;ll have to extend the :follow part, but somehow I have difficulties to connect the dots.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated and let me know if you need more information!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to call (transient-define-infix) with a generated name, but I&#x27;m stuck because my elisp macro fu is weak.
 What I&#x27;m trying to do is something like this: (transient-define-infix (intern &quot;cc/test-infix-name&quot;) ()), but that results in the error progn: Wrong type argument: symbolp, (intern &quot;cc/test-infix-name&quot;). I&#x27;ve tried a few different quoting variations and can&#x27;t figure it out, and at this point I&#x27;m not even sure that it&#x27;s possible.
 Doing (defalias (intern &quot;cc/test-generate-foo&quot;) &#x27;cc/test-foo) works, so I assume the issue is with quoting/evaluation within the transient-define-infix macro. Here&#x27;s the implementation of that:

                    <span>Hey folks, some of you may remember my original post about valida. I decided to just pull in the profunctors dependency and instance it instead of homerolling a specialized version of contravariance. Check it out on github!
 The API now has more composition potential since everything is done with just a profunctorial applicative validator! Here&#x27;s a small example (with totally made up data types and validation scenarios!)-

                    <span>I have had a realisation.
 For the OO programmer, one can think of monads as a general case of optional chaining.
 This may be a mathematical over-simplification, however, it&#x27;s an easy way to think of monads.
 Like optionals in swift:
  if let johnsStreet &#x3D; john.residence?.address?.street { print(&quot;John&#x27;s street name is \(johnsStreet).&quot;) } else { print(&quot;Unable to retrieve the address.&quot;) } // Prints &quot;Unable to retrieve the address.&quot; 
 Just 20 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; half &gt;&gt;&#x3D; half &gt;&gt;&#x3D; half ... Nothing 
 I guess the extra piece is that monads allow one to specify specific rules for &quot;progress&quot; to continue rather than just being nil/nothing, but its pretty close right?
 Whatcha think?

                    <span>There must be a name for this (or this kind of) operation or even a generalization of it. But I can&#x27;t find anything in Hoogle.
 I would expect some kind of zipWith that also works on list of lists.

                    <span>I use vars in source blocks all the time. 
 Here&#x27;s a trivial example:
 #+name: words #+begin_example json {&quot;words&quot;: [&quot;Mauris&quot;, &quot;felis&quot;, &quot;velit&quot;, &quot;tristique&quot;, &quot;imperdiet&quot;]} #+end_example #+begin_src http :var data&#x3D;words POST http://localhost:3000/process-words Content-Type: application/json ${data} #+end_src 
 Now, I can&#x27;t figure out two things:
 1) How can I chain the data through multiple blocks? e.g.:
 #+name: names #+begin_example json [&quot;David&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Stephen&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;] #+end_example #+name: words_and_names #+begin_example json :var names-data&#x3D;names {&quot;words&quot;: [&quot;Mauris&quot;, &quot;felis&quot;, &quot;velit&quot;, &quot;tristique&quot;, &quot;imperdiet&quot;], &quot;names&quot;: ${names-data}} #+end_example #+begin_src sh :var data&#x3D;words_and_names :results verbatim echo ${data} #+end_src #+RESULTS: : {&quot;words&quot;: [&quot;Mauris&quot;, &quot;felis&quot;, &quot;velit&quot;, &quot;tristique&quot;, &quot;imperdiet&quot;], &quot;names&quot;: ${names-data}} 
 As you can see, that sadly doesn&#x27;t work. Is that even possible?
 2) Also, is it possible to load something into a var from a file, instead of another block?

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m slowly building new version control service for selfhosting called libreforge, in style of gitea sourcehut etc. but built from microservices where user can e.g. completely disable pull requests, issues and other parts in his instance. Here I&#x27;m comming to listen opionions and suggestions about frameworks and tools, should I use something like chaos or logom? or is there something better? I want it to be only backend where user has free hand to easly create his own frontend in whatever language/framework he wants.

                    <span>Hey I&#x27;m new to Scala and have been teaching myself the last couple weeks and just had some questions about Scala 3. I really like the new syntax of the language but had issues with the compiler and just generally find it difficult to create new projects and build new things. It felt like to me that Scala 2 was just much easier to build things in. Do other share this same feeling or are there maybe tips or tricks I could use to make the whole process easier. I am working on a macbook btw. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Daily ICFP
Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 2 - Tuesday
These notes follow Noon, Arnaud, and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order.
Richard — Watched the video for Symbolic and Automatic Differentiation
of
Languages,
by Conal Elliott. Conal’s papers and talks are always
very insightful — because they are always very simple. Conal has a
remarkable knack for taking problems that seem complex and reducing them to
their essence — often, a simple compositional language. This work fits very
much in this vein, describing how we can derive parsers for a language
straight from its definition. The talk is gentle and mind-blowing all at the

                    <span>Hi all,
 I just made the first bit of personal config of emacs that I am a bit proud of (I jhave just taken up emacs quite recently). Happy to take any comment about it :)

                    <span>I&#x27;m writing a package for interacting with emacs-w3m with ivy. I want functions like ivy-w3m-switch-buffer to inherit the settings -- especially the actions -- of their standard counterparts, so that for example ivy-w3m-switch-buffer should have the same actions available as ivy-switch-buffer does (or perhaps counsel-switch-buffer).
 This is for two reasons:
  
Don&#x27;t duplicate code! The vast majority of the two functions will be the same, better to inherit if possible (and track/inherit bug fixes and improvements as they come along) than to write it twice.
 If the user has defined their own specific settings for the parent function -- like a custom action for ivy-switch-buffer, they shouldn&#x27;t have to add them again to the new function. User shouldn&#x27;t have to duplicate either.
  
Is there a standard way to do this? Or perhaps just a standard way of getting these settings for a given function, so that I could just interpolate them into my definition of the new one?
 TIA!

                    <span>For example, C-x C-; (comment-line) works perfectly fine when using emacs insdie xterm/uxterm, but not inside any other terminal I have tried (gnome-terminal, rxvt, kitty etc). In all of the others, emacs seems to think that I&#x27;m pressing C-x ; instead.
 Do you guys understand why this happens? This tends to annoy me a bit on the rare occasion that I have to use emacs inside a terminal since many of the shortcuts I am habituated to aren&#x27;t available.
 My guess is that xterm sends extra escape codes that other terminals that emacs is able to detect and support, but I would love to know if someone knows for sure. Also, do you know of other terminals that have these extra xterm capabilities (perhaps hidden under some settings)?

 But many times I&#x27;ve heard stories about pinky finger and carpal tunnel damage in the long run, and this is something I&#x27;d like to avoid if I can help it
 Is it possible (and worth it) to use emacs without whatever it is that seems to ruin people&#x27;s wrists with time as they use it?
 (And as a bonus, for anyone out there who has used both vim and emacs, is there anything that I would miss coming from vim if I use emacs with evil mode?)

                    <span>Hi, im learning emacs and trying to adopt it as my file manager. so im trying dired.
 I would like to have a single key or keybind to :
 Open images in another frame without losing focus (Like C-o)
 Play music files (.mp3 .wav) in a simple way, I am not looking for a complex player nor a way to organize my music, i just want to play the mp3 file to look what it is.
 Open .mp4 files with vlc, pdf&#x27;s with evince, .ggb with geogebra, .xfc with gimp, etc.
 Is there a way to achieve this? Like a master Key/keybind to open all things

                    <span>This is my entire config, except for stuff to set up the package library and install use-package (full config here).
 (defun test-func () (interactive) (message &quot;my func&quot;)) (use-package evil :init (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t) :config (evil-mode)) (use-package general :config (general-override-mode 1) (general-evil-setup t)) (use-package evil-collection :after evil :config (evil-collection-init) (setq evil-collection-setup-minibuffer t)) ;;1 (use-package counsel) ;;2 (use-package dired :ensure nil :general (:states &#x27;normal :keymaps &#x27;dired-mode-map &quot;j&quot; &#x27;test-func)) 
 As-is, when I open dired (C-x d), hitting &quot;j&quot; will call test-func. However, if I switch blocks 1 and 2 so that dired comes first and counsel comes second, &quot;j&quot; will instead call evil-next-line. Why does this happen?
 Edit: After not being able to reproduce this with other packages, I looked in counsel&#x27;s code and found that it does a require for dired. Replacing (use-package counsel) with (require &#x27;dired) also worked - but why? Shouldn&#x27;t my use of use-package and general already load dired and define keybindings? Why do my bindings get overwritten if I don&#x27;t require dired before its use-package block?

                    <span>I have a small question best illustrated by this self-documented org-mode snippet:
 - I&#x27;ve started a list in org-mode. I pressed RET to make a newline within the current item. - I pressed M-RET to create a new item. Now I&#x27;m done with the list. What do I do to exit the list and go on writing something else? (C-o C-n would work but be damned if there isn&#x27;t a single combo for this ...) 
 Couldn&#x27;t find the answer in the docs.
 Edit: The described behavior of RET - creating a new indented line when list item is at point - was added recently. I&#x27;m currently experiencing it in org-mode 9.4.6 - and I was just surprised that there&#x27;s no intuitive way to make a newline that&#x27;s neither indented nor a new list item.

                    <span>I just upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1 (using GUIX) and now all the dailies functions are missing.
 I found 
  
(define-obsolete-function-alias 
 &#x27;org-roam-dailies-find-today 
 &#x27;org-roam-dailies-goto-today &quot;org-roam 2.0&quot;)
  
But I can&#x27;t find any mention of dailies being removed in the release notes. Dailies are still in the manual as well. They were working fine in version 2.0. 
 Why were they removed? 
 This was part of my daily workflow. Any suggestions for how to get capture to at least roughly replicate the way dailies worked?

 Is there a way to do this in Org-mode? I&#x27;ve had a look around but I can&#x27;t seem to find anyone with the same problem.
 The second table in this part of the Wikipedia article seems to suggest that this isn&#x27;t possible.

                    <span>Obviously in most cases it is necessary or desirable to call up embark-act before you execute an Embark command. However, there are some commands I want to use so frequently (e.g., pulling up Help documentation for a command I’m considering using under M-x) that I want to have a dedicated keybinding to execute the Embark action on the selected target without having to pull up the Embark menu first. So in my example, I would hit a keybinding that immediately brings up the Help doc for the selected M-x candidate while still keeping the minibuffer open (instead of having to first press embark-act-noquit and then h to send describe-symbol).
 Maybe this is a question specifically for u/oantolin, but I’m not entirely sure how to go about programming this after reading through the Embark wiki. Is it possible to do in a simple manner?

                    <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell and asking myself how to solve the following problem. I have a simple data structre like this: 
 data Document &#x3D; Document { title :: String, content :: [String], wordCount :: Int } 
 I want to have besides the default constructor where I have to provide a title and the content another one where I just have to provide the title and the content or just the title. And I also want to have a constructor function that creates out of a completely different data structure a Document. 
 I find it pretty nasty to name all these constructor functions differently. Especially since I encountered this problem with a lot of different data structures. So I decided to use ad-hoc polymorphism provided by a generic type-class: 
 class Factory a b where create :: a -&gt; b 
 Which I use like this: 
 instance Factory String ([String] -&gt; Document) where create title words &#x3D; Document { title &#x3D; title, words &#x3D; words, wordCount &#x3D; 0 } instance Factory String Document where create title &#x3D; Document { title &#x3D; title, words &#x3D; [], wordCount &#x3D; 0 } instance Factory RawDocument Document where create RawDocument{..} &#x3D; create title (splitOn &quot; &quot; content) 
 Now I can use simply the create function everywhere with the defined input types. And it scales nicely with all my data structures. 
 Do you see any problems with this approach? I&#x27;m really not sure if I&#x27;m missing something. 
 I&#x27;m just facing one problem:
 - Either I define the factories in the same module as the data structure, but then I need to live with the name shadowing warnings for values like title and words (I would hate to name them differently since they describe the same thing)
 - Or I have a separate Factory-Module but then I have to live with the orphan instance warnings. Which is also pretty nasty 
 What do you recommend?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a hobby programmer doing only very simple work in Ruby, where literally everything is an object. You might be able to imagine that I struggle a bit with wrapping my mind around Haskell. I&#x27;d appreciate it if someone could tell me how the following would be approached in idiomatic Haskell.
 I want to check data for a bunch of conditions, collect the met conditions in a list, and once everything is done, I want them to be output to the console one by one. In Ruby I do it like this, pound sign is comments:
 # Here&#x27;d be a bunch of variables, mostly true/false toggles for storing states relevant to multiple conditions, and a map (i.e. a key-value list) which serves as storage for input data met_conditions &#x3D; [] if [some condition] met_conditions &lt;&lt; &quot;name of the condition&quot; # Append string to list end # This repeats two dozen time with pretty complex if-trees met_conditions.each {|i| puts i} # Print each item individually with newline 
 Cheers for sending me on the right path.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a Haskell novice.
 In another language, I might often use an enum to represent some class of objects (let&#x27;s say types of fruit for sake of argument), then work with arrays of that enum type. I&#x27;m writing a depth-first search for a single-player puzzle game and I&#x27;d like to encode the types of squares on a board in this way, but I&#x27;d also like to use unboxed arrays for the performance. Is it possible (with reasonable simplicity) to add an instance of UArray for a simple sum type like data Fruit &#x3D; Apple | Orange | ..., or am I stuck working with an undesirable layer of translation from a primitive type to my abstracted representation?

 I&#x27;m currently a senior software engineer using .NET, so OOP is my specialty. I&#x27;ve read about and implemented SOLID, Design Patterns, some DDD in my applications; mostly working in implementing Web APIs.
 This is what I pride myself with, the back-end. As I&#x27;m technically a full stack dev with Angular but I&#x27;m not that much into the front-end past writing services/components.
 After discovering cryptocurrencies, in particular Cardano, and seeing what amount of brainpower goes into developing such a ecosystem I&#x27;ve deep-dived into Haskell.
 I&#x27;ve read &quot;Haskell Programming from first principles&quot;, and I found it brilliant. I&#x27;ve also skimmed through the other beginner books, i.e. &quot;Programming in Haskell&quot;, &quot;Real World Haskell&quot; etc.

                    <span>Looking for advice on some Hakyll customization.
 I have a Hakyll site that includes .lhs files. I&#x27;m trying to insert links from my pandoc-compiled lhs pages to the raw lhs. The natural way to do that is to have a context field that gives the URL to the raw version.
 To accomplish that, I thought it would be good to define a new type of field. I was aiming for something like urlField. Here&#x27;s what I ended up with, which is working:
 -- | Create a field that is the URL to the given version of the current item -- or non-existent (suitable for use in @$if(...)$@) if there is no such -- version. versionedUrlField :: String -- ^ version -&gt; String -- ^ key -&gt; Context a versionedUrlField version key &#x3D; field key $ \i -&gt; let empty&#x27; &#x3D; fail $ &quot;Cannot find routed \&quot;&quot; ++ version ++ &quot;\&quot; version for item &quot; ++ show (itemIdentifier i) lhsFilePathCompiler &#x3D; (getUnderlying &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (load . setVersion (Just version) :: Identifier -&gt; Compiler (Item String)) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; getRoute . itemIdentifier) in maybe empty&#x27; toUrl  lhsFilePathCompiler 
 The strange part of this is the explicit type given to load . setVersion (Just version). I&#x27;d like this code to work regardless of how the resource I&#x27;m loading was compiled, but ghci does not seem to be able to give me the appropriate type make this polymorphic, and I&#x27;m not sure what it is, either, if it&#x27;s even feasible.
 Alternatively, I&#x27;m very open to &quot;here&#x27;s a much better way to accomplish the same than your versionedUrlField function&quot; :)
 (If anyone wants to use this as is, feel free. However, if you&#x27;re using a copyFileCompiler or the like for your versioned file, you will either want to change the explicit type above or replace just copyFileCompiler with copyFileCompiler &gt;&gt;&#x3D; getResourceString, both of which feel gross.)
 Thanks!

 import scala.collection class CustomCollection[K, V] { type UnderlyingMap[K, V]  immutable.LongMap[V] case AnyRefK  immutable.AnyRefMap[AnyRefK, V] case _ &#x3D;&gt; immutable.Map[K, V] } ... } val a &#x3D; CustomCollection[Long, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.LongMap[String] val b &#x3D; CustomCollection[String, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.AnyRefMap[String, String] val c &#x3D; CustomCollection[Char, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.Map[Char, String] 
 Is that even possible? How could you do it in Scala 3?

                    <span>Hi All,
 I am planning to use scala refined types to validate JSON configuration files. I was wondering if anyone is using them, and how has been there experience. More specifically, I am concerned about if it adds lots of boiler plate as we are in a much mature stage of application. I tried value classes and new types macros but nothing seems to be as robust/ efficient as refined types for my current work. 
 Thanks

                    <span>I have a large 20K line Scala project, and I was super lucky, just changing the Scala version to 3.0.1 compiled in the first try. Did not have to use any migration scripts.
 I have two questions: 1. Is this kind of simple migration dangerous by potentially changing the meaning of the code? 2. Is there a tool that would beautify code according to the new features - for example, removing the &quot;new&quot; keyword, etc... Or at the very least, is there a list of trivial migrations that everyone should do after Scala 3 migration?

                    <span>Can sb explain to me why this won&#x27;t compile (2.13);
 case class Wrapper[A](a: A, fun: A &#x3D;&gt; String) Seq( Wrapper(&quot;String&quot;, (x: String) &#x3D;&gt; x), Wrapper(1, (x: Int) &#x3D;&gt; x.toString) ).foreach{ w &#x3D;&gt; println(w.fun(w.a)) } 
 But this will;
 trait Wrapper2[A] { type myA &#x3D; A val a: myA def fun(a: myA): String } val s &#x3D; new Wrapper2[String]{ val a &#x3D; &quot;String&quot; def fun(a: myA): String &#x3D; a } val i &#x3D; new Wrapper2[Int]{ val a &#x3D; 1 def fun(a: myA): String &#x3D; a.toString } Seq(s,i).foreach{ w &#x3D;&gt; println(w.fun(w.a)) } 
 In the first case, the A-s are the same and we know that. In the second case, we just know that with extra steps. In both cases the Seq will be a Seq[Wrapper[_&gt;:String with Int]] 
 I wanted to encapsulate the instances with its typeclasses, but this seems super boilerplaty. 
 Also, I totally understand why this won&#x27;t work (but still we should know that we can call the fun with a no matter what &quot;object&quot; is a, the compiler guarded us at the callsite);
 object Wrapper2 { def apply[A](a: A, f: A &#x3D;&gt; String): Wrapper2[A] &#x3D; new Wrapper2[A]{ val a &#x3D; a def fun(a: A): String &#x3D; f } }

                    <span>I am trying to do this leetcode question - https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/ - in scala but my solution is just too slow. It seems just as fast as the imperative solutions so does anyone know why it is performing so poorly and how to speed it up? Ideally, I want to have a purely functional solution using continuations.

Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 1 - Monday
These notes follow Noon, Arnaud, and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order.
Richard — Calculating Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional
Pearl)
Started my day at 6:30am in order to attend the Q&amp;A for Calculating
Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional Pearl), by Mitchell Pickard and
Graham Hutton, of the University of Nottingham. (I watched the video itself
last night.) This is a very cool paper about a technique for deriving a
proved-correct compiler by construction. The main example in the talk was
about compiling a simple expression language to a stack machine. The
correctn…</span>

                    <span>Hello,
 I like using bitmap fonts, they&#x27;re significantly clearer to me, but they&#x27;re generally pretty small. The typing latency in emacs is already pretty poor, but with small fonts it becomes almost unbearable, comparable to working over SSH.
 Originally I thought it was syntax highlighting &amp; other plugins, but if i open emacs in the terminal it runs great... which implies it&#x27;s the font rendering???
 How is the font rendering implemented? Is it possible to write my own, and connect it to emacs running as a server? I have no idea wtf the gui is doing to make it so slow:/

                    <span>I noticed org-agenda has been lagging when I initially invoke org-agenda (or, alternatively, (org-agenda-list &quot;a&quot;)). When I check my buffer list I can see that before the invocation nothing (other than the scratch, et al files) is listed. Post-invocation, I can see every file which is enumerated in my &#x27;(org-agenda-files (list org-dir))).
 Based on the documentation, it states a &quot;view will be created for every file listed in org-agend-files list&quot;. Is a buffer synonymous with a view?
 How might I speed up the agenda invocation? It currently takes 10-15 seconds with, maybe, ~100 files.

                    <span>Hey r/emacs!
 How do I turn off the font-lock mode at point? This is for org-mode files. Basically, I want the italics, links, strong or other decorations to text appear plain text, so they are easily editable, whenever I put cursor on them.
 Is there a good way to do it? Or, is there are better/other way to achieve editing these entities quickly and universally?
 Thanks in advance!
 Update: Thanks to u/gusbrs for pointing out https://github.com/awth13/org-appear
 This works:
  (use-package org-appear :custom (org-appear-autolinks t) (org-appear-submarkers t) :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode))

                    <span>Is there an option to keep all of compile data on ram to avoid using SSD? I read that disk is used for dependencies, so isn’t that just the first compile with recompilation not being ssd dependent? I don’t expect I’ll be building binaries. I’m deciding between buying more ram and SSD.

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I know that this might be a dumb question, as the existence of such a function would be problematic in many applications, however, in my case it might prove to be very useful.
 Is there a function in Haskell such that:
  getDefinition :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; String getDefinition &#x3D; return the program text (or something similar) of the input function 
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi, im learning emacs and org, im not confident yet with variables and stuff, but following guides and reading documentation helped me a lot. however i can&#x27;t find the way to hide the GridTimes wich already have a task, for example:
 main: 7:30-10:30 TASK 1
 8:00...... ----------------
 10:00...... ----------------
 main: 10:30-12:30 TASK 2
 12:00...... ----------------
 14:00...... ----------------
 I want to hide the &quot;8:00 ; 10:00 and 12:30&quot; marks, since these times are filled with TASK1 and TASK2 respectively. How can i achieve this? Also i do would like to view the tasks in &quot;time blocks&quot; if possible. (like google calendar for example)
 Sorry, im not english native and this was pretty difficult to explain. Thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;m just getting started with encrypting my org files and have a use case that I can&#x27;t figure out. I want to archive subheadings from time to time but I want those to remain encrypted.
 How to encrypt gpg_archive files?
 If I have foo.gpg and archive a subheading, it automatically creates foo.gpg_archive. It does not automatically added the # -*- mode:org; epa-file-encrypt-to: (&quot;me@me.com&quot;) -*- header, so I add that. But then I close and reopen foo.gpg_archive and I do not get prompted for a passphrase, as I do with foo.gpg. What do I need to do to encrypt foo.gpg_archive?
 Alternatively, how to exclude :ARCHIVE: tags from being searched?
 I would prefer a solution to the above problem, but if that&#x27;s not possible (I&#x27;m fairly certain it is) I&#x27;d be ok with a solution to excluding headings with an :ARCHIVE: tag from search (I use swiper and evil mode search so preferably both, if they aren&#x27;t the same thing under the hood).

                    <span>I noticed org-agenda has been lagging when I initially invoke org-agenda (or, alternatively, (org-agenda-list &quot;a&quot;)). When I check my buffer list I can see that before the invocation nothing (other than the scratch, et al files) is listed. Post-invocation, I can see every file which is enumerated in my &#x27;(org-agenda-files (list org-dir))).
 Based on the documentation, it states a &quot;view will be created for every file listed in org-agend-files list&quot;. Is a buffer synonymous with a view?
 How might I speed up the agenda invocation? It currently takes 10-15 seconds with, maybe, ~100 files.

                    <span>Dear #Scala, I&#x27;ve created GitHub Action that sets up everything you need for Scala, Scala.js, sbt in a single action: https://github.com/japgolly/setup-everything-scala
 Let me know any other improvements and features missing. I think it&#x27;d be really cool to have a centralised and simple, single action.
 (Actually, it&#x27;d be awesome to put this under the official Scala umbrella like scala/setup-everything-scala and just have an org with a few members to maintain it over time, with me (@japgolly) just being a democratic maintainer.)
 Any FYI &amp; enjoy!

                    <span>Hi peps
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying again to read the famous scala with cats book, and I&#x27;m confused about a point in the introduction. The book talks about
 ​
  
typeclasses - in scala, traits with at least a type argument, such as JsonWriter[A]
 typeclasses instances - concrete, implicit implementations of the above for specific types, e.g. JsonWriter[String]
 Usage of typeclasses - methods that use typeclasses instances as implicit parameters
 Difference between Interface Objects (e.g. Json.toJson(&quot;my string&quot;)) and extension syntax (&quot;my string&quot;.toJson)
  
That much is pretty clear and the examples on point.
 It also says that you don&#x27;t have to define instances for every possible type, but instead those can be constructed by known instances. For example, if you have an instance for A, B and C, and you…</span>

                    <span>My team has expressed considerable discomfort with the use of implicits in Scala and wants to do away with them entirely. I think this is a brute force approach to a very solvable problem because I once found implicits intimidating but I am comfortable with them now.
 What are some ways, courses, training materials, exercises that can help boost comfort of using implicits in Scala?
 Are there alternatives to writing Scala free of implicits? how tenable is it?

                    <span>I know there are ZIO Task, Monix Task, Scala Future, and so on. But putting those things aside, if I want to model task with pattern like [1]. Are there any similar ways of handling this (or pattern) using FP? 
 I understand FP is quite different thought, but I am learning by mapping between concrete examples and FP concepts. Any recommended docs or books that I should read? I read a some info e.g. Applicative[2]. That seems to me a good way to model tasks. But I am not sure about other parts such as task progress, and so on. I could totally go to the wrong direction; therefore I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks

Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 0 - Sunday
These notes follow Noon and Richards ICFP day, roughly in order.
Noon
This is my first day ever at ICFP! I’m just trying to get the hang of
the platform, the topics, what background knowledge I’m expected to have, and
how things are presented.
Noon — Higher-order Programming with Effects and Handlers by Jonathan Immanuel Brachthäuser
First talk I was able to make it to (I slept in…)
Was still waking up when I started watching it, so missed a few of the motivations and key concepts.

                    <span>TLDR: What&#x27;s the easiest way of tracking the value of an org statistics cookie through a git commit tree?
 Background
 I use org-mode and git to track my reading habits. I have a document tree with a heading for each book, and three possible todo states: TBR, Read and DNF. The document is thus structured as follows:
 * Books [X/Y] ** TBR Title 1 ** Read Title 2 ** DNF Title 3 
 The value of X is the count of how many titles below it are marked Read, while the value of Y is the count of how many values are marked either Read or TBR. DNFs don&#x27;t enter into the statistics at all.
 With this document, I sometimes add new books to be read, and when I&#x27;ve read a book, I switch the todo status from TBR to Read. If I try the book and don&#x27;t want to finish for one reason or another, I mark it DNF.
 The document is version controlled, so I can go back and see how the list has changed with time. I thought it might be fun to try and plot how the size of the list of books has changed with time, but I don&#x27;t know how to automatically extract the statistics cookie for each commit.
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>I did this code that allows me to download an elfeed entry as audio or video, but as I am a beginner in elisp I&#x27;d like to see some ideas and advices on how to improve it:
 ; Download entry as a 1080p video in directory defined i.e &quot;~/vids&quot; (defun dl-video () (interactive) (let ((default-directory &quot;/media/offline&quot;)) (async-shell-command (format &quot;youtube-dl --format &#x27;best[height&lt;&#x3D;1080]&#x27; &#x27;%s&#x27;&quot; link)))) ; Download entry as audio in directory defined i.e &quot;~/mux&quot; (defun dl-music () (interactive) (let ((default-directory &quot;~/mux&quot;)) (async-shell-command (format &quot;youtube-dl -x -f bestaudio &#x27;%s&#x27;&quot; link)))) ; Prompt to select the format of the download (defun option () (interactive) (let* ((choices &#x27;((&quot;Video 1080p&quot; . dl-video) (&quot;Music&quot; . dl-music))) (choice (completing-read &quot;Download as: &quot; choices))) (call-interactively (cdr (assoc choice choices))))) ; Main function that copy the entry link and call the prompt function to download (defun elfeed-yt-dl () (interactive) (dolist (entry (elfeed-search-selected)) (when-let* ((link (elfeed-entry-link entry))) (with-temp-buffer (insert link) (clipboard-kill-ring-save (point-min) (point-max)) (option)) ))) 
 And a question too, the youtube-dl command to customize the output has this type of argument 
  -o &quot;%(title)s.%(ext)s&quot; 
 So if I use %s to pick the link variable as string, the code doesn&#x27;t work. Any idea of how could I pick the variable without using %s

                    <span>I needed a change and my friend who has been using Linux, Emacs, and programming languages in his work for decades now has mentored me through learning to build programs in Rust for my work. Even though I “know” that VSCode is what any sane person would learn, I want to learn Emacs—for writing Shell, Python, and Rust (I have a guide for using Emacs for Rust) scripts and programs; for using Latex to write essays, academic work, and for blogging. I’m going to go through all the resources in the wiki here before I ask anything else, but if you have any words of wisdom to share as I get started that would be great!

                    <span>I am using both visual-line-mode and org-indent -mode (with evil-respect-visual-line-mode).
 In an org-mode buffer when trying to move around any block of text that is indented, moving up or down lines makes the cursor jump between columns. I believe this is an issue of moving not respecting org-indent-mode but instead moving based on what the columns would look like if the buffer was unindented.
 ​
 Here is a gif demonstrating the problem.
 Here I am just moving up and down lines (no left or right commands) in an org-mode buffer with org-indent-mode on. 
 Does anyone have a solution for this? Also, should I report this as a bug or is this intended behavior?
 ​
 EDIT: 
 I found this post from 4 years ago describing a similar issue. It sounds like this was a bug then but not sure if anyone has made headway with it or reported it since. (Also if it is a bug is this a bug in org-mode or something related to visual-line-mode?)

                    <span>I have been a Doom Emacs user since I started to use emacs. I recently decided to try out Spacemacs.
 I need help.
  
Is there an equivalent of SPC . in Spacemacs other than C-x d? (to bring up dired preview). If not, can you bind it in the config?
 How do you reload the config? The equivalent of doom&#x27;s, SPC h r r or ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync?
  
I may get more questions as I go along, but here are my first ones.

 I&#x27;m new to haskell and need direction on credible training providers. I&#x27;m a software engineer who&#x27;s retooling to position for blockchain, specifically dapps development on Cardano&#x27;s Plutus platform. 
 Basically, I&#x27;m seeking flexible training providers with a blend of foundational haskell curriculum and custom Plutus-focused blended curriculum. 
 Any help is appreciated!

                    <span>My question is in the title. I know it&#x27;s a bit vague, but I recently learned about org-attach. I&#x27;m intrigued by the possibility of being able to organize my files - my current Documents folder - with org-mode. I&#x27;d much prefer searching through org nodes to find the file I need (typically PDFs or saved HTML files, in my case).
 However, I&#x27;ve found the default ID generation a bit strange. I realize I can use relative directories, but it seems I would need a directory per file if I wanted only one file attached to a node. I&#x27;m just a bit hesitant to not use relative directories and continue to name my files in human-readable format since it makes me a bit more &quot;locked-in&quot; (in a sense) to org-attach, otherwise.
 So...I guess I&#x27;m just looking for ideas and inspiration. If you are, how are you using org-attach, exactly?

                    <span>Hello, I may have an opportunity coming up to drive more FP adoption at work and I am particularly interested in showing how ZIO can help us be more productive and avoid entire classes of bugs I have seen pop up often (e.g., resource leaks and OOMs). 
 A big question I foresee being asked is what happens if there is a bug in the runtime engine. ZIO is still quite new and changing fast. Someone posted a video of a bug they found in Cats Effect 3 related to memory that I can&#x27;t find right now but that is to say it&#x27;s possible for there to be bugs in the runtime engine itself. It would be a legitimate question for my team to ask: what happens if there is a bug in the core of the runtime that we can&#x27;t architect around? Is there a risk that we have to refactor a whole codebase in the future out of ZIO?
 Basically, how do I assure my team that it&#x27;s stable enough to use in production? 
 I know this question would come up (or should) with every dependency added to the codebase, but this is a big one. If you&#x27;re using a third party JSON parsing library (e.g.) and encounter a serious bug, you have more options s.a. using a different library, writing a small library that only addresses your use case (or even just the use case where the dependency has the bug), architecting around it so the bug is not on the execution path anymore, or forking the library and fixing it if you can. With a library like ZIO where the whole app runs on top of it, you may have no choice but refactor the whole thing.

 In comparison, its ported versions for the other editors such as Vim and VSCode have 2.8k and 1.2k stars respectively. And org-roam — an Emacs org-mode extension — has much more stars (3.7k).

                    <span>I use org-mode, have dabbled with Latex, keep a Bibtex file with entries, but I don&#x27;t really know how to put all this together if I wanted to produce a paper. For example, I see all the different formats, so I assume they&#x27;re using a standard science paper Latex template? Also, what&#x27;s the difference between citations and references and where/how do they go into a paper? Do you put them in place or down at the bottom of a page as footnotes? So yeah, what&#x27;s the difference between citations, references, and footnotes? And is there an automatic bibliography maker app?

                    <span>I had just figured out how to make the babel source code block pretty using minted and set the ATTR_LATEX: :options frame&#x3D;single. I understand that I need to put the ATTR_LATEX part before my BEGIN_SRC. It works but I have a lot of babel source codes (50+), is there a way to make this argument global instead of going back every single block and add? By global, I mean somehow put the option at the top of the document.

                    <span>This is kind of a weird one, and I&#x27;m super interested (in both an academic and practical sense) in figuring out why it&#x27;s happening - here&#x27;s a pastebin of my stripped down config file.
 Basically, I&#x27;m an evil user who&#x27;s been writing functions for org-agenda and using general to bind them. I switched from my literate config to just a plain init.el because I found it simpler and wanted to modularize my config, and to my surprise the org-agenda bindings I&#x27;d declared using general suddenly became overridden by stuff in the evil-org package. (In the config I pasted, if you comment out the :after org in the org-agenda block, then &quot;c T&quot; will call a timer function from evil-org instead of the test function I define)
 I assumed that my literate config demanded org on startup, which also demanded evi…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always wanted to navigate pdf files using the keyboard like other Emacs buffers -- so I wrote a minor mode for pdf-tools that allows this. See here.
 Since this is my first major piece of elisp code, I&#x27;d welcome any kind of suggestions on coding style, bad practices to avoid, and other improvements. 
 Also, the whole thing has a major Achilles&#x27; heel: To display the cursor it is added as a highlight into the pdf page object, which is then rendered as an image together with the rest of the page and displayed in Emacs. Each update of the cursor position hence requires a full re-rendering of the pdf page, which is quite slow at high resolutions. If anyone knows of a better way to do this, that would be fantastic!

 Is it possible to show autocomplete popup menu for filling subdirectories and files?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking into sequences. I start with the typically obtuse Wikipedia page on sequences here, then I try to imagine how all this might look in Haskell. I want to stay away from series for the time being, i.e., keep them separate.
 Here&#x27;s one Haskell sequence (with a bit of example here), and here&#x27;s another. These seem to be completely different. I&#x27;m looking at Tom Apostol&#x27;s Calculus and his short bit on sequences, also SICP, and both have examples of limits of sequences, i.e., long sequences. This seems to be about streams, so I&#x27;m guessing the second Data.Containers.Sequence is more germane?
 Somewhere I found this:
 A geometric sequence (or progression) is a sequence of elements from an ordered,numeric type (i.e., a member of both classes Ord and Num) such that consecutive elements have a fixed ratio.
 geometric :: (Ord a, Num a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; [a] geometric r m n | m &gt; n &#x3D; [] | otherwise &#x3D; m : geometric r (m*r) n 
 So this isn&#x27;t trying to be fancy at all, it&#x27;s just using lists. But then this talks about Cauchy sequences
 data Real &#x3D; Cauchy { modulus :: Nat -&gt; Nat , sequence :: Nat -&gt; Rational } 
 So this isn&#x27;t list-land anymore, although I don&#x27;t know what it is for or how to use it. If anyone has any wisdom or tips or insights, I&#x27;d appreciate. In general, I find the world of Haskell and numerical analysis very fragmented, hit-and-miss, like a scavenger hunt. It seems Haskell can bring a lot to the numerical analysis table, though.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m at the LYAH chapter on the State monad. I think I get the basic concept:
 You have a monad containing a tuple. One element is the value of the monad, the other is the environment:
 State (val, env)
 Since the value of State is the first element of the tuple, &gt;&gt;&#x3D; should return the first element of the tuple, like so:
 m &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; (\State (x, _) -&gt; f x) m
 This is not what&#x27;s said in the book; it&#x27;s just what i understand from what i know about monads. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong. And I&#x27;m certainly am, because &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and return are defined in the book like so:
  
instance Monad (State s) where
  return x &#x3D; State $ \s -&gt; (x,s) 
  (State h) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; State $ \s -&gt; let (a, newState) &#x3D; h s 
  (State g) &#x3D; f a 
 in g newState 
  
First, what is that return? What is that lambda? What is that &#x27;s&#x27; parameter? Doesn…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I decided to archive and rip all my Audio CDs to FLAC. I have all the necessary metadata in the FLAC files such as disc number, label, catalog number, etc.. but I would love to have all the information stored in an Org document as well because I believe that it is easier to navigate an Org file.
 Even though FLAC files can contain any metadata, the Vorbis specification allows that, most modern music players are unable to display tags such as catalog number so If I ever need that information I need to open each album in a separate tag viewer software which is more cumbersome than having all the information in an Org file.
 Here is an image, the way I organize the albums in Org mode: https://ibb.co/c1H6Rmd
 I was just wondering if there is a way to do a search like: display all headings that contain the name &quot;Atlantic&quot; in the &quot;LABEL&quot; tag.
 So, my question is basically if is there a way to take advantage of those drawer properties somehow in searching. It is not something very important for me but it would be cool if it&#x27;s possible.

                    <span>tldr: I use Orgzly on Android and would like a similar GUI for Windows (I&#x27;d sync a single org file between both using Syncthing). Any suggestions?
 I know this question is really about org files, rather than org mode. If there&#x27;s another more appropriate sub for this please let me know.
 I&#x27;ve been using Orgzly on Android for some time and really like the simplicity. I didn&#x27;t know about org mode before that. Although I admire the idea of a pure text based approach, I personally do need some kind of GUI, like Orgzly.

                    <span>I have just completed my college in 2020. I waslearning Python and mySql. Now i am working as an intern in Big Data handling MNC. They are supportive, but i want to improve my skills in Scala and then Apache Spark. Start Play Framework too.
 What would you suggest me to do. Ofcourse i want to have a good impression on my employers but learning and getting comfortable with Scala and Spark is much more important to me then this Job. I want to be confident in my skills,
 I can&#x27;t make proper sense from the documentation and i don&#x27;t usually find solutions to my problems easily on google.
 I am weak in Logic building and coding too.

                    <span>Scalqa has a special void request type \/ with a singleton object implementation, which is also named \/. It is used to request a void instance of any type (where supported) in concise and readable manner. 
 For example:
 import scalqa.{*, given} // Scala val v: Vector[Long] &#x3D; \/ // vs. Vector.empty val v: Seq[Float] &#x3D; \/ // vs. Seq.empty val j: java.util.List[String] &#x3D; \/ val f: (Int,String) &#x3D;&gt; Unit &#x3D; \/ // vs. (_,_) &#x3D;&gt; () val l: List[String] &#x3D; \/ // vs. Nil val o: Option[Int] &#x3D; \/ // vs. None val s: String &#x3D; \/ // vs. &quot;&quot; // Scalqa val c: Collection[Double] &#x3D; \/ val o: Opt[String] &#x3D; \/ val v: ~[Double] &#x3D; \/ val b: Byte.Collection &#x3D; \/ val i: Int.Opt &#x3D; \/ val k: Long.&gt;&lt; &#x3D; \/ 
 Generally, if we create a type with void implementation, then we must define implicit void request mapping.
 class Foo object Foo: private object Void extends Foo implicit inline def implicitFrom(v: \/): Foo &#x3D; Void // now it works: val f: Foo &#x3D; \/ 
 Due to the fact that def impliciteFrom is inlined, the \/ resolution is a zero cost call.
 Take a look at real life usage examples: code1, code2, code3, code4, code5.
 \/ is by far the most used Scalqa general request, but there are many others.

                    <span>It seems that Play Framework is not actively developed anymore. There has been no release in the past months, and commits are rare (just Scala steward). It even lacks Scala 3 support. Anyone willing to provide some background why such drop in activity? I am actually very sad, since I loved play a lot (although it was a bit bloated with the final jar).
 I know akka-http is not a proper web framework, but it might work for me, since all connections to my server are done via websockets.
 However, I think these things will still be needed:
  
Sessions (jwt)
 Routing and reverse routing
 Assets and asset fingerprinting
 Handling websockets with an Actor
  
Did anyone attempt such a migration, and how did you fill these gaps? Is there a way to do migration gradually, rather than all at once?

                    <span>Hi all,
 I have an issue with my recursive function - I built it as a List function (i.e. &quot;returns&quot; a List) but now I need to turn it into a function that returns a Set.
 My custom data is:
 data Exp &#x3D; Const Int | Comp String [Exp] deriving (Show) 
 Using this data I can do the following:
 let x &#x3D; Comp &quot;a&quot; [Const 1, Comp &quot;b&quot; [], Comp &quot;c&quot; [Comp &quot;d&quot; [], Const 2]] 
 My List function looks like this:
 collection :: Exp -&gt; [String] collection (Const n) &#x3D; [] collection (Comp n args) | Data.List.null args &#x3D; [n] | otherwise &#x3D; union [n] (concat (fmap collection args)) 
 ​
 Running on GHCi, my output is:
 *Main&gt; let x &#x3D; Comp &quot;a&quot; [Const 1, Comp &quot;b&quot; [], Comp &quot;c&quot; [Comp &quot;d&quot; [], Const 2]] *Main&gt; let w &#x3D; collection x *Main&gt; w [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;] *Main&gt; :t w w :: [String] 
 What I now need is something like this:
 *Main&gt; let v &#x3D; fromList w *Main&gt; :t v v :: Set String 
 ​
 My failed attempt looks like this:
 collection :: Exp -&gt; Set String collection (Const n) &#x3D; empty collection (Comp n args) | Data.List.null args &#x3D; Data.Set.singleton n | otherwise &#x3D; fromList (union [n] (concat (fmap collection args))) 
 ​
 Obviously, this isn&#x27;t working as I&#x27;m passing a [a] into a Set [a] function but I don&#x27;t know how to work this one out.
 ​
 Thanks,
 Asian Guy

                    <span>when i update (install new version via ghcup) and then try and &quot;Set&quot; the new version as the one to use, i get this error: 
 ​
 Error: The version &quot;bin&quot; of the tool &quot;GHC&quot; is not installed.
 ​
 Im not sure what that means or now to fix it, but it makes it so that I am unable to update ghc to a newer version than what im currently using.

 I made a small Vim plugin, vim-ghci, that allows interaction with GHCi in a standard buffer, just type ge on a line, and GHCi executes it and its output is redirected into the file.

 https://github.com/yaxu/hylia-haskell
 It&#x27;s basically working but I could do with some help making a nice interface and testing cross platform. Please jump into this issue if you can help, thanks!

                    <span>Greetings.
 In Haskell, a top-level function and a lambda function which do the same thing have the same type. How can this be, when the lambda might capture some aspects of its environment? I&#x27;d imagine a regular function is just a pointer, like in other languages, but that can&#x27;t be all it is. Do lambdas dynamically allocate space for their captures, and store a pointer with the function objects, so that every function is really a function pointer plus a capture pointer, which would be null in the case of non-capturing functions? Am I wrong to even think of Haskell objects in terms of physical memory?

                    <span>That should read &quot;or functional programming in general&quot;. I did a Flutter code lab called startup name generator that lazily generated an infinite list of word pairs and now my boss told me to learn built_values library for immutability. Then there was the &quot;?&quot;, &quot;??&quot;, &quot;!&quot; syntax for null safety. Also chaining method calls and methods like take seem like they ware taken from Haskell or other functional languages. I am only a novice in both Haskell and Dartlang but can some intermediate ~ experts weigh in here?

                    <span>Sorry if the title doesn&#x27;t convey what I&#x27;m asking properly enough, I&#x27;ll expand it below.
 Lets say I have two blocks, one src and one export. The src block contains the code below, in this example. When exported as html with C-c C-e h o it becomes a code block and shows the src block literally as expected.
 #+name: test #+begin_src html  #+end_src 
 If you use the same block content as above, but put it in a export block instead, it exports the result of the code as one would expect when running C-c C-e h o, however, if you include the src block as below, it is exported literally.
 #+name: export-test #+begin_export html :noweb yes &gt; #+end_export 
 I&#x27;m quite certain that this is due to me missing something, but I&#x27;ve tried looking through the docs and search for a while now, so thought I might as well ask since I&#x27;m clearly missing something.
 I&#x27;m using a setupfile, so the appearance is a bit different, but makes no difference on the result here. I&#x27;ve tested to make sure, but aside from appearance, there&#x27;s little difference. Here&#x27;s a little screenshot of the code in the buffer, it is otherwise empty.
 I want to export it like you would if you had the code in the export block as html directly, as shown earlier. As far as I&#x27;ve found, you can&#x27;t use src blocks to export the code non-literally, and I&#x27;m messing with changing the values of some code using variables, macros and the like on export. Tangling is not relevant in this case, otherwise I&#x27;d be able to do that with a src block.
 Hopefully I&#x27;ve explained well enough, but please do ask if you need more information! I&#x27;d appreciate any help or insight into the situation :)

                    <span>In Emacs, I have a set of TODOs in the following format:
 * H1 ** H2 *** H3 **** TODO [#A] File Taxes 
 If I activate breadcrumbs in org-agenda-prefix-format (i.e., by doing (setf (alist-get &#x27;agenda org-agenda-prefix-format) &quot; %i %-12:c%?-12t% s%b&quot;)), when I look at the agenda-todo view, it shows up as:
 H1-&gt;H2-&gt;H3-&gt;TODO [#A] File Taxes 
 Is there any way to rearrange the agenda view of the headline and breadcrumbs so that it displays like this?
 TODO [#A] H1-&gt;H2-&gt;H3-&gt;File Taxes

                    <span>Hello. I am setting up my agenda and I want to have more than a week on it. Likely, important things in a week shouldn&#x27;t be kept until the week of the scheduled item starts. If I set a higher agenda-span, org super agenda doesn&#x27;t group properly and put everything in any other week in &quot;Today&quot;. 
 https://preview.redd.it/q8rbz1encgi71.png?width&#x3D;369&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6c67c48e68450a9468f67ac76e8bf7b2b2910342
 Can I group properly with org-agenda? I am using zaen view and the groups are basically this repeated: 
  (:name &quot;Faculdade&quot; :tag &quot;fac&quot; :order 3) 
 I thought abour using org-ql, but I don&#x27;t know how to have the timestamps in items and in todays view. I hate doing this kinda of posts as I prefer try to read and figure out but it is been frustrating trying to have an agenda and not accomplishing what I want x_x. If you have a light or any directions I can take please let me know. Thanks for taking the time to read my issue &#x3D;)

 How would you use the Scala 3 deriving mechanism to derive members of this class? Doing it for a polymorphic argument type is explained in the documentation. But what about when you have something like this, where you want to have instances derived for String, Byte, Array[Byte], Json, etc?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a college student going for CS degree. We were taught the basics of programming/OOP with Java, and therefore most of our generalized CS classes had Java support.
 I&#x27;ve always hated scripting languages, loose typing, and manual memory allocation so it was hard to pick another language to try to learn (and C# is just close enough to understand but just different enough to drive me nuts). I love what I&#x27;ve learned of Scala so far, and want to make sure I don&#x27;t get anything wrong.
 I&#x27;ve been successful in following a number of tutorials in Java and converting their code to Scala because I don&#x27;t save many projects of my own. Everything runs and is great but I feel like I&#x27;m probably making some noob mistakes.
 What are some tips for a new Java-to-Scala dev student who very strongly leans towards OOP and away from functional programing?

                    <span>Hello,
How are you all taking reading notes? I have been using a notebook (a bit smaller than A5 size) to take mine. Usually I jot down things in bullet points as I read with a text. But this has been causing some issues. The actual writing takes a bit, and can be enough to get me out of the flow of reading. This usually leads to frustration as I try to write as fast as I am thinking, resulting in a barely legible scrawl. Either that or I take very few notes as I try to stay engaged with the reading material So, I wonder, am I taking notes too often? Should I wait until I am done with a certain section before jotting down ideas? The mental block I have there is that I will forget what I wanted to write down by the time I get to a stopping point.
Maybe it is not the frequency of notes, but the medium. Or maybe both. I have tried using a computer, and that does help with speed somewhat. However, that works best with digital texts, and I mostly read printed ones. Another approach I have thought of is using index cards. That does make processing later a bit easier, and you can group notes freely to see relations, but it can also get messy. What are your thoughts on using a computer for notes? Index cards?
My goal is to have a system where I can read fluidly while writing down things I would like to process later. How are you accomplishing this?</span>

                    <span>I came up with the problem when I was playing with free profunctors that I can&#x27;t (at least easily) create a free profunctor that is both Strong and Choice. Is this even possible to derive? If so, how to encode it?

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me troubleshoot this problem. When I run org-noter I get this message &quot;not enabling jit-lock: it does not work in indirect buffer&quot; in the minibuffer when the new frame opens. Additionally, none of the org-noter keybindings work, which I&#x27;m guessing is related.
 A quick google search returns this stackoverflow post suggesting org-goto wasn&#x27;t working because of multiple org installations. I&#x27;m not sure how to assess my own org installations in case it&#x27;s the same problem. 
 I&#x27;m using doom and enabling org through the init.el file. As far as I&#x27;m aware this is the only org installation I have. 
 Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!

                    <span>Context: I am looking to leverage literate programming in org-mode to create crash courses on tools for my company&#x27;s KB and also create playbooks/runbooks as org files that can be executed as needed.
 My current issue is I want to define a yaml file in an org file src block and then use that yaml file later.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is something to the effect of...
 #+NAME: docker-compose.yml #+BEGIN_SRC yaml ... #+END_SRC #+BEGIN_SRC sh docker-compose up -d #+END_SRC 
 In order for this to work org/babel would need to save the &#x60;docker-compose.yml&#x60; block as the &#x60;NAME&#x60; and then execute the shell src block. Ideally I wouldn&#x27;t want this to clog up my directory, so I&#x27;d want to avoid keeping that &#x60;docker-compose.yml&#x60; file around after we&#x27;re finished.

 This works, but will pollute the dir.…</span>

                    <span>Hi there,
 I am learning databricks and ran into an issue and hoping someone would have faced similar issue.
 I am downloading multiple files by web scraping and by default they are stored in /tmp
 I can copy a single file by providing the filename and path
 %fs cp file:/tmp/2020-12-14_listings.csv.gz dbfs:/tmp 
 but when I try to copy multiple files I get an error
 %fs cp file:/tmp/*_listings* dbfs:/tmp 
 Error
 FileNotFoundException: File file:/tmp/_listings does not exist
 Hoping someone has seen this before

I&#x27;ve been trying to structure my procrastination. I call it positive directional procrastination. These are some of the results.
@thomasteepe has got me thinking about tools for idea creation. Even though this one is specifically a digital one, I still want to credit Thomas. Maybe he&#x27;d rather I not mention him, but oh well. Also, @bradfordfournier&#x27;s idea of a label for zettel that lives on the edge of more than one graph is intriguing. You have to find them before you can label them. This is hard to do when you have 2237 zettel.
At a point in the thread Multi-edges / Named Links / Sub-graph: a means of capturing fluid associations I got excited about the idea of discovering what connections intersect at the edges of thought maps.

                    <span>I usually use 30 minute timers through my window manager to remind me to get up and stretch, switch between sitting and standing, etc. But I&#x27;m also starting up on time logging via org-mode, and now I have two timers to start at the beginning of each task increment. I see that org has a countdown timer feature, but can I get it to play a sound when the timer expires?
 If so, I&#x27;ll also want to start both timers at once. Obviously that&#x27;s a trivial function to write, but does that already exist in the code?
 (I&#x27;ve been using org for years, but in a pretty basic way; just getting in to the more sophisticated features!)

                    <span>I have two columns in a table, one containing dates (column 1) and the other containing a number (column 2). Column 1 has the same date in several rows, so what I want to do is to get the total value of the numbers in column 2 that are on rows of the same date.
 All I can find is getting the total of a column or row range, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to base the range on field values, like a date.
 Sounds simple enough, but I&#x27;m completely new to this, so I could use some help.

                    <span>Hi! 
 Just trying to link up my backend with a really simple web frontend here, I need to be able to respond to individual key presses in a html input element inside a monad that has State and Effect (or Affect). 
 I found purescript-hareactive in a previous thread, but I don&#x27;t know if this is still maintained. Not a huge deal or anything, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a better way to do this now?
 If not, it looks like maybe something with coroutines will do the trick. I saw a forum post by Jordan Martinez on the topic, but people there suggested to use a dedicated frp library. 
 Any thoughts appreciated!

                    <span>Hi everyone! Kit and I are going to be starting a new series in Zymposium on Friday at 11 AM Pacific where we work through building a full stack application with ZIO. Full description and link is below. Hope you will check it out!
 * * *
 This week we are back to the full stack! We will be embarking on building out Zeetup to be a model of a full-stack ZIO application include a server, persistence, authentication, and so on. We&#x27;ll be exploring best practices for working with layers and get practice using different ZIO ecosystem libraries as we build the solution. Come join the fun!
 Register here.

                    <span>Greetings, I have just discovered the Zettelkasten method and am in the process of setting up my Zettelkasten. I am an academic researcher in the humanities.
Sönke Ahrens recommends putting Literature Notes (summaries of texts read) in a reference manager like Zotero. What are the advantages of doing this as opposed to putting it in the main Zettelkasten software? Disadvantages seem to be that links, backlinks, and searching are not possible in Zotero notes. I cannot see any clear advantages, but maybe I am missing something?</span>

 org-tags-view takes ~45 seconds to respond and display all my tags (approx: 100 files of small sizes). How would I go about debugging what might be the bottleneck?

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious, do those of you who are mindful with your notes and links make sure to only link to &quot;previous&quot; notes (those with a lower ID) when creating a link.
Clearly when first creating a note this is the only option, a new note is, well...new, and thus all other notes to which you might choose to link are older and thus you are pointing to previous work.
Suppose at time 1 you link 123 -&gt; 121
Fast forward into your future: what happens if you are editing 121 , and find the urge to reference something in 123, do you let yourself do this? You will now have two links (bidirectional) 123  121.
Does this contradict the ZK principle? If you don&#x27;t let this happen, I can imagine there being a lot of link maintenance that must go on to prevent yourself from accidentally creating a link which is already a back-link into a regular link?
Thoughts appreciated.

                    <span>Based on this question I asked here I&#x27;ve started using org-roam more often recently, and I use LaTeX a lot in my workflow.
 What I want to do is this:
  
Create a table in an org file with some LaTeX math symbols, using the org-mode table handler, e.g.
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable |-----|-----| | A | B | |-----|-----| | $x$ |$\mu$| |-----|-----| 
 
Export just the table to a .png or .pdf file in the directory
 
Insert the .png or .pdf image into the org-file to use as a preview.
 
 At the moment I can do this via C-c C-e C-l L and get a LaTeX buffer that I can paste into a new source block but I was thinking of something along the lines of a python source block to create a matplotlib plot as a .png. 
 Is there something I can do with the export tags, or with #+BEGIN_SCR latex?
 Or is there a way I can directly convert
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable |-----|-----| | A | B | |-----|-----| | $x$ |$\mu$| |-----|-----| 
 to LaTeX source, which is output into #+RESULTS, without having to use C-c C-e?

                    <span>I use A7 paper slips for my reading notes, and I know that others Zettlers use a similar approach too. But, I haven&#x27;t seen much discussion about tracking related reading notes around here.
Either way, I thought of an idea that might possibly make life a little easier for us lovers of standardized reading notes. Here it goes.
We can take inspiration in Luhmann&#x27;s numbering system to manage standardized reading notes, such as A7 paper slips:
The first note gets the address &quot;1.&quot;
If you need to postfix a new character, alternate between numbers and letters from the alphabet.
If you want to add content to a note, grab a new note, take the address of the first note, and postfix a new character in the new note.

                    <span>This is a little insight that came to that I think might be helpful for some. Please let me know what you think.
If you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:
Create Zettels and make connections.
Read sources.
Proofread Zettels.
However, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn&#x27;t become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you&#x27;d spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!
The part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don&#x27;t read, you can&#x27;t create Zettels, and without Zettels, there&#x27;s nothing to proofread.
I think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:
Start with 1 hour of reading.
Read, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.
Reflect on the overall process.
Based on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.
Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don&#x27;t lose time for other things in your day.</span>

 I have tried Googling, but couldn&#x27;t dig anything up.

                    <span>Hi there, 
 I&#x27;m currently learning e/macs and have discovered org-mode and have workflow question. Currently I do all my task, project management and timelog planning through Toggl and Evernote. I use Evernote as a filing cabinet, storing important documents like contracts, tax documents etc, for quick retrieval. However I would like to get away from Evernote, due to its lack of privacy and encryption features. 
 Ideally, I would like to have everything in org-mode, that is: 
  
Notes (I&#x27;m quite ok with plain text notes)
 Files (like a plain text note such as tax agreement, which then links to the actual document)
 Time tracking for tasks and calendar apointments
 Maybe an Agile Results (a productivity system) workflow
 How can I get my tasks in org-mode etc. on my phone on iOS?
  
Is this possible to achieve in org-mode and if so, could you suggest a possible workflow? I have also looked at Joplin as a possible candidate, but it&#x27;s time tracking and todo features are insufficient for me. 
 Thanks, in advance 
 Best regards, 
 ​
 David

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to test the functionality of toList to turn a NonEmptyList a into a List a.
 First of all, there is a toList located in Data.List.NonEmpty and another located in Data.List.Types with the same type signature and I&#x27;m not sure which one I need. In general, I run into this sometimes; what do you do in these situations? Do you look at the source code and sort of figure out what you need?
 Second, I have tried with both and I get the same error for both - &quot;Could not match type NonEmpty List with type NonEmptyList&quot;. What does this mean and what do I need to do?
 Basically, my expectation would be that I can create foo &#x3D; NonEmpty 1 (2:3:4:Nil), then run toList foo and I guess I am supposed to get (1:2:3:4:Nil)? (I&#x27;m not really sure about the output which is why I&#x27;m trying to test it)

                    <span>Hey guys,
 I am trying to run purescript on doom emacs, I uncommented purescript from the init.el so purescript mode is working I get syntax highlight.
 ​
 I have the purescript compiler installed inside the node_modules and also spago. spago builds fine. 
 I am trying to get psc-ide-emacs to work with doom emacs but failing. when I use psc-ide-server-start it says it can find the executable no matter if I go to the folder itself where purs.bin is located. 
 I am using Linux.
 This is my config.el file &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp
 (use-package! psc-ide)
 (add-hook &#x27;purescript-mode-hook (lambda () (psc-ide-mode) (company-mode) (flycheck-mode) (turn-on-purescript-indentation)))
 (setq! psc-ide-purs-executable &quot;./node_modules/purescript/purs.bin&quot;) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This is my packages.el file
 list (package! psc-ide) 
 Any idea? I am new to purescript and emacs so this is getting out of hand fast

                    <span>I&#x27;m actually learning this language for a couple of months now. I don&#x27;t have any experience with Haskell. And I don&#x27;t have any colleagues or developers around to discuss the idioms or Haskell/PureScript way to code. I&#x27;m solving the AoC puzzles to learn and try to get used to it. I think the AoC 2020 d4 puzzle is the one of the best puzzles to practice how to parse and process the data after parsing. Here is my code. Can I have a code review for the idioms or a better way to use this language?

A Brief Intro to Monad Transformers by Solomon Bothwell
A few friends have recently asked about literature introducing Monad Transformers. The best introduction I have found was in Haskell Programming From First Principles. If you don’t have, or want to purchase, this book, then here is a brief explanation with examples.
A brief intro to MTL by Jappie Klooster
That blogpost inspired me to write this, because I can’t find a succinct description on how to use MTL. I learned MTL by staring at reflex for days, if not weeks.

                    <span>Hey guys, Im trying to create an org file that displays all of my school classes and displays their times in org-agenda. None of my classes repeat every day of the week, but instead they repeat every certain set of days (i.e. one class repeats every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; and another repeats every Tuesday and Thursday). How can I create a repeating task/event that repeats every Mon,Wed,Friday or Tues,Thu and continues to repeat until a certain date (the day all classes end for exams)? I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs.

                    <span>On my quest to start a Zettelkasten, I found that most Zettelkasten tools (listed here and on reddit) have no support for hierarchies. With that I mean, methods for promoting/demoting notes in a hierarchy or folding a lower level to reduce distraction.
In Luhmann&#x27;s paper, this aspect seemed really important to him. And I can see how adding lower-level notes helps to keep notes simple and atomic. (Example: notes on cities are listed under notes for countries.)
As I am just starting with the Zettelkasten, I am worried that a non-hiearchical note list will become very confusing quickly. So, how are more experienced people handling this? Did you find software that does handle hierarchies well? Or, do you use summary notes and then link the individual parts?
Would be great to have your insight!</span>

                    <span>Got annoyed by copy and pasting dates and times from web articles, then having to clean the copied stuff up (some websites make it hard to select the date without activating a link, so you end up with the author name or whatever, too).
Here&#x27;s a simple one-liner to clean things up, requiring any Ruby installed:
ruby -e &#x27;require &quot;date&quot;; print Date.parse(ARGF.read).iso8601

It&#x27;s simpler than my previous attempts with a Python script that parses date and time, e.g. from a Zettel ID.
This reads from standard input, looks for a date inside, then prints the 2021-08-11 form of the date.
Here&#x27;s how you can test it by piping static text to the command:
echo &quot;Nassim Taleb Jun 14, 2020 · 5 min read&quot; | ruby -e &#x27;require &quot;date&quot;; print Date.parse(ARGF.read).iso8601&#x27;

You can use Keyboard Maestro, too, for this:</span>

A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing that creates an interconnected web of thought. Its emphasis is on connection and not mere collection of ideas.

                    <span>I am very interested in this topic/question, so I thought to spin it out to its own post instead of talking about it in a post where it isn&#x27;t as relevant

  
I&#x27;m afraid I have to disagree. There is a difference, a sliding scale, a spectrum in ZK work focused on literature, just as there is a spectrum of other types of &quot;X-driven ZK work.&quot; Moving my skills &quot;up&quot; the scales is a goal, and it is always possible to move on the scale. I have to be vigilant that I don&#x27;t backslide. Thinking and writing about the processes used in ZK work help clarify meaning. Some processes are counterproductive to our goals and there is a good chance we are blind to this - from @Will comment here


How would you rank the different tasks in terms of their utility to your zettelkasten? Here is my current ranking from top (highest utility) to bottom
Creating Combinations of Ideas
Creating Variations of Ideas
Creating Nonobvious Connections (e.g. conceptual connections)
Reformulating Ideas from Literature
Adding Notes to a Structure Note
Creating Connections based on Keywords (Obvious Connections)
Copying and Pasting Ideas from Literature
Unsure: 
* Creating Metacognitive Knowledge not for yourself, but for the zettelkasten
* Clarifying Notes
* Organizing Old Notes</span>

I&#x27;m learning about functional dependency and working around overlapping instance problems. I don&#x27;t get how purescript decides which of the two instances of Decapitate to run the decapitate function for the call within genericTail.
 Say you run genericTail &quot;hello&quot;; collection binds to type String. I get that. But nowhere within genericTail am I specifying whether element is type Char or CodePoint.
 So then how does purescript know which definition of decapitate to run? Thank you.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to reverse a string by just running reverse &quot;hello&quot;. I believe I need this one? It has the sig reverse :: String -&gt; String from the Data.String.Yarn module.
 So I added &quot;yarn&quot; to my spago.dhall dependencies list and ran spago build. I get
 [error] The following packages do not exist in your package set: [error] - yarn 
 What do I need to do please?

The error I&#x27;m getting
 Could not match type () @Type with type ( street1 :: String | t0 ) while trying to match type () @Type with type ( street1 :: String | t0 ) while checking that expression { street1: &quot;123 Main Street&quot; , street2: &quot;Apt 152&quot; , city: &quot;Jamestown&quot; , state: &quot;CA&quot; , zip: &quot;95327&quot; } has type { city :: String , state :: String , street :: String , zip :: String } in value declaration person where t0 is an unknown type PureScript(TypesDoNotUnify) 
 the error is a little cryptic for me at the moment, not sure how to fix. Suggestions please? Thanks
