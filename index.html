                    <span>Am helping to test espanso v2 alpha, if I edit the config with emacs/client, save it, it should trigger espanso to reload the file - it doesn&#x27;t.
 Micro works as expected. Espanso v0.7.3 works as expected with emacs. Can anybody think of a reason why that I can share with Federico the dev?
 I also tried touching the config, that didn&#x27;t work either. He is looking at his code as I type so hopefully he will spot something, it is rust and I don&#x27;t know rust :smile:

                    <span>Until recently, my init.el basically just called org-babel-load-file on my literate configuration file. However, this led to slow startups and issues where the wrong version of Org was getting loaded; as such, I&#x27;m trying to move to tangling my config.org.
 As of now, I&#x27;m just setting :tangle yes :results silent as properties on my config.org as well as having a function on after-save-hook that checks if the file I just saved is my config, and if so, to tangle it to init.el.
 This doesn&#x27;t feel particularly &quot;tasteful&quot; though, since it means that if I want to make my config easily clonable, I either have to:
  
Commit both my init.el and config.org to github (which will essentially be the same file), or
 
Upon cloning my config to a new machine, flounder around in stock Emacs before tangling my config manually (with an out-of-date, built-in ob-tangle) and restarting, instead of everything working out of the box.
 
 So, I thought I&#x27;d ask /r/emacs: what do you consider the most &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;tasteful&quot; way of tangling a (single-file) literate config?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to help my friend set up her Emacs. She needs to calculate total time duration from some time data. Currently she uses an Excel sheet to log all start and end times of the events, and then calculate the total time of the events. 
 I think org-mode with timestamps can achieve the same thing. For example,
 * Event 1  * Event 2 CLOSED: [2021-10-11 Mon 5:00] SCHEDULED:  
 the total time is 3 hours. Is there any simple way to do the calculation? I&#x27;ve searched for this but it seems there is no built-in function for this. Thanks.

                    <span>Hi friends! I know that we could control the size of inline images displayed in org by setting org-image-actual-size to 500, or 50%, or &#x27;(500, 400, 300) or adding a #+attr_org: :width 50% :height 50%. But all these methods doesn&#x27;t work for remote inline images, i.e. I can&#x27;t control the image like this: [[https:example.com/image.png]].
 Here is an example:
 original
 show inline image in 20%, but the size of the first image is not changed
 ​
 show inline image in 5%
 So, anyone has any suggestions? How could we let org-mode resize the displayed remote inline images?

                    <span>Hello all, beginner here. I am setting up emacs for python development and am at the last hurdle. I am trying to get emacs to first check if the current projectile directory has a .venv directory, and if so then load that as the virtual environment using pyvenv workon. If no .vevn directory is detected then fallback to a default virtual environment i have set up.
 The code looks like this: 
  
(defun lsp_pyvenv-autoload () (setq default_ven_dir &quot;/home/lordhecomin/workstation/architecture/default_venv&quot;) (message &quot;CONFIRM DEF DIR (%s)&quot; default_ven_dir)~~~~ (let* ((pdir (projectile-project-root)) (pfile (concat pdir &quot;.venv&quot;))) (message &quot;CONFIRM .VENV DIR (%s)&quot; pfile) (if (file-exists-p pfile) (progn (message &quot;INSIDE IF&quot;) (pyvenv-workon (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents pfile) (nth 0 (sp…</span>

                    <span>I was reading through An Introduction to Emacs Lisp, and on the chapter about save-restriction, it&#x27;s mentioned that when using save-excursion and save-restriction one after the other, save-excursion should be used outermost. This advice is also present in the documentation for save-restriction. 
 While the book does give a one line explanation- &quot;if save-restriction is used before save-excursion, Emacs may fail to record the narrowing in the buffer it switches to&quot;, I don&#x27;t quite understand it.
 Can someone please explain this, preferably via an example where something goes wrong if I have save-restriction immediately followed by a save-excursion expression?

                    <span>Basically the title. A friend of mine started using doom emacs, and I like the keyboard centric style of emacs plus the ease of customization (unlike vim imo). 
 That alone got me curious but I am comfortable in vscode at the moment. So, is there something that makes you not leave emacs for vscode? I know that there is a very nice git plugin (magit?) But other than that I haven&#x27;t read anything else. Also I read that code completion and going to function definitions are not easy to do on emacs, which doesn&#x27;t seem right considering how popular it is.

                    <span>I am trying to add a hook that will re-generate the latex fragments when I modify the zoom level in the org buffer.
 Here is my function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview t) )) (add-hook &#x27;text-scale-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) 
 It only works partially. The zoom level is adjusted only in the org section the cursor is currently in.
 From the org-latex-preview function I read that two universal arguments C-u C-u would rebuild the latex fragments everywhere in the buffer:
  
With a C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, display image for all fragments in the buffer.
 With a C-u C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, clear image for all fragments in the buffer.
  
How do I translate C-u C-u to elisp so that my hooked function regenerates the latex fragments in whole buffer?
 I do not think this matters, but just in case, I am using doom emacs.
 EDIT: Solved! Found the solution in this archived thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/67y5kj/what_is_cu_cu_cu_command_in_code/
  
Plain universal-argument actually creates a prefix-argument of &#x27;(4), and multiplies the car of the list by four with each iteration. So try doing (org-cycle &#x27;(64)).
 You&#x27;ll need to look at the actual command&#x27;s source each time to decide what exactly the function is expecting. Check out the doc-string of interactive for more info.
  
So I just added &#x27;(16) as an argument of the org-latex-preview function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview &#x27;(16)) )) (add-hook &#x27;text-scale-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments)

                    <span>The advice here does not work: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ShowParenMode
 If show-paren-mode is called anywhere then the show-paren-mode variable still set globally. If the variable is set then the parentheses do not highlight, so the mode isn&#x27;t active (I assume).
 With this code, show-paren-mode is set on initial load:
 (use-package prog-mode :ensure nil ; not really a package :hook ((prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode) (prog-mode . smartparens-mode) (prog-mode . local-show-paren-mode)) :config (defun local-show-paren-mode () (make-variable-buffer-local &#x27;show-paren-mode) (show-paren-mode 1))) 
 I also tried calling &#x60;(make-variable-buffer-local &#x27;show-paren-mode)&#x60; at top level. It&#x27;s still global even though inspecting the variable, it calls itself buffer-local.
 I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s actually still global because when I call M-x show-paren-mode and open another empty buffer, its state in the new buffer is the same as the old buffer. Going back to other buffers, the state likewise stays the same.

                    <span>I hope you&#x27;ll indulge me for an experiment I&#x27;m running at blog.tygr.info.
 I&#x27;ve built a docker image which asynchronously exports org files in the format requested. I started from this awesome example from emacs-web-server and added a file cache and pdf support. You can see it here: org-ssr
 As you might&#x27;ve already guessed, I&#x27;m going live with it. My blog is being served by emacs.
 That means if you ever have to wait a few seconds to see a page load, you are probably the first person to see that page in that format.
 It also means that with &#x60;url-handler-mode&#x60; enabled, you can browse to my site like &#x60;C-x C-f https://blog.tygr.info/index.org&#x60; to see the website in org mode.
 So now all pages on my blog are available as .html, .txt, .tex, or .org. As I mentioned, pdf is available but I don&#x27;t have texlive installed on my server, so it&#x27;ll just fail right now.
 And yes, I realize there&#x27;s no favicon. I don&#x27;t think there ever will be.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for a long time, but I&#x27;m not a programmer nor an expert. I just really like Emacs and org-mode. The hierarchical structure is not good enough for lists of data with multiple shared parts. I get lost in what is called a Wicked Problem [look it up on Wikipedia if you want] constantly almost always when I include another list, then I need to rearrange the contents of the lists for better comprehension and/or less clutter/repetitiveness.
 Hi, sorry if this seems simple to you, but I can&#x27;t get my head around this so far. I&#x27;ve heard of something called orgmode roam or orgmode brain, but it seems that I am just stuck and constantly looking up more search results while not comprehending much of what i find really.
 ​
 I&#x27;d like some real world examples of how would you solve this problem preferably with emacs/org software if possible

                    <span>I am trying to use org-cite in org mode 9.5. My emacs is emacs-mac 27.2 (aka Mitsuharu Yamamoto&#x27;s emacs mac port). I use ivy for completion, otherwise my emacs is pretty minimalistic.
 When I use org-cite-insert, I can see bib items in my minibuffer, and I can multi-select bib items with enter key. However, I do not know what key or keybind to press to actually insert the bib keys I have selected.
 My org-cite seems to be configured correctly, because if I just type by hand the citation [cite:@key], it fontifies alright. The only problem is, I do not know how to actually auto-insert such citations by org-cite-insert.
 I have consulted org manual, and also googled a lot, no solution so far. Any help on this?
 suggested solutions so far:

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I’m wondering if I should change my phone only because of orgmode app. I am currently using iOS and never found good org app. I heard android orgzly is perfect but never used it. I don’t use my smartphone for mamy things and my iPhone 7 is sufficient for my needs except that orgmode app. Is spending 800 dollars for new phone with android worth it? 
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>During my recent studies into effective learning methods, the phenomena that food plays a major role in cognitive performance has surfaced. Some research observed differences in cognitive performance between 15-20% based on nutrition intake (high cal/protein/fat vs low). From my own experience, if I&#x27;m hungry I get distracted more often and find it harder to enter the flow state of work.
In How Not to Die, the author points to research that observed consumption of burgers/meat lead to a very noticeable decline in cognitive performance minutes after consumption.
In his essay writing guide, Jordan Peterson recommends eating something high in fat and protein first thing in the morning before writing. He also talks about the importance of waking up early &amp; working in the morning. Peterson also said in another interview that he solved a clients anxiety problems by making her eat more. This suggests a link between not getting proper nutrition and anxiety.
The Netflix documentary &quot;The Game Changers&quot;, Connor McGregor puts part of the blame of his loss on eating too much steak - not having energy during the fight. This documentary argues vegetable-based diets are just as effective for building muscle as meat ones, as well as being more healthy for anyone interested.
I haven&#x27;t done much research into this question obviously 
My question(s) to you is: have you experimented with different foods and consumption schedules to boost your cognitive performance during knowledge work sessions? Do you know any interesting resources to continue this line of research?</span>

                    <span>Greetings,
 Began to migration to org 9.5 today and with it to try to adapt the new citations system. I have run into two questions that someone may have the answers to.
  
Trying to use any processor other than &#x27;basic&#x27; results in an error. For testing my configuration is very simple:
  
 (use-package org :demand t :pin gnu :config (setq org-cite-export-processors &#x27;((latex natbib) (t basic)))) 
 If I export to latex with this setup, it results in org-cite-store-export-processor: Unknown processor natbib error. Only basic works. The biblatex, natbib, and csl exporters all result in the same error. Is it really going to force me to perform a (require &#x27;oc-xxx) for each of them?
  
The styles seem a bit limited to me. Is there an option to provide a reference in place without a bibliography? One common use case is produce a list of publications in a chosen order (e.g., NSF-style CVs require &quot;Five relevant publications&quot;). With latex, this is commonly done with \nobibliography and \bibentry. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see support for either in the table provided in the very nice Introduction.
  
Is it possible to not insert a bibliography? It would make sense that if citations are used and exported to latex without the #+print_bibliography directive that it automatically inserts \nobibliography.
 For inserting references rather than citations, is there a style I am missing? It might make sense to have an r style that inserts the full reference in place (if exporting to latex, it would use \bibentry while basic would simply insert the reference text).
 Anyhow, I appreciate hearing whether I am missing something on these issues.

                    <span>Not here to start a war on vim vs emacs bindings. I am just more used to C-n to go down vs j. I really like the look and style of ranger and was wondering if there are packages similar to it but with emacs navigation bindings.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use file links in an org mode document to collect my latex pdfs. When I left click on the link, it opens the file in Atril Document viewer, despite my default pdf viewing application being zathura (zathura is opened by default when I open any pdf from a file manager). I decided to use openwith to try to force pdfs to open in zathura so I added 
 (require &#x27;openwith) (openwith-mode t) (setq openwith-associations &#x27;((&quot;\\.pdf\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;zathura&quot; (file)))) 
 As seen from this emacs stack exchange question
 as well as installing it on packages.el.
 Reloads without issue.
 When I open the file in the console section it tells me &quot;Running atril [path-to-file]...done&quot;.
 I am an emacs beginner so I don&#x27;t really know where to go with this.

                    <span>I&#x27;m an evil user, so &quot;C-k&quot; normally does evil-insert-digraph while in insert mode; however, company helpfully redefines it as company-select-previous-or-abort in its active map.
 Sometimes though, when I&#x27;m navigating to previous company completions, the &quot;C-k&quot; keypress will &quot;fall through&quot; and register as the evil digraph command instead of the company one, which drops me out of the completion I was in the middle of. I&#x27;ve only been able to reproduce this in go-mode while lsp-mode is on; I thought it might be a performance issue as a result of spamming the keypress too fast (I&#x27;m on a fairly weak VM), but I&#x27;ve occasionally been able to recreate it even when I&#x27;m leaving a solid 1 sec pause between &quot;C-k&quot; presses. Anyone got any idea how to debug this? It happens relatively frequently, but really inconsistently, so I&#x27;m having trouble reproducing it on command.

                    <span>Hey everyone, I was talking with a friend about the great text editor and when I talked about packages maintained by &quot;volunteers&quot;, he answered &quot;that&#x27;s awful! What happens if the authors of the package get tired and abandon it? You could have a package that is a whole part of you work flow die ! This seems risky because you have no certitude if the packages come from random people.&quot;
 And I couldn&#x27;t answer because I don&#x27;t know if its common that a package is left to death by its authors, but my intuition was that other people would fork it and still contribute to it or just maintain it... any answer? I didn&#x27;t say much to my friend because I don&#x27;t really know and didn&#x27;t want to say some dumb stuff.
 Thank you for reading!

                    <span>Hello,
 I’m trying to setup gpg encryption for my files in emacs.
 I’ve got the encryption working, and figured out how to get agenda items from said files into the agenda.
 My only issue is that I can’t seem to get full text search working.
 I’ve tried using the grep commands in Doom but they don’t seem to decrypt the files?
 The specific feature I’m trying to get working is Doom’s SPC n s which seems to be a function that calls ivy’s search for symbol at point?

                    <span>A really helpful tool for maximizing keyboard efficiency QMK&#x27;s layer feature, which allows you to hold down one key, and have different functionality for the other keys. Any key can be a layer.
 I was thinking that combining this functionality with something like ryo-modal could make for a very satisfying and efficient modal keybind system. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s any ready made way to do this in Emacs. 
 I think that the closest preexisting thing is Hydras, which basically are layers, except you have to define a keybind that exits the Hydra. 
 So the question is, how can I make the exit function for a Hydra be the releasing of its prefix key? I&#x27;m not sure if this is a simple or complicated elisp task, as I&#x27;m still pretty novice when it comes to Emacs hacking. Any help or insight would be appreciated!

                    <span>So, suppose I name a variable t &#x3D; 0/0. If I only operate 0/0 in GHCi the result is NaN.
 Then I ask Haskell to tell me if t &#x3D;&#x3D; read &quot;NaN&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t work. The results is False.
 Then I proceed to ask Haskell if t &#x3D;&#x3D; 0/0. The result is False.
 What I need to compare t to, so I can get a True value from these comparisons?
 ​
 Obs: I know I could do a &#x3D; 0; b &#x3D; 0. So t &#x3D; a/b. So if b &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 it would return True, then t is indetermined. But I want to directly envolve t in the boolean expressions. 
 ​
 Thanks to anyone who answers.

 Exist it other cypress wrapper library in Scala?

                    <span>I&#x27;m reading (studying) the book &quot;Scala with Cats&quot;. In the chapters on Functors, it includes a section on covariant functors.
 The book describes contravariant functors as &quot;the ability to prepend a transformation to a context&quot;. What is meant by a &quot;context&quot;? All the examples show how, under certain circumstances, you can derive a type-class instance F[A] from F[B] if you have a function A &#x3D;&gt; B. Unlike contravariant functors, covariant functors seem not operate on type-class instances, but on concrete data-types. Are covariant and contravariant functors in two distincly different categories? I &quot;understand&quot; covariant functors. How can I gain a better intuition of what a contravariant functor is?

                    <span>Hello fellow zettelnauts,
I use the ##tag method from Sasha to signify a root link or parent link attached to a note. When I search for ## I also get all the H2 sections.
##links to @#links, is there a way to have a saved search with a joker like to catch every terms beginning with @# like @#$ or @#catchall?
To organize myself I use ttt to signify a note as a terrain in french, meaning field, for me they work not like hubs. And I have the feeling I would appreciate to have a saved search with ttt AND my root tags to get an idea of where my energy is going.
Thank you</span>

                    <span>What&#x27;s the trick to getting my compose key to work in Emacs under Wayland?
 In X/Gnome I configure things so that
  [I] ➜ dconf read /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options [&#x27;compose:ralt&#x27;] 
 and that works in all programs it seems, including Emacs.
 Under Wayland, with Wayfire have
  [I] ➜ grep compose .config/wayfire.ini xkb_options &#x3D; compose:ralt 
 which works in all apps I&#x27;ve tried, except Emacs!
 In Emacs I&#x27;m told that  is undefined. All the instructions I&#x27;ve found tell me to add the file ~/.XCompose with the contents
  include &quot;%L&quot; 
 but that doesn&#x27;t have any effect at all. So, what do I do? What&#x27;s the trick?

                    <span>Org mode can be used as a Calendar where specific dates pop up on the screen? And notice stays on screen until you close it. Or you can&#x27;t use org mode as a calendar?
 What things without login give notifications of exact dates that stays on the screen until you close the alert?

                    <span>I recently switched from package.el to straight.el, and was surprised by how smooth the transition was - everything worked out of the box and the changes to my config were super minimal.
 However, a couple days and a couple modifications to my config later, I noticed that org-related things were breaking. Checking load-history showed that nearly all the org.*.elc files that were getting loaded were from the built-in version of Org instead of the one cloned by straight. 
 Maybe I was just hallucinating that it was ever working: at least if that&#x27;s the case, it provides a way for my best present theory to be true, which is that the built-in Org is getting loaded as a side-effect of me having a literate configuration. I printed the load-path variable at the beginning of my init.el file (which is basically just (org-babel-load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;)), and the straight version of Org wasn&#x27;t on the path yet. This has me thinking that when Emacs hits &quot;org-babel-load-file&quot; it loads the only version of Org available on the path - i.e. the built-in version.
 If so, what&#x27;s the fix? Does keeping a literate config force you to do some ugly workarounds with setting the load-path manually prior to running &quot;org-babel-load-file&quot; or pinning what version of a package you use through straight, or is there some cleaner option I don&#x27;t know of? It seems like Emacs should be able to reload a package to a newer version during runtime once the new source becomes available.

                    <span>Everytime I restart emacs, I have to manually run deft-find-file and org-roam-find-node before my keybindings are able to pull up all the files. If I don&#x27;t do that, deft and roam both show that no files are popping up. 
 I think this is an issue with my use-package config, where the packages are loading on demand instead of by default. Can anyone help with this?

                    <span>Most languages that I work with, I use a code formatter. It takes away a lot of the cognitive load with me having to worry about the code looking good.
 For elisp, I have been using srefactor for a long time, but it has quite a few issues have not been update in 5 years. Most other formatters for elisp/lisp that I have seen has some subtle issues or just does not handle splitting of long lines. People also have suggested just using aggressive-indent-mode and then putting the line breaks manually, but I was hoping to avoid having to decide where/when to split long lines as well.
 Do anyone else use a formatter, any recommendations on a good one?

                    <span>Note: Although the following example is for org-roam-capture-templates, it works in the same way as org-capture-template.
 How can I change the org-capture templates to insert the file name of the current buffer I&#x27;m visiting and format it with a string? create a new file with a name based on the file I&#x27;m currently visiting?
 Example: I&#x27;m visiting a file called book_notes_some_title.org and I want org-capture to create a new file called book_notes_some_title_anki.org.
 The following example doesn&#x27;t work because it will only call the function once - when I evaluate the variable. I need to make it call a function every time I create the template.
 The function simply return the current buffer&#x27;s file-name (through org-roam) and appends _anki.org to the name.
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head ,(format &quot;%s_anki.org&quot; (file-name-nondirectory (file-name-sans-extension (org-roam-node-file (org-roam-node-at-point))))) &quot;#+title: ${title}\nDescription: &quot;) :unnarrowed t))) 
 Edit: My explanation was wrong.

                    <span>Some time ago a proposal for better records was accepted and implemented:
 https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282
 https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst
 This looked very exciting, and would simplify many things related to record access.
 For example:
 data Person &#x3D; Person { name :: String, age :: Int} getAge :: Person -&gt; Int getAge p &#x3D; p.age 
 This is a standard feature in many languages, not having it may have throw off many beginners looking into Haskell.
 Do you know what is the status? Is it available already?

                    <span>I am trying to link to a C++ library and get this weird error:
 : User-specified static library could not be loaded (/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/libgcc.a) Loading static libraries is not supported in this configuration. 
 I use stack with LTS-18.12 and in the cabal file there is:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 The cabal settings are:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 and the ghc options are:
 ghc-options: -O0 -g2 -Wall -Wcompat -Widentities -Wincomplete-record-updates -Wincomplete-uni-patterns -Wredundant-constraints -Wpartial-fields -funbox-strict-fields -threaded -rtsopts 
 This is especially weird, as the exact same settings with the exact same stack LTS are in use in another project and there it works without the error. 
 I am a bit lost about what is happening/where to look at. Does somebody have an idea?

                    <span>Basically I&#x27;m in 3 weeks into my cs degree and have no clue what is going on. We&#x27;re using haskell in our &quot;Introduction to Computation&quot; module. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m incapable of understanding the concepts but everything just moves very fast and I&#x27;m left trying to cram and eventually understanding very little of what&#x27;s going on.
 Maybe this is the wrong place to ask, but how do I efficiently catch up and grasp the concepts so I&#x27;m able to solve basic problems using things like list comprehension and recursion? My grade depends on this because it&#x27;s based on the coursework we submit each week.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated :)

                    <span>Hi Everyone, I am an organizer of a similar data science community like yours. We are involved in &quot;AI for Earth Monitoring&quot; project. It&#x27;s a cool online course created by experts who teach Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using imagery datasets from Sentinel satellites. It starts online on October 18th, 2021. It’s a completely free course. We have about 2k registrations so far but would be happy to see folks from other communities foster exchange between us.

                    <span>Hello, fellow Zettlers!
Being fresh to both Zettelkasten method and this forum, I have to first and foremost ask for your forgiveness if this was already discussed or perhaps it is stupidly obvious, but I struggled to find any threads relating to the following conundrum: how to deal with fields of knowledge or areas of practice, which are subject to significant changes in relatively short time frames?
Example: I am a lawyer based in an EU member state, practicing in a global industry dealing with several fields of law (e.g. intellectual property or privacy law) which are subject to quite dynamic changes (due to legislative actions on EU and state level, ever growing case law, technological changes, etc.). Of course, some concepts fundamental to jurisprudence or terminology specific to a given field may stay relevant for some time. However, due to this high variability, when taking notes regarding more practical and recent issues I face the problem of dealing with &quot;volatile&quot; notes, which feel like they may unexpectedly, suddenly, in any moment become irrelevant, useless or even harmful (e.g. by severing an existing train of thought with a statement which is not true any more).
Maybe this is my lack of understanding, but I feel there is a meaningful difference between evolution of sciences (regardless of its pace), where old models or theories give way to new ones, which explain given real phenomena better, or where new evidence provide a fresh look on the reality; 
legal &quot;reality&quot; may change in an instant, rendering prior statements describing this &quot;reality&quot; not so much obsolete or outdated as simply not true any more (or true exclusively within a bound time frame).
Are there any good practices or strategies helping to deal with such volatility of notes and tending the Zettelkasten without getting crazy?</span>

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;d like to run plantuml source blocks against a locally started plantuml server.
 I start the server with:
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty 
 and I have put 
  (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;( (dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t) (plantuml . t) (python . t) (shell . t) (sql . t) ) ) (require &#x27;ob-plantuml) 
 in init.el but when I try to run the below source block with C-c C-c
  #+begin_src plantuml :file output.png @startuml &#x27; this is a comment Alice -&gt; Bob: Authentication Request Bob --&gt; Alice: Authentication Response John --&gt; Alice: another Authentication Request Alice --&gt; John: another Authentication Response @enduml #+end_src 
 I get &#x27;org-plantuml-jar-path&#x27; is not set.
 What am I doing wrong? Can someone tell me how to get this running?

  (use-package counsel :init (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t) :config (ivy-mode 1) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-s&quot;) &#x27;swiper-isearch)) 
 it seems that I have properly instrumented versions of find-file, M-x, describe-function/variable, etc. But the bindings still refer to the original functions, not the counsel flavored ones, e.g.:
  C-x C-f runs the command find-file (found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘files.el’. 
 When explicitly calling the counsel- ones, I see little to no difference, for example some of them automatically prefix the search pattern with .
 How is ivy instrumenting builtin functions under the hood? What does counsel add in top of that? Is it worth rebinding everything as suggested in the manual? Why?
 Sorry for so many questions but I dislike copy&amp;pasting stuff to my init.el without a clear reason. Maybe someone experienced with ivy can help me (an ido old-timer).
 Thanks!

                    <span>I used to have 3 monitors on my desk, but when I started working from home, I just had the 1 monitor, and for various reasons, I still only have the 1 and it&#x27;s unlikely to change.
 I used to have several small, single-purpose frames off on a second monitor, and one of them was for compilation output. It&#x27;s been 18 months with just one monitor, and I still haven&#x27;t found a solution that I like.
 Currently, I&#x27;ve got a child frame that pops up compilation output in the middle of my main frame. It hides itself if the compilation succeeds. I don&#x27;t really like this because there&#x27;s a lot of extra handling that I have to do, focus switching is weird (like if I&#x27;m in my web browser and click on the child frame, it&#x27;s in focus, but the main frame doesn&#x27;t come to the front. I have to click on a buffer in the parent frame), and it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with which-key, etc.
 I&#x27;ve tried some solutions where the buffer switches to the compilation output and the buffer hides itself afterwards, but those are honestly kinda janky. 
 So I&#x27;m on the verge of going back to a compilation frame--dedicated or not--but then the cues that compilation is still ongoing or has failed or succeeded might be hidden if I&#x27;m working on something else. (I used to try modifying the modeline in every active buffer, but that caused weird conflicts with doom modeline and other things that also wanted to play with the display.)
 There&#x27;s a tradeoff with everything; I&#x27;m not looking for a perfect solution, I&#x27;m just curious what other people do.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to get very good at emacs lisp, but I&#x27;m usually at a loss about what I can do when I want to practice Elisp. What I&#x27;ve been doing so far definitely hasn&#x27;t been working (implementing a function here or there, going through the EINTR and emacs list manual, looking up things online.)
 What&#x27;s worked well for my learning style is to have a &quot;question of the day&quot; programming challenge, where the poster posts their own implementation of a programming problem the next day.
 Does anyone know of something like this for elisp?
 Thanks

                    <span>Hello everyone, I am optimizing my agenda views using org-super agenda, which is great. I would like to group my TODO&#x27;s both by filename and by path hierarchy. I can group by filenamess using the :auto-category selector, or by path hierarchy using the :auto-outline-path selector, but I cannot figure out how to get both. 
 I would like to get something like this:
 File_1.org/Tasks/Coding File_1 : NEXT Write script File_1 : TODO Debug File_1.org/Tasks/Manuscript File_1: TODO Write draft File_2.org/Tasks/Coding File_2: NEXT Run simulations 
 So basically it would like to add the filename to the groups obtained by :auto-outline-path selector. u/github-alphapapa, is this possible?
 Many thanks!

                    <span>When I first started using emacs (only a few months ago) I played around with speedbar which would open in a narrow frame on top of whatever frame I was in. Now I&#x27;ve gone back to it and I find it is opening full screen in it&#x27;s own frame hiding the original frame.
 I&#x27;ve looked thru the manual and I see something about frame parameters but I don&#x27;t know enough to know what if anything I should change or if I should be looking elsewhere.
 Any help is appreciated.

                    <span>Is there a way to have a context-specific expansion, for example using dabbrev or yasnippets, or another package, where a particular text expands to a different (pre-defined) string depending on the file you are in, or better, a buffer-local variable?
 For example, in one file tagged “baywatch-forever”, “david” could expand to “David Hasselhoff,” and in a file tagged “are-we-the-baddies,” “david” would expand to “David Mitchell.”

 boxy-headlines (previously org-real-headlines) allows you to view and navigate any org file as a boxy diagram.
 org-real allows you to keep track of real things as org mode links.
 Both of these packages rely on the boxy.el layout framework to generate interactive and expandable box diagrams.
 The example above shows off some of the available customization options for each package, like flex-width, margin, and padding, as well as the ability to work well in a linux console.
 Enjoy!

                    <span>Hi, I just got to university and my programming teacher told me we would be using Haskell the whole semester. He didn&#x27;t really tell us how to set it up though. All I have used is C# in VS Community and in Unity scripts, so I&#x27;ve always had it simplified in the IDE.
 What I want to know is: how do I start writing/using Haskell code? What is GHC/GHCup/Chocolatey? It seemed to me that GHC is something like a &quot;plugin&quot; required by the machine to run Haskell code, but I&#x27;m not sure of that, and I don&#x27;t even have a guess for what the other terms mean (GHCup/Chocolatey)
 I also tried installing VSCode with a Haskell extension and it seemed to be the most simple solution, but I would like opinions on that: what is best/easier? VSCode or using the PowerShell/CMD with &quot;manual&quot; writing on something like Sublime?
 If the manual way is best, can anyone explain how I install/set up Haskell/GHC on my PC? And how would I run code? If I have a function/method written on a file, what would I do if I wanted to use it? 
 Thanks a lot

 the second syllable is a consonant followed by a vowel (ba, ba, ..., zo, zu);
 the third syllable is a vowel followed by a consonant (ab, ac, ..., uy, uz);
 the same character can&#x27;t appear two times in a row (&quot;abaab&quot; is not a word)
  
for example:
 &gt; take 5 words
 [&quot;abaeb&quot;,&quot;abaec&quot;,&quot;abaed&quot;,&quot;abaef&quot;,&quot;abaeg&quot;]
 &gt; length words
 44100

 I&#x27;m not talking about Haskage FFI binding libraries.
 Can you shed some light on it how you do that?
 It is hard or reasonable easy?
 There some FFI examples online, but those examples are just baby example.

                    <span>I am a developer who works with a ticketing system. I get assigned tickets, they contain details, I complete the tickets, and move on to the next task. I would like to incorporate org mode into my workflow but I&#x27;m not sure how. Here is what I&#x27;d like to do, perhaps someone can tell me the best way to accomplish that.
 I want to be able to create a TODO for each ticket that I am assigned. I want to be able to keep notes on that ticket as well as have a check list of things to do. To include such items as:
  
investigate bug
 create a pull request
 verify with test team
  
Additionally I&#x27;d like to have custom states other than TODO and DONE. Something like TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFYING, and BLOCKED. Finally I would like to be able to assign tags to different tickets so I can track them. So if tickets 1,2,&amp;3 all deal with the UI, then they get tagged with &quot;UI&quot;. If tickets 4 &amp; 5 are done on the backend with Java, I&#x27;d like to tag them as &quot;JAVA&quot; and &quot;BACKEND&quot;. Then I&#x27;d like to be able to filter based on my tags.
 What is the best way of doing this in org mode? Should I be making a new document for each ticket? Just have one really big document with all my tickets? Is there something about this that I&#x27;m missing? I&#x27;d appreciate any clues you guys could toss my way.

                    <span>Hi, i am searching for some library where it accepts some image and returns a collection of characters and their position in image (or obviously something in this direction)
 Would be nice if it could work with &quot;weird&quot; text as one can see in comics.
 I do see some java libraries for this, wonder what is the best one and if there is some scala wrap or alternative (but java is fine also if nothing else)
 thanks.

                    <span>Hello folks! My apologies if the title sounds vague, I&#x27;m looking for advice or project ideas to get an introduction to frameworks such as Play, Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I&#x27;m loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. 
 However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I&#x27;m not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. 
 May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I&#x27;d deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

                    <span>A bit of background information may be useful. I&#x27;m from Uruguay. I graduated from high school with an engineering degree, then requested inscription for the faculty of engineering.
However, I was a poor learner back then. Imagine short-term memorization on steroids. Effective short-term, not at all long-term. In other words, I remember nothing. Not even what an atom is.
I&#x27;m not sure if this is important, but I&#x27;m adding it in case it is.
I&#x27;m taking a gap year and now I&#x27;m working on choosing a career to pursue. I don&#x27;t have the research skills necessary to get anywhere with this, so I don&#x27;t know where to even begin. Also, at the same time, I can&#x27;t do research on how to do research. Thus, I&#x27;m double stuck, if that&#x27;s even possible.
I&#x27;ve tried looking on Google, Reddit, and Wikipedia. Didn&#x27;t help. Too much information, some of it not actionable, and I don&#x27;t even know which is trustworthy.
Any tips on how to get unstuck with this project? If research isn&#x27;t important to complete it, some advice or resources on research would be helpful too. Research skills are crucial for most of what I do.</span>

                    <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m trying to export org-protocol links so I can open stuff directly in emacs, but the ox-html export won&#x27;t even export the link.
 This is the code I&#x27;m using before processing:
 (defun my-open-in-emacs-link (backend) &quot;Add a link to use org-protocol to open a file in emacs.&quot; (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;\\(\\[\\[file:.*?\\]\\[.*\\]\\]\\)&quot; nil t) (message &quot;MATCHED: %s&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1)) (let* ((file-path (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;.*\\[\\[file:\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[.*&quot; &quot;\\1&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1))) (fixed-file-path (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\\(.*?\\)\\(::.*\\)?&quot; &quot;\\1&quot; file-path))) (message &quot;FILE_PATH: %s&quot; fixed-file-path) (replace-match (format &quot;%s ([[org-protocol://open-file?file&#x3D;%s][open in Emacs]])&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1) fixed-file-path)))))) (add-hook &#x27;org-export-before-processing-hook &#x27;my-open-in-emacs-link) 
 So, before processing the org file, go through each link and make is look like [[link][name]] ([[protocol][open in Emacs]]. However the only thing that shows when exporting is name (). The protocol part won&#x27;t show up.
 How can I export the org-protocol link?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am working on adding more packages to NonGNU ELPA, the new package archive enabled by default from Emacs 28 onwards. Compared to GNU ELPA, there is no need for a copyright assignment (the only requirement is that packages do not endorse non-free software, but that is the case for most Emacs-related software to begin with).
 As can be seen here, I have already added contributed a number of popular packages and am waiting for a few packages to be fixed before they are added (I log the progress on these issues on my homepage).
 Going forward, I&#x27;d like to know what packages there would be an interest in adding to the archive? Note that a lot of popular packages are already on GNU ELPA, but I am specifically interested in the packages that are currently just available on MELPA or in no other package archive.
 (P.S. I am not interested in a flame-war on whether or not NonGNU ELPA makes sense or not. I just want to gather a list of popular packages.)

                    <span>You can redefine function in Elisp. 
 (defalias cursorWord &#x27;thing-at-point) (defalias let &#x27;setq) does not work? 
 ​
 Any idea how to redefine keyword like setq to let in Elisp?

                    <span>Under some circumstances - e.g. when using CPU-intensive plugins - emacs -nw can be seen flickering; fortunately, a lot of modern terminal emulators, such as Kitty, support a feature called synchronized updates which allows for what is essentially double-buffering.
 If you are bothered by flickering, this quick &amp; crude patch might help you:
 https://gist.github.com/Patryk27/c7b9dac8113f4ccdb2ef74e0083d9d41
 I&#x27;ve just created it a few minutes ago, but a quick test shows that the code works as intended; I&#x27;ll try using it for a few days and probably try upstreaming it - in a better, more configurable way, that is :-)

                    <span>From laptop keyboard it works as expected.
 When I use an external keyboard (MS Sculpt), the opt-somekey combinations are recognized as Greek/Special characters (π , © etc).
 If I load emacs without any packages (emacs -q) it works as expected.
 So it is some package loaded later doing this? 
 I had &#x27;Chord&#x27; enabled before. I removed it but it didn&#x27;t improve the situation.
 My Setup
  
Mac OS X Big Sur
 
Emacs28 with native compilation (Same issue with 27)
 
Recent Doom emacs config.
 
 I use Doom with several programming modes, orgmode etc. How do I narrow down which package is causing this?

                    <span>I use org to take notes for my classes, and make pretty good use of &gt;&gt; to make vocabulary terms and definitions get automatically linked-to from other parts of my notes (I use a file per class so I only need intra-file links).
 However upon exporting my notes to PDF to share with classmates (so they don&#x27;t have to ignore all the org markup and it looks pretty), the radio links don&#x27;t work. It does remove all the angle brackets, but no links. Ideally I&#x27;d like it to preserve that so people reading the pdf can click links to jump around in the (very long) file.
 Is this:
  
Something wrong on my config (maybe add some kind of #+ line to the file telling the exporter to include radio links? A variable in emacs?)
 Something wrong with my latex install (I have the full scheme of like 2GB of stuff, I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m missing something)
 A limitation of PDF (do PDFs even support file jump links? Interestingly exporting to ODT mostly preserves them - they work similar to how they do inside emacs, but then converting the ODT to pdf doesn&#x27;t work either, and I can&#x27;t leave it as ODT as they&#x27;re all normie MS Word users, and afaik Word can&#x27;t open ODT files)
 A limitation of org&#x27;s exporter (I just can&#x27;t export radio links/have to make [[manual links]]?)
  
Any leads or help would be appreciated.

 Are there any packages that disable using the same command twice (Like repeated C-n or C-f ) so I&#x27;m forced to move more efficiently?

                    <span>When I am using tramp to visit a remote machine in a dired buffer, I mark several files and hit shift-c to copy. But the auto completion of ivy prevents me from copying remote file to local machine, because it does not allow me to delete the ssh prefix, e.g. /ssh:jky@mac:/, once I delete to the slash, I cannot delete further. 
 How can I get rid of this behavior? Is there a variable to set? I don&#x27;t want to switch ivy on and off just to get this work.

                    <span>I use mu4e for my email management and send emails with smtp. When I send an email, I have to wait a a few seconds for authentication and sometimes even longer if the emails contains a large attachment. Also, although rare, I might be offline. Instead, I am looking into queuing my emails.
 I know of smtpmail-queue-mail and the info here, but I am wondering if there is a way to get the emails sent in the background or when emacs is idle and the internet connection is working.
 Any help/hints are appreciated.

 I have a lot of projects. Some work related and some are personal. I want to be able to have profiles, wherein work profile would show only work related projects and personal profile would show only personal projects.
 Is this possible to achieve?
 I am using spacemacs + projectile.

                    <span>I am trying to follow this guide to send emails via eMacs: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bfsck6/mu4e_for_dummies/
 I can receive emails and all the IMAP functions seem to be working (deleting/reading updates other mail clients).
 However, when trying to send emails it just hangs at “sending via mail…” with no obvious errors.
 I’m using ProtonMail and their bridge, with the default SSL mode. If I try changing it to STARTSSL I get either a certificate error or invalid transport method error, so I can see that it’s maybe trying to send the email if the rest of the config is broken?
 I saw this note that using contexts for smtpmail settings as outlined above might not work, but I was wondering if anyone else had thoughts on that? I’d like to not add another application to the mail process if possible.

                    <span>I was trying to compile the latest sources from the savannah.
 The configure step worked just fine but the make gave the following error:
 /usr/bin/ld: comp.o: in function Fcomp_el_to_eln_rel_filename&#x27;:
 comp.c:(.text+0x379): undefined reference to md5_stream
 I tried to clean up everything and make bootstrap but to no avail. Googling this issue also came in vain.
 ​
 I used to update and compile weekly, and everything was alright then. There was a one-month gap since my last update, and I noticed the version was bumped to 29. I was wondering if there is anything new I missed or it is because of something else.
 ​
 Has anyone encountered something similar? I am so grateful for any hints or solutions for this issue.
 Thank you for the help!

                    <span>Hello!
 I have made a blog with Yesod that uses a Postgresql database. I am trying to deploy this to Heroku. 
 I&#x27;ve tried multiple buildpacks but they all time out. I&#x27;ve tried commenting out dependencies and trying to upload it partially and I&#x27;m still not able to deploy it. Tried using Docker but I&#x27;m quite new to using it so I can&#x27;t say that I knew what I was doing there..
 Does anyone have any relevant guide that you think I can follow? Your experience with this? 
 I&#x27;m getting to a point where I&#x27;m willing to pay someone just to show me how this is done.. 
 Thank you!

 Map ((:) x) acc
 I&#x27;m having a rough time understanding how this function should change a list/acc.
 And what about this :
 prefixes :: [a] -&gt; [[a]] prefixes &#x3D; foldr (\x acc -&gt; [x] : ( map ((:) x) acc))
 I&#x27;d like to get full explanation.

                    <span>I&#x27;m so close to nailing the first few steps of my note taking system! The final hurdle for me at the moment is getting org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton to create a much plainer output, and bonus points for it going straight into an org-roam node, but I&#x27;d happy for that not to happen.
 Currently when I run M-x org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton I get the following org-file. I have no idea what the &#x27;contents&#x27; subheading is doing, but it seems to contain random bit from the annotation.
 Ideally I want the command to just output a bullet pointed list with the &#x27;comment&#x27; text. 
 If anyone has experience with changing the output of this command I&#x27;d love to hear what you did and how. 
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs on the whole, so forgive me if the solution appears simple!

 Hello everybody,
 droplet is a type-safe SQL library targeting (so far, only) Postgres. Two main features set it apart from similar PureScript (or Haskell) libraries:
  
SQL like DSL
  
The eDSL used tries to stay as close as possible to regular SQL. IMO, this has the advantage of making the translation from PureScript to SQL transparent, specially for more complex queries.
 So far, most common usage SQL keywords are supported, e.g., SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UNION PREPARE, etc.
  
Query mapper 
  
Query result rows are always expressed as records, with projected columns as keys. The query mapper can also be used independently from the DSL, in case raw SQL strings are needed.
 Feedback is highly welcomed. Specially ideas to improve error messages or ease the current type class abuse :)

                    <span>Michael Tsai featured a couple quotes from Matt Gemmell recently about monospace plain text and fully justified layout: 
https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/09/30/manual-full-justification/
The linked twitter thread is worth a look.
The real banger is this document: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588741-super-metroid/faqs/10114
You don&#x27;t have to actually read it; it&#x27;s a guide/walkthrough for a Super Nintendo game. The interesting detail is that the author accomplished full text justification without tweaking the spacing between words. That&#x27;s how you usually accomplish that effect in e.g. MS Word or other desktop publishing applications. The space between words is stretched.

But here, there&#x27;s only ever 1 space between words.
So the author had to write everything to fit. Conversely, that means words and sentence structures had to be picked because of their length to properly fill the available space.
Matt Gemmell points out that this is not a feat one is likely to accomplish for the lulz. It&#x27;s serious effort. And that document sure as heck is long! Now that&#x27;s some plain text dedication</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone. My work company is switching towards mandatory 2FA when logging in, and I am currently using offlineimap. As far as I know, it doesnt support 2FA, has anybody here found a workaround on this? It is an office365 Exchange account in case it is relevant.
 It would suck if I have to leave my emacs for managing my email...

                    <span>Hello all! I would be grateful for any help with a question about org-mode. I love using org files, and displaying them in Emacs is wonderful: I have my config set up to present subtrees indented, hide leading stars, etc.
 However, I would like to improve how my .org files look when accessed by other editors (or when printed out). Without the illusion of indentation that comes from editing .org files in Emacs, the documents are (at least in my opinion) extremely hard to decipher at-a-glance; there is no obvious visual relationship between headings and subheadings.
 Ideally, I would like for the content under subheadings to actually be indented in the text files, so that they would be easy to read/skim in other editors. My searching led to me to this page in the manual, which seems to explain that this can be done if the following settings are used:
 (setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-odd-levels-only t) 
 However, even after adding these settings to my config, the behavior doesn&#x27;t change: when I save a .org buffer, it is written to disk without hard indentation. Did I misunderstand something about how this works/should work (perhaps I missed something obvious)? Has anyone else had better luck making this happen?
 Many thanks in advance for any help.

                    <span>TLDR: Try consult-dir and embark
 Lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of config hacking. I use Doom as my main daily driver, but starting a vanilla config and playing around with various packages has taught me a lot of cool stuff and helped me rethink parts of my workflow that have been fairly sub-optimal until now (naturally there&#x27;s still lots of room for further refinement).
 Yesterday and today I&#x27;ve migrated features from my vanilla config that I particularly like into my Doom config. While doing it, I got carried away with the latest commit message, which related to adding my consult-dir and embark configurations into Doom. These are both great packages and I am more than happy to do what I can to give them more attention and hopefully convince some people to check them out! Here are links to…</span>

                    <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m trying to make flymake work with a custom init function. First I needed this to make it work on the linux kernel source. I found a stackoverflow answer that creates a flymake.mk in the root of the project and makes flymake to look for that file, which only contains the make recipe check-syntax.
 Of course that didn&#x27;t work. Flymake log says: *** No rule to make target &#x27;check-syntax&#x27;. Stop.
 So I did a way simpler project, just a file.c and a Makefile, with default flymake and that worked fine. So I removed the check-syntax part from the Makefile and put it on a flymake.mk, all three files in the same directory. Now again with the custom init and doesn&#x27;t work either. First of all, I tried to see if the custom init was being selected, and it does, when I run (flymake-proc--get-fi…</span>

                    <span>tldr; You can use C-u M-x command-name to pass the Universal Argument into an interactive command. This is helpful if you do not want to bind the command to a hotkey, but still want to pass the Universal Argument into it.
 I recently encountered a situation with the anki-editor package where I wanted to pass the Universal Argument into the anki-editor-push-notes function. I did not want to create a keyboard shortcut for this command because I will use it less than once a day. First I tried things like M-x anki-editor-push-notes(4) and M-x (anki-editor-push-notes &#x27;(4)) but neither of those worked. Then, following this guide, I created a wrapper function that calls (anki-editor-push-notes &#x27;(4)). This worked fine. I could call my wrapper function which would in turn call the function I really wanted to run with the Universal Argument passed in; however, I figured out a more succinct way. Pressing C-u M-x anki-editor-push-notes will pass the Universal Argument into the command. In my opinion this is better because I don&#x27;t have to have that extra function in my init.el and I don&#x27;t have to remember two slightly distinct commands.
 I figured if I didn&#x27;t know about this and the author of this guide may not have known about this, then there may be other people on the subreddit who do not know about this. So I am just trying to share a cool thing I learned.

                    <span>I use the i3wm on a two monitor setup. 
 I generally have one Emacs GUI window/frame with my org-agenda buffer and mu4e continually open on a single workspace on one monitor. 
 Then I open a new instance of Emacs (in a new frame) for whatever project I intend to work on. If I want to pivot to an unrelated project/task, I open a new Emacs frame and edit the relevant files to that project there.
  
I&#x27;m curious to know if this is the standard in the Emacs community. I sometimes think this workflow is a bit too resource intensive, and it seems wasteful to execute init.el several times and load all my packages etc. every time I do something new (although it takes &lt;5 sec to load, which I&#x27;m happy with).
 An alternative would be running one instance of Emacs, then doing e.g. C-x 5 2 to open a new frame (but now init.el is not re-evaluated) every time I want to work on a different project/task. This also feels a bit resource heavy -- maybe the resolution of this problem is just to not open so many things at once!
 What is your workflow, and do you think it&#x27;s efficient memory wise, or helpful in terms of organization?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to write an emacs w3m filter for duckduckgo lite. I thought it would be cool to leverage magit-section, and have each result in its own section. So I have a function for inserting the sections from parsed &#x27;result-groups&#x27; (a group is all the DOM material for one result):
 (defun my/w3m-insert-duckduckgo-section (group) (let ((href (cdar (cdadar group))) (title (caddar group)) (body (cddr (nth 1 group)))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; title))) (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;))))) 
 I&#x27;m using the &quot;this-is-the-body&quot; string in place of an actual body at the moment, because I haven&#x27;t got round to learning about parsing DOM text yet.
 I run this in a loop over all the groups, inserting each one. This runs inside a root section I insert first.
 This inserts the relevant text, but with no special properties (e.g. magit sections normally have certain faces) and no newlines. Everything is on one line, just running on to the next result.
 If I run something like this in a scratch buffer, the result is correct:
 (magit-insert-section (root) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;Header text 1&quot;)) (insert (format &quot;%s\n\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;Header text 2&quot;)) (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;)))) 
 Running eval-last-sexp after this in the scratch buffer works exactly as expected (standard magit section text properties, newlines are printed correctly). What&#x27;s most stange is that if I use eval-expression to run the above form in a w3m buffer, it works correctly! Correct faces and properties etc.
 So, why do the newlines and properties not show up in the w3m buffer when I call the forms programatically vs interactively, and how can I fix this?
 TIA!

                    <span>Hi emacs lovers, i use mu4e for my mail and changed to the new gnus message view, which has some nice properties amongst others an indication how long ago a message was sent.
 However, I get all the time a popup window called *appease-gnus*, which i can kill (C-x k) but keeps popping up. It looks like a hook is executed when point is on the Attachment field in mu4e:view.
 ​
 Does anyone experience this as well and knows how to stop this popup behaviour?
 Thanks in advance 
 Marcel

                    <span>Is Emacs secure ? As in, if I install some packages, will that poses any &quot;security threat&quot; to my computer ? If I rephrase that - can we make Emacs more secure maybe ? I may sound silly, but if you have any thoughts about that same, I&#x27;m very much interested in that. 
 Thank you.

 I have a question for the Emacs community. How can Emacs help me ? I am willing to take the learning curve, but how is Emacs better than Scrivener ? That&#x27;s my main question.
 Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a cookbook using emacs org mode, and org-chef to import recipes. I set it up so that I can export to a printable bifold booklet that I can use in the kitchen, and it exports to my website: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/
 I have a couple more things I&#x27;d like it to do:
 So far I have been manually inserting page breaks with #+LATEX: \newpage to prevent recipes from splitting across odd numbered pages, so you don&#x27;t have to flip a page to see the rest of the recipe. I&#x27;d like a way to automate that if possible. I usually adjust the font size a bit to get everything to fit on a multiple of 4 pages for printing.
 On the HTML end, I&#x27;d like a simple way for each recipe heading to link back to the table of contents, to make the page easier to navigate. It would also be nice if I could get the title of the page to export as a h3 instead of h1, to match the sidebar.
 I have the org mode source here if anyone wants to take a look: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/recipes.org

                    <span>Carsten Dominik in his Google TechTalk said that Emacs is for people who like to tinker, and that has definitely been my experience and one of the reasons I love Emacs so much. (link to talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;oJTwQvgfgMM )
 I have been using Emacs since 2016, and would roughly estimate that I have spent 100+ hours configuring Emacs to my liking (only using other packages and writing small custom functions), and I still play around with my init most weeks to update it and fine tune it to my liking. Although I could use something like Doom or Spacemacs and get a pretty awesome environment with minimal setup, creating and customising these things to my own personal taste is super satisfying. 
 Was just curious, how much time have you all spent configuring your beloved setup? :)

 At the time hl-block-mode didn&#x27;t support this, since then I&#x27;ve added options to support this.
 Example configuration:
 (use-package hl-block-mode :commands (hl-block-mode) :config (setq hl-block-bracket nil) ;; Match all brackets. (setq hl-block-single-level t) ;; Only one pair of brackets. (setq hl-block-style &#x27;bracket) ;; Highlight only the brackets. :hook ((prog-mode) . hl-block-mode))

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to make some bindings to a c library. The C library has a whole bunch of constructors and special destructors. Which means I can&#x27;t just free everything with free; I have to use the correct c function.
 My plan was to use the ReaderT monad to hold pointers of the allocated objects and create a typeclass for deletion which would trigger when things fall out of scope:
 class Collectable p where collect :: (MonadIO m) &#x3D;&gt; p -&gt; m () newtype CThing &#x3D; CThing (Ptr ()) instance Collectable CThing where collect (CThing p) &#x3D; ffi_c_delete_function_for_thing p 
 I then created a newtype called &#x27;Bin&#x27; for holding these objects:
 newtype Bin &#x3D; Bin { unBin :: forall p . Collectable p &#x3D;&gt; [p] } 
 The reason for this is that it complained about impredicative polymorphism if I didn&#x27;t create the newtype. It also didn&#x27;t like:
 newtype Bin &#x3D; Bin { unBin :: [forall p . Collectable p &#x3D;&gt; p] } 
 For the same reason.
 I then tried to call the delete functions on the environment:
 mapM collect $ unBin env 
 But GHC complains again:
 Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘collect’ prevents the constraint ‘(Collectable a0)’ from being solved. 
 Why can&#x27;t it solve the constraint? I have defined a bin to contain only collectable objects!?
 As you have probably worked out by now, I have very little idea what I&#x27;m doing when it comes to higher rank polymorphism! send help!
 I have a backup plan (creating a type level list for the environment and using type families to construct the Collectable class), but it seems excessive

                    <span>I recently started using roam a lot more and really love what it has to offer. I started migrating many of my notes, api org files (used with verb) and other things at work into it&#x27;s own private org repo. What i&#x27;d like to do is actually somehow combine the content of the repos together without actually having them go to the same repo. So at work, I can add work fiels to the work repo, while at the same time have the db include my personal files that I can also update. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s ways to manage this seamlessly so that I can not have my private content mixed with my public.

                    <span>How can I set a task to repeat only on weekdays with some specific time?
 I see some documentations Repeated tasks - Org mode, and packages like org-recur, other way that I saw on a suggestion is:
 * TODO Some task SCHEDULED:  * TODO Some task SCHEDULED:  
 Is set the same task to each day from the weekday, but I think that this approach isn&#x27;t correctly.
 Do you know if is there a way to do some task work with only weekdays (Mon to Fri) with a specific time?

 I have a question for the Emacs org-mode community. How Emacs org-mode can help me ? I am willing to take the learning curve, but how is Emacs org-mode better than Scrivener ? That&#x27;s my main question.
 Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>Is there a good strategy for calling C code from Scala? I know there’s JNI and JNA but they’re both pretty painful. There’s sbt-JNI, which seems good. There’s also graal but I don’t particularly want to run my C++ stuff on the VM too. Seems unnecessary. What I really want is some kind of pybind11 but for the JVM. Maybe something like cppsharp. Any thoughts?

                    <span>v1.7.2
Example string of tags with the last one in the series having lost its link decoration.

It seems this behavior is when tags are not on the last line of the file.
Let me explain the following GIF. 
I then line feed 3X, and up arrow, so I&#x27;m not on the last line of the file, and after each tag, a space character causes the last tag to lose its link decorations.
Notice the tag in the YAML block. It is not on the last line of the file, and it has no link decoration because it has a space character after it.

EDIT::
It is the last word in the tag that loses its link decoration. In this screenshot, only the second half of the two-word tag is affected.</span>

                    <span>ok - so I&#x27;m trying to do something I THINK should be simple, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it.
 I want to do something pretty conceptually simple. But I don&#x27;t know enough elisp to figure out how to do it.
 I have helm configured with helm-bibtex, I have org, and org-roam, and org-ref all more or less installed and working.
 EDIT: in response to a comment below - I also have org-roam-bibtex as well. 
 What I want to have happen is when I open helm-bibtex and select a paper, and then select edit notes, that instead of opening a note with the paper title (as it does now) it runs the org-roam capture template and creates an org-roam node (if one doesn&#x27;t exist) or opens an existing org-roam node (if it already exists) with the the cite-key as the file name, the paper title as the title, the author&#x27;s name filled in, etc.
 Any idea how I can do this?

                    <span>Now pressing &#x60;C-c C-e h o&#x60; takes half a minute to generate one HTML export. 
 Some one posted the same question a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/mmdeei/how_to_speed_up_org_exportpublish/, but things may get worse as org-roam files number goes up.
 Do any org-roam users run into the same issue? I guess I could consolidate multiple org roam files into one while still keeping the node IDs. 
 Do you have any workarounds or comments?

                    <span>Hello all,
 I have been using org-noter and pdf-tools for taking notes during lectures and annotating the slides. However, I would like to have an option to :
  
Automatically update my notes with the highlighted portions, without having to call org-noter-create-skelton every time (more over this function executes interactively so I have to select the options every time). This would make it easier to switch seamlessly between the pdf and the notes.
 When adding precise notes with the shortcut M-i, highlight the corresponding portion in the pdf automatically.
  
Is there any config that I am using missing to achieve these two features ?

                    <span>I am required to write a function that compares the elements of two lists in Haskell. I want to write the function to have the data type signature a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]. Here, the a can either be Integers or be tuples (Integers, Integers). I want my function to work in both cases. However, as far as I am aware, tuples cannot be compared with the &quot;&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot; sign, right? So, the function I have so far
 findE n [] &#x3D; []
 findE n (m:zs) &#x3D; if (n &#x3D;&#x3D; m) then findE n zs else m:(findE n zs)
 will work fine for when a &#x3D;&#x3D; Integer but not for when the elements in the list are two-component tuples right? I was looking for how to improve my code so that it works for both cases. Also, it would be preferable if no modules need to be imported unless absolutely necessary to make this function universal for a lot of types. Thank you!

 (c) Write a test function prop_totalScore_pos that checks that total Score always returns a number greater than or equal to one.

                    <span>I am looking to write a zip function in Haskell, such that each element of list 1 combines to form a tuple with each element of list 2, something like -
 zip&#x27; [0,1,2] [3,4,5] &#x3D; [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
 I was wondering if there is a way possible to describe such a function using the original zip. Or ideas on any other way in which this can be done are appreciated!
 I was thinking of &quot;zip (map list1) list2&quot; however this is not really yielding the results it should.

 So I would like to place a static file somewhere inside my source library, a git repository with a directory of Haskell modules together with a cabal file. But what&#x27;s the best way to configure the location of that static template file? What&#x27;s the best way to access it from file system as the default file from within my code?

                    <span>I am writing a code to check if two lists in Haskell contain the same elements. I cannot use library functions for my code, however. Any advice on how I should proceed with this? Although ideally, I am interested in knowing if there is a way to do this even if the lists have duplicates, I am thinking of writing a code to remove duplicates and then check if the two lists are equal. I already have the code written to remove the duplicates, but cannot think of what to do next to actually compare the lists both ways (i.e, to check if both have exactly the same elements).

                    <span>Trying out a modest venture of solving competitive coding problems in Haskell. I am using Hackerrank for the same. I intend to create a YT series so that some student just stumbling into the world of Haskell programming might benefit from it.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get a better grasp on the type system of purescript. One thing I&#x27;m struggling to fully understand is how the so-called &quot;kind system&quot; works. The language reference is very brief about it.
 Are there other resources available (perhaps with more examples) that explain this?

                    <span>Hello fellow Zettelkasteners. I have heard that zettel notes should be written in one&#x27;s own words. But I have never understood what it means to write notes in your own words. Most of the time I just copy a passage with minor changes or I translate an English passage as if I copied it.
I thought about different strategies. I could first read a paragraph, then close the book, then rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text. Or I could simply read the text and not bother with the information within and just write my thoughts that could come into my mind. Or I could write the note as if I explained it to my mom.
Note that I write my zettel notes in Romanian so when I read a text in English I translate it in Romanian. Not that it helps.
Am I missing something? Can you tell me how can I write a zettel note without copying from the text or write it in my own words?</span>

                    <span>I got a version of snake working with the threepenny-gui library, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that I was explicitly calling newEvent and addStateUpdate manually instead of defining the behavior completely based on events, e.g. this:
 (updates, addUpdate)  addUpdate $ \manager -&gt; manager&#x27; 
 compared to:
 managerB  \manager -&gt; manager&#x27; 
 IIUC the second is more idiomatic FRP, as it defines a behavior with the actual event instead of creating a proxy event to proxy updates through. But when I make this change, it causes one of two problems:
  
If I define managerB first (using RecursiveDo to access timer, which is defined below), nothing&#x27;s rendered at all
 If I move managerB to the end (using RecursiveDo to access managerB from the DOM elements), the initial movement when hitting an arrow key for the first time lags, and the frames render in a jerky fashion.
  
Am I doing something wrong? What&#x27;s the idiomatic way I should structure these events/behaviors?

                    <span>You can find the code here: https://github.com/santiweight/poker
 Over the last 1-2 years, I&#x27;ve accumulated a good amount of poker-related code that I think would be best to share! Over this week I&#x27;ll be adding some more libraries to the collection of poker libraries, but this is a good place to start :)
 I&#x27;m hoping for:
  
feedback: anything you think/feel about the library and its goals
 usage: try and use the library - tell me if it&#x27;s helpful...
 review: look at the library code, let me know where I need to make improvements.
  
I haven&#x27;t yet been able to upload to Hackage, because I don&#x27;t yet have uploader status. I&#x27;m not restless here (I only asked for permission last night). But let me know if you have any issues downloading. I&#x27;ll also be around all day (west coast USA) to discuss the code in chat or phone call.

                    <span>in polysemy, freer-simple and effectful there are two different functions for interpreting an effect:
 interpret :: e :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; (e a -&gt; Eff es a) -&gt; Eff (e &#x27;: es) a -&gt; Eff es a reinterpret :: e :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; (e a -&gt; Eff (e&#x27; &#x27;: es) a) -&gt; Eff (e &#x27;: es) a -&gt; Eff (e&#x27; &#x27;: es) a 
 reinterpret is mostly used to interpret an effect into several other effects:
 m :: Logging :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Eff es () myHandler :: Writer [String] :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Logging a -&gt; Eff es a reinterpret myHandler m :: Eff (Writer [String] &#x27;: es) () 
 However in any case I am aware of, I could also use interpret to reach similar goal, even with a more lenient signature:
 interpret myHandler m :: Writer [String] :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Eff es () 
 Given that, is there practically anything that is only representable via reinterpret?

                    <span>For example a defined syntax shows Nat:
 data Exp &#x3D; Zero
 | Succ Exp
 &quot;No instance for (Arbitrary Exp)&quot; error shows up when I tried to check on some function which are using Exp. 
 It seems like I should set a instance for the Exp because it is not support in Prelude, this link gives some examples, but I am still struggling on create instance for Exp, any instructions on this? Yes, I am new to QC, I would be appreciate!

                    <span>I would like to pick up a workflow manager for my data transformation and analysis pipeline. As it&#x27;s comprised of calls to bioinformatics command line tools and custom R scripts that sometimes have to be submitted to an HPC, I require a fairly flexible solution. 
 There are a billion of them out there (https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), so the decision which one to choose is not exactly easy. Most of my colleagues rely on Nextflow and Snakemake, so I should consider these, but before I start to learn an entirely new language I wanted to explore the Haskell ecosystem for possible solutions. Strong typing should in theory be a perfect match for a pipeline manager. And having this in Haskell would simplify replacing some of my R code with Haskell eventually.
 So far I saw three tools:
  
Funflow: https://github.com/tweag/funflow
 Porcupine: https://github.com/tweag/porcupine
 Bioshake: https://github.com/PapenfussLab/bioshake
  
Is here anybody who uses any of these in production and could share their experiences? Are there other Haskell-based pipeline tools? Is the user community for these tools just to small to make them a feasible choice?

                    <span>I posted something similar before but can I get an opinion on this: https://www.sandromaglione.com/how-to-use-fpdart-functional-programming-in-dart-and-flutter/
 Dart is a null-safe language that I am using for Flutter development and because I want to learn Haskell but my new job takes up so much of my time, I am looking for options where I can combine both. However, reading the documentation above, and with my still-novice Haskell knowledge it is not immediately clear to me if:
 - this is going to help me learn Haskell
 I am already using a package called Freezed for immutable classes (along with a state management package called Riverpod) which in tandem with null-safety makes the code &quot;error-safe&quot; enough. 
 FYI shifting from almost purely academic coding to &quot;doing-it-for-a-living&quot; was invigorating at first but now I feel trapped because I have to learn and get better at what my company uses (Dart, Flutter, FastAPI) leaving me too exhausted. I finally had a whole day off today but still ended up polishing the app I am working on. There has to be light at the end of the tunnel?

                    <span>Org 9.5 has been recently released, and the Org project is looking for help.
 The best way to help are these:
  
Check confirmed bugs and try to provide a patch to fix them.
 Check requests for help and volunteer to tackle one.
 Check *.el file that have no maintainer and propose to become one.
 Please see others ways to contribute as detailed on Worg.
  
When contributing, always beware of the maintenance burden: are you alleviating it or are you adding to it? Be bold, take ownership, be constructive, learn the ropes with the community and enjoy!

                    <span>The Haskell.org committee is considering a change to the Haskell.org Downloads page. The change is being reviewed in a GitHub PR.
 The specifics of the change are to replace Chocolatey with ghcup as the preferred installation method of GHC, cabal-install and haskell-language-server on Windows. The overall effect is that the install instructions become common over Windows, Linux and MacOS. The Chocolatey install method is mentioned further down the page. (The PR does not impinge on Stack. The Stack instructions remain unchanged.)
 The committee would welcome input from any interested parties, particularly those who have familiarity with Chocolatey, or ghcup on Windows, or both. You are welcome to comment on the PR itself.
 Thanks to bodigrim for the PR.

                    <span>hi all,
 new to orgmode. can someone help me amend the following sample config? 
 C-c c t adds a todo item under a title &quot;Tasks&quot; like this:
 *Tasks
 ** TODO todo item
 but i would like to add the todo item without the *Tasks title. also, if possible i would like it to be inserted at the top of the file as the first in the list instead of the bottom.
 any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

                    <span>Is there a way to have the carry-over of unfinished-todos that org-journal offers to also work in org-roam dailies? 
 I do like the &quot;integration&quot; of my dailies (which I often use to structure my day - a bit out of my head, maybe because I do not harness the power of the agenda yet..) and also the fact that there are some backlinks when I just jot down some notes on it.
 But I am missing the feature of taking unfinished todos from the past to the current day - to finish stuff that I could not finish the last day..
 Any ideas about this?

                    <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 I&#x27;m experiencing some doubts when implementing the behavior of my entities using companion object, case class and the new given/using concept(the reborn implicit).
 So...
 Let&#x27;s imagine that we are defining an User abstraction that should contain the behavior of addFriend.
 Is this the right location to place the addFriend method and to consume it?
 Idk... It doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;right&quot; this need of declaring given User &#x3D; user and calling the addFriend from the companion object
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala sealed trait User(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User])
 object Users { enum UserProfile: case Common
 final case class CommonUser private(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User]) extends User
 def create(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User] &#x3D; List()): User &#x3D; { ... }
 def addFriend(friend: User)(using user: User): Unit &#x3D; { ... } }
 val myUser &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeMyUserId&quot;, &quot;fakeMyUserName&quot;) val friend &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeFriendId&quot;, &quot;fakeFriendName&quot;)
 given User &#x3D; myUser val myUserWithFriends &#x3D; Users.addFriend(friend) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>When reading texts, I occasionally find that I didn&#x27;t understand something very well.
I follow a modified version of the Feynman Technique for writing Zettels. Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.
However, when there are gaps, I&#x27;m not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I&#x27;m most energetic in the morning. Thus, I&#x27;d rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.
But, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I&#x27;ve written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text. I&#x27;ve tried multiple approaches to deal with this to no avail.
So I ask: What is your approach to handle gaps in your understanding when processing reading notes?</span>

                    <span>Hi, brand new Zettelkaster here - as in, I&#x27;ve been reading blogs about it and just ordered How to Take Smart Notes but I haven&#x27;t started implementing anything yet. I feel like I&#x27;ll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I&#x27;m going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn&#x27;t up to the task).
My existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.
Since I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.
I have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that&#x27;s the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there&#x27;s software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.
Thanks very much in advance for your help!</span>

Which books would you recommend?
And is &quot;Sascha&#x27;s book published&quot;?
Maybe there should be a FAQ section somewhere collecting info ressources like books and videos?</span>

                    <span>Hello,
 In my org-mode workflow, I export the work done in the week and all current tasks with:
 elisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;W&quot; &quot;Weekly Review&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 7))) (todo &quot;TODO&quot;) (todo &quot;STRT&quot;) (todo &quot;LOOP&quot;) (todo &quot;WAIT&quot;)) ; review waiting items ((org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t))) ))  Then I write the list with org-agenda-write. The problem is that I loose heading tree during the process.
 What I got:
 org * DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] * TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 What I want: org * API development ** DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * Architecture ** DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] ** TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 Is it possible to keep global heading when exporting agenda view ?

                    <span>I&#x27;m thinking about how to efficiently using org-mode to make notes while reading a large presentation (e.g. a PowerPoint file, .pptx-file, with a few hundred slides). Any thoughts on this? 
 I&#x27;m looking for tips in general and to see if this topic results in some interesting discussion.
 The tips could e.g. be about how to use org-mode, how to structure the notes, or techniques and tools about how to import information from the presentation into the .org-file.
 When I google this, I mostly find tips about _writing_ a presentation using org-mode. Instead I&#x27;m looking for tips that could be e.g. (some obvious/general examples): The notes should...
  
Reference the presentation (with it&#x27;s title, file location, author, origin) 
 E.g. through a link to the file.

                    <span>I&#x27;m doing literate programming and ran into a bug using source blocks. Just in case it was my setup, I validated this using Portacle with emacs-lisp as the language.
 Parens are matched correctly
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Open paren in the string is no problem
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 The addition of an escaped-quote breaks matching.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( \&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Double escape closes the string early as expected and results in illegal syntax.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello (\\&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 I could not replicate in lisp-mode major.
 Any ideas? Should I take this to #IRC? Is this org-babel or some other component?

                    <span>So I’m pretty new to scala. I’m building a greenfield application and need to solve my CRUD problem. 
 I’d like to bring a bit of the functional paradigm to CRUD operations. 
 “Find all case class objects in table that pass function, apply this function to update”
 You get the idea. Sorry if my terminology is off anywhere and please correct. 
 My requirements are: 1. Nothing experimental, this is an enterprise application 2. Readability 3. Leverages functional expressiveness
 4. You have personally used it before and have lived with its growing pains. 5. Compatible with SSMS
 Frankly there are so many options and I’m overwhelmed, could use some help narrowing down the field.

                    <span>As a scala data engineer, I normally write some ETL projects and bigdata projects using Spark.
 I learned about functional programming lately and got to know about Cats.
 I see cats is very useful in the aspects of dealing with NullPointer Exception as well as providing higher abstraction for Try, Option, Eigher, Future classes.
 My question is, unlike some other program like web, which is not allowed to crash on runtime, data engineer&#x27;s job allows programming crash and sometimes it&#x27;s more desirable for me to fail fast so I can know what&#x27;s wrong immediately. I don&#x27;t need my data job to run all the time and finally I can only find it&#x27;s wrong in the log.
 With that in mind, I found the Try, Option, Either, Future seems not so useful to me. Because if I use them, I had to use some option.get
 or either.left.get
 to get the method result, which seems rather unnecessary. Otherwise, the program never fail.
 In my company, people don&#x27;t know Cats, but they can carry out their data development normally.
 So is my above perspective right? Please correct me if anything wrong in my thinking.

                    <span>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a MCMC sampling algorithm which proposes new states based on the simulation of Hamilton’s equations of motion.
One of the main ingredients of this algorithm is its integration scheme — how the equations are discretized and its solutions found.
The standard choice for this is the classical leapfrog.
In this blog post we present our empirical investigation of U7U_7U7​ — an algorithm that is computationally more expensive, but also more accurate.
This trade-off is not a simple one (after all, more precision implies less tries), but our explorations show that this is a promising algorithm, which can outperform leapfrog in some cases.
We don’t suppose previous knowledge of integration methods, but in case you are new to HMC or MCMC methods, a good starting point…</span>

                    <span>Hi all, is it possible to use synctex with an org file? So for example I&#x27;d like to do forward search (whilst in org file find corresponding place in pdf), and reverse search (whilst in pdf find corresponding place in org file). The closest I can currently get is to add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \synctex&#x3D;1 to the org file which gets me reverse search in the pdf and be directed not to the org file, but to the intermediate tex file that org creates when compiling org to pdf. 
 I feel like org to pdf bidirectional linking should be possible in 2021. To me this is pretty much the only thing holding me back from using orgmode for all pdf generation.
 Many thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently found the Google Maps feature that allows you to save places and organize them into lists (e.g., restaurants you have been recommended), and then choose to show in the map or not the places in a given list. I find it really useful and would like to start using it more, but I don&#x27;t think those lists are a good way to organize a large amount of places, and have some privacy issues with Google Maps. I would rather use org-mode to organize them, and then export them whenever I want to some other open maps application, or maybe keep them synchronized automatically. Do any of you know of something that implements this or something similar?

                    <span>I have the following two tables:
 | ! | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 | | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 
 The only difference between these tables is that the first has named columns while the second doesn&#x27;t. For both tables, I can calculate values in the last column one at a time by doing M-x org-table-recalculate or C-c *, but iteratively updating the table using M-x org-table-iterate or C-u C-u C-c * only works for the second table. For the first table, if I run org-table-iterate, I get the message &quot;Table was already stable.&quot; Is this a bug, or am I not understanding how named columns are supposed to work?
 I am running Org 9.4.6 and Emacs 27.2 on Windows 10
 Update: I posted this question on StackExchange and someone pointed out the following from the Org manual. So it turns out I didn&#x27;t understand how named columns work 😄
  
The documentation (C-h i g(org)Advanced Features) says: 
 Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the table with ‘C-u C-c *’ only affects rows that are marked ‘#’ or ‘*’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself. The column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

                    <span>Hello scala friends, I have been writing small programs using scala and also learning along. I am looking to expand to building REST API with persistence. Eg: bookstore. I am also learning about functional effect. I have a tiny REST application using scalatra + slick + docker. What is the common stack in practise?

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a Scala amateur and I was reading a PR which contained ExclusionRule() in the build.sbt and I am trying to understand what is the purpose of these rules and the effect of transitive dependencies on a project. Is there a top-level dependency, and if so, if you exclude the dependencies of that top-level dependency won&#x27;t it be broken? Or does it come into play if there is an upgrade in the future? 
 Resources, documentation and personal anecdotes and experiences are all welcome. Thanx.

                    <span>For example for Unit
  
The Unit type has a single inhabitant, called unit. It represents values with no computational content.
  
What does &quot;inhabitant&quot; mean in this context? What does it mean to say that unit is the &quot;sole inhabitant of the Unit type&quot;?
 I&#x27;m completely clear on what it means for a function to be a method of a typeclass, for example, but Unit is a data type so this isn&#x27;t that.

                    <span>So I have a list which contains tuples, List[(String, String, Option[Int]). More tuples have the same first element. I want to check for all the tuples with the first same element that the third element meets some criteria for all of them, and then put the first element in a new list. How would I go about with this? I am only beginning with Scala so it&#x27;s hard to even reason about this.

                    <span>Hi - I can update a value for a mutable.Map using the &#x27;update&#x27; function/method whereas immutable.Map doesn&#x27;t have it so I tried somethin like this,
 mymap(i) &#x3D; mymap(i)+1
 but that didn&#x27;t work. Alternatively converting the map to a mutable map also did not work for me,
 ....mapValues(somefunc).to(mutable.Map) //didn&#x27;t work
 I&#x27;m using scala version 2.12
 Edit:
 I&#x27;ve put the code below and here are the issues,
  
the &#x27;mapValues&#x27; method is deprecated in 2.13 and unfortunately the scala api doc doesn&#x27;t give any hint on what otherwise I can use
 As per the comments &#x27;to&#x27; factory method exist only in 2.13 version but not in 2.12
 &#x27;update&#x27; won&#x27;t work on immutable map.
 no direct way to create mutable map from an immutable map
  
Not sure what lies ahead in Scala 3 version, I guess having hints and example usage on each API is what will make my future learning easy. 
 def countTriplet(arr: Array[Long], r: Long): Long &#x3D; { val aft &#x3D; arr.groupBy(identity).mapValues(_.length) val bfr &#x3D; new mutable.HashMap[Long, Int]() var cnt &#x3D; 0 var i &#x3D; 0 while (i &lt; arr.length - 1) { val n &#x3D; arr(i) if (bfr.contains(n / r) &amp;&amp; n % r &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &amp;&amp; aft.contains(n * r)) { cnt +&#x3D; bfr.getOrElse(n / r, 0) * aft(n * r) } if (bfr.contains(n)) bfr.update(n, bfr(n) + 1) else bfr.put(n, 1) // aft.update(n, aft(n) - 1) // this won&#x27;t work i +&#x3D; 1 } cnt }

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am working with a Java API from a data vendor providing real time streams. I would like to process this stream and write using Akka streams.
 The Java API has a pub sub design and roughly works like this:  Subscription sub &#x3D; createSubscription(); sub.addListener(new Listener() { public void eventsReceived(List events) { for (Event e : events) buffer.enqueue(e) } }); 
 I have tried to imbed the creation of this subscription and accompanying buffer in a custom graph stage without much success. Can anyone guide me on the best way to interface with this API using Akka? Is Akka Streams the best tool here?
 Edit: I was able to get a solution on stack overflow here.

                    <span>I know that ZIO test has its own mocking setup, but I am not sure how well it works to mock dependencies that aren&#x27;t ZIO services, such as a 3rd party SDK. He is my situation:
 I have a service that depends on the Firebase Admin SDK, specifically the auth module. So the live layer looks like a ZLayer[Has[FirebaseAuth], Throwable, Has[UserService]]. I&#x27;d like to mock the Firebase Auth SDK for testing, but I don&#x27;t want to use the annoying emulator thing they have, it&#x27;s too heavyweight and I don&#x27;t want to deal with running another Docker container.
 UserService wraps around the auth SDK but has some custom logic. For example, UserService.getUserByEmail(email: String): Task[Option[UserId]] returns an effect that returns Some(UserId) (UserId being an internal domain object) if a user with this email exists, None if no user with the email exists, and fails if it was unable to complete either of these. In contrast, FirebaseAuth.getUserByEmailAsync(email: String): ApiFuture[String] returns a Java Future which fails with a specific error if a user with the email doesn&#x27;t exist.
 For example, for mocking FirebaseAuth&#x27;s getUserByEmail, I&#x27;d like to do something like (pseudo-code):
  when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email1)) return Future.succeed(&quot;userid&quot;) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email2)) return Future.fail(NoSuchUserException) when (auth.getUserByEmailAsync(email3)) return Future.fail(BadEmailException) 
 and use this somehow in my ZIO-test of my UserService.
 I can&#x27;t find any examples of using Mockito in ZIO test. Does anyone have a code snippet they can share, or if this is better done through ZIO-test&#x27;s own mocking system (I only saw mocking of ZIO services there so I am not sure if it can do more than that), can you explain how to do it?

                    <span>Someone asked a help question on Emacs help list, and I thought I had a nice simple solution. How wrong :-).
 The problem:
 Given a list with values, increment all values by one.
 some 34 word 30 another 38 thing 59 to 39 say 10 here 47
 So, I thought, let&#x27;s just put in a table and incement column:
 | some | 34 | | | word | 30 | | | another | 38 | | | thing | 59 | | | to | 39 | | | say | 10 | | | here | 47 | | #+TBLFM: $3&#x3D;&#x27;(apply &#x27;1+ &#x27;$2);N&#x27; 
 However, when C-c C-c, i get &#x27; (apostrophes) filled in instead of values. Why? :)

                    <span>I am having a really hard time searching up information for this stuff, google does NOT like to index scala documentation that isn&#x27;t horribly out of date it seems.
 Can I use the fewerBraces feature in a newer version of scala? Is it likely to become a fully fledged feature or is it abandoned? How can I, in general, find out about these things?

                    <span>Hello!
 Quickly: My goal is to use the new org-cite citation format for org-exports to ox-hugo and LaTex.
 I didn&#x27;t use the org-ref style of citations and org-export workflow so I don&#x27;t know how this would work normally.
 I get citations to get exported but can&#x27;t figure out how to have them exported in the style I want and with a bibliography.
 If someone could point me to a definitive tutorial or their config files + a test org-mode file that would be great!

                    <span>org-emphasize is almost usable, it works perfectly fine for single line markers, but is useless the moment one deals with multiline regions.
 This is basic functionality in essentially any text editor, but aside from regexing it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to simply append a specified character to the beginning and the end of every line in the region. Org-emphasize, evil-surround-region, facemenu or make-face, no bueno. Either they outright don&#x27;t work because of font-lock, for good reasons, or they have half-functional functionality and put it at the beginning and the end of the region, not every line.
 Does anyone know how to achieve this functionality? I did try this but it didn&#x27;t work either. Having to use regex is not ideal.

                    <span>Just wondering: Is it possible to org link (e.g. file or id or headline) between org files and headlines and have those blog links converted by ox-hugo to link between the files in Emacs.
 For instance, let&#x27;s link or headilne A to org file B and convert both to pages on Hugo. Is there a native method or hack to link the Hugo page of headline A to the Hugo page of file B to one another using org-mode links?

So this solution would take me back to the old Zettelkasten concept: each note has a UID, and I refer to the note by that UID. Period.

                    <span>I recently discovered exporting your org files to html. Someone developed a very helpful theme package [here](https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes] which renders just like ReadTheDocs.
 I&#x27;m trying to be better about code documentation and would like to use this for my current contract. It needs to be hosted locally. I was thinking of using this to convert my literate programming org docs into something my client can browse.
 The license here is GPL3
 Can I use this project to render the documentation for my client&#x27;s commercial, proprietary code? How can I comply with this license and is there any possibility that it can interfere with my client&#x27;s IP or legal responsibilities in any way?
 I&#x27;m an open-source guy but unfortunately that&#x27;s not how I make my living. If I cannot use this, can anyone point me to the typical workflow?
 EDIT: The author of this project seems very open to resolving licensing issues. For anyone else considering this excellent project, see the relevant issues on GitHub. Personally I&#x27;m going to be cautious since I&#x27;m not working on a personal project.

                    <span>Hi,
 Just tried org mode and it&#x27;s taking over my life .
 I am writing every documentation with it.
 I am trying to replace the markers with &#x60;o&#x60; to get something like this:
 ​
 markers replaced
 And sometimes I just want to insert a single line of code and I hope to get this approach:
 ​
 markers line return omitted
 Any Idea please?

This code is pretty contrived and currently not compiling, but I&#x27;m just trying to get comfortable with ps syntax and hopefully this gives you an idea what I&#x27;m trying to accomplish.
 What I&#x27;d like to be able to do is
  
Take my duderrr &#x3D; MyDude {b: true, i: 77, s: &quot;hellotest&quot;, c: &#x27;x&#x27;}
 Pass it to succeedOddFailEven
 Given that param i is currently 77 and odd, succeedOddFailEven should return Right (Tuple &quot;hellotest&quot; &#x27;x&#x27;)
 However if i is changed to an even int such as 78, succeedOddFailEven should return Left (Tuple true 78)
  
Problem is, @ -style deconstruction mydude@(MyDude rec) doesn&#x27;t seem to be working? Getting this error but not quite sure how to interpret it.

                    <span>As the data science and machine learning fields have grown over the past decade,
so has the number of data pipelining frameworks. What started out largely as a
set of tools for extract-transform-load (ETL) processes has expanded into a
diverse ecosystem of libraries, all of which aim to provide data teams with the
ability to move and process their data. Apache Airflow, Beam, Luigi, Azkaban — the list goes on and
on.
As users of several of the above frameworks, Tweag has a special interest in
data pipelines. While working with them, we have observed a few common
shortcomings which make writing and debugging data pipelines more complex than
it needs to be. These shortcomings include limited
composability of pipeline components, as well as minimal
support for static analysis of pipelines. Thi…</span>

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just getting started with the ZK system. I have a question about numbering: I get that the numbering sequence should proceed 1  2  2a  2b  2b1  2b2 etc. according to whether notes are roughly related to one another. If I had a note that wanted to insert between 2 and 2a in that sequence, because I thought it was very closely related to 2, how would I label it (or perhaps it doesn&#x27;t really matter and I&#x27;m overthinking it and should just stick it in as 2c )?
Thanks!</span>

                    <span>Well :( once again need help building a project. I swear I&#x27;ll get better at this...
 Trying to build this game following the instructions in the Local Install section:
  
git clone https://github.com/sharkdp/cube-composer.git
 cd cube-composer
 npm install
 bower install
 gulp
  
All goes well until I ran gulp. Here&#x27;s the gulp output. Just my own analysis, looks like there&#x27;s three things going on
  
36 warnings of deprecated features. However these shouldn&#x27;t be blockers for the build, correct?
 22 errors referring to the wrap and unwrap typeclass functions not being implemented. Are these blockers? If so, how did this ever work in the first place and how should I fix? I&#x27;m seeing many (but not all) of these errors coming from bower_components/ which was simply the tool in step #4 above used to build the project, and not from the project itself. Should I try rebuilding without bower? Any recommendation on what to run to do this?
 Then it seems to continue compiling before failing completely with a traceback at the end.
  
Would love any advice on how to build this. What do I need to do please?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m writing my second piano sonata.  Currently I have pages and pages of hand-written music on sheet music. I&#x27;m curious if anyone knows of any markdown-native ways of encoding the notes into a more searchable format than a picture.
The two snippets are here for those curious. https://soundcloud.com/bradford-fournier-135979011/sets/piano-sonata-2-brief-snippets
This is about the length of each sheet snippet that I&#x27;d like per note.

                    <span>On the zettelkasten subreddit I came across a post linking to an article on the method (shared by the author of the article). In it he was making some bold proclamations, so I thought I&#x27;d ask what this community thought?
The core argument seems to be

  
Today, however, I shall provide one fundamental component of Luhmann&#x27;s system. This fundamental component is missing from an estimated 96% of digital zettelkastens.
Luhmann outlines this fundamental component in the very beginning of his paper on how his zettelkasten works.

    
Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: &quot;this or something else.&quot;

  
  
You see, built into every single note in Luhmann&#x27;s system is one requirement: he must decide where the note belongs. It forces associations, and associations stand as the fundamental building block of human memory. One must decide if the note is associated with this or something else. It is a comparative schema built into the very root of Luhmann&#x27;s antinet zettelkasten, which surfaces the magic of his system.
Unfortunately, this fundamental component is watered down to near extinction in the world of digital zettelkastens.


(Source: https://daily.scottscheper.com/num/243/)
The idea of &quot;must decide where the note belongs&quot;, while true, misses the point of multiple context within the zettelkasten, as Luhmann was trying to come up with an alternative to filing notes using folders. Or is he just rehashing the classic Folgzettel Debate?

I want to use tags not only to specify the content of a Zettel but also the type of the Zettel itself. It is like a meta-information. e.g. I want to categories the type of content like this
:typ:idea
:typ:permanent
:typ:bib
:typ:index
:typ:keywords
:typ:quick_n_dirty

Question 1
Question 2
problem that the : does not work out of the box with zetteldeft. So I look for something else because I do not want to modify the default settings.</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone,
I usually take a ton of notes from narrative non-fiction books I read: story ideas, research etc... Those should be considered &quot;literature notes&quot; in the context of zettelkasten. I find it confusing having these notes in a single file, so I split them by topic or anecdote. But I don&#x27;t like to have my computer crammed with tons of files. When I read a new book on the same topic, rather than creating new notes and linking them, I tend to group the notes I already have with new notes who adds info to the same topic or details to the same anecdote. Still, I keep a reference to the original source (in the form of citation).
To better explain what I do:
I read a book about a writer and I take a note on an episode of his life (which we&#x27;ll call NOTE 1).
Another episode of his life goes to a different note (NOTE 2) in the same folder.
I read another book and I find some detail on the same episode as NOTE 1. I don&#x27;t create a new note but I add it to NOTE 1 and eventually add a citation for the new source.
I read a book about a chemist and I take a note about one of his discoveries in the specific folder of that book/project. It isn&#x27;t directly related to the episode of NOTE 1, but I think linking them can bring to a new perspective. I create NOTE 3 and link NOTE 1 and NOTE 3.
Is that a good practice, or is it better to have a single file for the notes coming from a book, then different super short notes for concepts I want to keep from each book?</span>

I do not understand the concept of backlinks. What is it and how to use it?
From the meaning of the word I would assume that a &quot;backlink&quot; would create a 1to1 relation by default.
But in &quot;B&quot; is a new and automatic created link (back) to &quot;A&quot;, too.

                    <span>Every now and then I come across a situation in which I need to transform a sequence of elements, say a List, but the transformation isn&#x27;t independent for each element and I would need to keep additional state during the loop to perform the transformations I need.
 Let me try to give a simple example. In C# I could write something like
  private static List transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs(List list) { bool done &#x3D; false; var result &#x3D; new List(); foreach (var elem in list) { if (!done &amp;&amp; elem is SomeType) { result.Add(transformElement(elem)); done &#x3D; true; } else { result.Add(elem); } } return result; } 
 My naieve attempt at achieving this in PureScript currently looks as follows.
  transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs :: List ElemType -&gt; List ElemType transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs elems &#x3D; reverse (loop elems).result where loop :: List ElemType -&gt; { done :: Boolean , result :: List ElemType } loop &#x3D; foldl (\{ result, done } elem -&gt; case elem of SomeValueConstructor t -&gt; { result : SomeValueConstructor (if done then t else transformValue t):result , done : true } _ -&gt; { result : elem:result, done }) { result : Nil, done : false } 
 But it feels like it could use some improvement. Is there an idiomatic way to do this kind of thing?

                    <span>I suck with dependency stuff :( Nothing ever seems to work and I can never seem to understand why. I&#x27;m trying to spago build this tictactoe game. What I&#x27;ve done so far is spago init and added a few dependencies to spago.dhall, which now looks like this
 , dependencies &#x3D; [ &quot;console&quot; , &quot;effect&quot; , &quot;prelude&quot; , &quot;psci-support&quot; , &quot;debug&quot; , &quot;css&quot; , &quot;arrays&quot; , &quot;integers&quot; , &quot;maybe&quot; , &quot;tuples&quot; , &quot;halogen&quot; , &quot;foldable-traversable&quot; ] 
 Running build again I get the following errors: https://pastebin.com/cUutNNn4
 What, why? Debug.Trace comes from package debug and Halogen.HTML.CSS comes from package halogen, both of which I have there.
 What do I need to do please?
 Is there any tool that can take a look at the import statements used in a project and solve the dependencies based on that?

 import Prelude import Effect.Console (log) import Effect.Unsafe (unsafePerformEffect) debug :: forall a. String -&gt; a -&gt; a debug msg &#x3D; snd $ unsafePerformEffect $ log msg snd :: forall a b. a -&gt; b -&gt; b snd _ b &#x3D; b 
 This would then be used as follows
 myFuncBeingDebugged a b c &#x3D; &quot;test: &quot;  show a # debug $ someOtherFunc $ b c bla... 
 Are there ways to improve the debugging experience? (I&#x27;m using VSCode if that matters)

If you are a coder, I know you have many other things on your busy schedules, but I&#x27;m asking if you&#x27;d take a couple of minutes to look at my coding attempt and offer whatever help you want. Even just pointing me where or what to look for would be a great help.

Announcing Evoke, a GHC plugin for deriving type class instances quickly by Taylor Fausak
I’m excited to announce Evoke, a GHC plugin that automatically derives type class instances without using generics or Template Haskell.
Deferred Derivation by Matt Parsons
Freeing a module from Template Haskell speeds up our build tremendously - not because Template Haskell is slow (it’s very fast) but because compiling at all is slow. The best way to speed something up is to spend 0 time doing it — don’t do it at all!

                    <span>I am interested in developing an application with pursecript that would work with diagrams drawn by the user. I&#x27;m looking for a library/package that would provide the drawing functionality for me to minimise development time. I&#x27;m thinking of functionality somewhat like Microsoft Visio (e.g. place shapes, connect shapes, move shapes, autorouting of connectors etc.). 
 Are there any libraries/packages either natively or wrapped in purescript? Failing that, are there any suitable javascript libraries I could use through FFI?
 Everything I&#x27;ve found myself is either a dead project, intended for data display (i.e. graphs), static (i.e. closer to MS Paint than Visio) or contains too much functionality (e.g. more general rendering libraries for games or multimedia). I&#x27;d rather not roll my own if I can help it :)
 Any help or advice you could provide would be appreciated.
