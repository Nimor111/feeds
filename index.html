                              <span>Async programming in Emacs is... challenging. If the modern asyncio/await/async paradigm represents &quot;cooperative&quot; multi-tasking, Emacs&#x27; async seems more &quot;semi-cooperative&quot;.
 I&#x27;m working with async process output in a comint mode, and I (re-)read the following docs often (emphasis added):
  
Output from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when reading terminal input (see the function waiting-for-user-input-p), in sit-for and sleep-for (see Waiting for Elapsed Time or Input), in accept-process-output (see Accepting Output from Processes), and in functions which send data to processes (see Sending Input to Processes). This minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel programming.
  
So it&#x27;s pretty clear that sit-for and accept-process-output are good &quot;yield points&quot; (ala await). But what about in functions which send data? Does that mean:
  
Only functions which directly call process-send-*?
 Any function which calls such a function (and so on up the call stack)?
  
And where exactly in such functions which send data can process-output interrupts happen? Anywhere? Only specific places? If you&#x27;ve been down this road and found any enlightenment, I&#x27;d be grateful to hear about your travels.

                              <span>I&#x27;d be grateful for any help with a problem I&#x27;ve had for a while. When I close Emacs, I always make sure to save every open buffer before I do so -- it&#x27;s an automatic reflex. Thus, the saved version of any given file will be the most current, and there should not be any need for autorecovery unless Emacs crashes without getting to save. Sometimes however, even after a normal close, my Emacs claims that a file has auto-save data, and prompts me to recover the file. If I recover the file and run a diff on it, I can see that the &quot;recovered&quot; file is actually an out-of-date version.
 Has anyone else encountered this, and could there something wrong with my config that&#x27;s causing Emacs to try to &quot;recover&quot; out-of-date files? Below are the lines that I think could be relevant from my config:
 (setq version-control t) (setq vc-make-backup-files t) (setq auto-save-interval 20) (setq kept-old-versions 0) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq backup-by-copying t) (setq kept-new-versions 10) 
 Right now I&#x27;m on Emacs 28.2 on Apple M1, but I think this has been a problem I experienced on a past Linux machine as well, so I suspect the fault is with my config.
 Thank you!!

For people wondering what the parsing capabilities of tree-sitter will be, or maybe hacking on or planning for some emacs modes to make use of it, I found the very helpful tree-sitter playground. Pick your language, enter some test code, click around. It&#x27;s really impressive.

                              <span>I was using emacs-mac because it has precise text selection when using a mouse. But I like just about everything more building with emacs-plus, seems much more stable being closer to source. So I am using emacs-plus now but when selecting text with a mouse, it is quite imprecise. It will show you have characters selected while clicking down and when you release the click it will often add one character more to the selection. Is there any setting to fix this or is it more low level that a build has to fix it like emacs-mac did? Thanks!

 Every answer online regarding this issue tells me to copy glut32.dll to either my System32, my SysWOW64, or the same directory as the .hs file. I&#x27;ve done all three, but no dice.
 Why could my machine still be failing to utilize the .dll&#x27;s I&#x27;ve downloaded? Is there some extra step I&#x27;m missing?

 λ&gt; :set -XDataKinds -package fixed-vector λ&gt; import Data.Vector.Fixed as V λ&gt; import Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed as UV λ&gt; v &#x3D; V.fromList [4,1,2] :: UV.Vec 3 Int λ&gt; V.any ( V.any (&gt; 99) v True 
 The &#x27;all&#x27; function from that package works just fine so any condition I need I can reverse the logic and use that so the issue isn&#x27;t preventing me from getting anything done, but this seems like a bug to me so I thought I would ask here if anyone could see a good reason for this behavior. The source code for these functions calls C code, so there may be some funny business going on with that.
 I&#x27;m on GHC version 9.2.4 and I&#x27;m not specifying the version of the fixed-vector package, so I assume it is the most recent.

                              <span>I have a collection of items, e.g. a list of number, and an expensive operation. I want to pre-compute the operation for each of the items, so I can do cheap lookups repeatedly. For example:
 expensive :: Int -&gt; Int expensive &#x3D; (!! 1000000) . iterate (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral . (^2)) getAt :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Int getAt pre_computed index &#x3D; pre_computed !! index main :: IO () main &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [5,2,4,6] pre_computed &#x3D; map expensive xs for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt pre_computed) 
 That works as expected. Initially numbers are printed slowly but then fast later on.
 Now, I thought I can combine the pre-computing- and the lookup function into a single function like this:
 getAt :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Int getAt xs index &#x3D; pre_computed !! index where pre_computed &#x3D; map expensive xs main :: IO () main &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [5,2,4,6] for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt xs) 
 But this doesn&#x27;t work. Printing the numbers is always slow. My intuition was, that after partially applying getAt, it pretty much looks like this
 getAt&#x27; :: Int -&gt; Int getAt&#x27; index &#x3D; pre_computed !! index where pre_computed &#x3D; map expensive [5,2,4,6] 
 and then laziness makes sure that pre_computed is only computed once. After thinking about it more, I guess pre_computed is a local variable and not shared cross getAt calls. But shouldn&#x27;t Haskell be able to see that pre_computed does not depend on any of the arguments and optimize that away somehow?

                              <span>I know emacs isn&#x27;t supposed to be super snappy, but it is ridiculously slow, to the point where I&#x27;m convinced that I&#x27;ve done something terribly wrong. It&#x27;s just a little slow on startup and gets progressively worse and is borderline unusable after about half an hour.
 All my packages are natively compiled. (From nix) I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with haskell-language-server. It&#x27;s also bad with rust-analyzer, but not as bad. It affects all versions I&#x27;ve tried, including latest master and the lsp-mode experimental fork (which improved stuff but broke direnv, so...) I&#x27;ve tried the default gc limit, a high limit, a manual idle timeout and gcmh. It&#x27;s much snappier in the terminal, but still not as good as I want it (and the whole gui thing was the reason I tried to switch away from neovim).
 So now I&#x27;m convinced that there&#x27;s no way you all live with this and that I must&#x27;ve done something really stupid.
 Here&#x27;s (the relevant parts of) my config: https://github.com/SKyletoft/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs https://github.com/SKyletoft/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/configs/language-specifics.el

                              <span>I started undergoing the process of rewriting my existing config with use-package and straight.el, but I cannot get straight to install packages. Neither :straight t, nor setq straight-use-package-by-default works and Emacs complains about a bunch of missing definitions when compiling init.el (I know this is somewhat expected, but it happens with extremely simple to load packages, like company). I&#x27;m using GNU Emacs 28.2-r4, if that matters.

                              <span>This post may end up rambling a little but I&#x27;ll try to keep it short.
 I decided to try doing a vanilla Emacs config again; I usually use Doom. I&#x27;ve tried this before with moderate success, but I felt like starting from scratch would be refreshing and allow me to craft things more carefully.
 I made a concerted effort not to add things I don&#x27;t understand fully or that I will never actually use. I also decided not to use evil or try to ape all the Doom keybindings like I did with my previous attempt.
 Fast forward to today; the result is this.
 I&#x27;m actually quite satisfied with it; the code meets my goals of consisting of fully self-contained use-package statements, which in my inexpert opinion is a nice way of making the code as stable and idiot-proof (me) as possible.
 There&#x27;s one problem…</span>

                              <span>I just upgraded from Fedora 36 to Fedora 37, and when I tried executing emacsclient, it would immediately crash. emacs-nox worked fine however.
 I removed the binary and tried re-installing emacs from the Fedora package repository, but the same thing would happen.
 I then tried recompiling emacs-28, and I get this cryptic message when running ../configure:
  config.status: error: cannot find input file: &#x60;test/manual/noverlay/Makefile.in 
 Google-fu gives exactly one hit when searching for test/manual/noverlay/Makefile.in and it&#x27;s for someone having trouble compiling emacs on Apple M1; in my case I&#x27;m using boring intel x86 (thinkpad x480).
 I&#x27;m not really sure where to begin to look to debug exactly what&#x27;s going on. For what it&#x27;s worth, when trying to compile emacs-29, I can get past the configuration, but when I actually try compiling it, it&#x27;s tells me I&#x27;m missing a ton of object files, namely, the following:  scroll.o category.o chartab.o com.o cmds.o casetab.o region-cache.o doprnt.o lcms.o systhread.o terminfo.o lastfile.o  Has anyone had any issues with emacs on Fedora 37? This only seems to be the case on my thinkpad; on my desktop it&#x27;s running fine.

                              <span>For the smooth integration I am using Cygwin (with w32 Emacs for native UI + copy/paste). But its fork is slow, especially with corporate antivirus.
 In the past I used NT Emacs with Cygwin and in order to make hg work I created an executable wrapper that re-invoke the command stripping .exe extension:
 https://hg.defun.work/utils/file/tip/cygwin/cygrun/cygrun.c
 Because hg is a Python script in Cygwin! And this is not enough: I set CYGWIN&#x3D;&quot;noglob&quot;, otherwise braces are removed from expression --template {rev}, see https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/cygwin/2011-11/msg00225.html
 Now I face the same issue with MSYS2: hg is a Python script so Windows apps (фтв ТЕ Уьфсі ші) cannot directly call it... What would you do to marry NT Emacs and MSYS2?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have something like this in my doom emacs config.el file:
 (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; entry &quot;* Section 1\n** Section 1.1\n* Section 2\n&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%.org&quot; &quot;#+title: %\n&quot;)))) 
 And this will pre-write the &quot;* Section 1\n** Section 1.1\n* Section 2\n&quot; string into every new daily capture that I make. 
 I would like to use a template file instead of this, so that every time I capture a daily it will pre-write whatever is in some &quot;template.org&quot; file. 
 I have searched everywhere for an answer but I can&#x27;t seem to find any.
 I appreciate any help

                              <span>Kinda short version: I use docker-compose for local development with JS and TypeScript. Decided to experiment and move everything into docker - nothing mounted from the host or running on the host except emacs. Got that working, thanks to docker-tramp. Projectile, magit, eglot, lsp-mode — all of them run. It feels super snappy. eMacs codespaces, minus the browser.
 HOWEVER my bliss lasts few minutes as very quickly I get “forbidden reeentrant call” error from tramp and eglot runs out of sync and gives me irrelevant errors. This is caused by some change tramp did for eMacs 28. There are tickets for this explaining in detail, but both lsp-mode and eglot haven’t resolved it (and it may be company-mode bug). I’m not expert on tramp and lsp, so debugging that would be big effort investment for me.
 Anyone using lsp server + tramp on daily basis and have dealt with this?

                              <span>When I start org agenda, it positions the cursor on the first entry, rather than on today&#x27;s date. I then press. to go to today. One extra step, but cumbersome when opened many times a day. I have (add-hook &#x27;org-agenda-mode-hook &#x27;(lambda () (hl-line-mode 1))) which currently highlights the line with the cursor. I would like to position the cursor on today&#x27;s date in org-agenda on startup.

 Who should apply?
 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (3 to 5 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
 Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (3 to 5 per month).
 Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.

                              <span>[Rookie Servant question]
 Hi all! I&#x27;ve got a REST API in Servant with a resource (/resA/:id) and many subresources (/resA/:id/resB/:id, /resA/:id/resC/:id, etc.) and a database that stores information on which users have access to which resources. I&#x27;m using basic authentication to authenticate users.
 I want to restrict access to the subresources of resA so that one only can access e.g. /resA/1/... if one has access to resA/1. Currently I do this by manually checking for access in every endpoint handler under resA, which doesn&#x27;t feel like a good solution since this check must be added for every new endpoint I add under resA.
 This should be a common scenario for real world APIs, but I haven&#x27;t found any documentation explaning how to deal with this. Any advice on how to propely restrict access as described above with Servant? Can this be done at the type level, or can I somehow check for access &quot;outside&quot; of the endpoints&#x27; handlers?
 Happy to be directed to any blog posts / documentation about this!

                              <span>Im currently struggling a bit with the data type:
 My assignment is to build a data constructor that basically works like a tupel, but on a tree. I need to build a data constructor for a tree that has ANY number of children per Node.
 (&quot;Give the definition of an algebraic data type GTree for trees in which each inner node can have any number of children and describe your procedure.&quot;)
 I already built one with e.g. 3 children per Node: But how do I build any number of children (not 4, 5, or 10 but ANY at the same time). Thanks in advance and have a nice christmas.
 data GTree a &#x3D; GNil | GNode a (GTree a) (GTree a) (GTree a) deriving Show testGTree &#x3D; GNode 4 (GNode 5 GNil GNil GNil) (GNode 6 GNil GNil GNil) (GNode 7 GNil GNil GNil)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning Yesod, and I&#x27;ve gotten to the section on Authentication and authorization. I&#x27;ve been trying to set up a minimal example according to the book, but it&#x27;s resulting in a timeout:  HttpExceptionRequest Request { host &#x3D; &quot;accounts.google.com&quot; port &#x3D; 443 secure &#x3D; True requestHeaders &#x3D; [(&quot;Content-Type&quot;,&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;)] path &#x3D; &quot;/o/oauth2/token&quot; queryString &#x3D; &quot;&quot; method &#x3D; &quot;POST&quot; proxy &#x3D; Nothing rawBody &#x3D; False redirectCount &#x3D; 10 responseTimeout &#x3D; ResponseTimeoutDefault requestVersion &#x3D; HTTP/1.1 proxySecureMode &#x3D; ProxySecureWithConnect } ConnectionTimeout 
 I tried using yesod-auth-oauth2 instead, but I still got a timeout error:  HttpExceptionRequest Request { host &#x3D; &quot;www.googleapis.com&quot; port &#x3D; 443 secure &#x3D; True requestHeaders &#x3D; [(&quot;Content-Type&quot;,&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;),(&quot;Authorization&quot;,&quot;&quot;),(&quot;User-Agent&quot;,&quot;hoauth2&quot;),(&quot;Accept&quot;,&quot;application/json&quot;)] path &#x3D; &quot;/oauth2/v3/token&quot; queryString &#x3D; &quot;&quot; method &#x3D; &quot;POST&quot; proxy &#x3D; Nothing rawBody &#x3D; False redirectCount &#x3D; 10 responseTimeout &#x3D; ResponseTimeoutDefault requestVersion &#x3D; HTTP/1.1 proxySecureMode &#x3D; ProxySecureWithConnect } ConnectionTimeout 
 Trying with the Python Flask version on Google&#x27;s website for the same OAuth works, so I am wondering if YesodAuth is broken. I am using LTS 20.3.

                              <span>background: i want to make a game and do so with minimal effort there are some options to do so i chose gi-gtk for all menus and cairo to draw anything more complex, gtk has a class called builder which uses a xml file to make a user interface in this file you can specify the name of handlers for signals so i created a simple main.ui which had a button and in this button i added a signal handler.
 first time i ran it complained that there wasn&#x27;t a signal handler for the click which makes sense as my function is not a c global symbol.;
 i then used addCallbackSymbol to add my function as a signal handler however when i do so although it does call my function it also causes a segmentation fault.

                              <span>Hi folks!
 Noob question here - I have some time data in the following structure:
 - Time column in the format: &quot;&quot;%FT%TZ&quot; - ie. &quot;2022-08-12T16:00:00Z&quot; (always UTC)
 - Timezone column in the format: &quot;America/New_York&quot;, etc
 And I need to parse that into a &quot;ZonedTime&quot; and later convert it to other timezones (using the same timezone format) - ie Europe/London.
 I couldn&#x27;t find a package to do so and the tz formats in the Time package seem to be the three letters only (as far as I can tell...)
 Is there any way of doing so in the time package I&#x27;m not seeing? or any other package to do so?

                              <span>Hello
 I&#x27;m studying Haskell at the moment and stumbled upon a program I wasn&#x27;t sure how it worked. It involved the following the lambda expression:
 data Server &#x3D; MkServer Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) data Report &#x3D; MkReport Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) map (\(MkServer domain emails) -&gt; MkReport domain (filter ((/&#x3D;) domain . emailDomain) emails)) 
 I am aware about how lambda expressions work, but I&#x27;m unsure about:
 1. how this lambda expression spawns two arguments for map
 2. the dot is a function composition but how exactly is it applied in this case?
 3. on what arguments is filter applied?

Is there any way to get xref jump to definition working with imenu as a backend so I can just use M-. instead of having to manually search the imenu?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get emacs to automatically use the Agda input mode whenever I load an Agda file. I currently have the following in my config.el: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (add-hook &#x27;agda2-mode-hook &#x27;(lambda () ; If you do not want to use any input method: (message &quot;DEBUG setting Agda method&quot;) (set-input-method &#x27;Agda) ))
 &#x60;&#x60; TheDEBUGmessage appears in the Messages buffer, so the hook is running, but any time I open a new Agda file, the input mode isnil, and I have to manually callset-input-method&#x60;.
 Is this the wrong way to set the input method for a specific mode? If not, is there a way to debug this, so I can see why the input method isn&#x27;t getting set, or if something is un-setting it?

                              <span>At the end of the year, I am happy to announce the stable Vertico 1.0 and Marginalia 1.0 releases. Vertico is a minimalist, yet flexible and responsive vertical completion UI. Marginalia provides helpful annotations for many completion contexts. Both packages have been solid for a while but I rather let things mature slowly. These releases finally put the stamp &quot;stable&quot; on these two packages. I expect the other members of the package suite to follow soon after. Both packages have been updated recently to support the newest Emacs 29 features. They are compatible with Emacs 27, 28 and the upcoming 29.
 I got a lot of positive and constructive feedback over the last two years and the packages have seen some growing adoption in the community. This is all very encouraging. I learned about many different subsystems and packages through your feedback and given the ubiquity of completion in Emacs. Thank you, Emacs community!
 If my packages make your daily Emacs live better, please consider sponsoring me on GitHub Sponsors. I plan to develop and maintain my packages in the long term. I am the author of Vertico and Marginalia is co-authored by /u/oantolin and me. Take a look at minad&#x27;s sponsor page and oantolin&#x27;s sponsor page.
 If you have questions or feedback I am happy to hear!

 My first implementation of yaml-pro used an elisp yaml parser which was really slow. In the latest version of yaml-pro, I&#x27;ve re-implemented all of the features to use the new Emacs tree-sitter integration. Not only was it much easier to implement, but the resulting code also runs much faster and can handle syntax errors. Also, I was able to get eldoc and imenu support in using tree-sitter.

                              <span>I have installed multiple cursors and have these bindings:
 ; Multiple cursors
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-c C-S-c&quot;) &#x27;mc/edit-lines)
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-&gt;&quot;) &#x27;mc/mark-next-like-this)

 If I select a word and use mc/mark-next-like-this, then all instances are selected and multiple cursors appear. I can delete multiple instances like this, but when I try to type new text, only one cursor flashes and the typed text appears only at the first cursor. What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>I am getting &quot;Package cl is deprecated&quot; on EMACS startup.
 cl is not directly called in my init.el file, so one of my packages must be calling it.
 I found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RVUxjGymcY0 which says to use
 (require &#x27;loadhist)
 (file-dependents (feature-file &#x27;cl))
 To identify the culprit.
 I am using EMACS 28.1 with ESS. It is unclear to me how to evaluate these commands. I can get loadhist via &quot; ‘C-h v load-history’ &quot; but then I do not know how to evaluate
 (file-dependents (feature-file &#x27;cl)).
 ​
 I am sure this is a noob question, but any help would be great.

The URL is: https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token&#x3D;nil. elpa gives me the following dependencies: oauth-20130128.151, htmlize-20210825.2150, markdown-mode-20221105.236. I read https://billisalive.tumblr.com/ and https://danzorx.tumblr.com/post/36832512247/a-weird-oauth-el-issue-when-trying-to-set-up but couldn&#x27;t get tumblesocks to work :/ 
 Anyone else experiencing the same? Google doesn&#x27;t provide much.

 I follow that with my options and an org-mode time stamp, as follows:
 
 I noticed however that there is also a #+date: option. Why would I want to use this instead of a simple timestamp, and what would the format need to be?

What I expect from framework is to be similar to pytest. And definitely I against writing unit tests in Markdown like in Buttercup as: there is no Lisp completion for such unit tests out of the box and highlighting. By all means maybe there are any plugins fixing this issue with Markdown code blocks but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best option to utilize markdown as a unit test source.

 As you can see, the lsp-ui tooltip uses this ugly font rather than my preferred font. How can I fix this? I can&#x27;t find the face which dictates the lsp-ui tooltip.

I can&#x27;t seem to find documentation for how to enable this online, but ive seen videos where people using slime have it. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, so I&#x27;ve been trying to solve this problem all day, I&#x27;m learning about connecting to databases in scala and I&#x27;ve got stuck. My colleague who is tutoring me has no problem running this on his laptop with the postgres db in a docker container. Yet mine won&#x27;t load the config file for some reason.
 I have a basic tutorial example that I did thankst to RTJVM and that works fine, but it is very basic and just connects. Here however, no such joy. 
 So far, the docker container gets spun up, and the database table with correct columns and headers gets created, but for some reason it then fails to write to the database. I can&#x27;t see anything in the logs, I just have this stack trace and I can&#x27;t read it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to say much:

                              <span>Hi there, It seems that I am running scala 2 in intellj when I&#x27;m supposed to be running scala3, but I have no idea how to choose between the two is there a way to do it easily. I just don&#x27;t know enough about java to know if this is a big rebuild of just a switch somewhere, I know I have both here on my Mac, that I&#x27;m certain of, but going from one to the other, I&#x27;m not so sure about. 
 Any pointers or docs that would explain it would be appreciated,

If you can’t hold an entire idea in your mind, crystal clear and ready for manipulation and expansion, then you haven’t broken it down far enough yet.


Matt summarizes &quot;atomicity&quot; beautifully in this essay.</span>

                              <span>A new maintainer for org-caldav has been found and a big update was published this week to sync tasks/todo&#x27;s:
https://github.com/dengste/org-caldav
With this, you can have your plain text todo files and appointments (in Emacs + org-mode) and sync with a proper Calendar service/app -- e.g. &quot;make stuff appear on your mobile devices&quot;. Then you can also have your regular Calendar app prompt you to get going before appointments by all the buzzing and beeping you&#x27;d usually expect. The origin of the information is outside of your calendar app, though, in Emacs. Which may or may not be your cup of tea 
You can now, from the &quot;&quot;&quot;comfort&quot;&quot;&quot; of Emacs and your org-mode files, sync all this stuff to a &quot;CalDav&quot; server. That means: basically every mail + calendar server, including Google&#x27;s, though I&#x27;ll be trying iCloud and Nextcloud.
The tool exports all your .org info to iCalendar files (.ical) and then syncs these with a server. It&#x27;s a two way sync, so you also get new entries for calendar events you&#x27;ve created.
At the end of the process, org-caldav acts as a bridge between your plain text stuff and your normal Calendar + Todo stuff.
Apple users beware: don&#x27;t expect this to &quot;just work&quot; with Reminders, though. From work, I know that the Reminders app is basically a glorified hack. I&#x27;ll report back when I find out anything substantial about this.</span>

Haskell and C++ FFI for Fun and Profit by Topi Kettunen
Lately, I’ve been banging my head against the wall with the FFI of Haskell since I wanted to write a particular piece of code in mainly Haskell, but I needed something from the world of C++.

                              <span>One common complaint from industrial users of Haskell is that of compilation times: they are sometimes painfully slow. Some of that slowness is difficult to avoid—no matter how you slice it, typechecking and optimizing Haskell code takes a lot of work—but nobody would argue that there is not ample room for improvement. For the past few months, Krzysztof Gogolewski and I have had the opportunity to work with Mercury to identify what some of those improvements might be, and I am pleased to report that our first major patch toward that end will be part of GHC 9.6.
For readers who just want the numbers, we’ve seen a 2–3% reduction in compile times and a 5–10% reduction in allocations, on average, for unoptimized builds,1 measured on a few large Haskell codebases. Due to the nature of the patch…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Since around a month I started to have horrible performance with AucTeX + Helm and I have no idea how to debug it. I am on Windows 10 using native Emacs 28.2.
 After a minute or so of opening a TeX file and enabling AucTeX any helm command slows down to a crawl. Even the standard &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;helm-M-x&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; takes ages to update (approx 2 sec per keypress), typing quickly leads to dropped letters, etc. 
 This happens ONLY with AucTeX. I tried profiling but the profiler does not work as expected. Below is the result of runnning the profiler for 2 minutes! It has 1 sample. This never happened to me. How should I debug this?

                              <span>At work we are using RHEL 8. I do not have root access. I have asked and will not be given root access. RHEL 8 has emacs 26.1 installed and I want to use a more up to date version.
 The platform does not have most of the source libraries installed. The configure step of compiling emacs from source fails due to a variety of missing dependencies. Each time I try to build one of them, another one is missing. This seems like a deep rabbit hole to go down that will take a lot of time.
 Is there a way to statically link the emacs binary when building on another machine and move it over to the RHEL8 machines? 
 Is there any other way to get a more modern version of emacs on these machines?

                              <span>Good morning,
 I have a situation where I&#x27;d like to automate something with TRAMP but my Elisp-fu is pretty weak. I can kinda read it and usually figure out what&#x27;s going on, but that&#x27;s a bit different from getting the thing to work.
 We have embedded development units with a little miniature network inside them for communications. I need to do dired (and ultimately file editing, but dired is a fine jumping off point) on files on the second hop. The second IP address is always the same, however the first can vary within our local network, and depending on which box we&#x27;re shelling into. So for example a working argument to dired looks like:
 /plink:root@10.20.20.5|ssh:root@192.168.1.1:/ 
 And this will give me the directory at the root filesystem on the second hop. The 192.168.1.1 address is always the same (it&#x27;s inside the box) but the 10.20.20.5 might vary at the 5 depending on which box, and which IP address DHCP picked up that day when it powered on.
 Ideally it would just interactively ask me for the first address and then execute dired on the full string as I&#x27;m fine with using that as a starting point for editing the scripts and whatnot that end up on the machine.
 Anyone Elisp fluent who might point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance. I&#x27;ve read a lot on the Elisp programming manuals and such, but getting from the language to doing something functionally useful more than basic addition or something has eluded me thus far.

                              <span>I have customized the variable org-agenda-custom-commands as shown below. Currently, the classic approach &quot;General tasks (simple version)&quot; and my custom approach &quot;General tasks (complicated version)&quot; both do the same thing (and this works well). What I&#x27;m trying to do is that I would like the whole section &quot;General tasks (complicated version)&quot; to be gone if there are no NEXT/WAIT tasks in the associated file (notes.org).
 The problem that I have is that once the variable org-agenda-custom-commands is evaluated initially (when Emacs launches), the if block decides if the section will be displayed or not. Further changes to notes.org will not change the behavior of org-agenda-custom-commands since its if block has already been evaluated. However, manually re-evaluating org-agenda-custom-comma…</span>

                              <span>I flip between any number of window manager workspaces and any one of those workspaces could have an Emacs frame and a browser. When asking elfeed or Org Mode to open a link in a browser, it sure would be nice if I could have any browser sharing the workspace with the current Emacs frame handle that URL! As it stands now, the URL will open in a tab in whatever was the last browser window that had focus and that could be on any of, like, 10 workspaces.
 Anyone solved this problem? Or have any thoughts about how one might solve this problem?
 My guess is that its going to require some interactions with the window manager in order to query the applications in the current workspace and then find a brower. In this case the WM is i3wm.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;v been using vterm for a while now, and I just discovered what &quot;directory tracking&quot; is. How I understood is that Emacs should be aware of what directory I&#x27;m currently inside in vterm, so   should by default show the files in the current directory---but it&#x27;s not working!
 I&#x27;ve followed the steps shown in the README: sh vterm_printf() { if [ -n &quot;$TMUX&quot; ] &amp;&amp; ([ &quot;${TERM%%-*}&quot; &#x3D; &quot;tmux&quot; ] || [ &quot;${TERM%%-*}&quot; &#x3D; &quot;screen&quot; ]); then # Tell tmux to pass the escape sequences through printf &quot;\ePtmux;\e\e]%s\007\e\\&quot; &quot;$1&quot; elif [ &quot;${TERM%%-*}&quot; &#x3D; &quot;screen&quot; ]; then # GNU screen (screen, screen-256color, screen-256color-bce) printf &quot;\eP\e]%s\007\e\\&quot; &quot;$1&quot; else printf &quot;\e]%s\e\\&quot; &quot;$1&quot; fi } vterm_prompt_end() { vterm_printf &quot;51;A$(whoami)@$(hostname):$(pwd)&quot; } setopt PROMPT_SUBST PROMPT&#x3D;$PROMPT&#x27;%{$(vterm_prompt_end)%}&#x27;  I have the above at the end of my .zshrc; but it is simply not working.
 Do I need some additional setup in the Emacs side, or did I correctly understand what &quot;directory tracking&quot; and it is not working for me?
 While writing this post, I began to suspect that maybe ivy is messing things up?
 Thanks!

 Following up on my recent talk at EmacsConf (youtube| toobnix| Q&amp;A), we are prototyping a new economic system in the open source community, and your participation is essential!
 What: The First Congress for Attribution-Based Economics. In a nutshell, we will be meeting to appraise participating open source projects as a result of which any financial contributions to these projects will be fairly distributed to contributors and antecedents according to the proportions of value that we agree on.
 When: Let&#x27;s pick a good day - please take the poll here: https://forms.gle/LD7RAjRAdTGoBFJBA
 Where: Online at this gather.town (no signup necessary): https://app.gather.town/app/aoo9sjeCeRnN1dhu/abe-congress
 We&#x27;ll meet by the fountain.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about why (fringe-mode 2) is so relatively slow. It adds about half a second to my init time. My solution is (run-with-idle-timer 1 nil (lambda () (fringe-mode 2))) and works well enough for my needs, but I don&#x27;t understand why removing fringes would take so long? Edit: to be clear, I mean that just putting (fringe-mode 2) on the init file is slow. The solution with the timer was to delay the execution until after init.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running emacs29 built with brew like this:
 brew install libgccjit
 export CC&#x3D;gcc
 brew install emacs-plus@29 --with-native-comp --with-xwidgets --with-no-frame-refocus --with-modern-pen-icon
 I run it on my Mac with M1 arm cpus. Sometimes on the laptop, and sometimes connected to an external monitor. After a round or two of these switches, Emacs fonts start to look ugly, see this pic for the contrast (the top window is a fresh emacs, while the bottom one has been through monitor switches).
 Has anyone seen the same problem, and more importantly found a solution for it?

                              <span>I was searching for some examples of rx usage and came cross this blog post http://francismurillo.github.io/2017-02-15-Project-Script-Loader.
 It mentions these functions -
 projectile-project-p, projectile-project-root, project-project-name and locate-dominating-file.
 I&#x27;ve been needing these functions and even forgotten how much I need them.
 On the site there is also this - http://francismurillo.github.io/2016-08-02-An-Unique-Projectile-Completion/, which has an implementation of something I&#x27;ve always wanted in find-file, displaying the file name before the path.

                              <span>Sorry it might be a silly question, but I&#x27;m thinking of buying Macbook air M1, 16g ram and 1tb ssd, just because I like the gold color and I&#x27;m on my budget.
 I used to be a Scala developer back then but the last shop used (horrible) window vm machine with 64gb ram, and it was extremely slow, especially when compiling.
 Now i&#x27;ll probably get a job from Scala world again soon but I&#x27;m worried that macbook air is ok for scala development or not.
 Probably the future employer will give me whatever machine they have but maybe I need my own machine if I work as a freelancer.
 One extra monitor is Ok but if I need to use docker or something then M1 air might not be enough.
 If M1 air is not tolerable, then I will probably get a Macbook Pro.
 Any advice or thoughts? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have the following question on the List Monad that does a filtering while unboxing in the do notation.
 Here is an example ... unboxing the list returns only the sublists with 2 members, thus rejects all other sublists with length not 2
 f :: [[Int]] -&gt; [(Int, Int)] f xss &#x3D; do [a, b]  f [[2, 2], [3], [4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]] [(2,2),(4,5)] 
 If I desugarize the do notation I have to use a case statement explicitly to pattern match on the list length and use the &#x27;fail&#x27; like this
 f :: [[Int]] -&gt; [(Int, Int)] f xss &#x3D; xss &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \xs -&gt; case xs of [a, b] -&gt; return (a, b) _ -&gt; fail &quot;not two members&quot; 
 So my question is where does Haskell hide the magic that [a, b] &lt;- xss should use a case with a fail?
 Any ideas or help is appreciated.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a relatively small cabal project and I use GitLab CI for a runner inside my university&#x27;s GitLab instance for automated builds, tests, haddock generation and finally haddock hosting on GitLab pages. The whole process is based on one of the official haskell dockerhub images. This seems to be a clean and well-defined pipeline and it works fine.
 Recently I needed to add a pandoc library dependency to my cabal file which led to pipeline runtimes of more than 30 minutes. What&#x27;s the cleanest way to accelerate this? Is it possible to let my CI pipeline depend on a different image with pandoc (the library, not the executable) pre-installed? Using the same image but with &#x60;RUN cabal install pandoc&#x60; didn&#x27;t help, my &#x60;cabal build&#x60; just tells me again it needs to build it.

                              <span>If I understand the new GHCJS backend correctly, it diverges from the normal compilation pipeline at STG (see the new StgToJS module subtree). Wouldn&#x27;t that make it an excellent candidate to use GHC-WPC&#x27;s machine-readable external STG representation, instead of hooking it directly into the GHC source tree?
 Beside decreasing the maintenance burden on GHC, this would also give Cabal/Stack support to GHCJS for free; whereas GHCJS as-is doesn&#x27;t support either yet. 
 Now, of course, maybe there are changes to GHC that are needed even before STG (after all, the GHCJS commit does touch other parts of GHC), but those would be fairly lightweight without the rts and StgToJS parts, and maybe could even be a good opportunity to generalize them for other future alternative backends.

(ie. lots of meetings set in other timezone&#x27;s format and an individual bouncing timezones kinda quickly)
 Longer Tale I&#x27;ve been bouncing between several time zones lately and its made some of my scheduling in org-mode a bit problematic w/o timezones. At the moment, I guess standard timestamps are set as . However, I need to start having org understand TZs and make sure org-agenda is aware.

                              <span>I have switched over somewhat recently to org-mode with the goal of going all in on it for my productivity. 
 I&#x27;m following a few of the staples in my learning journal (norang and voit). It&#x27;s all been great but I am trying to wrap my head around project management of more complex personal projects. Namely my tabletop game design. 
 Long story short I&#x27;m trying to build up a workflow for my designs that incorporate some literate design files among other things. The ultimate goal of these projects are to be go from ideation to publication
  
Ideation
 Prototyping
 Playtesting 
 Development
 publishing
  
As a result these will be multi-directory many file projects. I&#x27;ve also been learning webdev on the side and have been using projectile to manage those projects.
 To all the expert org-mode users here, do you see any issues or pitfalls with trying to pair org-mode and projectile? Below is a rough outline of how I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use it. 
 I think I&#x27;ll probably use several org files for the project itself but have 1 project management file. 
  
Project.org - the file for tasks and scheduling playtests. This would be the file added to my &quot;org-agenda-files-alist&quot; and captured into my normal agenda views etc. 
 README.org - git overview
 Design.org - main design doc
 Design-Journal.org - notes I capture along the way for publishing a post-mortem
 Playtests.org - Playtest data
 Rules.org - official rules document used for playtesting and eventually publishing

I&#x27;d be happy if you check the translation and see if I screwed something up.
The priority of the translation is accessability of his thoughts. So, I did aim for a compromise of adhering to Luhmann&#x27;s style and styling the grammar to a more accessable way. Luhmann is exeptionally difficult to read and translating doesn&#x27;t help..
German differs more from English than one might expect:

  
French is a fine park, Italian a big, bright, colorful wood. But German is almost a primeval forest, so dense and mysterious, so without a passage and yet with a thousand paths. You can&#x27;t get lost in a park, and not so easily and dangerously in the bright Italian wood; but in the German jungle, within four, f…</span>

                              <span>Good morning, I am new to Haskell and just recently started learning it. I have been stuck on an error for 3 days and can&#x27;t seem to resolve the error. I was hoping someone from this community could help assist me, I have looked at a lot of examples but still don&#x27;t understand why. I come from C# with 6 years of experience under my belt, irrelevant but I am not completely new to programming.

 Error
 ghci&gt; :load ListExercise1.hs [1 of 2] Compiling Main ( ListExercise1.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. ghci&gt; :script ListExercise1.hs ListExercise1.hs:1:1: error: * No instance for (Show ([Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool)) arising from a use of &#x60;print&#x27; (maybe you haven&#x27;t applied a function to enough arguments?) * In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it | 1 | doesListContainElement :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 Code
 doesListContainElement :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool doesListContainElement list element &#x3D; element &#x60;elem&#x60; list main :: IO() main &#x3D; do let myList :: [Int] &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 99] let contains :: Bool &#x3D; doesListContainElement myList 2 if contains then putStrLn &quot;True&quot; else putStrLn &quot;False&quot; 
 Do all functions within a monad must return the type of that monad? 
 Edit: Include load as part of the error message.

                              <span>I am quite new to the FP so this Could be a stupid question. Please pardon if so.
 Is there a way to have multiple implementations for the same function in Haskell? So the compiler can pick the optimal one depending on the architecture of the hardware.

                              <span>In the blog post announcing the merge of the JS backend into GHC, there is a &quot;Hello World&quot; example but in my opinion it&#x27;s been simplified beyond the point of usefulness. What I mean by that is that it shows a program with a main :: IO () but I can&#x27;t imagine ever wanting that. What you&#x27;d want to do is write some functionality in Haskell that is then used from a web page.
 For example, I&#x27;d like to compile a library that exports a function run :: ByteString -&gt; IO Int. If I compile it with GHC&#x27;s new JS backend, I get a bunch of .o and .hi files; I assume the .hi files are &quot;real&quot; .hi files and the .o files are some GHCJS-specific format. If I try to make a dummy main &#x3D; pure () that imports my library, then I get a 13M JavaScript file with no obvious entry point to call run from the outside.
 So what would a similarly simple example look like, that exports a, let&#x27;s say, foo :: Int -&gt; IO Int instead of a main :: IO (), that can be called from other JavaScript code?

 Failing that I will follow a path similar to xmonad, but I&#x27;d rather not give up on my idea of drop-in plugins.

I&#x27;m currently stuck on part 1 of [D16Y22](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/16). My solution works fine for the sample input, but my answer is too low for the real input. My code can be found [here](https://github.com/EthanWelsh/aoc2022/blob/main/src/Days/Day16.hs).
 Does anyone have any tips or suggestion as to where I might be going wrong? I would also appreciate any more general feedback as to how my code could be improved.
 Thanks!

It could be helpful either directly for working on web pages or with WASI for running on Kubernetes or similar applications. Do you know any use case, for example, in your company, that could benefit from this project?

                              <span>I am really excited to try emacs-29 but my principal work machine is a 2020 MBP with an Apple Silicon M1 chip. My everyday emacs is 27.1 which I installed through homebrew, and that seems to be the updated version. The usual sites that have pre-built binaries for the Mac (e.g. emacsformacosx.com) are still on 28.2.
 After some searching I found a few recommendations for emacs-plus:
 brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus brew install emacs-plus@29 --with-native-comp --with-modern-doom3-icon 
 Unfortunately that did not build on my machine and I have run out of options to try and trying to figure out the different issues. It does apparently work on some machines, but the explanations and workarounds have not really revealed themselves as far as I can tell.
 I may just need to be patient, but I thought I would ask in case anyone has a tip or trick that they could share. I&#x27;m just very interested in experimenting with the new SQLite functionality.
 Thanks and regards.

 There is a way to only eval this code:
 &#x60;(add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((js-mode typescript-mode) . (eglot-deno &quot;deno&quot; &quot;lsp&quot;)))&#x60;
 If the project has a &#x60;deno.json&#x60; file?

                              <span>Hey-o. I&#x27;m quite happy using my standard Emacs keybindings. But when I need to assign a new key binding for a single command, I suffer from having too many options.
 So what are your strategies for choosing sensible keybindings?
 I&#x27;ll start - I&#x27;ve found function keys to be invaluable when wanting to enter a package with its own menu. F3 for org-agenda or F8 for deft. It may be an obvious application of the function keys, but it was a pattern that I had to independently discover.

 I&#x27;ve been reading that a lot of people are moving from company to corfu. Have you been able to make this work for lsp-mode ? If so, any configs/snippets I can look at.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I took the plunge and upgraded to emacs29. Smooth so far, just having trouble getting tree-sitter to work.
 I&#x27;ve downloaded and generated the libraries for the various languages from:
 https://github.com/casouri/tree-sitter-module
 Then I copied all of them from dist to /usr/local/bin, and set the treesitter load path, and checked that tree-sitter can see them
 (require &#x27;treesit) (treesit-available-p) ;; t (setq treesit-extra-load-path &#x27;(&quot;/usr/local/lib&quot;)) ;; open a javascript document to test. (treesit-ready-p &#x27;javascript) ;; t 
 My javascript document only has the JavaScript (major?) mode, but I&#x27;m not getting any error messages or anything when I type invalid statements.
 Is there something I&#x27;m missing? Do I also need to install the tree-sitter package and enable (global-tree-sitter-mode)?
 Where is tree-sitter-hl-mode in the native implementation?

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to run and get the result of a command on a remote host with SSH connection, after having activated a virtual env.
 In a terminal, I usually do
 local $ ssh remote remote $ source venv/bin/activate remote (venv) $ midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid 
 How can I do the same in Emacs, with a single command? Ideally, I would like to get the output of the commands as well.
 After reading the documentation of TRAMP, I decided that start-file-process or shell-command would be the functions I need. I tried this.
 (let ((default-directory &quot;/sshx:remote:~/&quot;)) (start-file-process &quot;tramp-remote&quot; (get-buffer-create &quot;*Tramp remote process*&quot;) &quot;/bin/bash&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;source ~/venv/bin/activate ; midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid&quot;)) 
 But nothing appears in the buffer &quot;Tramp remote process&quot;. There are many other commands for running a program in Emacs, like call-process, process-file, etc, but I am a bit lost in which can be used here.
 Thanks for help!

                              <span>Anyone that uses windows, would you mind sharing your experience with emacs running natively, not using a vm or wsl. Is there any significant performance differencece in comparison to that on a unix system. 
 Expect auctex, haskell mode and markdown-mode + a theme i don&#x27;t use any other packages, so i think there wouldnt be an issue package-wise.
 Any input on the subject is well appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a fast typist, and I can feel there is a lag in typing and responsiveness in Emacs. I know it&#x27;s probably a package or something I&#x27;m doing that&#x27;s causing it, but where do start tracking this down? I don&#x27;t mind it when I&#x27;m writing code, but it&#x27;s a bit distracting when I&#x27;m typing prose or a journal.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using global-auto-revert-mode which updates a buffer automatically when it is changed externally. But if there is any unsaved changes in the buffer and the file is modified externally there is not even a message letting me know it is modified so I can be making changes and don&#x27;t know it is modified until I try to save. Is there a way to change this maybe to be more vim-like? Or is there a workflow here that I&#x27;m not understanding. Thanks.

 (defun flymake-tldr-lint--setup-keybindings (local-set-key (kbd &quot;M-t a&quot;) &#x27;flymake-tldr-lint-remove-broken-all)) 
 But when I start Emacs if fails with Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Malformed arglist: (local-set-key (kbd M-t a) &#x27;flymake-tldr-lint-remove-broken-all)&quot;). It&#x27;s not clear for me how to fix this keybinding.
 flymake-tldr-lint-remove-broken-all is my own function.

                              <span>When I started using Emacs I was following the setup outlined by System Crafters, which I still think is a really good introduction. But, over the last few months I&#x27;ve started to replace packages with more &quot;minimalist&quot; or &quot;stripped down&quot; packages. I&#x27;ve switched from Ivy and Counsel to Vertico and Consult, and recently I switched from company to corfu for auto-completion. 
 I think a lot of members of the Emacs community have done the same. My question is what package have you replaced with a more &quot;minimalist&quot; package in your emacs config? What were the major factors that made you decide to switch?

                              <span>I have customized my org-mode to have a variable pitch font by default, but fixed-pitch font for text in a org-block, that is text between #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC. As expected, when one specifies a language emacs and babel already know about this works as well
 However, when I use an &quot;external&quot; language (for example Nim via the ob-nim package) emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize the block as a src-block face and it uses the variable-pitch font and I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;m stuck on this problem 
 I have checked the package is installed correctly and I have loaded the package correctly, since I can run and eval code blocks using C-c C-c with absolutely zero problems 
 Here&#x27;s some screenshots for emacs-lisp, working 
 working! fixed pitch + highlighting
 and for nim, not working 
 variable pitch :(

                              <span>In the thread &quot;Fallback Search for Zettels...&quot; from @micahredding, @Will presents another Keyboard Maestro macro. It&#x27;s really impressive, but I don&#x27;t like Keyboard Maestro at all. I checked it out and it kind of overwhelms me. Same to Alfred, by the way.
I prefer the keep-it-simple approach. When I want to link to a file somewhere on my filesystem, I do the following:
I add a unique ID to the end of the filename, e. g. This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf
Wherever I want to link to this file, I simply write: [This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf] or something like: see the paper I wrote once [20221220090709]
To follow the link, I simply copy the UID to the search in Finder which only takes seconds.  The UID allows me to change the filename later without breaking the link. Using single brackets make these links distinguishable to &quot;real&quot; links within the zettelkasten. The UID has two digits more than my normal zettelkasten UIDs which is another criterion for differentiation (and it allows me to rename more than one file per minute).
I have been doing it this way for a couple of months now and it has been working so far. What do you think of this approach?</span>

It&#x27;s an infinite (AFAIK) canvas application with some drawing/annotation features common on iPads, some shape and vector features common in Pages/Keynote, live collaboration (their big selling point), images and file attachments.

This is focusing about collaboration and multi-device usage:

I was interested in checking out how well the file stuff performs.
Can this be a digital desktop for writing projects? Or the current project workbench?
Anyone here using that?
My own experience

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work for me: I can drag and drop Markdown files onto the canvas, but only as embedded copies. This makes sense for sharing/collaboration. But I&#x27;d personally want a digital desktop that merely links to my files so I can continue to edit them in The Archive. (Insert sad panda picture here)</span>

                              <span>The Nickel team is delighted to announce a new version of Nickel, 0.3.1.
Nickel is a programming language that helps people write configurations
that are modular, correct and boilerplate-free.
If you haven’t tried Nickel for yourself, you can learn how to get started on
the website.

What’s in Nickel 0.3

LSP record &amp; standard library completion
The Nickel language server (nls) now supports autocompletion for the Nickel
standard library, as well as for the fields of user-defined records.
This significantly improves the experience of writing complex configurations
in any editor with LSP support. It also increases discoverability of existing
standard library contracts and functions, as simply typing record. or
array. will now show a list of all exported fields.

 It seems like org-tables don&#x27;t allow such a structure?

                              <span>I recently was showing my 6 year old daughter a handful of basic lisp snippets when she got interested in what I&#x27;m doing at the computer all day - and she was somewhat interested. While thinking about how to entertain her on the upcoming trip to the grandparents in a few days I remembered turtle graphics from when I was small.
 A quick search revealed that Ray Puzio indeed implemented turtle graphics in emacs - with the sources uploaded to emacsturtle.metameso.org back in 2014, but the page is long gone. The talk should be enough to piece it together - if I had enough time before the trip, and this wasn&#x27;t such a last minute idea.
 Does anybody reading here accidentally happen to have an old copy of turtle.el?

                              <span>Hello, I want to customize the key combinations to enlarge the window. I already customized to enlarge and enlarge horizontally with C-s- and C-s-. But now I want it to be smarter. I mean, depending on the position of the window, I would like to call other arrows to make the window larger or smaller.
 Any ideas to start?

                              <span>I used to use vim and now I wanna try out emacs, why you may ask? The only reason being emacs is a gui application and it can display all kinds of stuff.
 The purpose of this post is for me to get a basic setup going, some configuration that is small something like kickstart.nvim from vim world.
 As I’m new to emacs world I don’t have any idea on how to configure it, I’m well versed with vim motions and I have heard about some evil mode, it would be really helpful if you guys can guide me through in setting up emacs as my LaTeX environment.
 You get the idea - vim motions - minimal config - LaTeX setup

 For now I disable this package, but I really miss the magit highlighting. I created github issue, but it has no updates since 3 weeks, so maybe community could found the solution?

                              <span>Hi!
 I have been searching for packages that allow me to define custom data types. My shopping list of features is:
  
Generates a constructor function
 
Generates getters and perhaps even setters for the data type.
 
The fields defined have auto completion when constructing. Preferably it&#x27;s scoped so that you don&#x27;t get all fields of any data type ever defined in your auto completion results.
 
Option to require the data type to be fully populated or not. Preferably this would trigger an error during macro expansion.
 
 cl-defstruct is the closest I have found to having all of these features. Are there any more that I have missed in my search?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello OrgMode community,
 ​
 I am an avid org-mode user and I love it. I am willing to invest a lot of time into tinkering with my system so it works just as I like it.
 I have, however, not hit an obstacle that I cannot overcome:
 ​
 I have an org file with the #+latex_class: property set to a custom class called &#x60;handin&#x60; that I have created for myself. I am using new latex commands in that class, e.g. &#x60;\moduleshort{Machine Learning Fundamentals}&#x60; that I calling in my org files as follows
 #+latex_header: \moduleshort{Module Title} 
 These are now, however, also used by the latex preview process and cause normal formulae to be rendered with those command&#x27;s arguments above, like this:
 ​
 Latex preview of the fragment when latex_header is not commented out.
 ​
 The black text is the argument I am using for one of the commands. I have to use those commands in the latex header section before \begin{document}, so changing this is sadly not an option.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea on how to get the latex preview process to ignore those additional header lines?
 ​
 Right now I can only manually comment out the latex_header: lines when I am not exporting, and then comment them back in when I export...

                              <span>Hi!
 I am wondering if I could get some help with my capture templates.
 I am trying to implement a flow where I capture something from the web using org-roam-ref and then immediately add a link to the captured doc in the current clocked task.
 The two templates look the following way
 To add the ref to the current task: elisp (&quot;art&quot; &quot;ToRead Ref - Current&quot; plain (clock) &quot; - [ ] %a\n&quot; :immediate-finish t) 
 To capture from the web with org-roam
 elisp (&quot;Rt&quot; &quot;ref&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}&quot;) :unnarrowed t :immediate-finish t :after-finalize (lambda () (org-capture-string &quot;&quot; &quot;art&quot;) )  
 The ToRead Ref capture template is used, but %a is empty. I&#x27;ve tried adding using
 elisp :after-finalize (lambda () (progn (org-store-link) (org-capture-string &quot;&quot; &quot;art&quot;))  …</span>

                              <span>I tried to do something like this. 
 #+PROPERTY: header-args :results value #+NAME: get_property #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var name&#x3D;&quot;&quot; :results silent (org-with-point-at org-babel-current-src-block-location (org-entry-get nil name t)) #+END_SRC * Example :PROPERTIES: :test: &quot;test&quot; :END: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes :exports both (message &gt;) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : test 
 It works great, but when I try to export it in any format, i get nil instead of test
 https://preview.redd.it/oxt3kuogbt6a1.png?width&#x3D;1260&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;78d928ec6ac1966bbc6b965b05455d906d16f782
 Although, If i put get_property lower, then it works as expected.
 #+PROPERTY: header-args :results value * Example :PROPERTIES: :test: &quot;test&quot; :END: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb yes :exports both (message &gt;) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : test

 Could somebody explain me, what I am doing wrong? 
 I don&#x27;t wanna use :var header, because I would like to see the value of variable in the export and not it&#x27;s name. 
 Of course, I can use noweb like this
 #+NAME: print_b #+begin_src sh :var b&#x3D;1 echo -n $b #+end_src #+begin_src sh :noweb yes echo &quot;&quot; #+end_src 
 But it would be more convenient to use properties for that.

#development #growth #continuity #feedback
Discontinuous development processes can also be explained by continuous processes. Or rather based on them. Namely, if critical masses are reached by continuous growth, which introduce a new level of complexity. The critical mass is then a value, from which positive feedback effects occur. A slowdown comes about by the fact that the limits of a negative feedback or a saturation are slowly reached.
This is one of my older notes (from Feb. 2012)
It is understandable but pretty unrefined.</span>

The space doesn&#x27;t show up in the HTML printout but it is annoying to deal with and makes it so the code doesn&#x27;t run. I was wondering if this is a known issue?

                              <span>Org table works great, but when the data gets big enough, table functions get slow because it has to parse the entire thing every time. So could I use org columns instead? Is there a way to get table like functionality out of it?
 An example is sum a column. Like every entry has data in that property, can I get a sum of that? Or do arbitrary code of the org properties? I suppose it&#x27;s org mode and Emacs, so of course I can, but I&#x27;m looking to see if anyone has done it.

 Lost in your computer
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 With a heart full of todos
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 Trying to make sense
 Of the tasks on my plate
 In this digital defense
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 But I can&#x27;t help but feel
 Like I&#x27;m falling for you
 In this digital world so surreal
 You&#x27;re just a mouse click
 But to me, you&#x27;re so much more
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 But I can&#x27;t ignore
 The way my heart races
 When I open up in Emacs
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 But I can&#x27;t help but feel the same
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 But I can&#x27;t help but feel
 Like I&#x27;m falling for you
 In this digital world so surreal
 You&#x27;ll never lose track again
 You&#x27;ll never forget again
 With org mode by your side
 You&#x27;ll never lose your mind again
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 But I&#x27;m all you need
 To keep your life organized
 And your tasks complete
 I&#x27;m just a org mode file
 But I&#x27;ll never let you down
 With org mode by your side
 You&#x27;ll never lose your way
 You&#x27;ll never lose track again

 My concerns for learning it are:
  
I heard Org mode is pretty good but how does it compare to vimwiki?
 
You can do a lot of computing stuff in emacs like checking emails and stuff, but is it practical / more efficient in emacs than doing it via GUI?
 
How does Emacs Lisp compare to vimscript / lua?
 
Are there any other features emacs has that neovim does not?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m profiling my init.el with ESUP and unfortunately I can&#x27;t find a bottleneck. It&#x27;s just a sum of small pieces that makes it overall ~3.2 seconds.

 UPDATE
 It turns out I had ensure, but not defer, set globally. So lazy loading was actually off! Thank you to those who pointed that out. Here&#x27;s the NEW ESUP output, which still takes 2.29 secs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a shell-session-mode to be able to create org-mode source blocks similar to GitHub Flavored Markdown&#x27;s:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;console $ command output more output $ another command output ... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 All I want is for the $ commands to be colorized. I haven&#x27;t created an emacs mode before so I&#x27;m following https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14885670/create-a-new-mode-in-emacs and of course the Emacs Lisp info pages.
 However when I try to use the mode in org mode&#x27;s source block:
 #+begin_src shell-session #+end_src 
 I immediately get the error in the Emacs mode line:
 Org mode fontification error in # at 22 
 I can&#x27;t seem to invoke a debugger at this error. Using (setq debug-on-error t) seems to have no effect.
 Here is my shell-session-mode.el file:
 ;;; shell-session --- Markup shell commands with their output. ;;; ;;; Commentary: ;;; ;;; Colorizes blocks similar to &quot;console&quot; in GitHub Flavored Markdown ;;; which is defined as &quot;ShellSession&quot; in ;;; https://github.com/github/linguist which uses the regexp in: ;;; https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript/blob/master/grammars/shell-session.cson ;;; ;;; Code: ;;; ;;; Include this in your .emacs init file: ;;; ;;; (require &#x27;shell-session-mode) (defcustom shell-session-prompt-regexp (regexp-quote &quot;^[^[:space:]]*$[[:space:]]+[^[:space:]]+$&quot;) &quot;Regexp matching a shell $ prompt with a command.&quot; :type &#x27;regexp :group &#x27;shell-session) (define-derived-mode shell-session-mode fundamental-mode &quot;shell-session-mode&quot; &quot;A major mode to display shell sessions.&quot; :group &#x27;shell-session (font-lock-add-keywords nil &#x27;((shell-session-prompt-regexp . font-lock-keyword-face)))) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.sh-session\\&#x27;&quot; . shell-session-mode)) (provide &#x27;shell-session-mode) ;;; shell-session-mode.el ends here. 
 I have the file located in my ~/.emacs.d/lisp and load it with use-package:
 (use-package shell-session-mode :load-path &quot;lisp&quot; :ensure nil)

To be more concrete, libraries which accepts some file describing language syntax and producing ELisp based parser for it. By all means I can handle format without such libraries but I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the best decision in Emacs world.

                              <span>My python workflow is strongly REPL oriented, i.e. interactively sending lines (including indented sublines) or blocks and defuns to the interpreter (i.e. I can&#x27;t just eval the whole buffer or just rely on running unit tests).
 I used to use elpy which covers many of these functions, but it is not really maintained and includes parts that would conflict with lsp etc.
 Any tips?
 I&#x27;m at the moment testing doom-emacs and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to have anything specific for this workflow either. The tips don&#x27;t necessarily have to be doom-emacs related.

I would like it to whenever I type that command, it opens a buffer/file that I can write, save, edit and execute. In my most recent CS class we used emacs and we could just type
 emacs whateverFileName.java 
 and it would create a file we could edit and save and exe if we compiled with javac and java. How do I do this with my personal emacs?

 default-cache-ttl 0 in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf 
 And I think it just made it _always_ ask for a pw on save, everytime, but still never when I open the file... it just works like magic. It did stop the OS from automagically decrypting the file (other file viewers)
 Emacs did ask for a password on open after a reboot, and I put in the wrong one. Now when I try to open the file I get:
 Wrong passphrase: Bad session key.
 but I&#x27;m never prompted for another password. I thought maybe a bad result would give insight, but it seems just a cached pw regardless. So emacs is also caching passwords somewhere? The same thing happens when I org-encrypt-entry and decrypt.... prompted for password once and can then crypt/decrpt pgp section without entering a password.
 Even killing emacs and rerunning doesn&#x27;t get it to forget the password... shrug.
 I just want a simple file asking for a password on read, and encrypting on save.
 Thanks for any help.

                              <span>I have been trying to live with Emacs, Lisp, and org-mode for the past few years. I was successful to some extent. 
 But now, the problem is that my fellow colleagues are heavily dependent on Microsoft products. 
 I hope, if I get work in my interested areas, I will enjoy my life forever.

                              <span>So I am going through System Crafters emacs from scratch tutorials to learn more about how to configure emacs and I am running into this problem.
 The relevant part of the init.el file is as follows:
 ;; (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority &quot;NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3&quot;) (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://mepla.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) (&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;))) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (require &#x27;use-package) 
 When I evaluate the buffer or run package-refresh-contents it will say that it failed to download the melpa archive:
 (from the *Messages* buffer)
 Importing package-keyring.gpg...done Contacting host: melpa.org:443 Failed to download ‘melpa’ archive. 
 It deals with elpa just fine though.
 Stuff I have tried but did not work:
  
adding (and uncommenting) that gnutls line mentioned by the melpa getting started guide.
 using the official melpa mirrors instead of melpa.org itself
 using http instead of https
  
I am running into this issue on fedora 37 with emacs 28.1
 The stuff I was ably to find through googling only mention fixes that I have already tried
 ​
 EDIT: yep it was the typo u/Kripposoft pointed out

 README.org:710: (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;JetBrainsMono Nerd Font 14&quot; :italic nil :height 146)) 
 But i expect:
  (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;JetBrainsMono Nerd Font 14&quot; :italic nil :height 146)) 
 To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t even find out which package is responsible for this, vertico or embark

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m new in the emacs world and after practicing a bit with doomemacs, I&#x27;m trying to configure vanilla emacs by myself with my own init.el file.
 I have installer tree-sitter for syntax highlighting and works fine for JS file but not for TS files. My configuration for tree-sitter is the next:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package tree-sitter :ensure t :config (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode))
 (use-package tree-sitter-langs :ensure t :after tree-sitter) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Anyone has the same problem? or I&#x27;m missing something in my configuration? Thanks!

                              <span>I disable the sidebar scroll and use mouse wheel only, I find the new scroll behaviour jarring as it scrolls too slowly. I&#x27;m guessing this is probably caused by smooth scrolling, the behavior seems to implement some type of acceleration functionality. How can I revert to the previous scrolling behaviour, whatever that was in emacs 28.x?

                              <span>I’ve really gotten into using tabs in Emacs 28.2. I’ve also been checking out Helm more thoroughly. Although Helm has the feature helm-filtered-bookmarks (which is great for me), but when hitting the  key, there are options for opening the bookmarked file in the current buffer, a buffer in a different window, and buffer in a different frame. I thought I’d dig a little to see if I could figure out how to add the ability to open a bookmark in a new tab.
 NOTE: I’m just a hobbiest programmer.
 I copied bookmark-jump-other-buffer and helm-bookmark-jump-other-buffer and modified them. I also used customize-option to add the line (&quot;Jump to BM other tab&quot; . my/helm-bookmark-jump-other-tab) to helm-type-bookmark-actions.
 (require &#x27;tab-bar) (require &#x27;helm) (defun my/bookmark-jump-other-tab (bookmark) &quot;Jump to BOOKMARK in another tab. See &#x60;bookmark-jump&#x27; for more.&quot; (interactive (list (bookmark-completing-read &quot;Jump to bookmark (in another tab)&quot; bookmark-current-bookmark))) (bookmark-jump bookmark &#x27;switch-to-buffer-other-tab)) (defun my/helm-bookmark-jump-other-tab (candidate) &quot;Jump to bookmark in other tab action.&quot; (let (non-essential) (my/bookmark-jump-other-tab candidate))) 
 I don’t know if the first require statement is necessary, given that tab-bar is part of GNU Emacs, but I added it just in case. The code seems to be working, but if there’s anything I’ve missed, I would be grateful for input. Also I was wondering if this is something that I should send along to the Helm author for the sake of completeness.

                              <span>I just found out that Emacs have a mode called Fido-vertical-mode, which is basically like having a basic helm or ivy + &quot;historic command&quot; + fuzzy search out of the box without any configuration. And this even though I&#x27;ve been using Emacs since version 24, yeah not very old but... Long enough for missing these feature. Now am wondering what else did I really miss in these latest versions.
 I find it in a reddit post in this sub while trying to get into vertico which is apparently the new Ivy.

 This Lua code highlight text, copied via commands, like 3yw for example. As I&#x27;m using evil, I&#x27;m curious how to do the same in Emacs

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 Weeks ago, I started preparing videos for my team, targeting devs that have never worked with Scala/Scala.js, So far, these videos have proved to be useful internally, and, I consider that they can be useful for the Scala community, which is why I came to share them: https://youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLuXlisDoXarJxZaMTGA-QtENkYeX0rg-x
 These videos cover how I set up my local environment, which include, helpful cli tools, compiling and running an app, executing tests from IntelliJ, etc.

 Does anyone know of anything that does this?

 Changes since v2.9.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
In YAML configuration files, the package-index key is introduced which takes precedence over the existing package-indices key. The latter is deprecated.
 In YAML configuration files, the hackage-security key of the package-index key or the package-indices item can be omitted, and the Hackage Security configuration for the item will default to that for the official Hackage server. See #5870.
 Add the stack config set package-index download-prefix command to set the location of Stack&#x27;s package index in YAML configuration files.
 stack setup with the --no-install-ghc flag warns that the flag and the command are inconsistent and now takes no action. Previously the flag was sile…</span>

                              <span>Recently in another thread, @ctietze asks us to consider if categories help or hinder the note taking process, because the topic is different enough, I&#x27;ve created a new thread. Here are my (quick) thoughts on the issue.
Yes I agree, categories can be constraining, but in my thinking categories by themselves are not the root issue. The inability to move between contexts is the real bottleneck. That can be fixed with tag-maps.
First, open this site in a new tab (&amp; once there, click a box to understand visually) for an example of provisioning a user with arbitrary context/mappings...
https://www.lemoda.net/c/index.html
Now then, here&#x27;s the syntactical sugar...
tags: map{science, notes, *}, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
Where...
tagline is:          &#x27;tags:&#x27;
map declaration is:  &#x27;map{token 1, token nth}&#x27;
tags (1 or more) is: &#x27;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&#x27;

1/3 split tag-map into tokens...
map[0] &#x3D; science;
map[1] &#x3D; notes;
map[2] &#x3D; *; // asterisk is a wildcard &amp; matches any/all taxonomies...

2/3 user selects a mapped token...
selected_map &#x3D; map[1];

3/3 commence comparisons...
for (x &#x3D; 0; x &lt; max; x++) {

  if (map[x] &#x3D;&#x3D; selected_map &amp;&amp; query &#x3D;&#x3D; tag) show_data...

}

                              <span>In Emacs29 I&#x27;ve moved from LSP to Eglot, Treesitter to tsetter, and Company to Corfu - and all is working nicely for Typescript development.
 I&#x27;m trying to setup for Python development, and have spent an entire day trying to get it to recognize a virtualenvironment. This is working in Elpy, but I&#x27;d really prefer to use eglot for Python.
 My python config is...
 (use-package python-mode :defer :mode (&quot;\\.py\\&#x27;&quot; . python-ts-mode) :interpreter &quot;ipython&quot; :custom (truncate-lines t)) (use-package pyvenv :ensure t :init (setenv &quot;WORKON_HOME&quot; &quot;~/.pyenv/versions&quot;)) 
 And I have verified that eglot-current-server is &quot;~/.cache/fnm_multishells/84695_1671319057550/bin/pyright-langserver --stdio&quot;. I test for whether the virtualenv is active by whether pandas_datareader is found. It&#x27;s not, though I know it&#x27;s in the virtualenv (testing in ipython&#x27;s cli). 
 Anyone successful loading Python virtualenvs in eglot in Emacs29?

                              <span>Howdy,
 ​
 Is it possible in general.el to redirect a key to a specific map? For example, when you load evil, and have speechd-el loaded, C-e gets rebound to evil-scroll-line-down. I&#x27;ve been reading the general.el docs and I haven&#x27;t found what I am looking for, namely putting C-e back onto speechd-speak-mode map.

                              <span>I have currently set the color theme on my GNU Emacs distribution to be the spacemacs-dark. However the title bar, menu bar, tab bar, tool bar, and scroll bar still appear as this bland, basic, off white color. Now I don&#x27;t actually use most of the features I just mentioned, but I would like to have them available in the case that it became necessary for whatever reason. So my question is, how can I &quot;extend&quot; the spacemacs-dark color theme to these other features on Emacs?
 Note: I use Emacs on Windows, if that makes any difference.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning about the difference between neovim and emacs.
 Some people have pointed out that which would be best for someone mainly depends on what you want to use it for. Which makes sense.
 ​
 And I think for myself, first and foremost, I would like to use either neovim or emacs as an IDE. 
 Does Emacs work well as an IDE? 
 The main languages I&#x27;d be using would be: Python, Assembly x86 with AT&amp;T syntax, R, Maxima, Latex,
 And maybe some Java

                              <span>Howdy, folks.
 I bounce back and forth between GUI Emacs and emacsclient over an SSH pty depending on if I&#x27;m at my main workstation or at a different machine. On GUI Emacs, auto-dim-other-buffer (which is a misnomer as it actually works on windows) is fine. But at a terminal emacs even with hicolor support it just makes the non-focused window have the same colors for the text and a white background. This causes problems -- through different problems -- whether I&#x27;m running a light theme or a dark theme. 
 I&#x27;m curious what others do to for quick visual indications as to which window is active/focused and if any of your solutions works out well for both GUI Emacs and Emacs in a terminal? 
 thx

 The completion is good, though I was wondering if it is possible to change certain ones. For example, if I&#x27;m doing a def __init__() in python, I would like to have &quot;self, &quot; automatically be put inside the parentheses. 
 ​
 Also, is there a way to enable dictionary completions in python? If I have a text document open, and I start typing a word similar to one already in the document, I get the suggestion, but this is not the case when working in a python file.
 ​
 Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently started using an M1 Mac for work, having previously used linux, and am finding the performance of magit to be extremely slow.
 I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s some oddity of my setup in particular, although my colleague notices the same issues. 
 We are both using emacs-mac, his installed from homebrew via the railwaycat formula, mine built from the emacs-28.1-mac-9.1 tag using nix. I understand that this has a perf fix after a MacOS change to &#x60;vfork&#x60; last year.
 Some examples of the kind of performance issues we&#x27;re seeing: it takes a few seconds to open the git status buffer (even on very small projects with little git history - longer on larger projects), and going through a diff to stage selected hunks seems to take a second or two for each one, which seems very high and is frustrating when you have a lot of changes to look through when trying to create a logical commit. On linux all these operations felt more or less instantaneous.
 I&#x27;ve seen suggestions for improving performance by disabling parts of the status screen etc., but I&#x27;d rather avoid doing this if possible, and not sure if this would help with peformance when staging something. The fundamental issue seems to be around slowness when emacs creates processes, rather than anything specific to magit, I just notice it with magit in particular as it creates a lot of git processes.
 I just wondered if this was considered &#x27;normal&#x27; on MacOS and everyone just puts up with it, in which case I&#x27;ll have to learn to live with it too. But I&#x27;m a bit baffled by the fact that there just seems to be very little discussion online about the problem.
 If anyone has any insight, even if it&#x27;s just to share that they see the same behaviour so I no longer feel like I&#x27;m going insane, it would be much appreciated :-)

                              <span>this is the second time i am ending up in this rabbit hole. all the searching suggest that this is a complex topic, yet i find it puzzling why there is not a standard solution in a time webdev dominates computing. is there a package, function, a phrase, an operator [[:url:]], something obvious i keep missing?
 do you have that magic string i can feed into &quot;rgrep&quot;?
 thank you!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve installed emacs onto my linux system however, when I try to create a file using the emacs command it opens up in a different window than my terminal. How do I get it to open the file in my terminal? I know about the emacs -nw command but I want to have to type that every time. Also when I was able to get a file open there were no line numbers, how do i setup emacs. I&#x27;ve tried looking it up but all the guides online are about installing emacs.

                              <span>I’m wanting to sort corfu candidates by string length, from shortest to longest. By default, I believe corfu does sort by string length, but it groups the candidates and restarts the sort several times in a long list of candidates (e.g., the cape-symbol capf) depending on several factors. I thought the below settings would get me the global sort I’m looking for, but no luck: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (customize-set-variable &#x27;corfu-sort-override-function #&#x27;my/corfu--sort)
 (defun my/corfu--sort (list) &quot;Sorting predicate which compares X and Y.&quot; (sort list #&#x27;my/corfu--sort-predicate))
 (defun my/corfu--sort-predicate (x y) (&lt; (length x) (length y))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Does anyone have a solution? Thank you!

                              <span>I use org-metadown to swap two elements of a list in org mode, and I&#x27;d like to swap any two org mode lines.
 I&#x27;ve found this snippet: Using M-up and M-down to transpose paragraphs : however it moves the whole org-element (for example a paragraph), and I want something simply line-based. I&#x27;ve tried to define this hook:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-metaup-hook (lambda () (interactive) (prog2 (transpose-lines 1) (previous-line 2)))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-metadown-hook (lambda () (interactive) (progn (next-line 1) (transpose-lines -1) (previous-line 1)))) 
 But is doing strange things and I don&#x27;t understand transpose-lines very well. It seems like there is no way for the cursor move along with the line you are moving up and down.
 Is there a simpler way to do this?

I tried in a buffer with Rust, Python, Elisp and an Org mode buffer and it threw the error in all of them. I also restarted the Emacs instance and still got the same result. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 Edit: Ended up being Meow Mode that caused the issue.

                              <span>A function (satisfiableSubset) takes a list of formulae, and from this list, will return a list of the largest sublists that are logically satisfiable for the formulae. The isSatisfiable function is a separate function I wrote to check a function is logically satisfiable. So far, my code is close to working, but when using the subsequences function, it includes the empty sublist as part of the sublists that are returned. I don&#x27;t want this empty list to be returned, and I know filter (not . null) is a useful way of getting rid of empty lists.
 However, I don&#x27;t know how I can combine this filter with the filter I have in the else statement below - to filter the sublists of satisfiable formulae AND also filter the sublists so that there are no empty sublists returned. In other words, I want to combine these two predicates in the else statement below. Can someone help me with this please?

                              <span>Discussion for giving a name to a subset of a type class&#x27;s interface.
 It&#x27;s difficult to get the granularity of the type class hierarchy right, in some cases type classes have too many methods for a particular type: it&#x27;s possible to implement a subset of the interface but some methods cannot be implemented.
 Solutions like default superclass instances exist for almost the same issue, but it assumes the superclass is fully determined by the new subclass but this is often not the case. For example the Semigroup-Monoid proposal could not be implemented with this approach.
 I propose a different approach that doesn&#x27;t require a superclass, but selects a subset the class methods and gives them a name. This name can be treated like a regular class, instances can be defined, it can be derived and …</span>

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;m SDE in a company and we use scala. I&#x27;m a beginner in Scala and know the basics. I started going through the RED book for scala functional programming and I think that is really tough and brainstorming. So I&#x27;m looking for someone like minded whom I can brainstorm together and go through concepts of functional programming and side by side we can develop some basic projects. Also, any other guidance on how to approach functional programming is well appreciated. Thanks.

 Is there a method to periodically discover UUID removed? How do you keep the attachment directory clean?

                              <span>So I’m plunging myself deeply into using org mode at work! I’ve been using Obsidian for note taking and I like it but I really like the extensibility of emacs and org mode……. And I’m a sucker for tweaking things so they will behave exactly like I want them to 😂
 Anyways….
 One of the things I use obsidian for is contact management and handling incoming calls from coworkers where I jot down what we talked about. I work in the IT department so my coworkers call me all the time with problems that need solving. 
 I have a pretty good idea how to manage contacts with org but it’s the incoming calls part that I’m having problems with. 
 Is there a way to create a capture template for incoming calls that “asks” which contact from the Contacts.org file this call is from? Or is there any smart way that I can link incoming calls to contacts from the Contacts.org file?
 I want this feature so bad since my coworkers are always questioning what we talked about over the phone and when 😂

I prefer using the REPEAT keyword for them instead of TODO. The problem is that when I mark a repeating task as DONE, the REPEAT keyword resets back into TODO. Is there a way prevent that? Thank you.

                              <span>Several hours into tracking down an usually (chuckle or abysmally) subtle glitch in an attempt to squash a bug in some newly coded[1] regex[2] routines, I&#x27;ve hit on a quite nifty idea...
Tag Globbing[3]
Here&#x27;s the scoop: Imagine a tag labeled &#x27;books&#x27;, yeah I know, no big deal, but there&#x27;s more to it than that hear me out... Now imagine that same tag retitled &#x27;books/fiction&#x27; &amp; now I&#x27;m thinking about virtualized pathways for tags &amp; the plot thickens. Lets create some more...
tags: books/fiction/the grapes of wrath

tags: books/science/outline of history/my-notes

tags: books/travelogue/wind sand &amp; stars

Now, if you recall I&#x27;d noted earlier I was (yes &#x27;was&#x27; the issue is fixed) wrestling with a regex/wildcard issue when bam! the idea came to me: paths for tags that can expand via wildcard &amp; globbing. An example...
books, books/, books/*    # all return tag-path books/
books/fiction             # returns all tags within tag-path books/fiction
books/*/wind sand &amp; stars # returns the &#x27;relative path&#x27; for wind sand &amp; stars 

Lots more wildcard patterns too... Of course there are no folders or directories, its simply a construct mapped onto the tags providing not only a method of grouping context, but a nested hierarchy or a taxonomy if you like.
Well, got to run for now.

                              <span>To nerd out about academic writing workflows in Emacs, this December brought us some interesting details by Chan Chung Hong:
Bibliography management using a BibTeX file and fetching metadata of papers based on the DOI
Citing in emacs based on the BibTeX file
Academic writing using RMarkdown, and quickly exporting PDFs
Since we talk about BibTeX as a great format with good tooling for literature management a lot around here, this workflow is quite compatible with a Zettelkasten that is set up with it in mind.
The series continues, but currently the focus in more on the &quot;R&quot; programming part than writing. Couldn&#x27;t wait for the end of the series to share this, though</span>

                              <span>Trying to solve this problem in Haskell.
 A function takes a list of formulae, and from this list, will return a list of the largest sublists that are logically satisfiable. 
 I&#x27;ve already written the function to check if a formula is logically satisfiable, isSatisfiable:
 type Element &#x3D; (Char, Bool)
 type Variable &#x3D; [Element]
 models :: Expression -&gt; [Variable]
 models form &#x3D; filter satisfies (valuations (variables form))
 where satisfies val &#x3D; eval val form
 isSatisfiable:: [Expression] -&gt; Bool
 isSatisfiable[] &#x3D; True
 isSatisfiable &#x3D; (not . null . models . foldl1 And) es
 Now I want to write a similar function that would take in a list of formulae and return the sublists based off the criteria mentioned above. I think I know how I would go about doing this; I would split the formulae given into sublists and check which ones are satisfiable (by calling the isSatisfiable function) and return those ones. However, as I&#x27;m new to Haskell I&#x27;m not sure how I would go about implementing this. Can someone help please?

                              <span>I&#x27;m toying with the idea of using Haskell to make a mobile app, ios to start then later android.
 This is for a panic disorder app I&#x27;ve been wanting to make for some time, I&#x27;ve suffer/ed from them. The apps out there aren&#x27;t that good and the industry standard is to have the app live behind a high monthly fee paywall which I disagree with.
 I&#x27;m going to build my backend in Haskell but rather than using something like React-Native I wondered if I could also do the mobile app in Haskell. Ideally I&#x27;d want access to native functions like taking pictures, bionic neural engine etc.
 From researching seems like Obelisk might be the right tool for this, but wanted to know if others had built mobile apps in Haskell and their experience/advice if this is a good root to take?
 Also been looking at Rust (trying to keep things FP 😅) but due to not knowing the language, I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s worth learning! Feels like I&#x27;ve been stuck on making these choices and never get started, so trying to break that today!!

                              <span>I am very excited about the new JS (and WASM) backends for GHC (see https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/zlrk40/javascript_backend_merged_into_ghc_iog_engineering/) and today immediately made a quick test using two little programs from the Computer Language Benchmarksgame.
 The first was the pi digits exercise. And I was very excited that GHC immediately compiled the code without any problems and the program ran for the first 1000 digits in 10.36 sec. Although it is currently completely unfair to compare this with other implementations since the JS back-end is not optimised in any way it is nonetheless not completely uninteresting and the result was 0.081 sec for the hand-written JS code with node. That&#x27;s a factor of 128 faster.
 The second program had to create a 1024 pixel wide Mandelbrot bitmap and compiled and worked equally well. It took 77 sec compared with 0.74 sec for the node version which is about 104 times faster.
 Although the numbers might seem far away from a decent performance I am still very excited about the seamless experience and intend to explore this further for future work. Congratulations to the dev team!!!
 There is indeed an optimisation flag -O here as well and when activated the code runs about ten times as fast compared to the above. Therefore the difference to hand-written JS code shrinks considerably.

                              <span>Hi,
 I wanted to give emacs29 a try on my artix running dwm.
 I installed emacs29-git but I read this warning while starting emacs that the version was not working well on X11.
 What version do you use on Arch/Artix machine not running GTK or Wayland??
 Thanks for sharing

                              <span>I recently came across lsp-java and I wanted to give it a try. I was able to install it with no issues and I&#x27;m able to add projects to the workspace.
 I&#x27;m coming across an issue where the LSP server isn&#x27;t able to find methods from other classes within my projects. Flycheck shows many errors such as:
  
The method  is undefined for the the type  log cannot be resolved
  
When I open my projects in VS Code, these errors do not show up. For further context, this is a Spring Boot project that uses Maven. I&#x27;m also able to build this project from the shell with no issues. Trying to build through lsp-java fails because of the errors it is seeing.
 I&#x27;ve tried the following in trying to resolve this:
  
Tried using OpenJDK 11, 15 and 17
 I made sure that the JAVA_HOME path and the /usr/bin/java symlink are pointing to the same version of the JDK (I tried this with the three version of the JDK I have installed on my system)
 Made sure I deleted the ~/.emacs.d/workspace directory when changing the JDK configuration to ensure I&#x27;m working off a fresh configuration
  
I&#x27;m not sure what else to try. I&#x27;m hoping to get some guidance on what else I can try. I&#x27;m confused why I&#x27;m not seeing these errors in VS Code which as far as I know, they use the same backend - I&#x27;m using the Red Hat extension which also uses Eclipse JDT.
 Has anyone else come across something like this before? Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I was a straight.el user and when use-package was added to the core the keyword for straight was removed from the use-package in emacs core. I know I could use use-package from github but I was wondering if it would be possible to replace the whole functionality with package-vc. Even if there is no key word for it can package-vc manage dependencies(i.e. in fully vc form without package.el installs)

                              <span>Hey all
 I&#x27;m toying with using project.el in place of projectile, since I barely use any of projectile&#x27;s features other than switching between known projects.
 One thing I&#x27;m struggling with is the workflow element. Along with projectile I have perspective and persp-projectile, and I have bound p in the projectile-command-map to projectile-persp-switch-project which gives a great experience when flipping back and forth between related code repositories, something I have to do often.
 Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to replicate this great experience. I briefly tried using persp-mode with persp-mode-project-bridge but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an analogue for projectile-persp-switch-project.
 What this means is that using Projectile I can have a 2-window split in one &quot;project&quot; and 6 in the other, and flipping between them is nice and smooth. Whereas in Project each time I switch the flow is broken, since the default action is to present a menu and maybe open a single file.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from people who maybe use Project+ and have a similar workflow/experience to what I&#x27;m aiming for.
 If it helps, my config is based on vertico+consult+embark.
 As always, thanks in advance for your suggestions/support!

 So trying to configure Emacs, it&#x27;s my 1st time so it ain&#x27;t much but it&#x27;s something.
 Any trick or tips might add to my init file?
 https://github.com/MimiValsi/my-emacs-config.git
 ​
 @ the moment only have eglot, gopls, YASnippet.
 For those, got the feeling I might miss something important in there.
 Cheers , ^^&#x27;
 ​
 EDIT: Is there a &quot;good&quot; way to learn Lisp or Elisp?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an emac / LISP newbie. 
 I haven&#x27;t really dug into it yet, but is it possible to take an org file.. take a series of 1st level or 2nd level headlines and generate .md (or .org) files based on its content?
 i.e. in somecollection.org
 * item1 # updated sometimes yesterday sometext ** item1 subheading somemore text * item2 something about item2 
 Then take that, and make item1.md, item2.md with the contents of item1.md looking like:
 # item1 Some text ## item1 subheading somemore text 
 and item2.md:
 # item2 something about item2 
 My premise: I want to maintain some collection of data in a single file and publish it into another format for sharing/distribution. With comment blocks ignored and not shared.
 It doesn&#x27;t have to be exactly like I described, if there&#x27;s a reliable package that does something like this already.

                              <span>Currently I am using a consult-ripgrep wrapper that inserts some sensible defaults options so my initial input looks like this:
 #█ -- -g *.md -g !test/** --no-hidden --no-follow -U --sort path #
 When I need to add another option, like:
 #def -- -█ -g *.md -g !test/** --no-hidden --no-follow -U --sort path #
 For a long one as --ignore-file-case-insensitive, having shell-like TAB completion definitely makes typing it more bearable, like what https://github.com/szermatt/emacs-bash-completion provides in the screenshot for shell-command prompt.

 Searching suggested me https://github.com/JonWaltman/pcmpl-args.el, but after looking at the README, I still don&#x27;t get how to use it.

                              <span>Hey everyone! I posted yesterday about some difficulties I have had with virtual environments and Emacs, trying to finally set up Emacs as a Python IDE. I have elpy set up, and have managed to get that working. The only issue left is I have no idea how to wrap my head around pyvenv, which came included. Trying pyvenv-workon prompts me to set WORKON_HOME, which I&#x27;m unsure about since I run Windows 10, and when I try to activate venvs I&#x27;ve already made and have stored on my computer it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Any advice on how I can use pyvenv effectively and program with Python well in Emacs, or any good documentation sources on what exactly is going on? I&#x27;ve tried reading the manuals, couldn&#x27;t really make heads or tails of the virtual environments content.

 &quot;ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d&quot; is the command, but make sure .emacs.d doesn&#x27;t exit when you do it.
 ------
 TL;DR: ln -s emacs-setup .emacs.d creates an .emacs.d dir with a link underneath to emacs-setup, where emacs-setup is the repo name.
 Emacs-setup is my github (on my other box it lives in my emacs.d). So this second machine is the first time I&#x27;m dealing with pulling it down. Conventional wisdom is &quot;just sym link .emacs.d to your repo&quot; -- but no snippets I find work to do that. (On WSL2 ubuntu just installed).
 I&#x27;d settle for pulling my repo contents straight to .emacs.d (how its setup on my other machine) -- but sym link should be pretty easy.
 I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s a dumb mistake and not an issue with wsl2.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or snippets to cut/paste and then I&#x27;ll give results.

 It is possible the underlying files have been updated. You can explicitly invalidate the cache in Spark by running &#x27;REFRESH TABLE tableName&#x27; command in SQL or by recreating the Dataset/DataFrame involved.

                              <span>I use The Archive. Occasionally, I find notes that are no longer needed, and I move them from The Archive into a &quot;cold storage&quot; folder. This could potentially leave &quot;dangling links&quot; around. At other times, I want to link to a source file on my hard drive, but rather than using an inline file:/// link, which is prone to breaking, I just drop another zettel link inline (eg see the source file [[202212152155]] on my hard drive).
Naturally, when running across these links, clicking on them in The Archive gives no results, and leads to nowhere. This requires me to then copy the zettel id out, and paste it into a file-system-wide search. Ideally, this would be a smoother process.
I&#x27;m interested in any suggestions for making this process smoother.
I notice there&#x27;s a contextual menu in The Archive, when clicking on these links. Perhaps I could create a system service that would show up here? Perhaps there&#x27;s some other way to automate a fallback search.
Any ideas are appreciated.</span>

                              <span>Moving to Emacs 28.1 on Windows (from 26 or 27) introduces a strange behaviour on my laptop but not desktop. The setup is the same on both. Identical .emacs files used, same emacs theme.
 On the laptop, the first time I find an .org file in an emacs session, it does not format it as an org (heading colours, size etc. not correct). I can work around by either killing the buffer and finding the file again. Or by M-x org-mode. From then on in a given session, any .org file I find, opens correctly.
 I don&#x27;t have this on my desktop - just works first time.
 Any ideas or file a bug?

                              <span>Heads up - If you use plantuml from MacPorts the latest update 1.2022.14 changes the location of plantuml.jar to /opt/local/share/java/plantuml/plantuml.jar - had to adjust org-plantuml-jar-path accordingly to get Org Babel to work.

                              <span>I am a big fan of alpahapapa&#x27;s org-super-agenda for my GTD dashboard (tho need to update it for org-ql). However, I have this weird thing that happens with my config that I&#x27;ve been unable to figure out: 
 It will only ever trigger once - switching to any query or custom view and then trying to get the org-super-agenda view back gives me the default org-agenda view. I actually have to exit emacs and relaunch in order to get the org-super-agenda view back. This has recently become more problematic since I&#x27;m using org-agenda-custom-commands for a Resonance Cal, Blog Queue, and Experiments list.
 Can anyone think of a reason that would occur or what I may have done wrong in my config below? 
 elisp (use-package org-super-agenda :straight t :after org :defer t :config (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;u&quot; &quot;Super view&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ( (org-agenda-span 1) (org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;( (:name &quot;Today&quot; :tag (&quot;bday&quot; &quot;ann&quot; &quot;hols&quot; &quot;cal&quot; &quot;today&quot;) :time-grid t :todo (&quot;WIP&quot;) :deadline today :scheduled today) (:name &quot;Overdue&quot; :deadline past) (:name &quot;Reschedule&quot; :scheduled past) (:name &quot;Perso&quot; :tag &quot;perso&quot;) (:name &quot;Due Soon&quot; :deadline future :scheduled future ) )))) (tags (concat &quot;w&quot; (format-time-string &quot;%V&quot;)) ((org-agenda-overriding-header (concat &quot;--\nToDos Week &quot; (format-time-string &quot;%V&quot;))) (org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;((:discard (:deadline t)) (:discard (:scheduled t)) (:discard (:todo (&quot;DONE&quot;))) (:name &quot;Ticklers&quot; :tag &quot;someday&quot;) (:name &quot;Perso&quot; :and (:tag &quot;perso&quot; :not (:tag &quot;someday&quot;))) (:name &quot;UH&quot; :and (:tag &quot;uh&quot; :not (:tag &quot;someday&quot;))) ;; (:name &quot;Neo&quot; ;; :and (:tag &quot;neo&quot; :not (:tag &quot;someday&quot;))) (:name &quot;Ping&quot; :tag &quot;crm&quot;) )))) ))))) (org-agenda nil &quot;u&quot;)) ) 
 If you&#x27;re interested in how this helps me GTD and keep in touch with folks an old post (which desperately needs revistsing and re-writing now I use org-roam and have dropped some of the libraries mentioned) is here:

                              <span>I have just - long overdue - upgraded Mu4E to 1.8.x from (gasp) 1.4.x. I have previously used the built-in Mu4E message view, but that has been retired now, so I need to learn my way around the GNUS based message view. And there&#x27;s this one thing that bugs me, look at this screenshot:
 https://i.imgur.com/rOsRApi.png
 I had to blur the recipient list out, but that is what is bugging me: GNUS apparently applies some kind of hard wrap on the recipient list which makes it look jumbled and confusing and take up unnecessary vertical screen space. 
 Is there a way to make it just soft-wrap the recipient list like a single long line so it doesn&#x27;t introduce random line breaks and indents, and so it uses the screen space more economically?

                              <span>I wrote a new minor mode called binky-mode for jumping between positions in buffers and files with the same mechanism of register-to-point. Features included:
  
Better ui and customization, more information than register method.
 Vim-like mark and jump style.
 Integration with buffers recently used.
 Margin indicator support
  
The emacs version which this package supports is &gt;&#x3D;26.3 . And only rely on cl-lib. The package is under check in Melpa right now, so maybe you need to install it from github . 
 Since I use it for a quite few time and satisfied with it now. I hope if anybody would find it useful and give some advices.
 Thanks!

                              <span>When I edit typescript files with eglot active, it resets indent-tabs-mode and inserts tabs. I can toggle indent-tabs-mode to go back to spaces, but I&#x27;d like to leave it set the way I like. I&#x27;m trying to follow the instructions for eglot-workspace-configuration in the eglot manual, but it&#x27;s not working.
 I&#x27;ve tried creating a .dir.local.el file to set preferences for &quot;typescript-language-server&quot; (see below), but eglot-show-workspace-configuration shows nil, so I don&#x27;t think these are being found.
 The kap/eglot-current-server command I&#x27;ve written (see below) confirms that I&#x27;m running &quot;(typescript-language-server --stdio)&quot;.
 (use-package eglot :hook ((js-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (tsx-ts-mode . eglot-ensure) (typescript-ts-mode . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-stay-out-of indent-tabs-mode) ;; (This didn&#x27;t work) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map)) (defun kap/eglot-current-server () (interactive) (message &quot;%s&quot; (process-command (jsonrpc--process (eglot-current-server))))) 
 And .dir.local.el looks like this:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:typescript-language-server (:typescript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil) (:javascript.format.convertTabsToSpaces nil)))))) 
 The root problem is the insistence of eglot and/or the lsp server on tabs rather than spaces.
 But the bigger issue I&#x27;d like is how to get configuration into the lsp server. Has anyone got .dir.local.el configuration to work for the &quot;typescript-language-server&quot;?

                              <span>Now that Artur has archived https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox, I wonder if anyone has suggestions for alternatives. I&#x27;m especially interested in a way to show changes in a package since the last update. Paradox allowed this via querys to Github repos. It didn&#x27;t always work but was helpful when it did!
 Note that this is specific to package.el -- I&#x27;m not asking about alternative package managers like straight. Thank you!

 and when I first executed it it generated f4results.png fine and embedded the result as a #+RESULTS: in the org file as expected.
 If I add more data to the f4resultdat table (not shown) and re-run the code f4results.png is correctly updated but the embedded image in the org file does not change. I&#x27;ve tried deleting the png, closing the file, and going from org to fundamental and back again but nothing fixes it. Meanwhile, the png file gets updated on disc every time I run the block.
 Any advice/thoughts?

                              <span>Howdy! I like configuring Emacs, and I like comprehensive lists. I thought it might be handy for newcomers and greybeards alike if there were a comprehensive list of things to consider when creating an Emacs configuration.
 I&#x27;ll keep the list updated as people comment with their suggestions. Here is the current list: - Made for me or made for others too? - Should I use early-init.el? - Modular config, or everything in init.el? - straight.el &amp; use-package or no? - Keybinds spread throughout the config or contained in a keybinds section?

                              <span>I updated packages today (using auto-package-update). After restart, I get a warning in *Warnings*: 
 Error (use-package): Cannot load helm-config
 And in the top of the *Messages* buffer I see:
 Error loading autoloads: (void-function helm-make-source)
 I see in the helm GitHub repo history that helm-config has been removed (like 3 days ago). What is the correct way to install and configure helm now, using use-package? Below is my config for helm:
 (use-package helm :ensure t :bind ((&quot;M-x&quot; . helm-M-x) (&quot;C-x C-f&quot; . helm-find-files) (&quot;C-x C-b&quot; . helm-buffers-list) (&quot;M-s o&quot; . helm-occur) (&quot;M-s i&quot; . helm-imenu) (&quot;M-s I&quot; . helm-imenu-in-all-buffers) (&quot;M-s m&quot; . helm-mini) (&quot;M-s b&quot; . helm-bookmarks)) :config (use-package helm-config) (setq helm-split-window-inside-p t) (setq helm-use-frame-when-more-than-two-windows nil) (setq imenu-max-item-length 120) (setq helm-buffer-max-length nil) (helm-mode 1) (helm-autoresize-mode 1)) 
 If I remove the (use-package helm-config) part the warning disappears but the error in the *Messages* buffer remains, all seems to work though.
 In the commit removing helm-config it is replaced with helm-autoloads. Should I replace helm-config with helm-autoloads in my use-package statement? I tried, and it seems to work equally bad or well with the error still in the top of the *Messages* buffer.

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m studying eshell and I&#x27;ve found problems when using history expansion. Commands like !n or !! fail to expand to the referred command. This is what I mean:
 ~ $ history 1 pwd 2 ls -l 3 date 4 history ~ $ !! !!: command not found ~ $ !2 !2: command not found 
 That was run on an eshell session, emacs 28.1 (built myself from source with default options) started with --no-init-file option.
 There&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing wrong ?
 Thanks in advance.

 The documentation is a bit flaky. Any users here who like to share an example?

I&#x27;ve been trying again to make it so I can do all my python stuff in Emacs, and I&#x27;ve installed elpy and everything and made a virtualenv, but I have no idea how to install packages to it. Is there a way for me to do this from within Emacs, or would I have to do it through the command line? I&#x27;m currently on Windows 10, if that helps.

                              <span>Are there any lists of translations of common vi/vim idioms to Emacs?
 I am a longtime vi user trying to migrate back to Emacs, but sometimes I struggle when I want to do something that I&#x27;ve done thousands of times in vi.
 For example:
 :g/foo/s/bar/baz/
 e.g. &quot;For each line containing the pattern &#x27;foo&#x27;, replace the string &#x27;bar&#x27; with the string &#x27;baz&#x27;.&quot;
 Usually a bit of google-fu yields a solution, but this one seems difficult.

                              <span>Hi Guys, 
 I was wondering if anyone can help me with the issue below. I&#x27;m trying to process org-mode table using elisp as shown below. It seems that org would think my data is of INT type and lose the leading zeros, but in fact it is of TEXT type. How do I make org treat my data as TEXT instead of number? I cannot simply add leading zeros after processing, as the number of zeros is uncertain.

                              <span>Hi guys! I want to use different input methods for different evil modes in emacs. To be more specific, I use colemak for English input (and basically everything else inside emacs), but qwerty for Chinese input. 
 As I&#x27;ve been exploring, I found several possible ways of implementing this: letting fcitx handle the input methods and interface with it using &#x60;fcitx.el&#x60;, or let emacs handle everything and use &#x60;pyim&#x60; for Chinese input. 
 I feel like both methods are bad. For fcitx, I&#x27;m not sure if the package could change fcitx state as buffers, major/minor modes change. Even it is possible, I suspect that it will be a huge hacking work (I&#x27;m a noob with elisp). For the native input methods, I&#x27;m not sure how to make the system input methods ignore emacs. Also, letting emacs handle its own inputs seems... inelegant.
 Do you have any good solutions for inputting Chinese in emacs, with colemak as the default English input? Any help would be appreciated!

 But the x gets marked as a mistake, and I dont understand why.

 I would appreciate if someone could help me :)

                              <span>Consider the following function definitions :
 data Tree a &#x3D; Leaf a | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) sumLeaves :: Tree a -&gt; Integer sumLeaves (Leaf x) &#x3D; 1 sumLeaves (Node _ lt rt) &#x3D; sumLeaves lt + sumLeaves rt sumNodes :: Tree a -&gt; Integer sumNodes (Leaf x) &#x3D; 0 sumNodes (Node _ lt rt) &#x3D; 1 + sumNodes lt + sumNodes rt 
 Now I want to prove with Structural induction that for all finite trees t :: Tree a holds:
 sumLeaves t &#x3D; sumNodes t + 1
 I now have:
 sumLeaves t &#x3D; sumNodes t + 1 I.A.: t &#x3D; (Tree 0) &#x3D; (Leaf 0) sumLeaves (Leaf 0) &#x3D; 1 sumNodes (Leaf 0) + 1 0 + 1 &#x3D; 1 1 &#x3D; 1 I.V.: We assume that the statement holds for an arbitrary t. 
 I.S.:
 Now what is the induction step, I really have problems with solving this last step.

                              <span>Hey!
 ​
 I am learning algebraic-data-types in Haskell, and I ran into a problem I cannot solve.
 So I want to enter a list of groceries, and as an output I should get the total price.
 ​
 For now, I have the types:
 data Item &#x3D; A | B | C deriving (Eq, Show) data List &#x3D; Empty | Add Item List 
 ​
 and I have the groceries list:
 list1 &#x3D; A &#x60;Add&#x60; (B &#x60;Add&#x60; Empty) 
 ​
 I have a function (That sets the prices of the items):
 p:: Item -&gt; Int p A &#x3D; 2 p B &#x3D; 4 p C &#x3D; 5 
 ​
 And now here is where I have a difficulty.
 I want to apply the function &quot;p&quot; to my list1. But I am not sure how.
 ​
 Here is my current code:
 price:: (Item -&gt; Int) -&gt; List a -&gt; Int price p (Add x xs) | x &#x3D;&#x3D; A &#x3D; A + price xs | x &#x3D;&#x3D; B &#x3D; B + price xs | x &#x3D;&#x3D; C &#x3D; C + price xs | otherwise &#x3D; 0 
 I also tried this.
 price:: (Item -&gt; Int) -&gt; List a -&gt; Int price p (Add x xs) &#x3D; x + price xs 
 Thanks in advance!

 I am tying to create a function where I enter an Algebraic data type list, and it should output an actual list.
 For example, we have a list1 &#x3D; P &#x60;Cons&#x60; (G &#x60;Cons&#x60; Empty)
 The Output should be: [P, G] 
 I created the following Algebraic data types:

 (I want &quot;a&quot; to be only type &quot;Elements&quot;)
 ​
 and my current function is:
 list:: Elements -&gt; [List] list Empty &#x3D; [] list Cons a (List b) &#x3D; [a] ++ list (List b) 
 I am having trouble solving this, and would appreciate if I get some help!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m trying to implement preOrder (First, the root is considered, then recursively the left and then the right subtree) and levelOrder (The nodes are viewed in ascending depth from left to right.)
 I have:
 data BTree a &#x3D; Nil | Node a (BTree a) (BTree a) deriving Show
 preOrder :: BTree a -&gt; [a]
 preOrder Nil &#x3D; []
 preOrder (Node x lt rt) &#x3D; x: ((preOrder lt) ++ (preOrder rt ))
 it seems to work, but I&#x27;m struggeling with the levelOrder function, I just have:
 levelOrder :: BTree a -&gt; [a]
 levelOrder Nil &#x3D; []
 levelOrder (Node x lt rt) &#x3D;
 I dont know what to do next to make it work.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am looking for two functions where once &quot;notElem&quot; and once &quot;concat&quot; have been implemented. I can&#x27;t find any functions where it would be useful to implement these two functions. It can also be a very short function.
 ​
 Thanks a lot

                              <span>I have a library which I&#x27;m writing and I want to host the Haddock documentation on my website. Everything in that regard is fine, but I was hoping to be able to add some text beyond just the project synopsis to the index.html page that Haddock generates since it will be the landing page for anyone looking at the documentation.
 Is there any extra file I can add or a field somewhere in which I can put Haddock comments and have them added to the top of that page above the list of modules, or is it limited to just showing the synopsis in the .cabal file?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working as a JS developer, at my job I mostly do vanilla JS on an electron app and on personal projects I worked with React, Express and Mongodb too.
 I&#x27;m wondering if I should take the Scala offer since there are less jobs for Scala than there are for JS. Will it be a good career move to switch to Scala? I only have 1 year of experience as a dev so making the switch wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal. 
 PS: I&#x27;m in Europe so that probably means the number of available jobs is even lower

                              <span>WebAssembly is gaining momentum in all fields but especially around backend and as a potential replacement for containers. Many languages have good Wasm stories. Ex Rust, Go, C# and even Haskell got it recently. Scala has mostly become a backend programming language even though it has potential for other areas. Is Scala falling behind with the lack of WebAssembly support?

                              <span>This is not exactly about Zettelkasten and knowledge work. But since music is part of the work environment, this might be interesting to you. This is a note that I took yesterday (translated by DeepL):

  
Good music is made to give us strength. Old war music, a lot of video game music, some movie music.
Other music is made for us to give it power. Pop music is made to be about itself. It&#x27;s all about itself. It wants us to focus our attention on it.
Listen to good music!
Music is part of the cultural environment of us humans. It is the most primal form of cultural transmission of meaning. It is (without singing) meaning in its purest form: Harmony through form in form in form.


I have no study to provide evidence for my thesis. However, my n&#x3D;1 is very positive. I, personally, like to listen to traditional war music. Now, that I started my cold adaptation (cold shower + shiver walks aftwards (walking in cold with few clothes on)) I feel like nordic war music is appropriate.
But gaming music is my personal favorite. For people, that don&#x27;t like to listen to music at all: Ambience sounds like campfire sounds, thunder and rain etc. are also power giving.
I like this more than binaural sounds. And my old Celtic/Germanic/Rus genes seem to like it, too.

                              <span>I’ve recently been learning how to use Bazel and Nix
to build projects. Reading documentation and playing around with codelab
exercises is a great way to get started, but when learning a new
technology there comes a point where you have to start applying it for real to
make further progress. To this end I decided to migrate an old hobby project of
mine to use Bazel. This post describes my experience and I hope serves as a
useful example for others.
Bazel is a fantastic build system which by itself provides many
benefits. However dependency management could be
considered an area of weakness for it. This is understandable given its
monorepo origins at Google but when not working in a monorepo, what
is the best way to provide the dependencies a project needs?

                              <span>I use Bookmarks+, a superb package. But for some reason the status message face when I want to delete a bookmark is night unreadable, and although I can customize all the faces that appear in my actual bookmark list, I cannot figure out how to change that one. So, in principle, how do I find out what face is causing the ugliness when it&#x27;s in my status bar (so I can&#x27;t do the usual inspecting)? The image of the style I need to change is at https://images.toryanderson.com/bookmark-delete-face.png. How do I locate the face so I can change it?

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been developing a package for my own use to give suggestions while typing. While there are packages that do this, I couldn&#x27;t find any that were aimed at my use case exactly.
 That is, to suggest something useful while typing based on the current context.
 At the moment I have this setup so there are multiple back-ends which can be enabled at once based on the current context, this way I can have different suggestions based on what I&#x27;m working on so:
  
When typing in code, suggest using code completion or dabbrev.
 When typing in comments, suggest using statistical word prediction, falling back to dabbrev.
  
I&#x27;ve been interested in how good word prediction can be, at the moment I&#x27;m using N-gram&#x27;s generated by code-comments of the project I&#x27;m working on as input as well as every commit message, the user-manual and some NLTK texts as well. So far it&#x27;s quite nice but doesn&#x27;t feel like a game-changer and might need some tweaking to improve it&#x27;s behavior.
 While I&#x27;m aware other auto-completion frameworks might support this functionality, I find it useful to separate blocking completion from this kind of suggestion generation.
 Is anyone doing something similar in Emacs already, any comments?
  
This is the repository if anyone is interested although this isn&#x27;t yet documented and internals may change.

 Im currently using brave, which automatically blocks all ads and trackers, and (or so they claim) does not fingerprint or record your online activity.

 Or would it be possible to run the Brave browser in Emacs?

 Im currently using brave, which automatically blocks all ads and trackers, and (or so they claim) does not fingerprint or record your online activity.
 ​
 Or would it be possible to run the Brave browser in Emacs?

                              <span>The great goodness of Emacs has tainted how I feel about my shell. I use Vertico+Marginalia+Consult+Orderless, and life feels awesome inside of Emacs. I go back to my pretty vanilla zsh shell and feel that it&#x27;s a little… lacking.
 I understand zsh&#x27;s completion system is quite configurable. I&#x27;d love it if I could make completion inside of zsh feel more like how it behaves in Emacs. In particular:
  
When I hit tab to complete something, I want to be able to hit the down key to start cycling through the candidates.
 When I find the candidate I want, tab should fill it in instead of moving to the next candidate.
 If I&#x27;m completing a path, after hitting tab whilst completing a directory, I should immediately see the contents of that directory, which I can then pick the file I want and hit tab again.
 Fuzzy completion ala Orderless would be awesome: hitting space during completion acts as a pattern separator.
  
Does anyone have enough zsh-fu to know how to get something like what I described in the shell? I would prefer to do everything with configuration (i.e. no packages) but that&#x27;s secondary to getting the behavior that I want.
 Thanks in advance. :)

 it&#x27;s a while i&#x27;m trying to make the native version of emacs in windows (not the cygwin one) run term or ansi-term but i always get the &quot;spawning child process: invalid argument&quot;. i know that using the cygwin version solve this problem but it has other disadvantages.
 Do you know any solution or a workaround to this issue?

I&#x27;ve noticed that changing the headline (i.e. date, tags) will break the link and it will try to make a new headline (prompting do you want to create...) in the file instead. 
 Do you link between your org files?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use volar with some nuxt3 projects and having major issues with cpu usage spiking out of control, even with most of the fancy lsp-mode features disabled. Just typing and navigating vue files is causing freezes of several seconds. 
 It&#x27;s completely unusable to the point where I&#x27;m just giving up on lsp in vue for now so I can get some work done.
 LSP mode is fine otherwise in plain typescript files.
 Has anyone had the same experience? Not looking for solutions neccassirily, just wondering if it&#x27;s worth it for me to debug further, whether it&#x27;s even possible to have a pleasant experience with volar right now.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in virtual formatting of code, that is that the code doesn&#x27;t contain (almost) any formatting, and the editor parses the code and lays it out according to its structure and some layout rules.
 You can read more about virtual formatting on the site of XMLQuire.
 Virtual formatting isn&#x27;t that the editor parses the code and formats it by inserting whitespace; the text is not modified, it&#x27;s just laid out on the screen to reflect its structure.
 How could that be achieved in Emacs? I didn&#x27;t find any editor capable of that for multiple languages, and Emacs has surprised me multiple times with what is possible in it, so I have hope that it is possible in Emacs.

                              <span>With normal parser combinators, running the parsers normally gives you something along the lines of Either ParserError a. This prevents laziness as you need pattern match on this to use it and doing so will force evaluation on whether or not the parse resulted in an error.
 Are there any parser combinators that are lazy instead, letting you use partial parses and using imprecise exceptions for parser errors?
 Here&#x27;s some (old) code where I play around with this:
 {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-} {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-} module Parse where import Control.Applicative import Control.Monad import Data.Char data Status &#x3D; Empty | Pure | Parse deriving (Show) data Result a &#x3D; Parsed { value :: a, remaining :: String, status :: Status } deriving (Functor, Show) newtype Parser a &#x3D; Parser {runParser :: String -&gt; Result a} deriving (Functor) instance Applicative Parser where pure &#x3D; return () &#x3D; ap instance Monad Parser where return x &#x3D; Parser $ \str -&gt; Parsed x str Pure Parser p &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; Parser $ \str -&gt; case p str of Parsed a str Pure -&gt; runParser (f a) str Parsed _ str Empty -&gt; Parsed (error &quot;parse error&quot;) str Empty Parsed a str Parse -&gt; case runParser (f a) str of ~(Parsed b str _) -&gt; Parsed b str Parse instance Alternative Parser where empty &#x3D; Parser $ \str -&gt; Parsed (error &quot;parse error&quot;) str Empty Parser p  Parser q &#x3D; Parser $ \str -&gt; case p str of Parsed _ _ Empty -&gt; q str result -&gt; result satify :: (Char -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Parser Char satify f &#x3D; Parser $ \case c : s | f c -&gt; Parsed c s Parse str -&gt; Parsed (error &quot;parse error&quot;) str Empty number :: Parser Char number &#x3D; satify isDigit test :: Char test &#x3D; head $ value $ runParser (many number) (&#x27;1&#x27; : &#x27;2&#x27; : &#x27;3&#x27; : undefined)

 During Haskell eXchange Novice Track I did a talk about Semigroup, Monoid, Foldable and Traversable. This talk is for beginners that are familiar with basic Haskell syntax. Enjoy :)
 —
 &quot;In this session you will learn about three heroes: Monoid (and its side-kick Semigroup), Foldable and Traversable. Three amazing type-classes, each providing a set of astonishing powers, making your daily programming routines easy as pie.
 During the talk we will encounter numerous villains (a.k.a programming riddles). Though the baddies look tough at the first glance, we will quickly learn that with the help of our protagonists, defeating those villains is a child&#x27;s play. Are you ready to meet our heroes and master their powers?
 The talk is appropriate for Haskell beginners. We assume familiarity with basic Haskell syntax (functions, data types, typeclasses).&quot;

 I&#x27;m looking for exactly such a dataframe library that organizes in-memory data in form of column Vectors. And reading from .csv files considered a requirement.
 Or other choices you would recommend?

 What does it means for a number to be integral?
 Most resources suggest integrals are similar to integers. But is it the case with Scala as well?

                              <span>For many years (since 2017), Veautiful and Doctacular have been published to GitHub and I&#x27;ve just used them via JitPack
 Over the last month or so, I&#x27;ve started publishing them to Maven Central to make them more accessible to others, especially now scala-cli supports Scala.js very well. 
 0.3-M4 is on Maven Central now.
 Veautiful is a Scala.js front end I wrote originally in 2017 and have used for writing interactive learning materials since then. 
 Doctacular is a simple set of classes (e.g. router and handling for basic content types, site layout, and table of contents) that make it easy for me to write interactive learning materials. Doctactular is ironically under-documented, but these are some of the sites built with it (albeit several of these are still running on the previous version):
  
Thinking about Programming, a CS0-style resource with programmable games (turtle, lava maze, rescue line, microrat, lunar lander)
 Circuits Up, mostly interactive visualisations of simple circuitry and digital logic
 The Adventures of Will Scala, my Scala course
 Supercollaborative, essentially, second year undergrad software engineering
 My ASCILITE 2022 talk on lightweight course mapping 
  
0.3-M5 will follow soon. (As will another of these posts announcing it.) 0.3-M5 will focus on improving the docs for Doctacular.

                              <span>I’m working on this pet project for a time now. Initially based on the three-layer repository, it’s now modelled after the Clean Architecture. In my understanding, it’s an OOP variation of the functional “Functional Core, Imperative Shell” approach. As most examples for Clean Architecture are written in C#, my module structure also looks more like a typical C# than Haskell one to me.
 Could you please help me in haskellizing my project? I found mainly resources about how to structure Haskell libraries not applications. Of course, I’m also thankful for other tips. This is my first serious Haskell project and I love working on it and improving it :)

                              <span>A goldsmith has chain links of gold, silver, and platinum and can form chains from them.
 The following holds for the chains:
 i) Each chain has a beginning (left side) and an end (right side).
 ii) An empty chain is a chain
 iii) The end of a chain ch1 can be connected to the beginning of a chain ch by a chain link 1.
 We have following data types:
 data Link &#x3D; G | S | P deriving (Eq, Show)
 data Chain &#x3D; Empty | Join Chain Link Chain
 Task: We want to implement a function list :: Chain -&gt; [Link] to determine the material sequence from left to right.
 The test chain we created is: chain1 &#x3D; (Join Empty G (Join Empty G (Join Empty P (Empty))))so the function should give [G,G,P] as a result, when the input is list chain1
 How should the list function look like? We have trouble creating one.
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>Org-roam is amazing, and I really wish if I can organize my hard drive files similarly, or even in any means of &#x27;organization&#x27; because they are really misused up, and hierarchical directories never worked for me. Is there any partial tool/workflow you guys use? 
 I tried to use org-roam and mention file links inside some nodes, but this one also has gone painful because whenever I remove a file I&#x27;ve to update its nodes

 Last years I enjoyed Let it snow and a cozy fireplace during this time of year.
 They haven&#x27;t got any updates lately, but they are still fun, especially with native comp enabled. You can get them through MELPA.

                              <span>I have a config (literate via org-babel) that I&#x27;m pretty happy with. I did a very manual setup on my work pc which uses windows (i&#x27;m not a dev yet so stuck with windows at my current marketing job). 
 The problem is as I make new strides on my home config I cannot easily mirror the setup at work. On top of that I am also working on going all-in on org mode across my devices. I can figure out the org file syncing with syncthing no problem but as I develop my org setup I don&#x27;t want to be having disparate versions of my config. 
 Are there any guides or walkthroughs on this type of thing? I know I&quot;ll probably need to figure several things out based on my specific setup but figure there might be something out there like resolving moving between the ~/ and C:/ locations and any other issues I might not realize I&#x27;d run into.

                              <span>Does anyone know if anyone ever tried to write a text editor (or something else, or an Emacs extension) where shortcuts were based on the physical position of a key, instead of which key it is?
 The context is that most editors (including Emacs and vim) have issues when used on non-US keyboards, because stuff is in different places. Many people solve this problem by switching to a US keyboard (which has some other advantages), but I don&#x27;t really like this solution.
 I can see some challenges for this, like the differences between 104 and 105 key layouts, etc. And this is more from a theoretical standpoint....

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to share a subset of my org notes to co-workers by exporting them in html files that are linked together, with one entrypoint which is an org note that I manage to keep up to date with the project state. But I have hundreds of org notes, all in the same directory, so I can&#x27;t juste use the org-publish :recursive t option.
 What I would like is an option to specify one (or many) org-files to be included and then that the export process follow all links inside the given files (currently org-roam links) and try to included those linked files too.
 Is something like this already exist ? (I&#x27;ve search but not found anything relevant to my need) And if not, what should be my firsts steps to make it work as I wish (I&#x27;m fairly new to org publish process).
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hey, all. Here&#x27;s something easy i&#x27;ve been doing for the past few years to avoid typing the underscore.
 (defun gopar/easy-underscore (arg) &quot;Convert all inputs of semicolon to an underscore. If given ARG, then it will insert an actual semicolon.&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (if arg (insert &quot;;&quot;) (insert &quot;_&quot;))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;;&quot;) &#x27;gopar/easy-underscore) 
 If you do C-u ; then you get a normal semicolon.
 
 I was doing the same thing with JS where if I type the semicolon twice, it will insert a semicolon but if I type a letter it will automatically uppercase it for camelCase.
 (defun easy-camelcase (arg) (interactive &quot;c&quot;) ;; arg is between a-z (cond ((and (&gt;&#x3D; arg 97) (&lt;&#x3D; arg 122)) (insert (capitalize (char-to-string arg)))) ;; If it&#x27;s a new line ((&#x3D; arg 13) (newline-and-indent)) ((&#x3D; arg 59) (insert &quot;;&quot;)) ;; We probably meant a key command, so lets execute that (t (call-interactively (lookup-key (current-global-map) (char-to-string arg)))))) 
 ​
 Ya&#x27;ll have anything like that worth sharing? :)

                              <span>I think my start up times are slow because:
  
I have not designed by self-written features to delay loading until they are required because I don&#x27;t now how
 
because I&#x27;m not using use-package properly, ie adding the :bind etc that delays the loading of packages till their needed.
 
 In case of my own features, ie those I load with require how do delay them until they are required?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ve hacked together some functions to recreate the vimium functionality inside of EWW. Sadly I never had interest into making this into a package. (Also there are some quirks/bugs that would need to be fleshed out but works fine for me most of the time.)
 Anyone interested in turning it into one? You can copy and pasta the code as a starting point, and all the glory will be yours to release :)

                              <span>(I was so proud working up an org init file to share with everyone, I&#x27;ve been starting at the beginning and everything was going great, and this morning I wake up to a strange glitch after working on the plane...)
 ​
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/Users/me/.emacs.d/init.el’: : Please save the current buffer to a file 
 And if I do a load-file manually then the same error occurs. But if I load the init.el into a buffer, do nothing else but load-file then it all works. As does eval-buffer and the other manual ways to run it. So load-file init.el nothing, C-x C-f init.el, load-file init.el works. It works both from ~/ and from /Users/... --debug-init does nothing, and my
 (message &quot;entering init.el&quot;) 
 at the top doesn&#x27;t get hit when it fails. This started when somehow my init.el seemed to be gone (no clue how) -- so I did a revert-file in the buffer to get a copy back (per the message, save the buffer). It&#x27;s as if emacs is stuck in some state of not knowing the init.el file exists -- but that seems like nonsense.
 ​
 Thanks for any help or troubleshooting. The fact that the opening message and debug-init do nothing makes me think the file isn&#x27;t even getting seen at startup.

 I personally run my own config and use traditional Emacs bindings. I&#x27;m familiar with Doom and Spacemacs, but I&#x27;m also wondering if I should just write him a simple conf that&#x27;s pretty much just vanilla + evil + lsp-mode/eglot and maybe a theme. Are there any must have packages besides evil-mode to get him a familiar editing experience? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m midstream in contributing Ruby Tree Sitter Mode to FSF. I thought I would mention it here because I&#x27;d like to get more people trying it out and seeing if it is complete, etc.
 Tree sitter brings a whole new level of possibilities that I&#x27;d also like to get feedback on. For example, elements of an array could be right aligned. Enhanced Ruby mode currently implements two choices: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ruby ENH_CONST1 &#x3D; [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15 ].freeze
 ENH_CONST2 &#x3D; [12, 999, 13, 14, 15].freeze  Both of these are aligned along a left edge -- which is fine. But another choice that I&#x27;ve implemented just as a proof of concept is having these right aligned such as:  ruby RIGHT_ALIGNED_CONST1 &#x3D; [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15 ].freeze
 RIGHT_ALIGNED_CONST2 &#x3D; [ 12, 999, 13, 14, 15].freeze &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have not implemented it yet bu…</span>

  spit-window-below other-window (Change to the new window) ansi-term /bin/bash other-window (Change back to main-buffer) 
 I almost got the first 2 but there is something I&#x27;m clearly misunderstanding. I got this script
  (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (kill-buffer &quot;*scratch*&quot;) (split-window-below) (other-window) (ansi-term &quot;/bin/bash&quot;) (other-window) )) 
 Which splits the window in half and nothing more. I&#x27;m guessing there is something I&#x27;m missing about the other-window because if I comment these 2 out, my final output is emacs opening with ansi-term at the top and main window at the bottom.
 TLDR: How do I configure emacs to have the main-window at the top and ansi-term &quot;/bin/bash&quot; at the bottom on start-up
 Edit: I&#x27;m getting this error in debug: Wrong number of arguments: (1 . 2), 0
 Fixed. Apparently other-window requires an argument.
  (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (kill-buffer &quot;*scratch*&quot;) (split-window-below) (other-window 1) ; Go to the new window (ansi-term &quot;/bin/bash&quot;) (other-window 0) ; Back to main window ))

 I created a ~/.emacs (there was none before that &quot;(global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-[ f&quot;) &#x27;move-end-of-line)
 Ok, that moves me to the end of the line, but it also highlights all the text I moved over.
 whereas M-x move-end-of-line just moves the cursor to the end of the line.
 I am a very emacs noob, so I apologize if I am asking my question improperly. I have looked at several websites to find what I could find but I just can&#x27;t seem to make it work. 
 I have since removed the ~/.emacs file
 ​
 Here is a new bit of news - I just found out the problem is only under the GUI in a terminal (Qterminal in LXQT) The CLI (non-X) pseudo terminals don&#x27;t have this issue.
 C-e and C-a actually work but on my other machines and in text-only mode (non-X) on this machine [home] and [end] serve to go to the beginning and end of the line I am on.

                              <span>I recently joined a company that publishes a library compatible for Scala 2.12. I&#x27;ve been trying to find guidance about Scala 2.12 and 2.13 for library maintainers. I found this for Scala 3: https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2022/08/17/long-term-compatibility-plans.html and it&#x27;s very helpful. Is there anything similar for 2.12/2.13? 
 A few things I&#x27;m trying to understand:
  
It seems 2.12 and 2.13 are being supported concurrently. What is the reason for this? Is there any public guidance for how long 2.12 or 2.13 will be supported? 
 Generally speaking, can a Scala 2.12 project be compiled to Scala 2.13?
 Given the latest release is now 3.2, is support for 2.13 worthwhile? (Subjective I know but curious what the community&#x27;s sentiment is regarding 2.13).
  
Any additional thoughts that might be helpful for someone in my position and new to the Scala ecosystem would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>My question:
 I want to separate my code logic from Scala Future. After searching and reading some articles, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s recommendation to achieve this?
 Background:
 I have a project where it heavily depends on Future for operations. I have no problem with that. However, when writing the code, I want to be able to, for instance, test my logic instead of testing against Future. Also I know there exist libraries like ZIO, cats-effects, Monix, and Fs2. I may use it in the future. Before that happens, I don&#x27;t want to choose one or the others too early. Then I found some articles talking about tagless final; but there are also some caveats regarding to applying tagless final such as complexity.
 ​
 Any advice that I can apply for decoupling my code&#x27;s business logic from Future in a simpler way? Would simply provide a thunk (method or function) do the trick? For example, &#x60;Future { myFunc() }&#x60; - but with this it looks like the next step or function that handles this still couples with Future object. I appreciate any advice. Many thanks.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m new in FS2, and looks like I need some help by getting some entry points or tips on how to implement it by using FS2 next system with the next sub-systems:
 subsystem A: (many instances) just some constant network consumer (one to each peer) with some logic, the result shall be put into some shared storage; also, that subsystem shall send information about of &quot;quality&quot; of consumed data to subsystem C.
 subsystem B: (one instance), consume data from subsystems A send consumed and transformed data to some external subsystem, send information about of &quot;quality&quot; of consumed data to subsystem C
 subsystem C: (one instance) open/close network connection, based on data &quot;quality&quot; information received from A/B.
 ​
 I easily understand how to implement a such system by using Akka actors/messages (every subsystem is just an actor with appropriate messages). But How it could be implemented on FS2? Making every subsystem as a stream is fitting very well, but I&#x27;m stuck on how to make such interactions and communications between subsystems. Of course, I could &quot;emulate&quot; actors (for example https://www.signifytechnology.com/blog/2019/10/replacing-akka-actors-with-cats-effect-and-fs2-by-viktor-lovgren ). Or somehow use reactive streams for it. But maybe I just missing something and there is exist a convenient way to do it?

                              <span>Apparently this was presented at Functional Scala this year: https://github.com/zio/zio-direct.
 Instead of:
 for { textA &lt;- read(fileA) textB &lt;- read(fileB) _ &lt;- write(fileC, textA + textB) } yield () 
 you can do:
 import zio.direct._ defer { val textA &#x3D; read(fileA).run val textB &#x3D; read(fileB).run write(fileC, textA + textB) } 
 I&#x27;ve been giving it a try and have found it&#x27;s worked better than I expected it to. Metals has no problem inferring the types of any of the channels. (I&#x27;m using scala 3)

                              <span>Hi Zettelauts!
I want to share a method of searching for candidates to link ideas in a new note to established ideas that consistently produce high-quality results. This advanced search option is called proximity search. Usually, proximity search has to be implemented at the software level. My main goal is to share this idea with you.
I love making lists, so you&#x27;ll have to suffer my indulgence.
Background
I use The Archive to host my ZK.
I have 3K+ zettel, but you&#x27;ll find this tool of use if you have more than a couple hundred.
My notes are all plain text formatted with Markdown.
I use and recommend Keyboard Maestro integrated with python and zsh scripts.
There are other ways to accomplish the same outcomes using other macro and scripting tools.
I&#x27;m dividing this demo into three parts.

During the process, I reviewed the overview note for the book that I created in my video series.
I have a couple of things planned to break this long note up. I also faintly recall the urge to refactor parts, i.e. stopping to stick to the chapters, and instead re-group the bullet points below per topic.
I don&#x27;t expect anyone to read this word-by-word 
Do you share the feeling that this is overwhelmingly long?
Did you read the book and have a different structure?

Introduction
Epstein positions his arguments to refute the a claim of the 10000-hour-rule camp of getting expertise: that more time and deliberate practice is all there is.

I am at the limits of my knowledge: Is there a possibility to create a bigger entry window in Keyboard Maestro? My goal is to somehow create a quick entry window (append text to file).
Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>With their introduction in Nix 2.4, flakes are quickly becoming an integral part of the Nix ecosystem. For anyone unfamiliar, flakes exist to provide a standard format to package Nix-based projects.
To allow for better user experience and composability for existing flakes, discoverability of flakes is a necessary feature.
The site search.nixos.org is used to search for packages, options, and flakes. It also provides metadata information such as descriptions, maintainers, and compatible platforms.
Currently, search.nixos.org imports flake metadata through custom nix code that wraps flake evaluations. However, wrapping employs too much memory when used with large repositories such as nixpkgs. This causes a segmentation fault. As currently implemented, search.nixos.org cannot show all flakes.…</span>

                              <span>Being a newbie to linux one of my first major decisions seems to be Vim vs Emacs.
 I&#x27;ve been looking around and I can find a lot of documentation on how to get started with emacs. But I still don&#x27;t understand, what actually is it?
 Vim can be described as a modal terminal text editor.
 But what is emacs?
 As far as I can tell it seems to be much more than just a text editor, right?
 Could you use it as a terminal text editor? Or do I have to use the GUI?
 Apart from editing text what else does it do?
 There seem to be a lot of things you can do with Emacs that you cant do with Vim.
 But is there anything you can do with Vim that you cant do with Emacs?
 For example the modal editing stuff?

 (use-package corfu :custom (corfu-cycle t) :init (global-corfu-mode)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; I haven&#x27;t changed anything in sly.

                              <span>When I&#x27;m running multiple instances of the same .emacs.d configuration on different projects simultaneously some of the settings files like recentf and the history file created by savehist can and do conflict with each other.
 Does Emacs have a way of enabling the user of a particular .emacs.d but allow the project or session settings to be separate? Creating doom profiles for each user account does get time consuming.
 I have been able to create some workarounds for such issues, such as this way of setting a separate custom.el file when I run a profile copied to different user accounts on different computers.
 (setq custom-file (format (expand-file-name &quot;%s-%s-cukstom.el&quot; user-emacs-directory) (getenv &quot;USER&quot;) (getenv &quot;HOST&quot;))) 
 I have noticed that Emacs has a command-line option --user that allows the usage an .emacs.d belonging to another user which would help avoiding replicating .emacs.d for different user accounts and going through whole doom compilations, but I need something for the particular .emacs.d as well as the project.
 Is there some package that makes such things easier? I already user Chemacs2 to keep the .emacs.d options separate, but this needs to be on a project or directory basis, ie profile + project/working directory

                              <span>There are lots of conversion options? but none of popular office formats. Is there any way I can export org files to docx?

                              <span>I recently switched my config over to the (very!) aesthetically pleasing and nicely usable emacs nano. Already using it as a daily driver and very happy with it UX-wise, though I still have a thing (and a reported bug) keeping it from being near-ideal.
 Math-preview (using the new one with MathJax3), which I rely on heavily on latex when taking notes for astrophysics formulas and, well... math. ¯\(ツ)/¯ Math-preview just gives a blank little box (smaller than formula&#x27;s expansion) where the formulas should go despite the fact I have it triggered on all pages with formulas via this:
 elisp (use-package math-preview :straight t :custom (math-preview-command &quot;/opt/homebrew/bin/math-preview&quot;)) (setq math-preview-scale 1.75) (setq math-preview-tex-marks-inline &#x27;((&quot;$$&quot; &quot;$$&quot;))) (setq math-preview-tex-marks &#x27;((&quot;\\begin{equation}&quot; &quot;\\end{equation}&quot;) (&quot;\\begin{equation*}&quot; &quot;\\end{equation*}&quot;) (&quot;$$&quot; &quot;$$&quot;) )) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook #&#x27;math-preview-all) 
 modification in custom so that it does not trigger on pages talking about money and only explicitly on a double $$ in case people were wondering. As you can probably tell from the preview command I&#x27;m on an M1 OSX system and straight as my package manager. This block works in my other config, so unsure if it&#x27;s related to the fact nano uses fixed width in the main text (whereas I had variable pitch in my other config... or some other factor. Any insights appreciated.).
 I do notice that nano does some implicit (and nice!) rendering of things like CO_2 and sub and superscripts automatically inline typing, but this problem relates directly to complex math formula rendering. 
 Anyone got it working with nano?

 * 2022
 ** 2022-10 October
 *** 2022-10-07 Friday
 - [ ] My captured item
 However I would like to add a summary of the number of items in the checklist to the final node in the tree so it looks like this. 
 * 2022
 ** 2022-10 October
 *** 2022-10-07 Friday [1/2]
 - [ ] My captured item
 - [X] Second captured item
 My current template which creates the first example looks like this:
 &#x27;((&quot;t&quot; &quot;Todo&quot; checkitem
 (file+datetree+prompt &quot;~/org-mode/todo.org&quot;)
 &quot;- [ ] %^{Todo}&quot; :tree-type week)
 Any suggestion how I can achieve what I want?

 https://r2dbc.io/
 Do you use this type of drivers to access RDBMSes in your scala projects? They seem popular with other java based frameworks, such as Vert.x, Quarkus, but not so much in the scala world. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m really struggling to get scalafmt to remove end-markers in a large scala3 project - does anyone have the full incantation for what&#x27;s required to automatically rewrite them back to whitespace (well, specifically back to -noindent, but one step at a time I suppose)?
 (Note: It&#x27;s OK if you like end-markers, this is not a value-jugement on the nature of end-markers)

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m fairly new to Haskell and am struggling with how to ensure type safety of my domain model. I&#x27;m modelling &quot;Weather Station&quot;, which currently looks as follows:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data MeasurementType &#x3D; Rain | Humidity | Pressure | Temperature | WindStrength | WindAngle | GustStrength | GustAngle
 data Measurement &#x3D; MeasuredRain (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredHumidity (Double) | MeasuredPressure (Pascal) | MeasuredTemperature (Kelvin) | MeasuredWindStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredWindAngle (Degree) | MeasuredGustStrength (Meter :/ Hour) | MeasuredGustAngle (Degree) 
 data TimeSeries &#x3D; TimeSeries { measuredProperty:: MeasurementType, values:: Map UTCTime Measurement }
 data Sensor a &#x3D; Sensor { identifier :: a, supportedMeasurements :: [Core.MeasurementType] }
 -- each sensor supports different measurement types, ideally it should also be type checked type GetMeasurements a &#x3D; Sensor a -&gt; TimeRange -&gt; NonEmpty MeasurementType -&gt; IO [TimeSeries] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What I would like to achieve is to ensure TimeSeries measuredProperty match Measurement type. That is, it shouldn&#x27;t compile when one tries to create time serie of type Rain while putting e.g. MeasuredWindAngle inside.
 The measuredProperty is needed to group time series and e.g. compute an average from each serie type. That is, separate average for Humidity, Rain etc..
 Basically, each weather sensor will return many different measurements, where the measurements can be duplicated among different sensors. Therefore, I&#x27;d like to combine all measurements into a single list, group by type and then aggregate.
 Moreover, each sensor has a different set of supported measurements. Ideally, this should be reflected in the type system as well. That is, one shouldn&#x27;t be able to ask for Pressure where the given sensor only supports [Temperature, Humidity].
 Anyone can give me any clues on how to achieve this?

 I&#x27;d say my trajectory of experiencing programming languages was pretty common for a regular CS undergrad. Started off with Java, everything was new, many things felt weird and difficult (because they are), but I accepted them blindly and was happy. Other lectures required me to code in Python, C and C++. The amount of work required for the lectures prevented me from diving deeper into any language than what was required, but they all seemed to be decent with their individual benefits and drawbacks.
 But then came Haskell, it felt like an enlightenment. The mathematical beauty, the expressive type system, the declarative, composable nature …</span>

                              <span>[I also posted this question on the Haskell discourse]
 Macs represent 1/3 of development platforms and deployment targets for Haskellers, but I myself haven&#x27;t used a Mac in about 15 years. I would like to know what it&#x27;s like to work with Haskell on a Mac.
 I&#x27;d like to ask about one aspect of the experience in particular: getting set up. And the specific reason I&#x27;m asking about this is that notarizing GHC for Macs is currently on the to-do list.
 Notarization is part of Apple&#x27;s fight against malware. Codesigning is another. I am still learning how they work and what the consequences are.
 Does the lack of a notarized installable affect you? (Example of missing notarization here.) If so, how? It helps to be specific: Did you get started with GHCUp? Stack? Something else?
 What other pain points exist when you (or your students/classmates/colleagues/bosses) get set up to work with Haskell? What&#x27;s the biggest pain point?
 I&#x27;ll have access to a Mac soon, but I don&#x27;t want to base my effort on one data point. :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I want to run Simulations (like TestSuites) that I can run with sbt test. 
 I found the interface that I need to implement: https://github.com/sbt/test-interface
 As I did not find any documentation, I checked existing Frameworks.
 They had in common to use org.portablescala.reflect.annotation.EnableReflectiveInstantiation to discover Test classes (I think that is my missing point). 
 But this does not work with Scala 3. Does anyone know a Test Framework that uses Scala 3, or better has some instructions on how to implement the sbt interface? 
 Here is my dummy implementation so far. When adding the testFramework to sbt it seems to be picked, but nothing really happens (see printlns - PRINTED vs. NOT PRINTED ): 
 final class SimulationTestFramework extends Framework: val name: String &#x3D; &quot;CSimulation&quot; val fingerprints: Array[Fingerprint] &#x3D; Array(SimulationFingerprint) println(s&quot;SimulationTestFramework started&quot;) // PRINTED def runner( args: Array[String], remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ): SimulationRunner &#x3D; println(&quot;TestRunner started&quot;) // NOT PRINTED new SimulationRunner(args, remoteArgs, testClassLoader) end SimulationTestFramework object SimulationFingerprint extends SubclassFingerprint: def superclassName(): String &#x3D; &quot;camundala.simulation.custom.CustomSimulation&quot; final def isModule() &#x3D; true final def requireNoArgConstructor() &#x3D; false println(s&quot;Simulation Fingerprint for ${superclassName()}&quot;) // PRINTED final class SimulationRunner( val args: Array[String], val remoteArgs: Array[String], testClassLoader: ClassLoader ) extends Runner: override def tasks(taskDefs: Array[TaskDef]): Array[sbt.testing.Task] &#x3D; { println(&quot;TASKS&quot;) // NOT PRINTED Array() } override def done(): String &#x3D; println(&quot;it is done&quot;) // NOT PRINTED &quot;ok down&quot; end SimulationRunner

 One feature would be to invoke a function that replaces a function call with an intermediate function that takes the named parameters, presenting a dialog where you enter the parameters.
 The idea is not to replace the function itself but use some kind generic function that can do it for any function.
 eg if a function defined as (defun dofunc a b c) it gets replaced by (param-call &#x27;dofunc :a a-param :b b-param c: c-param) and presents a dialog for it.
 Any such thing in the Emacs universe?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to run some shell block code (in windows they should evaluate in cmd). But when executing org-babel block code, it seems that org-babel is not finishing last command. If I run:
 #+begin_src shell :results output echo %cd% echo &quot;hello&quot; #+end_src 
 then the output is 
 #+RESULTS: : Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.2251] : (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. : : c:\Users\johndoe\Org&gt;echo %cd% : c:\Users\johndoe\Org : : c:\Users\johndoe\Org&gt;More? 
 More? means cmd is expecting some additional command (creating multiline statemens). In cmd typying either ( or ^ result in More?, but I don&#x27;t know what is causing this error in org-babel. Interestingly, if run like this:
 #+begin_src shell :results output :session shell echo &quot;%cd%&quot; echo &quot;hello&quot; #+end_src 
 I&#x27;m getting the right output:
 #+RESULTS: : Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.2251] : (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. : echo &quot;%cd%&quot; : &quot;c:\Users\johndoe\Org&quot; : echo &quot;hello&quot; : &quot;hello&quot; 
 But only when run for the first time, if running for second time, I&#x27;m getting this:
 #+RESULTS: : : cd%&quot; : &quot;c:\Users\johndoe\Org&quot; : echo &quot;hello&quot; : &quot;hello&quot;

                              <span>So I refused to install VS Code in this laptop and default to Emacs for everything. I used vanilla Emacs without many issues for a while, but decided to use Prelude yesterday.
 Oh, it&#x27;s so nice, but at the same time... I know I can disable guru-mode, plus customize the few things that irk me... but maybe there&#x27;s a better starter kit?
 My objectives are:
  
No modal editing: I know vim basics, but I don&#x27;t want a modal editor.
 I work most frequently with Python, Java, and Rust. Prolog, Puppet, Ansible I also do frequently. Wide language support would be nice. I&#x27;m a believer of LSP, so I&#x27;d like to use LSP.
 I write a lot of AsciiDoc for work. Being able to integrate aspell and Vale would be a big plus (recommended plugin for Vale is https://github.com/tpeacock19/flymake-vale , which is not in MELPA- maybe a straight.el-using starter kit would be helpful? Or perhaps I should just submodule/subtree/subrepo it?)
 Reasonably similar to vanilla Emacs- I don&#x27;t want to be too lost without my configuration.
 Multi-account email client? I already mbsync two personal accounts (GMail and Yahoo) for backup purposes, might consider handling work email in Emacs too.
 I work significantly on RHEL 8 systems, which ship Emacs 26.1, and also on a RHEL 9 box (27.1).
  
Thoughts, suggestions?

                              <span>I am using Emacs 26.3 on Xubuntu 20.04. I installed pyvenv while installing elpy. But pyvenv is not working with eshell.
 First I created a new virtual environment using pyvenv-create in ~/.virtualenvs/venv then I opened eshell and then ran pyvenv-activate and provided the above virtual environment path. The mode line was also showing something like .virtualenvs near eshell.
 But when I ran which python in eshell then It was showing me the default python directory and not that from virtual environment from the above path.
 I also checked for sys.path in python interactive shell but nothing changed.
 Please suggest me how to fix this or what wrong I did.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m still fairly new to emacs, and usually I&#x27;d solve this problem myself, but I am honestly overwhelmed. When I search for emacs customizations, I&#x27;m curious how to enable flymake for basic linting, i.e. underlining forgotten semicolons i.e. Now, emacs does behave strangely if I make a syntax error (weird tabs, spacing, etc), which is a decent indicator. However, this doesnt show what the error is. 
 I&#x27;m asking because there&#x27;s like 20 different flymake options in the customization panel.
 I&#x27;ve tried activating flymake-mode, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything when I write bad syntax on purpose for testing.

                              <span>For those who don&#x27;t want to use PowerPoint and Keynote, and those living in Linux world, the best solution to write slideshows is basing on html5.
 There are reveal.js, impress.js and others, but I think Spectacle is the most powerful.
 With this ox-spectacle.el, a spectacle.js backend for org export engine, you can make beautiful and powerful slideshow easily. To me, it&#x27;s one of the best solutions to create slideshows.

Would anyone be able to give me a keyword/solution for this? I very much appreciate your help. Thank you.

 So I am using servant client.
 I am trying to create another endpoint very similar to an already existing endpoint. Say the type was
 type GetMe &#x3D; &quot;me&quot; :&gt; Header&#x27; &#x27;[Required, Strict] &quot;loveYou&quot; String :&gt; QueryParam &quot;endlessly&quot; String :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] You 
 I want to add another header field so my first thought is....
 type GetMe &#x3D; &quot;me&quot; :&gt; Header&#x27; &#x27;[Required, Strict] &quot;loveYou&quot; String :&gt; QueryParam &quot;endlessly&quot; String :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] You type GetMe2 &#x3D; &quot;me&quot; :&gt; Header&#x27; &#x27;[Required, Strict] &quot;loveYou&quot; String :&gt; Header&#x27; &#x27;[Required, Strict] &quot;tooMuch&quot; String :&gt; QueryParam &quot;endlessly&quot; String :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] You type APImy &#x3D; GetMe : GetMe2 getMe :: String -&gt; Maybe String -&gt; ClientM You getMe &#x3D; client (Proxy @ GetMe) getMe2 :: String -&gt; Maybe String -&gt; Maybe String -&gt; Client…</span>

                              <span>For context, I have written complete bindings to five different C libraries (freetype2, libvorbis, libspng, al, Chipmunk2D) and the question in the title may very well be the last one I have concerning FFI for quite some time. The question originates from the fact that chiphunk strips prefixes, something no other low-level library I&#x27;ve seen does.
 Reasons for stripping prefixes:
  
The module structure was made for this. If there was a convention to be made for writing C bindings, this is the obvious default. Kudos for defining new Bool/Int/Float types, it&#x27;s refreshing to remember Prelude is a module like any other one;
 Probably saves a few thousand characters per library, plus makes Haddock easier on the eyes;
  
Reasons to keep prefixes:
  
OpenGLRaw did it first and it still holds the gl prefix, same with gl;
 No need to explicitly qualify imports;
 Names stay at 1:1 to the API reference, if one exists;
  
There obviously is no one true answer to this question, I&#x27;m merely looking for the public opinion on this. I may well leave everything as is since the libraries work well enough regardless of the actual function names.

                              <span>Electrical circuits have static topology, there is restricted dynamism through &quot;switch&quot; which i think is transistors. Do electrical circuits have &quot;join&quot; and if so what is it? You&#x27;d have to spill water on the circuit or have the ability to rewire itself. But the extent to which it can rewire is pre-determined by whatever was printed on the board.
 What is a higher order function or closure in an electrical circuit? It is a &quot;piece of circuit&quot; that can be joined or not, but the ways in which the join can be activated are constrained, so this is not actually join. Circuits are compiled. Do HOFs compile to &quot;piece of circuit&quot; guarded by switches?
 How would one model a concurrent list comprehension (dynamic cardinality) in a circuit? This should be possible with applicative because the continuation is pre-fabbed and reused, though here we need multiple instances of it. Can a circuit do this or do you need to print the continuation C times to the board, thus constraining the list cardinality by amount of &quot;memory&quot; on the board? Is this the essence of applicative – you do not know how much memory you will need?
 Can we encode dynamism into the frequency domain? A single physical circuit on the board, and multiple input signals multiplexed through the circuit simultaneously?

                              <span>Hi community! First post here. I’ve been tinkering w Haskell for many months now and gotta say I love it. It truly is a no going back language after the few thousand initial head bangs against the wall 🤕😅
 The question in the back of my mind is why does a pure inmutable language need garbage collection for (which is an instant disqualify from AAA games an any other real time task I guess and the big selling point of Rust)?
 Variables are scoped to functions and in need of Ref and friends, living inside monads couldn’t they just be destroyed automatically (in a deterministic way) once out of the context?
 I get being lazy has a toll on memory usage, but is that a real limitation nowadays?

Recently I took a course in programming paradigms and was introduced to Haskell and functional programming. I found it very fun and interesting, so I am planning on taking more classes in functional programming in the future. But, other than in research and academia, where is it used? I never see any job postings looking for someone knowing Haskell/functional programming.

                              <span>I just started using emacs again after 10 years :-). I&#x27;m using the basic GNU Emacs distribution for Windows 64. Without having to use a hot-rodded version, I was looking for some info on a few basic customization tips that almost anyone new to emacs would want to do. For example, I figured out how to change fonts, window size and basic foreground/background colors and put those commands into my &quot;init.el&quot; file, so now it looks better (and is more usable for me).
 It would be nice to figure out how to make Emacs use the mouse for basic cut and paste from the clipboard. also, if you are in the command line, it would be great if the up-arrow key would give you command history (is that possible ?). Is there a list somewhere of the top &quot;5&quot; things a new emacs user would want to do to make Emacs more useful/friendly out of the box ? ... and how to do it ?

                              <span>I am using LSP from within Doom Emacs with evil enabled. 
  
Code actions: When there is only one available code action, lsp-execute-code-action automatically executes the action without asking me to confirm first, this is problematic since often I just want to see what code actions are available on a line, without necessarily executing them. What is the workaround for this?
 
The intellisense messages on the right side of the screen are often truncated due to a lack of space on my screen. How can I view the entire message when this is the case? Surely there&#x27;s a better way than just flycheck-list-errors since I have to actually visually search where in the list the error/warning corresponding to my current line is. Add further to this fact the ID columns on that interface is often truncated

 (And tangentially related: why does flycheck-list-errors provide a different error list than consult-lsp-diagnostics? I have an example of this which I can produce upon demand.)
 ​
  
When LSP shows some information about what I&#x27;m typing in the minibuffer, how can I choose to view that information in full? See the image below. You can even see the &quot;1/3&quot; page label. How do I access those pages? If I press ESC so I can press K, pressing ESC gets rid of the message in the minibuffer and then attempting to press K will simply yield LSP :: No content at point.

next-error / flycheck-next-error does not let you navigate to warnings (despite warnings appearing in the flycheck &#x27;error&#x27; list). Is there a command that also lets me navigate to the next/previous warning?
  
​
  
Are there any other LSP usage tips I should know about?

I installed Emacs using the standard installer provided on the GNU mirror; any update would also be installed using the installer as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on integrating nano into my current setup (which is going nicely). Really like the aesthetic (though it still needs some tweaking). Good use of an hour!
 One really weird thing I encountered which I can&#x27;t figure out - I&#x27;m using nano-modeline (not sure if tthat&#x27;s relevant - I am *not* using nano-bindings), but whenever I pull up the date picker to insert a date, in my old system, I would abuse S-RightArrow or S-DownArrow to move quickly through the calendars and Return to pick the date. 
 However when I try this with nano&#x27;s setup, while I get the calendar pop up, a shift Right, Down or Left gets me a [No window right from the selected window] etc type message like it&#x27;s trying to move to another window or buffer rather than move along the datepicker calendar. Strangely, other keys like M-S-Arrow etc seem to work fine.
 Does anyone know what I&#x27;ve done here or have an idea of what I need to do to restore the default date picking behaviour? (my muscle memory and sanity depend on it).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made my Emacs config on Arch(DWM). And that&#x27;s totally works great for me.
 Some Emacs lover showed interest on my config and wish to use. So they gave it a try.But Alas! they didn&#x27;t get anything of my config working on their machine. I&#x27;ve tried to search what cause the problem but couldn&#x27;t find any.
 So it&#x27;d be very helpful If anyone here has time to look into my config and catch the bug for the lover of Emacs like us.
 this is how it showed-up on opening:
 running emacs --debug-init give this output:
 here&#x27;s my config of : GNU Emacs
 Please have a look in it. I hope it&#x27;ll be very easy for you guy&#x27;s :)

                              <span>I am on emacs 29 and the latest commit on the 29 branch. After following the install instructions form https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/ I enabled tree-sitter-hl-mode and the syntax highlighting changed from the default major mode one to the one below. However, this does not look consistent at all. I thought that tree-sitter would put a focus on giving e.g. local variables like v below the same color throughout the entire scope. but this does not seem to be the case. Am I missing sth here? because like this I dont see any merit over the ordinary highlighting

 Can tree-sitter be used to provide some of the lsp functionality.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m having trouble with python mode. Specifically, there&#x27;s a command &#x60;python-check&#x60; which runs a code checker on the current buffer. You can specify which checker to run and by default it&#x27;s &#x60;pyflakes&#x60;.
 Everything works as expected and the code gets checked. However, if I try to use &#x60;flake8&#x60;, the encoding is all messed up (from what I understand) and I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to fix this.
 You can see the code (lsp works as expected and I do get autocomplete, suggestions, documentation, etc with pyright)
 All good here, lsp works as intented
 Now, if I run &#x60;pyflakes&#x60;, here is what I get:
 ​
 This is also good, pyflakes works as expected
 Now I run &#x60;python-check&#x60; (C-c C-v keybinding):
 flake8 instead of pyflakes
 And what I get is this:
 flake8 encoding?
 Which actually works, but my guess is encoding is messed up somewhere and I am not sure where exactly.
 As a side note, running &#x60;flake8&#x60; in vterm works normally:
 vterm
 I also tried &#x60;(set-language-environment)&#x60; to UTF-8, but that didn&#x27;t help.
 Has anyone encountered something like this and resolved it?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I am really struggling to get good performances on windows with emacs...
 As far as I understand, windows sub-process and file system is working against emacs way of doing things. Therefore I&#x27;ve read multiple times that switching to WSL makes emacs much more performant. Also using a VM with Unix might help.
 I&#x27;ve tried that and basically have seen 0 improvement, especially with LSP and maggit. I&#x27;ve built emacs from source to be sure that native comp, etc, is enabled.
 Using only the Linux file system (not using /c/...) made emacs a little better but still far from my Linux experience with it :( my config works really well on Linux, so I don&#x27;t think it is problematic?
 I am using emacs for very different purposes such as: unity c#, c++ dev (sometimes with VS), .Net, org mode, org roam, trump edit, etc... Which makes it hard to live only in the wsl Linux file system as far as I&#x27;ve been able to test (a pain with unity, a pain with VS, a pain with / and \, a pain with crlf and lf, etc...)
 Does anyone have a good way to have a performant emacs on windows please? Does the native window switch on v29 improves anything?
 Emacs is such a good piece of software, it makes me really sad that after battling for months to try to solve the problem, I find myself on the verge to switch editor again because I cannot ditch windows...

It&#x27;s very convenient as it opens a list of available macros, followed by a type of references, followed by a list of labels to insert. On the other hand, cleveref extends cross-referencing, which add very useful macros and does other things as well.
 Currently, my routine is to press C-c ), insert a standard \ref{}, and then change it to \cref{}.
 I tried to find solutions, which implement Cleveref in RefTeX but there is not many sources; the one I found here on TeX does not seem to work; It does not add anything new to the list.
 I found somewhere else this line: (setq reftex-refstyle &quot;\\cref&quot;). This is OK. RefTeX no longer asks for a macro but go straight to a list of types followed by a list of labels. Then it inserts \cref{...} with a proper string.
 This works but ideally though I would have a proper list of macros available from Cleveref: \cref{}, \Cref{}, \namecref{}, \pagecref{} etc. on top of regular macros.
 Does anyone have or know about a working solution?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m new to emacs and I built v28.2 on my Pop! OS Linux instance. I&#x27;m trying to get my init file to work to set the initial window (frame) size.
 I&#x27;ve created an init.el file in my .emacs.d folder in home (i.e., ~/.emacs.d/init.el), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be executed.
 When I start emacs, it looks like this:
 Figure 1. Initial Emacs Window (roughly 900x900)
 What I want is for it to look like this:
 Figure 2. Resized Emacs Window (roughly 2500x1100)
 But it always starts out as Figure 1 and the only way to get it to Figure 2 is if I open my init.el (right-click in Nautilus and select emacs).
 And here is a third view showing my .emacs.d (shown by C-x C-f of ~/.emacs.d), the contents of the init.el file and the value of my user-emacs-directory (which is ~/.emacs.d/):
 Figure 3. .emacs.d folder, init.el file, and user-emacs-directory variable value.
 I&#x27;ve also tried renaming the init.el file as .emacs and putting it my home folder with the same result.
 What am I missing here?
 EDIT: responses based on replies:
  
user-init-file shows &quot;~/.emacs&quot;, which, as noted above, I tried along with .emacs.d/init.el without success
 When normally opening emacs, my/set-initial-frame is not defined. If I open the .emacs file from Nautilus, it opens the frame correctly and my/set-initial-frame is defined. If I rename the .emacs file to &quot;foo&quot; and open that from Nautilus, it doesn&#x27;t set the frame and my/set-initial-frame is not defined.
 No errors in *Messages* buffer
 There is no emacs folder in .config
 initial-frame-alist is always &#x27;nil&#x27; (when it works and when it doesn&#x27;t)
 Not sure if I&#x27;m running emacs server, but server-mode variable is &#x27;nil&#x27;
  
Note the original .emacs content I found here.
 Thanks!

                              <span>The larger my zettelkasten becomes, the more the built-in search of The Archive does not give a good overview of the search results  in any cases. Especially when I search for keywords which occur in a lot of zettels or that are very short (like e.g. &quot;git&quot;) it takes me a while to find the right zettel. Well, compared to Niklas Luhmann it&#x27;s still ligheting fast, but thats another story. ;-)
Searching is something I do a lot while working with my Zettelkasten. As I said before, title search is the feature I miss the most in The Archive.
On the other hand, I asked myself: would a combined search of title and content not even be better?
To check that out, I made a little Python script that I just pusblished on GitHub (for the first time, by the way – quite exiting!). This is the link:
https://github.com/ralfzosel/zk-smart-search
The installation chapter is quite short – probably too short, if you never used Python before. So if you want to check out my script  (which would make me very happy) and if you have any trouble make it run, I am happy to assist.</span>

Keywords
The keywords should be instructive for the type of task. I have started to distinguish whether an audio-visual input is an interview or a lecture. It is completely irrelevant to me at the action level. I sit down at my computer in both cases and take notes as I watch and listen.
For me personally, it doesn&#x27;t even make a difference whether I&#x27;m listening to a podcast or watching a video. I do both on my computer, because I only listen to both at home with access to my computer. I don&#x27;t listen to anything on the side while on the road.
Rather, I differentiate by length when assigning keywords: short (20min) audio-visual inputs, because I build both differently into my workday.
This is how my current note about Things looks like. Do you have any template or regular practices when you make notes about software?</span>

 In older versions of GHC, I can view the type constructor for functions using the command :info:
 ghci&gt;:info (-&gt;) data (-&gt;) a b 
 However in the current version, 9.2.5, I no longer be able to see this type constructor.
 ghci&gt;:info (-&gt;) type (-&gt;) :: * -&gt; * -&gt; * type (-&gt;) &#x3D; FUN &#x27;Many :: * -&gt; * -&gt; * 
 How can I view the type constructor for functions in GHC 9.2.5?
 Thanks.

                              <span>We know that it is possible to create plantuml or mermaidjs diagrams from org-mode by running code through org babel. For example there is ob-mermaid package which will produce diagram picture from org-mode src block.
 Found an open source solution such as diagrams.net which can create several kinds of diagrams without installing/tuning additional software for each kind of diagrams. Run the software paste code of your diagram into the form and get new diagram. But such kind of manual work is not emacs way . It would be cool to have org-babel &#x27;transport&#x27; to it and result back.

                              <span>I waded back into my init.el to get a nicer aesthetic this week, and have been playing with org-modern. 
 Strangely, when I use the following simple block for it:
 elisp (use-package org-modern :straight t :after org ) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook #&#x27;org-modern-mode) (add-hook &#x27;org-agenda-finalize-hook #&#x27;org-modern-agenda) 
 this causes org-super-agenda (which I heart and abuse regularly) to pitch the following error, which I assume has something to do with org-modern overriding org-agenda or cstom commands somehow. 
 shell Error (use-package): org-super-agenda/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-modern-agenda 
 Any ideas as to what may be going on or how to resolve it? (it is definitely the last hook in the org-modern block that causes the issue as when I comment it out, org-super-agenda triggers normally. 
 thanks! Daryl. PS&gt; Lemme know if you need me to paste up the o-s-a block. Though I feel it&#x27;s probably not related to it for some reason.

                              <span>Hi: Long time Emacs user here (no pro, no guru) just a regular user.
 I use Emacs (Spacemacs) as my editor for developing and I could not be happier.
 Started using Org-roam a while and the whole idea works great for me, but tried Obsidian and before I knew, I collected some good (for me) notes. And discovered a few features I would like to replicate but do not know how.
  
A banner with a picture (see picture)
 Colored blockquotes
  
I know I could export it, to html and add some styling but I would like it to be directly on my file w/o exporting.
 Could you give me some advice please?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I believe org-mode has recently deprecated the use of org-font-lock-ensure in favour of font-lock-something. So, suddenly my emacs 29 stopped showing backlinks in org-roam. I&#x27;ve downgraded to emacs 28 and this seems to solve the problem but was just curious as to if there are nay fixes for this (tho weirdly, 28 seems just as smooth as 29 - note I am using homebrew to install emacs 29.0.60). 
 I *believe* this is what caused it googling around and troubleshooting but was curious as to whether anyone had had the same experience and if there was clarity on the path to supporting 29 (cause I often find it&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s safe to upgrade or do a straight-pull &#x3D;] ).

                              <span>Hey! 
 Did you always want to create beautiful terminal apps using your favorite high level programming language? You may be in luck!
 I started a Scala port of the rust library tui-rs, which I intend to grow into an even better Scala library. I just got it to the point where it made sense to publish a first version, so I wanted to share it as soon as possible:
 https://github.com/oyvindberg/tui-scala
 Hope you enjoy it, and reach out if you want to contribute :)

                              <span>My emacs setup on golang (eglot + gopls) works completely fine when I&#x27;m working on just go scripts.
 However, When I trying to learn wasm+go, eglot is output giving me following error:
 main.go 4 error compiler: error while importing syscall/js: build constraints exclude all Go files in /usr/lib/go/src/syscall/js 
 it&#x27;s probably because of not setting environmental variable, right?. The wasm code compiles with $ GOOS&#x3D;js GOARCH&#x3D;wasm go build -o main.wasm. And eglot doesn&#x27;t know about GOOS&#x3D;js and GOARCH&#x3D;wasm yet.

                              <span>I am running GUI Emacs on Arch Linux WSL2 (Vcxsrv X-server). I am noticing a significant slowdown when I full-screen my GUI Emacs. The slowdown is particularly noticeable in input latency. When I type fast, I would have to wait a few seconds for the letters to appear one by one.
 When I shrink down the size of the GUI frame, Emacs becomes very snappy and responsive. I have noticed a positive correlation between Emacs lag and the size of the frame -- this is the weirdest thing I&#x27;ve come across since I started using Emacs years ago. Running no configuration with &#x60;emacs -q&#x60; is the same thing -- significant latency when the frame is big.
 Has anyone been faced with this issue? I am so bewildered by this but can&#x27;t find anything related online. At the moment I&#x27;m using terminal Emacs as the frame-size vs. latency issue does not exist in the terminal.

                              <span>Previously, not so long ago, I posted about how julia is behaving badly as a result of the TERM environmental variable confusion. 
 Now as I was looking to &#x60;cling&#x60;, a c++ interpreter. It is having some funny business too.
 [cling]$ 1 11 (int) 1 [cling]$ 2 22 (int) 2 [cling]$ apple aapappapplappleapple input_line_6:2:2: error: use of undeclared identifier &#x27;apple&#x27; apple ^ [cling]$ 
 The repeated strings right under the input prompt aren&#x27;t suppose to be there, under term and terminal.app it all worked fine (i.e. without the repeated gibberish).
 That makes me wonder if it is possible to start a comint process using term or vterm

                              <span>My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create, review, and edit with abandon. Trust that something surprising or magical will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does &quot;use&quot; mean? I can use a note&#x27;s contents to reignite ideas in me. They can spark new, novel ideas and connections with established knowledge. Some balance between creation, review, and maintenance has to be made in zettelkasting. In that sense, zettelkasting is like dog training. Dog training is hard work, and it is often not fun to train, but the rewards of a well-trained dog show up throughout the day.
Reviewing zettel has been a focus of mine, and I highly recommend it. Looking at notes created yesterday, three weeks ago, six months ago, and last year is a great start. If we develop notes sporadically, we&#x27;ll probably only have one or two notes to review. Slowly and steadily, we plow through our notes, and in time, we will have reviewed every note multiple times.
I think Minto is confused about how much time it takes to review a couple of notes (if atomic, focus on a single idea) and how a short review over and over builds, reinforces knowledge, and shows not only new connections but whole new ideas.
Is it true that the ideas captured in our notes are not worth reviewing? I suggest the next to capture, the review is the most essential piece in a ZK workflow.

                              <span>In Scala 2 we used implicits object pattern:
 import acme.Acme import acme.implicits._ 
 In Scala 3 we are supposed to use import given:
 import acme.{Acme, given} 
 However, import given doesn&#x27;t truly replace the functionality of the pattern:
  
In Scala 2, &quot;extensions&quot; were coded as implicit class, so they were covered by import acme.implicits._
 
In Scala 3 extension is not given. So import given ignores them.
 
 In consequence, the old &quot;implicits object pattern&quot; must be kept alive, for orphaned extensions:
 import acme.{Acme, given} import acme.extensions._ 
 I believe this deficiency may have been overlooked, because non-orphaned (is there a name for it?) extensions don&#x27;t need explicit imports (which is a great feature BTW).
 Proposed solutions:
 1. Make import recognize extensions as givens, just for the sake of it:
 import acme.{Acme, given} // imports extensions too import acme._ // does not import extensions 
 2. Add another type of import: import extension
 import acme.{Acme, given, extension}

 I&#x27;m thinking of learning Scala because I find Java to be very verbose. But my main concern is if I can use it if my teammates are working on a Java project. If I can, does Scala provides a way to interpret Scala code back to java so anyone can read it?

 Zombie movement and attack
 Zombies move forward a space equal to their speed each turn, if they can. If a zombie cannot move forward because there is a plant in the space it is standing on, the zombie bites the plant and reduces its hit points by 1 and remains on that space. The only exception to this is the Vaulting zombie: if its speed is still 2 , then he jumps over the first plant and moves on, but his speed is reduced to 1.
 Let&#x27;s define the performZombieActions function, which will perform the aforementioned appropriate action on all zombies in the model. If a zombie reaches the end of the playing field, return Nothing! The function does not have to delete dead plants!

 Does anyone recall this? I&#x27;m trying to find it. I think it was a youtube video.

                              <span>Raku programming language hashes name, version, author, and other package metadata and uses the hash as the directory name for a library or a program. Even the names of program resource files are hashed before installing resource files.
 Raku didn&#x27;t have to hash, but it did because some file systems don&#x27;t support unicode file names.
 The end result is that it&#x27;s possible for a raku module repository to host a library written by different authors and for raku programs to import different versions of the same library written by different authors. I think this is almost the most advanced module system.
 I think haskell can do the same by differentiating name, version, and author of a library or a program when installing them onto a system. Then, haskell can install and import multiple versions of a library written by different authors. This can mitigate downsides of dynamic linking.
 If hackage hosted a library written by different authors, then no one has to ask hackage maintainers for taking over an unmaintained library or program.

                              <span>I remember from Dan Grossman&#x27;s Programming Languages course in SML that if you changed anything, you&#x27;d have to restart the REPL to make sure you weren&#x27;t shadowing or clashing with stuff. So for example I load this into a ghci REPL
 fracEquiv a b c &#x3D; (a * c) / b 
 and I don&#x27;t want that version anymore, I want my fancier version
 fracEquiv &#x3D; \a b c -&gt; ((a * c) / b) 
 So I guess my new fracEquiv overwrites the old one. Problem solved(?) But what if I just called it fracEquiv2 and wanted to make the REPL forget about the original fracEquiv ? So in general, is there a way to dump/see what the REPL has and then go in and excise -- or even change -- what&#x27;s in the running REPL? Or am I just flying blind and having to remember what&#x27;s in the REPL, overwrite or restart it? So if Haskell doesn&#x27;t allow this, do you know of any REPL-based languages that do?

 Does someone of you know something about it?
 The best thing would be to get the bibliography printed at the end as references and have cites as in the IEEE format, e.g. [1]. But without explicitly writing it in the tex file.

                              <span>Put simply: Zmanim refers to a handful of times throughout the day during which certain rituals are completed. The catch: These times are not consistent from day to day, as they are related to the length of the day and the time of sunrise and sunset. As such, a simple daily timer doesn&#x27;t work. Various online services give times for Zmanim, such as this one (New York for an arbitrary example). 
 I&#x27;m interested in setting up Emacs to give Zmanim times. I don&#x27;t know of any package that does this. Is there such a package, and if not, is there a package that can accept timers with offsets or scrape a specific website to provide that information?

 No matter what, I can&#x27;t access files inside docker... 
 After doing C-x C-f /docker:(Here I put in docker id):/
 But after that, I can access nothing. No matter what path I enter afterwards, it will result in asking me to make-directory, since it doesn&#x27;t exist. Nothing. 
 I tried volumes as well, yet, nothing.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 Some time ago, I commented in the Alchemist Resurrection issue, talking about how alchemist.el can be a nice alternative to LSP. 
 BUT, with the news that in the next Emacs version eglot (lsp client) is going to be in the core, I decide to modify alchemist in a different way, enhancing other capabilities and letting eglot do what he best does (which is the functionality of elixir-ls).
 I&#x27;m quite relief to know that this lsp server is FROM the community and heavily inspired by the original alchemist-server.
 For now, Apprentice is usable, similar to alchemist.el but with most of the merge requests in place and with some changes:
  
Remove s, f and dash dependencies
 Remove cask as a project manager, using a simple Makefile (I don&#x27;t have anything against Cask, but I prefer to use my method)
 No alchemist server, this is the main point and all the functionality that was using some of the underlying capabilities are not working (but some of them will be implemented in a different way)
 An optional vterm REPL with IEx
  
My next steps will be to fix some underlying functionality that was quite useful like help and macroexpand. 
 I hope in the future to submit this fork to MELPA (given that alchemist.el is no longer maintained),for now, here is the project:

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble finding how to copy and paste notes from some windows files I have in OneNote vs emacs.
 My org-mode files are in UTF-8 and I am mid process of moving a lot of info at work from OneNote into emacs to try to consolidate a few years worth of notes in OneNote, Joplin, Logsec, Obsidian...
 Anyway, when the bullet points are copied into Emacs, I get \225 characters that are the code for the windows bullet point and I can&#x27;t save the file without errors into UTF-8 like I do with my other files.
 I saved it as Raw text now to try and use M-x find-file-literally and M-x replace-string but when I type in the code as it looks in emacs, I can&#x27;t replace &#x27;\225&#x27; with a dash &#x27;-&#x27; to convert it to a emacs normal list.
 Am I using the find-file-literally wrong? I can manually change all of the text but I&#x27;ve done that a few times and tried a few things now and I don&#x27;t know what I need to do to replace the \225, \247, type characters that come over from whatever windows type character they are.
 Also, I am on Windows 10, using emacs 28.2 and doom-emacs.
 Attached are screenshots of what it looks like and what buffer output I get trying to convert all this.

                              <span>I was investigating why inferior julia is showing no prompt at all. My investigation leads to me submit this issue: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/47837.
 The solution is to set TERM &#x3D; dumb, however, I have used setenv process-environment to set TERM to dumb, still inside the inferior julia, ENV[&quot;TERM&quot;] is vt50.
 Opening a terminal and type TERM&#x3D;linux julia, this change is reflected inside the process, i.e. ENV[&quot;TERM&quot;] is linux. 
 Is this a case of processes started with comint not respecting TERM environmental variable??
 I am confused about this behaviour.

                              <span>I mostly use emacs-nox (on Linux with KDE Plasma) so the select-enable-clipboard setting does not work like when you are in graphical mode. Reading https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CopyAndPaste most packages deal with reading the system clipboard content and not setting it. I tried simpleclip.el but when running simpleclip-copy I got the error message Clipboar suppot not available.
 I can use emacs in graphical mode, but really prefer emacs-nox, because I mostly live in Konsole. Plus some keyboard shortcuts do not work in graphical mode like C-c down (C-c M-O B) (command-org-shiftdown) which I haven&#x27;t investigated the cause of.

                              <span>My current init.el is shared between 3 computers: my Linux desktop, my main work (intel) macbook with thunderbolt dock + closed lid + 3 attached screens, and my (m1) macbook that I use on the couch etc.
 I switch between Linux and MacOS specific configs with several blocks like this:
 (defun my-system-type-is-darwin () &quot;Return non-nil if system is darwin-based (Mac OS X).&quot; (string-equal system-type &quot;darwin&quot;) ) (when (my-system-type-is-darwin) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;s-/&quot;) &#x27;comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line) ) 
 So I&#x27;ve got the different system types fairly easily distinguished.
 Unfortunately, the font sizes that work OK on the main docked macbook with multiple screens don&#x27;t work well on the undocked/portable macbook.
 Any advice on a robust way to tell which mac I&#x27;m using, with a view to the config working on other screen configurations? I was thinking I could just detect a hard-coded &quot;if 3 screens of these dimensions then do X, if 1 screen of those dimensions do Y&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure the best way to do that, or even if that is the best way to do what I want.
 Any other tips for sharing a single init.el between multiple computers?

 OK, I&#x27;m dumb. I found the answer myself within 30 minutes.
 The culprit was make-symbol, which creates an uninterned symbol which is distinct from regular symbols that are checked using assq. Now I changed make-symbol to intern in rangho/create-color-matrix-alist and everything works fine!
 Original post
 I wanted to try using let-alist to simplify my colorscheme code. Basically, I have an alist of colors and its hex values, and I have a list of HSL percentage points. I want to create a new &quot;matrix&quot; alist where each colors are lightened by the &quot;lighten list&quot;. This is the code:
 ;; Map color values to their representative colors ;; Note: An &#x60;i&#x27; next to color name represents that ;; it is the &quot;intense&quot; variant of the color (defvar rangho/color-name-alist &#x60;((color/fg . ,wal/foregroun…</span>

 I&#x27;m just stepping my feet into emacs world. I have a Windows 10 machine. I have 2 options to install emacs. either install the native windows version of emacs or install ubuntu in WSL and get the linux version of emacs. 
 How to decide which one to use?

                              <span>I have searched online a lot found a lot of ways to filter the list based on one keyword. Ex:-
 (defun my/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tag-name) (lambda (node) (member tag-name (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag (tag-name) (mapcar #&#x27;org-roam-node-file (seq-filter (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag tag-name) (org-roam-node-list)))) 
 But i have not found a way to just remove a single tag or a catagory from the list. I would like to hide the tag of
 #dailies 
 org-roam files from the list as well as the file which have the catagroy of
 @Groups 
 from the list.
 I am aware that you can i can type !@Groups in the search bar to remove these entries but i do not want to type them out every time i open the org roam find node command and i want the default view to not contain these tags/catagory

dependency updates 
 less verbose error messages (now stack trace from the macros is printed only if debugLevel flag is set to non-zero)
 suppressing of warnings for synthetic vars in automatic coloring analysis.

I am a tech writer/editor/indexer, and found the ZK method online while researching new organizing methods (new to me, not to the world).  I was tired of feeling like Butterbur&#x27;s mind--&quot;thing wanted always buried.&quot; My zettelkasten will be more for my own personal pursuits than for work.
I will be here reading, writing notes, and keeping quiet until I have my sea legs. I&#x27;m reading Sonke Ahrens now.
Thank you for this wonderful resource, and for the sharing of knowledge and wisdom I see here.

                              <span>When designing a storage solution for large datasets, the most common families of architectures are data warehouses and data lakes.
A data warehouse is a database management system that houses data from multiple data sources.
Data is structured in a predefined schema, and can be easily analyzed.
A data lake stores all structured, semi-structured and unstructured data in an object storage system.
Unlike a data warehouse, it is not necessary to process data in order to add it to a data lake.
While data lakes are often more flexible in terms of writing data when compared with data warehouses, reading data can be more difficult because it has to be validated against a schema.
This is known as “schema-on-read”.
Now consider the following figure, introduced by Databricks:

                              <span>Since it&#x27;s Advent of Code season, I&#x27;ve been trying my hand at Haskell (again) for solving puzzles, and I&#x27;m also using Stack for building them.
 I organize each day&#x27;s puzzle into standalone executable, say day07_1 for part 1, and day07_2 for part 2. What I notice is that, when I run stack run day07_1 with source changes, Stack installs every binary configured in stack.yaml at that point. 
 Installing executable day03_1 in /path/to/project/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux-tinfo6/dc2a579bc1e31f17298a361ff9411c0bf46198b8cd4c4cdef19391b674e4f1ff/9.2.5/bin 
 Obviously, as I add more and more binaries, this gets increasingly annoying. I&#x27;d prefer that it rebuilds only the binary I asked it to build.
 Does anyone know why Stack does this, and if there&#x27;s a way to tell it not to do so? I don&#x27;t see any relevant options in stack run --help.
 As a workaround, I&#x27;m commenting out binaries in stack.yaml than the very one I&#x27;m working on at a given time, which is not ideal.

 I see this kind of type error from time to time, and often find it difficult to identify the source of the problem. Usually, it&#x27;s a mistake elsewhere that throws things off, but here the only change preserves type. The error messages and alternative instances are not helping me at all. Is there a systematic approach that is helpful for identifying the problem in these cases?

 But, you can settle with something good, useful, and practical.
 Haskell can be as easy as you want or as difficult as the number of complex type-level features you drag into your program. It has many useful libraries.
 It has useful type-level features that are not difficult to understand.
 It is not perfect, but it has been practical in my life. It is not the best langauge for everything. I use multiple languages for multiple purposes, but when I use haskell, it is good.
 Haskell is in a practical state of existence.

                              <span>Just went through this, so I thought I&#x27;d document it for Google. What I wanted was a) for Emacs to open new files in the same frame where possible, and b) for my init.el to actually work in the new frames.
 1. Put .emacs.d in user folder
 It saves a lot of messing around if your .emacs.d is in C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming, but if you&#x27;re like me, you actually keep it on Dropbox or something. So I made a symbolic link that points to it on Dropbox:
  
Start an elevated (admin) cmd prompt
 cd C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming
 mklink /D .emacs.d C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\.emacs.d (for example)
  
2. Make a shortcut to start the Emacs Daemon
  
Make a shortcut to emacs-28.1\bin\emacs.exe
 Add --daemon to the end of the Target (e.g. C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\emacs.exe --daemon)
 I didn&#x27;t change Start In.
 Put this shortcut into your Startup folder (C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) so that a new server starts with Windows.
 Run this now to start the server.
  
3. Make a shortcut to Emacs ClientW
  
Make a shortcut to emacs-28.1\bin\emacsclientw.exe
 Add -n -t -a &quot;&quot; to the end of the Target (e.g. C:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\emacsclientw.exe -n -t -a &quot;&quot;)
 I didn&#x27;t change Start In.
  
The presence of -t lets you run this shortcut to open a new Emacs client frame that starts at *scratch*.
 The absence of -c makes Emacs open files in an existing frame instead of _c_reating a new one. 
 This emacsclientw shortcut is what you point to when you&#x27;re telling Windows what app to use to open text files etc.
 4. Make some changes to init.el
 ;; Set custom font here or else new frames won&#x27;t see it (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Hack-12&quot;)) ;; You may want to have dired start in a specific folder (setq default-directory &quot;C:/Dropbox/&quot;)

 Does a method to &#x27;embed&#x27; Emacs in VSCode already exist yet? Or a bridge that can shuttle text between the two IDE&#x27;s? 
 Extension to Embed Neovim In VSCode
 If not, since Emacs already has a client/server built-in, I wonder how difficult it would be to adapt this scaffolding to use VSCode as a &#x27;client.&#x27;

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a longstanding issue I haven&#x27;t found a solution for. Any time I&#x27;m editing an org mode file my cursor will automatically &quot;suck back&quot; to the last text on the screen. For example, I type a sentence, finish with a period then hit space twice to start the new sentence. If I don&#x27;t type something immediately (like less than a second) the cursor is pulled back to the period, removing the space(s).
 Needless to say it&#x27;s rather annoying behavior. It&#x27;s 100% consistent and what I gave was just an example, it&#x27;s happening in any scenario...using spaces or tabs, happening in lists, etc.
 This is Doom Emacs and I&#x27;m running this in 28.1 on Void Linux but it was there in 27.x as well.
 Let me know if there any more info I can provide and TIA for your help.

                              <span>I have been doing alot of presentations in org mode which I export to beamer. I often need to use the ignoreheading feature to close latex environments but it makes the document very hard to read. Could anyone provide some guidance of how to achive the following result. 
 Thank you!
 Here is an example of how a section of my document looks: 
 * Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) ** Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) *** General Form \[g(\mathbb{E}[Y]) &#x3D; \alpha + f_{1}(X_{1}) + \cdots + f_{p}(X_{p})\] *** :B_ignoreheading: :PROPERTIES: :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading :END: \vfill 
 I would like it to ultimately look something like: 
 * Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) ** Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) *** General Form \[g(\mathbb{E}[Y]) &#x3D; \alpha + f_{1}(X_{1}) + \cdots + f_{p}(X_{p})\] [Ignored Header] --------------------------- \vfill

 I have in my init.el configured the clang-format-buffer call as a hook on the event before-save-hook for c and c++ modes.
 I don&#x27;t understand why the .cmake files are processed too. Any hint? The problem is that the cmake files are parsed (corrupted) by the clang-format tool
 (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook (lamda() ( add-hook &#x27;before-save-hook &#x27;clang-format-buffer()))
 Thanks

                              <span>Whenever I use rgrep and enter eg. umlauts, Emacs creates the following command line:
 find [...] -exec grep --color&#x3D;always -i -nH --null gef\ördert \{\} \;
 Grep returns with no results found. The problem is that the umlaut ö get&#x27;s prepended with an escaping sequence. If I run the same command on the commandline without the backslash, grep succeeds. Why is Emacs escaping certain characters anyhow, especially utf-8 valid characters?
 Using bash as the shell. file encoding is utf-8, I set LC_ALL in .profile to en_US.utf8, LANG&#x3D;C, SHEL&#x3D;/bin/bash. My Windows is German though.

                              <span>I am discovering the wonders of Eshell. I would like to use vterm rather than term for visual commands. (e.g. top etc.) Is there an easy way to configure this?
 Also: is there a way to use completing-read for searching history? I&#x27;d love to use all my nifty Vertico+Orderless config for that.

                              <span>I have a function in a package I am working on that reads a bunch of Org files, extracts metadata and saves that in a list.
 The problem I am facing is that Org mode enables all minor modes (such as LaTeX preview) while reading the file. This makes the function slow. I also need to manually kill these files. I only want their metadata.
 Is there a way to temporarily open a file without activating any modes to just extract data I need and close it? Something like:
 (with-temp-buffer FILE-NAME (CODE))

                              <span>As a newcomer here I just wanted to share my point of view for the community and any maintainers. Emacs has already expanded my mind and I&#x27;m beginning to grok the power of having a Lisp system at my fingertips. Now I can get through the more research-intensive install (on macOS at least) to find the best build and install flags. And I can get through learning and customizing any historical quirks of software going on 50 years strong..
 But one big obstacle to me, which isn&#x27;t customizable, is that the cursor is always in view. Even in the GUI there is this trait which makes it feel like a terminal application (which it did start as). It fundamentally changes how one selects and navigates text (select text, scroll back up and select region disappears). In a world where every other GUI app doesn&#x27;t behave this way, it is a big change. It feels like a constraint. This will force me deeper into keyboard centric navigation which is fine. I just think cursor flexibility should not be overlooked and for younger people who are switching from other editors and have used the mouse their whole lives, I can see it hurting adoption.
 This is probably very hard to implement, going against how it has always worked, but I think that would be good to at least have an option to let cursor scroll off screen. Let me know what you think. Kinda related: does anyone know of a package that makes the select region wrap around words instead of going edge to edge on screen?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at the Emacs 29 typescript-ts-mode.el and see that to leverage tree sitter, the mode is far different than programming modes before -- which isn&#x27;t surprising. What is surprising is that I can&#x27;t find what I&#x27;ll call ruby-ts-mode anywhere.
 I&#x27;m goofy enough to leap off and start my own but thought I&#x27;d poke the bushes a little to see if one already exists.

                              <span>I am aware of the cl-lib library, and it is pretty cool if you want to write elisp code that is pretty close to Common Lisp code. 
 HOWEVER, is there any sort of interop library that would allow one to program IN Common Lisp to extend emacs? I would think such an interop system would allow one to interact with Emacs&#x27; buffer functionality in particular. 
 I&#x27;m not really sure that such a thing is very practical or would interest many people. But I recently wrote a Python interop library that allows me to use Python libraries from within Common Lisp, and I found it really helped my own understanding of Lisp quite a bit. 
 I&#x27;m just wondering if anything like that has been done. So far, my google searches don&#x27;t reveal much.

                              <span>I am using Helm, project mode, and Projectile -- if those would help me on this quest.
 I&#x27;m in a buffer in a directory and I want to find all the files matching a pattern at or below the current directory. What is a simple (or perhaps the simplest) way to get that list?
 What I do now is switch to a terminal (outside of emacs) and using zsh I do print -l **/*-ts-*.el (or whatever pattern I&#x27;m looking for). It seems very likely that there is a simpler way to do this from within Emacs. I&#x27;m open to loading more applications on my laptop if that would help. This need seems to come up with me very often.
 Thank you

 if this is expected, how in the world is this a good idea? :)

                              <span>So Atom has shut down. I could probably still use it, but for permanence I decided to switch to Emacs since I&#x27;m extremely picky with my editors. 
 To be honest, the first time I tried it I was disappointed how hard it was do something simple as save a file, copy/paste and whatnot. However, the &quot;steep learning curve&quot; everyone talks about is just a matter of having a nanosecond of patience. Then speed comes later. What I love about the keybindings is it confines all of my work to the keyboard and the bindings are ergonomic if you also use the right Ctrl and shift keys. My workflow is honestly magnitudes better, being able to jump at lightning speed, completely neglecting arrow keys and the mouse. Also, for the first time ever, I am using all ten fingers to type. 
 The question: I&#x27;ve set up a theme which I like, auto pairing brackets, indent and auto-complete. Curious if there&#x27;s a way to get linting support? i.e. underlining missing semicolons, typos. 
 Also, can I integrate a terminal into emacs as well? So far having the screen split with emacs and terminal (GNOME on Ubuntu) is working fine, but wondering if there&#x27;s an even better way. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>To make it clear, Emacs 27.0.50 has the org mode code block that has full background, e.g. https://imgur.com/iGg0BEV
 While versions later than it, e.g. Emacs 27.1, has org mode code blocks background that looks like ass. e.g. https://imgur.com/a/4jKE6Yz
 Like wtf??
 How do I get the org mode code blocks to be like 27.0.50 in newer Emacs versions?

                              <span>Hi Folks, hope everyone is well!
 I&#x27;ve been searching for some time to see if this is even possible in Org mode. It&#x27;s so simple and hard to describe in searching that I&#x27;ve come up with nothing and it remains something that is keeping me from going all in on Org.
 Is there no way to promote a field of text in Org without a heading marker?
  
In the attached screenshot, I want the text with the arrow (&quot;Promote this text...&quot;) to be promoted out of this double Subtree block to reside at the same level of text as if it were under History.
 &quot;text here&quot; should remain under Subtree.
  
Can this not be done or am I missing something simple?

                              <span>Is it possible to refer to, or link to, a header in another org file? I&#x27;m thinking I may have to read up on org-agenda. 
 I keep a personal journal, and at this point, it&#x27;s almost a thousand small markdown files no larger than 4k - one for (almost) each day. I refer to each one just simply by linking to the .md and then make my journal entry there. 
 On the upside, I can check what I did this day a year, two year, etc ago by doing &quot;ls *-12-06.md&quot;.. but on the other hand, it&#x27;s really inefficient. 
 I was wondering if it would be more efficient to make an org file for each year and then have header lines for each day, plus additional ones for each topic underneath. I&#x27;d like to be able to link from another org file (say a project, or a movie review) and put a date on there and be able to pull up what I was doing that day.
 Any strategies for doing that in org/emacs?

 My current state is: arduino-language-server is starting when I open a .ino file. I can see it running in ps. The modeline shows something like &quot;arduino-ls is starting&quot;, but it just keeps showing that. no lsp functionality is available.
 Who would be able to help me with that? I&#x27;ll create a github repo for collaborative work in a few days...

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried googling to see if there is a function within haskell to check a number to see if it a Double. I had no luck there so now I am trying to make my own. Right now, I have (gotten from StackOverflow):
 isDouble :: Double -&gt; Bool isDouble n &#x3D; if (floor n) &#x3D;&#x3D; (ceiling n) then False else True 
 Now this works majority of the time, the only issue is when a number has &quot;.0&quot; after. If I were to test 2.0, it returns False, despite actually being a Double. I know this is because both the floor and ceiling are 2. Is there any way around this? Or should I be trying a different approach?

As you may recall, my idea is to create an on-ramp to college-level CS at a top-tier school, e.g., CMU, Northeastern, Tufts, Cornell, and not worry so much about a second-tier place that wants to keep things in Java-, or Python-land. This is a wholenuther can of worms today, namely the &quot;class system&quot; that seems to be growing in CS, i.e., the Haves versus the Have-nots vis-a-vis serious CS theory and concepts. So yes, #1 is making a curriculum that would prepare a kid for, e.g., Robert Harper at CMU teaching a lecture hall full of 90th-percentile kids, and not Professor B.

                              <span>Not going to start flooding the sub with chatbot posts, but ChatGPT managed to output a functional program (discounting some empty lists) for grouping and sorting text:
  
 write a haskell program to process text into groups and sort based on the first letter of the line
  
Here is a simple Haskell program that processes text into groups and sorts each group based on the first letter of each line:
 import Data.Char import Data.List -- This function takes a string of text and returns a list of groups, where -- each group is a list of lines that start with the same letter. The groups -- are sorted alphabetically based on the first letter of each line. processText :: String -&gt; [[String]] processText text &#x3D; -- First, we split the text into a list of lines let lines &#x3D; lines text -- Next, we group the lines by their first letter grouped &#x3D; groupBy (\x y -&gt; (toLower . head) x &#x3D;&#x3D; (toLower . head) y) lines -- Finally, we sort the groups alphabetically by their first letter sorted &#x3D; sortBy (\x y -&gt; (toLower . head . head) x  a -&gt; Ordering, not a a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool, and the lines variable name needed changing to not match the function. Once complete, it compiles and functions more or less as expected. I could spot the head would likely give trouble on empty lists (which it did) and that groupBy could produce some strange groupings, but wild to see the skeleton of a decent sort function produced so easily. Like AI art, this could be pretty useful for brainstorming, if the results aren&#x27;t outright useful themselves.

                              <span>I really like the arrow style in Haskell because of the simple reading from left to right and having kind of a pipe.
 Like this example:
 example1 :: [Int] -&gt; Maybe Int example1 &#x3D; reverse &gt;&gt;&gt; findIndex (&#x3D;&#x3D; 5) &gt;&gt;&gt; fmap (* 2) 
 When working with functors, I often have &gt;&gt;&gt; fmap . Is there an operator which combines the two?
 But for monads, I can&#x27;t even do that:
 example2 :: [Int] -&gt; Maybe Int example2 &#x3D; reverse &gt;&gt;&gt; findIndex (&#x3D;&#x3D; 5) &gt;&gt;&gt; possiblyFailing where possiblyFailing x &#x3D; x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; Just . (* 2) 
 I&#x27;m pretty sure that there are idiomatic ways to both of the cases, but I&#x27;m just not able to find them 😅

                              <span>I want to complete this years Advent of Code in Haskell so that I can learn the language and the functional programming paradigm in general. So far I managed to do the first 4 challenges simply by putting them in different directories and using ghci or runhaskell to execute them. As the point of this is learning the language, I don&#x27;t want to use any libraries not included in base, I&#x27;m implementing functions like split or chunks by myself, but including the implementations of these functions in every single challenge solution doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea. I&#x27;m not sure if Cabal would be a good idea because the project would consist of 25 separate solutions and 25 input files and I&#x27;m not sure how would that go. What is the best way to handle this kind of situation?

                              <span>Hello, I was reading an article form the Haskell Wiki on (Let vs. Where)[https://wiki.haskell.org/Let_vs._Where] and the last portion baffled me a little.
  
In the second case, fib&#x27; is redefined for every argument x. The compiler cannot know whether you intended this -- while it increases time complexity it may reduce space complexity. Thus it will not float the definition out from under the binding of x.
 In contrast, in the first function, fib&#x27; can be moved to the top level by the compiler. The where clause hid this structure and made the application to x look like a plain eta expansion, which it is not. 
  
I cannot really understand how the compiler optimized the first definition of the function and not the second, apparently the redefinition of the function has an impact on time complexity.
 I know that a big part of FP optimization comes to know how to dance with the compiler, it&#x27;s patterns and to lay stuff out for it to make &quot;better&quot;. But unlike tail recursion, this trick doesn&#x27;t seem as clear to me.
 I&#x27;d be most grateful for a clarification on how this works for a beginner haskeller, thanks :-).

                              <span>A few days ago, I asked here if ODBC could be configured to let my SQL databases access my orgmode tables directly. And I like the answer I got.
 But then I tried the new chatbot everyone is talking about. Here is what ChatGPT, at https://chat.openai.com/chat , had to say.

 Can a database use ODBC to access emacs orgmode tables?
 ChatGPT
 Yes, it is possible for a database to use ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) to access tables stored in the Emacs org-mode format. ODBC is a standard application programming interface (API) that provides a way for database management systems to access and manipulate data stored in other database management systems. It allows a database to connect to and query data stored in other databases using SQL, regardless of the underlying database management s…</span>

                              <span>To begin with, I’m using Emacs 28.2 and Org 9.6 on Ubuntu MATE 22.04.
 I&#x27;m having a tough time installing non-GNU packages for Org from Melpa using list-packages. Example: I&#x27;ve downloaded org-superstar-20210915.1934. I just can&#x27;t figure out how to make it load and be active for all org-mode buffers on starting Emacs. I usually use use-package for loading/configuring packages I’ve installed, but Org is so huge and complex that I find it easier to Customize.
 I can manually type M-x org-superstar-mode in an Org buffer and the trailing bullets do change from asterisks to UTF-8 bullets, so the package is definitely loaded. The fact that I can still see the initial bullets as asterisks even though org-hide-leading-stars is on, is an issue for another post.
 Steps I’ve taken:

                              <span>Good afternoon folks! I&#x27;m Tracy, from Ontario, Canada.
I&#x27;ve been slowly familiarizing myself with some of the zettel intros, posts, and concepts, while also trying to be realistic and conscious about the way my brain works and what will be a sustainable habit to introduce into my existing notes system. Currently, my notes span across academia, professional work, personal stuff, grocery lists, conceptual ideas, project sketches/outlines, and even video game progress plans.
These notes are captured in Zotero attachments, paper bullet journals, google docs, iOS Notes App, liquidtext pdf editor, the reminders app... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to so cleanly bundle everything into one tool, but I like the idea of taking the things that really engage and interest me and giving them their own space in the archive so I can make cross-disciplinary connections or revelations!
I am afflicted with the &quot;it needs to be perfect&quot; to start with, and something I&#x27;ve been working on is just doing something &quot;poorly&quot; or &quot;haphazardly&quot; to get that attitude out of the way. My first zettel in the archive software was just me testing the archive syntax (which is new to me) and reflecting on how it feels with my style of note-taking.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more about zettelkasten, knowledge practices, my own brain processes, and the challenge of sorting, retaining, releasing, and integrating knowledge in a way that is helpful to my own goals</span>

 That is because the programming paradigm in itself is fun, but mostly because, in my opinion, the companies investing in Scala have a more &quot;tech friendly&quot; mindset and have actually interesting problems to solve.
 So I am trying to gather ideas and come up with a short list of european companies that would be interesting to target for my job search.
 Any one comes to mind?

                              <span>Is there a lightweight background job runner framework in Scala? Something that&#x27;s backed by a database so the jobs are durable and distributed? I found jobrunr which seems like a great framework, but it&#x27;s Java and doesn&#x27;t have an async API (i.e. each job is assumed to be blocking and runs on its own thread).

                              <span>Hello,
 I have just moved to a macbook and I am already enjoying emacs even more than under WSL. But unfortunately, now the tab key sometimes stops working for emacs GUI. It is not even registered as a keypress: &#x27;C-h c &#x27; just ignores the  keypress. C-i is recognized as a tab press, and in the terminal things seem to work normally.
 I am on Monterey 12.5, emacsplus@28, using a doom config. I tried to find help online but so far was unsuccessful. I have disabled mission control key bindings, including the use of tab to shift focus, but it still seems to happen. Did somebody solve a similar problem? Does it have to do with the shell from which the emacs GUI is started? It might also be something basic about macOs, with which I am completely inexperienced. Thank you for any ideas how to find out what is happening.

                              <span>Super-newbie alert. 
 Hey, I&#x27;m working on a watched movie list for myself (prepping for 2023). One of my hobbies is watching movies (I watch maybe 100-200+ a year - yes that&#x27;s 2 movies a week, sometimes more! I don&#x27;t have cable and don&#x27;t watch much TV outside those times) and I like to track what I&#x27;ve already watched. I had one set-up in Obsidian, but one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the lack of portability (Dataview can only be read within Obsidian). So , I was wondering if I could replicate this in Emacs Org-mode. 
 Here&#x27;s an example - 1st is from Obsidian, 2nd is from Emacs. 
 Is there a way to have it automatically wrap at a certain width? 
 I&#x27;m aware of M-RET M-RET, but I&#x27;d like a more automatic way of doing this, so I can see about typing in my comments a little quicker. For example:
 | IMDB | [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13533944][tt13533944]] | | Watched | 2022-11-19 | | Genre | Horror | | Comment | It was okay. It&#x27;s a &quot;folk horror&quot; and it does pretty well for that. I did enjoy the different &quot;scenery&quot; since the movie was filmed in | | | Ireland. | | Released | 10 Nov 2022 | | | | 
 Also, is it possible to render an image inside a table cell or column? 
 And finally, I was thinking of attaching a movie cover to each &quot;movie&quot; header but then, how do I reference the attachment into an inline image?

                              <span>This may not be the most recent news, but I just noticed from looking at the github issues section of EXWM. 
 From version 0.27 alpha-background can be applied without issues (before there were problems with the system tray).
 To fix system tray issues:
 (setq exwm-systemtray-background-color &#x27;workspace-background)
 Now the future seems to finally have proper gaps:

                              <span>I&#x27;m using lsp-mode for Ruby and Solargraph is my LSP server. Currently, lsp-mode is doing solargraph stdio to make the connection.
 I&#x27;m using Docker containers with Docker Compose. It would be an advantage to me if lsp-mode connected to Solargraph via a socket. Then I could start a Solargraph service listening on a socket in the Docker compose file. Solargraph has this capability but I can&#x27;t find where / if lsp-mode can use this method or not.

                              <span>In Swift, when an RGB value is provided, xcode will render the actual colour of the RGB value on the side. 
 Would this be possible to be implemented in tree sitter? Currently at work, we have a key-value mapping of an enum integers (eg Inventory(69420) to object names (Eg &quot;Iphone 15 SuperPro&quot;). I&#x27;m hoping to render the object name as a comment on the side (similiar to how git-lens work).
 ​
 Would anyone be able to provide a pointer on how I should go about doing this?

                              <span>Or something like that. Maybe it didn&#x27;t include transient, but it did feature quite a novel idea of running frequently used shell commands with varying parameters. If you don&#x27;t remember it but have a similar workflow yourself, please share it! I&#x27;m trying to get inspired :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to configure evil to use the same keybindings as this init.vim.
 I&#x27;m currently having two issues. First C-x C-d (originally dw) is deleting an entire paragraph. Minimal config required to reproduce:
 (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1) (define-key evil-normal-state-map &quot;\C-d&quot; &#x27;evil-forward-word-begin) (define-key evil-normal-state-map &quot;d&quot; &#x27;evil-forward-char) (define-key evil-normal-state-map &quot;\C-x&quot; &#x27;evil-delete)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 Secondly indents don&#x27;t behave as expected
 ;; Indents (setq backward-delete-char-untabify-method &#x27;hungry) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;(lambda () (interactive) (evil-shift-right 0 0) (evil-shift-right 0 0))) (define-key evil-motion-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;(lambda () (interactive) (evil-shift-right 0 0) (evil-shift-right 0 0))) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;(lambda () (interactive) (evil-shift-left 0 0) (evil-shift-left 0 0))) (define-key evil-motion-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;(lambda () (interactive) (evil-shift-left 0 0) (evil-shift-left 0 0))) (setq-default evil-shift-width tab-width) (setq backward-delete-char-untabify-method &#x27;hungry) 
 It worked for a while, but not I can only indent and not de-indent.
 Entire config

                              <span>Ever since installing org-roam I am told to install the elpa version of org. 
 My archives look like this:
 (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;))) 
 And I pinned the version to gnu in use-package
 (use-package org :pin gnu) 
 When I install the org from the package list I get the same error over and over again:
 Error: Invalid function: org-assert-version 
 I have no clue what is going wrong here. 
 thanks for reading.

                              <span>I’ve been tinkering with lisps of some form since I had to learn racket a few years back in uni and have felt stuck at the point of just starting to feel comfortable with the language(s). I’ll do some advent of code problems in a lisp and things seem to go well but as soon as I get stuck it feels impossible to find a solution that makes any sense. In terms of elisp I’ll write simple functions but when digging into plug-in source code feel like there is no amount of study that could make me competent in the language. Is this just the start of the valley of imposter syndrome where you know enough to know what you’re ignorant about or the inability to make the paradigm shift to thinking in a “lispy / function” way? Not meaning to rant just curious how people broke through this barrier if anyone has felt the same.

 A very simple interface brining MilesMcBain&#x27;s breakerofchains R package to Emacs. 
 Very briefly, this package allows you to break long R pipes (chains) and work with the intermediate output. Great for debugging. See MilesMcBain&#x27;s readme for an example. See ess-breakerofchains readme for the single function interface. 
 ​
 As always, feedback welcome. This works for me, no guarantees for others. That said, if there is something I can do to make this more useful to others I am all ears.

                              <span>I saw a demo over at EmacsConf that is related to tree-sitter and the presenter showed a helm chart file and showed fancy-narrow with it.
 If there is one format that I often use, it&#x27;s helm chart files and they can be quite frustrating to edit; the error messages can be somewhat obscure at times, too, so any help I could get from Emacs would be fantastic. Even getting the indentation right can be really troublesome. I&#x27;m not sure if there is a good way to have Helm&#x27;s extra syntax be handled better than yaml-mode seems to do.
 I installed the emacs-plus@29 on a Mac, and it seems to have some tree-sitter support in core, but it seems yaml support might not be there? Anyone else have tips on build(s) to use that might have this in there? From some of the activity it seemed it might be in the works; maybe nightly builds are needed to pick this up?

                              <span>I was watching this video from Cal Newport&#x27;s podcast where he briefly mentions Zettelkasten. The video is about how he uses a simple marking system while reading and how it makes note taking unnecessary for a professional writer. His definition of the Zettelkasten method is something like take notes on everything you read, regardless if it is relevant to your current project. As an example he gives Ryan Holiday. We know that is a poor definition of a Zettelkasten and Ryan is not a good example either. He takes copious notes, but there is no linking in his system. While I don&#x27;t agree with his characterization of the Zettelkasten, I think it is true that some people use it that way.
Anyway, my point is not to complain about his characterization of the Zettelkasten, he mentioned another thing…</span>

                              <span>Hi People!
I&#x27;m an geosciences investigator based in Santiago, Chile.
I found about Zettelkasten a few weeks ago while navigating Wikipedia on Systems Theory -&gt; Niklas Luhman.
It was nice to know about it and got me really excited about the possibilities.
I try to apply systemic thinking on my research, complex systems and stuff, which is really interesting for me but also gave me an (pretty bad) information overload a few years ago. Complex systems theory allows you to see links between disciplines, which also can make hard to focus on one thing at a time.
I struggled through my endless master thesis process. It got me sick for real. Concentrating was sometimes impossible even for whole weeks. Gracefully I ended it well a few months ago and now I&#x27;m a researcher, in the meantime I prepare myself for doing my phd (hopefully 2024 in Berlin).
With renovated energies, I&#x27;m gradually managing to find a new flow for my work and personal life. A really important part is to develop a workflow, combining project management, journaling, synchronization/backing between home and work devices, code software integration.
I use to take notes by hand in a notebook. I have several of them filled with research logs, scientific articles notes, theory notes, ideas, day/week journals. I tried (space)emacs and org-mode a couple of years ago, learned the basics to left it completely a month later.
Now I decided to base my workflow on digital notes. I&#x27;ve sneak into doom emacs with org-roam, obsidian and vscode with dendron.
I&#x27;m inclining in favor of having a note-taking workflow integrated with vscode instead of emacs, as I program in vscode.
Since deciding on digital note-taking systems choice paradox led to paralysis analysis. But today I finally started with a weakly planner on markdown, in any case it will be not worse than writing it on a physical notebook that will be forgotten.
Thanks for maintaining this nice community.
All the best

learning #memory
It is not clear how to operationalize memory [[202211150901]] and thus how exactly to best use how memory works.
Clearly, there are good and bad methods of learning. For an exam, merely repeating the material is inferior to active questioning. Repetition trains recall, while active questioning trains the very behavior of being able to give answers to questions that is required in exams.
Perhaps this results in a hierarchy of learning methods?
Thesis: You should start with simple memory techniques and then work your way up to more complex ones.
Repetition
Active retrieval
Comprehension
Comment: This was part of the last note.
Thanks to the feedback, I have separated the two knowledge modules:

 Is HLS not a worthy enough fulfillment for it to be given the &quot;recommended&quot; status?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing around with lenses to ease the pain of working with records. Imagine the following scenario:
 data Dog &#x3D; MkDog {dogName :: String, age :: Int} deriving (Show, Generic) data Cat &#x3D; MkCat {catName :: String, age :: Int} deriving (Show, Generic) data Pet &#x3D; Dog Dog | Cat Cat deriving (Show, Generic) 
 We have two different types (Dog, and Cat) which share some common structure (here, age). These types, in turn, are the only possible types for a more &quot;general&quot; type, for which we define a sum type (Pet) which holds values of these types.
 This is usually modeled through inheritance in languages like Java and C#, but since Haskell does not support it we use composition instead: we place the shared structure inside our types (here, only an Int is shared between the types, but imag…</span>

                              <span>This is my research so far for database libraries I want to use with SQLite.
  
Serialization/deserialization over raw SQL queries 
 sqlite-simple
 
 Query builders 
 Persistent + Esqueleto // Get used to template haskell.
 Beam // This doesn&#x27;t use template haskell. This has the most SQL features, but can also be more verbose and seemingly more complex than other options.
 Selda // This looks simpler than beam.
 
  
Should database(data &amp; schema) migration be included from the beginning? Or, can it be bolted onto my application later?
 Which ones are going to be the best for a relatively simple SQLite application in the long term? I&#x27;m going to need basic JOINs and basic CRUD operations with probably less than 20 tables. I want to minimize maintenance in the long term like 30 ~ 50 years. Churning is not desirable. I want to write it once and not have to worry about replacing a database library later for as long as I use my application while I&#x27;m alive. Most open-source projects are maintained by less than 3 people, so I can&#x27;t expect other people to keep up with library churning.
 For terminal UI, I chose brick because brick seems good and extremely well maintained although it&#x27;s mostly a one-man show. It seems brick may outlast the usefulness of my application. The man behind brick must be a vigorous guy who grew up with proper nutrition because I have never seen a better maintained open-source project.

 I also put up an issue in core-libraries-committee to provide a focus point for discussion. Would appreciate any comments in that thread: https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/108

                              <span>So I am trying to do more document creation and journaling using org-mode to get more used to it.
 Something I&#x27;m trying to do is have a main header with some sub text then some additional text after the subheadings but it pushes the text under sub heading 2. Is this just how the document structure works and I should work around that or is there some way to format that I&#x27;m unaware of?

                              <span>I would like to keep notes about using Ruby in an .org file. When it comes to simple repetitions working well in Ruby&#x27;s irb, e.g.
  irb(main):038:1* 3.times do irb(main):039:1* puts &quot;greetings&quot; irb(main):040:0&gt; end greetings greetings greetings &#x3D;&gt; 3 
 my assumption was I simply could use a fenced snippet of code such as
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; #+begin_src ruby :results code :exports both 3.times do puts &quot;greetings&quot; end #+end_src
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_src ruby 3 #+end_src &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 however instead of the anticipated greetings, it is the return value 3 which shows up. By my configuration file, babel is aware about ruby, and C-c &#x27; opens the box; there equally is syntax highlighting. Is there an additional parameter to be adjusted to get greetings shown thrice as in the irb?

 edit: sorry, I think I should add that I&#x27;m using spacemacs and the config was added to my user-config section
 Every time I start emacs up, it recompiles the EmacSQL SQLite binary- it takes 20s every time, and it started doing that as I started to setup Org-roam. 
 Why? And can I improve this? 
 Relevant config:
  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/Notes/org-roam/&quot;)) :bind ((&quot;C-c n l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c n f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c n g&quot; . org-roam-graph) (&quot;C-c n i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert) (&quot;C-c n c&quot; . org-roam-capture) ;; Dailies (&quot;C-c n j&quot; . org-roam-dailies-capture-today)) :config (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) ) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook #&#x27;toggle-word-wrap) 
 edit: I&#x27;ve commented out the relevant config for now - it starts up in 1.5s which seems more reasonable.

                              <span>I just started using --with-native-compilation and I was getting this error (see title).
 First, native compilation comes in two modes: synchronous and asynchronous. I was getting the error when the file was being compiled asynchronously.
 It turns out that I&#x27;m using leaf where leaf is a macro. Asynchronous starts fresh and so it doesn&#x27;t know that leaf is a macro and gets confused. So the remedy is to (eval-when-compile (require &#x27;leaf)) at the top of the file.
 TL; DR -- the error above (with a file path and nothing after the proper-list-p is most likely an undefined macro hit during asynchronous compilation.

                              <span>Heya!
 Few days ago in an earlier thread I asked about any existing package for working with age encrypted files. Few folks pointed me in the right direction so I started working on this at https://codeberg.org/sochotnicky/age-mode
 The package is... experimental. There are a few known bugs (and many unknown I am sure). But things work in happy-path scenarios when you have correct identities defined and whatnot.
 I mostly copied over things from EPA package and adjusted for GPG-&gt;age differences (fortunately age is much simpler to work with). So when things are set up right you can get transparent age file decryption on file open and encryption on save. There&#x27;s a few other accessory functions as well.
 Package needs some refactoring, more documentation, better error handling, support for different ways to specify recipients/identities, figuring out why editing over TRAMP saves unencrypted files and more. If someone feels like helping out I&#x27;d be happy to accept patches :-)
 I haven&#x27;t really done that much elisp coding, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed the process so far. I am mostly just scratching my own itch here but who knows, it might help someone else...

                              <span>I wanted to ask experienced emacs users on macos what their distro of choice is in late 2022. As a vimmer interested in emacs due to the vast customization capabilities and especially org-mode, I looked into trying it out for myself. It seemed as though the easiest way to get an idea of the potential of emacs was to install doom. I used the official guides on the repo and tried out both emacs-mac and emacs-plus with native comp. On my M1 macbook pro I experienced major cursor lag (when navigating through text files using vim bindings), they were so severe especially after coming from vim that i ended up removing doom entirely. Vanilla emacs didnt feel a 100% smooth either. Whats even weirder is that weeks after uninstalling emacs itself my computer still had a process running called emacs with 99% cpu useage and high gpu useage. After doing some digging, it seems that there are rendering issues on retina displays specifically that really mess up the responsiveness of the app. I read about different things to try such as using fira code as the font, changing the line highlighting behavior etc.
 ​
 Anyways, Before trying to fix something that seemed broken I want to try to install another build again, and I&#x27;d also be comfortable with vanilla emacs and configuring it on my own if it means stable performance. So what I want to know specifically is the following:
 In your opinion what are reliable distros and build options out of the following distros for M1 on a retina display in terms of responsiveness and light cpu/gpu useage?
 - emacs-mac
 - emacs-plus
 - emacsformacosx
 and would you ppl suggest with native comp or without?

I tried setting it up with use-package but that does not work. If I do the following I get no highlighting (where I expected I should, but maybe not?):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; emacs -Q ; to open emacs with no configs M-x find-file ; open some .cpp or .py file with example code

 M-x font-lock-mode ; to deactivate font-lock highlighting M-x tree-sitter-mode M-x tree-sitter-hl-mode &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And nothing happens. Not sure if what I&#x27;m missing here.

                              <span>Am on Ubuntu 20.04. I wish to upgrade both Emacs and Org-mode. Emacs was installed using Ubuntu&#x27;s Software gui. Org came with that Emacs installation. 
 I&#x27;m guessing the process would be; use Ubuntu Software to uninstall current Emacs, (perhaps delete the elpa Org directory and contents), then reinstall Emacs either using Ubuntu Software, or by sudo apt install.
 Any thoughts or recommendations much appreciated.

                              <span>Tweaking emacs with satisfication is not easy, but I am trying to think how it would work efficiently. The problem of the naive emacs keybindings is that it over relies on the ctrl key, default layout of modern computer keyboard makes it effort-some to do navigation. In my opinion, the alt (or meta) key should be paid more attention as we can balance between those two kinds.
 The first thing I found is that using arrow keys to navigate is fine, but not efficient, as its up and down arrow is not so coherent, and most of times we need rely on the thumb to hit the keys separately. While ctrl-n and ctrl-p can be an alternative to move around between lines, the same as alt-n and alt-p, for which I would suggest that using it as forward-paragraph and backward-paragraph. It can be smoother as oppose to the ctrl- and ctrl-, in the mean time, you can utilize the other combinations such as alt-f, alt-b to move forward word or backward. In that sense, alt key becomes a bold version of ctrl key, since it jumps fast and corresponds to every navigation key that ctrl has. We can therefore switch between those two modifier keys to move in a small pace or in a larger pace without intervening the arrow keys. At the same time, we can assign more combinations to the prefix key alt-s corresponding the ctrl-x. If we can stay mostly at the left region, the keystroke would be more efficient. If we can utilize those two kinds to the best, we can balance the left and right region, such as buffer navigation uses right hand-side alt-[ and alt-], and buffer switch uses alt-\.
 I also want to listen to your suggestions, as I believe everyone has their own opinions and configurations to make a balance, not be overloaded, while be efficient.
 Edit: I have remapped caps to ctrl.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tinkered with Haskell for my own hobbies for a while, but I don&#x27;t use it professionally. (I can&#x27;t use it at my current job, and I&#x27;m not currently in a position to switch jobs, so I&#x27;m not looking to launch a career right this minute. Maybe someday!) It could still be nice to attend something like a conference to learn some new skills and meet people.
 Does anyone know of conferences about Haskell or functional programming that are accessible for amateurs like me? Are you an amateur who has attended a conference? I&#x27;m curious to hear your thoughts and experiences. Personally, I&#x27;m most interested in looking into opportunities in the continental US, but feel free to reply about things happening elsewhere in the world too, in case other readers find it helpful.

From the hoogle page, I understand that two packages have the function (split and extra). Is that correct? I added extra to my .cabal file as a dependency and tried to install the dependencies with 
 cabal install --only-dependencies 
 I tried to run 
 ghci 
 and also 
 cabal repl 
 but I couldn&#x27;t find 
 wordsBy 
 in any of the repls. My vscode is also unable to find it for linting purposes. What should I do?

 I want to convert this text which loaded from postgres db (using json_agg)  &quot;[ {\&quot;msg\&quot;:\&quot;msg1\&quot;,\&quot;email\&quot;:\&quot;qa.x@sample.com\&quot;,\&quot;role\&quot;:\&quot;role-1\&quot;,\&quot;timeAt\&quot;:\&quot;2022-12-01T06:40:14.935Z\&quot;}, {\&quot;msg\&quot;:\&quot;msg2\&quot;,\&quot;email\&quot;:\&quot;sample.mail.com\&quot;,\&quot;role\&quot;:\&quot;role-2\&quot;,\&quot;timeAt\&quot;:\&quot;2022-11-30T21:47:23.229Z\&quot;}, {\&quot;msg\&quot;:\&quot;msg3\&quot;,\&quot;email\&quot;:\&quot;mail3@sample.com\&quot;,\&quot;role\&quot;:\&quot;role-3\&quot;,\&quot;timeAt\&quot;:\&quot;2022-11-30T20:06:25.647Z\&quot;} ]&quot;  I want the output should be list of Message as bellow:
  [ Message {msg: &quot;msg1&quot;, ...} Message {msg: &quot;msg2&quot;, ...} Message {msg: &quot;msg3&quot;, ...} ] 
 Bellow is what i can do so far. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell newtype Messages &#x3D; { messages :: [Message] } deriving Show
 data Message &#x3D; Message { msg :: String, email :: String, role :: String, timeAt :: String } deriving Show
 instance FromJSON Message where parseJSON (Object v) &#x3D; Message  v .: &quot;msg&quot;  v.: &quot;email&quot;  v.: &quot;role&quot;  v.: &quot;timeAt&quot; parseJSON _ &#x3D; mzero
 instance FromJSON Messages where parseJSON (Array arr) &#x3D; _todo &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Thank you!

                              <span>Haskell FFI does not support directly passing structs in function definitions, but there is a way around it:
 Say foo and baz are structs. Given a function with signature
 bar fun1 (foo a, int b); 
 We can define a conversion that uses pointers instead:
 void wrapper (foo *a, int b, bar *out) { out* &#x3D; (*a, b); } 
 Now say we have a different function defined as
 typedef bar (*cb) (foo a, int b); void fun2 (cb callback); 
 cb here can&#x27;t be marshalled, just like fun1 in the first example, but now we need to wrap in the opposite direction: whatever C function we create has to input typedef bar* (*wrapped) (foo* a, int b) and output cb. This appears to be quite a non-trivial task within C. Is there a simpler solution to this I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>When I write a tiny function, I find reading its pointfree representation a good learning exercise.
 Thanks to the ghc wasm port from tweag, I ported https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pointfree to webassembly. 
 You can try it at https://pointfree.pages.dev. It&#x27;s a bit slow and the happy paths are much faster than when the syntax has an error. Feedback welcome.
 Due credits to the authors of https://pointfree.io for the inspiration, the authors of pointfree on hackage and tweag. You guys rock!

 I’ve got a project that I plan to do in the distant future. It involves redefining the IO monad.
 My question is, how much of the IO monad is programmed into the compiler/rts? Or would it simply be writing a new base/prelude? Any pointers would be helpful.

 Later I figured out that haskell community uses formatting with leading commas quite frequently, so I think haskellers will find it entertaining: https://arogozhnikov.github.io/2022/11/29/delimiter-comes-first.html

                              <span>For me, orgmode was the cause to start to get familiar with Emacs. Though using all ten fingers to touch type, I notice the frequent use of the (left) control key to initiate/complete command chords strains my pinky; perhaps especially on a Thinkpad where the position of function key and Ctr are switched.
 While there are instructions how to remap C to an other key accessible with less crawl of the hand, I wonder: was remapping the function of the control key to an other key (e.g., caps lock) a technique frequently used prior to the advent of orgmode?

 Did I miss any easier ways? Has anyone gone down this path before me?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been maintaining the official Haskell docker images for about 2 years now. I have tried to push the project forward in various ways and I’m pleased with where they are now.
 There is more work to be done, such as Alpine and Windows support (both almost done, but blocked on GHC issues or need a final push).
 Unfortunately, I don’t have much time anymore for anything other than basic maintenance. Most of my time is taken up by my day job and my 8 month old. I also no longer work in Haskell, which lowers my motivation. I’d like to hand off maintenance, ideally to multiple new maintainers.
 Is anyone interested? If so, you can post here or on this github issue.

                              <span>Fourmolu is an opinionated, yet configurable formatter for Haskell code. The biggest feature in this release is support for GHC 9.4. So if you&#x27;re using Fourmolu and want to upgrade to GHC 9.4, wait no more! Also includes some quality of life improvements like not considering the leading space in a -- comment as part of the comment, and allowing multiline docs to be styled differently for modules than for functions.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m brand new to Haskell, diving in for the first time using advent of code as an excuse to try and learn the language. I&#x27;m trying to go out of my way to &quot;play&quot;, to get a better sense of how the language works. I don&#x27;t think the specific problem is important in this case, but I have run into some counter-intuitive behavior. 
 My code reads inputs from a file, then does some simple computation (parse String -&gt; Tuple, then &quot;score&quot; that tuple which is just Tuple -&gt; Integer). Then I want to sum the scores. I first did this with a sum and a map, but then realized I could do it in a single fold. Code like this:
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do contents &lt;- readFile &quot;input02t&quot; let input &#x3D; lines contents -- This takes ~2 seconds to run print $ sum $ map (score . readEntry) input -- Same answer, but this takes ~10 seconds to run print $ foldr ((+) . score . readEntry) 0 input 
 The time difference shocked me, because I expected equivalence. Is there a reason the fold takes so much longer than sum + map?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere, but I can&#x27;t seems to find any documentation on how to setup tree-sitter (the official one integrated in emacs 29). I know it is new and documentation might be missing for now. 
 I&#x27;m on mac and using these builds https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds and C-h v and system-configuration-features outputs this
 system-configuration-features is a variable defined in ‘C source code’. Its value is &quot;ACL DBUS GIF GLIB GMP GNUTLS JPEG JSON LCMS2 LIBXML2 MODULES NATIVE_COMP NOTIFY KQUEUE NS PDUMPER PNG RSVG SQLITE3 THREADS TIFF TOOLKIT_SCROLL_BARS TREE_SITTER WEBP XIM XWIDGETS ZLIB&quot; 
 So, it is compiled with tree-sitter. When I activate any major mode like js-ts-mode or tsx-ts-mode I get
 ⛔ Warning (treesit): Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language definition for javascript is unavailable (not-found): (libtree- sitter-javascript.so libtree-sitter-javascript.dylib) No such file or directory 
 How do I find languages definition and install them and make them available to emacs official tree-sitter?

 When I use a virtualenv, it seems that Eglot does not pick it up, which means that I don&#x27;t get completion and type warning for the packages I installed. Is there an easy fix for that?

                              <span>When I use consult-line in a buffer containing only &#x27;some text&#x27; and search for &#x27;text&#x27; it finds no matching lines, but when I search for &#x27; text&#x27; it does find the line. In neither case will it find a line containing only &#x27;(text)&#x27;.
 consult-multi-line (like swiper) finds both lines in both cases. Is there a way to change consult-line&#x27;s behaviour so that it matches that of consult-multi-line and swiper ?

                              <span>Well, expert fellas, I do write my blogs inside this beloved editor (Nope , I am not a fanboy) . I am not yet able to discover or find a way to upload images/videos along with my blog to WordPress(which is what,I do use it for) . 
 Now, what do I have in the dot emacs file? Here is the snippet, which kicks in while emacs initialize...FYI 
 (setq org2blog/wp-image-upload t)
 ..and it is not helping the cause. Most of my recent ( year or so) have written with it and none of them contain any media file. If those have, then I must go to the website and upload it manually. This is exactly what I want to bypass. 
 ​
 Am I missing the obvious?? Oh, what did I do to get it along with the text? This is the exact step I follow, on the blog body ....
 [[ file ~/some_arbitrary_image_file_name]] 
 I am sure, emacs told me something when it failed to upload the image along with blogs and I can&#x27;t get it from the top of my head right now.
 PS: I can embed video url with no problem whatsoever and it works bloody well. 
 ​
 ..and those of you inclined to help me, I might point you to my frivolous dot emacs file, you might glean on it ,if it has some violation of the specific part . 
 Here it is for your perusal: Dot emacs file for your information 
 ​
 Let me know if it is darn obfuscating to describe. TIA

                              <span>After experiencing how unholistic it feels configuring and extending VS Code, I started doing my research. I&#x27;ve tried Vim and Neovim more which has a fractured community. I question Vim&#x27;s perceived efficiency with its keybindings and modal workflow but know it is universally available and quick to load.
 Testing Emacs for the first time opened my eyes and challenged what I thought I ever knew about it. The wealth of its built-in package manager with repos and extensibility is incredible. I thought it was all terminal focused but found out about the GUI and that a large majority of the community is using it. Now I am comfortable in the terminal but far from elite and have never tried a full terminal workflow. I&#x27;d like to hear from professional programmers and admins. What is your preferred choice?
 I want to know and grok the possibilities of using an editor inside a terminal, do you have more functionality, are you able to pipe things easier, etc. I know the benefits of the GUI in graphics and keybindings but is there feature loss or pain points when using something like vterm. Emacs is very flexible and there is many, many ways to complete work.
 In your opinion, should a person that wants to be the best programmer and admin possible focus on using GUI or Terminal Emacs? Thanks a million.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bit at a loss. I&#x27;m not that great with lisp and have been going through documentation for hours now.
 I saw that use-package supports directly customizing fonts through :custom-face which i would like to use to change some centaur tabs fonts. Before i did this &quot;manually&quot; with set-face-attribute. So far, i&#x27;m not getting errors, but my font also isn&#x27;t getting applied. Additionally it seems things like :weight don&#x27;t work here. So, could someone explain to me how this is done correctly?
 My current setup:
 (defvar PropFont) (setq PropFont &quot;Inter&quot;) (use-package centaur-tabs :demand :straight t :init (centaur-tabs-mode t) :bind (&quot;C-
&quot; . centaur-tabs-backward) (&quot;C-&quot; . centaur-tabs-forward) :config (setq centaur-tabs-set-icons t) :custom (set-face-attribute &#x27;centaur-tabs-selected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight &#x27;bold :slant &#x27;italic) (set-face-attribute &#x27;centaur-tabs-unselected-modified nil :family PropFont :weight &#x27;normal :slant &#x27;italic) :custom-face (centaur-tabs-active-bar-face ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-default ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-selected ((t (:family PropFont)))) (centaur-tabs-unselected ((t (:family PropFont))))) 
 If you need more context i can put my entire init on pastebin or such, but this is all that&#x27;s centaur tabs related.
 Any hint on what i&#x27;m doing wrong would be awesome.

                              <span>Is it possible to have Eglot use the major mode indent-level variable when formatting the buffer. Instead of inserting a ?
 Example, js-indent-level value is 4. Eglot overwrite those 4 spaces with 1  making the indentation 8 spaces wide, which is Emacs default size.
 An option would be to set the default tab-size to 4. But I would rather having Eglot just using the indentation step defined in major-mode.
 Is there an option for this? I can&#x27;t seem to find it.

 Emacs version is compiled from Master (so, 29.0.50)
 *straight-process* seems to indicate that the error centres on git, and, indeed,
  
 git clone --origin origin --no-checkout https\://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs/nongnu.git /home/centy/.config/emacs/straight/repos/nongnu-elpa/ --no-single-branch 
 Also fails with the same error when I run it from the command line. 
 That error I&#x27;ve tracked to a &quot;no-fix&quot; in 2016 from RMS himself… https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug&#x3D;22690
 I find it hard to believe that other &quot;build-from-master, using-straight&quot; folk have not found some kind of workaround.
 What am I missing here?

 Recently started experimenting with some ideas in this space but I&#x27;m not great at gathering eyeballs and am in need of critical input. It may very well be that I&#x27;m being unreasonable and should just go through therapy to get rid of my tooling/process rage. 😅
 📌 Asking the Emacs community because of our focus on FLOSS, data ownership and the ability for end-users to control how to consume/produce information which are ideas we want to prioritize and believe align well with this communicate. I&#x27;m well aware that we can&#x27;t ask teams to all use Emacs so we&#x27;re thinking of ways how we allow folks to collaborate better without ripping them away from …</span>

 I cloned the git repo from https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git and tried to build it with make configure&#x3D;&quot;--with-native-compilation&quot;. It dies when it tested out to see if JIT was working. I followed the instructions, downloaded the sample program, compiled it with gcc -I/opt/homebrew/include tut01-hello-world.c -o tut01-hello-world -lgccjit -L/opt/homebrew/lib/gcc/12 and then tried to execute the result but I got:  ./tut01-hello-world ld: library not found for -lemutls_w libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver NULL result% 
 I see I have /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/lib/gcc/current/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin21/12/libemutls_w.a and a symbolic link to it at /opt/homebrew/lib/gcc/current/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin21/12/libemutls_w.a but I don&#x27;t know how to alter the library search path on macOS and I&#x27;m not sure if that is the way way to address this issue or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong more fundamentally.

                              <span>Just came across strange difference between produced executable image by 8.10.7 and 9.4.3 versions of GHC.

 What happened to the compiler? Or is it anyhow related to changes in basic runtime/prelude/GC?
 It has been a while since I fiddled with haskell, not followed GHC&#x27;s development. Any idea about the cause?

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m trying to set up a simple environment for learning and playing around with Haskell, and writing some small programs.

Most people seem to recommend emacs, vim, or VS Code as their editor for Haskell. I&#x27;m not interested in using emacs or vim, so VS Code it is.
 I followed the recommendations on haskell.org and installed GHCup, and then using that installed GHC, cabal, stack, and the haskell language server, and then I installed the Haskell extension for VS Code. Then I noticed that extension doesn&#x27;t seem to have a REPL or support for debugging, so I also installed the Haskell GHCi Debug Adapter extension. So far, so good, but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to actuall…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m putting the finishing touches on my second &quot;real&quot; Haskell project*, and now that I find myself (mostly) able to get some (simple, practical) stuff done with the language, I&#x27;d like to spend some time learning more about how to put types to work.
 I mostly-get some of the basic big ideas: make invalid states un-representable, e.g. Use a type that encodes your constraints in some way (like NonEmpty!). I found lots of good advice in this blog post, and several others by the same author. (I tried to put it to work in my own code, restricting the domain of a finicky function, which felt like a nice, if small, win.)
 Anyway, I feel like I&#x27;m still only scratching the surface. Reading posts like this or the &quot;types&quot; section in the &quot;State of the Haskell ecosystem&quot; gets me really excited, but doesn&#x27;t leave me with much in the way of practical advice.
 Are there are good/recommended resources for digging deeper into this kind of stuff? I stumbled across Thinking with Types today, which seems like it could be a good fit. I also see there&#x27;s a chapter on &quot;Basic Type Level Programming&quot; in Production Haskell. I&#x27;ve also found various blogs and reddit posts, of course, but nothing super-comprehensive. (And &quot;Type-driven development&quot; sounds cool, but I&#x27;m not ready to branch into Idris yet.)
 I&#x27;d love any recommendations, pointers, tips-and-tricks... whatever you&#x27;ve got to offer! Thanks!
 ​
 \Any feedback is welcome, by the way, if anybody feels like digging through beginner code. It feels weird to work/learn in a vacuum. Looking at it now I already see some deficiencies, but I&#x27;m sure there are plenty that I don&#x27;t see...*

                              <span>Background: I am relatively new to Emacs, and in org-mode in particular. Just this week I started using org-mode to prepare my papers, assignments, laboratory reports, etc. My only trouble is the exported tables to PDF.
 If the table have three columns with just short entries, I have no problem. But when the entries inside the table is long, the table extends to the right (outside the margin) of the page.
 Example:
 | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 In the header I have this:
 #+title: Sample Paper in Org #+subtitle: Paper Presentation #+author: Some One #+latex_header: \usepackage[a4paper,text&#x3D;{6.25in,9in}, truedimen]{geometry} 
 I tried reading the org-mode manual but I couldn&#x27;t figure it out how to make my table look nice.
 I did something like this:
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment tabu | Sequence | Score | Position | Remarks | |----------------------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------| | TGCCGGCACCACCGCGTGTA | 97 | 1258 | This is a long text describing this sequence and another text here | | CGCGTGTAGGGCGGAGTAAA | 89 | 856 | Another long text in this second row of table | | CGGCACCACCGCGTGTAGGG | 91 | 21 | Another remark | 
 and in the header I add: #+latex_header: \usepackage{tabu}.
 The result is the same:

 Is there any way how can I fix this?
 ​
 EDIT: I invoke the M-x org-pandoc-export-to-latex-pdf keybindings to generate the PDF.
 EDIT: By the way, I am using Doom Emacs.

 I&#x27;m trying to improve my task management in orgmode but keep getting some questions and doubts about it. My current workflow involves one big tasks.org to manage all my customer tasks and projects (around 30 customers). I tag each with their respective tag, that way I can filter by customer in org-agenda.
 After marking DONE, I archive the task/projects to a single archive2022.org file. My main objective for maintaining an archive is for generating clocktables and analyze time spent with each customer, which task/projects took me the most time, etc., and eventually bill that time.
 For some comments I read in reddit, it seems that some users apply some zettlekasten-oriented packages for task management (ex: org-roam). Applying it to my use case and workflow, like replacing a big ta…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I have a legacy code, trying to integrate with ZIO,
 I have a ZIO[SomerService, Throwable, Something] which I want to run unsafely
 SomeService is a ZLayer created like this:
 object SomeService { 
 def layer: ZLayer[SomeCache, Throwable, SomeService] &#x3D; ZLayer.fromFunction(SomeServiceLive(_)) }
 so, this requires a cache.
 I want to run it unsafely. So I created a runtime:
 val zioRuntime: Runtime.Scoped[SomeService] &#x3D; zio.Unsafe.unsafe { implicit unsafe &#x3D;&gt; zio.Runtime.unsafe.fromLayer( SomeCache.layer &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeService.layer ) 
 }
 Now I already have some uncertainity. For the runtime would I really need to build theh dependency tree manually, using &gt;&gt;&gt; and ++, while, normally, in the mainprog we can just use .provide() with the list of all dependencies?
 But anyway, I build the runt…</span>

                              <span>Hey a folks,
 I&#x27;ve looked around but so far haven&#x27;t found any package that would provide support for working with Age-encrypted files: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
 I am strongly considering just writing some helper methods etc. I see some potential problems. For example ideally I&#x27;d love to have an editing support where I open age encrypted file, it gets unencrypted in the buffer and reencrypted on save, but not sure it is possible to easily re-encrypt file to the same recipients (without hardcoding a list in code/variable)
 Anyway - thought I&#x27;d ask if there&#x27;s anything that already exists by any chance and I just missed it (age is not exactly a searchable term).

                              <span>I started learning Emacs with Doom Emacs. I got a really nice development environment for RJSX and as a matter of fact, I would still be using that as my main editing suite for RJSX and using it professionally but I have to admit. I have spent around 3 months with Doom Emacs now and in that time I also started following along system crafters videos to build my own config but I have to say that unfortunately, I&#x27;m a person that switches often between a lot of different languages and platforms and tools. 
 e.g. While I&#x27;m working as a freelancer in RJSX I also develop blender plugins and I&#x27;m also learning unreal engine 5 and WebGL on the side.
 For someone like me, I was finding that I&#x27;d have to spend 3-4 days dedicatedly crafting an environment for every new requirement I have. I do a lot of different minor development-related things and this was really killing my will to work. 
 But, emacs did force me to learn evil mode for editing and I have to say I&#x27;d always use that till the day I die now. I cannot imagine how I didn&#x27;t. I also added a magit plugin and an org mode plugin on vscode and also using the vspacecode plugin for spacemacs like keybindings now. 
 My affair with emacs would definitely continue for a long time, I&#x27;m sure. But unfortunately, the barrier of entry is rather high for someone like me who wants to do a lot of things and honestly for the time being I&#x27;d have to hop back to VSCode to edit a lot of different things. I am a little disappointed but still hopeful that I&#x27;d be back some time.

                              <span>Hello, I have nearly the same config on my windows10 and only Archlinux. The W10 machine is more powerful (Corei7 12thGen 32GB / Core i5 7thGen 8 gb). WHEN I load my config.org it takes 10s on windows and only 1 or 2 on Linux 
 Any possibility to debug this behaviour? Thanks for your advises

                              <span>I added this in my config a long time ago, unusually enough I didn&#x27;t add a link to a source site. And I don&#x27;t recall finding out about it myself.
 After a recent experiment trying not using company nor fido/icomplete, I found it again, and it seems that it doesn&#x27;t make any difference at all no matter where I try it.
 I was looking at the source a few minutes ago and usage within icomplete.el but couldn&#x27;t quite crack what is it about. From the name I assumed something like &quot;use icomplete for capf&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case from looking at icomplete sources.
 Does anyone know what does this variable do?

 I have looked at swank-js, indium, and skerrick, but none works out of the box (1~2 hours of investment didn&#x27;t result in anything). Are there people getting this workflow working in Emacs?
 Looking for something like SLIME.
 EDIT: After hours of toil, I have gotten Indium to work.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a function where it takes [String] and returns [String] after doing some stuff with it. What I am struggling with is accounting for \n within the input. For example:
 testStrings:: String &quot;test\n\ \\n\n\n\ \nstring&quot; 
 Doing take 5 (lines testStrings) returns [&quot;test&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;string&quot;] which is expected. That return list is essentially [&quot;test\n&quot;,&quot;\n&quot;,&quot;\n&quot;,&quot;\n&quot;,&quot;string&quot;] if I am not mistaken. What I want to return is [&quot;test\n&quot;,&quot;\n\n\n&quot;,&quot;string&quot;]. I want to have that middle line stay together and not break into new lines. How would I go about this?

 import Data.Constraint (Constraint, Dict (..), type (:-) (..)) type family All :: (k -&gt; Constraint) -&gt; [k] -&gt; Constraint type family All c xs where All _ &#x27;[] &#x3D; () All c (x &#x27;: xs) &#x3D; (c x, All c xs) 
 However, GHC is unable to figure out the following:
 type T :: [Type] -&gt; Type foo :: All Monoid r &#x3D;&gt; T r -&gt; Bool bar :: All Semigroup r &#x3D;&gt; T r -&gt; Bool baz :: All Monoid r &#x3D;&gt; T r -&gt; Bool baz t &#x3D; foo t &amp;&amp; bar t -- This is an error: cannot deduce &#x60;All Semigroup r&#x60; from &#x60;All Monoid r&#x60; -- The workaround solution is to change the type of &#x60;baz&#x60; to baz :: (All Monoid r, All Semigroup r) &#x3D;&gt; T r -&gt; Bool -- but this is pretty annoying and cumbersome -- &#x60;All Monoid r&#x60; does imply &#x60;All Semigroup r&#x60;, I just need to prove it to GHC 
 One solution is to write a function with the type below, however I have no clue how to go about it
 -- | Map a constraint implication across a type-level list mapImpl :: (forall a. c1 a :- c2 a) -&gt; All c1 r :- All c2 r mapImpl &#x3D; Sub Dict -- ERROR 
 Is this possible? Or would some implementation require additional class constraints on r. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hey,
 I want to create a one line function &quot;argmax&quot; using fold where I enter an anonymous/lambda function and a list. Then I apply the function to the list and get a new list based on the function. Now I get the maximum value of the second list and return the element from the first list which created the maximum value when applied to the function.
 It should look like this:
 Input: argmax (\x -&gt; mod x 5) [1,4,7]
 the second list should be: [1,4,2]
 The Maximum element from the second list is 4 so it should return 4 from the first list, because mod 4 5 is 4.
 So the output should be: 4
 Currently I have this:
 argmax :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; a
 argmax f xs &#x3D; foldr max f xs
 but it doesnt work for a anonymous function
 I get this error: No instance for (Show (Integer -&gt; Integer))
 which I don&#x27;t really understand.
 I tried to change the type signature, but that did not help.
 thanks in advance! ^

                              <span>I am trying to write a One line function where you enter a number and a List, and it returns the highest value.
 For example:
 Input: getMax 5 [1,4,7] 
 Output: 7
 Here is my current code:
 getMax :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; a getMax f xs &#x3D; foldr max f xs 
 Now I want to extend my function so that instead of a number I can enter a Lamda function to be compared.
 For example:
 Input: getMax (\x -&gt; mod x 5) [1,4,7] 
 Output: 4
 But I cannot get it to work.
 I get an error message:
 No instance for (Show (Integer -&gt; Integer)) 
 which I don&#x27;t really understand.
 I tried to change the type signature, but that did not help.

 Can an ordinary person with no background in programming or computer science, learn Haskell by themselves? Would it be complicated? I do know that Haskell may not be the most ideal choice for beginner programming since it&#x27;s quite complicated, especially considering it uses lambda calculus.. 
 I&#x27;d appreciate any suggestions!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been growing my love for org mode for some time now (and emacs for me is mostly the OS org mode is running on..) however using doom (and before spacemacs) I have never really found the visual appearance of my org files to help me find information I put in them.
 Other note take tools, mostly the paid versions (roam, obsidian etc) appear to have a nice typography spacing margins etc.
 As I am not so proficient in styling this myself I wanted to ask: Do you have any good examples for a &quot;well styled&quot; org mode and what are your approaches.
 Screenshots welcome, of course :))

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m using the &quot;olivetti&quot; package with a line width of 80 characters (olivetti-body-width 80). The text is centered. This setting works fine for a fixed-pitch font. However, when I&#x27;m using a variable-pitch font such as Times New Roman, the 80 characters per line allow up to 100 characters per line to fit. This is due to the nature of variable-pitch fonts where characters are not equal in width like monospaced fonts.
 100 characters per line is too long for optimal reading and increasing the font size doesn&#x27;t help. The font is already at a large size. 
 What would be the solution? To reduce the olivetti 80 characters per line setting to 70 characters per line which will compensate for the variable pitch font? But that will cause the programming modes that use a fixed-pitch font to have short lines.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to find the most efficient way or a small function to:
  
parse a list of org files in a directory
 grab their :properties: under a headline
 narrow to a certain subset of them (say 5 or so)
 sort them according to a date on one of the props
 list them in column view
  
taken a couple shots at this as well as searching on things like org-collector but not really finding an easy way to do this (which makes org-mode look way harded than obsidian where I did this with dataview pretty simply)
 Anyone got any pointers to something similar or an example. My lisp-fu is weak (looks down at floor) so thought I&#x27;d ask for help rather than thrash here.

                              <span>There is an inherent beauty to be found in simple, pervasive ideas that shift
our perspective on familiar objects. Such ideas can help tame the complexity of
abstruse abstractions by offering a more intuitive angle from which to
understand them.
The aim of this post is to present an alternative angle — that of interactive
semantics — from which to view one of the fundamental notion of functional
programming: higher-order functions.
Interactive semantics provide an intuitive understanding of the concept of
higher-order functions, which is a worthy mathematical investigation in itself.
But this approach is also practical, shedding a new light on existing
programming techniques and programming language features. We will review the
example of higher-order contracts in this post. We will also p…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a function where it adds the total char count of a list. For example, an input of testLength [&quot;test&quot;, &quot;string&quot;] should return [4, 10] since the test has 4 letters and string has 6, but it gets added to the 4. An input with 3 elements would add all 3 of them together on the 3rd and so on. I currently have:
 testLength :: [String] -&gt; [Int] testLength ss &#x3D; [length s | s &lt;- ss] 
 Using the previous example, this returns [4, 6] because it does not add in the 4. I know I need addition somewhere but Haskell isn&#x27;t very nice when it comes to creating variables within functions to hold a value so I am not sure how to keep the 4 in order to add it to the 6.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bit confused on monadState type class and don&#x27;t really know where to start to understand them. When talking about an example like:
 function1 :: monadState Int m &#x3D;&gt; String -&gt; m String 
 I know that String would be the input and that m String is supposed to be the output, but how would that be formatted? Also, does the monadState Int m have any interference with the input string? To further the example, if funtion1 were to be a function where it counts words in a string and returns the string with the count, would be as simple as having the format as something like:
 funtion1 s &#x3D; s ++ m 
 or is there some monad stuff to worry about? Obviously somewhere in function1 would be the actual code to count the words in the string. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve built a open source haskell library ( which is awsome ,thanks to Haskells type system ! ) . Before this package , I tried with two dynamic typed language but failed becasue of complex type invovled.
 The package aimes to a niche market and few user is interested to deploy it to their own env . But they raised the concern to me that , &#x60;&#x60;Haskell&#x60;&#x60; is non-main stream programming language as they are using Java /CPP etc .
 eventhough I setup a RESTful interface for them but they hesitated.
 should I walk away as they are not the right target user ? ( but it&#x27;s a niche market, there isn&#x27;t much user , should I just give up on them ?)
 or should I put effort to &#x60;thrift&#x60; or &#x60;gRPC&#x60; that would make it easier to intergrate with ecosystem ? eventhough I suspect this help or not

 FOSDEM 2023 will be held on 4 &amp; 5 February 2023, in Brussels. For more information see the official site. The Haskell devroom (specialist track) will take place on Sunday 5 February, from 13:10 to 17:00 UTC+1.
 We need more proposals! We need your help!
 This is an amazing opportunity to promote Haskell, and functional programming generally, to a legion of free software developers and enthusiasts. But right now, we are not even close to filling our schedule. If we don&#x27;t fill our ~4 hour schedule, the Haskell devroom will not happen.
 Therefore we are extending our Call for Proposals until Saturday 2022-12-10. We are also now welcoming proposals for tutorials/workshops and longer presentations (up to 45 minutes). Shorter presentations are still welcome, of course.
 So if you want to propose an introductory workshop, install fest, hack session, or something similar, have at it.
 You can also help by sharing this CFP far and wide, and with specific people you think might have something interesting to present.
 Thanks,
 Fraser Tweedale

                              <span>TL;DR, prototyped a library providing an IOE e a type that tracks the exceptions that can occur in an action that interacts with the real world. Relies on the normal runtime exception system, so no performance hit as ExceptT.
 Curious what people think about this. I know there&#x27;ve been many a blog posts on how to improve this, but I have yet to see any writings on this specific approach. IMO this approach gets us a lot more type safety at the expense of a bit more verbosity.
 Currently not on Hackage yet, since it&#x27;s still in the prototyping phase, but if there&#x27;s interest, there could certainly be an organized effort to get a full library on Hackage, get it used in production, and even possibly open a GHC proposal to merge into base (more details in README).

                              <span>I feel pretty dumb asking this, let alone how I’ll feel reading the answer, 
 I used paredit. sometimes I’m editing code and the parenthesis have become a bit of a mess. Sometimes I want to delete them. 
 Paraedit won’t let me, so occasionally I need to turn the mode and delete a parenthesis or two then re-enable it. 
 This does not seem like the way. 
 How should it be used and if this is a feature is there another package which might be worth trying?

                              <span>Since treesitter will be a built-in in Emacs 29, would it be feasible to base something like paredit / smartparens / puni on it?
 Something which operates on all types of source code in a generic way? Or is this out of scope?
 Is there already some project in that direction to contribute?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m new to using eglot + flymake. Before I used out of the box solutions like spacemacs, but I&#x27;ve been trying to learn more. 
 My problem is that it seems like the buffer eglot is using to error check my code is out of sync from the buffer I&#x27;m editing in. See the attached image for details. I&#x27;m not really sure what to do or what may be causing this. This also may be a flymake problem, but I&#x27;m not sure on how eglot+flymake play together. Any help would be appreciated.
 ​
 If I edit the variable name say to \&quot;dsavedStyles\&quot;, then flymake reports \&quot;Use of undeclared identifier &#x27;dsavedStylesalw&#x27;;\&quot; which is still wrong, but strange

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 When I&#x27;m editing a big org-mode file sometimes I mistype an extra bracket somewhere and emacs freezes. This started happening just after I enabled smartparens&#x27; pair highlighting using
 (show-smartparens-global-mode +1) in my ~/.doom.d/config.el file,
 so it&#x27;s pretty clear its because of it scanning the whole buffer looking for the matching bracket to highlight.
 Is there a variable I can set to give a line / chars / milliseconds roof to this?
 Thank you all.
 UPDATE: I just realized it is not about the highlighting itself, but smartparents in general.
 I toggled show-smartparents-global-more, I had no highligting but the freezing happened anyway.

                              <span>When I enable the three modes in the title, moving up and down with the arrow keys places the cursor in the wrong column when on a line with substituted symbols. The offset seems to be related to the org-indent depth.
 I&#x27;ve searched and searched but have not found a solution other than disabling one of the three modes.
 Here&#x27;s a minimal repro. Anyone dealt with this in their config or have advice on how to hunt down the problem? I&#x27;m not even sure which project to make a bug report in.
 (use-package org :mode ((&quot;\\.org$&quot; . org-mode)) :ensure org-plus-contrib :hook ((org-mode . org-indent-mode) (org-mode . visual-line-mode)) ; alternatively, comment the following lines and uncomment org-modern :config (add-to-list &#x27;font-lock-extra-managed-props &#x27;display) (font-lock-add-keywords &#x27;org-mode &#x27;((&quot;^\\(-\\)\\( \\)&quot; 1 &#x27;(face nil display &quot;•&quot;)))) ) ; (use-package org-modern ; :ensure t ; :after org ; :hook ((org-mode . (lambda () (org-modern-mode))))) 
 Try on this file. When the cursor is on item 1 (which has a prettified bullet), moving down to item 2, then up again places the cursor 2 to the right of where it was before.

                              <span>I have MELPA&#x27;s stable archive in my init.el and all my configuration files are located in ~/.config/emacs/ (based on X-Directory).
 If I make a change to any of these files they do into effect, but when I try to install a package, the mini-buffer shows the default directory: Directory ‘~/.emacs.d/’ does not exist; create? (y or n).
 How can I ensure that MELPA installs packages in the Emacs directory located inside XDG home ($HOME/.config/emacs) instead of the default user home (~/.emacs.d) ?

                              <span>Hey, Scala CLI v0.1.18 has been released! Feel free to try it out. Changes include:
  
easier filtering of tests with --test-only;
 better support for authenticated proxies;
 better support for Markdown sources (running Markdown from GitHub Gists, URLs, snippets, etc.);
 and a whole set of other tweaks &amp; fixes, details on the release page.
  
For those who do not know it, Scala CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language. It&#x27;s great for learning the language, writing scripts, prototyping and such.
 As of SIP-46, it is also in the implementation phase of becoming the new official Scala runner.Feel free to try out the scala-experimental installation.

                              <span>Hey everyone! I&#x27;m a bit new to the whole Zettelkasten system, but I think I&#x27;ve almost figured out enough to get started. The only thing I&#x27;m still confused about is how I should deal with citing the sources of my information.
For example, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a passage like this:

  
It’s important to understand the layers that make up a design, because getting those layers to work together is the key to creating designs that look good, that solve problems, and that ultimately influence your users.


For the Zettel, should I always start it with &quot;According to [so and so]...&quot;, or should I just omit that and essentially present the idea as my own? And if I come across another source that slightly expands on this, how should I express that? And how should I deal with a source contradicting this information?</span>

 I searched around a bit, but to my amazement nobody seems to discuss this.
 It shouldn&#x27;t be impossible to switch over, so I kind of expected someone has already done this :)
 What&#x27;s all your opinion on this?

                              <span>Notice the alignment of the cells in the last row of the following table.
 | Items | Quantity | |-------------------+----------| | Item 1 | 4 | | Item 2 | 4 | | Item 3 | 4 | | Item 4 | 2 | |-------------------+----------| | Total: | 14 | 
 Is it possible to tell org that I want the cells with &#x60;Total&#x60; and &#x60;14&#x60; to have a different alignment than all other cells?

                              <span>Coming from Scala, the &#x60;Every&#x60; type seems to be much more coherent. In Purescript it seems like I am forever having to change between the two types to leverage basic functionality.
 For example I feel like I&#x27;m doing crazy stuff like the following code. I&#x27;ve got a &#x60;NonEmptyArray&#x60; but the only way to add a new value seems to be to convert back to &#x60;Array&#x60; use the &#x60;cons&#x60; infix operator, then convert back to NonEmptyArray....
 Pretty sure I&#x27;m doing something wrong here...But this difficulty in usage combined with the &#x60;NonEmpty Array&#x60; vs &#x60;NonEmptyArray&#x60; types got be confused. Has anyone got a solid undestanding?

 About Wasp
 It has been a almost 2 years since we launched Alpha version of Wasp, and today we got to Beta!
 In that time Wasp grew a lot regarding stability and feature-fulness, we assembled a stable team, had more than 1000 Wasp projects kickstarted, had a user win a hackaton with Wasp, another user made an app in Wasp that has proper paying customers, third user created an internal tool in his company, ... .
 Next, we will focus on making Wasp easier to use (examples, starter templates, UI helpers). Longer term, we’ll look into tighter weaving of data models with the rest of the stack and expanding the DSL with more functionalities. Lot o…</span>

 P.S.: I don&#x27;t have an experience with Haskell.

                              <span>Hi all -- I&#x27;m attempting to write a basic, type-directed program synthesis application using the ghc library. One issue I have run into is in comparing the types of arguments in polymorphic functions. 
 I would like to be able to take a function of type, say, &#x60;Identity a -&gt; b&#x60; and compare the first argument for equality with a known type &#x60;Identity a&#x60;. I would like to use the &#x60;eqType&#x60; function in GHC.Core.Type, but I don&#x27;t know how to correctly separate the function type to do so.
 There are helper functions like &#x60;splitFunTy_maybe&#x60;, but that cannot be directly applied to my function type since it is wrapped in a &#x60;Forall&#x60; type constructor. My (very hacky) solution right now involves stripping the &#x60;Forall&#x60; constructor, splitting the bare function, then comparing the two types on their type constructors (in this case, &#x60;Identity&#x60;).
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a better way to go about this, because I&#x27;m having trouble extending my current solution to broader applications. Any help from ghc wizards would be greatly appreciated!

  --test.hs counter &#x3D; \x -&gt; (\x -&gt; x + 1) 
 When I tried to run in the REPL:
  :l test.hs counter 1 
 I got the following error msg
  
:175:1: error: 
 • No instance for (Show (Integer -&gt; Integer)) 
 arising from a use of ‘print’ 
 (maybe you haven&#x27;t applied a function to enough arguments?) 
 • In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
  
Any help would be very much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to finally learn a bit more Haskell than my current smattering. In fact, I&#x27;m going to try the Advent of Code in it, as a forcing function.
 I&#x27;m trying to get a better handle on performance. For example, I really don&#x27;t understand why the foldl&#x27; implementation in Data.List,
  foldl&#x27; :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b {-# INLINE foldl&#x27; #-} foldl&#x27; f z0 &#x3D; \ xs -&gt; foldr (\ (x::a) (k::b-&gt;b) -&gt; oneShot (\ (z::b) -&gt; z &#x60;seq&#x60; k (f z x))) (id::b-&gt;b) xs z0 
 works so much better in GHCi than my naive implementation,
  foldl&#x27; f !z [] &#x3D; z foldl&#x27; f !z (x:xs) &#x3D; foldl&#x27; f (f z x) xs 
 Sure, that one is better than just using foldl or foldr, but it still takes about 2 s in GHCi or runghc to sum 1 to 10M. Compiled, it takes 0.2 s (reasonable), but plain-vanilla Python or Scheme (guile) only take about 0.5 s.
 The Data.List implementation takes about 0.5 s, much more in line with what I expect a reasonable interpreter to do, but I don&#x27;t understand how it does it.
 Can someone walk me through it? I&#x27;d like to figure out how to make things run quickly in GHCi for while I&#x27;m going through Advent of Code problems. More generally, how should I think about performance?
 (And yes, I&#x27;ve read the comment in the code, but I didn&#x27;t understand it.)
 Edit: In particular, if someone could help walk me through the comment in https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/src/GHC.List.html#foldl%27, I&#x27;d appreciate it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Vim user who is trying to migrate to emacs. On Vim, I&#x27;ve been using the following function to execute code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; function! ExecuteOnTerminal(type) range if (&amp;ft&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x27;bash&#x27; || &amp;ft&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x27;sh&#x27;) if a:type &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;V&quot; :vert botright &#x27; %terminal bash else :vert botright %terminal bash endif elseif (&amp;ft&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x27;python&#x27;) if a:type &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;V&quot; :vert botright &#x27; %terminal python3 else :vert botright %terminal python3 endif elseif (&amp;ft&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x27;awk&#x27;) if a:type &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;V&quot; &#x27;w! /tmp/file.awk else :w! /tmp/file.awk endif :vert botright terminal awk -f /tmp/file.awk /home/user/sampleFile endif endfunction
 vnoremap   :call ExecuteOnTerminal(&quot;V&quot;) nnoremap   :call ExecuteOnTerminal(&quot;I&quot;) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Basically, it detects if I&#x27;m selecting lines or not. If I press F10, it&#x27;ll execute the selected lines or the entire file depending on the type of the file. I&#x27;d like to create a similar function on emacs. I know that for that I&#x27;d need:
  
A function that detects the language of the file like &amp;ft does on vimscript.
 A way of detecting if I&#x27;m selecting lines or not on the current file and getting the content of it.
 Something like the terminal command from vim, it executes the code on a split window.
  
I&#x27;d like to create my own personalized function because I end up having more control of what&#x27;s happening, like the last elseif that I&#x27;m executing awk code with the data of a hardcoded file. This way I can handle multiple types of files with a single shortcut... But I&#x27;m having trouble finding equivalent elisp functions for the three points that I&#x27;ve listed here. Can anyone help me on that? Or give me some advice for executing code on emacs (not org files, just plain scripts .py, .sh, .bash, .js and so on)?

                              <span>So.
 I decided to rewrite my init.el, as it has... grown a fair bit, in unstructured way, and decided to fix that. 
 And thought, while doing that, I might as well, try different package manager.
 Can&#x27;t decide whether to use straight.el, or elpaca.. they both seem nice #_#

 Ultimately, I want my entire system to be emacs, and I would like to be able to open htop in a buffer.

                              <span>Hello everyone ! 
 I recently had to update my system and since then I&#x27;ve noticed something odd with pyright. When I open a project and my lsp server starts with pyright, the file I first opened to open the project doesn&#x27;t work well. I don&#x27;t get the usual autocompletion, the errors listed by flycheck all appear in the first in the first lines and don&#x27;t get removed if i correct the acutal error, ....
 And this only happens in the very first file which started the server ! On top of that I&#x27;ve also noticed that it only happens when I have more than one listed lsp workspace folder using pyright.
 My current workaround is to kill the buffer and reopen the file again but it would beetter if I could get rid of it entirely.
 I use doom emacs with pyright and lsp and I also use pyenv for my virtualenvs with the pyenv package which allows emacs to automatically detect the local version I set for a project and use it. 
 It&#x27;s very weird and I have a hard time finding the root of the problem so if someone had a similar issue at some point or as any clue on what to do it would be very much appreciated !

                              <span>In my version of Org, inline code interacts weirdly with quotation marks. If I write something like
 ~&quot;foo&quot;~ bar ~baz~ 
 Then the entire line will be rendered as inline code, whereas I&#x27;d expect just &quot;foo&quot; and baz to be rendered that way.
 Weirdly, this only happens with code, not with any other type of emphasis marker.
 My Google-fu doesn&#x27;t seem to be working here; I found this Stack Overflow post, it&#x27;s completely unrelated AFAICT (for one thing, if org-emphasis-alist were the problem, then all types of emphasis markers should be affected).

                              <span>As an exercise in learning Lisp, I am trying to write a pattern
 matching routine that I can call
 like (match pattern form) where both pattern and form are just
 forms. My ultimate goal is to perform tree-manipulations via structural editing and macroexpansion of lisp forms, where after the manipulation, I am left with a lisp form that evaluates to something useful. Because working with code is a macro&#x27;s domain, I thought using them would be the most natural way forward. However,
 due to the recursive nature of the problem, I need to call match
 from within itself to see if a sub-pattern successfully matched
 a sub-form. This leads to write things like (eval \(match&#x60;
 ,sub-pattern ,sub-form)) inside the macro. This feels like an
 ugly hack, but the alternative would be to use functions and
 quote
 every input, leading to (match \(quote ,sub-pattern) &#x60;(quote&#x60;
 ,sub-form)) . Both of these make me feel like I am doing
 something wrong, surely there is a clean, lispy way of doing
 this. Is there an idiomatic way to write the routine? Should
 this be a task for functions or macros?

                              <span>In plaintext files, I am getting 4 spaces inserted when I hit Tab, but ONLY for the first level of indentation. Each subsequent Tab inserts 2 spaces.
 I expect each time I hit Tab to have the same number of spaces inserted (if I describe-variable tab-width, it is 2). Any ideas why the first Tab inserts FOUR spaces instead of two?
 When searching for answers to this issue, other people mention separate variables such as js-indent-level, c-basic-offset, etc. But I am seeing this issue in plaintext, so I&#x27;m not sure what corresponding variable might make sense here?
 Thanks!

 It turns out Marginalia is the which-key equivalent for Vertico.
 ORIGINAL POST FOLLOWS:
 Howdy! I&#x27;m trying to use vertico, but I noticed which-key no longer shows the keys for things when I use M-x. It still works with other keybinds, like C-x. Is there a way to make this work again?

From my own experience, I knew a little bit of vim, then I used spacemacs, and finally landed into doom. The evil keybindings and Alt-X with command search basically provide everything I need for me to get around. I do not know a single thing about lisp, usually just search others configs on github and try to copy what I feel that could be useful for my case. A lot of times I run through a lot of errors that I do not even know where to start debugging because truth be told I don&#x27;t want to learn lisp in order to use a text editor that I mainly wanna use for ORG MODE and pdf …</span>

                              <span>I was working on a large project and using lots of make, make clean, configure and other commands that triggered large streams of output in my shell. It was getting hard to keep track of which output came from which input.
 So I came up with this solution: it makes a &#x27;sticky&#x27; header that always shows the prompt corresponding to the top-visible output-line (hard to explain but see screenshots for reference)
 (defun comint-get-prompt-above () &quot;Get the prompt above the top visible line in the current window.&quot; (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (window-start)) (comint-previous-prompt 1) (let ((prompt (thing-at-point &#x27;line))) (aset prompt (- (length prompt) 1) 0) ; remove the newline ending char prompt))) (define-minor-mode comint-sticky-mode &quot;Minor mode to show the previous prompt as a sticky header.&quot; :group &#x27;comint :global nil :lighter nil (if comint-sticky-mode (setq-local header-line-format (list &#x27;(:eval (comint-get-prompt-above)))) (setq-local header-line-format nil)))

I&#x27;d like some feedback on my solution.
 Code-wise I&#x27;m wondering if there is a more efficient solution, maybe without calling comint-next-prompt
 I figured other people might find this feature useful: feel free to paste it in your config and let me know your experience.
 If people are interested, I&#x27;m wondering if I should create a package for this.
 On the one hand I&#x27;d like the feature to be available to whoever wants it. But also it&#x27;s such a small piece of code that maybe just sharing it as a snippet is enough. Unless there are possible enhancements, or additional related features that might go well with this?

                              <span>I noticed over the weekend that the venerable Selectrum package made by Radon Rosborough has been deprecated in favor of Daniel Mendler&#x27;s Vertico package.
 Looks like this whole journey started in May when Daniel suggested Vertico replace Selectrum. selectrum#598 The amount of humility and civility displayed by both Radon and Daniel has been inspiring—not something you see often in the software world.
 My journey has been Helm → Ivy → Selectrum → Vertico, and I can confidently say that Vertico has been the fastest, most reliable, and least buggy of them all. Thank you to all you Emacs package maintainers, but especially Radon and Daniel for working so hard to make lightweight completion the best it could be!

 I want to automate the creation of a new denote journal file each day. I want to verify if it already exists, if not create it and then find the previous journal, check if there are TODO/SCHEDULED/DEADLINE tasks and move them into the new journal.
 For now I have the following:
 (require &#x27;cl-lib) ;; needed for cl-return (defun journal-day-exists-p ( target ) &quot;check if journal for a day already exists&quot; (file-expand-wildcards (concat (denote-directory) target &quot;*_journal*.org&quot;))) (defun find-previous-journal () &quot;Find most recent journal&quot; (let* ((today (format-time-string &quot;%Y%m%d&quot;)) (all_journals (sort (directory-files &quot;~/Dropbox/orgfiles/denotes&quot; nil &quot;^[0-9].*_journal.*org$&quot;) #&#x27;string&gt;))) (dolist (journal all_journals) (when (string&lt; (substring journal 0 8) today) (cl-return journal))))) (defun my-denote-journal () &quot;Create an entry tagged &#x27;journal&#x27; with the date as its title.&quot; (interactive) (let* ((today (format-time-string &quot;%Y%m%d&quot;)) (filename (car (journal-day-exists-p today))) (prev (find-previous-journal))) (if filename (find-file filename) (progn (denote (format-time-string &quot;%A %e %B %Y&quot;) ; format like Tuesday 14 June 2022 &#x27;(&quot;journal&quot;) nil &quot;~/Denotes&quot;) (insert &quot;* Thoughts\n\n* Ideas\n\n* Code\n\n* TASKS\n\n&quot;))))) 
 Now the part where I need help is in moving the Tasks, I already have the idea that I should use org-refile or org-archive, but I am not seeing how to open the previous file and get what I need from it.
 Can anyone help?
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>I strongly feel that remote code editing is one of the most important features for editors going forward.
 Tramp, while sometimes usable, has poor performance and I&#x27;ve found it to hang during many different operations. It&#x27;s not easy to debug when things go wrong, and it seems as though it&#x27;s just a product of old, single threaded code that does not compete with better ideas on remote code editing - a la VSCode&#x27;s remote server.
 Will we ever see Emacs embrace an over the network client/server split and make remote code editing a first class feature like VSCode?

When I close emacs using my window manager, it kills the buffers. Is their a way to prevent this? i.e. for the buffers to stay open? As a slightly unrelated question, is there a way to keep the layout of buffers when I quit as well?

                              <span>When my emacs crashes (seldom but though) and revisiting that file with autosave-data, I get the helpful message ... has auto save data; consider M-x recover-this-file. However, sometimes I do not even see this message because eg. a minor-mode has actions attached which uses the minibuffer. The recovery-hint message then get&#x27;s quickly buried.
 Instead I would rather have to actively take an action like use the auto-save file, ignore it, delete it, merge it ... 
 Can I configure such a behavior?

 Does anyone know how to make the switch?

                              <span>Hi, I have two questions regarding validation cases that come up frequently in my Scala codebase.
 1. Multistage validation
 I would like to break down the validation into several stages. Errors from each stage should be accumulated into the &quot;final list of errors&quot;, and a validation stage should only run on data that was successfully validated by the previous stage. In other words: each stage should return a list of validation errors along with the data that passed the validations of that stage. In addition most stages require IO to pull some data needed for the actual validation. An example using 2 stages:
 case class ValidationStatus[E]( errors: List[E], leftForValidation: List[Unvalidated] ) sealed trait Errors1 def validationStage1(values: NonEmptyList[Unvalidated]): IO[ValidationStatus…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 Do you know if the Haskell Brain course (link) is any good? I do not have experience in AI/ML and I&#x27;d like to give it a go some time, but I&#x27;m not sure how far this particular course would take me in terms of enabling me to develop any real projects, etc. The Tensorflow bindings seem to not be maintained as of today (last commit to master will make 2 years next Feb.)
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve been considering introducing Haskell for the backend of our application, and have reached a crunch point where we are starting to rewrite core services. I would like to use Haskell for this, starting with just one (new) service to see how it goes, and how the team takes to it.

                              <span>Wanted to share another note, but the book didn&#x27;t have usable endnotes, so I found myself writing about a prerequisite to making good endnotes instead.
I found the direct access/sequential access distinction interesting when I thought of how RAM works; but maybe I&#x27;ve stretched it too thin? In a blog post I&#x27;d remove the last subsection, but for my private cesspool I&#x27;m inclined to keep it 
202211261601 Endnotes require direct access via chapter marks
  #endnote #usability
To make book endnotes as usable as footnotes, each page or page spread needs to show all relevant information the reader requires to find the appropriate endnote.
Paperback endnotes are usually not optimized for &quot;direct access&quot; (aka &quot;random access&quot; as in computer RAM[[202211281004]]): Endnotes are often counted from 1 on a chapter-by-chapter basis. Then the endnotes of a book will be sectioned by chapter.
Usability problem
Non-fiction paperback books usually only print the author and book title at the top of pages, so you don&#x27;t have an easy way to know which chapter you&#x27;re in.
Example usage of bad endnotes
If you&#x27;re on page X and want to know what endnote Y is about, you need to page back until you find the beginning of the chapter, or look up the chapter&#x27;s page range in the table of contents first. Then you can navigate to the approriate section in the endnotes.
Random access vs bad sequential access
&quot;Random/direct access&quot; would be possible if one of the page headers contained the current chapter title to make finding the appropriate section in the endnotes easier. Then you&#x27;d have all the information, the complete address, to de-reference the number Y.
If you page through the book, and simultaneously advance the endnote sections and leave a bookmark there, you would get &quot;sequential access&quot; that relies on a process like this.</span>

                              <span>I am new to the Emacs/Spacemacs world and am having a bit of trouble adjusting.
 On macOS, you can do C-h in any text field to do backspace, which is nice and ergonomic to me, so I&#x27;ve got in the habit of using this key combination instead of the backspace key.
 In Emacs, I know C-h is bound to help. But in INSERT MODE, I would like to have C-h behave as backspace instead.
 I have tried putting the following into my user-config, but it seems to basically turn C-h into a NOP instead. Any ideas what I&#x27;m doing wrong here?

                              <span>Is there a built in function or package to convert from standard bibtex form to biblatex form?
 When pulling in citations from sites like Google scholar there’s no option for biblatex, and I can’t just mix styles together.
 Certain fields (like date vs year/month) need to be combined and transformed, and some TeX syntax is removed, so it’s slightly nontrivial. I can make a call to Biber as an external process to do the conversion but it’s slow (around 2 seconds).
 I’m avoiding using Zotero or Jabref etc as I’m nearly finished implementing a system that totally replaces them.
 Thanks!

 In a function, I use the following to jump to a specific heading (below, the heading would be named &quot;Example&quot; in the above file):
 (re-search-forward (concat &quot;^\\* &quot; &quot;Example&quot; &quot;$&quot;) nil t) 
 And from there I can insert a property with org-set-property for that heading.
 Everything works very well for my needs, but I kind of feel like there is probably a built-in function that does what my re-search-forward line does but in a more elegant way. However, I can&#x27;t find such a built-in function. Is there one?

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping someone can help figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong. I recently updated to Emacs 28.2 on two machines and though the native compiler is working when I run it manually, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be running automatically on packages I install with package.el nor on some personal libraries. The rest of this post has whatever details I think I might get asked about, but probably excludes some necessary details which, due to my ignorance, I don&#x27;t realize are necessary! :)
 I do now have native compilation in both installations, and for built-in functions describe-function says &quot;... is a native-compiled Lisp functions in ...&quot;. If I manually call emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load on a file, it does get compiled to native code, the corresponding .eln file gets placed in .emacs.d/eln-cache/28.2-7…</span>

 Is there a shortcut to generate signal declarations for those are missing?

 My goal is this, but I&#x27;m so far away of it...

However, I do I add #&#x27;open-with-zathura to the list of actions of embark-act?

                              <span>Hello wizards, I&#x27;ve got a weird one today.
 I&#x27;m trying to write a small package which re-defines eshell/cat. I&#x27;m doing this with
 (defun eshell/cat (&amp;rest args) &quot;doc string&quot; (do-various-things-to args)) 
 Before loading this file, which cat returns &quot;eshell/cat is a byte-compiled Lisp function in &#x27;em-unix.el&#x27;.&quot; 
 But after loading the file, which cat returns &quot;/usr/bin/cat&quot;.
 Now I can manually invoke my new function with eshell/cat, but it should be callable as just cat. Everything I&#x27;ve seen online indicates that defining eshell/ exposes  as an eshell command, as does the built-in Info manual. 
 This issue occurs whenever I start eshell and then load the file. When I load the file first, eshell&#x27;s init sequence clobbers it and restores the definition from em-unix.el.
 What is the correct way to do this?

 (progn (macro-print 1) (macro-print 2) (macro-print 3)) 
 and then each of these is evaluated in turn, which should each print a hello, where are the other 2 going?

                              <span>To make this clear upfront: I want to ask the following questions out of genuine curiosity. Because while in theory the concept sounds awesome, I don&#x27;t get the way it was implemented. And I was already close to filing a bug report for this issue that then turned out to be &quot;intended behavior&quot;.
  
The other day I ran into the situation that I had two type aliases that both mapped to Lists of something. Then I wanted to implement an extension method on both of these types with the same signature.  type A &#x3D; List[Int] type B &#x3D; List[String] extension (a: A) { def doSomething: Unit &#x3D; ??? } extension (b: B) { def doSomething: Unit &#x3D; ??? }  But the compiler refused to do that because of the methods being identical after type erasure. Okay, I get that.
 But before I proceed with the core story here,…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read a lot of resources about Zettelkasten, and there are many things I&#x27;d like to address, but this post is about prefix ID for notes. Ok, I don&#x27;t understand why you would use the popular timestamp thing. Sure, you know when the note was created, and you fixed the issue with duplicate titles (which, really, who experiences?) Other than that, what? Then you have this unclean 12-digit number in front of your note title; amazing.
I&#x27;ve been trying to use Luhmann&#x27;s 1,2,3b,3c etc., system, which works fine, but there is no convenient way to use it (I am using Obsidian). I used this 12-digit timestamp on hundreds of notes, and it&#x27;s simply useless. I need something else!
Yes, I researched other solutions, but they were not convincing and too geeky, as I recall. I wonder if someone had the same experience as me. The 12-digit timestamp prefix is missing the point of the Zettelkasten, IMO. I&#x27;m looking for alternatives and am eager to listen to others&#x27; experiences with ID prefixes methods for Zettelkasten. Thanks!</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s not as refined or as compartmentalized as Niklas Luhmann&#x27;s process, but art historian Victor Margolin broadly outlines his note taking and writing process in reasonable detail in this excellent three minute video. (This may be one of the shortest and best produced encapsulations of these reading/note taking/writing methods I&#x27;ve ever seen.)

Though he indicates it was a &quot;process [he] developed&quot;, it is broadly similar to that of the influential &quot;historical method&quot; laid out by Ernst Bernheim and later Seignobos/Langlois in the late 1800s.

                              <span>I have been working on a Zettelkasten for about 2.5 years.  One of my purposes in starting a ZK was to capture brief memories or &quot;snapshots&quot; of my past, with a focus partly on what happened and partly on how I felt (at the time) or feel (now) about that event.  I don&#x27;t pursue this in any organized way, either in relation to time or theme.  I simply deal with memories as they arise, prompted by a discussion with a friend or family member, or from looking at a photo.  The order is thus random. But I hoped that as I gathered a large number of brief memories and connected them together, they would form a somewhat coherent personal history that was also intimately tied to other zettels, such as those expressing personal values and beliefs.
This is now coming to fruition, although there is still…</span>

                              <span>Trying to figure out why emacs is only partially able to spell check. I have flyspell enabled, and it&#x27;s using enchant-2 as the spellchecker. 
 It&#x27;s able to highlight a mispelled word, but when I go to correct it, it doesn&#x27;t offer possible matches - this means I have to correct it myself, even having to google the correct spelling. Obviously not ideal.
 Any ideas why it isn&#x27;t suggesting anything?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering, are there any ways to use evil-tex (or evil-surround more broadly) for motion? For example, if I&#x27;m at a \begin{env}, I might want to jump to the matching \end{env}.
 Is there a general way to jump to the end of a surrounding-pair in evil-surround? % doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick, it only looks at parentheses and such, not custom pairs defined by evil-surround.

                              <span>I came across this weird behaviour, here&#x27;s how I got here:
  
(setq truncate-lines t) ; to truncate lines
 (global-whitespace-mode) ; to highlight trailing whitespace
 (set-display-table-slot standard-display-table &#x27;truncation ?…) ; to change the truncation character from ; &#x27;$&#x27; to &#x27;…&#x27;
  
Step 3. only seems to work when step 2. is off. I&#x27;ve tried this on both mine and stock&#x27;s config, GUI and TUI and it doesn&#x27;t change (see attachment)
 Anyone could shed a light on what&#x27;s going on?

 I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.1, org-mode 9.5.5, pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22, ImageMagick 6.9.12 running on Fedora 37.
 org-latex-packages-alistis set to &#x27;((&quot;version&#x3D;4&quot; &quot;mhchem&quot; t))
 I have tried setting org-preview-latex-default-process to dvipng, dvisvgmor, or imagemagick.
 When the org file is exported to latex and PDF, the mhchem syntax is correctly interpreted and exported. And when calling org-latex-preview on \(2 + 3\) a preview is correctly generated. However, when calling org-latex-preview on \ce{Na2CO4} nothing happens.

                              <span>The &quot;schedule&quot; API of Mastodon is super simple. But I&#x27;m not quite sure how to best handle the input 🤔
 The discussion is here: https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el/issues/285
 In short, the following works, but the fallback value of 12:00 a.m. feels like a hack:
 (require &#x27;org) (require &#x27;mastodon) (defun ct/mastodon-toot--schedule () (interactive) (let* ((time-value (org-read-date nil t nil &quot;Schedule post at:&quot; (date-to-time &quot;2022-11-26 00:00 am&quot;))) (iso8601-string (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z&quot; time-value))) (setq-local mastodon-toot--scheduled-at iso8601-string) (message (format &quot;Scheduled post for &#x27;%s&#x27;.&quot; iso8601-string)))) (define-key mastodon-toot-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c C-s&quot;) #&#x27;ct/mastodon-toot--schedule) 
 org-read-date works flawlessly otherwise.
 How&#x27;d you approach this?
 Feedback and discussion (and PRs on codeberg.org :)) welcome!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use tramp to edit files that are in a windows 10 machine through emacs tramp on macOS
 I&#x27;m getting connection failed and suspect it has something to do with tramp not recognizing the shell as i see in other posts, however i&#x27;m a newbie and unsure how to go about doing this.
 I&#x27;ve tried:
 (setq explicit-shell-file-name &quot;C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe&quot;) 
 and:
 (setq explicit-shell-file-name &quot;C:\\Windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe&quot;) 
 Emacs hangs, and after a while a buffer is shown with what would look like a successful connection, with microsoft corporation, the version etc.. but full of special characters like ^M, and i immediately get a timeout.
 I&#x27;m completely unsure of what to do at this point and would appreciate some help

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 27. I can activate hs-minor-mode in each buffer manually via M-x hs-minor-mode. No problem here.
 But I want to have that mode for python mode only. And that doesn&#x27;t work. I got no error but when I try to fold python code I got the regular message that I have to &quot;Enable one of the following modes...&quot;.
 This is the python part of my init.el where I use the :init part.
  (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :init (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook &#x27;hs-minor-mode) :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) 
 I also tried it that way using the :hook part.
  (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) (python-mode . hs-minor-mode) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) )

                              <span>I have the font installed on my PC, and it works well with other terminals such as Alacritty, but when I open my shell via the shell-mode the prompt is not displayed correctly.
 This is the view of the prompt in shell-mode, it can&#x27;t display the icons.
 Edit:
 After searching Emacs documentation, I came across chapter 14.19 How Text Is Displayed, and was able to kind of pinpoint what the issue is:
  
On text terminals, characters that cannot be displayed using the terminal encoding are normally displayed as question signs. 
  
And from chapter 22.12 Coding Systems for Terminal I/O:
  
The command C-x RET t (set-terminal-coding-system) specifies the coding system for terminal output. If you specify a character code for terminal output, all characters output to the terminal are translated into that coding system.
  
I have changed the value of this command and changed the encoding to UTF-8 but still got no result.
 This is all that I have concluded, I am still an Emacs newbie, but I am trying to learn.

                              <span>Hi y&#x27;all. I was wondering how expensive would it be, in both programmer time and money, to either mainline guile Emacs or rewrite the c core entirely.
 This isn&#x27;t a serious post. I&#x27;m just curious.

 I&#x27;m wondering, is there a way to map a key to the leader map (not the local leader map), only in a specific mode?
 Basically, I want to customize what &quot;SPC c c&quot; does per mode, since usually I want to run an elisp command, not a command line program. So in LaTeX, I want &quot;SPC c c&quot; to do #&#x27;TeX-command-run-all, but not in other modes.
 Is there a way to do this? I tried the following but it didn&#x27;t seem to work
  (map! :after LaTeX :map LaTeX-mode-map :leader &quot;c c&quot; #&#x27;TeX-command-run-all)

 No matter what I did the built-in org version seemed to persist until I hid its directory and create a new profile using the lockfile.
 This warning seems to be at the heart of the problem
  
Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for &quot;org&quot; (:repo cannot be both &quot;https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs/org-mode.git&quot; and &quot;bzg/org-mode&quot;)
  
Is there some way to redefine the recipe for a package? It seems configuring it to choose one of melpa gnu-elpa, git or some other source must be the way to go.
 It i early days for me with straight.

                              <span>I was trying to request data from an API for a toy project, and I decided to use the &#x60;req&#x60; library to do so. However, one thing I noticed is that when running a request, it does not return an &#x60;Either&#x60; type, but it just throws an error if the request fails.
 This seems very un-haskelly to me. Why is this the case, that errors are not handled with &#x60;Either&#x60;? Also, how can I handle these errors? I thought there is no such thing as a &#x60;try...catch&#x60; in haskell, but maybe I&#x27;m mistaken?

                              <span>I came across this on stackoverflow and marveled at Haskell anew as a mathematical haven. Specifically, if you scroll down to the comment made by 147pm, they say an obvious omission, i.e., that you don&#x27;t get set union commutativity when you use lists as sets -- despite clever attempts to get rid of &quot;duplicates.&quot; But then a comment below says very deep things about quotient type and commutative modulo permutations. I was wondering if someone could unpack that a bit. What&#x27;s he saying about, against the 147pm comment? Can someone direct me to resources/texts that might get into this? Once again, Haskell amazes. What other language has this?

                              <span>I was reviewing Lean 4 and really liked what I saw. Seemed like a really polished system with chance to be performant as well (strict, proper records, dependent types, mutability in do, defined contiguous array with O(1) access and Uniqueness analysis allowing for optimized mutating in place a la Swift).

 Wanted to know what people of this sub think of this language.
 Also, is it ready for prime time, where I can build non-trivial program even if for personal hobby projects.

 &#x60;simple.el&#x60; called &#x60;(defun goto-line (line &amp;optional buffer relative)&#x60;
 but would take me ages and a steep learning curve to solve such a simple use case: as user want to go to a random line in a file.
 I am wondering if there is a way to obtain that without too much hassle

                              <span>Is there some sort of self contained query language for selecting org mode nodes? i.e. something like xpath.
 Or does everyone have a different way of solving this problem?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a group in ibuffer that will include various buffers matching different regular expressions. Below is a simplified version of my current attempt:
 (defun my-agenda-group () (or (string-match-p &quot;^\\*Org-Agenda\\*.*&quot; (buffer-name)) (string-match-p &quot;.org\\&#x27;&quot; buffer-file-name))) (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote ((&quot;Default&quot; (&quot;Agenda&quot; (predicate . (my-agenda-group))))))) 
 If I understand correctly, ibuffer will apply my-agenda-group to every buffer, and will display that buffer under &quot;Agenda&quot; if the function returns non-nil for the buffer. I have called that function inside various buffers myself to check manually that it works correctly. However, this same function does not work within ibuffer-saved-filter-groups and I am unable to figure out why.

                              <span>I was using ws-butler to automatic erase traillig whitespaces in Python files. But after an update of a lot of of my packages it doesn&#x27;t seem to work anymore.
 I can enable it without error messagges but the whitespaces are still there. That behavior was different in the past.
 The rep on GitHub seems to be dead. Last commit was 2020.
 Are you aware of a good and easy alternative?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using eglot and flymake behind it to get live syntax checking in my Python buffer.
 That is done very often and quickly; even while I&#x27;m typing which decrease the performance sometimes.
 Can I increase the time when flymake is invoked? e.g. only every 5 seconds. Or only after 3 sec of user idle. Or something like that?

                              <span>I came across it by chance somewhere in the documentation but haven&#x27;t seen it since.
 It is similar to the :after keyword in use-package.
 On a side note that README is too much on a single page.
 The topics need to be broken out into separate pages. In particular the comparison with the other packages doesn&#x27;t belong in it.
