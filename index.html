                              <span>Hello everyone, I have a question in emacs. 
 I am learning emacs (newbie). I read a pdf call Emacs Beginner&#x27;s HOWTO by Jeremy D. Zawodny. He said it look like ASCII sketch. 
 What version of emacs in this image? Thank you.

                              <span>Hey guys, the only way I can get rust-analyzer to check my code for issues is if I save my file. I noticed in JetBrains (specifically Pycharm) there is an option for on the fly analysis which checks the code as you type it which is really neat. 
 Does anyone know if that is possible with rust-analyzer?

                              <span>Bufferbin provies a &quot;Treemacs&quot;-like experience for buffers. It is unique from other packages in that:
 1) It is contained in a sidebar (versus traditional window), making its location deterministic (and customizable) whenever toggled.
 2) It allows the user to specify which window to use and prevents &quot;random&quot; windows from getting overwritten.
 I hope others find it helpful!

 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and eager to dive into the language. Initially, I followed the instructions on haskell.org to set up my Haskell environment (GHC, GHcup, Stack, Cabal) and used VS Code as my editor. However, I encountered several issues along the way and decided to start fresh.
 I came across an older post recommending this guide (https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/get-started/) for setting up Haskell. Is this guide still relevant and recommended for beginners?
 Additionally, I&#x27;d appreciate advice on choosing the right editor for Haskell development. Which editor or IDE would you recommend for a beginner like me?
 Thank you in advance for your insights and recommendations!

                              <span>In some distributed protocols, servers (actors) transition between different roles at different times, and accept different subset of messages depending on the role.
 Ideally, an actor should always hold a reference to another actor typed in such a way that it is impossible for it to send the wrong type of message (i.e., a message that the other cannot accept because it is in the wrong role).
 The inherent problem is that, like I said, an actor can change role over time, and so the subset of messages it accepts; thus, all other actors holding a reference to it would actually start to hold a wrongly typed reference.
 Specifically, I am thinking to Raft consensus algorithm, where (for example) a server in follower state would not accept an AppendEntriesResponse message, but it is going to be able to accept it as soon as it transitions to leader state. If the behaviors are parametrized with a Raft type that comprises all messages (including AppendEntriesResponse), then it is easy to wrongfully send an AppendEntries to a follower.
 Does Akka have a pattern for this?
 Does this pattern also apply to actors running in clusters? Does it apply to both types of communication (ask, tell)?
 I know that it is possible for an actor to explicitly ignore some messages, but I believe it can become a bit cumbersome and perhaps prone to errors. Moreover, it does not eliminate the issue that I described above.

I&#x27;d like for emacs to display that path in the minibuffer, similarly to the way having this in my .emacs file works:
 (defun display-startup-echo-area-message ()

 Is there any way to pass a string from the command line for emacs to display in the &quot;startup echo area&quot;?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Every few months I check the NEWS file for the master branch of Emacs to keep up with anything that&#x27;ll be useful to me. This time around, I discovered a built-in way to have a right-aligned modeline! (Added April 1, 2023.)
  
Modeline elements can now be right-aligned. Anything following the symbol &#x27;mode-line-format-right-align&#x27; in &#x27;mode-line-format&#x27; will be right-aligned. Exactly where it is right-aligned to is controlled by the new user option &#x27;mode-line-right-align-edge&#x27;.
  
Put simply, all modeline elements following mode-line-format-right-align are right-aligned (according to the mode-line-right-align-edge setting). My modeline looks like this:

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (eval-after-load &#x27;dired &#x27;(progn (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd &quot;c&quot;) &#x27;my-dired-create-file) (defun create-new-file (file-list) (defun exsitp-untitled-x (file-list cnt) (while (and (car file-list) (not (string&#x3D; (car file-list) (concat &quot;untitled&quot; (number-to-string cnt) &quot;.txt&quot;)))) (setq file-list (cdr file-list))) (car file-list))
  (defun exsitp-untitled (file-list) (while (and (car file-list) (not (string&#x3D; (car file-list) &quot;untitled.txt&quot;))) (setq file-list (cdr file-list))) (car file-list)) (if (not (exsitp-untitled file-list)) &quot;untitled.txt&quot; (let ((cnt 2)) (while (exsitp-untitled-x file-list cnt) (setq cnt (1+ cnt))) (concat &quot;untitled&quot; (number-to-string cnt) &quot;.txt&quot;) ) ) ) (defun my-dired-create-file (file) (interactive (list (read-file-name &quot;Create file: &quot; (concat (dired-current-directory) (create-new-file (directory-files (dired-current-directory)))))) ) (write-region &quot;&quot; nil (expand-file-name file) t) (dired-add-file file) (revert-buffer) (dired-goto-file (expand-file-name file)) ) ) 
 ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 here. It does what I like, which is that pressing c will create a new file in dired mode, but what I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s by default named untitled.txt. For example, if I press c in dired with this inside ~/.emacs.d I get Create file: ~/.emacs.d/untitled.text, but what I want is Create file: ~/.emacs.d/ so I can pick the name myself. How can I accomplish this?
 I tried editing the code myself but it didn&#x27;t work as I expected. I&#x27;m not very familiar with Elisp.

                              <span>I export my org-roam notes to html, when I link other file (using org-roam, which uses [id: syntax), I get a long link like that https://domain/otherfile.html#ID-7f16f338-f545-4c4f-8628-73761e7fe346 that refers to the other file.
 The problem is that id is totally useless not only because I refer to the main heading (so domain/otherfile.html is equivalent) but also the html file does not contain any div with that ID, so even when I refer to a subheading instead of the file, the ID does not work. 
 Is there anyway to change this behaviour? I expect it to link to the file only (without ID), however, when a subheading is refered to instead of the main heading itself, then a working id should present.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.16 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This new version provides comprehensive tests for the C99 backend, and introduces a breaking change in the definition of the type Arg in copilot-language. For details, see [2]. The new version is already available on Hackage [4].
 As always, we&#x27;re releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Sep 7th, 2023.
 We are also extremely excited to announce that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-language and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].
 There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We&#x27;ll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

 Vscode will randomly stop showing analysis or completions on certain files until I restart it and sometimes files will just not work with it at all. I&#x27;m on Mac OS

                              <span>Lately, I&#x27;ve been playing with Lisp (Racket) for a different perspective, but the amount of things I&#x27;d have to implement from scratch to build systems with similar functionality to what I&#x27;m used to seems rather massive - and with much worse performance (both in container size and resource usage).
 Haskell seems to have the opposite problem: too many frameworks and options! Could someone suggest a roadmap of interesting frameworks/libraries which manage the complexity of modern web services with novel (compared to Go) paradigms?
 Starting with &quot;Learn you a Haskell&quot; seems good. But afterwards? I&#x27;ve seen books like &quot;Production Haskell&quot;, interesting examples by James Carlson, frameworks like Mu, Servant, Legion, (although Haskellers seem to shun frameworks like Gophers). I&#x27;m looking for the most &quot;different&quot; or &quot;paradigm shifting&quot; option to get me out of my comfort zone.

                              <span>Hi 
 Here’s getting started with Haskell using devenv.sh:
  
Pick from a wide range of GHC versions.
 Get stack/cabal as part of the dev environment.
 Get Haskell Language Server for the chosen GHC.
 Enable any linters/formatters as part of the hooks.
 mac/arm, mac/intel, linux/arm, linux/intel.
  
$ devenv shell
 …

 In the near future we plan to create nixpkgs-haskell, in similar style of nixpkgs-python, to expose all GHC minor versions released in the last years.

 If you&#x27;d like to be a moderator, please fill out this form, and we&#x27;ll get back to you! We&#x27;ll be looking for a group of people with an established Haskell-related posting history in a variety of time zones. Applications close at 23:59 on 13 July, 2023, AoE.
 We will announce the new moderators and formally transition moderation on 17 July, 2023.
 Thank you Taylor, for your ongoing stewardship amongst your other Haskell community contributions!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that Emacs seems to treat ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE as a word character. You can even see that if you do M-x describe-character:
  position: 4297 of 5814 (74%), column: 3 character: ﻿ (displayed as ﻿) (codepoint 65279, #o177377, #xfeff) charset: unicode (Unicode (ISO10646)) code point in charset: 0xFEFF script: arabic syntax: w which means: word to input: type &quot;C-x 8 RET feff&quot; or &quot;C-x 8 RET ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE&quot; buffer code: #xEF #xBB #xBF file code: #xEF #xBB #xBF (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Arial-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xBD9) 
 Consequently, spell-checkers see words with a no-break space after them as being misspelled.
 Maybe related too: if I have something like ~foo~---bar in org-mode, foo is correctly fontified as code. But if I use an em-dash like ~foo~—bar then foo is not fontified correctly. Is there some way to tell org-mode that — should be treated like a dash?

It&#x27;s really horrible for my workflow. How can I make all these re-use the same window ?

                              <span>The &quot;Start the Emacs Server&quot; section on EmacsWiki specifies two ways to start the server. I find that when I do it by adding (server-start) to my init.el, I get:
  $ emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; emacsclient: can&#x27;t find socket; have you started the server? emacsclient: To start the server in Emacs, type &quot;M-x server-start&quot;. emacsclient: error starting emacs daemon  I also tried M-x server-start inside an emacs session, and it succeeds, but then emacsclient fails the same as above.
 However, this works:  % emacs --daemon ‘epa-file’ already enabled Starting Emacs daemon. Restarting server $ emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; Waiting for Emacs...  and it works great, and it lets me even remove (server-start). My question is: what is going on, and do I need to fix anything? I&#x27;ve found that I can even remove (server-start) from my init.el at that point and it still works. Also, what does the epa-file mean?
 The weird part is I can&#x27;t even find the emacs --daemon when I use the ps -e command and I&#x27;m worried I have a few running around due to the server-start and not finding the socket.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement the following behaviour: 
 S-mouse-1 makes a selected region from the previous point to where I clicked
 Googling either suggests mouse-save-then-kill, which is not what I want or:
 (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;ignore) ; turn off font dialog (define-key global-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;mouse-set-point) (put &#x27;mouse-set-point &#x27;CUA &#x27;move) 
 which no longer works. I think the CUA property does not exist anymore, at least what this person found in cua-base.el is not there anymore.
 I&#x27;ve tried using mouse-set-region and mouse-drag-region but I cannot make it work (and I don&#x27;t think they are intended for something like that).
 Maybe I should define a function that does set-mark (or cua-set-mark since I&#x27;m using CUA) at the point and then does mouse-set-point? Even if this is the answer I don&#x27;t know how...
 What should I do?

                              <span>Hello emacsers, 
 I am using emacs explicitly inside a terminal (-nw). Do you have any modeline packages that don&#x27;t look terrible? I tried installing doom-modeline but there was no icon support (even after installing nerd-icons). Any suggestions are appreciated!
 Update: Figured it out. 1) As suggested by u/spudlgo I used use-package to install doom-modeline and run nerd-icons-install-font in emacs. This downloaded NFM.ttf in .local/share/fonts 2) Run fc-cashe -fv to update font cashe and then fc-list | grep .local/fonts . This makes a list of all the fonts in the directory. One needs to note down the name of desired font. 3) I opened dconf editor and searched for &#x27;fonts&#x27; under terminal folder. The terminal profiles are going to pop up. I copied the name of the font I wanted to the &#x27;font&#x27; bar. 4) change the terminal profiles and it&#x27;s done.
 Note that the changes need to be done in the local machine. I tested it after using ssh to connect to the server and icons appear as intended.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve had gpg pinned at 2.4.0 for quite a while on OSX since it broke EasyPG and this my encrypted journal etc.
 I noticed 2.4.3 just dropped. Has anyone tried it out yet to see if it fixes the problem with encryption?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wanting to move my global rectangle-mark-mode bindings over to a minor mode binding scenario so that I can free up some keys, though it didn&#x27;t go smoothly.
 I&#x27;ve tried using the alist that it may have but I get returned a bug saying it&#x27;s void:  (add-to-list &#x27;rectangle-mark-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;M-, ;&quot; . yank-rectangle) )  Though the hook works just fine as well as define-key for unbinding keys in the minor mode.  (defun rect-util-unbind() (define-key rectangle-mark-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-o&quot;) nil) ;; open-rectangle (define-key rectangle-mark-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-t&quot;) nil) ;; string-rectangle )   (add-hook &#x27;rectangle-mark-mode-hook &#x27;rect-util-unbind )  I checked out the Emacs manual for minor mode alist but I wasn&#x27;t able to really follow. I also did some searching around but there wasn&#x27;t much helpful information relating to this problem that I could find. Does rectangle-mark-mode even have an alist? Am I able to make one if it doesn&#x27;t exist (would like to try this out for any other modes where I may have to do this or something)?

                              <span>I&#x27;m building Emacs for myself, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out if I should build it with ImageMagick or not. I understand that as of Emacs 27, it&#x27;s no longer used by default in favor of some built-in image manipulation routines. I also understand that historically ImageMagick has been prone to various security vulnerabilities which has been a headache for Emacs users and maintainers.
 I&#x27;m not worried about future security vulnerabilities, what I&#x27;m interested in is powerful functionality, which I know that ImageMagick is known for. For those of you who build your own Emacs binaries, do you build it with ImageMagick? What&#x27;s your use-case and reasoning for doing so, or for not doing so?
 Interested in hearing any thoughts about ImageMagic in Emacs, legacy, history, the good, the bad, etc.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I recently just moved to vanilla gnu/emacs from doom/emacs and one of the things I miss the most is the doom/open-scratch-buffer function where doom just opens a minibuffer instead of moving you to a whole different scratch buffer, anyone know how to replicate this or if theres a package out there already. Thanks.

                              <span>In my current semester in school we learnt basic scala and very basic scalafx. Now for our final project we are expected to code a game like chess or a 2d shooter to get distinction 🫠 
 What libraries should I use to do this? Stick with scala fx? Also what are some good resources to learn how to complete this project? On YouTube and Google I only found a snake game. 
 I have some experience with PyGame if there is anything similar here could someone point me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hi, I am new to the eamcs and orgmode in general but i know that you can extend link types. But i don&#x27;t know enough to implement it myself. 
 Does anybody have a script that uses id&#x27;s for linking between two files and after id use an internal link.
 For example
  [[id:b7b07a14-5dbb-48ed-9d9d-70df49e83231:a heading][Heading]] 
 Here a heading won&#x27;t work because its not supported method by default. 
 If anybody has a script that works on these type of links please share it with me.

                              <span>I need to convert an HTML table to the ASCII table format, but not the org-mode table, because the tables I&#x27;m dealing with have colspans and rowspans. I suppose I can convert them into the table.el format since the tables would be used in a read-only buffer.
 Does anyone know an elisp function that converts either HTML or shr-dom structure to a table.el table? I can probably try to write my own, but having to deal with all those spans makes me feel it&#x27;ll be a bit tricky. I bet someone already solved that problem.

Is it possible to do this with the native emacs-lisp functionality?
 I&#x27;ve only found the &#x60;--batch&#x60; approach, but I&#x27;m not quite sure how to make it work with my distributed package

env-commander-mode is a simple mode which allows any shell commands that Emacs invokes to run one or more commands beforehand to initialize the shell environment. There are many Emacs packages which can configure process environments, for example, direnv, but they lack the ability to go a step further and define shell functions and aliases, which is often required by &quot;virtual environment&quot; tools. For those who prefer interacting with shell commands via shell-command rather than shell, eshell, or term, env-commander-mode is here to assist.
  
If you are a fellow shell-command enjoyer, you may also be interested in shell-command-x.el which I posted about recently.

                              <span>For everyone who uses Emacs as a text editor: how do you get text completion in your buffers? (completion-at-point, not completing-read which is minibuffer completion)
 I&#x27;ve been trying to set it up in a way that is comfortable for me, but as with many things on Emacs, it is easy to get overwhelmed.
  
Bindings: you can choose to have a dedicated keybindings (By default M-TAB or C-M-i on the common major modes) or set tab-always-indent to &#x27;complete in order to make TAB have a double function: either complete or indent if there&#x27;s nothing to complete. 
 I sometimes do also use TAB to collapse code using outline-minor-mode, that would make it have a triple use
 
  Display and select completion candidates: you can either use *Completions* or some packages like corfu, company, auto-complete to …</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 lately when I am coding I get annoyedd by the autocompletion popping up. Mostly it is just visual noise and it essentially does not interfere with typing, but combined with copilot it just becomes a noisy kindergarten. I was wondering if there are others out there with similar concerns and how you would tackle this ? 
 I have rebound my tab to company-completion for while, but I found it to be a bit uneven, for instance you´&#x27;d get nothing if no completion was found, making you doubt if it was working at all. Also, since then I have moved to vertico and from what I gather its completion trigger is organised differently and it also does not solve my copilot issue. 
 The reason for this post is that all info on completion is about automating all the tings and shower you with info while doing the dev, b/c we want to be vscode so much. 
 Instead I was looking for some inspiration regarding a different paradigm, an on-demand approach with the option to get more info on the class/function/type, or in the case of copilot, a snippet.
 thx.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using eglot + pylsp to edit Python files. Most of the time it works fine, but occasionally (frequently enough to be very annoying, but infrequently enough to be hard to reproduce!) it seems to get &quot;out of sync&quot;, and I get a bunch of random errors that don&#x27;t match the file I&#x27;m editing.
 For example, I&#x27;m currently editing a file that has no genuine errors or problems, but flymake-show-buffer-diagnostic reports 1 error [&quot;unmatched &#x27;)&#x27;&quot;] and 30 warnings (indentation errors, &quot;unexpected spaces around keyword&quot;, etc.).
 Saving the file makes no difference.
 C-x C-v reloads the file and the errors disappear. Running eglot-reconnect also fixes the errors.
 eglots-events-buffer is a bit hard to interpret but it looks like at least some of the spurious errors are being received from pylsp.
 I don&#x27;t know how to track down this problem as I don&#x27;t know which component has the problem. Presuambly it&#x27;s not flymake, but is Eglot sending the wrong file data? pylsp reporting the wrong thing? Some kind of JSON RPC issue? Something else I&#x27;m missing?
 Any tips on how to track down the issue?
 My eglot config is minimal:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (use-package eglot
 :ensure t
 :defer t
 :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure)
 :bind ((&quot;C-c r&quot; . eglot-rename)
 (&quot;C-c C-r&quot; . eglot-rename))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m running
 emacs 28.1 (same problem occurs with 29)
 pylsp v1.7.4

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m using emacs as a systemd service (as described in https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#h5o-2), with the emacs.service file that comes with the emacs sources. All was working well in debian 11, but since I upgraded to the new stable the graphical emacsclient isn&#x27;t able to connect to the daemon, I suspect because the daemon is started before gnome session. If I restart the systemd service it works, but not the first time I log in into gnome.
 I see that there is a solution to this (or similar) problem for KDE users in https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#h5o-17 but my tentatives to replicate it for gnome were not succesful.
 Anyone knows how to fix this?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Recently I found good use in the EditGPT App which can helps tracking/editing changes. Basically, you instruct ChatGPT to &quot;Proofread the following text&quot; and can accept/decline the suggested changes. Any idea on how one could do this in Emacs? In particular, the part where the diff of two texts is created, and an interactive editing of the resulting changes is possible. The creation of the improved texts can simply be done using any of the LLM APIs.

                              <span>I compiled Emacs from source using:
 $ sudo apt install autoconf make gcc libgtk-3-dev libgccjit-12-dev \ libxpm-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev \ libgnutls28-dev libncurses-dev libjansson-dev $ wget http://mirrors.nav.ro/gnu/emacs/emacs-28.2.tar.xz $ tar xfv emacs-28.2.tar.xz $ cd emacs-28.2 $ ./configure --without-compress-install --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-mailutils $ make $ sudo make install 
 Everything is functioning properly except for when I attempt to open feeds in Elfeed; in that case, the following message is displayed:
 Elfeed: libxml2 functionality is unavailable 
 I tried rebuilding emacs but the --with-libxml2 or --with-libxml option is not recognized as a valid compilation flag. I also tried installing libmxl2 and libxml2-dev packages on my Debian system via APT but same issue.
 Do you have any idea which compilation flag I might have missed that could include the libxml2 library?

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m using eglot this days (moved from lsp-mode) and I&#x27;m having some issues when doing C++ (clangd). 
 I can&#x27;t really explain the issue but will love any input. The problem is that eglot works but I have to constantly keep doing eglot-reconnect because somehow the session is lost. When I say constantly I mean like every minute (or less) when I&#x27;m in the middle of writing C++ code. I&#x27;m also using corfu (instead of company-mode), not sure if that changes anything.
 Below is my current configuration in case I&#x27;m doing anything wrong, along with the clangd version I&#x27;m using:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; clangd --version Debian clangd version 14.0.6 Features: linux+grpc Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

                              <span>Hi, Maybe what I am asking already exists, maybe not.
 I want to create todos from roam notes. But since I do not want to add all my roam notes to the org-agenda, I refile my todos, which is alright so far.
 My capture template includes the mention of the original file and block where I was working as I created the todo, so I know from the agenda side where the todo comes from.
 But how shall I know from the roam note that a TODO has been created from there and what its state is (waiting, next...).
 Are there kind of backlinks for Todos in roam?
 Thanks for your help

                              <span>OK, so, once more, I am back to Emacs. This time, the main reason is that I am using a Mac as the new work computer and I can&#x27;t stand window management, so having as much as I can managed by Emacs makes more and more sense.
 I am using Spacemacs and I am struggling with a couple of things:
  
Perspectives. In theory, I should be able to open a new window (frame, I knwo) with a brand new perspective but I can&#x27;t find the option for that. My Google-fu is failing me on this. If not, I am happy just being able to open a new blank perspective on the same Window and assigning it a shortcut. I can then use perspective switching to move between them.
 
I don&#x27;t seem to be able to install multi-vterm. If I do package-install, it does not appear to be available. I like having multiple terminals and would like them all inside of Emacs. What am I missing? I am using the default config, with melpa enabled.
 
 Thanks

 The command i tried is flymake-show-project-diagnostics, but that shows me only the diagnostics from files I&#x27;ve visited. I want to see the diagnostics from all files in the project. 
 p.s. I&#x27;m noob, I don&#x27;t know LISP, but I&#x27;ll learn soon, currently just trying to get used to emacs :)

 Alternatively, how do I bind C-x and C-c like cua does, manually? I tried binding them using selected.el but that didn’t work

How does it go? I know it&#x27;s quite popular for Vi and it&#x27;s derivatives. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a VSCode muggle trying my best to learn emacs. For the last three weeks I&#x27;ve done the tutorial and then read up some information on keybinds to try and info pages to read. While my muscle memory is improving, I still have the strong urge to use the trackpad to navigate. I don&#x27;t do well with the control keybinds especially on my thinkpad laptop. I also often fat-finger the super key which throws me out of focus.
 Its terribly frustrating but I soldier on in the desire to reach nirvana. Please send me your emacs energy and any tips you have for training myself using a default emacs on either linux (fedora) or windows (11). I use them both on a daily basis.

                              <span>So, for a class project we are able to freely choose a programming language for translating a scheduling problem into CNF and pass it to a SAT solver. I love haskell, my partner loves C#, so Scala seemed like the perfect fit for both of us. 
 Thus, I began modeling my boolean algebra as: 
  sealed trait Algebra[A] case class VariableTerm[A](varT : A) extends Algebra[A] case class Negate[A](neg : Algebra[A]) extends Algebra[A] case class And[A](_1 : Algebra[A], _2 : Algebra[A]) extends Algebra[A] case class Or[A] (_1 : Algebra[A], _2 : Algebra[A]) extends Algebra[A]

                              <span>I&#x27;m using org-roam for PKM, and it&#x27;s working quite well, except that inserting a link to a node with org-roam-node-insert (SPC n r i in doom) only uses a small part of the screen width, which makes it much harder than necessary to pick a node, especially when there are several with similar names. Any idea how to get it to use the full screen width?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Meta recently announced they have made Buck2 open-source.
Buck2 is a from-scratch rewrite of Buck, a
polyglot, monorepo build system that was developed and used at Meta (Facebook),
and shares a few similarities with Bazel.
As you may know, the Scalable Builds Group at Tweag
has a strong interest in such scalable build systems.
We were thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Meta on Buck2
to help make the tool useful and successful in the open-source use case.
We also have a strong focus and
a lot of experience with the Bazel build system.
To connect the two
I will give an overview of how Buck2 differs from Bazel.

High-Level Differences
Buck2 is a fresh rewrite in Rust.

 Emacs behaves perfectly well with full opacity, but flickers and produces static-like artifacts when transparency is enabled, especially when typing or scrolling. It seems less pronounced when the window emacs is stacked on top of is mostly a flat color. 
 I was using emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin 28.2. I tried building emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git 29.0 to no change. 
 So far, it is the only application with this issue. Oddly enough, this happens even with full opacity on Sway.

 Is there a package that is supposed to tag along with Emacs?

                              <span>I used to have GPG configured in a way that it just worked. At some point, after something was updated, it stopped functioning as it used to. I realized that after a reboot, it no longer retains its state. Now, every time I open Emacs anew, after the computer reboot, I have to manually open ~/.authinfo.gpg, then it would ask me for the password, and if I enter the correct one, it works. Until the next reboot. Now, I think, I prefer it this way. But it bothers me that after a reboot, the first task I have to do is attempt to open an encrypted file to trigger a prompt. I have two questions with all that:
  
Why does it now require the password and not store it between the reboots (as it used to)? I don&#x27;t think this is Emacs doing. Probably some gpg.conf setting.
 
How can I initiate the prompt in Emacs without having to open an encrypted file?

                              <span>Hello, this is my first attempt at creating Emacs tool.
 clang-formatter provides a function for formatting the current buffer using clang-format. It&#x27;s not a mode, but I limit modes to only languages that are supported by clang-format (C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Protobuf/C#). It also make it easy to customize formatting style from local variable (.dir-locals.el). 
 Some part of the code is inspired by gofmt function from go-mode.

                              <span>Hi people, 
 I saw quite some versions of creating a Zettelkasten in Emacs using Org and one implementation of Building a Second Brain in Org. So, I would be really curious how one would merge both in org. I wrote an article on theory and practical method on how to combine those two methods: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten/
 From experience, solutions in org ooze a great deal of creativity. So, if anyone wants to combine these methods, I will be happy to assist, in part to satisfy my curiosity.
 Live long and prosper Sascha

                              <span>Hi, I bought a galaxy book 3 ultra, which comes with a 2880x1800 display with 120hz. I am having a hard time to use github.com/vedang/pdf-tools with it. Sometimes it works fine, but most of the time the scrolling of pdfs gets really slow. If I change the resolution to 1920x1200 it gets back to normal and scrolls smothly. When I use the builtin doc-view instead of pdf-tools it works fine. I tried running both on xorg and wayland and got the same result. Also, I tried running on a fresh emacs installation with the only package being pdf-tools, and the issue is still there. Does anybody experienced something similar? I am using emacs 27.1 on PopOS 22.04.

                              <span>I usually open Emacs split horizontally, with two buffers side by side. When the left-hand window is active and I open calc by using m-x calc, the calc interface opens on the right-hand side, underneath the window. Would it be possible to somehow specify that calc opens on the left-hand side, underneath the existing window?

 💭 Why?
 I was never satisfied with any theme nor any fonts, some or the other time, always felt to have a change.
 For long duration I was settled on modus-vivendi only, other than that I liked cattpuccin and doom-gruvbox, the later two lacked some face highlights in some mode (info, eww.. ). But modus is obvious masterpiece.
 This is emacs, so obviously I want to modify if something bother me.
 As a result, I finally started making a theme that felt fine to me. (I say fine because, I don&#x27;t think it is complete or perfect)
 📜 Info
 There is no science or principle behind this theme. Just some colors lying on your screen. If many of you do not like it, i might tweak and change some colors for community purpose. Or else, i might improve and add some goodies.
 Screenshots are here: https://github.com/idlip/haki/blob/haki/gallery.org
 As of now, I dont plan on making light theme, I&#x27;m not a light theme user. But if many want light variant, I might take it up in near future.
 ⭐ Features
  
Usually in themes, background of mark region, completion bar gets noticed. So i made haki-change-region, which changes region color in many places on the fly.
 There are variables like haki-*-font, which has respective use cases to look good in org, markdown, elfeed.
 Also for meow or evil users, you can use haki-modal-mode-line which changes the mode-line border color accordingly to states.
  
Too long, Don&#x27;t wanna read;

 It is available in melpa!

As a side note, I manage my whole system (nixos) and emacs in literate org-mode and it has been great. Check here: https://github.com/idlip/d-nix

 It happens not infrequently midsession, that when I run dap-java-run-test-method, I am presented with a dap-server-log buffer, which says at the top:
 Error parsing command-line arguments: Expected parameter for option &#x27;--class-path&#x27; but found &#x27;-m&#x27; 
 M-x lsp-restart-workspace or just M-x lsp have no effect on this. Short of restarting Emacs I can&#x27;t get it working again. Does anyone have any advice?

                              <span>Hi,
 Im basically using 2 versions of Emacs. 28 and 23, one on WIndows. The short story is that, the company Im working for uses Windows and a specific GIS software that ONLY can works with 23 (unless I do more research with the incredibly scant documentation on this unusual setup). Im okay with it so far, coz I havent dont any proper training, and Emacs isnt the main focus. And I managed to improve and learn a lot by doing some manual loading of eLisp files in Emacs 23.
 ​
 My main question, which fonts do you all prefer? Any arguments/reasons for it? Im using Julia Mono on the companies, and Source Code Pro on my personal setup. I find Source Code Pro to be more pleasant.
 Oh, one last thing, the Emacs on my Windows appears &quot;less sharp/low res&quot;. Though it could just be a trick of the eye.

                              <span>So the context is: Cats-effect or any m:n scheduler, Node, and Kube
 When working with NodeJs on a machine with multiple cores you are forced to spawn multiple Node processes to utilize it. With Kube though, there is no reason to do so. Instead of giving a single process 8 cores you spawn 8 pods with cpu:1.
 My question is - how much of a reason do I have to give my cats-effect app 8 core vs spawning 8 instances?
 And also how much of a bottleneck is the process of serialization with cats services trying to do a lot of concurrent IO aka web servers? It&#x27;s anecdotal since I was not there but at work, it was observed that NodeJs is dying very fast under the pressure of grpc encoding/decoding. But it seemed to me to be a mistaken judgment since it should be the same in cats/tokio/what-have-you so I think it was just easier for them to ramp up those core numbers with scala.

                              <span>I need to make a big compliment @ctietze!
I am always testing other pieces of software to improve my coaching, since not everybody uses The Archive. But whenever I start to use other apps, I am put off by their stutters and bugs. I think I report once every six months that something is off.
I started to use Apple Notes for collaboration (family stuff, with Christian, for a Podcast etc.). If I imagine that there are teams behind Apple Notes while Christian is 100% on its own, just with nagging me as a support, I am baffled.
In some way, I have the blessing to experience The Archive as a user with the most intimate user support possible. I have very high requirements for the software that I use to access my Zettelkasten because my work is very intense (after 6 hours of work I am often soaked in sweet). The software needs to get out of my way. The Archive is almost invisible to me now, almost like air. And similar to air, The Archive provides a vital foundation for me functioning.
So: Very good, @ctietze !</span>

                              <span>I would like to color comments differently, to pick an example (C/C++).
 These 4 comments could all have different faces.
 // Single line comment. /** Doxygen. */ /* disabled code. */ /* * Comment block. */ 
 I have some local configuration that can do this, but it seems like it could be made into a small package (possibly with string support too).
 e.g. 
 (setq my-custom-faces &#x27;((:type comment :match-literal &quot;/**&quot; :face font-lock-doc-face) (:type comment :match-regex &quot;//[:blank:]&quot; :face font-lock-doc-markup-face))) 
 Does something like this exist, or is it worth writing a new package?

                              <span>The VC system in Emacs supports a bunch of version control systems including old ones like RCS and new ones like Git and Mercurial.
 Is it possible to write a package to add support for another version control system? At work I use a version control system that&#x27;s not supported by VC.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that VC has emacs lisp code for each system (&quot;vc-git.el&quot;, &quot;vc-hg.el&quot;, &quot;vc-cvs.el&quot;, and so on). Is all that&#x27;s needed to write one of these? Or is there code in other parts (like vc.el) that is specific to the system. I notice that vc-src.el is very simple. So, I&#x27;m suspicious that there may be code in other places.

                              <span>GPT-4 is completely confused and going in circles, I can&#x27;t get a good explanation out of it.
 My situation is this: I was trying to define a sum type whose branches had some fields in common. Ultimately, this is what works:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;purescript type GraduatedFields r &#x3D; ( graduatedMax :: Number , graduatedMin :: Number | r )
 type GridFields r &#x3D; ( gridCellSize :: Size , gridOrigin :: Point | r )
 type HorizontalFields r &#x3D; ( isOpposite :: Boolean | r )
 type CommonPanel a &#x3D; { alignmentFocusName :: String , data :: Record () | a }
 data Panel r &#x3D; Graduated (CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r)) | Grid (CommonPanel (GridFields r)) | Horizontal (CommonPanel (HorizontalFields r))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But if I simply switch the () to {} (which I thought was the same thing) for GraduatedFields, for instance, this no longer compiles:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Could not match kind
 Type 
 with kind
 Row Type 
 while checking that type GraduatedFields r has kind Row Type while inferring the kind of CommonPanel (GraduatedFields r) in type constructor Panel &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Why is this the case? What is the subtle difference between these two?

                              <span>Adding an update on my last post. 
 Since I announced consult-gh, we have now added some more features, including support for opening issues in magit/forge and create/edit posts from the forge buffer. This allows you to visit issues of any repo in an ad-hoc fashion and with an intuitive UI, eliminating the need to opening GitHub in a browser. 
 As mentioned in the last post, this can improve your GitHub workflow and now with forge integration will even make it more efficient and intuitive than before. Especially for repositories that you don&#x27;t actively want to contribute to (so o cloning, no contribution, ...), this can simplify your magit/forge workflow.

 This week, I ran a poll on my Mastodon to see who uses Vanilla Keybindings vs Modal. As a Meow user since a year, I was curious. Given the results (hugely in favor of Vanilla), I decided to go back to trying Vanilla. And I&#x27;m really loving it. I feel like I&#x27;m actually faster in a way. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I prefer it over modal. Then again, I&#x27;m not a coder so I think maybe the reason that coders like modal is maybe it fits their typing/editing patterns better? I&#x27;m not sure.
 Anyway, as I said: I love Emacs and Vanilla keybindings. Except, as we all know, Emacs can be a bit of a relic. And sometimes, it&#x27;s like the people in charge refuse to even acknowledge that the world has …</span>

                              <span>This question is not about how one could resize the window after it is made but how one could set the size when it will split.
 Some hacky methods I&#x27;ve seen involved a keybinding bound to a chain of resizing keystrokes. I wondered if there is a better way of achieving the same thing. Like how when you use tmm-menubar, when it opens, it doesn&#x27;t do a 50/50 split but instead was more like 70/30 (I&#x27;ll leave a picture in the comments for reference).

I have been looking through the makefiles and configure scripts and did a web search but I am not finding what is the problem. Any suggestion, is it some setting on msys2/mingw side, or something in Emacs build scripts, if anyone has bumped into this?

 I tried running an app in Windows&#x27;s Program Files with M-x term and basically I can&#x27;t figure out how to do the autocomplete for the space.
 I tried escaping it with &#x27;\&#x27; and just inputting it as is &#x27; &#x27; but neither seems to work.
 There must be a trivial solution for this.

 My understanding is C-J should pass what I typed as is, but that just submits the fuzzy match as well.

 Can be used as-is by setting only a handful of (including zero) parameters. Ideal for users looking to &#x27;try emacs&#x27;.
 Provide a carefully crafted set of keybindings using evil (pure emacs experience also possible).
  
Finally, here are some new features available in v0.2:
  
Module-based architecture, providing an excellent springboard for writing your own modules or tweaking existing ones.
 A project-based programming workflow using emacs-native tab- and project-management tools.
 LSP using the now built-in eglot.jl
  
And many, many more. A detailed CHANGELOG (v0.2 ← v0.1) available here.
 Give it a go! All user feedback and contributions are welcome.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been using org mode to store web bookmarks. I&#x27;d like to keep track of files using org mode, too.
 My goal is to have headlines to act as some sort of &quot;abstraction&quot; over my heterogeneous collection of bookmarks + local files. I can tag them, sort them, reference them (through ids), annotate them in the same way (despite web bookmarks and local files being so different).
 The idea is to just use attachments: attachments do use the usual ID property, the data dir is global (~/data). Inheritance for attachment is off for the sake of simplicity and to avoid problems when refiling.
 Whenever I want to index a file I just use org capture, i specify a file path (or file on point if using dired) and it automatically creates creates a headline with the file attached (moved) in it. 
 The only difficulty i see so far is to make org attach a file during a capture. It looks feasible, though.
 Does anyone here a similar workflow? I&#x27;d like to read advices or some experiences in this regard

 As a practice I&#x27;ve written a CLI app but now I&#x27;d like to move it to some GUI like ScalaFX.
 How would you approach this? I don&#x27;t want to assign unsafe runs to buttons, there must be a better way to create a ZIO which deploys the GUI in the end.

                              <span>Hi folks,
Am new at this and getting ready to plow into a physical version of a Zettelkasten. I haven&#x27;t had much luck finding examples of how reference/bibliographic cards are numbered or referred to ? Since they&#x27;re generally kept in a separate  slip box, how are they numbered? Do they branch out too (i.e. 1a2b) or no ?
Would love to hear or see some examples.
Thanks!

I&#x27;d like my ZK to receive &quot;notions&quot; (&#x3D; definitions of concepts) and &quot;facts&quot; (&#x3D; proven pieces of information) as well, but it seems this approach is not exactly what the ZK is about for most users. Am I wrong?</span>

                              <span>Hello tout le monde,
 I (quite) recently wrote an extension (called by the name &quot;Aby&quot;) for our beloved Emacs which is capable of dynamically handle (code/text/you name it…) snippets within your buffers. *Aby* is extensible via Elisp and thus pretty versatile. I&#x27;d be glad if you&#x27;d find some use in this work. A minor package-version is pending, but -- as of now -- Aby is working fine under the current circumstances. The (ROBOdoc) code documentation will give you some more insight on how it works: https://code.rubenphilipp.com/aby/
 Here you&#x27;ll find the repository: https://github.com/rubenphilipp/aby

                              <span>I use vertico and am wanting to interactively change the current sorting of the offered completion candidates with hotkeys. The &quot;interactively sort&quot; part is critical because I don’t want to recreate the list of candidates, as often that would require re-calling the original command that brought up the minibuffer in order to get the right candidates.
 I know you can customize consult--read to sort the originally displayed candidates, but what about changing the sort of the already-displayed candidates? Might embark-become offer a solution?
 Thanks so much for any help!

 Dirvish with media-progress-dirvish package
 media-progress-dirvish and media-progress-dired packages displays position where you stopped watching video file in emacs&#x27;s file manager buffer. Under the hood it extracts this data from media player (currently mpv only, but I suppose vlc support is also possible). Both packages available on MELPA. Hope this package will be useful for community! Any feedback highly appreciated!

                              <span>I like to log everything in log.org, and I like for it to show up in the Org Agenda buffer. I often stay up past midnight playing video games, so I often have log items that look like:
 * DONE Play video games :gaming: CLOSED: [2023-06-30 Fri 23:15]--[2023-07-01 Sat 03:30] 
 When I do this, it stops showing up in the Org Agenda buffer completely.
 I&#x27;d like for it to show:
  
from START time to 24:00 or whatever on the first day
 from 00:00 to END time on the second day
 if there is a multiple day span, I&#x27;d like it to say ALL DAY 00:00-24:00
  
How can I achieve this?

 Lspce is a simple lsp client for Emacs, it only supports a small set of LSP features ( and I don&#x27;t want to add more ATM), but for the last year, it was my main lsp client and it worked well, so maybe it&#x27;s useful for others too.
 The highest priority of it is not to freeze Emacs, I cannot say I have achieved this goal, but I think it&#x27;s in a good shape in terms of this.
 It&#x27;s implemented as a module with Rust. It takes advantages of threads and caches results from lsp server to reduce Emacs&#x27;s burdens.
 Its code ( especially the elisp code) needs some more improvements, and bugs are expected. You&#x27;re warned :)
 You can find more details in the README. Enjoy it!

                              <span>How do (Scala 3) trait parameters interact with parameters of classes that extend the trait?
 I thought I wanted to write something like this:  trait ExampleTrait(val param: Int) case class Class(override val param: Int) extends ExampleTrait(param) val x &#x3D; (Class(1): ExampleTrait).param  However, the compiler rejects the class line, saying:  ... error overriding value param in trait ExampleTrait of type Int; value param of type Int cannot override val parameter value param in trait ExampleTrait 
 I&#x27;m not clear on why that &quot;value param of type Int cannot override val parameter value param in trait ExampleTrait&quot;.
 I tried several variations (e.g., no var on trait parameter, no override on class parameter, no val on class parameter), but nothing I tried that still had the trait parameter and had a class parameter with the same name worked. (Using different parameter names worked, but they&#x27;re logically the same thing, so I want to keep the names identical.)
 Of course, I can do it without trait parameters, as in:  trait ExampleTrait { def param: Int } case class Class(override val param: Int) extends ExampleTrait val x &#x3D; (Class(1): ExampleTrait).param 
 However, I thought maybe that would be doable using trait parameters.
 (No, it&#x27;s not essential that I use a trait parameter. However, I&#x27;m also trying to learn Scala 3, so I&#x27;d like to understand what&#x27;s going on and what the rules are, and whether trying use a trait parameter makes sense for my use case.)
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey folks,
 Khoj has added a bunch of features since my first announcement, so thought of sharing updates here in case you folks want to try it out and give feedback.
 Demo
 Uses Khoj to Search, Chat with the Khoj Github repository from Emacs
 Feature updates
  
Unified Search: Fast search across all (text) content types from a single interface
 Simplified setup 
 Installing Khoj on Emacs will automatically install the server if you have python, pip installed
 Khoj now works with python 3.11. So search is 25% faster and works with the default installed python on most operating systems
 We&#x27;ve started onboarding folks to Khoj cloud. Get on the invite list if you&#x27;re interested in using Khoj AI on your phone and other devices (or don&#x27;t want to self-host Khoj)
 
 You can quickly test out Khoj on the FAQ page. It&#x27;ll let you search and chat with the Khoj Github repository 
 Khoj can now index issues, commit messages and docs from any Github repository
 
  
Quickstart
 Install Khoj from MELPA and call M-x khoj to run it
 See khoj.el setup instructions for more details or just ask Khoj on the FAQ webpage

                              <span>Most of you pros already know this, but it just struck me watching 0006 | Setting Up a Scholarly Writing Environment With Markdown, VSCodium, and pandoc - YouTube that I&#x27;ve been doing it all wrong.
I&#x27;ve placed my footnotes at the end of the note, below the ## References section. This is a problem with pandoc processing. Footnotes need to be above the label for the citations. A small thing and not a problem if you are not ever going to export a note using pandoc, but if you are an active scientist or academic, you will. I suggest we get in the habit and put footnotes above the citations label.
Even better still, I&#x27;m going to get in the habit of placing the footnote in line with the text. Pandoc will move it appropriately on conversion.</span>

1) Which tool is your main Office application for generating long-form text (including Table of Contents, Citation, advanced references, etc...)?

                              <span>Hi Zettlers,
some of you might be already aware of setting your smartphone to greyscale to reduce its appeal and temper its poisonous influence.
I did something similar on my laptop: I created a whitelist via LeechBlock for Firefox. So, everything is grey and boring except for this site and my site on health and fitness.
After reading Dopamin Nation by Anna Lembke I refocused on setting up a low-dopaminergic environment.
So far, I really like that I like the internet less.
Live long and prosper

 I&#x27;ve written a simple package to help me install packages. Maybe you&#x27;ll like it too. So I make this post. 
 I copy some description from the README ( read README in the repo for more details)
 Introduction
 Pie is a very simple Package Installer for Emacs.
 I used to use package.el
 (and elpa/melpa etc.), but it has some drawbacks IMO, including:
  
A single repository may be split into several packages. Some people like it, but not including me.
 It does not support optional dependencies.
  
I’ve only tested/used it on Linux, maybe there are some problems on Windows and/or Mac.
 Features
 Pie supports the following features:
  
Support cloning a repository or downloading files (e.g. from emacswiki) directly.
 Support cloning a particular branch/tag/commit
 Support git’s shadow clone
 Support customized building logic
 Support specifying dependencies according to your actual needs
 Support generating autoloads files and loading it

                              <span>In this comment, 00-11 suggested that I ask this as a new thread, &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot;. So here is my question:
 There are many long-time users here who&#x27;ve been using Emacs for many years. In all these years, how well do you think Emacs has evolved? Are there some things that you think Emacs did very well in these years? Are there areas where Emacs did not do so well?

                              <span>Hi, I have been trying to use Emacs for my Rust development, and am attempting to use Org Mode to organise my code and add additional notes to it. I have set up the rust-analyzer to work in a normal .rs file, with inlay hints and everything, however, I&#x27;m unable to get the same behaviour in the Org Mode source blocks, and get the error in the pic instead. I am using lsp-org and polymode in Org Mode. Can you help me to troubleshoot this please?

 I&#x27;ll be happy to provide any additional information required for you guys to assist me in my woes.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Basically, I want to write a program that constructs elisp to interpret and work on headless buffers, etc to accomplish a task I have in mind.
 I imagine it might be possible to use emacs client to execute elisp with the shell wrapped in my language of choice, but I was wondering if there was an API specification for the tcp server or any existing implementations.

 Hello /r/emacs,
 shell-command-x.el is a package I wrote to improve the experience of using shell-command and async-shell-command without straying too far from the behavior of vanilla Emacs. Its primary features are:
  
The names of process buffers can be customized on a per-command basis; for example, the buffer name for the command ls -la can be automatically set to *shell:ls*, *shell:ls -la*, or any other number of desired values.
 
When a command completes, its output buffer can emulate special-mode; this is useful for quickly dismissing (with quit-window) or quickly re-running the command (with revert-buffer).
 
When a command completes, the point can be moved to the beginning of the output buffer if the command wasn&#x27;t interactive; this is useful for paging through the output of commands like grep --help.
 
 The project readme also contains some tips and tricks for a smoother experience. The goal of the package is essentially to make shell buffers display when and where you want them, depending on the kinds of commands you run, and for those buffers to behave more like native special emacs buffers like help-mode.

                              <span>So my post isn&#x27;t meant to bash on Magit, but rather I am trying to understand what kind of issues people had with the git CLI that made them love Magit. 
 I remember before entering the world of emacs, people would say the two packages that would change your life would be Magit and org-mode. I have been using emacs for a few months now and I can safely say that I never use org-mode and still use the git CLI as I find it faster. Really the package that I felt was unique and made me stick with emacs was Tramp. The ability to open a remote file in an instant, with no subscription fee (looking at you Jetbrains) and without it interfering with my workflow was amazing.
 Now I am a young adult (~26yr) and am still early in my career as a software engineer so maybe I am just ignorant, but really the only git commands I use are git diff, status, pull, push branch and merge. And honestly in my bubble of using git, Magit is not really that much different than just using the CLI. Heck in the terminal I can even create aliases and chain commands with &amp;&amp; which is even faster.
 Are there git commands that I don&#x27;t know about that feel horrible or are the projects and responsibilities I deal with still small enough that I do not see the downfalls of using the CLI for much larger projects?
 TLDR: What aspects of Magit make it a better experience for version control than just using git in the terminal?
 EDIT: I want to thank each and everyone that replied. It seems that the way I commit code (multiple files at a time) is super elementary and for better debugging and readability people actually commit specific LINES of code not even files, which Magit in unmatched for. I learned a lot of new tools in this post specifically ediff and git bisect which I had not heard off. I plan to take these lessons forward in my career. I apologize if was not able to reply to everyone but I do promise I read your message. Thanks again.

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m trying to get a maybe unusual configuration work with eglot + clangd + projectile (or maybe project.el, any would be fine really)
 My projects are organized roughly like this:
 common project_a/.projectile project_b/.projectile project_c/.projectile 
 All dirs are git repos and common is shared between the three projects. Inside the .projectile files there is a +/../common line to include the common dir when looking for project files.
 The three project dirs include a compile_commands.json that also knows how to compile files in the common dir.
 Each project may set different defines or compiler flags to compile common code.
 Now I have two problems:
 - if I open a file inside project_a and then try to open a file in common with C-p f it switches to a new project root and from now on common is a project on its own (probably because it detects a git repo?)
 - if I jump to a symbol inside project_a defined in common, new project root again, clangd looks for compile_commands.json inside it, doesn&#x27;t find it and fails to resolve symbols.
 I want each project to behave like a single one including common dir both in project navigation and in clangd.
 Any idea? Should I may be disable git project detection in some way?
 Thanks!

 A sample line looks like this:
  
0007600 *words words words $7.20 12/27/21
  
If I just highlight and convert to table, it doesn&#x27;t recognize the &quot;words&quot; part and I have too many columns. For example:
  
| 0007600 | *words | words | words | $7.20 | 12/27/21 |
  
I have a way to use M-x replace-string to add a &quot;|&quot; before every &quot;$&quot; or the date and even at the beginning of each line (the last step).
 Question:
 I need to find a way to insert a &quot;|&quot; after the initial numbers. I have tried replace-regexp with &quot;[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]&quot;, but I cannot find a way to add the &quot;|&quot; after those.
 Is there an easy way to insert a &quot;|&quot; in the 8th position, or after a set of numbers?

 Instead, I’d like some suggestions for VB macros to help me send outlook message links to org-mode. I have org-outlook and a VB macro that copied the link to the message, but here’s what I’d like: a single macro that copies the message link, subject, body, etc., focuses emacs, calls org-capture, then archives the message in Outlook. 
 I just don’t know VB well enough to know where to begin. Anyone have other workflows they have developed to work with Outlook?

                              <span>Hi,
 I enrolled in an &quot;internet programming&quot; class at my college that teaches in both Java and Scala.
 Supposedly the Scala part of the course is in &quot;improvements of Java based system&quot; whatever that means...
 Do you think it&#x27;s generally useful?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to apply all SOLID principles (OOP) to FP Scala. Seems Open Closed doesn&#x27;t apply as well due to the immutability and functional approach (unless we were using Akka persistence but then that event driven mutation abstraction takes care of it already). Liskov Substitution Principle basically says a subtype should be able to replace a super type and that sounds like Covariance to me. Am I wrong?

 However I&#x27;m not sure I understand how these would best fit together in a project. Are there example projects out there or guidance as to how projects would be structured?

                              <span>I decided to integrate some GoJS code into a PureScript Halogen application. I have some funding to do this, so it&#x27;s not just a hobbyist project (though it started that way).
 Creating the Halogen components would be simple enough if one takes inspiration from gojs-react. The issue is that there are no PureScript bindings for the GoJS types themselves, but GoJS does provide .ts.d declarations, which means I could use purescript-read-dts, but that library&#x27;s maturity/usability seems somewhat ambiguous, according to an author&#x27;s post from 3 years ago.
 Conceptually I&#x27;m thinking of generating the bindings, trying to call the code from just PureScript, and adjusting the bindings manually for implicitly effectful computations. I&#x27;m not an experienced PureScript (or Javascript really) developer so I&#x27;m wondering what the community thinks of such a project. I know it&#x27;s big.

                              <span>Hey everyone. Some of you might remember me from long looooong ago...
I used The Archive for a long time. Since then I&#x27;ve progressed through org-mode, obsidian, and any number of other weird tools for my linked writing. At the moment, I&#x27;m mostly using neovim with Renee&#x27;s (remember Renee? He&#x27;s still around!) Telekasten plug-in (check it out if you&#x27;re using neovim).
Anyway, on a whim, I opened The Archive tonight to see how it would deal with the bizarre mess that my zettelkasten is. It works, flawlessly. The only issue is that I had to abandon putting things into subdirectories, which is something that I had been considering doing anyway. So, I did that, and, just in playing around, I got more actual useful connected thinking done tonight than I have in a long, long time.
Much love to Christian and Sascha, again.
Long Live The Archive.</span>

On the 9th of March in the year 2023 or our era, Topiary was born or, at
least, its version 0.1.0 was released. Thus began the quest to package it, to
make it available in various ecosystems. Topiary is a universal formatter engine
written in Rust and packaged with Cargo. Packaging it in nixpkgs was a breeze
because of nixpkgs’ support for Rust, but mostly because someone else did it for us, for which we have to thank our contributor figsoda. It is
therefore already possible to do:
$ echo &#x27;{&quot;foo&quot;  : &quot;bar&quot;   }&#x27; | nix run nixpkgs#topiary -- -l json
{ &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot; }

Great.
Now, Topiary comes with support for OCaml and we want to be able to reach
this community and make it easy for them to use Topiary in their projects.

                              <span>Hello,
 Even before trying out emacs in a more decisive way I had read about emacs pinky and had remapped my caps lock to left ctrl and vice versa and I was awed by how much more sense it makes. (Funny thing is my brother who is not a software engineer made fun of me for switching with the argument that the whole world uses it as is.)
 Now I am finally getting more comfortable in emacs I am trying to figure out whether I should remap the M key somewhere more comfortable.
 In typical keyboards and laptops M is in the left Alt position and therefore feels a bit uncomfortable to type M-x since I strike M with my left thumb and x with either the pointer or the middle finger.
 Is it my left thumb that is useless or does it feel more natural to hit M with the right thumb in the right Alt or AltGr? Currently my right (dominant) thumb feels more flexible and even though I know I will probably get used to it soon, I wonder if there are any clear cut better places for it. What do you guys prefer?
 Thanks

                              <span>I just found this nice minor mode for org.
 One thing I&#x27;m not quite satisfied is that the indentation for the plain text under deep levels is too much. For example, there are like 5 spaces difference between the heading and the text at level 5. 
 I think this behavior is controlled by the internal variable org-indent--text-line-prefixes, which specifies 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, .... In the mean time, the org-indent--heading-line-prefixes is like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.... This is weird to me, as I would think the indentation for the text should be a constant offset relative to the heading. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks.

                              <span>As part of planning my next day, I tag a task as being my &quot;highlight&quot;, the one thing that if I get done, I can call the day a win. As such, I want to block marking my &quot;plan next day&quot; org habit as DONE unless there exists some element that matches &quot;highlight+TODO&#x3D;\&quot;NEXT\&quot;&quot; in my agenda file. Does anyone know of a way to get org elements in a file that match some tags/props matcher progammatically (or even just match on a regex), or tell whether those elements exist so that I can use them as a function on org-blocker-hook? I tried e.g. org-tags-view as well as org-occur-in-agenda-files, but it seems like both of those just open a buffer with the appropriate lines and return nil.

                              <span>I have lsp-java mostly working. About 80% of the time, when I expect a completion menu to appear, I get one after a few seconds. When I don&#x27;t, reloading the buffer often fixes the problem.
 More concerningly, emacs will occasionally lock up for a minute or more. If I send a USR2 signal to emacs, that appears to inject a Quit command and create a backtrace. That, or that with several C-gs, will usually get me back to a point where I can issue command and enter text. That stack traces usually have lsp-process-send near the top. 
 These tend to happen when I try to save a file or wait for a completion menu. (I am using company for completions.)
 At times, the lsp server (jdtls) will start using 8-9 CPUs for several minutes. 
 I&#x27;m assuming this is not normal behavior. :-) Are there things that I can look at to try to understand what is going wrong?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using nix to manage python dependencies (see excerpt of flake.nix below) but this means those python dependencies are in a /nix directory, so when lsp tries to figure out project root for them, it thinks they have nothing to do with my own project. Also I&#x27;m using emacs-direnv to transparently switch into nix environments (.envrc + use flake), so direnv (correctly) unloads my LSP executable (configured in flake.nix), so even if they should be considered totally separate projects LSP-mode doesn&#x27;t know how to start up the server.
 a) should I somehow convince projectile that these files in /nix are actually part of my project?
 b) should I convince direnv to not unload upon visiting these files?
 c) should I tell LSP mode to not try to reconfigure upon visiting dependencies?
 excerpt of flake.nix:

                              <span>A while ago I posted about how I was changing light and dark themes in Emacs. I wanted to provide an update, as it has changed a bit. 
 I am now using the top-right menu on Gnome to enable and disable dark mode. However, old GTK3 applications do not &quot;see&quot; this setting at all.
 To solve this problem I am using:
  
Python script that monitors dbus and changes the GTK theme when selecting dark
 Systemd unit to ensure the script is running all time
 Emacs snippet to react to this change
  
With this setup, having Emacs complied with pure GTK, changing the dark mode on gnome triggers a theme change, while the script triggers a change on the frame decoration. It sounds hacky, but the transition is very smooth and seamless.
 Also, this new code, makes sure that only one theme is configured in Emacs, as having multiple themes selected might be problematic, if themes change different settings.
 (use-package dbus :init (defun theme-switcher (value) ;; 0 &#x3D; No Preference ;; 1 &#x3D; Prefers dark ;; 2 &#x3D; Prefers light. Not currently used by Gnome (let* ((dark-theme &#x27;ef-dark) (light-theme &#x27;ef-frost) (new-theme (if (&#x3D; value 1) dark-theme light-theme)) (switch? (not (member new-theme custom-enabled-themes)))) (when switch? (mapc #&#x27;disable-theme custom-enabled-themes) (load-theme new-theme)))) (defun handler (value) (theme-switcher (car (car value)))) (defun signal-handler (namespace key value) (if (and (string-equal namespace &quot;org.freedesktop.appearance&quot;) (string-equal key &quot;color-scheme&quot;)) (theme-switcher (car value)))) :config (dbus-call-method-asynchronously :session &quot;org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop&quot; &quot;/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop&quot; &quot;org.freedesktop.portal.Settings&quot; &quot;Read&quot; #&#x27;handler &quot;org.freedesktop.appearance&quot; &quot;color-scheme&quot;) (dbus-register-signal :session &quot;org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop&quot; &quot;/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop&quot; &quot;org.freedesktop.portal.Settings&quot; &quot;SettingChanged&quot; #&#x27;signal-handler))

                              <span>Been using Neovim as my &quot;ide&quot;, like to switch to Emacs.
 Neovim pros:
  
Very fast workflow
 well chosen keybindings
 great Project overview
 works in Terminal
 Tabs ❤️
  
Cons: - lack of features (no standardized) - many plugins unstable - sometimes freezes - not all plugins Crossplatform
 Emacs Pros:
  
Lots of features for development and more
 Lisp better than lua or vimscript
 GUI and Terminal
 Org-mode, Magit, ...
 self documentation, file opening, ...
  
Cons: - Bad default movement - complicated Keybindings general
 Some things that are important to me. Biggest thing holding me off from switching are the Keybindings. Just Moving the cursor is already such a strech. I&#x27;ve installed Evil mode but you have to configure it with every other plugin and often end up with doubled behaviour and not everything working as expected. It&#x27;s still very hacky and i&#x27;m not sute if i should be using it.
 My Question is if i should just commit to the default binding? I&#x27;ve heard that they are subjectively bad and cause pinky strain and don&#x27;t allow a fast workflow, and i can see that being the case. But maybe it just comes down to practice.
 Any of you had the same experience coming from Vim? Who uses the default bindings? Do you experience any problems with them?
 Thank you in advance!

 consult-gh provides an interface to interact with GitHub repositories (search, view files and issues, clone, fork, …) from inside Emacs. It uses GitHub CLI and consult to provide an intuitive user-friendly UI in the minibuffer completion familiar to Emacs users.

                              <span>HI,
 I am testing the hacks from u/daviwil (5 Roam hacks), but I get an error from emacs (emacs28):
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function org-roam-node-list) (org-roam-node-list) (seq-filter (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag tag-name) (org-roam-node-list)) (mapcar #&#x27;org-roam-node-file (seq-filter (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag tag-name) (org-roam-node-list))) my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag(&quot;Project&quot;) (setq org-agenda-files (my/org-roam-list-notes-by-tag &quot;Project&quot;)) my/org-roam-refresh-agenda-list() eval-buffer(# nil &quot;/home/fred/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; nil t) ; Reading at buffer position 93895 load-with-code-conversion(&quot;/home/fred/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; &quot;/home/fred/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; t t) load(&quot;/home/fred/.emacs.d/init&quot; noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #) #f(compiled-function () #) t) command-line() normal-top-level() 
 Has this function been replaced by another in a later version of org-roam? I am on Org-roam 2.2.2.42
 Thanks for your help

                              <span>As the title says, what are these called? Does it have a name at all? I was wanting to use it for some custom stuff I&#x27;d like to do like how Doom Emacs uses it for finding files and such.
 Edit: To help give an example, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s used when you use the context-menu-open command

                              <span>I have been using Emacs for 13 years, since 2010, as my main editor and IDE, for every job that I&#x27;ve gone through. There were ups and downs, but overall, I am happy with Emacs especially with the performance improvements in recent years. It makes Emacs on Windows much more joyful.
 Edit: wow, so many people with over 20 years or even 40 years of Emacs experience.That means there are 60 or even 70 year-old users here. Neat.

                              <span>Now that I&#x27;m entering retirement. I hope to get back to making some Emacs content again. I&#x27;m planning a short elisp series but to re-acclimate myself I thought I&#x27;d do a write up and video on building Emacs from source and elfeed-webkit:

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a relatively new Emacs user, using a M1 Macbook, and I&#x27;m unable to get pdf-tools to properly install, hence I&#x27;m resorting to using doc-view + ghostscript to view my pdf documents in Emacs. May I know if there is a way to set the resolution of images that are being converted for viewing?
 (If anyone is able to help me with the pdf-tools installation, I would be immensely grateful! I have tried downloading XQuartz, poppler and automake and set up my init file as per this answer, but I&#x27;m still getting the error that symbol is not found in ARM64 architecture)

                              <span>Emacs experts, I need your help. I run Emacs in text mode in 16-colour terminal emulator. I recently upgraded from Emacs 27 (shipped with Debian 11) to 28 (shipped with Debian 12) and all the colours got horribly messed up. Here is an example from customize-face:
 https://i.imgur.com/KdaaC2J.png
 I speculate this happens because the default colours now assume 256-colour terminal, and indeed if I switch to 256 colours in the terminal emulator the settings look readable:

 The question is how do I easily revert to earlier settings from Emacs 27? I could possible go through all the options and set font faces to desired values, but this will be an extremely tedious task given the amount of options, and I feel like there must be a simple solution for this.
 EDIT: It seems that the problem with colours only happens when running Emacs from inside Tmux, but not when running it directly from a terminal.

                              <span>Hi everyone, When I try to create my daily note with org-roam-dailies-goto-today , the note (title and name) takes yesterday&#x27;s date. The calendar shows the right day for today (if I want to select another date), so it knows today&#x27;s date. But the function goto-today / capture-today is wrong.
 My capture template for the dailies is the default one. And org-roam-dailies-goto-tomorrow also captures yesterday&#x27;s date. Where shall I place the edebug() command to get more feedback from emacs regarding these functions?
 I am using emacs 28.2 on Windows, with org-roam v2.2.2-42
 Any idea? Thanks in advance

                              <span>A few days ago, I wrote up an idea of mine here which some very wonderful person (Karthink) made for me!
 He even gave it a wonderful name: Dired-Delight
 (No, I&#x27;m not renaming it to Dired-Summer, guys 😛)
 Anyway, I thought some of you might want to check it out. Uses would include (for me):
 1) Sorting through lots of files and directories and marking them with colors to say if they&#x27;re processed, or still processing.
 2) Coloring files differently that belong to different categories but you need to keep them in the same folder.
 3) You have a folder with lots of pictures from different decades/eras and you want to visually mark them off.
 Etc...
 Plus it kinda looks pretty.
 Karthink says he wants to give it to me and I&#x27;ll be the maintainer but, as I really have zero experience doing that, I may hold off on that for now. I am learning elisp right now but it&#x27;s slow-going. I&#x27;m doing my best tho. It&#x27;s just got nothing to do with my job so it&#x27;s sometimes hard to find the time for a few hours to get through more lessons. But I&#x27;ll get there. 🙃

                              <span>I find mindmaps (iThoughtsX in my case) very good for quickly organising and editing lists because of:
easy drag and drop movement and
easy hiding and revealing of branches.
Most of the time I take notes in The Archive.
Is there any way to get this type of functionality within The Archive?
If not, is there an external editor that would be good for this?
Thanks!

                              <span>I am currently (as in right now) designing a short (first iteration 5 hours of structured lecturing in total 2 open consulting hours) workshop that is directly geared towards beginners or people who make sure that they nailed the basics.
There are 8 open slots per workshops. A workshop means that you don&#x27;t have to compete for time or attention as if you are in an underfunded public school. So, I decided 8 is a reasonable size. So, it is rather limited.
It is a no-fluff-concept. I won&#x27;t tell you about the history of the method or my backstory. There are no complicated workflow terms you&#x27;ll need to learn or note typology (which is only clouding the applicable knowledge). It is 5 hours of intense learning to get you started (most likely divided in 3 sessions with 2 additional open consulting hours).
Cost: 250-300$ for the whole workshop.
There will be an official announcement. If you are interested, subscribe to the newsletter, send me a daily carrier pigeon and ask how it is going, check the page hourly or use your preferred method of keeping updated.
I am happy to answer any questions.</span>

                              <span>I am looking for documentation on how to write and format the data that is fed to eldoc when eldoc-documentation-function is run. It doesn’t seem to be in the Emacs info pages or web. How do people find out what to do, except by reading the code and reverse engineering it?

                              <span>Many packages like org-krita/org-yt/org-excalidraw/org-xournalpp allow custom files to be displayed inline by means of a custom link type. However, they don&#x27;t work when the file is linked as an attachment, which makes me think that there may be a better way to achieve this. 
 ​
 The org-display-inline-images function uses some functions and variables from image.el such as image-file-name-regexp and create-image to respectively check if the file is an image and to create the image descriptor to display it inline.
 The packages above (except org-yt which is more general) kind of work the same way: there is a project binary file (e.g. .xopp) that gets converted to an image format such as .png and .svg and then it gets displayed inline.
 Would it be possible to define a custom image handler (e.g. for .xopp) that would work exactly the same as, let&#x27;s say, .png, except that it performs a conversion (.xpp -&gt; .png) before actually handling it? And then the second questions: would it be a silly idea?

Other features includes process management, thread/process pooling.
 This seems to be the simplest option to make use of CPU power as physical cores are getting cheaper, so what haven&#x27;t this happened from all those years?

 The problem I am facing is my development environment is on multiple linux machines don’t have root access.
 The three main features I usually use (for C/C++) 1- autocomplete 2- finding definitions 3- static analyzer 
 I am looking for a portable way to configure emacs to support these three features, so that I just copy my emacs folder to another machine and it works.
 Any suggestions would help, thank you in advance.

                              <span>Org mode is incredibly flexible, and I particular I&#x27;ve recently turned my attention into the customizable regexp, they&#x27;re all named something like org-*-regexp: 
  
org-emphasis-regexp-components
 org-outline-regexp 
  
My question is if they could be modified so that org-mode becomes a sort of markdown, for example replacing the stars &#x27;*&#x27; with hashtags &#x27;#&#x27; and the like, and if so, how much it would break (I&#x27;d assume pretty much everything as I&#x27;m using Doom emacs which has a lot of packages I&#x27;m not aware of). For example org-ql has also defined a similar set of variables named org-ql-*regexp (although I&#x27;ve not checked if it&#x27;s a one-to-one correspondence between org regexp and org-ql regexp but is seems promising)
 Also I sort of remember that org-mode was moving away from parsing files using regular expressions in the long term, so even if today was more or less possible, then with each passing year, support for regular expression tweaking would be smaller.
 To what extent is this possible?

 Specifically, I&#x27;m trying to convert the logic at the line labeled with &quot;#1&quot; (a for-comprehension generator(?) that limits processing to only non-empty cells and gets the ball color in a variable for further use).
 What the right/normal/usual way to convert that for a union type?

                              <span>Hi, I recenty started using emacs. I installed bitlbee and bitlbee-discord, and everything is working fine in principle. But it is a bit annoying to have to add the account every time I restart emacs. Is there a way I can save the account list in the bitlbee config or smth, or otherwise automate the &#x60;account add ...&#x60; to be executed when I start bitlbee?

                              <span>Okay so, I&#x27;ve been using dired/dirvish now for a while. I&#x27;m on a Mac and I almost never use the Finder anymore to sort through files and manage them because dired is so amazing. But, here&#x27;s a suggestion for a package (and please let me know if one already exists that does this):
 I want to colorize files/directories to visually group them. And I&#x27;ll explain:
 In MacOS, you can select files and folders and click on File at the top menu and get a selection of colors which you have defined. They are essentially tags and you can add multiple colors to files/folders this way and also define them however you want. You can also search for them in this way. Tagging files and folders will put a colored dot next to their icon or next to their name in the Icon view. My idea for this package would be:

 I get empty matches when trying to use M-x consult-ripgrep.I&#x27;ve also set up this function:
 (defun search/project-text-search nil (interactive) (consult-ripgrep (projectile-project-root))) 
 And tried to call it with M-x, but I get the same result.
 Here is my use-package definition:
 (use-package consult :defines (consult-line consult-buffer consult-find consult-find-project consult-ripgrep consult-recent-file) :straight t :bind ((&quot;C-s&quot; . consult-line) (&quot;C-x b&quot; . consult-buffer) (&quot;C-x C-b&quot; . consult-buffer) (&quot;C-x C-f&quot; . consult-find))) 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.2.7 on Fedora 38 (KDE spin) and I have just been experiencing some odd new behaviour when I switch to an open Emacs window. Things work without a problem until I use MS Teams for a video call (using an external webcam). Once I&#x27;ve done that, every time I return to Emacs I get multiple errors saying 
  is undefined 
 When I press a key the error goes away and I can use Emacs as usual but if I move to another application and then back to Emacs the error messages return again. I&#x27;m not using any packages that I know of that require a webcam. This behaviour only seems to have started since the recent .7 update to Emacs and happens using both Wayland and X11. I can&#x27;t seem to replicate the problem on my laptop that has a built-in webcam. I&#x27;d be very grateful if anyone could provide some ideas as to what&#x27;s going on or how to identify the problem. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to build the latest version of emacs from source on arch linux. As far as I can see I have all the required dependencies.
 I ran the ./configure command with native compilation and pgtk3 options and it seemed to run fine.
 When I run make, I get an error and it fails. I don&#x27;t know much about C (or elisp for that matter) but as far as I can tell, the crux of the error message is this:
 ​
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (void-function seq-some) make[2]: *** [Makefile:916: bootstrap-emacs.pdmp] Error 255 make[2]: Leaving directory &#x27;/home/me/computing/emacs/src&#x27; make[1]: *** [Makefile:544: src] Error 2 
 ​
 Does anyone know what is going wrong?
 ​
 I have also tried to build and install aur packages for emacs 29 using an aur helper and run into a similar error.
 ​
 Thanks.
 ​
 PS. sorry if this is lacking information, i am not very experienced with this process.

                              <span>Here is a minimal example:
 ​
 I have &#x60;outline-minor-0&#x60; wich has some attributes applied. I don&#x27;t care which attributes are applied on the face, I just want it to have a *red* foreground. So i write the following line in my init file:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;outline-minor-0 nil :foreground &quot;red&quot;)
 However, the truth is that &#x60;outline-minor-0&#x60; has already applied these attributes: &#x60;:background &quot;light grey&quot; :weight &#x27;bold&#x60;. The 3 attributes get mixed together so the resulting attributes of &#x60;outline-minor-0&#x60; are: red foreground, light grey background, bold weight when I just wanted a red foreground! 
 ​
 I could specify &#x60;:background &#x27;undefined :weight &#x27;undefined&#x60; to remove those attributes, but I&#x27;d like to implicitly reset every other unspecified attribute. How can I do it?

Ideally, I eventually want to reach a state where something like &quot;std::arr&quot; will have options to auto-complete to &quot;std::array&quot; (as an example).
 I took a look at Gavin Freeborn&#x27;s init.el to get some hints, but between this and the corfu, cape, and clang-capf READMEs, I can&#x27;t figure out what the right settings are. Any help or clarification would be much appreciated, or if one could point me in a good direction or to a resource that would be great too.

                              <span>I have a collection of about 5,000 text files (html, actually) that comprise Texas statutes and its constitution. Every two years the files are updated. The next update will be in a few months.
Contretemps with a local tax appraisal agency inspires me to track their activities. I want to take notes and link to appropriate statutes.
When the statutes are updated, I want to replace the old copies with the new. Like anyone both wanting and eating cake, I&#x27;d like for my links to survive the file replacement.
I can link to a document. I can link to a document name, and that solves the problem if the document name remains constant over revision.
What I would really like is a link to &quot;all files containing Texas Unemployment Compensation&quot; and &quot;201.011&quot;.
Right now, I&#x27;m using Devonthink. I can save a search as a smart group and then link to the smart group, but that&#x27;s quite a bit of friction for creating a link. I think it also may not fit intimately with Devonthink&#x27;s AI based See Also feature.
Any thoughts appreciated. I also appreciate the hospitality here.  The discussion is wonderful.</span>

                              <span>So today I noticed that a lot of my info entries disappeared in the Top node, only Emacs info files and the SBCL info files are showed. I can still access those missing manuals by using C-h R, and the system info file directories (/usr/local/share/info and /usr/share/info) are still in Info-directory-list. I am using vanilla GNU Emacs 29.0.91 on Void GNU/Linux.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 You guy must have a working config for Emacs lsp-mode for typescript major mode.
 Seems my config keeps producing an error : &quot;The connected server does not support method textDocument/declaration...use M-x lsp-describe-session&quot;
 M-x lsp-describe-session --&gt; produces an empty buffer...so no values there.
 Tried few config tricks but none seems to work, and C-c l does not work either:
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :commands (lsp lsp-deferred)
 :init
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) ;; Or &#x27;C-l&#x27;, &#x27;s-l&#x27;
 :config
 (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t))
 ​
 (use-package typescript-mode
 :mode &quot;\\.ts\\&#x27;&quot;
 :hook (typescript-mode . lsp-deferred)
 :config
 (setq typescript-indent-level 2))
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated.
 Thank you
 ​

                              <span>I like stickers and all, but sometimes I want to be able to set a (break) somewhere in the code and have the step into/out/over functionality that I get with (step ...). However, when I use break in sly, i get thrown into a generic debugging buffer. Typing B to use the default debugger does nothing other than freeze the repl until I C-c. I am remoting into a slynk server so this might be the reason, but this is not mentioned in the docs I believe. Is this the correct behavior?

                              <span>I&#x27;m most likely being pretty picky here. I&#x27;m trying to unset a keybinding in CC-Mode, and it does seem to work (what I did below):  (add-hook c-mode-common-hook (lambda() (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-o&quot;))))  Though for some reason it still shows up in the Major mode bindings list in the help page. Why is that?

I have commercial experience 17 years in 1C:Enterprise 8 (russian platphorm for accounting automation) but I am Ukrainian. I know OOP principes and patterns. I create own applications based on cats effects. I know SQL and doobie. Can I find a job as beginner Scala? What I have to learn before I get a job. Thanks for answers before.

 We have some volunteers who are not much computer literate, and would benefit from an app or site with live-preview mode, similar to
 dillinger or markdownlivepreview
 I am aware of sites like github, gitlab, gitea, etc who offer org-mode syntax rendering, but we would need live-preview.
 Is there any such app or site for org-mode syntax? Commercial ones would be fine too.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I am new to Scala and have learnt about it as I am having 2 courses at my uni,
 in order to learn a new programming paradigm. 
 We are using Scala 3 at Uni.
 I have for myself found, that I do not learn a lot from doing the exercises, but the mere syntax.
 We are provided with code via gitlab and only have to compile basically.
 I would like to do some own little projects in scala to get deeper into it and exercise before the exams.
 I&#x27;ve my setup in IntelliJ and I am using sbt.
 So far the issue I am having is I do not get how to manage dependancies correctly.
 Or say I really don&#x27;t know how to manage them at all.
 I thought potentially you guys got some good source here.
 I am essentially looking for some sort of quickstart, that helps me out setting up my environments eas…</span>

 Functional applications offer numerous benefits in modern software development. They enhance testability, modularity, and composability, leading to more maintainable and scalable codebases. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore the syntax and semantics of functional applications and introduce the app-toolkit library—a powerful tool for building functional applications more efficiently.
 Syntax and Semantic of an App
 At its core, an app can be represented as a function that takes an input (I) and produces an output (O). By incorporating side effects, we extend this representation to I &#x3D;&gt; F[O], where F[_] denotes the ability to handle side effects.
 Resources
 To build an app, we rely on resources such as app information, input arguments, a logger, and configuration settings.

I&#x27;m considering using A7 index cards for my main box, and A8 index cards for my bibliographical box (yes, I want to build an analogic Zettelkasten). I presume that single cards will be sufficient for my notes in most cases, and if I need some more space I can always make a &quot;double&quot; note by using two cards (or even more).
What do you think? What size are your cards?</span>

I saw about reference manager tools (like Zotero) for the process of note-taking (not especially for Zettelkasten).
Is it as useful as it pretends to be ?
Why do you use one ?
How does it fit in your workflow ?
Thanks !</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs for the past 5 years, and I&#x27;m ashamed to say I don&#x27;t really know Emacs. Today I came across meow and wanted to try it out; I commented out my .emacs.d folder and started from scratch.
 Simple things like the M-x popup isn&#x27;t actually stock. In Doom, it&#x27;s provided by a package called vertico. Then other packages provide fuzzy matching in vertico.
 To get out from M-x I had to press Escape 3 times. And this is without bringing up how unintuitive the keybindings are (like moving around).
 Emacs could do with much needed polish. Without Doom Emacs (and its configuration) and the amazing packages people provide, I don&#x27;t think I could use Emacs.
 It&#x27;s no wonder Emacs isn&#x27;t really brought up in conversation. I would like to see improvements in usability. It needs built-in quality-of-life improvements to be more accessible to people. Emacs being extremely powerful and extensible means nothing if the average person isn&#x27;t able to use that to their benefit.
 I hope I didn&#x27;t come across as too criticising; I do love Emacs and spend most of my day in it. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs to edit my latex documents. I have the auctex emacs package installed, as well as latex-preview-pane.
 I would like to use the siunitx latex package. 
 I installed the package doing:
 sudo apt -y install texlive-science
 When I compile my document using directly latex:
 pdflatex mydoc.tex
 it works, but when I&#x27;m within emacs, the latex-preview-pane package cannot compile my document.
 I guess I have to tell emacs and auctex where to find the packages I installed when I installed texlive-science. 
 How can I solve this ?
 PS : I know that the error in latex-preview-pane comes from the \usepackage[siunitx], because if I comment this line, it works perfectly.

                              <span>After struggling for years to manage my personal finances, found ledger/hledger. My goal is to find my yearly expense so that I can make FIRE plan. Ledger is great, but required to create transactions in ledger. Struggled with parsing bank/card pdfs, manually creating entries and nothing worked. Eventually realized that I can just copy the text from pdf into emacs and then format it using emacs macros. Then next task was to convert the transaction lines into ledger entries. This gave birth to &#x60;ob-ledger-convert&#x60; or &#x60;ob-lc&#x60; to provide &#x60;lc&#x60; src blocks in the org mode which when executed convert the given transactions into ledger format. It does need parsers and I have provided some of the parsers used by me in the &#x60;ob-lc&#x60; module. New parsers can be added easily.
 This post is to share the enthusiasm of the emacs being such a fascinating machine which lets you do anything you want and also to get the feedback from the community on the package.
 The sample org file provided in the repo provides a gist of how to use the module.

                              <span>hey! I&#x27;m a newly-converted Linux user (dabbled with it a bunch but it finally feels to have really stuck), and I&#x27;ve always used vim as a default console editor, which has been good, feels pretty fast, though all i really do is edit config files with it.
 i hear a ton about emacs, and the lengths to which people take it, but i don&#x27;t actually know what it can do
 basically all i know is that it&#x27;s a very configurable text editor, but from what I&#x27;ve heard, that description doesn&#x27;t really do it justice.
 so basically, tldr, what makes emacs so good? why do people like it so much?

 But sometimes I can change unrelated parts of a buffer unconciously. Sometimes I delete some part of a buffer, sometimes I copy a huge part of another buffer into this buffer and have a very long extra parts that are hidden under an org heading.
 So the problem is I sometimes change the file in some unwanted way. Most of the time those goes unnoticed and long time I see some inconsistencies with the file itself and how the it should be. I see that the file does not have integrity. This is a bad experience mostly. So I wanted to be able track contents of every save operation I make to the files.

                              <span>For a while now, Tweag has committed in improving various aspects of
Liquid Haskell (LH), a tool that gives the Haskell
programmer both the ability to express properties about programs
and to verify that they meet these expectations.
In this post we present a specific improvement that I integrated
recently, which cuts down the maintenance cost to use LH
when introducing assumptions about functions coming
from large or multiple packages.

Problem: How to reason about dependencies
Let us suppose that we are trying to verify that the following
function yields a non-empty list.
module M where

{-@ consPlus1 :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; { v:[Int] | len v &gt; 0 } @-}
consPlus1 :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
consPlus1 x xs &#x3D; map (+1) (x:xs)

The definition starts with a comment dedicated to LH, delimited by {-@ ..…</span>

 I am pretty certain that it is not possible as is... how to make it possible?

 This is a project born by personal need and mostly for personal use and very much still work in progress, so use at your own discretion. I am still testing it as I had to customize large parts of calfw and calfw-blocks to my liking (working on the interface for modifying and adding events now).
 Bug reports and possible improvements are welcome.
 ​
 A bit of background: I was trying to find ways to view and modify my calendars from within Emacs which lead me down the rabbit hole of figuring out calendar clients for my Google Calendar, my Apple calendar and my work Office365 calendar. Clients for Office365 are particularly annoying with the new Oauth2 system; an app has to be trusted by Microsoft which pretty much means that all open source clients are unusable unless one has admin control over the Azure environment.
 After some pointless struggle, I decided to just rely on my local MacOS calendar app to handle all the authentication and to sync my calendars. I wrote a simple interface in Swift which can be imported in Emacs and then used to feed events into calfw.

                              <span>Hi everybody ! I&#x27;d like to use all the icons with treemacs but I can&#x27;t figure how to do it. I tried (straight-use-package &#x27;treemacs-all-the-icons) I use straight package manager, but it doesn&#x27;t work. I tried (treemacs-load-theme &quot;all-the-icons&quot;) but didn&#x27;t work either. Any ideas ?

Does anybody know about this feature? I checked the github page and my local package is labeled &quot;20230426.2324&quot;. Its installed from melpa (i guess).

                              <span>To preface - I started using emacs about 2 years ago, and this is my first real foray into trying to make something of my own.
 I&#x27;ve been trying for a while to find an emacs startpage that I find useful. I work mostly out of org files, so I have no use for the scratch buffer, the default is fine but a little lacking in functionality (for me at least) and I tried the dashboard.el package (which is what inspired me to try to make my own).
 My goal is to take a single buffer and divide it into multiple regions, so that, for example, the top half could display a calendar (I use calfw, so I had intended to show the one week view here) and the bottom half could be divided into left and right. (I had wanted to show magit-list-repos and org-agenda here). I didn&#x27;t see any existing packages that see…</span>

                              <span>Just as the title says, Scala&#x27;s community looks very pessimistic on how the language is progressing on the basis of what I read here and from say blog posts.
 Context is that I&#x27;m an AI engineer in R&amp;D. Currently I do just about everything in Python, SQL with a sprinkle of R. I know some Scala 2, Java and C++ as well. To me, Scala always felt like the ideal marriage of having a great type system and not having the annoying things you&#x27;d associate from static typing.
 I think the pessimism hurts adoption as folk like myself become skeptical. That&#x27;s sad because at least in theory the language does exactly what people like me need: a pragmatic yet principled way to make software. Scala 3, especially, looks flexible enough for scripting and interactive stuff with for example polynote. Type safety also reduces the footguns compared to Python.
 It won&#x27;t deter me, I&#x27;ll keep on going but at the very least I wanted to share my thoughts.

 https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/ti-developer-ecosystem-survey-2023
 The last year the Scala community was underrepresented and in result we weren&#x27;t able to say much about the state of Scala. Please help us change it this year. Tell your collegues about it, it in your companies, on the campus, at meetups, etc. We need everyone :)

                              <span>Does the Refined library for Scala (at https://github.com/fthomas/refined; &quot;eu.timepit&quot; %% &quot;refined&quot;) work in Scala 3? Does it work differently?
 I&#x27;m having trouble in migrating some code that uses Refined from Scala 2 to Scala 3.
 The code is:
 import eu.timepit.refined.api.{Refined, RefinedTypeOps}
 import eu.timepit.refined.numeric.Interval.Closed
 object Example {
 type MyType &#x3D; Int Refined Closed[1, 3]
 object MyType extends RefinedTypeOps.Numeric[MyType, Int]
 val good: MyType &#x3D; MyType(1) // 2.13: works
 val bad: MyType &#x3D; MyType(42) // 2.13: correctly fails with error re 42 &gt; 3
 }
 It works fine with Scala 2.13.11 (with dependency &quot;eu.timepit&quot; %% &quot;refined&quot; % &quot;0.11.0&quot;), compiling per the comments.
 However, with Scala 3 (I tried 3.0.0, 3.3.0) the line with good fails compilation with the error &quot;object MyType in object Example does not take parameters&quot;.
 It looks like an apply method implemented using RefineMacro.implApplyRef disappeared for the Scala 3 version of eu.timepit.refined.api.RefinedTypeOps. 
 Does the Scala 3 version still support compile-time validation of literal values to refined types? 
 If so, how? (That is, what do I change &quot;MyType(1)&quot; to in order to have it work in Scala 3?)
 Thanks.

 I can&#x27;t find a way to make this set-up work: 
 SCHEDULED:  DEADLINE:  SCHEDULED:  DEADLINE:  SCHEDULED:  
 How do you schedule tasks which have a repeater that has to change over time?

                              <span>By default exporting org-agenda to an .ics file to share it with other calendar apps marks both scheduled and unscheduled todo headings as VTODO items (via org-icalendar-combine-agenda-filescommand). It causes some calendar clients to read them incorrectly by scheduling todo headings with current time or showing scheduled events in a todo list.
 I wrote a systemd .service file (with a bit of help) to switch all scheduled todo headings as VEVENTS and unscheduled as VTODOs. From initial tests it seems to be working correctly on Thunderbird and calcurse.
 It works by checking if an entry in the .ics file uses current time for DTSTART (that&#x27;s what icalendar assigns to unscheduled todo headings). If it does then it should be a VTODO, otherwise a VEVENT.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;d like to introduce you some interesting lists and rankings related to the Scala open source ecosystem:
 - Top Contributors (global or by country): https://opensource-heroes.com/contributors?language&#x3D;scala
 - Trending projects: https://opensource-heroes.com/discover/scala (based on GitHub stars increase)
 - Awesome projects: https://opensource-heroes.com/awesome/scala (we plan to add soon a new feature to allow everyone to contribute to that list directly from the site)
 You can also find &quot;stars&quot; history in the detail page of some repos (it will be available soon for all Scala repos, we&#x27;re still processing some data!) and embed this chart in your README.
 Hope you find this content useful! Any feedback is really appreciated. Please note that be are still in beta 🙏 We want to build a platform that allows everybody to easily explore the open source world! 
 We just released a new &quot;Interviews&quot; section (https://opensource-heroes.com/interviews) with open source contributors explaining their journey, motivations, challenges, tools, ... Tell us your Scala journey!

 How can I make it happen? Here is my configuration, do I miss something?

 :config (message &quot;hello org&quot;) ;; this for checking if the org mode loaded. ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been really frustrated lately, trying to get black text on white background. I want to I use my e-ink tablet as an external screen when programming out in the sunshine. But it has turned out that something as simple as a high contrast theme with a pure white background and black text is beyond my abilities. 
 For some reason, M-x set-background-color white sets the background to gray when running emacs in a terminal. Even setting the background color to #ffffff results in a gray background (and in me shouting frustrated at the monitor). I can get pure white with xemacs, but I&#x27;m mostly working on our development servers remotely over slow ssh connections, so xemacs is out of the equation. 
 Of the standard themes, whiteboard comes closest, but is also gray background, smudged and hard to read on e-ink. Literally every light theme I&#x27;ve downloaded has been some variant of smudgy yellow, gray or teal for the background. Grayish text on grayish background is virtually illegible on e-ink. 
 I found an &quot;e-ink&quot; theme here: https://emacsthemes.com/themes/eink-theme.html. This gets me black text on a white background... mixed with white text on a white background (#includes and other syntax highlighting), so also not useable. 
 Can it really be that difficult to get real black text on real white background? What is the obvious thing I&#x27;m missing? I&#x27;m happy to have some syntax highlighting in (dark) gray, but the main text needs to be pure black, and most importantly the background should be actual white. 
 Please help, my inability to get something so trivial to work is hurting my self-esteem!

                              <span>hi, how can I use a variable from outer scope in &#x60;cl-function&#x60; for ex:
 (cl-function (lambda (&amp;key data &amp;allow-other-keys) (append (list (json-parse-string data)) callback-args))) 
 ​
 the callback-args are defined in the outer scope of this function, how to include it in the current function, already tried
  &#x60;(append (list (json-parse-string data)) ,callback-args)

 I really love Magit (as I am sure a lot of people do). One thing that annoys me quite a lot is that, when I run magit-branch-checkout, the list of branches are shown alphabetically I think, when what I really want is the branches to be ordered by my most recent. 
 Any idea on how to achieve this?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>I use tmux on a remote server for persistence. I find it useful to have a multi-term buffer inside my local emacs that is then ssh&#x27;ed into this server and then I can also attach to my persistent tmux session. 
 My question applies even if I skip the tmux step. In my term window I may want to edit a file that is local to the remote. Running emacs in that window, I loose control of emacs shortcuts: everything including closing the remote emacs goes to my emacsclient running on my laptop. Is there a way to solve this? Can I keep my workflow, and edit a file remotely like this? 
 In solving this, I don&#x27;t want to give up on all shortcuts passed to my local emacsclient when I am not editing a file remotely like this.
 This is not the same as running emacs inside multi-term that is running bash locally. For that, I use emacsclient (my local emacs is running as a server) and so I can open any file in my emacs client locally. One solution would be to pass -X to ssh and have a gui running locally.

                              <span>Hello there!
 I am pretty new to emacs and at the moment I try to configure lsp-mode with pylsp. In my understanding I can just use a hook at prog-mode to run lsp (seems to work). The only problem is that emacs wont find pylsp. I allready hacked something together to prepend the emacs intern PATH var (read by using (getenv &quot;PATH&quot;) with the path to the directory which contains the pylsp executable but it just says that it cannot find it. This problem only exists when starting emacs via dmenu and not via a &quot;normal&quot; terminal which uses my zshrc with the appropriate PATH var I guess.
 My config can be found here
 Any help would be appreciated. Have a Great Day!

                              <span>Hi, sorry if theres a huge lack of context. But I am banking on the community expertise. Basically, I started the Emacs journey from Spacemacs, to another programmers (stranger, Kaushal Modi) config (init.el). Im okay with learning slowly at my own pace, and Im learning eLisp at my own pace. I ve been using S- and S- for navigation (same goes for up and down). I was okay for months, but now Im looking to remove that Shift for good. Using hardcore-mode seems to work, but Id have to do it everytime I startup. Setting (hardcore-mode 0) doesnt work.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been making &quot;come-here...&quot; eyes at emacs for a year or more now, but also had a pretty crazy year, which has led to a return to school for a career change. Looking for a good, cross-platform note-taking/workflow thing, and heard about Obsidian, Evernote, Roam, Foam...and came across this thread. Talm&#x27; bout eMacs being able to do a lot of what the new-fangled apps are bragging about. Put it this way - I got a couple months that are kinda-sorta free, so if you&#x27;re telling me this is a valid excuse to run through emacs, I&#x27;m sold. One step closer to achieving true FOSS nerd-dom, after dabbling in it from the edges.
 But, like I said in the title, I&#x27;m mostly a fan of FOSS for ideological reasons, and past recognizing names of things I don&#x27;t actually have that much ability. So, I gotta be that guy and ask for any advice on easy-to-set-up-and-understand emacs-centered solutions to note-taking. Specifically, I need something that I can sync between my Linux Mint laptop and Android, or that I can make sync. Searchable across devices/files is big, too. I can go a step further in being an entitled new guy, if there are any good resources - youtube playlists, blogs, articles, whatever - on something like &quot;designing/customizing workflow for your industry/goals in emacs,&quot; that&#x27;d be cool, too.
 Thanks for bearing w/me, here&#x27;s hoping I&#x27;ll finally be joining this community.

                              <span>Alain M. Lafon described in 2022 a neat way to export org-agenda to .ics (for other calendar clients). However, in emacs 28.3 a lot of his commands seem to be missing. Does anyone know what package provides org-batch-store-agenda-views or org-agenda-export-to-ics ?
 Doom emacs only provides org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files for exporting .ics.
 This command seems necessary to replace VTODO with VEVENT types.
 WORKAROUND: You can just run sed command on the exported .ics instead whenever cron job exports .ics to replace all VTODO with VEVENT: sed -i &#x27;s/VEVENT/VTODO/g&#x27; org.ics

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I&#x27;m looking for here, so this is going to be a bit open-ended. But I was wondering if there was a way to produce statistics on a group of org files. Here are some examples of what I mean.
 Example #1 - Tag Count
 You create TODO items over an entire year. Your TODO&#x27;s all have at least one, but possibly more, tags. Those tags are &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;Spouse&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, and &quot;Fun&quot;, for example. At the end of the year, you want to know how you divided your time. Is there an easy way to produce output like this:
  
Work - 30
 School - 28
 Personal - 24
 Spouse - 20
 Home - 17
 Fun - 11
  
Example #2 - Avg Time
 You spend a year completing tasks. At the end of that year, is there an easy way to display how long tasks took to complete? Maybe broken down by tag?
 I&#x27;m sure there are lots of other ways of summarizing and splicing the various meta data collected, so if anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;m open to it.

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;m a new Emacs user who&#x27;s been using Doom Emacs but I recently decided to switch over to a personal config. One things that I want to do asap is set up a lot of my keybinds to mostly mirror the ones set by Doom. That being said, there are a lot of binds to copy over and I don&#x27;t want to do all of the hard manual labor of setting them all. More specifically, I want to copy over a lot of the useful leader key functionality that Doom sets. For instance, if I were to hit  W in Doom, it would function about the same as if I hit  in evil mode. As of right now, I&#x27;m using the general package to set my binds for the leader key manually but it&#x27;s kind of a pain in the ass, especially for such a massive set of commands like the  or  functionality. Is there a way to either 
 A.) More easily port over most of the keybinds from Doom? (I know a lot of them are package specific but still)
 B.) Easily set certain default Emacs keybinds to other key combinations? (E.g set  W to be equivalent to  and  H to be equivalent to

 I want to switch to use Emacs daemon with the provided systemd user unit emacs.service for quicker startup but if I simply enable and start it, it doesn&#x27;t restore any frames. I see that there&#x27;s this thread which seems to work on restoring a single frame, but how to restore/save multiple frames like my initial setup? Unfortunately I barely know any elisp.
 Much appreciated.

 Many of us know that Emacs defaults for garbage collection are rather ancient and often cause singificant slowdowns. However, it is hard to know which alternative defaults will be better.
 Emacs devs need help from users to obtain real-world data about Emacs garbage collection. See the discussion in https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87v8j6t3i9.fsf@localhost/
 I wrote a small package https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html that will collect garbage collection stats during Emacs sessions. Please, install it and later (after few weeks) submit the results to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org
 Usage:
 Add
 (require &#x27;emacs-gc-stats) (setq emacs-gc-stats-gc-defaults &#x27;emacs-defaults) ; optional (emacs-gc-stats-mode +1) 
 to your init file to enable the statistics acquiring.
 When you are ready to share the results, run M-x emacs-gc-stats-save-session and then share the saved emacs-gc-stats-file (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/emacs-gc-stats.eld) by sending an email attachment to .
 You can use M-x emacs-gc-stats-clear to clear the currently collected session data.
 The following data is being collected after every command:
  
 GC settings gc-cons-threshold and gc-cons-percentage
  Emacs version and whether Emacs framework (Doom, Prelude, etc) is used
  Whether gcmh-mode is used
  Idle time and Emacs uptime
  Available OS memory (see memory-info)
  Emacs memory allocation/GC stats
  Current command

                              <span>Hey guys
 I have found an issue when update the header line(although I am not sure if this even is an issue).
 While displaying information in the header line, not everything is updated at the same time in the *Messages* buffer.
 Code I used to enable header line in scratch buffer:
 (setq wat 0) (defun initialize-header-line () (interactive) (setq header-line-format &#x27;(:eval (message (format &quot;header line updated %d&quot; (setq wat (+ wat 1))))))) 
 My question is:
 Why is the header line being updated on every key movement, but the *Messages* buffer doesn&#x27;t display the &quot;header line updated&quot; on every key movement? Is this expected?
 I also added a gif screencast to show this issue(sorry for the quality, This is the best that I was able to record):

 As a result I made r/haskell private: https://discourse.haskell.org/t/r-haskell-is-going-dark/6405?u&#x3D;taylorfausak
 Now I have re-opened r/haskell as read-only. In terms of what happens next, I will leave it up to the community. This post summarizes the current situation and possible reactions: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14cr2is/alternative_forms_of_protest_in_light_of_admin/
 Please comment and vote on suggestions in this thread.
 Regardless of the outcome of this vote, I would suggest that people use the official Haskell Discourse instead of r/haskell: https://discourse.haskell.org

                              <span>Hi ! I&#x27;m a bit confused with the goal of permanent note in a standard ZK workflow.
Sometimes, I feel it is redundant or useless.
Context: I mainly use note-taking to capture and convert informations into pieces of reusable cards (for technical docs). My main interest are science (physics/math) and computer science (programing/software/web).
What I pretend to know about permanent note
In pure theory, I believe (maybe I&#x27;m wrong ) a permanent note is a card :
that should contain enough text about a specific topic (atomic)
that should contain enough informations to &quot;live alone&quot; (self-contained)
that should be reusable in other topic context (portable)
that should contain links to spread the web
that should contain references to sources (context)
The permenant note, from my head to paper
When I have an idea, I write it down to paper (fleeting note) and I must convert this note into a well-formed, in my own word permanent note.
I am unconfortable with this new permanent note because there is no reference at all.
The permanent note, from books to idea
When I read about literary note (or reference note), it is said I should pick up an interesting passage, write it into my own words and so on.
literary note into multiple &quot;ideas&quot; which are called permanent note.
I really don&#x27;t see the difference between the aggregated permanent note in my literary note.
This feeling is intensified when I write a technical subject (e.g. http).
Maybe I suffer from misconception and you could provide some keys to understand please.
If someone knows about some basic samples of ZK implementations, it would be great !
Thank you !</span>

                              <span>So if I use C-c C-c to execute this then my org-agenda-mode-map correctly shows H-, and H-. with the below listed functions. But when I load the tangled lisp at startup it does not. 
 Getting an error that org-agenda-mode-map is void variable 
 I also tried
  
 both :map commands under 1 :bind heading
 define-key org-agenda-mode-map style of binding (same error)
  
of note after my startup config loads I can run this execute and it executes which seems to me like there is some load issue with the map during the use-package setup but once my config loads I can &quot;rerun&quot; the code block and make it work...not ideal.

                              <span>Orgzly is a popular android client that allows you to edit org files in a feature-rich and intuitive way. However, for over 4 years its syncing mechanism for local repositories (not webdav) suffered from a critical bug.
 If you try to delete a file on one of your machines orgzly (running on another machine) will recreate it - meaning you can&#x27;t ever delete any file in your org-mode directory AND have it synced with orgzly. This makes any form of administration that relies on many disparate files impossible (e.g. org-roam):
 https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/287
 If anyone has any experience with developing on android and would like to support this otherwise great project, this may be a perfect opportunity to do so.
 UPDATE: it is possible that the project might have been abandoned.
 UPDATE2: As mentioned in the comments syncing with WebDAV instead of local directories may not to have this issue. I&#x27;m checking if nextcloud provides encryption when using WebDAV (if someone has already configured it please let me know).

 I am trying to refile a cancelled task under the &#x27;*CANCEL&#x27; heading.
 I want to refile the following task:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 *** CANCELLED Match Figma Templates
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ​
 Remaining File For Context
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 * Jira Tickets
 ** Todo
 ** In Progress
 *** CANCELLED Match Figma Templates
 ** COMPLETE
 ** CANCEL
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When I hit &#x27;C-c C-w&#x27; to use &#x27;org-refile&#x27;, I can only refile the &#x27;*** CANCELLED Match Figma Templates&#x27; under &#x27;* Jira Tickets&#x27;.
 Is there a related Emacs config variable I can use to allow any level heading?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I tried Chemacs2 but switching to my Org Mode based Emacs config that has a &#x27;config.org&#x27; with &#x27;init.el&#x27; doesn&#x27;t work as easy as just literally using GNU Stow with &#x27;stow -t ~/.emacs.d&#x27;. The problem with that is that I have to constantly wipe out that &#x27;~/.emacs.d&#x27; directory each time, let it install everything, and let &#x27;vterm&#x27; compile again which takes a good 5 mins each time.
 ​
 Goal:
  
I&#x27;m trying to switch between my normal config and the Spacemacs config.
 This is because I&#x27;ve been trying to check out Spacemacs to see what I like from it to later then adapt it with my own config or just use Spacemacs for web dev projects since I hate configuring LSP myself.
  
​
 Questions:
 Q1. Has anyone with an Org Mode based config used anything similar, and if so, what have you used?
 Q2. Or should I somehow add my actual Emacs config to the Spacemacs config too? If so, how?
  
I ask this because there are some quality of life changes I have in my normal Emacs config that annoy me so much for the defaults for Emacs in general, especially with Org mode defaults sometimes.
  
Thanks

                              <span>I built emacs from source, native comp, a few months ago and recently heard about pgtk. Is this worth it (for more smoothness, better user experience) on MacOS? I saw this thread: https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos/issues/45 where it was mentioned that you have to turn off the MacOS specific flag, so I’m not sure if it’s more harm than good, and what benefit it may serve. Anyone have experience optimizing their emacs on MacOS as much as possible? I basically run native comp vanilla emacs with only about 100 lines in my init file, which I byte compile (I’m not sure if the init file byte compilation helps? It seems like even though packages get compiled down natively, going into the native code folder (alongside byte compilations) , init.el doesn’t have an option for it).

                              <span>Hi,
 All-the-icons maintainer here.
 Over the years, all-the-icons have been inundated by user issues about mis-aligning fonts, tofus and font installation or code point clashing problems. This is all the result of cross-pollination of a set of Web front end tricks of a certain era to Emacs.
 The problems of using icon font are
  
They require extra manual installation of fonts
 Amalgamation of different icon fonts designed for different grids and negative spaces result in non-uniform display of fonts
 Code point clashes
 Updating the fonts and their mappings are painful
 Fonts don&#x27;t scale properly even with a lot of manual adjustments
 The project gets an incessant amount of issues opened due to all of the above
  
Since last August, I have been experimenting with simply using the SVG sources of these fonts directly instead, and I&#x27;m happy to announce that I&#x27;m satisfied with the result enough that I want to invite the community to try out the SVG branch.
 There are now over 18000 icons included in the package, and over 31000 when you count all the variations. Chances are, if you are looking for an icon that looks good and appropriate, it&#x27;s probably in there.
 The public API largely remains the same, but there are some backward incompatible changes in the private APIs. Please refer to the README for details.
 Judging from Github searches, these changes do not appear to cause too much breakage, but I could be wrong. Please let me know on Github as I do not plan to come back to Reddit too often because of a certain u/spez.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve repeatedly seen the claim that frequent breaking changes to the language are one reason why Scala isn&#x27;t more widely adopted in the industry. While I can only speak from my personal experience I don&#x27;t really see the point here. It seems to me that other languages and ecosystems get away with big changes:
  
Python&#x27;s adoption has only increased after the infamous 2 -&gt; 3 version change.
 JavaScript itself is backwards-compatible with older versions, but the JS ecosystem keeps changing a lot. For example the industry was happy to adopt React even though it introduces breaking changes with major version updates.
  
What are your takes on this matter? Is feature churn that much higher in Scala? Has language instability been discussed in your organization? Has it impacted any team&#x27;s decision to use or not use Scala? Will the introduction of LTS versions help Scala&#x27;s adoption grow in the long-term or will it just make library maintainers happier?

                              <span>Have you found any way to ignore selecting surrounding formatting characters like:
 *bold*
 &#x3D;code&#x3D;
 ~highlight~
 By default selection seems to include them even when they are toggled off (not shown) in the buffer. Copying such small portions of text frequently to the clipboard can get a bit annoying after a while.
 If you are using evil mode (vim keybindings) key combination v i W will select the entire word and those surrounding characters. It would be nice to find some way to avoid this.

                              <span>Different &quot;flavors&quot; of this question has been asked already:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423127/how-to-view-the-next-days-in-org-modes-agenda
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12517/how-do-i-make-the-timespan-shown-by-org-agenda-start-yesterday
 But this question is about &quot;scrolling&quot; aka &quot;moving agenda view up or down&quot; by adding previous or subsequent days to the view.
 You can change org-agenda-start-day variable, but I&#x27;m not sure how to &quot;regenerate&quot; the view then? There also doesn&#x27;t seem to be an equivalent &quot;org-agenda-end-day&quot;? Perhaps someone knows a better way to approach this?
 SOLUTION: If you are using doom emacs you can &quot;scroll&quot; by showing previous/next &quot;period&quot; with square brackets ([ previous and ] next). Commands are called org-agenda-earlier and org-agenda-later (a bit hard to find).
 If someone still knew how to &quot;scroll&quot; by adding/removing earlier/later days in the current view that would be still very useful.

                              <span>Org-agenda allows you to delete and change scheduled items without opening the files (for example changing days by pressing shift+arrow keys), but changes are not saved to the files yet and get lost when you close the buffers.
 Is there a command to write all committed changes to the corresponding files?
 This question was addressed already on emacs stackexchange: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/477/how-do-i-automatically-save-org-mode-buffers
 The command is org-save-all-org-buffers and is bound by default to C-x C-s
 However what if you have some other org buffers opened that you didn&#x27;t mean to save when editing org-agenda items at the same time?
 Maybe there is something like org-save-all-org-agenda-buffer to only save the buffers edited in org-agenda?

 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/pfro6swpqq6b1.png?width&#x3D;36&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;65a3bbf2d08af6fcad8d47960e224f488f3b2d00
 It is a simple SVG with a number in it. The SVG file looks something like this:
     6   ...   
 I can load it in purescript Halogen:
 import Halogen.HTML import Halogen.Svg.Elements import Halogen.Svg.Attributes loadImage :: forall w i. HTML w i loadImage &#x3D; image [x 0.0, y 0.0, width 36.0, height 36.0, href &quot;assets/my_image.svg&quot;] 
 How can I programmatically change the number &quot;6&quot; in it? Can I modify the VDom in the HTML w i? Any other method? Thanks

                              <span>Hey, the following question might seem pretty silly and unimportant, but I&#x27;m a freak so seriously value something like this. I&#x27;m running on a really powerful desktop setup rn with a 165 Hz referesh rate monitor and right now I am stuck between the choice of Neovim and Doom Emacs for my preferred choice of text editor/productivity program. I really really like the integrated environment and the raw amount of power that Emacs provides, and features like Org mode especially are enticing. I&#x27;ve tried emulating the org-mode experience in Neovim with Neorg but it&#x27;s honestly pitiful in comparison, at least at the very moment. However, the biggest thing that bugs me with Emacs compared to Vim right now is just speed.
 Now, I&#x27;m not talking about startup speed. I know about the Emacs --daemon and Ema…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;m interested in creating forms using org-mode where information entered beneath each heading can be saved to an sqlite database, with each org-mode heading being the column heading for the sql table.
 I am using the emacsql package for saving the information to the database, and so long as the entries are placed in a vector, an emacsql function will be able to save the entries to the sql table.
 With the help of chatgpt, I&#x27;ve found several ways of parsing the org-mode headers and saving the entries within each header to a vector. When I display the vector in emacs, the entries look exactly as I would expect.
 However, when I save them to the database, each entry not only includes the text that I want, but a bunch of elisp code around it that appears to be coding the relative position of the text within the org file. It&#x27;s as if the text has a bunch of Metadata attached to it that is invisible within emacs but becomes visible when taken out of emacs and put into the database. I&#x27;ve tried many different ways but all end with the same outcome.
 It&#x27;s clear that there&#x27;s a problem with the methods im using, so I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has been able to successfully do something like this before or has some suggestions as to why this is happening and how to fix it. Thanks!

                              <span>Star buffers are sometimes useful but I almost never need them and see them as clutter. Consult makes it really easy to modify and add sources. Here how to put star buffers out of mind but still include them in the buffer list by putting them at the bottom of your buffers list when using consult-buffer. This example removes star buffers from the main buffer source and creates a new source for them.
 (defvar consult--source-star (list :name &quot;*Star-Buffers*&quot; :category &#x27;buffer :narrow ?s :face &#x27;consult-buffer :history &#x27;buffer-name-history :state #&#x27;consult--buffer-state :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort &#x27;visibility :as #&#x27;buffer-name :include &#x27;(&quot;\\*.&quot;))))) ;; modify buffer source to exclude star sources (setq consult--source-buffer (plist-put consult--source-buffer :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort &#x27;visibility :as #&#x27;buffer-name :exclude &#x27;(&quot;\\*.&quot;))))) ;; reorder sources and add star source at the end (setq consult-buffer-sources &#x27;(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer consult--source-bookmark consult--source-recent-file consult--source-file-register consult--source-project-buffer-hidden consult--source-project-recent-file-hidden consult--source-star)) 
 If you truly want to hide them you can use :hidden per the documentation https://github.com/minad/consult#multiple-sources but I find putting them under recent files good enough.

                              <span>My configuration of Eglot is simple: (use-package eglot :hook (c-mode . eglot-ensure)). And it works for a single c file. But when I use this setup to read the code of NetHack, it doesn&#x27;t work for linting and definition finding (M-.), even though eglot connection has no problem. I observed the same problems when reading the code of SQLite. Some specific problems I observed:
 for #include &quot;hack.h&quot;
  
clang [pp_file_not_found]: &#x27;hack.h&#x27; file not found
  
for boolean known;
  
clang [unknown_typename]: Unknown type name &#x27;boolean&#x27;
  
I think the problem may be due to a mismatch of C version between the code and clangd. But how can I tell clangd to check a specific version of C (eg. C99)?
 (Edit) I just tried to use &#x60;c-ts-mode&#x60;, and for some reason the linting issues went away but I still cannot jump using (M-.).
 (Edit 2) It seems that the problems in SQLite source code went away when I use c-ts-mode.
 (Edit 3) Still have the following problem when I use (M-.) in NetHack code:
  
No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point

                              <span>Has anyone tried building Emacs for iPad by targeting WASM, which can run on the JavaScriptCore framework? Applications such as a-Shell already provide a terminal environment for running WASM binaries. Running Emacs locally on your iPad has many benefits compared to running it on a remote host.
 One of the challenges with cross-compiling Emacs is the dumping. Perhaps a way around that is to just use “temacs”, which avoids the dumping step.

                              <span>Recently, I tried to use Eglot + pyright on Django project.
 But pyright doesn&#x27;t works as expected, can not get completion on when import django.db.model
 Any one known how to make pyright works with Django?
 Steps to reproduce:
 ​
  
setup project
  
​
 mkdir django-project cd django-project python3 -m venv ./.venv .venv/bin/python3 -m pip install django source .venv/bin/activate django-admin startproject CoreRoot . django-admin startapp core python manage.py migrate python manage.py runserver 
  
Install Pyright
  
sudo npm install -g pyright
  
Install pyvenv for activate virtual environment in Emacs
 (use-package pyvenv :hook (python-mode . pyvenv-mode) :config (setq pyvenv-post-activate-hooks (list (lambda () (setq python-shell-interpreter (concat pyvenv-virtual-env (if (eq system-type &#x27;windows-nt) &quot;scripts/python&quot; &quot;bin/python&quot;)))))))
 
Start Emacs and open the file: django-project/core/models.py
 
M-x pyvenv-activate and choose the .venv directory
 
M-x eglot, and choose pyright-langserver
 
Try some example code in django-project/core/models.py as below:
 from django.db import models
 class Person(models.Model): first_name &#x3D; models.CharField(max_length&#x3D;30) last_name &#x3D; models.CharField(max_length&#x3D;30)
 
You find that you can&#x27;t get completion for &quot;CharField&quot;, see pictures as below:
 
 ​
 can get models
 ​
 Can not get CharField
 ​
 9 . I also tried python-language-server(pylsp), it can get completion but the server is a little slow, I can feel delay while input characters.
 ​
 works as expected with pylsp
 You can test with this example project: https://github.com/Eason0210/django-project.git
 My personal Emacs config: https://github.com/Eason0210/.emacs.d
 my Emacs version:
 GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin22.5.0, NS appkit-2299.60 Version 13.4 (Build 22F66), git sha1 8657afac774) of 2023-06-16

                              <span>Recently I have been doing some programming in python. I have got it working nicely in Emacs - I may share my configuration another time.
 I&#x27;m have a problem with imports though. In Python you bring in a library by &quot;importing&quot; it. I often have to edit libraries that are part of the project I&#x27;m working on. The problem is that in Python 3 you can&#x27;t unload a library, nor can you replace it with a newer version.
 This is a problem because Emacs python-mode is based around the idea of sending python code to a python shell. This works fine unless imports get involved. Once imports get involved you run into the problem that python will never re-import a library after it has imported it once. So, if you&#x27;re editing a library the only way to update to the new version (which could be what you just wrote) is to stop the python process and start another one.
 Is there a fix for this? Has anyone written a package to at least make constantly restarting python more convenient?

 So far, this has been working great -- until I had to write template implementation files:
 Refresher: 
  
In non-templated C++, #include &quot;header.hpp&quot; goes at start of implementation.cpp file.
 
In templated C++, #include &quot;implementation.tpp&quot; goes at end of header.hpp file. 
 
 Basically, since implementation.tpp doesn&#x27;t explicitly &quot;include&quot; its header definitions, the LSP thinks I am just writing out things without defining them, resulting in a bunch of squiggly lines.
 I know a lot of people just put their template implementation code in the header file, but I really want to keep it separate. Have any C++ users encountered this problem before and found a solution? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 I&#x27;m new to ZIO and currently exploring the concepts of ZIO environment, ZLayers, and ZEnvironment. As I delve into the ZIO documentation and source code, I feel like I&#x27;m missing a few pieces to fully grasp how they fit together. I&#x27;d greatly appreciate your insights in helping me form a complete picture.
 ​
 In the &#x60;ZIO[R, E, A]&#x60; effect, the type parameter &#x60;R&#x60; is referred to as the environment type or the ZIO environment of type &#x60;R&#x60;. The ZIO environment can be constructed by composing ZLayers. By using accessor methods provided by the ZIO datatype, we can access the ZIO environment of a specific type to execute the effect.
 ​
 Here&#x27;s where I am seeking clarification: Is it correct to say that ZIO constructs the ZIO environment of the required type &#x60;R&#x60; from the ZIO environment built by composing the layers? The ZIO environment constructed from the layers will have a different type, but ZIO effects need a specific ZIO environment of a particular type.
 ​
 Furthermore, I am curious about the role of ZEnvironment in all of this. How does it fit into the overall picture?
 ​
 I am grateful for any insights or explanations you can provide to help me better understand these concepts and their interactions.
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

You can do it interactively with (delete-other-windows), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work from terminal: (progn (org-capture) (delete-other-windows)) .
 There were a few attempts to do it already in 2013:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15253005/in-emacs-org-mode-how-do-i-get-org-capture-to-open-in-a-full-sized-window
 in 2015:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21195327/emacs-force-org-mode-capture-buffer-to-open-in-a-new-window
 and in 2018:
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/46460/org-capture-frame-with-no-splits
 None of which seem to work in 2023 (doom) emacs. Has anyone by any chance recently configured this and would be kind enough to share it? Or are you using org-capture in a completely different way that skips this problem altogether? Or are you using some other package for quick note taking?

                              <span>Whenever I take a course, all the relevant material is spread across multiple platforms: Moodle, Microsoft Teams, personal websites, boards from the previous years...
 Every time I start a new course I have to navigate across all these pages and archive everything that I could possibly need: slides, assignments, exams from previous years, etc...
 However, there are a bunch of issues:
  
Storing everything in the file system is a mess: not everything can be stored as a file. Some things (like an online quiz) are meant to be stored as simple bookmarks. This heterogeneity breaks the purpose of &quot;having only one place to look at&quot; for me
 
Given &quot;exam-2-4-2005.pdf&quot;, I&#x27;d like to write some information related to it: whether i have already done it, and the solution. Sometimes the solution is on paper, so all I need to write is a simple number that corresponds to the page on my paper notebook.
 
 Using org mode, I can link both local files and Http URLs (also pdf pages!). I could also write notes related to each one of them.
 Does any of you have a similar workflow in your Emacs routine? Is there some suggestion or package that could aid me for this purpose? This is the first time I use org for something beyond note taking, so I really do not have any &quot;concrete&quot; idea on how to achieve all this.

                              <span>Has anyone seen any form of customization that allowed you to add a timestamp when creating next item in a list or new heading? For example:
  
[2023-06-17 14:21:23] This and that has been said...
 [2023-06-17 14:21:57] And then that other thing...
  
Yas snippet or org-time-stamp commands let you add a timestamp anywhere in the document, but it may get tedious with larger lists. Ideally there would be some way for a timestamp to be bound to the new item creation? Would you just add a yasnippet to a new keybinding (for example Ctrl+Shift+RET)? If anyone has such an example in their config I would really appreciate it.

                              <span>I m using Doom Emacs and am converting an existing program to an Org mode literate style format with a TOC etc. so as to make clear whats going on. When I insert headings code blocks are automatically indented - which is what I want - but white arrows appear for each indentation and these are overlayed with gray blocks (a bit like Visual blocks), which I don&#x27;t want. Nothing I have tried seems to get rid of either the arrows or the gray blocks. Is there some function that shuts this off as it&#x27;s visually really distracting? Thx in advance... 
 P.S. The white arrows might be difficult to see under the gray block but they are there sure enough!

                              <span>ChatGPT and I collaborated on a Visual Studio Code extension to display a list of markdown files by their H1 header. The extension is called Zettel View, and it contributes a Zettlr-like display of Zettels to the VS Code Explorer View, as shown below.

Clicking on any file in the Zettel View window opens the Zettel markdown file in an editor window and causes the file explorer to highlight the selected file.  Since I installed the &quot;Auto-Open Markdown Preview&quot; VS Code extension, the markdown preview of the selected Zettel also appears.
The Zettel View extension for VS Code is available on my GitHub account.
Zettel View makes some assumptions about Zettels. First, Zettels are markdown files with the extension .md. Second, a markdown file&#x27;s H1 or level-one header has the form # ID TITLE (the ID is to the left; some prefer the ID on the right). Third, ID matches a regular expression specific to my ID scheme. Fourth, ID.md is the filename of the Zettel markdown file with the header # ID TITLE.
The second and third assumptions are hard-coded but could be made configurable in later versions of the extension. The fourth assumption isn&#x27;t enforced: a mismatch between ID.md and the filename will appear as a discrepancy between the Zettel selected in the Zettel View and the file explorer. A warning will be emitted in that case.
Zettr has the built-in configuration setting, &quot;Display files using first heading level 1 if available.&quot; A community plugin for Obsidian called &quot;File Explorer Markdown Titles&quot; once produced a similar display in the Obsidian file explorer. Unfortunately, that plugin no longer works with newer versions of Obsidian. Since VS Code is more valuable for my work than Obsidian, it made more sense to develop a VS Code extension than to modify the plugin to work with the current Obsidian API. I plan to move to VS Code the Pandoc and LaTeX integration I configured in Zettlr.</span>

 * TODO Task 1 * TODO Task 2 * TODO Task 3 
 After some time you complete these tasks and want to add new ones. Where do you add them? Do you add them to the same file? Do you create a new file after the first one gets too big? Do you manually perform clean up of the file every so often?
 It may be unrelated, but I&#x27;m wondering how do you add new entries? I imagine that if file gets really big opening and navigating it may get slow after some time. Do you have custom capture templates for that? Do you manually open that file navigate to the top or bottom and add entries there?
 There seems to be a lot of manual processes involved here, which I assume people have figured out how to automate already, but I can&#x27;t quite find out where.
 In org agenda calendar view there is some mention of a &quot;diary file&quot; - is that the place where these entries should be stored instead of organizing them manually?

                              <span>Hi,
 elisp noob here...
 I am setting a variable depending on the hostname and have this in my init.el:
 ;; here is code that sets mh/org-dir (setq org-agenda-files mh/org_dir) (cd mh/org_dir) 
 the cd works but when I try to open the agenda I get &quot;org-agenda-files cannot be a single directory&quot;.
 My question now: If you have the name of a directory in a variable: how do you add all the org-files in that directory to the agenda?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 in this blog post I wrote back in 2018, I had described how to set up a function for org-mode in EMACS, that allows you to take screenshots and include them in your org-file with just one move. An example application looks like this: GIF
 There is now a new version of the function with improved interface and functionality, you can find it in the post above, or directly in the gitlab repo. The corresponding snippet can be found here.
 Hope it helps, I&#x27;m looking forward to any kind of feedback.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Does anyone have this working, I want to use consult-ripgrep package and I guess the package offers a search mechanism for org files within OrgRoam directory..
 I am missing a search parameter using this config because key binding works but rg does not return anything because nothing was captured from typed-in string: Therefore ARG and OPTS must be replaced by something ? Otherwise 
 (use-package consult)
 (defun tomek/org-roam-rg-search ()
 &quot;Search org-roam directory using consult-ripgrep. With live-preview.&quot;
 (interactive)
 (let ((consult-ripgrep &quot;rg --null --ignore-case --type org --line-buffered --color&#x3D;always --max-columns&#x3D;500 --no-heading --line-number . -e ARG OPTS&quot;))
 (consult-ripgrep org-roam-directory)))
 ​
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c rr&quot;) &#x27;tomek/org-roam-rg-search)

 I hope you&#x27;re all having a great day. I&#x27;m a newbie to Emacs, and I&#x27;ve been doing some exploring to find the best fit for me. I started with Spacemacs, but to be honest, it felt overwhelming, and I couldn&#x27;t get all its spirit.
 Then, I gave Doom Emacs a shot, and I was simpler, yet it still seems to have all the functionality I need. For me, doom-emacs offers me a great experience, though. 
 That said, I have a minor concern. I noticed they released the last significant update back in March. More concerning, though, is that there seem to be quite a few unanswered pull requests, some of which appear to be pretty important in terms of features or fixes.
 So, in my complete ignorance, I first want to ask you guys experts about the situation. 
 Is Doom Emacs still being actively maintained? If not, what do you think is the best way, return to Spacemacs or try another configuration kit? 
 Thanks for your insights and suggestions. 
 Best.

                              <span>Hi guys! I want to export a certain company/project TODO list I am working on, to a CSV file, in order to produce a shareable ongoing progress report of my work onlne. I&#x27;ve gotten the Emacs built in macro org-batch-agenda-csv working somewhat using a command like this:
 (org-batch-agenda-csv &quot;MYTAG1|MYTAG2&quot;)
 Where I&#x27;m struggling is with date/time information. I assumed that if my TODOs have a typical SCHEDULED attribute that i&#x27;d easily discover date/time info in the generated csv. So far, no such luck.
 The help for org-batch-agenda-csv macro talks about optional (rest) Parameters that &quot;are alternating variable names and values that will be bound before running the agenda command.&quot; This sounds extremely useful but I&#x27;m not sure how to proceed without perhaps examples of how these could be used for some typical uses.
 There are also a handful of references to date/time things in both the Emacs online help for the macro, and in the elisp macro definition. I am not an Emacs Lisp expert though and so far my randomish trial and error has gone nowhere.
 Can you help?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Crossposting from github, because the response rate there has been pretty slow: https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server/discussions/730
 So,
 I&#x27;m writing an application using vanilla js + WebGL and my development stack is:
  
emacs
 lsp-mode
 company-mode
 ts-ls installed through emacs
  
My LSP config is here, and I&#x27;m open to suggestions for improving it.
 Completion works fine for the core parts of javascript, e.g. getElementByID() and friends. But if I want to call into, let&#x27;s say, the canvas API, I don&#x27;t have completion working. Here&#x27;s an example:
 var canvas &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;foo&quot;); var ctx &#x3D; canvas.getContext(&quot;bar&quot;); 
 screenshot
 Note how the getContext isn&#x27;t offered by the language server as a completion option.
 Here&#x27;s a second example:
 xmlr &#x3D; new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlr.open(&#x27;GET&#x27;, url, false); 
 Similarly, the open isn&#x27;t offered as a completion option.
 How do I fix this? I&#x27;ve tried setting both a tsconfig.json and a jsconfig.json with the following contents:
 { &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: { &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es2020&quot;, &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;es2020&quot;], &quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot; } } 
 But no dice. I still don&#x27;t get completion in the examples above.
 What do?

                              <span>Today I finally found a few hours to implement 2 features from swiper that I missed in consult-line:
 ​
  
Smart recenter: buffer is recentered only if you jump to match outside of current view. (This can be done in a pretty non-invasive way via hooks)
 Highlighting of matches on all visible lines in buffer. This is a noticeable patch to core consult code. Instead of creating a patch/fork, I just put into a separate file which I load after consult itself, it redefines quite a few core functions. It might break with newer consult versions.
  
​
 Feel free to try: https://gist.github.com/lazy/4f609cf2b956de2531885747e3c3bf88
 Save it to &quot;consult-patch.el&quot; file, open in emacs, M-x eval-buffer, run consult-line, search for something like &quot;let&quot; and enjoy.
 ​
 UPD: gist was updated at least once. Overlay caching didn&#x27;t move overlays between windows. Now it doef.
 ​
 P.S. I saw another approach to doing that: https://github.com/minad/consult/pull/774. But minad decided not to merge it due to perf and personal preference. Mine is a little better performance-wise: it checks for highlighting only visible candidates and caches the highlight overlays (of which there can be many). But I am not sure if I will be able to overcome minad&#x27;s personal preference, so don&#x27;t want to bother with PR. If someone wants to polish this code and try merge into mainline, I won&#x27;t mind. Think of this code as &quot;public domain&quot;.
 P.P.S. I don&#x27;t use swiper because I have quite a lot of custom vertico/vertico-posframe/consult configuration which I do not want to replicate for swiper.

                              <span>Hello,
 I gave a quick run around the posts about emacs server/daemon and I have a couple of questions
  
If you don&#x27;t put any special arguments by default and you run emacs --daemon this will have a Unix socket right? Which means that both server and client will be on localhost.
 You can also specify a TCP socket allowing the server and the client to live on separate hosts. Is this right?
 Finally, if and when this happens when you edit files with emacsclient do you edit files on the client side or on the server side? Would this be a good use for editing files both on the server and the client? Or you should have something separate to edit files on the server? i.e. use git or ssh or nextcloud
  
Thank you very much for your help.

                              <span>I often browse though tweets using the nitter.net site, which is basically a scrape of the text and images on twitter.com. 
 Over the past month or so, images in tweets shown in nitter have stopped displaying in EWW, but can be seen on an external browser like Firefox. 
 For instance, in this tweet, there is a profile picture and an embedded .jpg image of a football/soccer player which both show up in Firefox. However, when viewed in EWW only the poster&#x27;s profile picture is shown. This is not the case for images that show up as &quot;previews&quot; of webpages, e.g. in this tweet, both the profile picture and the previewed image of aircraft from the article both show up in EWW.
 I thought this issue would explain why, but the images I see in Firefox are .jpg, not webp. This might still be a nitter issue, but I would be interested to understand why this has happened.

                              <span>I am starting a process via start-process-shell-command. The command starts server, and is actually never &quot;finished&quot; as the server is continuously running. However, one can infer when this command is finished, that is to say when the server is up and running, by looking at the output (i.e. when the string &quot;Server is running!&quot; is observed in the output).
 I want to code up an Elisp function that calls the command, wait until the server is up and running, and only then execute the next step. How would I best do this?
 My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).
 I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can&#x27;t figure out a way to &quot;wait&quot; until the regex pattern is observed via filters.
 Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?

 I will be deleting my profile so I also wanted to thank you all for the inspiration and for helping me to solve my problems in my Emacs journey.
 So, thank you all, my fellow Emacsers. &#x3D;]

                              <span>I haven’t really used emacs too much yet, but I love the idea of using it for taking notes and organizing my life with org mode. Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.
 The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.
 I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.
 After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 ​
 I am trying to generate a report from an org file with R code blocks.
 ​
 Blocks are defined such as:
 ​
 #+begin_src R :results output round(cov(phenmz1),3) #+end_src 
 ​
 And I have an option at the header:
 #+PROPERTY: exports both 
 Now, when I run org-html-export-to-html, code is run but the contents of the code block are substituted with nilbody.
 ​
 - What is likely the issue with this case?

                              <span>Given an org-file with visibility cycled such that certain sections are folded, how would one search and replace in the unfolded text only. E.g. in org file below, how would I do a search and replace on the lines Foo2 and Foo3 only?
 I&#x27;ve tried cycling visibility to show level one headers only and doing a visual selection of line Foo2 and Foo3 then using regexp-replace and :s/... but in both cases the replacement takes place on the folded lines under Foo2 and Foo3 too.
 * Foo1 ** Sub * Foo2 ** Sub * Foo3 ** Sub * Foo4 ** Sub 
 UPDATE Setting search-invisible to nil prior to the replacement, works as long as 1) I use regexp-replace, and 2) the search is for plain text (not a regexp) only. 
 If I search for $ then neither regexp-replace nor :substitute work.
 UPDATE 2 Oopsie, I predominantly use spacemacs

                              <span>Langchain significantly accelerates the development of large language models (LLMs). I&#x27;m curious if Scala can offer suitable implementations, based on its language features, to make the development of asynchronous streaming text applications easier, just like popular older Scala projects in the field of big data.
 AI and LLM have made Python great again; perhaps Scala can demonstrate its power in new domains.
 P.S. I&#x27;m currently working on a closed-source Java-lang project for our LLM project, built on Reactor. Just asking for fun.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s the 1.0.0 version of FxCalculator
 It&#x27;s, well, a calculator for your Android phone.
 It&#x27;s got all the usual buttons with numbers and operators, and also parentheses as well as buttons for storing the partial results of your calculations to the memory.
 But that&#x27;s not all. It also has an advanced editor hidden under the &quot;Fx&quot; button. In that mode, you can write an expression with your virtual keyboard, as if you were writing simple programming code. You can use variables and functions from a list, combine them, and even write your own custom ones. They will be stored on the phone so they can be actually useful to you more than once.
 And, on top of that, FxCalculator was written in Scala 3, with JavaFX, Gluon, and GraalVM Native Image. For now it&#x27;s available only as APK stored on GitHub. You can install it by allowing 3rd party APK installation on your Android, clicking the link above on your phone, and then downloading and installing the APK from there.
 I will try to push the app to the Google store and create a better looking webpage for it later this year.

                              <span>As a follow-up to this old thread, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Kreuzberg Library.
 The library&#x27;s primary purpose is to simplify the creation of declarative ScalaJS components.
 The concept is straightforward:
  
Components can subscribe to models, which contain some state.
 Components declare event bindings (e.g., click events) that, in turn, modify models.
 If a model changes, the components emit new HTML (including event bindings and sub-components).
 The new HTML gets rendered.
  
Additionally, Channels are included, which offer n:m communication and can be incorporated into event bindings (as sources and sinks).
 HTML rendering can be performed via Scalatags and Scala XML, but other mechanisms can also be implemented.
 The rendering engine can be changed. Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.
 A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.
 Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn&#x27;t entirely functional. I&#x27;ve experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on this.

                              <span>If you’re a Haskell developer, it’s likely you’re already familiar
with the concept of property-based testing, and have first hand
experience with a framework like QuickCheck or hedgehog. You might
also have heard of the term “fuzzing” in various places, and it sounds
just like what we’ve already been doing for so long, right? Just
generate a bunch of random test inputs, in the hope of exposing an
unknown bug?
Well, actually there’s more to it than that! Recently, I had some fun
exploring coverage-guided fuzzers like AFL++ and libFuzzer. Along
the way, I discovered a simple trick that allows us to compile Haskell
code in a manner that these fuzzers can handle. The experience was
akin to unlocking a hidden skill. I can say, without a doubt, that
coverage-guided fuzzing can work wonders. Thi…</span>

 When I open some.cfg in emacs, conf-mode is selected. But if I do M-x sh-mode after that, the sh-mode settings from .dir-locals.el are applied (the sh-basic-offset and fill-column).
 Why it ignores the auto-mode-alist clause? My emacs is from ubuntu 22.04 repositories, version 27.1+1-3ubuntu5.
 Yes, I tried starting it with the -q option, the behavior is the same.

                              <span>Is anyone familiar with this package? For whatever reason it seems to randomly stop working. Last night I reinstalled it and chose &#x27;bitmap&#x27; for the guides method and pleasantly got two dots for each line. Today it randomly stopped working though I&#x27;ve changed nothing in my configuration.
 At the moment I see i&#x27;m getting 1 row of dots and they&#x27;re coming in as black, randomly. Can someone point me in the right direction to get back to this?

                              <span>whenever I open emacs, it has some buffers from the previous session which sometimes may contain pdfs or large files that slow down the startup time, how to prevent that behavior ?
 I think it is due to some persp-mode configuration but I don&#x27;t know what variable it is

Tried lsp c++ that included helm and I &#x27;effin hated helm ... for the first 30 seconds. Then I tried it again - and after minor mental adjustments - I realize it&#x27;s the best addition to my toolkit in the past several years!!

                              <span>In a reddit discussion about alternatives to gnus I mentioned my approach: syncing email over IMAP to a local server and then using gnus with that.
 I was asked for details of the setup - I&#x27;ve now written it up at written it up.
 The write up covers the use of authinfo, mbsync, dovecot and gnus.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m new on Emacs and I&#x27;m trying to use Elixir with Emacs
 I installed the elixir-mode M-x package-install [RET] elixir-mode [RET]
 https://github.com/elixir-editors/emacs-elixir
 and added
 (load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa/elixir-mode-2.4.0/elixir-mode.el&quot;) (require &#x27;elixir-mode) 
 to ~/.emacs
 But elixir&#x27;s files are still in fundamental mode, I guess I&#x27;m missing something ?
 Thank you for your help :)
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you the problem is solving :)
 I added this in ~/.emacs
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) 
 and installed elixir-mode via M-x list-packages who created elixir-mode-20221017.2044 folder and now it&#x27;s working :)

                              <span>I released a first version of khalorg. It is an interface between org and khal cli calendar. I mainly use it to synchronise my outlook agenda with org by using: davmail + vdirsyncer + khal + khalorg. It sure is a niche but who knows, maybe it is useful to someone 😀. 
 I use org with neovim, instead of Emacs. So the package khalel was not useful for me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a custom quicksort method and I need it to be able to sort a sequence of any type, as long as the type has a &quot;&lt;&quot; operator (it is comparable). I would have thought this is something done commonly but I&#x27;m having issues. At first I made the method like so:
 partitionInPlace[A &lt;: Ordered[A]] (...
 But it turns out common AnyVal types such as Int and Double don&#x27;t extend Ordered, so that&#x27;s not suitable. They extend Ordering but that&#x27;s not quite the same and it seems silly to use a function such as &quot;gteq&quot; instead of a simple operator.
 I have a feeling the solution is some kind of implicit conversion? Please help, I&#x27;m kind of new to Scala and I&#x27;m sure this is a common issue.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;ve been programming in Java but wanted to try something new from the ecosystem and chose Scala. However, I&#x27;ve encountered a major problem. Sbt starts syncing my projects but never finishes. I even let it run for entire day and nothing happened.
 I&#x27;ve tried basic troubleshooting: reinstalling IntelliJ Idea (2023.1.2), running different versions of sbt ( 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.2, 1.7.3 ), reinstalling Scala (2.13.19 and 2.13.17), disabling Windows Defender, installing different JDKs (19, 17, 11, 1.8), removing .lock, file, checking logs - they are empty. I even upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 11.
 I know that Scala works better on Linux, but I tested a similar scenario on my friend&#x27;s Windows 10 laptop and it worked like a charm. 
 Here&#x27;s screenshot of my last attempt:
 https://preview.redd.it/28f2b7ajou5b1.png?width&#x3D;1232&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;30ef0f584998bae20641a352c08ee6307dcc70a3
 Honestly, i have no idea what else I can do. I&#x27;ve read through many GitHub issues for sbt and nothing has helped. Has anyone else encountered simillar problem? Any tips or suggestions on what I can do next would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I really like this language, and once a project is set up that&#x27;s fine. But setting up a project just to the point where you can write a simple hello world function trips me up for days. Is there somewhere that guides through this complex process so I can get started easier?

                              <span>I am in the midst of thinking about my overall workflow, may even setup a Linux box to use for work (right now on Mac).
 I&#x27;ve been using Obsidian for notes, it kinda works. But have been thinking about Org mode for a while now for both my personal notes and work notes.
 Generally, I&#x27;m assigned to a project/client for a period of time. I have thought about creating an org folder in home then a org/client for the client or project then something like: - meetings.org for meetings and calls - notes.org for client or project specific notes - tickets.org for any sort of ticketing system they use to help keep track of those without having to login to the ticket system.
 TODOs would of course roll up to Org Agenda.
 More general notes would be in the main Org file.
 Any tips or thoughts on how to manage a similar workflow? Open to ideas.
 I would setup some capture templates to make it easier to add data to these. Maybe even org-roam at some point.
 I would have to start small and expand as I go. Just working on thinking through the mental model. I plan to start working on reading the org manual, any other recommended resources would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, I have looked at the syntax of the org-mode table but I haven&#x27;t found a way to add percentage proportions on each field. For example assuming my table has 3 fields - name, assgn1, assgn2 and I want to sum the assignments (assgn1, assgn2) but each one has a different gravity, for example, assgn1 65% the other 35% so both sum to 100 but with different proportion. I have tried unsuccessfully, given my understanding but not with much luck: TBLFM: $5&#x3D;vsum($2/(100\*65)..$4/(100\*35))

 Unfortunately org-download doesn&#x27;t allow PDFs or other files. Anyone aware of a way to make drag-and-drop attachments work like org-download?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a working(!) org-capture extension for org-protocol. It&#x27;s Firefox-only at the moment but I&#x27;m happy to accept patches to support Chromium based browsers. I wrote it because none of the current extensions/bookmarklets were all that usable (security popups, no hotkeys, etc.).
 Features include:
  
Hotkeys. One for storing links, one for capturing the page (or selected text, if there&#x27;s a selected region).
 Context menu items for capturing: 
 A link to the current page, along with a description pulled from the page&#x27;s metadata.
 Selected text. Optionally, selections can be captured as HTML. You&#x27;ll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.
 Media (images, video, etc.). Media can be (optionally) downloaded (through your browser&#x27;s download manager) before capturing.
 
 A browser action button to perform some default action on click (can either store a link to the current page, or initiate a capture).
 Optionally, capturing a selection will capture the HTML itself. You&#x27;ll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.

                              <span>Hi, I am bit new to this JVM world started learning both Java and Scala. I mainly work in Python. I use pyspark alot but started look at Spark with scala. Every video I see of Java vs Scala, it always scala is functional language while Java is Object oriented. But as java is evolving it has added functional programming in java 8. Do you think there are some features it is lacking that scala has which java will add in future?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Does anyone know what are the closest alternatives to functional scala using cats effect or zio?
 Do any other languages (that companies hire for) allow the same effect driven monad\IO FP style? 
 From what I&#x27;ve seen, haskell is the closest alternative, but I was wondering if there are others I&#x27;m not aware of.
 I really like the style of developing that scala with cats effect\zio allows, but I think it might be a good idea to look into another language(s) that encourages this style\methodology too, in order to increase the amount of potential companies I can apply to. 
 Many thanks.

 Everything is in the title :) 
  
did you experimen with the feature ? 
 what do you think of it ? 
 any lib using them rn ? or example projet ? I would be extra interested in error handling examples 
  
I&#x27;ve started playing around with boundaries and breaks for the fun of it with the objective of implementing an async/await ( but I guess dotty-cps-async existing and looking great kinda killed my motivation ^^ ) and making scala more Rust-like with Result and &quot;nice&quot; ( all a matter of perspective folks, don&#x27;t burn me to the stakes yet ) overloadings with .? and .! . Very rough right now though
 I&#x27;d welcome any suggestion if you have a lookt at mine, and would very much like to see yours !

                              <span>Hi all,
 against my expectations, I have oauth2ms working in retrieving my mails using mbsync. After much finagling it works as advertised. But msmtp, not so much. I can send mails via thunderbird and k9 using office365 smtp and oauth , but msmtp says no.
 Does anybody have some tips to throw ny way perhaps ?
 thx. S
 edit: yes, yes it is possible:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; defaults tls on tls_starttls on logfile ~/.cache/msmtp.log
 account mymail host smtp.office365.com user xxx@xxx from xxx@xxx tls_certcheck on auth xoauth2 passwordeval &quot;oauth2ms -e xxx@xxx&quot; port 587 tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 turns out, I had the token stored with encryption and forgot to add the -e xxx@xxx argument....

                              <span>Today I watched a video where it looked like the youtuber was using XEmacs (it was not the topic of the video, so it wasn&#x27;t mentioned), so I went to XEmacs site to see if there had been any updates, and it turns out, there was a release around a month ago!
 I had used XEmacs in the early 2000s, before Emacs 21 or 22, don&#x27;t remember. But one of the things I liked more, was that help buffers and other popup windows, get focused straight away, so they are easier to navigate and to close, just by using the normal movement keys and q. I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.
 After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs. I&#x27;ve been doing that for more than 20 years.
 Well, from the XEmacs changelog: 
  
Improve: Help buffer behaviour synced with GNU (Mats Lidell)
  
I laughed so hard :D

 I am wrassling with outlook365 and I want to move from thunderbird to mu4e and I have finally been able to get mbsync to login and download the mails. However, with thunderbird I have set up an Archives/[YEAR] subfolders structure that I have used for years with my personal mail that also works as advertised in mu4e.
 But with outook365 I get :
 IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2022 (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2023 (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/Birthdays (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/United States holidays (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) 
 Which I thought/expected to be flattened into Archives.2022 like in my personal setup.
 This is the relevan mbsynrc snippet: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; IMAPStore outlook-remote Account xxxxxx PathDelimiter &quot;.&quot;
 MaildirStore outlook-local Path ~/Mail/outlook/ #trailing / is important ! Inbox ~/Mail/outlook/INBOX
 Flatten &quot;.&quot;
 Subfolders Verbatim
 InfoDelimiter &quot;_&quot;
 Channel outlook Far :outlook-remote: Near :outlook-local: Patterns * INBOX* Create Near Expunge Near SyncState * Sync All &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Does anybody have some tips or tricks up their sleeve perhaps ?
 thx S

                              <span>I previously used Ubuntu and loved the Tlwg Typewriter Bold font on it. I had it as my code and general font for emacs since it was appealing for both purposes. Unfortunately MacOs - which I switched to recently - does not support this font. 
 I currently use Monospace Bold and am quite happy with it. But I looked at a font recently on another post here , and liked that as well (image below). Can someone tell me which font that is? And also, if you have any suggestions based on my taste above, please recommend me fonts to try out (if possible with the lisp code on your init.el so that its easy for me).
 P.S. I also like the red code font used on reddit here

                              <span>Tiki Tech is an open source Haskell simulation of (association) football.
 It begins from first principles, i.e. the motion of the players and the ball rather than from some existing statistical analysis of football. The idea is instead to work backwards from those statistical models and tweak the physical parameters until something approximating the real game of football emerges. I hope that this approach sets the simulation up for success as the application of data and analysis to football evolves and better statistical measures of success become increasingly available.
 Motivation
 There are clearly a number of existing football simulation games that are wildly more advanced and capable than this simple hobby project. The closed source and commercial nature of these alternatives makes f…</span>

It shows notes created each month—a fascinating look at how time has impacted zettelkasting. I&#x27;m into quantitative analysis, and this was fun learning a few tricks in Python.
If your Zk is file-based, uses a UID as part of the file name, like 202306XXX..., and you have Python and dependencies installed; it should work for you.

 New in this issue:
 - support for boundary/break API, which was introduced in Scala-3.3.0
 - changed API for custom monad contexts -- now monad context should provide an instance of monad with possible intercepted operations instead await interceptor. This is needed for unification with context-encoded direct style, where we can have no await-s. [And last relative significant change, for which we had kept the &#x27;0.x&#x27; versioning scheme].

                              <span>I have a solid understanding of how Behaviors works, the actor hierarchy and so on. 
 As part of my Master thesis, I would like study some of Akka&#x27;s internals, i.e. the code machinery that allow actors and Behaviors to work.
 I am aware of the Actor Architecture&#x27;s documentation, but I am looking for something different:
  
What are the most important components that allow an actor to come into existence and communicate with others? How do these components interact?
 When an actor does a tell, what components does the message go through until the receiving side processes it?
  
I examined the source code a bit; my understanding is that the ActorCell class is crucial; however, being an implementation component that is not to be touched by users directly, it is not covered by the user documentation. Similar reasoning for the ActorRefProvider class.
 Up until now I have found this resource (it provides a very useful component diagram); I am looking for similar resources, and possibly more comprehensive ones.
 Any resource would be helpful (even conference talks). Thanks for your inputs.

                              <span>I want the content of my src blocks to align with the #+ of the begin/end lines of the block. If I am under a list item, this does not happen. What I want is...
 - List item #+begin_src emacs-lisp (message &quot;correct&quot;) #+end_src 
 But what I get instead is...
 - List item #+begin_src emacs-lisp (message &quot;incorrect&quot;) #+end_src 
 I have org-src-preserve-indentation set to t because to get the proper alignment of my code when writing it, but I figure that it also causes the misalignment of the src contents w/ respect to the begin/end delimiters. Does anyone know of an easy fix for this issue? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit. More background information here. The recent &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session with the CEO of Reddit didn&#x27;t really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.
 I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?
 I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.

                              <span>I messed with my Emacs config recently and uninstalled some Clojure-related packages (clojure-mode, clojure-mode-extra-font-locking, cider) from a couple of years ago. I decided I wanted to explore Clojure again but now, when I run cider-jack-in, if I type an expression and hit Enter, it just creates newlines repeatedly, but does not evaluate.
 I have tried some troubleshooting steps, but have not had any success. What I&#x27;ve tried so far is:
  
Clear out ~/.emacs.d/elpa and let the packages install fresh.
 Upgrade leiningen (with brew on macOS), start a new Clojure project and core.clj file and try to jack in to that. (Has the same behavior.)
 Enabled logging for nrepl-server. No errors are logged.
  
Interestingly, if I run C-x C-e next to an expression in core.clj, it evaluates normally, but the REPL no longer works.
 Could you please suggest more troubleshooting steps or a possible fix? I am running EmacsforOSX version 28.2. I searched the web but have not yet found someone who encountered this same problem.
 EDIT: formatting.

                              <span>Hi folks, 
 I found the following in Section 16.10 of the Emacs Lisp Info Manual for Emacs 28.2: 
 &quot;Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use with-eval-after-load. If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded.&quot;
 Some obvious exceptions to setting variables &quot;immediately&quot; spring to mind, such as modifying a library&#x27;s keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don&#x27;t doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, &quot;Normally . . .&quot; 
 But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? 
 It seems to me that it&#x27;s safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter &quot;don&#x27;t bother waiting&quot; approach that I&#x27;m missing? 
 This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!

                              <span>Has anyone managed to get the android port working with distros like Doom? I&#x27;m currently using termux, which is very close to perfect as it is, except that it doesn&#x27;t do graphical stuff like embedded images in org files.
 Documentation on the native android port is hard to find; searching tends to give me decades old stack overflow questions and lots of info about termux.
 Are there good docs about configuring the Android port?
 Maybe the ideal at this point would be just to be able to point the native port to the .emacs.d I have already set up in termux, if there&#x27;s a way to do that?

 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using Debian-stable, known for its reliability. However, packages in the Debian repository tend to become outdated over time. Therefore, I chose to download the Emacs source tarball and compile it myself, which was successful. Recently, I came across the Guix package manager, which can be installed on Debian. Based on my research, guix install emacs installs Emacs in its own environment without requiring sudo access. This approach seems to reduce the likelihood of future dependency issues and makes package management easier. Is my understanding correct?
 I also observed that GUIX installed a daemon of some sort. I&#x27;m curious if this daemon consumes a significant amount of memory, considering it runs in the background continuously.
 Is it possible to install Emacs using GUIX while allowing the management of other packages to be handled by &quot;use-package&quot; as in my old configuration?

                              <span>In my setup I use a file for each &quot;project&quot; i.e.
  
Tasks - personal tasks
 Work - for work tasks
 Config - for tasks related to updating my config
 Game Design - tabletop game design tasks
 Programming Study - for learning / growing my programming knowledge
  
You get the idea. Each of these have a filetag so that everything is tagged and I have use categories for top level task types i.e. tasks/meetings/reminders etc (this lets me use category icons)
 The issue I have is for negative filtering. Say I want to filter out JUST my work and config tasks for say the weekend when I can work on a variety of personal projects.
 The documentation (here) states:
 C-u / Hide entries matching a tag. You can successively call this command to hide several tags. 
 If I call this and use Work it filters out work options. I call it again and the prompt is pre-filled with the text &quot;-work&quot; if i change it to &quot;config&quot; then work comes back. So I though maybe it should be &quot;-work-config&quot; when i do this it removes config but brings back work. I&#x27;m at a complete loss on how to apply multiple negative filters.
 I&#x27;ve also tried using \ for the Tag filter only mode not the more universal / filter. There same thing if I exclude work and run \ again and exclude config it brings work back
