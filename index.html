                              <span>Small example:
 type family XXE k f data EF a f &#x3D; VarF Int | AbsF Int f | XE !(XXE a f) type E0 &#x3D; Fix (EF S0) data S0 type instance XXE S0 f &#x3D; f 
 To use cata :: Functor f &#x3D;&gt; (f a -&gt; a) -&gt; Fix f -&gt; a with f ~ E0 S0 I will need to implement a functor instance like so:
 instance Functor (EF S0) where fmap f &#x3D; \case VarF n -&gt; VarF n AbsF n x -&gt; AbsF n (f x) XE xe -&gt; XE (f xe) 
 However, this is a bit cumbersome. Is there a way to define something like
 instance ??? &#x3D;&gt; Functor (EF a) 
 ?
 For this case it seems XXE a f ~ f should work but it does not. Now, what happens if I want an instance covering both E0 and E1 with type instance S1 f &#x3D; Maybe f or similar? I guess I would want something like instance Functor (XXE a) for the general case?
 Is there a way to get this to work? Maybe can I have a higher-kinded type family such that I can use type instance XXE S0 &#x3D; Identity?

                              <span>microlens is a tiny van Laarhoven lenses library, mostly just copying definitions from lens and trying to avoid dependencies as much as possible. It has gained some popularity over the years — 742 package downloads in the last 30 days, vs the 1724 of the original lens.
 I have decided to pass the maintainership of microlens. Mostly it&#x27;s just compatibility fixes — either backporting something from lens, or adjusting to new GHC releases. Please write at [artyom@monadfix.com](mailto:artyom@monadfix.com) if you are interested in becoming the new maintainer!

                              <span>Greetings all! I am brand new to this subReddit, not to mention Reddit in general. If anyone here has the time and the will to lend an ear (or an eye) to my plight and provide me with some much-needed advice, I&#x27;d be mostly greatly appreciative:
 ​
 As the title says, I am coming up to the final segments of HPFFP (currently on parser combinators/monad transformers), and I am trying to discern the path forward after finishing this book. 
 Now, here&#x27;s the caveat: I am NOT a career software developer. This has actually been my first real deep dive into computer programming in general (*prior to getting into Haskell, I had finished the HTML/CSS/Javascript certifications on FreeCodeCamp, but Haskell blossomed into a total love affair beyond my control). 
 So, most advice I see online about what to do after finishing HPFFP could be more-or-less distilled down to &quot;just get your hands dirty writing code in Haskell.&quot; But, I feel like the implicit assumption there is that the person receiving the advice already has a decent amount of experience writing computer programs. As for myself, I really have no clue about where to go next; I really enjoyed learning about how all of the concepts from category theory map onto the language (e.g. writing Monoid/Functor/Applicative/Monad instances for custom datatypes and whatnot), but at this point, it&#x27;s really just pure intellectual enjoyment - like solving a challenging puzzle or something like that. 
 It occurred to me that the natural thing to do would be to try to use Haskell for web development, and I have been eyeballing the Yesod book published by O&#x27;Reilly. But, would a book like that already assume that I&#x27;ve done backend development in another language before? If so, are there better resources available in this particular domain? Or, am I just not really ready to start actually using Haskell to accomplish something practical yet?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried my best to do my Python code as closely to a functional style as possible, however I&#x27;m still not quite confident about if the tail-recursion approach is appropriately written.
 Python code here:

 I&#x27;m mainly stuck on the conditional check for error which requires carrying out the relatively expensive operation. The way it is written here ends up computing the same result twice for each recursion, is there any syntax in Haskell that lets me reuse the result and still get tail-call optimization?

 Is there an easier way to navgiate to the last closing paren of the sexp to evaluate it?
 I came up with this, to naviget to the first closing paren, but apparently it does not accomplish what I need:
  (defun ugt-eval-last-sexp () &quot;Eval last sexp and save result to kill-ring.&quot; (interactive) (let (result) (search-forward &quot;)&quot;) ;; (forward-sexp) does not work for nested sexps (setq result (eval-last-sexp nil)) (message (format &quot;Evaluated to: %s&quot; result)))) (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map (kbd &quot;s-e&quot;) &#x27;ugt-eval-last-sexp)

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s a question as old as time but I&#x27;ve never used either and I&#x27;ve been reading other posts on this and I&#x27;m still pretty fuzzy.
 I understand the main complaint about emacs from vimmers is that it&#x27;s too slow and not quite as responsive as vim, whereas the apparent advantage of emacs is that it&#x27;s &quot;more&quot; than just an editor and this is where I get lost.
 I&#x27;ve read that emacs has integrated email, browser, calendar, calculator... games? I mean, honest question - who cares? No, really, I&#x27;m curious; perhaps there&#x27;s an answer I&#x27;m just not aware of. How often do you use the cal, calc, and email apps in emacs in your workflow.
 Then as far as more killer emacs apps like Magit, to borrow a phrase, &quot;there&#x27;s an app: plugin for that&quot; in neovim: https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit
 What functionality does emacs offer that simply can&#x27;t be implemented as a neovim plugin? Or perhaps that can&#x27;t be implemented nearly as nicely?
 Thanks, and sorry for the nth emacs v. vim question that I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re all sick of.

 This results in repeated SSH connection attempts which in this case has resulted in fail2ban locking me out the server for a set duration.
 Is there some way to disable this behaviour? It should be able to distinguish a remote server from a local one and not attempt to connect to the remote unless requested eg C-c C-c.

This Week
I&#x27;ve got an itch. Stealing @Loni&#x27;s Word Definition Deep Dive and I&#x27;ve applied it in principle to defining &quot;Cognition.&quot; I&#x27;m first exploring external sources for definitions and synonyms. Then I&#x27;ll search my ZK for connections, which I expect to be many. Probably the most fun/work, the next stage will be to think of metaphors to fit with the note. I&#x27;m calling this a #definition-map.
Class is over, and I have a little freedom for reading and have picked up, Metaphors We Live By by George Lakoff and Mark Leonard Johnson.
Trivia.
I&#x27;m thinking about when The Archive might become natively scriptable and what that will mean.</span>

                              <span>Dear fellow Zettlers,
This is my first post on the forum, though I’ve been reading and benefiting from your comments and inputs for over four years now: thank you for that!
My name is Erik, I’m an academic in the field of strategy, technology and innovation management. I have two Zettelkasten in The Archive, one for academic and more general non-fiction work (around 1400 notes) and one for fiction work (around 1450 notes).
The question I have for you is about déjà-vu in your ZK. I very regularly make new notes, only to discover, either when I add them to the ZK or much later, that I already made almost the same note at an earlier date.
Does this happen to you? Do you see it as a problem, or as a sign that the topic is important to you? If you notice such double entries, do you not enter the new note, do you merge them, or do you enter the new note specifically as ‘alternative’ to the other one?
Any other insights are also welcome.</span>

 What is making the border show like that?

 Is there some way to accomplish this. I don&#x27;t need the #+RESULTS header.
 I think there is a way of doing this that I&#x27;ve forgotten about.

                              <span>Hi, 
 General problem: I&#x27;m trying to create a hook which fires every time a buffer with a certain name is created. Is it a good idea to add it to buffer-list-update-hook?
 Specifically: The buffer is created by imenu-list (an awesome-sauce package for those who work with deep-nested org files), and I&#x27;d like to hide the modeline for this buffer. Adding a hook to imenu-list-major-mode-hook does not seem to do the trick. Any ideas how this could be done?
 Cheers!

                              <span>I am trying to run Emacs 28.1 in my Windows 10 Workstation. When loading the .emacs file, it is throwing a warning.
 ​
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘c:/Users/sreekumar /AppData/Roaming/.emacs’: error: :pre-build command error in &quot;org&quot; recipe (error &quot;Failed to parse ORGVERSION&quot;) 
 When searched in web , I found in the GNU error page that this can be avoided by putting an hyphen in front of recipe. I am not sure about this. Below is the part of my init file.
 (straight-use-package &#x27;use-package) ;; trying to install org-roam using straight (straight-use-package &#x27;org-roam) ;; error throws here. (straight-use-package &#x27;org-ref) (straight-use-package &#x27;deft) ... ... 
 The messages buffer shows like this.
 Building straight...done Building use-package... Building use-package → Building bind-key...done Building use-package...done Building org-roam...done Building org-ref... Building org-ref → Building org... For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a. \*\*\* Emacs loaded in 26.24 seconds with 4 garbage collections. 
 I appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read the topic about Emacs being a user friendly and how it&#x27;s userbase is low compared to vim (3% to 25%). I know Emacs is a powrful tool, I use it org on my phone, dired, its shell, vterm, etc. But, I got to this point because when I, 6 years ago, migrated from Windows, wanted to have all my tools to be open-source. To get the basic functionality on Emacs, like select, copy, paste, you have to learn its special keybindings. I know you do that in vi/vim too. But, focus on Emacs being friendly and then users being able to explore lisp and expand their configuration. Make Emacs a &#x27;bait&#x27;, kind-of mentality. 
 There are a lot of starter configs, but none currently compares itself to an modern IDE, doesn&#x27;t make org-mode feel like Typora or some paid/closed application, but Emacs has the potential. 
 The last point made, I know there are, at least brought up in the discussion, how the GUI app was made and how it functions, that makes it limited in many aspects. We have hooks, like after-change-major-mode-hook, so we can have diffrent UI depending on the major mode (one for org, python, c, etc), and get inspiration from ides. 
 And, lastly, all of this together, except for the architeture for the GUI, may make users think that Emacs got lost somewhere. We all know that we love Emacs because it can be what we want. All of us got an all white screen and made it ours, behave like we wanted. How enabling cua-mode(brought up inthe discussion) can change this? Imo, users simply would have a better start in UI, but get all the expandability that Emacs has.
 ​
 Anyway. I did some lisp to get my functions, I write my articles in org, but have no time to thinkering about it.

After some research, Seafile appeared to be the best choice for synchronizing notes, since I can&#x27;t trust Dropbox anymore and want to keep everything hosted in servers I can control. It has the particular advantage of supporting  WebDAV natively (thus it works with 1Writer) and being easy to set up.
I also did some tests with emacs running with a GUI using TigerVNC + Screens for iOS:  the performance is better than expected, even when running at full Retina resolution.  Terminal mode with Blink.sh provides a better general experience though.
I still didn&#x27;t make BerryLan play nicely to configure the Wi-Fi through Bluetooth (I&#x27;m not sure if it is supposed to be compatible with Tailscale). Maybe writing a client/server BT application with Pythonista?</span>

                              <span>It sometimes feels to me like there are two types of Haskell jobs:
  
Mundane Haskell. Parsing data, reading and writing to and from files and databases, and so on. A normal software development job. That&#x27;s something I can do.
 Advanced Haskell. Reserved for the cream of the crop, not just 1% of developers, but 1% of Haskell developers. Keywords like &quot;proof&quot;, &quot;verification&quot;, &quot;logic&quot;, etc. come up. I have no idea what these are (they might as well be speaking Chinese to me).
  
I&#x27;d appreciate your thoughts here.

                              <span>Hi Everyone! I&#x27;m building a websocket server for a collaborative document editor in Haskell, as a hobby project. Right now I am getting it to work with just two client connections, but I would like to make that scale very soon.
 I&#x27;m mainly using jaspervdj&#x27;s websocket library, which I will then serve with wai/warp. The jaspervdj&#x27;s chat server tutorial forks a new process for every client connection, and have it serve that connection until it is closed, which I don&#x27;t think would be as concurrent as I would like it to be. Ideally, I would like to have a way to
  
multiplex sockets (like select() from C), so that I only fork to serve connections that actually have messages arrived.
 or go through sockets in a round-robin fashion, skipping the ones that do are not ready.
  
I&#x27;m having trouble finding a way to do this; mainly, I&#x27;m not sure how to check if a client connection has messages ready. My main concern is that receiveData is blocking (according to the docs), so there is no way to skip msg &lt;- receiveData conn if it has to wait because it hasn&#x27;t received anything yet.
 What would be the ideal/scalable way in Haskell for handling potentially a large number of long-running websocket connections?

                              <span>Hello:
 I&#x27;m fairly new to elisp, but I&#x27;m trying to customize the text inside a &quot;begin_comment&quot; block in orgmode, as seen in the screenshot here
 I would like to have the same type of face as the code above (no colors).
 This is my config:
  (custom-theme-set-faces &#x27;user &#x27;(org-block ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch)))) &#x27;(org-document-info ((t (:foreground &quot;dark orange&quot;)))) &#x27;(org-document-info-keyword ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))) &#x27;(org-link ((t (:foreground &quot;royal blue&quot; :underline t)))) &#x27;(org-meta-line ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))))) &#x27;(org-property-value ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))) t) &#x27;(org-special-keyword ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch))))) &#x27;(org-tag ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch) :weight bold :height 0.8)))) &#x27;(org-verbatim ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))) &#x27;(org-indent ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch))))) &#x27;(org-table ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch))))) ;; check if this works &#x27;(org-comment ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch) :height 0.8)))) ) 
 As you can see at the end of the block, I tried the &quot;org-comment&quot; keyword there, but it does not appear in any documentation or configuration anywhere. Is there any way to configure that, or a place I can look for any documentation?
 Thanks for your help!

 I know I can redefine the functions and add spaces to the each side of the text, but I wonder if there&#x27;s a better way. Any suggestions?
 Thanks!
 Image to help understanding: https://i.imgur.com/PkfasEZ.png - I added spaces around the title in the last tab (&quot; Thanks &quot;).

 (add-hook &#x27;gdb-mode-hook (lambda() (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-x C-a C-s&quot;)))) (add-hook &#x27;gdb-mode-hook (lambda() (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-s&quot;)))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When I eval-region and restart my gud-gdb session I still get the default behavior. What am I doing wrong?

 Hey org-mode fans,
 In this post we saw that we can open org-mode links everywhere, not only in org-mode buffers, thanks to the command org-open-at-point-global.
 Specifically, we demonstrated it with:
  
the link [[help:pcase]] which links to the help buffer describing the macro pcase and,
 the link [[info:elisp#Current Buffer]] which to the elisp info node &quot;Current Buffer&quot;.
  
We left aside two things:
  
How can we store a link in the org syntax to the specific &quot;place&quot; (in Emacs) I am visiting?
 When we&#x27;ve stored an org mode link with the command provided by org-mode, how can …</span>

                              <span>In the official docs on keybinding conventions, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html it says &quot;Don’t define C-c letter as a key in Lisp programs&quot;, and while &quot;C-x&quot; isn&#x27;t mentioned, my understanding is that anything beginning with &quot;C-x&quot; is reserved for Emacs itself. It also states &quot;Sequences consisting of C-c followed by any other ASCII punctuation or symbol character are allocated for minor modes&quot;.
 However, many downloadable packages provide functions that are intended to be globally accessible, independently of major of minor modes. Many packages that I use, such as Magit, rg, projectile, suggest global keybindings to access their functionality (or even provide functions that will set &quot;default&quot; keybindings in the sacred &quot;C-c letter&quot; space!)
 These are all over the place - Magit uses &quot;C-x&quot;, Tide uses &quot;M-,&quot; and &quot;M-.&quot;, and so on. The most common case seems to be, the package recommends binding some functions to key combinations in the &quot;C-c letter&quot; space, but doesn&#x27;t actually perform the binding itself.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there have been any discussions of this topic in the emacs community, and if there is any consensus or tentative directions proposed.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there.
 I have recently re-installed emacs to use org-mode again, and I am trying to get nice previews or latex equations and fragments in org-mode (on macOS using emacs-mac). The default dvisvgm works nicely, however it seems lualatex cannot easily be used to create dvi images, as such I have to try something else. I wish to use lualatex for nice fonts and for drawing diagrams (some of the packages I wish to sue require the use of lualatex to compile).
 My current process is to compile to pdf using the following preamble
 latex \documentclass[preview, border&#x3D;1pt]{standalone} \usepackage{usenames}[color] [PACKAGES] [DEFAULT-PACKAGES] \pagestyle{empty} 
 In above, [DEFAULT-PACKAGES] is defined based on org-latex-default-packages-alist and [PACKAGES] is defined based on org-latex-packages…</span>

                              <span>I am used to switch buffers with ctrl-mouse-1 yet lsp-mode installs a binding for textDocument/definition. I do not want that binding or want it rather replaced with another binding.
 The documentation lists default key bindings but not the mouse bindings. As I am relatively new to Emacs,
  
How can I display all bindings lsp-mode binds (mouse+keyboard)
 How can I specifically rebind the existing ctrl-mouse-1 to another combination?

 But can&#x27;t we just write new functions in elisp which make it possible to have functions which only do the movements or operators and then combine them as in vim completely ignoring the emacs editing commands like &quot;kill-region&quot; etc? 
 I guess evil already does this. But since this kind of &quot;feature&quot; is not built into emacs as such, does this cause an inherent limitation or difficulty?

 tl;dr
  
simplified subsumption seems to make common code I write in industry clunky for no good reason in lots of places
 
Are others concerned with motivating what seem like &quot;pointless lambdas&quot; to new hires or students for simple tasks?
 
Are there more real world advantages that make these frequent annoyances worth it?
 
How is quicklook impredicativity useful in industry?
 
 The biggest advantage seems to be that laziness is more predictable.
 However looking at commits fixing simplified subsumption errors on github I see very common patterns in industry Haskell now need an explicit lambda for &quot;reasons&quot; such as:
  readFreqSumFile :: (MonadSafe m) &#x3D;&gt; FilePath -&gt; m (FreqSumHeader, Producer FreqSumEntry m ()) - readFreqSumFile file &#x3D; readFreqSumProd $ withFile file Rea…</span>

                              <span>I try to config Akka Cluster for my Play Framework (version 2.8). I assume that I cannot use default akka system of Play, because the only thing I can custom is changing the actorSystem name. Therefore I cannot change the &#x60; actor.provider to &quot;cluster&quot;, Play ignores my cluster config and keep the system remain &quot;local&quot;. Following the document, which describe how to use my own system, I have several things to do. Can someone explain why &quot;Pass in the correct classloader from the Play Environment otherwise Akka won’t be able to find your applications classes&quot; ? And give me the detail example of this. I decided to post here because there&#x27;s no one online in r/akka Thank you !

 I know there&#x27;s C-x &lt; to scroll right, but it doesn&#x27;t let me go back one character and be on the last column of the previous screen.
 Thanks!

 Essentially Tabbar and Project.el integration.
 How do we automatically create a new tabbar with entering a new project? Also switch tabs in tabbar when switching projects?
 Please share your config. Thank you.

 vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(&#x27;v&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &quot;:&#x27;copy&#x27;gv&quot;, {noremap &#x3D; true, silent &#x3D; true}) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(&#x27;v&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &quot;:&#x27;copy&#x27;&gt;gv&quot;, {noremap &#x3D; true, silent &#x3D; true}) 
 using following mapping in doom emacs fails (syntax error), but I&#x27;m not sure why:
 (define-key evil-visual-state-map &quot;\S-\M-j&quot; &quot;:&#x27;copy&#x27;copy&#x27;&gt;&quot;) 
 Executing &quot;:&#x27;copy&#x27;&lt;-1&quot; on cmdline on selection seems to work ok (selected lines are duplicated).
 ​
 Here is similar working mapping that duplicates current line and it works ok (in normal mode):
 (define-key evil-normal-state-map &quot;\S-\M-j&quot; &quot;:.copy.&quot;) (define-key evil-normal-state-map &quot;\S-\M-k&quot; &quot;:.copy.-1&quot;)

You can type the form in the scratch buffer, and then type LFD (or C-j) after it. The result of evaluating the form will be inserted in the buffer.
  
But I just get the new line instead of form value being inserted in the buffer.
 I thought it could be due to my evil mode or evil escape mode but disabling them also didn&#x27;t work. 
 Typing C-h k C-j revealed that C-j is bound to electric new line function but even disabling electric mode didn&#x27;t work. What&#x27;s wrong?

                              <span>I use org-mode to write novels and short stories, but I have a problem with exporting.
 When I use the emphasis near a guillemets, such as

 In this case, the begin of the emphasis is after the word “that”, not at its begin.
 I remember I was able to fix it a while ago adding guillemets on a configuration string, but I forgot its name and location.

                              <span>Hi, I would like to disable electric-indent-mode for only one file named phrases.tex. Is there a file that I can place in the folder and tells emacs to disable to it for that file?
 Also, is it possible to enable a custom input method, instead of enabling it manually every time I open the phrases.tex file with C-u \ The name of the input method I need enabled is custom-input-method. The default input method is rfc1345. Is there a way to do that using that one single file as well?
 UPDATE: I tried adding this to the file with the LaTeX &quot;percent sign comment&quot; first so LaTeX doesn&#x27;t fail when processing the file to produce a PDF:
 % -*- electric-indent-mode: nil; current-input-method: &quot;custom-input-method&quot; -*-
 The electric-indent-mode is applied, but the current-input-method doesn&#x27;t seem to be applied. I tried settings both variables current-input-method and default-input-method but nothing.

                              <span>I have a couple of functions to enlarge and shrink the current window when there are two windows left | right of each other.
 (defun b/enlarge-window-horizontally (times) &quot;Enlarge window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (enlarge-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10))) (defun b/shrink-window-horizontally (times) &quot;Shrink window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (shrink-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10))) 
 For argument let&#x27;s say the point is at the end of the line.
 If I shrink too much, the point remains visible (which I like) and I get little arrows in the gutter indicating the text is truncated &quot;off screen&quot; to the left. That&#x27;s good. 
 If I enlarge the window again though, the point remains fixed, those arrows remain and the text is still &quot;off screen&quot;. 
 Now If move to the beginning of the line, then back to the end of the line, the full text is visible once again and the arrows are gone.
 I&#x27;ve tried getting my functions to do that last part for me but it&#x27;s failing: 
 (defun b/enlarge-window-horizontally (times) &quot;Enlarge window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (enlarge-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10)) (let ((saved (point))) (beginning-of-line) (goto-char saved))) (defun b/shrink-window-horizontally (times) &quot;Shrink window horizontally by 10 columns instead of 1. Using prefix argument to multiply the effect.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (shrink-window-horizontally (* (or times 1) 10)) (let ((saved (point))) (beginning-of-line) (goto-char saved))) 
 Those additions have no effect on the arrows or the text truncated off-screen.
 Why don&#x27;t those additions to my functions force the off-screen text to come back into view again - like when I do that manually?
 More importantly how can I get them to do that for me?

 elisp (switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect org-journal-file)) 
 This line does not reliably open the existing buffer (visiting a certain file), but creates new window (+ buffer).
 Is there another way to switch to a buffer (if it exists), and create a new one otherwise?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 Trying to edit a ruby file, an error occurred and i do not know how deal with it.
 I am using Doom Emacs and got the following output when opening any ruby files.
 Error (ruby-mode-hook): Error running hook &quot;inf-ruby-keys&quot; because: (error Autoloading file /home/shiru/.emacs.d/.local/straight/build-27.2/inf-ruby/inf-ruby.elc failed to define function inf-ruby-keys) 
 Any advice?

                              <span>I am using vertico for minibuffer autocompletion. After i got a list of results in minibuffer,
 i invoke embark and get the embark-live buffer, but the minibuffer still keeps open, if I press ctrl-g to exit minibuffer, then the embark-live buffer also got hidden...
 For other things like embark-collection or embark-export, when invoked, what happened is the minibuffer will close and i have the exported buffer ready for me to explore. did i miss anything? 
 Did some research on google but no luck to find an answer...
 already filed an issue at https://github.com/oantolin/embark/issues/503, but just want to check here to see if that is rather my configuration issue.

                              <span>As an academic I have been interested in learning orgmode and using it in my work flow.
 So it goes like this:
 1- Lot of reading and tutorials
 2- It seems I have to learn EMACS first, and to be comfortable with it I must develop enough muscle memory and remember the keystrokes
 3- This is too slow, I am still not as effective with it as mere notepad++
 4- This is taking too much time, ok now I am losing interest..
 5- Ok, I am too busy and need to get shit done, let me table this for a while
 6- Rinse and repeat steps 1-5
 ​
 ? I guess I will take another stab at it and perhaps reach enlightenment this time around. EMACS and it keystrokes are my bottleneck I think, I was never very good with memorizing.

                              <span>Dear All,
 I am continuing my experiment with Org mode meetups and online debugging.
 Anyone who wants to discuss and/or debug Org-related issues is welcome.
 If you want to provide improvements to Org, but feel overwhelmed about the contribution process or the vast Org codebase, we can touch on that as well.
 This time, I plan to talk about some Org mode internals. Specifically, the newly added folding engine org-fold.el
 Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.
 The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Kyiv; 2pm London; 9am New York). Sat, May 7
 I will post the link to the meeting one hour before the meeting start.

                              <span>Hey there! After 7 years exclusively with Scala backend I&#x27;m about to start a new project that needs to have a proper frontend. I&#x27;m a bit FP maniac and cannot imagine myself getting back to JavaScript or TypeScript. I&#x27;m super rusty with everything frontend-related, but was considering three options:
  
Elm - I like the simplicity a lot; have some concerns about its future
 ReScript - kind of Scala&#x27;s uncanny valley: on one hand semantics are very close, on the other it&#x27;s just not it, having hard times to get used to syntax; among all options seems to be the most future-proof
 Scala.js - obviously the comfort zone, but no idea if it&#x27;s a viable option for the frontend
  
My requirements are:
  
I have very limited resources - so don&#x27;t have time to write own libs (perhaps just bindings), which means I really want to use all JS libs possible (React, sliders, widgets etc). This is where I have the most concerns about Scala.js (scalajs-react looks great, but seems to be the only big thing ported properly) and most sympathy for ReScript
 It has to be an Electron app. Seems to be possible with all options, but wanted to raise since it means the bundle-size doesn&#x27;t matter (although performance does!)
  
So, my question - is it worth to try out Scala.js (with scalajs-react, I think) or go with more conventional options? With scalajs-react is it possible to integrate existing React UI components?

Thanks to that, they catch lots of attention from the functional programming community.
Still, you can have a hard time understanding how they work just by looking at data declarations and type definitions.
In this post, I present a way of encoding optics that is different from usual.
This encoding, called existential optics, is easier to understand than the other encodings, since it makes more explicit the structure of each optic.
This is not new and is well known in the category theory academic circles.
Still, these ideas do not seem to appear in libraries for languages like Haskell, Purescript, or Scala.
The most well-known type of optics are lenses, which were also the first to be…</span>

                              <span>So I have been using a system I built in notion for some time now ( built on the PPV - pillars, pipelines, vaults system by august bradley). I&#x27;m a big fan of the design of this system and I&#x27;m interested in utilizing the system in org-mode.
 However I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around how to do it. I figured if I lay out the rough sketches perhaps the experienced users here can point me in the directions of package add-ons, settings and features that can help make this move. 
 I&#x27;m interested in general in &quot;owning&quot; my data. I don&#x27;t expect anyone to fully grok my system off a quick reddit post so I&#x27;ll try to highlight the important elements and ofc feel free to ask questions.
 In case it is helpful below is a flow chart of the system

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 I apologize if this has been dealt with before, but I wasn&#x27;t able to find an answer to my question.
 I have the following lines in my config file:
 (use-package org :config (setq visual-line-mode t) (setq org-support-shift-select &#x27;always)) 
 Yet, when I open an org mode file, neither visual-line-mode nor org-support-shift-select are active. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something simple, but I can&#x27;t get either of those to work when org mode loads.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I want to write a README.org for a gitlab repository. Most of it &#x27;just works&#x27; &lt;3 However, there are some things I am not able to figure out and I was wondering if the more experienced folk here might have a tip or two. Some issues I am facing:
  
The headings do not get anchor links. The README is quite long, and I would really like to have anchor links and perhaps even some sort of a TOC.
 
I cannot figure out how to create internal links. For instance, [[*heading 1][heading link]] does not work.
 
More an annoyance than a limitation: I am using inline-code markup for commands like mv ~/xyz ~/abc. The markup for this would be ~mv ~~/xyz ~~/abc~. This is not rendered correctly by gitlab. 
 
 I would be very grateful for helpful links, tips, and suggestions. 
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hello guys ✌🏻 My question is for those who has ever used binance api. Im relatively new in Haskell. I started my project, and Im trying to call binance api doing simple GET request, using http-conduit library. It always responses with error 400 Bad Request, without detailed message, for each endpoint Im trying to call. I did the same via nodejs using axios, and it worked well. but my goal is to use haskell. 
 Has anybody had the same ? is http-conduit a good approach for http requests ?
 I’ll appreciate any advice thanks !

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Haskell to split up a csv to divvy up some data before processing. I&#x27;m still new to Haskell and have just recently started learning cabal. On my system, Cabal is acting up, leaving me unable to install split onto my system. I decided to just try to build a simple split function rather than go through what I would need to do to fix cabal for the moment, but I&#x27;m not really sure how that&#x27;s supposed to work. I wanted to try to treat the IO String coming from the file as just a list of characters, but even that is beyond me, apparently. 
 ​
 What would the proper way of splitting an IO String on a delimiter (specifically &#x27;,&#x27;) be?

                              <span>I&#x27;m just getting started using org roam extensively for all my notes. One particular issue I have experienced is how to search my dailies notes and sort then from newest to oldest? I for example tag my meeting notes with project name / number. Often I want to list all project notes and sort then at the same time, so I easily can look through them. Have tried with ripgrep / deadgrep, but as theese tools run in parallel it won&#x27;t sort mye notes. 
 Any good solutions to this problem?

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 I have been trying to get Sql Server working with lsp-mode for a while and im quite stumped. I&#x27;ve got Lsp-mode installed and lsp-mssql, i put in the connection details but when i open a sql file, lsp mode is activated however it does not seem to connect to server. I have a hunch it has to do with me leaving the username and password fields blank due to single sign on here at work but im not sure how to change it to single-sign-on/integrated. Does anyone have any suggestions? I have linked the mssql.log as well as the lsp-mode status showing sql server disconnected.

                              <span>I really enjoy Doom themes. In particular I like doom-vibrant. The problem is that there are a bunch of faces where the color of the text doesn&#x27;t show up against the background. One of them is variable-pitch. I assume that variable-pitch face is pretty ubiquitous so I am surprised I am having this problem and that I can&#x27;t find others mentioning this. Has anyone else had this issue?
 A small screenshot of the text displayed with variable-pitch font under doom-vibrant theme. 
 A screenshot of my local configuration for the variable-pitch face in case someone notices anything I am missing. 
 ​
 EDIT: Actually the issue seems to be not with doom-themes at all but with the variable-pitch face (see screenshot under default theme)
 ​
 Text with variable-pitch theme under default theme. 
 ​
 Could this be due to my font choice?
 Font section of my config. 
 ​
 EDIT2: Seems it was due to the use of the Cantarell font for variable-pitch... Removed, seems to be better. I don&#x27;t understand fonts at all...

 Hey Emacsers,
 What a great day to talk about EMACS :)
 Let&#x27;s set the scene!
 We&#x27;ve just written a new command named my-new-command that we&#x27;ve added to our init file ~/.emacs.d/init.el (or whatever init file your are using except org-mode file).
 To write our new command we had to look at the help of the macro pcase and the elisp info node &quot;Current Buffer&quot;.
 Now let&#x27;s say we want to keep the links to these help and info buffers in comments near to the definition of our new command.
 Is is possible? How do we do that?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am posting this here to start planning for solutions once the YAML front-matter option is removed.
 Why remove YAML?
 I had a lot of loose code to support both TOML and YAML exports and it worked OK so far. But that implementation wasn&#x27;t generic enough to support more planned features in ox-hugo.
 I prefer TOML over YAML (but that&#x27;s a discussion for another day) and so I decided to pick just that and develop a generic library that would convert Lisp data to TOML. That was roughly a week back when I wrote this post: https://scripter.co/defining-tomelr/.
 Fast forward to today; I ended up creating tomelr.el and I wrote about it in https://scripter.co/presenting-tomelr/.
 The end-user wouldn&#x27;t typically care if the front-matter was in TOML or YAML because that front-matter is mainly for Hugo&#x27;s consumption. But it would be more of a ox-hugo maintenance headache if I were to keep supporting both.
 And so YAML support will be going away ..
 ox-hugo v0.11.0 Release
 https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/releases/tag/v0.11.0
 Why am I posting this here?
 If you are an ox-hugo user and set org-hugo-front-matter-format to &quot;yaml&quot;, try removing that customization (or set it to &quot;toml&quot;) and see if the latest version of ox-hugo causes any problem for you.
 Theoretically, it should make no difference in the final website created by Hugo. But if you do see any issue, please report it on https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues.

 I also see json-navigator on melpa, but that doesn&#x27;t have filtering afaict.

                              <span>Hi there, I was wondering how would you model this Scala ADT in Java:
 sealed trait Order { def id: String def action: Unit &#x3D; this match { case Order.Paid(_, _) &#x3D;&gt; // do A case Order.Packed(_, _) &#x3D;&gt; // do B case Order.Shipped(_, _) &#x3D;&gt; // do C } } object Order { case class Paid(id: String, paymentId: String) extends Order { def pack(boxType: String): Packed &#x3D; Packed(id, boxType) } case class Packed(id: String, boxType: String) extends Order { def ship(trackingNumber: String): Shipped &#x3D; Shipped(id, trackingNumber) } case class Shipped(id: String, trackingNumber: String) extends Order } 
 I considered a couple of options, but couldn&#x27;t find the best one.

                              <span>We are a team of skilled Scala developers who like to write pure functional and clean Scala code. We are working mostly full-stack with little frontend but quite a bit of DevOps. Our stack includes a lot of OSS, like Jenkins, Spark, git, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and libraries including zio, cats, circe, monix, fs2, akka streams, http4s, and shapeless. In addition, we heavily make use of AWS and cloud computing.
 We strive to empower women in the tech business and strive for more diversity and thus especially welcome non-male applications. Equal pay is the norm for us and we work with an open salary policy. Everyone gets the same in the same bracket. No individual negotiations.

                              <span>I built a jar file by sbt-assembly (sbt publishLocal) but the lib doesn&#x27;t work as expected. The case class in the lib cannot be used normally. The IDE showed its definition (see my ugly screenshot in comment ) as java code. The subproject at the same place with the lib can be used all class normally. How can I build a &quot;real&quot; scala lib that can be used normally in other scala project?Thank you for reading !

                              <span>Friends, I&#x27;m learning Haskell with the goal of programming in Plutus / Cardano. I&#x27;m currently trying to install a Cardano node following this: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/blob/56898031b9f55608521ccb6d7f616579856d52b7/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node.md#macos
 ​
 I have a M1 Monterrey with arm. 
 Initially I had troubles in the libsodium&#x60; step &quot;./configure&quot;, where I had this error:
 checking for gcc... clang checking whether the C compiler works... no
 ​
 After searching in internet, I found that uninstalling brew llvm, and installing Xcode made this step works. But then at this step:
 cabal build all
 I get this error from the terminal: 
 Make sure you have installed LLVM between [9 and 13)
 ​
 Anyone has this error, or was able to run the Cardano node in a M1? This is my which clang:
 /usr/bin/clang
 ​
 Thank you!

 e.g take 10 [1,2,3,4,5] will yield [1,2,3,4,5]
 How does it not generate an error ?

But every time I put the long command in PowerShell it just closes without doing anything. Online I just found people that got error messages, but none with the exact same problem. I&#x27;ve tried running PowerShell as an admin and then the installation would start, though I didn&#x27;t go through with it as it specifically states not to install it as admin. What can I do?

                              <span>Just thought I&#x27;d drop in to plug the newest version of my JSON mangling library, aeson-quick.
 I made it yonks ago so that I could do extract data from an Aeson Value using a simple query syntax like so:
 value .! &quot;[{key1,key2}]&quot; :: [(a, b)] 
 More documentation on Github.
 Also included in this release: 
  
QuasiQuoters for compile time checking of queries, so you can write [quick|[{key1,key2}]|] for more safety
 Better definition of how it is supposed to work, and better tests
 Same great performance (somehow faster than using Aeson directly in included benchmarks, not sure how that works tbh)
 Array indexing, ie you can write: &quot;[[.]3]&quot; to get the third element of each sub-array. You can also get a range with &quot;[[.]3-6]&quot;.
  
Enjoy!

                              <span>I usually import Data.Semigroup because it re-exports Data.Monoid and also has a few types which aren&#x27;t Monoids, Min Max and Arg. 
 Today I struggled with a confusing type error for a couple minutes before I realized that this is incorrect! Data.Semigroup defines First and Last differently:
 ghci&gt; import qualified Data.Semigroup as S ghci&gt; :t S.First S.First :: a -&gt; S.First a ghci&gt; import qualified Data.Monoid as M ghci&gt; :t M.First M.First :: Maybe a -&gt; First a 
 Maybe (S.First a) has the same behaviour of M.First a, because Maybe&#x27;s Semigroup uses the underlying type and the semigroup for S.First is \a b -&gt; a.
 Re-exporting almost everything and then adding two incompatible definitions still seems a bit unfortunate, though.
 I couldn&#x27;t find any mention of this name clash online, maybe reading about this saves someone else five minutes.

 example of what this does: f 2 [1,2,3] &#x3D; [1,1,2,2,3,3]
 the problem is I have no idea how this does that and I&#x27;m extremely confused on everything. so if somebody could pls eli5 that&#x27;d be nice. ty!

                              <span>I suspect that the right answer from the point of view of productivity is &quot;don&#x27;t integrate Twitter and Emacs&quot;, but if you&#x27;ll humor me I&#x27;d like to try. A bunch of packages I&#x27;ve found have all been abandoned or haven&#x27;t been updated in a while, with the implied cause being changes to the authentication method.
 Here are a few methods I&#x27;ve seen:
  
Twittering mode: Sounds like this was the best way to use Twitter a few years ago, but looks unmaintained. Does anyone still use it?
 
nntwitter: Uses gnus, with every user you follow becoming an individual feed. I&#x27;ve tried it, and while it kind of works, I follow ~200 people, so it takes 30 minutes or so to refresh. Plus I want to create a single time-ordered feed to read, and haven&#x27;t worked out how to create a virtual group to do this yet.
 
gnus-twit: From larsmagne, which also uses gnus. Has anyone else tried it? Is it secure now that it uses Nitter?
 
 I found this post from yesterday when I did a search of the subreddit, haven&#x27;t gone through it yet.

                              <span>I am using emojis in my org-files a lot (folder icon, task icon etc) in Emacs 28.1 (see below)
 Now obviously the length of one emoji is not calculated correctly, that&#x27;s why org-columns creates a table with misaligned column lines. See attached screenshot.

 Apparently this has been addressed here as well:

 But I don&#x27;t see how to mitigate this?

                              <span>For example, org mode defines org-mouse-map. As far as I understand, this map is used context-sensitively, it is only active on links. So I could use, for example:
 (define-key org-mouse-map (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) &#x27;org-open-at-point) 
 This means that I can use C-l to open a link. But if the point is not on a link, C-l will does its original function. This works as intended.
 However, it doesn&#x27;t work if I try to use an evil keybinding which is only active in normal mode:
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal org-mouse-map (kbd &quot;RET&quot;) &#x27;org-open-at-point) 
 If it worked, I could use RET to open a link when I&#x27;m in normal mode.
 Some additional info: if the point is on a link, and I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps), then RET starts to work, but it will try to open links everywhere, not just on links. If I execute (evil-normalize-keymaps) when the point is not on a link, then RET doesn&#x27;t work afterwards. So it seems that (evil-normalize-keymaps) is affected by where the point is.
 Is this a not-implemented feature of evil?

I feel there&#x27;re so many things going on with emacs that you absolutely have no idea where to start. I have tried to read some blog posts on how to get started, but these have been too simplistic to help me in any way. I also tried some tutorial videos and found a series by system crafters. While the content is very good, because they are recorded from a livestream, it means I have to go through hours upon hours of videos just to extract useful information. When I started learning vim, I found a 2h video that basically explained the most relevant things and left me in a p…</span>

                              <span>Here is a new package providing improved continuous scrolling in pdf-tools and doc-view (please read instructions first). This is the successor of the pdf-continuous-scroll package. Making it a new package (instead of an update), was necessarry because this package provides a general &#x27;display engine&#x27; which can be used also by other packages, like doc-view.
 Besides having extracted the &#x27;display functionality&#x27; into a separate package, the code and functionality of the engine has been simplified, so that it is (even) easier to understand and maintain, and also it should increase compatibility with complementary packages (like pdf-tools and doc-view).
 The engine works very fine, although I would be very happy if anybody has an idea for a solution of the remaining (minor) issue described in the README. It seems to be working quite well also with most/all pdf-tools-modes, although it is not straightforward to make everything work flawlessly. Despite, the minor issues, I guess it works quite fine already for most people. Happy scrolling!

                              <span>I used to use an external editor extension for thunderbird to compose my email in emacs. However, with a thunderbird update several years ago, that extension has been deprecated.
 I like the idea of having a central local repository on my computer for mail (and calendar) - just different ways to interface it (either emacs or thunderbird). My understanding is that offlineimap and notmuch replicate your email archive separately from what exists say in thunderbird, and nowadays it&#x27;s necessary to compose HTML emails for which I would use the thunderbird editor.
 Anyone have any suggestions (cross-platform, or just Windows at the moment) to integrate the two? &quot;Emacs everywhere&quot; seems to be a Linux solution.

 i.e: use pythonenv in nixshell.

                              <span>When working in different projects with files with similar names and structure, it&#x27;s hard to know from which project each file is when switching buffer (using ivy-switch-buffer).
 For example, I have the following files/buffers open:
 /project1/Delivery/Package.ext /project2/Deliveries/Package.ext 
 I tried to use the Uniquify package to remedy this, I set it to show 1 parent directory like this:
 Delivery/Package.ext Deliveries/Package.ext 
 But since the projects share similar file names and locations, I don&#x27;t always remember if the file is from a project or another, and showing more parent directories would take the whole mode-line.
 What would be your suggestion to solve this issue?
 I thought about placing the project name (from projectile-project-name) before all buffers&#x27; names, but I&#x27;m not sure how to do that.
 I also tried ivy-rich but I thought it is a bit slow and cluttered. There&#x27;s also the bufler package that I want to try, but it&#x27;s not installing properly from MELPA, so I&#x27;m still looking for a good solution.
 My current workaround is to work in different frames, and use projectile-switch-to-buffer, but sometimes it would be good to quickly switch in one frame.
 Appreciate any help and suggestions. Thanks!

                              <span>I just post here some information I would have like to have a couple of weeks ago. I bought a boox note air 2 eink tablet and I hoped to be able to have the same workflow for emacs as with some laptops of mine.
 For those that also want this I can post - I installed nix-on-droid https://github.com/t184256/nix-on-droid - I could manage to install the emacs overlay https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay - intsall xserver with xsdl https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;x.org.server&amp;gl&#x3D;US - latex preview and everything works with tectonic (so that you don&#x27;t have to download gb and gb of data for latex distribution)
 and it freaking works!! and it works well, the emacs version I tested is
 GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (build 1. aarch64-unkown-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.30, cairo version 1.16.0)
 If many people are insterested I can write a blog post about it too. It would ahve greatly helped me as I have not seen it anywhere.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve followed this guide on how to setup lsp-mode with javascript and eslint.(I know its for react but same principles can be applied).
 This issue I&#x27;m facing it that lsp eslint ignores my /.eslintrc settings
 ​
 You can see semi colon error is off but emacs lsp suggest otherwise
 ​
 Upon adding semi colon errors go away.
 My setup
 (use-package flycheck :hook (prog-mode . flycheck-mode) :preface (defun my/typescript-mode-setup () &quot;Custom setup for Typescript mode&quot; (setq flycheck-checker #&#x27;javascript-eslint)) :config (add-hook &#x27;typescript-mode-hook #&#x27;my/typescript-mode-setup) (general-define-key :states &#x27;normal :keymaps &#x27;flycheck-mode-map &quot;] g&quot; &#x27;(flycheck-next-error :which-key &quot;Next error&quot;) &quot;[ g&quot; &#x27;(flycheck-previous-error :which-key &quot;Prev error&quot;))) (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :hook (prog-mode . lsp-mode) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-l&quot; lsp-completion-provider :none) :custom (lsp-disabled-clients &#x27;((python-mode . pyls))) (lsp-eslint-run &quot;onSave&quot;) (lsp-eslint-auto-fix-on-save t) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) 
 I&#x27;ve installed eslint using npm i -g eslint as well as lsp-install-server. 
 The flycheck-checker is set &#x27;lsp.

 (org-element-property :raw-link (org-element-context)) 
 But I did not find an obvious way to get the description. What&#x27;s the easiest way to do that?

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Control.Foldl provides
 either :: Fold a1 b1 -&gt; Fold a2 b2 -&gt; Fold (Either a1 a2) (b1, b2) 
 It only works for one Either, but we can generalize it to an arbitrary number of Eithers like this:
 infixl 4  class Profunctor p &#x3D;&gt; Shawarma p where wrap :: b -&gt; p Void b () :: p a (c -&gt; d) -&gt; p b c -&gt; p (Either a b) d data Pair a b &#x3D; Pair !a !b instance Shawarma Fold where wrap x &#x3D; Fold const x id Fold step1 begin1 final1  Fold step2 begin2 final2 &#x3D; Fold step begin final where step (Pair acc1 acc2) xOrY &#x3D; case xOrY of Left x -&gt; Pair (step1 acc1 x) acc2 Right y -&gt; Pair acc1 (step2 acc2 y) begin &#x3D; Pair begin1 begin2 final (Pair acc1 acc2) &#x3D; final1 acc1 (final2 acc2) 
 A test:
 test1 :: Fold a d -&gt; Fold b e -&gt; Fold c f -&gt; Fold (Either (Either a b) c) (d, e, f) test1 fold1 fold2 fold3 &#x3D; (,,)  fold1  fold2  fold3 
 And we can have more instances, e.g.:
 instance Shawarma Tagged where wrap &#x3D; Tagged Tagged f  Tagged x &#x3D; Tagged $ f x instance Shawarma (Forget r) where wrap _ &#x3D; Forget absurd Forget f  Forget g &#x3D; Forget $ Either.either f g instance Applicative g &#x3D;&gt; Shawarma (Joker g) where wrap &#x3D; Joker . pure Joker f  Joker a &#x3D; Joker $ f  a instance Decidable f &#x3D;&gt; Shawarma (Clown f) where wrap _ &#x3D; Clown lost Clown f  Clown a &#x3D; Clown $ chosen f a 
 If we replace Either with (,) we&#x27;ll get
 () :: p a (c -&gt; d) -&gt; p b c -&gt; p (a, b) d 
 which can be used like that:
 test2 :: Fold a d -&gt; Fold b e -&gt; Fold c f -&gt; Fold ((a, b), c) (d, e, f) test2 fold1 fold2 fold3 &#x3D; (,,)  fold1  fold2  fold3 
 but that&#x27;s just
 () :: Biapplicative p &#x3D;&gt; p a (c -&gt; d) -&gt; p b c -&gt; p (a, b) d p  q &#x3D; bipure (,) id &gt; p &gt; q 
 So given that Shawarma is kinda Decidable in its first argument and Applicative in its second one, does it also have some non-tasty-sounding category-theory-inspired name?

                              <span>I’m responsible for making a performance test framework for our enterprises data layer. 
 My requirements are:
  
There will eventually be several “scenarios” we are interested in the performance of our application under, but starting with just one
 The scenario should be repeatable and consistently arrange the “state of the world” prior to each test to isolate performance issues to code as opposed to changes in underlying data
 Each scenario starts, should run a set of “actions” that create side effects the application should respond to. Some actions run in parallel, some serially.
 Measure certain things
  
I have a decent mental map of how to do everything but #3. Previously (in c#.Net) I achieved this by modeling the problem (different applications) as a graph — for example:
 Run Action A Then Run Action B, C, D When B is done kick off E When C is done kick off F When D is done kick off G
 While it seemed like the right way to go about this, it always felt unnecessarily complicated and harder for others to follow for what should of been such a simple thing. 
 Other considerations: The main “performance” concerns of my application is how it responds to CRUD events in the database. I had looked at Gatling, but it seems much more focused on web-app requests and I’m not sure how it would help me to mitigate my particular performance concern 
 Any advice on the SIMPLEST way to achieve such a goal?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am settling with obsidian because I can add mathematical equations to my zettels. I work with R and do statistics, so it is a requirement for me.
Anyway, I am familiar with the zettelkasten method and have read the &quot;Getting Started&quot; section. However, how do you implement it in obsidian? Can anyone share a blog post or something? I also use the system for academic and research purposes.
Thanks.</span>

Wanted to share that article with you in case you tweak fonts a lot. It&#x27;s from a UX study firm.
TL;DR:  reading on the web is fastest with Garamond (serif font) on average. It&#x27;s not the fastest per se.
Personal highlight 

  
Second, and worse, users don’t know what’s best for them, so they can’t choose the best font, even if they were given the option to customize their fonts. In this study, participants read 14% faster in their fastest font (314 WPM, on average) compared to their most preferred font (275 WPM, on average).</span>

 Hey folks, I&#x27;ve been working on org-hyperscheduler for the last couple of months. It&#x27;s used to time-block your day from emacs (via org-agenda) or from a browser interface. I find the visual aspect much more conducive to accurate planning.
 This is my very first module, so let me know what you think and what can be improved!

                              <span>I use folders to organize my notes. It seems like beorg does not download subfolders and hence only the notes in the linked folders can be recognized. Is there a workaround? Keeping all my notes in one folder may make the organization cluttered for me.

 I mean, what I&#x27;m looking for is something like this but while I am editing an *.tex file. I have tried the texfrag package, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work or I&#x27;m too stupid to set it up. Can someone explain to me how can this be achieved?
 I&#x27;m currently using Doom, pretty much vanilla, so I don&#x27;t have much experience customizing Emacs.

 GNU Hyperbole 8.0.0, the Epiphany release, is now available on GNU ELPA. Hyperbole is a unique hypertextual information management Emacs package that works across all Emacs modes, letting the computer do the hard work while you benefit from its sophisticated context-sensitive linking and navigation capabilities. Hyperbole has always been one of the best documented Emacs packages. With Version 8 comes excellent test coverage: over 200 automated tests to ensure quality. We hope you&#x27;ll give it a try.
 What&#x27;s new in this release is described here:
 www.gnu.org/s/hyperbole/HY-NEWS.html
 Everything back until release 7.1.3 is new since the last major release announcement (over a year ago), so updates are extensive.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I use the simple but very convenient code-cells package to run python cells. E.g. with the Spyder IDE, the cell where the cursor is currently in has a different background color, and I&#x27;d love to have that in emacs. Would you have any idea on how to do that? 
 I guess one idea is to find the closest &quot;# %%&quot; pattern up and down from cursor and change background color in that region, but I have no idea how to implement this, also for it to change back to the normal background when the cursor is not in the cell anymore...
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

These default coding systems were tried to encode text 
 in the buffer ‘*markdown-output*’: 
 (iso-latin-1-dos (1241 . 8216) (1244 . 8217) (1250 . 8216) (1253 
 . 8217) (1259 . 8216) (1262 . 8217)) 
 However, each of them encountered characters it couldn’t encode: 
 iso-latin-1-dos cannot encode these: ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’
  
Original:
 Counter({&#x27;AA&#x27;: 2, &#x27;AB&#x27;: 1, &#x27;AC&#x27;: 1}) 
 Output:

                              <span>I have found one major limitation in Emacs that I cannot circumvent. Its ability to expand text is limited. abbrev-mode can expand words into other words or phrases. For example, I can ask Emacs to expand &quot;edv&quot; into &quot;Emacs Developmental Version.&quot; However, it can only expand single words, not phrases. For example, it does not appear to be able to expand &quot;Emacs Developmental Version&quot; into &quot;edv&quot;. (Or change a phrase like &quot;a lot of&quot; into &quot;many&quot;. However, in Sublime Text, one can expand phrases into words and other phrases, using the snippet feature. One can also expand whole sentences. The popular plugin yasnippet does not overcome this limitation.

                              <span>Consider this.
 The difficulty with vim is not memorisation. Vim commands are all very mnemonic and follow a consistent pattern of naming, with a verb object syntax. The difficulty here is to the grok the language concept of vim and thus requires some cognitive effort and intelligence.
 The difficulty with emacs is that you have to memorise hundreds of unrelated shortcuts which do not follow any conistent pattern of naming let alone &quot;the language model of vim. &quot; So it is easier for those who mindlessly memorise stuff but find it difficult to understand deep concepts.

 I have defined some custom minor modes without proper docstrings in my config, recently those definition failed:
  Wrong type argument: char-or-string-p, nil 
 until I changed &quot;&quot; to &quot; &quot; (a single space).
 Edit: I found that commit ec464789dfc5179c72e6929ea99a72f508c562b6 has changed easy-mmode--mode-docstring&#x27;s behavior on its DOC argument.

I checked that its because the color definition has been changed from something like &quot;color-38&quot; to a named color such as &quot;mistyrose&quot; etc. And the color choices also increase. Yet as I checked in emacs release page, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be new features related to color settings.

 The problem is that ̚ is a special character that I use for phonetic transcriptions, it&#x27;s the &quot;unreleased stop consonant&quot; and it has the hex code U+031A.
 I can insert it by using M-X insert-char then typing #x031A but is there something that I can use to replace t| with t̚ across all the document?

                              <span>The deeper I delve into Emacs, the more I come to appreciate its vanilla keybindings over vim&#x27;s and the reasoning behind them. The problem is, even after relatively short sessions(lasting around thirty minutes or so) of editing, I always find my pinky aching(and kinda tired as well) and setting caps lock as an alternative control key hasn&#x27;t helped much, the ache&#x27;s still there.
 So I&#x27;ve come here asking you, O followers of the righteous way, what kind of tricks have you adopted to make yourself more comfortable when using Emacs that don&#x27;t involve splurging on super expensive ergonomic keyboards?

 This is a fork of smart-compile, with significant changes and enhancements. It is not in melpa yet. Until I can get it there, feel free to use this directly.

                              <span>Can anyone help me understand LSP and why I’d want it? My probably wrong understanding is that it just moves things like syntax highlighting and tab complete off my local config and onto a remote server. Is that it? If so, what is the appeal? I see nothing but downsides:
  
 what if I’m not online or having network issues?
  remote has to by definition be slower than local
  I don’t control configuration
  I don’t control updates/changes
  at the whims of their choices of tools
  
Is it only used in corporate environments? Am I missing something here?

                              <span>Hi all, I am new to using Doom emacs and emacs in general.
 This question is more for my own knowledge rather than an absolute need.. Is there a way to clear the whole doom emacs history / cache, if not what is the way of doing it manually i.e removing / purging those files that store them so it gets regenerated. I am a bit paranoid in a sense that to know where some stuff is like zshhistory for my zsh.
 Example - Reset Doom emacs remembering Recent files (Space + f + r)
 Update: I figured this much atleast.. that there is a recentf file inside cache directory but there are other files as well which seems a bit scattered but good to know tho.
 Thanks in Advance.

                              <span>I have been dealing with this issue for months, I use straight to manage emacs packages, so that I am always at the latest version of org mode.
 I am currently at org 9.5.3. I have been constantly dealing with a lot of missing function definitions. Most of them are due to compatibility reasons, e.g. some other packages depends on org-mode may use an old name for certain kind of functions. But this should not be an issue at all, because there is an &quot;org-compat.el&quot; which takes care of them.
 However, I find that, org-compat.el was never loaded in my emacs, even though I have (require &#x27;org) in the first place, in org.el, org-compat was already required. I even tried to directly load the org-compat.el myself using (require &#x27;org-compat). But none of the definition in the file was loaded.
 I wonder if that has anything to do with native-compilation. Anyone has an idea of how to fix this issue? I have to manually go to the org-compat.el file every single time after I restart emacs to make it works.
 Not only was org-compat.el not loaded, the org-macs.el was also not loaded. It has become a nightmare for me to use org-mode in the recent months.

                              <span>Dear community,
 AUCTeX and cdlatex are tried and tested packages in supporting the composition of TeX-documents. However, with the advent of LSP-servers, like TexLab and digestif, there is another (viable?) option to compose TeX-documents. 
 What are your experiences with LSP-servers for composing LaTeX? Do you prefer those over AUCTeX? If so, why? 
 Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences.

                              <span>What do you use to show and highlight indent guides?
 So far I&#x27;ve tried these packages, but all of them seems to be missing something:
 Indent guide (https://github.com/zk-phi/indent-guide): 
  
Doesn&#x27;t highlight the indent guide of the current block in a different face of the other lines
 
Doesn&#x27;t keep all the indent guides, only the parents and current block
 
 Highlight indent guides (https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides):
  
Doesn&#x27;t show the indent guide on empty lines
  
Highlight indentation (https://github.com/antonj/Highlight-Indentation-for-Emacs)
  
Doesn&#x27;t highlight the guide of the current block, instead it highlights the whole column
 
Doesn&#x27;t highlight the guide of the block when inside parens
 
 Do you guys use this feature? While searching for a solution, I was surprised that some people wanted to remove it from their editors/IDE.
 Maybe I missing something, so if someone has a suggestion or workaround to get the indent guides like in other editors, I appreciate.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I was trying use emacs for everything so I set up emms for music. It was very cool and had nice cover art thumbnails and so forth. But I had two problems that made me go back to using cmus. First, I couldn&#x27;t get it to work with my media keys, something that works with cmus automatically upon installing (with emms I used (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;emms-pause), which did not work. So I&#x27;d have to have an emacs frame in focus to play and pause. Second, it generated a cache file with metadata for my music that took very long to load on starting emacs as a client and created a big delay shutting down emacs. It was 350mb whereas the cache file for cmus with the metadata for the same Music library was only 7 mbs. I was using emms with mpv. Does anyone know why it generates such a huge cache file? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 Is it possible to generate a clocktable report from an archive file, which take into account the inherited tags (ex: ARCHIVE_ITAGS property) making it possible to match like a regular tag?
 I have multiple org files, one for each client, with an according #+FILETAGS. It would be great to get clocked times per client, without needing to have an archive file per client.
 Is this possible without going into elisp sorcery?
 Or am I doing this wrong?
 Another question: is it possible to match ARCHIVE_CATEGORY properties?
 Thank you

 I use orgzly on my phone and have defined a few &quot;searches&quot; in orgzly&#x27;s search-syntax and now I wonder how to create equivalent searches on my pc.
 So is there a systematic way to translate orgzly&#x27;s search-syntax into something emacs can understand?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>A Lens allows us to view and update a structure s/t in terms of an aspect a/b.
 If two different structures can be viewed in terms of the same aspects a/b, we can model a partial mapping between them. In other words, we can take an s/t structure and alter it with contributions from a u/v structure, OR we can take the u/v structure and alter it with contributions from the s/t.
 Is there a name for this way of combining two lenses?
 Here&#x27;s one implementation:
 -- metaphor :: Lens&#x27; s a -&gt; Lens&#x27; u a -&gt; (s, u) -&gt; (s, u) metaphor :: Lens s t a b -&gt; Lens u v b a -&gt; (s, u) -&gt; (t, v) metaphor ls lu &#x3D; \(s, u) -&gt; (set ls (get lu u) s, set lu (get ls s) u) 
 I&#x27;m calling the combined (s, u) -&gt; (t, v) &quot;metaphor&quot; because to me this looks like this kind of metaphorical thought:
  
An argument is like a building in that both have foundational parts 
 If we reinforce the foundations of a building by adding concrete, it becomes more robust 
 So we can reinforce the foundations of our argument by... to make it more robust
  
I&#x27;ve explored it a little more at this gist https://gist.github.com/gusbicalho/a3a38e07aba55bc69f6f164ddde092f7 but I&#x27;m sure that if this thing is useful at all, someone must have written about it already 😅

This Week
Final week of classes!
My inbox has 12 zettel, and I want to clean-house. It means factoring and refactoring the ideas or abandoning them.
Coding work on ⌃⌥⇧⌘W Writing Tools
First field mowing of the year
Trivia.
A nugget from a zettel I created yesterday. 
Eufriction is Good Friction 202204301205

  
You want process friction when it helps and not when it hinders the nut of a process. We would not want to live in a &quot;friction-free world.&quot; When introducing a new note to our ZK, a little friction to slow us down, to help us reflect more deeply is a good thing.</span>

 I am open for any language and especially doing something in Scala (but not spark). i know it may be a little awkward question, but trying to figure out something efficient and easily maintainable.

Most time you don&#x27;t need that level of abstraction. (i.e. create a Monad and benefit from all the predefined stuff). And yes cats give you lots of interesting transform for free, but it feels most time you just don&#x27;t need them, and when you need them, it&#x27;s straightforward to impl.
 I&#x27;m thinking may be only library developers will need to learn the fancy libraries like cats, does this make sense?
 p.s. could you consider cats is for Scala is like Boost is for C++?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
1. Two things captured my attention. First was the writing and use of humor to deliver the message. The second idea that swirled out of the Ambassador of Cool was the notion of eufriction. @ZettelDistraction lifted it from Bob Doto2, but it would have been lost to me if he hadn&#x27;t shared it here.
Below is a zettel I created from this interaction. I&#x27;ve reproduced it in its entirety so you can laugh, critique, criticize, slam, skip any part or theme in the zettel, or ignore the whole thing.
The numbered entries below are direct quotes from @ZettelDistraction.
I found this along with Bob Doto&#x27;s essay2, a lively ZK exercice. I spent a couple of hours diving deeper into eufriction. Seeing the gaps in my ZK. I have another zettel which is still providing a little eufriction. Maybe I&#x27;…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently learning both emacs and webdev. I&#x27;m trying to not go too far down the emacs configuration and customization rabbit hole out of the gate so that I can actually progress on the odin project. But its too intriguing to not build out some automation and QoL implementations. 
 A recent fix I implemented showed me the power of being able to quickly customize built in or added package functionality to be what I want it to be. But it raised the question on best practices for doing such things. 
 The example in question was navigating tags with web-mode and emmet-mode both enabled. There is some built in navigation for elements but I found one bit confusing/inefficent.
 ex: 
 I use ul&gt;li*5 to make a list with 5 items in it. It smartly jumps between the first 
. I enter some text and use &quot;C-c C-e n&quot; to move to the next element. But its at the start of the next element i.e. before the  probably finding the character with regex or something. I just don&#x27;t know lisp well enough yet. 
 ​
 My next-tag function - very crude just showing a code structure sample.
 (defun next-tag() (interactive) (web-mode-element-next) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char) (forward-char)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x t&quot;) &#x27;next-tag)

                              <span>Since I switched to 29.0.50 emacs-version I decided to give a chance to another built-it Emacs packages. As a long time Vi(m) user I gave a chance to viper-mode. I used a lot evil before and it&#x27;s great, but unexpectedly viper mode does a good job also. Personally I am not a vim hacker, I just frequently use dd, yyp, o and O in command mode and all of this work very smooth. Also in &quot;console&quot; modes (eshell, vterm, shell and ansi-term) I didn&#x27;t encounter major issue. One thing that I added is viper-want-ctl-h-help variable to not-nil because help keybindings (C-h) doesn&#x27;t work by default which I use often. My current configuration: ~/.emacs.d/viper:  (setq viper-inhibit-startup-message &#x27;t) (setq viper-expert-level &#x27;5) (setq viper-want-ctl-h-help &#x27;t)  and in init.el:  (setq viper-mode t) (require &#x27;viper)  I encourage you to try :) link to manual

                              <span>I realize Evil vs. traditional emacs bindings is a thoroughly discussed topic. I&#x27;m currently poring over numerous discussions in a search of this subreddit. But one discussion I haven&#x27;t seen is what set of bindings is best supported/implemented outside of the standard text-editing experience. The discussions naturally tend to focus on which bindings are better for each user for editing text. But what about for everything else? 
 For instance, qutebrowser is a fantastic web-browser built for keyboard focused input. It uses vim style bindings natively, but can be configured to use emacs style bindings (and there exists a community maintained configuration file to do just that). A possible issue however with attempting to use emacs style bindings for qute browser is that any features you do use, such as god-mode, might require significant manual configuration to implement. Firefox has addons for vim style experiences (I haven&#x27;t found an up to date and not abandoned addon for an emacs style experience in firefox). 
 Emacs has its functions for almost everything, including email clients, terminal/shells, and file management. These would naturally tend to be best supported using traditional emacs bindings, because in my experience, evil-mode, while fantastic, often lacks somewhat in documentation for the various things it&#x27;s implemented in. But dedicated applications may offer support for features not easily replicable in emacs currently. 
 Overall, this seems like something of a wash so far. but perhaps I&#x27;m missing something. What has your experience been with emacs or evil bindings outside of emacs?

                              <span>I know there are many posts that are similar but they are dated. Given PGTK and WSL2, technology support has improved I wanted to summarize my experience and get feedback from the community on their experiences in stability and performance. These are now the available methods I see to install Emacs on Windows:
  
Binary from Berkeley FTP (general compilation &amp; slower performance)
 msys2 binary from Berkeley FTP (faster with native compilation)
 Native compilation with &quot;master&quot; release (29.0.x) using msys2 (native compilation with customization + ImagicMagick for eg.)
 WSL2 using package manager (general compilation, no GUI)
 Source compilation on WSL2 (custom compilation, with GUI, uses 2 containers)
  
If using binary on Windows,
  
Fast performance
 Windows support poor in drawing and refresh
 Missing Linux commands produce some inconsistency in experience
  
If compiled or using msys2,
  
Faster performance
 Windows support poor in drawing and refresh
 Instability of Emacs (part native, part cygwin) and missing Linux commands
 Magit is slow
 File access is smooth
  
If WSL2,
  
Slow performance
 Smoother windows performance
 Instability - random crashes
 Magit kicks ass
 Windows files more jarring to access
 Networking issues especially if on a VPN
 Copy and paste is not native (hacks available)
  
The best experience I&#x27;ve had thus far is native compilation of Emacs 29 with msys2, but while the performance is good, I am running into issues with &#x27;Too many files open&#x27; after editing multiple projects (which is not LSP or Magit).
 What&#x27;s working for you?

 I have tried out ses-mode and org-tables but they both seem to have some issues. Which one do you people use?

                              <span>Yep this is a baby question, apologies in advance.
 Started with Emacs only yesterday. Originally briefly used Neovim, later Vscode with Vim keybinds. Needless to say I&#x27;m now using Doom Emacs.
 I&#x27;m totally and utterly new to Doom Emacs, having read and watched nothing but the absolute basics. I&#x27;ve made a small to-do list (in Org mode, yes sir) for myself of things I need to prioritize setting up if I wish to use it as a text editor for work. In the Doom init.el file I&#x27;ve uncommented &quot;:csharp&quot; under languages. Synced and restarted Doom. I now get basic highlighting in cs files, but not much else. I don&#x27;t know what else this does.
 My intuition was to assume it probably didn&#x27;t install omnisharp, so I got the omnisharp-roslyn package from the AUR. Added it to my path. From here on out I&#x27;m not sure what to do. I know I probably need a lsp client, but not much else.
 Any help is appreciated.

Is there something potentially wrong with my setup or is this just how company mode is?
 For comparison: https://i.imgur.com/eE54LAK.png
 Specifically I wanted response. to show the Body function but it wasn&#x27;t showing up and that got me confused.
 Edit: Had to reinstall all LSP packages and now it shows better completions. It seems I have to do this every time I restart emacs which is strange. But at least it&#x27;s moving in the right direction. Thank you all for the replies.

                              <span>Whatever I changed my $HOME/.clang-tidy, the editor always shows the same output.
 For example, I want to hide the diagnostic output like &quot;Parameter name &#x27;xx&#x27; is too short, expected at least 3 characters [readability-identifier-length]&quot; in clang-tidy
 And this is my current clang-tidy --list-checks | grep readability-identifier-length output:
 &gt; clang-tidy --list-checks | grep readability-identifier-length readability-identifier-length 
 and in emacs, flycheck-list-errors shows: flycheck.png
 Now I&#x27;m adding -readability-identifier-length to my $HOME/.clang-tidy file&#x27;s Checks arguments list to disable checking it:
 Checks: &#x27;-*, clang-analyzer-*, readability-*, modernize-*, -clang-analyzer-osx*, -readability-identifier-length &#x27; 
 And below is my current output:
 &gt; clang-tidy --list-checks | grep readability-identifier-length &gt; 
 The check is hidden, so the config file should work after changing, but my flycheck-list-errors output does not change, no matter if I execute lsp-restart-workspace or restart emacs.
 And I&#x27;ve confirmed that there is no other clang-tidy in the parent directory except $HOME/.clang-tidy.
 this is my sysinfo

                              <span>Does anyone have some advice for setting up gnus to read email from Office365/outlook using oauth2? My employer recently switched off basic authentication and helpfully told me to &#x27;get a better email program&#x27; ... what could be better than emacs!
 It seems like emacs should be able to connect using oauth2 (e.g. https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87h7g5llp1.fsf@ust.hk/T/ ). I don&#x27;t want to keep a local copy of all my email, so have been using gnus (which has up to now been working really nicely).
 This guide appears to get the authentication working
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/61060/how-to-make-email-in-emacs-work-with-an-oauth2-requirement
 but attempting to read email through gnus, I then get the helpful error message
 nnimap (work) open error: ‘’. Continue? (y or n) 
 which makes debugging rather difficult.
 Does anyone have a working configuration for reading Office365 (or any imap email with oauth2 authentication)?
 Any suggestions gratefully received!

                              <span>Hi! I have a Monterrey M1 Mac. I used to have iHaskell and life was good, I could follow the tutorials easily. Suddenly it broke. Tried many things, broke it more. 
 I have deleted all the folders generated by GHcup and installed it again. Good. When trying to install IHaskell using this command (within the downloaded folder): &quot;stack install --fast&quot; I get this nasty error:
 Error running clang! you need clang installed to use the LLVM backend
 I do have LLVM installed. As a matter of fact I tried to lower its version to &lt;13; I have this in the path: /usr/local/opt/llvm@12/bin:/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin
 Yet it keeps failing. I don&#x27;t want to give up on Haskell, but it has been a nightmare to have the proper tools working. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I am trying to set the property of DIR for my org-mode buffer/file, and there are two ways to do that:
 Method 1:
 :PROPERTIES:
 :ID: d86af414-2117-41e9-9a62-86c0e85c221f
 :DIR: PATH/TO/DIR
 :END: 
 Method 2:
 #+PROPERTY: DIR PATH/TO/DIR
 Based on the org-mode manual, i thought these two method are the same but seems not. it only works for me with method 1. i wonder if i miss anything or that is expected?

                              <span>It is annoying having to fix broken keybinding configurations or undo keybindings introduced by a package.
 Worse is that this can make your configs package definition order matter which is something I put a lot of effort into preventing.
 If the package author thinks that their keybindings are useful then they should give the user an explicit opt-in setting.
 I don&#x27;t mind built-in packages doing this.

 Hey Org mode lovers,
 In the article Hyperlink (wikipedia) we can read that a hyperlink &quot;is a reference to data that the user can follow by clicking&quot;.
 Do you believe me if I tell you that with Org mode the data we refer to in a link can be a buffer in magit-revision-mode (from magit package) showing us a specific commit of some git repository?
 For a non-Emacs user, it&#x27;s not that you can or can&#x27;t believe it, it&#x27;s just that this sentence doesn&#x27;t make sense.
 But for me (a regular Emacs user like you), when I read that sentence I think:
  
 Really! Emacs, Org, Magit, Buffer, Link! Integration. Non-context swi…</span>

                              <span>I have set my org-agenda-custom-commands to (among others) this:
 &#x60;&#x60;elisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands ( (&quot;x&quot; &quot;Scheduled tasks with Prio&quot; ((tags-todo &quot;+PRIORITY&#x3D;{A}&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Scheduled Prio-A TODOs&quot;) (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;unscheduled)))) (tags-todo &quot;+PRIORITY&#x3D;{B}&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Scheduled Prio-B TODOs&quot;) (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;unscheduled)))) (tags-todo &quot;+PRIORITY&#x3D;{C}&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Scheduled Prio-C TODOs&quot;) (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;unscheduled)))) (tags-todo &quot;+PRIORITY&#x3D;{D}&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Scheduled Prio-D TODOs&quot;) (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;unscheduled)))) (agenda))) ;; snip
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now I would like to hide all tasks scheduled in the future. I can do this via
  (progn (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled &#x27;future) (setq org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options t)) 
 But this affects all of my other org-agenda-custom-commands. I would like to limit it to just one custom command. 
 So how can I modify my custom command so that it hides the future tasks?
 Edit
 I have created a function to toggle future entries, but I&#x27;d like to incorporate it in the custom-command, if possible.
 Here is my function for toggling future items:
 elisp (defun ugt-org-toggle-future-items-in-agenda-view () &quot;Show/hide future items in org-agenda views.&quot; (interactive) (if org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled (progn (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled nil) (setq org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options nil) (org-agenda-redo) (message &quot;Showing future scheduled items in org-agenda.&quot;)) (progn (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled &#x27;future) (setq org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options t) (org-agenda-redo) (message &quot;Hiding future scheduled items in org-agenda.&quot;))))

 What I&#x27;m after is: a way to select a link from the screen (with Avy-hints, like link-hint does), and then use Embark to open said link.
 Before I try to achieve this: this probably has been done before? Or do you have some code or ideas to share?
 (Neither the Wiki&#x27;s of Embark or link-hint, nor DDG&#x27;ing yielded any results...)

 Why to make functions for the stuff already available? why not make your keybindings attach to existing functions?

                              <span>It takes a while to get used to Lisp technology when you&#x27;re not a programmer, and you&#x27;ve only been playing with things like Python for small applications needed for personal use.
 I have a pet project in org-mode that reads some data from a text file and arrange them nicely, but I&#x27;m currently using a way too complex process to do this, involving PostgreSQL that makes my org-mode export kinda slow. I think it would be faster to replace all the SQL quarries with Elisp and that would also reduce my dependence on other software and keep everything within Emacs.
 Basically, I would need three things and if anyone is willing to help me with hints, idea or code snippets, that would be great:
  
Read a text file (over 6000 lines long) in, I suppose, a list; or a list of lists?; the text file is fixed-formatted, ideally the reading process would acknowledge that;
 Count some list elements (atoms, I guess?) and have the results available as variables across the org-mode file;
 Create org-mode tables with list elements of my choosing (n-th elements from the m-th list, p-th elements from q-th list and so on).
  
Is this doable in Elisp?

                              <span>Note: if you just read a paragraph and having no clue what&#x27;s this question is about but you&#x27;d like to learn more; I think this post by Chris Wellons perfectly explains what structs are and why are they useful.
 
 I&#x27;m dealing with a third-party package that uses Structures - cl-defstructs. 
 One of the slots is :read-only t. I need to override that. I need to find a way to change the value in that slot and then pass the structure to a function, essentially &quot;deceiving&quot; that function.
 Let&#x27;s say I have:
 (cl-defstruct (toy (:constructor toy-create) (:copier nil)) (color nil :read-only t)) 
 Somewhere within that third-party package, it creates an instance of toy, e.g.:
 (setq stupid-toy (toy-create :color &#x27;red)) 
 Now, let&#x27;s say I need to change :color to &#x27;green and pass this &quot;new object&quot; into some function.
 I&#x27;d try overriding slot-accessor function - toy-color, right before calling that function:
 (cl-labels ((toy-color (x) &#x27;green)) ;; now, whatever within (break-it) asks for toy&#x27;s color, it should be &#x27;green, right? (funcall &#x27;break-it stupid-toy))) 
 It seems that doesn&#x27;t work. My fake toy-color fn doesn&#x27;t get called. Maybe because :color is read-only?
 What are my options here? I cannot use copy-toy because copier-fn is disabled (see above) Can I create a new struct type that inherits from toy through :include option, but :color no longer read-only?
 How do I create/clone a new struct from the old one?
 Remember, in my example, the struct has only one slot; the real struct type that I&#x27;m dealing with has over dozen of slots - I need to find an elegant way of cloning the struct, changing a single slot value and keeping remaining slots intact.

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and my emacs got updated to 28. Fine, I&#x27;ll bite the bullet and go with it. So I updated all the emacs libs and all seems to be okay.
 Except my org-mode capture seems to be broken. I have clock-in enabled in my template, but after entering all the data and C-c C-c, I get this:
 ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: :END: 
 In other words, the CLOCK: line is missing from :LOGBOOK:
 It used to be:
 ** Test :2022:2022_04:MORE:TAGS: :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2022-04-28 Thu 12:25]-- :END: 
 or something like that (can&#x27;t reproduce), but the CLOCK line was added with the current time as the start time. Any ideas on what might be wrong? The template is defined as:
 (&quot;h&quot; &quot;Hours&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/Data/hours/log.org&quot; &quot;Hours 2022&quot;) &quot;* %? :%:%:%^g\n&quot; :clock-in t :clock-keep t :empty-lines-after 1) 
 And yeah, no clock has been started. Pressing C-c C-x C-o tells me so...
 Another small but quite annoying change is that on starting the capture I get a prompt to select tags. It used to be that pressing TAB after some characters would autocomplete the TAG and add a trailing colon (:) which made it possible to immediately select another TAG. It now only completes the TAG, so I need another action to start typing the start of the next TAG which is annoying. Any way to get the old behaviour back?

                              <span>I remember having read about a tool (package, some elisp on a blog post, not sure) that enabled one to help evaluate options eg. during a meeting.
 Essentially the way it worked: one would create a few entries in orgmode, add some semi-freeform attributes (eg. &#x27;price:25&#x27;) in their text body, and the tool would extract these formatted tags and summarize then into an org table. The use case was to help decide on several options with many criteria while discussing them.
 That&#x27;s all I remember, and I did not find that thing (attribute, table, summarize, chose are too generic). I found org-choose.el and org-collector.el but they don&#x27;t work on the inline type of attribute.
 anyone knows that thing? Otherwise I&#x27;ll have to roll-up my sleeves and start elisping...

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have the following ADT:
 data Method &#x3D; Move | Say | Attack deriving (Show, Eq) 
 and a function that pattern matches on this ADT:
 perform :: Method -&gt; IO () perform (Move) &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Moving forward...&quot; perform (Say) &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Saying something...&quot; perform (Attack) &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Swinging sword...&quot; 
 Now, let&#x27;s assume that I want to add another function that &quot;overrides&quot; the behavior of perform but only on specific cases. For example:
 moveSlowly :: Method -&gt; IO () moveSlowly (Move) &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Slowly moving forward...&quot; moveSlowly m &#x3D; perform m 
 This pattern is known as the Decorator Pattern in OOP languages.
 Is there a way for me to generalize this behavior and possibly even compose these &quot;overriding&quot; functions? For example, let&#x27;s say I have another function:
 attackWithAxe :: Method -&gt; IO () attackWithAxe (Attack) &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Swinging axe...&quot; attackWithAxe m &#x3D; perform m 
 Ideally I would be able to &quot;compose&quot; these 3 functions using something like
  moveSlowly  attackWithAxe  perform 
 preferring the first match found from left to right.
  
One possibility is to create a record of functions where each field corresponds with one constructor. I turn perform into a record with the default implementation and then I can override each behavior at will using a record update. When I actually want to perform an action just I extract the function from the final record.
 This kind of works, but implies code duplication (ADT constructors &#x3D; Record labels) and I&#x27;m not sure how to &quot;compose&quot; from left to right.
  
Thanks to @MorrowM_ for the recommended design. An example app is available here: https://github.com/emlautarom1/HaskellSnippets/blob/master/Decorator.hs

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m writing a client codegen for a Servant API definition. I get all the types that appear somewhere in API definition and generate their definitions in the target language.
 However, I have a problem getting type parameters from the generic representation of types.Specifically, when I have
 data Rec a &#x3D; Rec { field1 :: [a] } deriving Generic1 data RecInt &#x3D; RecInt { field1 :: [Int] } deriving Generic, 
 the kinds Rep (Rec Int) and Rep RecInt are exactly the same (modulo type/constructor names). The problem is when my codegen sees the type Rec Something in the API definitions, it doesn&#x27;t know from the Rep type that a parametric foreign datatype is needed. I could, in principle, generate two datatypes, i.e. Rec_Int and Rec_Text, from Typeable &#x27;s typeRepArgs but it doesn&#x27;t seem elegant for me. Is there any way to peek type parameters from datatype?

                              <span>I made a post about this over a year ago and there were a few people interested, but nobody followed through and contributed to the project so I&#x27;m back again to find fresh faces that might be interested :)
 This is for a game called PlanetSide 1 which has officially shut down, but is now a community made emulator being written in Scala. This game is an MMOFPS and is being built to work with the retail client of the game with no access to the original source code. It&#x27;s amazing how much the small group of devs have done in their free time to get the game to where it is now, but there are some elusive bugs that have been problematic (plus a number of features to still implement). We&#x27;d love for it to be an MMO again, but more dev support seems to be the only way to make that a possibility with limited time of the 2-3 devs.
 Here&#x27;s where you could come in. The repo is here: https://github.com/psforever/PSF-LoginServer I&#x27;m not one of the devs working on the server code due to lacking those skills, but I am involved in the team and help where I can and can get anyone in touch with the right people to get plugged in and up to speed. The community Discord is also here: https://discord.gg/0nRe5TNbTYoUruA4
 How to make it sound more enticing... Do you want 100s or 1000s of people thanking you for your amazing dev skills to make this once flourishing game be populated again with players from around the globe? Do you want to see your code come alive and potentially break the Guinness World record for the largest FPS battle (current record is the game&#x27;s sequel PlanetSide 2 at 1158 players)? Do you want to challenge yourself and put one more feather in your cap and resume that will definitely get you that next 6 figure gig? Join us

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create anki decks (using anki-editor.el) with code snippets in Org mode where the front side of the card is the code snippet and the back side is the output. I would like to have syntax highlighting offered by an Org Babel src block and then when I evaluate the src block have its output appear under a new subheading representing the back of the card. As it stands the output is evaluated under the #+RESULTS drawer in the same subheading and thus on the front side of the card. Is it possible to achieve what I want?
 On a related note, if I evaluate a snippet of (python) code which I know will produce an error in the python REPL this error does not appear in the #+RESULTS drawer. Is it possible to make it appear there?

 We use mostly Typelevel stack (Cats, Cats Effect, Http4s, Fs2, etc.) with a few Haskell services for CLI tooling and parsing/interpreting internal DSLs.
 I&#x27;m the architect on the team, so DM me with any questions.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve converted a pdf file containing a table into a text file and try to parse the lines into a structured object. So there is no field separator other than space or eol :-| That&#x27;s the problem!!!
 To illustrate the problem, I&#x27;ve build here after a simplified example of a line with a label and a double.
 The (simplified) line contains a (fairly) complex label with commas, alphanum characters, space, and periods followed by a double. No way I do it, the label parser is too greedy and consumes the double in the last position:
 parseTest labelP &quot;a label with digits, comas and dots, followed by a float 4  1.12&quot;
 $ unexpected end of input : expecting a word, aFloat, or white space
 The parser should not take 1.12.
 Could you please, tell me where I&#x27;m wrong ?
 Thanx 
 And here is a snipset of the code.
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} module Main where import Data.Char (isAlphaNum, isDigit) import Text.Megaparsec import Data.Void (Void) import Data.Text (Text) import qualified Data.Text as T type Parser &#x3D; Parsec Void Text labelP &#x3D; T.intercalate &quot; &quot;  (word &#x60;sepBy1&#x60; spaceChar)  satisfy (&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27; &#x27;) dotChar &#x3D; T.singleton  satisfy (&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;.&#x27;) isCharLabel :: Char -&gt; Bool isCharLabel c &#x3D; c &#x60;elem&#x60; listChars || isAlphaNum c where listChars :: String listChars &#x3D; &quot;,.&quot; isFloat :: Parser Text isFloat &#x3D; takeWhile1P (Just &quot;aFloat&quot;) isDigit &lt;* dotChar &lt;* satisfy isDigit

 This helps to get to grips with what language extensions are in use in multiple packages, and you can also compare this to the extension sets that GHC2021, Haskell2010 and Haskell98 provide via flags.
 If there are any bugs or useful features to add then either create an issue (or an MR :)
 Hope you find it useful!

 Aside from being a neat of doing variable substitution, zonk&#x27;s type is really general. Could it have other uses?

 Any ideas why - is there just way more demand for Spark Scala?
 I’m a BE engineer who wants to move to contracting for more money and flexibility, but the Scala pickings are slim unless it’s Spark.

                              <span>Hello, 
this is a paragraph talking about spiders:
https://cehs.unl.edu/kiewra/soar/
Spiders have two body parts: the head and chest. They have eight legs and eight eyes. They do not have wings or antennae. Their skeleton is a hard, outer shell that protects them.
my problem is about, How can I correctly apply Zettelkasten?
 

when it comes to associating them with each other, Should I make links for the association? 
Should I consider the whole thing one Zettelkasten note and make a template for my workflow?
I know I ask a lot because I feel lost
by the way, I use obsidian for note-taking.</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone  ! 
Writting, whatever we write fiction or non-fiction, is also a matter of technic and language mastery. But what does that mean &quot;language mastery&quot; ? Is it a talent to use awesome rare words ? I don&#x27;t think so. From my point of view (which is questionnable, as the rest of my further presentation), it depends on a lot of factors and one them is the accurate choose of words.
Intro : lexicons and my works
While writing my novel in French,  I&#x27;ve found myself stuck in search of synonyms, words, expressions, a never ending quest for using lively semantic fields of words. This is a wast of time : while in search, my ideas fade away. It is especially prononced when I write about feelings, like the love story from my novel. I have made researches about love itself, but not about the wa…</span>

                              <span>I got this book two hours ago, zoomed through and finished reading. There are some good bits here, for sure: I will certainly pay more attention to headings in my notes. Also, for the intended audience of that book---students who must study for a test, and need to learn that material---it is likely useful and a good read. I might even recommend it to a high schooler.
That said, my note&#x27;s title is from the perspective of what utility I perceived for me.  The advice seemed pat, too cut-and-dried, proclaimed with a finality that stuck the wrong cord in me. When I read the bibliography, I found something very curious for a book from 2018: the references by decade are: 7 from 2010s, 39 from 2000s, 62 from 1990s, 50 from 1980s, 18 from 1970s. Nothing wrong with old references: I have cited 19th century books often enough and once a 17th century book in a paper in computer science, but the relative balance caught my eye.  These 80s/90s skew is curious, although a tad more explained by the original date of publication (2007). Surely more ink has been spilled on this topic this decade, some refining the cited works, others casting grave doubt on some other cited works? FWIW, I have a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and am quite familiar with some lines of research here and which I find rather dubious (won&#x27;t name names, sorry).
So, some good stuff here,  no doubt about it, great material for a longish blog post, but the hefty 250+ pages that it is is a stretch.
I normally don&#x27;t write bad reviews, preferring to keep my mouth shut. But this has been strongly recommended here---enough for me to purchase this---so I felt obliged to add a counter argument.  Just my 2¢.

However, soon after introducing this change, Mituharu disabled it by default. Previous thread discussing it can be found Emacs Mac with Metal Support. I wonder what&#x27;s the status of this feature now? Is there perhaps some benchmarks we can run?

                              <span>I thought I&#x27;d update the organisation of my config and store everything under ~/.config/emacs in what seems to be the modern way. I did that and removed ~/.emacs.d/ altogether. The first time I start emacs everything is fine. However, ~/.emacs.d is recreated and I get a session file and auto-save directory in there. The next time I start the init file isn&#x27;t read at all. Removing ~/.emacs.d and restarting fixes that. I could put a symlink in ~/.emacs.d but that doesn&#x27;t seem right -- what am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Hello,
 While I appreciate the support in Emacs for emoji, it looks kinda funky in context with monospace fonts. Is there a way to make the glyphs skinny so they fit in with the text font I have?

                              <span>Apart from using it to browse web pages, people use it for various web apps:
 word, spreadsheets, calculator, photo tools, games etc. 
 Since chrome is a javascript interpreter at its core (like emacs is for lisp) , people extend it/ abuse it to perform so many things in chrome itself using web applications. 
 I always kind of disliked web apps and since my intro to linux, I have found many command line tools to replace some of them and they are so much better. So I guess, while chrome does a &quot;good enough&quot; job being a general purpose workspace for most people, other user friendly or &quot;FOSS&quot; applications would do a better job.

 Suggestions? This is primarily for my friend, so his needs trump all y&#x27;all&#x27;s opinions ;-) but I wouldn&#x27;t mind some good suggestions. Anything good that I&#x27;m missing? (Aside: &quot;y&#x27;all&#x27;s&quot; is a neat pseudo-word because it has two apostrophes!)
 I recognize a lot of this is taste and semi-subjective, but if there&#x27;s something that helped make the learning curve a little gentler, I&#x27;d be happy to hear it.

                              <span>I actually feel like this question will get my head chopped off but here it goes. How do you actually send pull requests in projects like emacs and org-mode which use the mailing lists instead of hosted vcs solutions like github, gitlab or gitea. I know it is a trivial thing for the veterans of opensource but I&#x27;m of that generation that uses the github type solutions which can handle issue tracking and pull requests in an obvious manner. I&#x27;m not trying to compare or complain the two types of development but I honestly could not find any resource that explains how to contribute using mailing lists for first timers . Reporting issues is obvious enough but how does one get started with submitting patches or sending pull requests.

 I understand the concept, move ctrl closer to the keys, but since I use different keyboards and my work os is Windows and I don&#x27;t have admin rights to the computer, would moving the ctrl key get confusing muscle memory wise?

                              <span>Nickel, a configuration language that we are developing at Tweag,
strives to provide first-class data validation. Nickel does so thanks to its
contract system (although contracts are useful beyond data validation). While
the whole story is more involved, contracts can be loosely seen as validation
functions. They can be nicely combined using built-in constructors: one can form
record contracts, array contracts, function contracts, and more.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand functors well since I&#x27;ve read they are important to understanding Monoids and had a thought that I&#x27;m not sure is accurate. Is it accurate to view functors as much relating to the map function as it is to relate it to the idea of a map such as a hash map? Functors are almost always explained and shown examples with the map function because obviously a functor defines it&#x27;s mappable behavior when the map function is applied to it. But my understanding of functors as a type where when a function is applied to it, it morphs the underlying data and returns a functor of the same type seems to me like a map structure where the keys are the f a and the f b are the values. Does that sound reasonable or am I misunderstanding functors in a bad way?

                              <span>I’ve been thinking a lot about Haskell pedagogy. The best way to learn something is to at some point do something that applies the new knowledge. To learn Haskell is to learn for a purpose. That purpose could be just to understand functional programming or computer science in the abstract, yet even that eventually requires application of concepts at some level. 
 There is another variant of the posted question which is, what domain was the catalyst for you learning Haskell (either because of a compelling application or just because you could)? Understanding either variant of this question can lead to a pedagogical approach focusing on teaching Haskell+application as a way to jump start intuition and to understand the language’s patterns and capabilities for newer learners and seasoned learners alike.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using stack together with VSCode for a while now without any problems. Today i opened up a stack project to my Error highlighting not working and a popup saying &quot;Project requires HLS but it isn&#x27;t installed&quot;, with a button labeled &quot;install HLS&quot; leading to the GHCup page. As far as i know GHCup shouldn&#x27;t be necessary and it worked fine till now without it. The description of the Haskell package in VSCode says i just need to have stack in my path for stack-based packages, which i have. So i have no clue what&#x27;s going on. Should i just install GHCup in parallel to Stack?

                              <span>there are lots of options to introduce mutable state to a haskell program like TVar, MVars and IORefs.
 i was looking about how to use them and i am somewhat confused, it seems that at least for IORefs to access the mutable state from a parent do block say i have
 main:: IO () main &#x3D; do myIORef &lt;- newIORef &quot;hello world&quot; useIORef useIORefAgain 
 this doesn&#x27;t work and to work these IO actions would need to be modified to accept a IORef as argument, i may be missing something but at least that seems unnecessary it seems like i could just have code like
 main:: IO () main &#x3D; do let myValue &#x3D; &quot;hello world&quot; myNewValue &lt;- useMyValue myValue useMyValueAgain myNewValue 
 compared to 
 main:: IO () main &#x3D; do myIORef&lt;- newIORef &quot;hello world&quot; useIORef myIORef useIORefAgain myIORef 
 but obviously IORefs exist for a reason, what makes the second example different third ? what is the problem IORefs solve?

There are probably a lot of caveats with GHC itself on ARM that I won&#x27;t go into detail here, maybe u/angerman can say more. The ghcup binaries itself have been built on a Fedora ARM docker image, so there&#x27;s no static linking yet (needs a bootstrapped alpine arm GHC first, which we don&#x27;t have).

 I have tried lts for ghc-9.0.2 previously and it worked. Has anyone had such problems before? Full output with --verbose: gist
 I know that stack complains at the beginning with Stack has not been tested with GHC versions above 9.0, and using 9.2.2, this may fail, but I hoped that it could work nevertheless.

                              <span>We are happy to announce a Release for the new major version release for the VSCode Haskell Extension!
 This release will allow you to use the latest HLS (1.7.0.0) version.
 Many developers have contributed new features, and this announcement tells you about the latest and greatest changes!
 Previously, VSCode downloaded new HLS binaries automatically. The big new exciting change is that we now use GHCup and can manage the following Haskell Tools for you: HLS, GHC, stack and cabal. To install HLS binaries automatically, make sure you have ghcup installed!
 The first time you use the new Extension you will be asked whether you want to manually manage your Haskell Toolchain binaries or GHCup should take care of it as it sees fit.
 The choice you have:

                              <span>What can F-algebras do better than folds/direct recursion? I don&#x27;t see any significant advantage so far. F-algebras are just a generalization of a fold, that requires that nasty deeply nested Fix embedding from an input structure we&#x27;re folding AND additional type parameter to the data type. Doesn&#x27;t it have the same power as folds? it looks fun, but I don&#x27;t see any advantage so far.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working on a compiler project managed using Stack. As it&#x27;s currently set up, I have test-specific dependencies (e.g., hspec etc.) attached to each test suite, rather than declared as a dependency of the compiler itself. The project is hosted on GitHub and I set up some workflows to run tests for PRs etc.
 However, I&#x27;ve encountered a number of pain points during the development process relating to building and testing:
  
CI takes a really long time to run (5min for what is still a small project). It spends most of its time rebuilding all of the dependencies. I tried cacheing it according to advice I found here, which helps with just a plain stack build step, but Stack still seems to insist on rebuilding all the test dependencies every time the action is run.
 
stack test tries to rebuild the whole project after I run stack build, eating into local development speed. This is an open issue. The suggested workaround of building with --test --no-run-tests still incurs noticeable build time overhead because it also rebuilds all the test suites.
 
 I&#x27;m wondering if folks here have suggestions for best practices for setting up Stack projects, with respect to improving build times for both CI and local testing? Or if people could point me to well-established Haskell projects managed with Stack, that I could look to as examples? (A lot of the bigger projects I&#x27;ve looked at seem to either use just Cabal, or use Stack + Nix.)

                              <span>This is a casual question, I was wondering how other people have their code editing environment setup for Haskell.
 For example, I use a mix of Vscode and Sublime 3 (I paid for my Sublime license so I feel like using it still). My setup is pretty vanilla, I have syntax highlighting and I use the terminal panel to run ghci or cabal repl. I also use the code snippets feature to autocomplete things like language extensions and deriving statements.
 I am curious about what other quality of life features other people are using.

 The specific error I keep running into is:
 /usr/bin/env: ‘node’: No such file or directory 
 when I try to run tsserver...
 Here is what I did to get some of the stuff I need from path..
 (setq exec-path (append &#x27;(&quot;/usr/local/bin&quot;) exec-path)) (setq exec-path (append &#x27;(&quot;~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.15.0/bin&quot;) exec-path)) 
 Anyone got any suggestions on what I can do to fix this ??

 Hey Emacser,
 I hope you are doing well :)
 In this post (2022-04-04) we talked about search options in file links, link abbreviations and the implementation of the command org-open-at-point.
 My goal was to walk the path from pressing RET (if you have org-return-follows-link set to t) or C-c C-o on top of the abbreviated org link
 [[emacs:lisp/simple.el::(defun next-error (&amp;optional]] 
 to the file lisp/simple.el in the Emacs source code (cloned locally) with the point at the beginning of the function next-error.
 We have seen that this path follows the following &quot;call stack&quot;:

I need this especially for temporary buffers that do not have a file (I know that I can create a temporary file, but I would like to avoid this if possible).
 I couldn&#x27;t find a way to do so. Even in eshell, when I try something like cmd  I get Eshell does not support input redirection.

 What is the difference between them? I understand checking out a new branch as making a copy of the current branch and working on it.
 But when you create a new branch or a spin-out are you creating a branch linked to nothing at all, like a branch empty of any code at all?

                              <span>I set up Emacs to develop in Kotlin. So far everything is working fairly well using lsp-mode, kotlin-mode, etc.
 However, the biggest missing piece is the repo I&#x27;m working on has an XML file which defines code formatting styles for IntelliJ.
 Is there any way to get Emacs to look at those for formatting? I was able to do that on previous projects with Prettier for JS, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything for IntelliJ code style files.

 (specifically bwbasic)
 Is there a place where elisp scripts are shared or do they tend to be special-purpose mostly?

                              <span>I just migrated from Linux to Mac. I&#x27;m using the setting display-line-numbers-type &#x27;visual. On Linux, my line numbers were aligned fine, but on Mac they are misaligned as seen in this picture (using the same config):
 https://preview.redd.it/qi0cj866a0w81.png?width&#x3D;454&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;34c991504bba747e74437db9fa1a992e5b9beda3
 Note, the display-line-numbers-width setting doesn&#x27;t fix this, increasing it just shifts the misalignment to the right.
 The only other relevant configuration I&#x27;m using is global-display-line-numbers-mode.

                              <span>I tried out PGTK on the master branch to see how native wayland is coming along, but was very disappointed. There&#x27;s extreme lag when moving the mouse around between items in dashboard-mode (they&#x27;re supposed to be highlighted when hovering over them, but this highlighting is laggy), and my CPU usage spikes when i move the cursor around a lot (eg, by holding down an arrow key) in a buffer. Does this happen to everyone? I am also using native compilation.

One thing I would like it to do is to show all headlines before I type anything, so that it serves as an alternative to imenu. Would anyone know if helm-org-rifle can be customized to do that? or will I need to hack it somehow?

                              <span>My goal here is to consume the string &quot;meow&quot; and then a single whitespace afterwards. I used for that purpose the function  Parser[String] &#x3D; _.r def word_whitespaces: String &#x3D;&gt; Parser[String] &#x3D; word(_) &lt;~ word(&quot; &quot;) object Testing extends SimpleParser: def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; print(parse(word_whitespaces(&quot;meow&quot;),&quot;meow and then wof&quot;)) 
 My goal from in this is not the parser itself, but understanding &lt;~ which I think I do.
 But it seems that word_whitespaces is checking the string starting from &quot;and&quot; without minding the whitespace, which I concluded by seeing this:
 [1.6] failure: string matching regex &#x27; &#x27; expected but &#x27;a&#x27; found
 meow and then wof
 Why isn&#x27;t the parser matching with the whitespace, and instead skipping to &quot;and&quot;? It seems as if the whitespace after matching with a regular expression is perceived as delimiter, which I didn&#x27;t directly asked for it to be the case.

                              <span>Since I have only 1 scheduling file, some information is redundant. What would work best for me is the following format:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Friday 29 April 2022 TAG1 TODO task for the day 1 TAG2 TODO task for the day 2 Saturday 30 April 2022 TAG1 TODO task for the day 1 TAG2 TODO task for the day 2
  I can achieve that with the following:  (setq org-agenda-prefix-format &#x27;( (agenda . &quot; %-12T&quot;) )) (setq org-agenda-remove-tags t) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This hides file info, puts the tag at the beginning, hides the tag at the end. The only thing missing is changing the font of tag, so instead of it being regular, green, I&#x27;d like it to be black. Is there a var which I could target?

 is quite clunky:  8:00...... ---------------- 10:00...... ---------------- 12:00...... ---------------- todo: 13:00-14:00 Scheduled: TODO call domas after lunch 14:00...... ---------------- 14:26...... now - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 16:00...... ---------------- 18:00...... ---------------- 20:00...... ---------------- todo: Scheduled: TODO task without time 
 I would instead like it to show the default view - 1 line per task, just with time info. Is it possible to do with some setting?

                              <span>I want to integrate Org with a custom software that I have an API available. Basically I want to see the information I can fetch from this software integrated in Org Agenda.
 My idea is create a FUSE application that reads from the API and presents its contents as a &quot;virtual org file&quot;, a file that appears like a normal file but it is implemented via FUSE. Is this approach too overkill or should I just go ahead and implement it? I have nothing to lose and this is a personal endeavor, this is not from my main job or something very important at all.

                              <span>Hi there, would you mind if I ask you guys is there a code interview, such as the common algorithm test in a Scala engineer interview? If I apply for a functional programmer, is there a chance the interviewer ask me to write some leetcode tests? If so, how should I prepare it. Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to functional programming and wondering what design patterns I need to study to be able to create a progress bar.
 For instance, assume you&#x27;re writing a Haskell console application to calculate the pixels of a fractal flame, that you call from a GTK+ or Flutter GUI desktop art app. If you want the GUI app to be able poll the Haskell app for progress and display the current iteration of the image on the screen, how would you do that?
 In imperative code I could make the image calculator run only 10 iterations of the main loop at a time, return the loop number, image contents, and time elapsed to the calling app. Then either continue or stop the calculation based on the calling app&#x27;s response.
 But functional programming has no loops, no iteration counter, and no way to stop a function once it has begun, as far as I know with my beginner understanding.
 Is such a thing possible? What is it called in FP speak? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up elfeed-score for some arXiv feeds -- in the manner of this blog post. The scoring and sorting work out great, but the adjust-tags rule (described here) for labeling posts which have a score higher or lower than a certain threshold seems to be failing.
 This is in my score file:
  (&quot;adjust-tags&quot; (:threshold (t . 1000) :tags (t . (starred)) :comment &quot;READ&quot;) (:threshold (nil . -100) :tags (t . (terrible) :comment &quot;DON&#x27;T READ&quot;) )) 
 What this should do is:
  
tag posts with a score greater than or equal to 1000 as starred
 tag posts with a score less than or equal to -100 as terrible
  
What ends up happening is that:
  
all posts are tagged as starred
 posts with a score less than or equal to -100 are tagged as terrible as well as starred
  
The value of elfeed-score-serde-adjust-tags-rule (the only related variable I can find) is:
 (#s(elfeed-score-adjust-tags-rule :threshold (t . 1000) :tags (t starred) :comment nil) #s(elfeed-score-adjust-tags-rule :threshold (nil . -100) :tags (t terrible) :comment nil)) 
 This doesn&#x27;t seem to change when I update the rule to e.g. make the starred threshold 2000. 
 Can&#x27;t quite work out where this is going wrong. I thought I&#x27;d ask before I open an issue on GitHub.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 11 years. I&#x27;m not a programmer but an ordinary business-type who values Emacs mainly for Org. However, I have taught myself Elisp and have gone down the rabbit hole of customizing Emacs extensively. 
 It&#x27;s my sense that the Emacs &quot;ecosystem&quot; is growing and innovating at a very healthy clip. The richness of ELPA, the frequency of new releases from the core developers, and the adoption of Emacs/Org in places like academia -- all these are examples.
 This appears to be happening in the world of professional coding too, despite very capable competitors like VS Code. Here&#x27;s a recent quote from Jon Sander&#x27;s blog, irreal.org: &quot;The fact — as evidenced by Org-mode and Magit — is that Emacs is at the forefront of editor/IDE development.&quot; 
 Ponder that: &quot;at the forefront.&quot; 
 I have no data on the actual number of Emacs users, or on the rate of production of new packages or counts of new lines of code, but it&#x27;s my anecdotal sense that Emacs is modernizing and thriving. Not least, its reach is extending beyond the English-speaking world. 
 Is this the golden age of Emacs? Was it ever better than now?

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m getting two messages on startup and I can&#x27;t figure out where they are coming from. 
 First, I use auto package update and it opens a buffer called package update results that just says every package I use fails to update. A snippet of the buffer:
 Error installing better-shell Error installing auto-package-update Error installing ansible Error installing all-the-icons-dired 
 It is triggered by these two lines in my settings file:
 (package-refresh-contents) (auto-package-update-now) 
 I can run package-reinstall successfully for the packages. Some time ago, I did try set it to straight.el and switched back, I think that&#x27;s when I started seeing this. I triple checked there&#x27;s no straight.el references.
 My second issue is I get this in the warning buffer:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install image: Package ‘image-’ is unavailable 
 I can&#x27;t find anything for image- in my emacs directory:
 ~/.emacs.d master* 1m 15s ❯ ag use-package | grep image- ~/.emacs.d master* 
 Any ideas are greatly appreciated, thanks.

 In it we&#x27;re walked through setting up typescript for lsp (theia-ide) and the company package for better completions. My setup code block is at the bottom and my lsp log for some reference.
 I open a typescript test file to see if lsp is auto loading and if its actually working.
 I get some sort of scanning animation on the far right of my bar with no indication of what it is but its only in lsp mode. You can see one frame of animation from this line pulled from my buffer list. Sometimes instead there is no scan line.
 My two main issues are

                              <span>I was looking to use an alternative layout for evil mode keys (remapping most keys except for symbols), favoring more logical groupings &amp; placement over VIM&#x27;s mnemonics.
 While I&#x27;ve have this working well enough to be usable, getting this working properly is quite involved given the number of key-maps there are which are layered on top of each other.
 Currently I&#x27;m clearly the key-maps and re-populating them to avoid accidentally using existing key-map entries, but there are quite a few keys to map.
 Has anyone managed a comprehensive remapping of evil-mode keys before? Any suggestions for an approach that works well?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to automatically associate new buffers with tab bars, e.g. by re-using an existing tab bar for all buffers of some kind, or by opening a new one if there is none yet associated with it. I wanted it to be rather primitive, so I do not want to install an extra package, if possible. I thought a perfect way to implement this would be using display-buffer-alist, but a quick browse of the manual reveals there&#x27;s noting tab bar specific in there. Any thought how I could hack my way nonetheless?

                              <span>I prefer a clean frame for Emacs, so I&#x27;ve set frame-title-format to be empty, but whenever I resize the frame, the size of the frame is appended to the frame title. If I :Eval (setq frame-title-format &quot; &quot;) the frame-title is cleared. I&#x27;ve checked and that should be the equivalent of eval-expression, but doing (eval-expression &#x27;(setq frame-title-format &quot; &quot;)) in a hook does nothing. Using setq directly also does nothing. So what&#x27;s the difference between eval-expression and :Eval? Or, what&#x27;s the difference between running a command immediately and running a command via hooks?
 I&#x27;ve also tried (set &#x27;frame-title-format &quot; &quot;) thinking it&#x27;s a scope-issue, but no luck

                              <span>Coming from vim, now I realise emacs is not just a text editor. It is a lisp interpreter and thus functions like an OS from which you can do several different things and thus use your common key binds etc across several different applications. 
 ​
 Is there any other program which does this? I am not looking for an alternative. I am just curious as I never came across such a program before and why isn&#x27;t this more common? Like there could be python based or C based emacs-like programs, right?

                              <span>​At my day job I work on a 35 year old product with literally a few hundred million lines of codes. It is essentially a mono-repo. 
 There are thousands of directory trees with Makefiles. To be consistent with Emacs concepts, let&#x27;s call these &#x27;projects&#x27;. Luckily projects are rarely nested, and not in the areas I work on. There is no discipline requiring file names be unique across projects, nor even within projects. Furthermore, within any project there can be multiple unittest/ and/or pkgtest/ directories. Each such directory must contain a suite_registration.cpp. 
 Most often I work within a single project and want to navigate to files in the same project. Less frequently I need to find a file in a sibling project. Unfortunately, there are ~400 siblings, though I very rarely visit more than 10. 
 With recent attempts to work within Emacs&#x27; built-in tools, I wonder how I find files in this code base. Or if Emacs lacks adequate built-in tooling, what package(s) might​ help?

                              <span>Most of us are familiar with tree-style thinking that org-mode seamlessly enables, where a parent node has an infinite amount of tree children. From a gardening perspective this works great if you&#x27;re not breeding and instead just saving seed, as you can structure the data as follows, where each subheading is a genetic descendant of the parent:
 ​
 ** San Marzano Tomato
 :PROPERTIES:
 :WHATEVER: WHATEVER
 :END:
 *** Plant 1
 :ID: sjkjlfkjh
 :YIELD: Xlbs
 [inline image]
 notes
 *** Plant 2
 :ID: oijiohiuhi
 :YIELD: Ylbs
 [inline image]
 notes
 **** Plant 2, Gen 1
 etc
 ​
 So I use emacs and org-mode for everything (of course), and being able to snap pics and add properties on the fly would be AMAZING for organizing anything cultivation related with minimal friction/overhead. Where organization and documentation tends to be most important is in breeding, and I&#x27;m unsure how I&#x27;d represent say a San Marzano and Roma cross elegantly. Of course I could create a new tree for each cross, but I recall reading org having some functionality (probably using tags and unique ID&#x27;s) to make this seamless or somehow superior, I believe it was presented as a sort of directed acyclic graph using tags. Using org-mode at all for this would be great since HTML exports would be a freebie.
 ​
 This isn&#x27;t complicated, but I&#x27;m just wondering how you might organize something like this so I don&#x27;t have an &#x27;a-ha&#x27; moment later and decide to restructure everything (but who am I kidding.. that&#x27;s half the fun). I&#x27;m sort of thinking a tree per cross may end up best, since it&#x27;ll work most naturally with org-mode, and the top level node can include inline images of each parent in the cross, and properties like :ID-FATHER:, :ID-MOTHER: etc.

I am procrastinating writing an assignment that is due in a few hours, so I thought I&#x27;d create a little video on how I zettelkast.
Let me know if you want more like this. Me wresting in real-time, taking a new idea and seeing where I can connect it to established ideas to strengthen them, question them, advocate for or against them, and reconcile them. I have a few other tricks for finding connections, but I was running out of time and energy. I had fun doing this once I got into it, finding some reinforcing ideas.
Background
I tried to keep the content as application-agnostic as I could. The subject of the video is Effective Notetaking (2nd ed) by Fiona McPherson, 2014. One of the ideas she writes about is when highlighting is effective and when it is not. I show how this i…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;m writing a parser in Haskell. The first step is to tokenize, so I have a Token type and my tokenize function returns a list of Tokens. My parse function takes that list of Tokens and does the parsing using mainly pattern matching returning a parse tree and the tokens it could not parse.
  data Token &#x3D; Lambda | Dot | LParen | RParen | Ident String deriving Show 
 So now, I realized the error messages I can generate are terrible because while I have the tokens where the problems begin, I have no idea where in the source file the tokens come from. The way I would solve this in an OO language is that I would add some fields to Token listing things like source file, column and line.
 So I tried something like:
  data Position &#x3D; Pos String Int Int 
 and then
  data Token &#x3D; Lambda Position | Dot Position | LParen Position | RParen Position | Ident String Position deriving Show 
 But this is just awful. Now, my parse function is broken because all my pattern matches are wrong. What&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; way to do this? Ideally, my parse function wouldn&#x27;t have to change much, after all, none of this extra data matters to it.

                              <span>Hi all, I was wondering if any of you had any fast keybdinding for everyday actions that are very frequently used. 
 ​
 I am trying to find the keybindings that better fit my workflow but I&#x27;m really struggling with it: what I&#x27;m setting up is a very simple markdown editor and there are 4 things that i always do (bold text, italic text, math text, code text) but i just realized that the C-c prefix combinations are sooo slow for me. 
 ​
 What i usually did with traditional editors was something like C-b (bold) and C-i (italic) so i was insanely fast at it. I see that many keybindings besides the C-c prefix are already taken and it looks like overriding those is frowned upon. (Plus, C-i is basically ). 
 ​
 So, back at the main question, is there some keybindings for some actions that you ***very*** often do use? How did you manage to set it?

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m trying really hard to make elec-pair work for me without any success. This is a minimal config (Emacs 26.3):
 (electric-pair-mode t) (setq electric-pair--skip-whitespace nil) (setq electric-pair-skip-self nil) ;;it&#x27;s hard to indent in reddit (setq electric-pair-pairs &#x27;((?\( . ?\)) (?\[ . ?\]) (?{ . ?}) (?* . ?*) (?&#x60; . ?&#x60;) (?$ . ?$))) (setq electric-pair-text-pairs &#x27;((?\( . ?\)) (?\[ . ?\]) (?{ . ?}) (?* . ?*) (?&#x60; . ?&#x60;) (?$ . ?$))) 
 Basically the paired character are the brackets, the dollar sign, the backtick and the asterisk. The intended behaviour is that none of these should &quot;skip&quot;. (Meaning that typing } near another } should result in }}). 
 The brackes do not skip, but the other chars do skip! For example, if the point is at $|$ and i type another $ what i get is $$|. The dollar sign gets skipped! 
 Also, something i notices is that the double quote char (&quot;) gets paired even if it is not in my config file. Why is that? How should I configure electric-pair?

                              <span>Does anyone experience flickers in mingw builds when scrolling or resizing the frame?
 I&#x27;ve tried looking up issues from the past and it seems that it has something to do with double-buffering, but I haven&#x27;t found any solution that actually works.
 I have also tried snippets of the following variation:
 (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(inhibit-double-buffering . t))
 but none of them works.
 Are there any Windows users that have managed to find a solution for this?
 To be specific, I&#x27;m using Full-AOT builds from https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-28, but I&#x27;ve experienced the same issue with official GNU builds in the past. The same issue does not occur in WSL.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a new emacs user and working on setting up my environment. I have magit setup and working. I want to add Forge but I&#x27;m running into a few issues. 
 When I try to just do a package install of forge I get the following output: 
 package-install-from-archive: https://melpa.org/packages/ghub-20220403.1248.tar: Not found and when i use M-x forge there is nothing found.
 I get the same issue if i try to do a package install on ghub itself. 
 However when I go to melpa.org and search ghub This link comes up: https://melpa.org/#/ghub and the download link is https://melpa.org/packages/ghub-20220424.947.tar 
 Cool it exists. What i&#x27;m not sure of how to do is make the emacs package installer reconcile this link difference so that i can run package-install on forge.

                              <span>I made a deep dive into Emacs, Orgmode, and Elisp in 2020 and migrated almost all of my writing, editing, and task-management tools to it. Spent a significant amount of time learning the ins and outs of it.
 At some point I was tempted by shiny tools like OmniFocus (a fantastic tool, no doubt), Nisus Writer, Roam Research, and some more.
 After some time I realized I have isolated islands of tools not inter-operating, and I have little to no control over these tools, at least not in a consistent way (JavaScript in Roam, Apple Script and JS in OmniFocus, etc).
 So again I came back to Emacs + Org two weeks ago, having left it for several months. Now, as if my mind has been digesting all the infos that I have accumulated the months before I left it, I suddenly feel like all pieces fall together, I am quickly hacking Emacs Lisp for my workflow automations, my fingers are flying over the keyboard (using Karabiner Elements and &quot;God Mode&quot; https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6) and I get sooo much more done in a way not possible by the other tools I used! Everything is connected to each other now: My writing, documenting, my task management, my text editing and every bit of a text tranformation. This is such a wonderful way to get things done.
 Thank you to all the maintainers of Emacs, Orgmode, and all the wonderful packages like ivy, counsel, org-ql, and many more!
 Also, I am very happy with this community, that has helped me get a better understanding of the ins and outs of Emacs and Elisp.

                              <span>Hi,
 On my old notebook I get this frequently (maybe a config issue), on my main machine (Emacs v26.3) I do have this behavior right now: After undoing a large deletion (during a bisect-task) GNU Emacs is consuming its one CPU core for 100%, not ending for an hour or so. I consider this an end-less loop.
 Emacs server is running as well.
 What are my options to debug what&#x27;s going on? Can I somehow connect to the running instance and activate a profiler? Is there anything else besides killing the task what I can do?
 Thanks!
 Update 2022-04-25T16.21 CET: C-g did not do anything.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m writing fiction using Org Mode, which is obviously incredibly useful. Each heading contains a specific scene, and in that way I always know what piece I&#x27;m writing and where if fits in the plot.
 One thing I used to do when I outlined on paper was to color my cards according to the subplot they represented, and I think that would be useful on Org as well.

                              <span>Hi,
 I do have an issue with git recognizing four of my Org-mode files as binary.
 This has an impact on my workflow to detect unwanted changes which caused an issue in the recent days I did not recognize.
 In order to revert the unwanted changes, I do have to find my workflow for that. But first, I want to make sure that those Org-mode files are (again) treated as non-binary by git.
 Has anybody an idea on the things going on here that led to binary detection? How can I locate the characters that might lead to that wrong conclusion?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking a function which automatically aligns the code with then begin_src and end_src line, eg
 If I have something this.
  #+begin_src sh echo &quot;hello world&quot; #+end_src 
 The command should turn it into this:
 #+begin_src sh echo &quot;hello world&quot; #+end_src 
 or even indent it further inwards.
 #+begin_src sh echo &quot;hello world&quot; #+end_src 
 I have noticed that in newer versions of org, the code gets indented automatically though I don&#x27;t know what keystrokes trigger it or what commands do that.

 in LaTeX and for long files, I use C-c &#x3D; to open the table of contents and select the section I want to go to. I&#x27;m looking for a similar option in org files but somehow always end up on automatic TOC generation tools... Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you a lot!

                              <span>Ok, apologies for the title. 
 Don&#x27;t really know how to name what I&#x27;m looking for so here&#x27;s an attempt at describing what I&#x27;m trying to do.
  
I have a bunch of case classes with N amount of vals/ contractor params. Examples: Foo(a: String, b: String), Bar(c: BigDecimal, d: Set, e: Option). And so on..
 
I would like to have a &quot;rule&quot; or mechanism of some sort that would enforce compile time that for each companion object of these classes need to declare a corresponding val for each of it&#x27;s companion class constructor parameters. 
 
Let&#x27;s say I have a class ParamRules(rule1: String, rule2: String)
 
Naive idea in my head looks like that:
 
 case class Foo(a: String, b:String)
 object Foo extends MagicMechanism(Foo) ( val a_rules &#x3D; ParamRules(...) val b_rules &#x3D; ParamRules(...) )
 And with that compiler is satisfied.
 If the object Foo doesn&#x27;t implement a &quot;rule&quot; for one of there constructor params it fails compilation.
  
It doesn&#x27;t have to look like that it could be entirely different I just want to dynamically enforce this interface user to provide rule for each of the params in the class. 
  
Let me know if I&#x27;m day dreaming, over engineering or simply having a stroke and if you need any more explanation.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Note: the question comes below, I do apologize if this explanation isn&#x27;t clear. Let me know if you have any questions!
 I&#x27;ve been working on a series of functions for org-mode that make it easier to work with task items with sub-headings. I&#x27;ve called it org-taskwise and even though it&#x27;s still fairly lightweight, I&#x27;m getting a good amount of use out of it so far.
 Of course, these functions are not generally applicable to every org file I may write, though on the files that I want to use these functions, I want to overwrite some org-mode functionality with the functionality in this package. There is also functionality that does not need to overwrite org-mode functionality, but that complements it.
 E.g., the function org-taskwise-narrow-to-task complements other narrowing functions, like or…</span>

I snip it but I have yet to find an elegant solution to quickly save the system clipboards content as a file (automatic file naming) and insert it in Emacs at point as a reference in markdown syntax.
 Is there any Windows solution available?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m using doom-emacs and am trying to get syntax highlighting for the most part (I can manage without auto complete) on string literals that stores css / gql, for example this piece of code.
 const Wrapper &#x3D; styled.div&#x60; width: 24px; height: 24px; margin-right: 14px; cursor: pointer; &#x60; 
 ​
 export const schema &#x3D; gql.gql&#x60; type Transaction implements Entity { createdAt: Date createdBy: User entityType: EntityType! fileIds: [ID!]! }&#x60; 
 ​
 Now I saw some people are using polymode and mmm, I was not able to make it to work properly, I could make it highlight the code but it was not possible to write anything inside the string itself.
 When I think about this, it&#x27;s already happening with other languages like org-mode that can show syntax highlighting inside it&#x27;s code blocks and even on js/ts files when you&#x27;re doing the following:
 &#x60;this is a template string with a variable ${a &#x3D;&#x3D; b ? &#x27;this gets syntax highlighting&#x27; : &#x27;so why styled cant??&#x27;}&#x60; 
 Any help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>I think that if I can use Elisp outside of emacs for like... scripting or automation, it would be worth it. Because I do not have the capacity to learn elisp just so I can hack emacs (as much as I would love too... :[ )
 I often use NodeJS to write scripts for my business. If I can replace that with elisp that would be cool.
 What else can I do with elisp besides hacking emacs?
 (I am aware that elisp &#x3D; emacs lisp. The answer might be in the name? lol)

                              <span>Hiya, this is just a post announcing a packge I recently released to MELPA called [flymake-collection](https://github.com/mohkale/flymake-collection). It&#x27;s essentially a collection of checkers for flymake bringing it a little closer to the outstanding out-of-the-box experience offered by flycheck. It was renamed from a package called flymake-rest which you might&#x27;ve heard of. Please check it out if you&#x27;re interested and share any feedback :-).

 Now, when I run from TTY , that META key got changed to the ESCAPE key, which means instead of pressing the META key I have to press the ESCAPE key.
 Wondering ......https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MetaKeyProblems 
 But.....
 The question is :
 Can I have keys behaves similarly in both environments??

 As for push:
  (setq l &#x27;(a b)) ⇒ (a b) (push &#x27;c l) ⇒ (c a b) 
 As for add-to-list 
  (setq foo &#x27;(a b)) ⇒ (a b) (add-to-list &#x27;foo &#x27;c) ;; Add c. ⇒ (c a b) 
 The docs explain why quote &#x27;foo as:
  
The argument symbol is not implicitly quoted; &#x3D;add-to-list&#x3D; is an ordinary function, like &#x3D;set&#x3D; and unlike &#x3D;setq&#x3D;. Quote the argument yourself if that is what you want.
  
However, the question remains, why push not quote List?
 What&#x27;s the ideas behind to create the difference?

                              <span>Hi redditors, 
 has anybody accomplished customizing the background color of the tab-bar on Emacs 29.0.50? I tried to achieve this both via theme customization and gtk.css, but did not succeed. Can anybody help? (BTW: I am using the modus-themes)
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve just managed to setup LSP-Mode on emacs. I&#x27;m using Clangd and upon opening a C++ based program I&#x27;ve been working on and entering &quot;lsp-find-references&quot; I saw that it wasn&#x27;t finding all references. I believe this is because LSP-Mode didn&#x27;t find a project file when I opened the C++ file and I pointed it to the root folder of the project, but of course it didn&#x27;t find a project file because I don&#x27;t have one (why would I need something so useless when I&#x27;ve got a make file :) .) Anyway I tried adding a compile_commands.json file that I generated using this web sight: https://texttoolkit.com/compilation-database-generator and changing the lines with &quot;/path/to/your/project/&quot; to point to my project.
 However it doesn&#x27;t seem to have worked.
 How can I get LSP-Mode to recognize all the files in my C++ project?

 What if I have a Python code block with multiple variables inside (var2, var3 etc) that I would like to export and make them available across the rest of the document. How can I do that? Or at least to use the var2, var3 etc variables in other Python code blocks?

 At the moment I am using Projectile to switch projects. It kinda works because the buffer list is project specific. 
 Are there other options?

This messes up imenu, and in particular the lovely vertico grouping of consult-imenu. I don&#x27;t use CEDET. Any ideas what could be loading this so long after init?

 I feel rather silly asking this, but after rummaging through GitHub for a spell, I didn&#x27;t find anything.

                              <span>I have been using org-noter to read epubs in org-mode, which works fine until recently. When it is a pdf file, everything still works as before. However, when it comes to an epub file, org-noter will not work. I&#x27;m not sure why this happened but didn&#x27;t want to bother to dig into this issue because it is not the first time this package breaks down on me. Consequently, I need to think of a different way to read epubs and take notes in org-mode. Since I already use calibre to manage my ebooks, my new workflow simply combines using calibre links and xdg-open.
 The native ebook viewer in calibre allows us to export links to specific locations in the book. The link looks like &quot;calibre://view-book/someid/somefomat?open_at&#x3D;somelocation&quot;. Using xdg-open with this link opens the specified book at the exact location. The default viewer enables highlights and other annotation methods, which is also a plus. So all I need to do is to add a new link parameter for &quot;calibre&quot; in org mode and define a follow method. Below is a snippet.
  
(org-link-set-parameters 
 &quot;calibre&quot; 
 :follow &#x27;my/calibre-follow 
 ) 
 (defun my/calibre-follow (path) 
 (call-process &quot;xdg-open&quot; nil 0 nil (concat &quot;calibre:&quot; path)))
  
It is a very simple implementation but it does the job. If you have a similar workflow of reading ebooks and taking notes, maybe this can help. Feel free to add anything. I welcome any suggestions.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m currently a Scala data engineer located in East Asia, using Spark as ETL tool in my daily work.
 For some reasons, I want to immigrate to European or North American countries and settle down. 
 I&#x27;d like to ask, what is the minimum requirements for a Scala Data engineer to pass interview for companies like FAANG?
 Should I start practicing Leetcode now? Is it possible that the algorithm questions in the interview would be easier for data engineers? How far do a data engineer have to brush up his/her Leetcode level to find a job overseas. 
 I&#x27;m asking these questions, because in my native country, Spark ETL engineers seldom write algorithm code in an interview while they are still able to have the same salary level with other kind of engineers such as backend engineers.

Final writing assignment in JAMM328 Science Writing - an Op-ed. Processing
Registration for next term opens Friday at 3 PM for me. Stalled - I have to get a special dispensation for the class I want.
Prepping for the first backpacking trip of the year. Postponed due to schedule and weather.
This Week
Op-ed writing
I&#x27;ve finished the 2nd round with Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson. Now, on to atomizing and connecting.

                              <span>Hello,
 Recently my Emacs got automatically updated from 27.1 to 28.1 (thanks Snap!) and oh boy am I regretting this.
 First, I had to re-install use-package because none of the packages seemed to work. Then I had to update all of the packages. Then Emacs almost took my system down with CPU usage because it was apparently recompiling packages without letting me know in either the messages or warnings buffers. Together with a bunch of stuff in between made this a fun adventure.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m lucky that people over at the Emacs Matrix room were able to help out, otherwise I&#x27;d be very much dead in the water. Especially considering my newness to Emacs.
 However, as the title says, there&#x27;s still one issue remaining that irks me to no end. Emacs has lost the ability to collapse/expand headers of org-mode files. It could be a conflict between evil-mode and org-mode, but how do I tackle this? I have no idea.
 When I did C-h k  under an org file heading, I got this description:
 TAB (translated from ) runs the command evil-jump-forward (found in evil-motion-state-map), which is an interactive native compiled Lisp function in ‘evil-commands.el’. It is bound to TAB. (evil-jump-forward &amp;optional COUNT) Go to newer position in jump list. To go the other way, press C-o. 
 I don&#x27;t consider having a huge or complicated config, so I&#x27;m not sure why the breakage happened like it did. If you have suggestions for future-proofing my config so that above disasters don&#x27;t happen (or at least the chance of them get minimized), then please do let me know. Here&#x27;s my init.el
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit:
 Thanks to @yantar92:matrix.org I think I know the root cause: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1604 - Seems like Evil-mode is not yet fully adapted to work with Org-mode in Emacs v28. Workaround is noted in that issue though.

                              <span>Debian 11 user, using the default available emacs version: Package: emacs (1:27.1+1-3.1)
 Since I know debian tends to be behind as far as versions go I tried to follow the documentation here and use the elpa packages available through apt.
 Starting with elpa-evil (since I am new to emacs and want the vim bindings) I looked in list-packages after installing it via apt.
 Rather than a built-in package evil was listed as an external package.
 I may simply have worded my search wrong, but I couldn&#x27;t find a way to install since the install package command could not find evil, and list-package info said it was unsigned with no option to install.
 I wanted to know if I am misunderstanding something stupidly obvious since I am new, or if I should just attempt to use the git version and risk it not being compatible.

                              <span>Hi :) 
 I am focusing quite heavily on Node JS + svelte. I guess you could say I am a novice programmer. I generally build stuff for my self and my company. 
 I moved from Vim + Tmux to emacs today. I was not an advanced vim user (only 2 months.). But I moved because I wanted one environments that I could customize. 
 My question is this: do you believe learning elisp is vital to using emacs long term?

                              <span>So.. I recently started SQL stuff at uni, to be specific, postgresql.
 And so, I am not too sure what is the proper workflow, or what libraries are best 
 Right now I just like... Have buffer with file, buffer with psql, write query in psql, and if it works, copy paste into the buffer. 
 But I feel that is quite... inefficient in a way.
 So I am curious how it should be done #_#?

                              <span>I’ve been reading and searching, but am not sure how to do this. As with most things Emacs, there are tons of options.
 I would like to use the homerow keys hjkl (QWERTY) to navigate with my Dvorak layout keyboard, which would be htns. (My keyboard is programmed for Dvorak.). 
 I’m using Emacs from Scratch configuration, which uses evil mode. I see the two lines following, so perhaps I could just change them to “t” and “n”, but what about h and s?
 ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers (evil-global-set-key &#x27;motion &quot;j&quot; &#x27;evil-next-visual-line) (evil-global-set-key &#x27;motion &quot;k&quot; &#x27;evil-previous-visual-line) 
 I assume everything would be different if I decide not to use evil mode? Maybe using something like and adaptation of: 
  (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;) &#x27;backward-kill-word) 
 Finally, replacing C-x (quite a reach on the Dvorak layout) with C-u (right under the left index finger) makes so much sense. Would this work? 
 ;; swap C-x and C-u (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-x] [?\C-u]) (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-u] [?\C-x]) 
 And does it work with daemon mode now? (Via launchd?) 
 macOS 12, Emacs 28.1 
 Thanks 🙏

                              <span>I&#x27;ve run into this issue in a few recent elisp experiments. I want to use format strings with custom expandos to represent points of key-value data (that is, I want to print a formatted string from a object which has keys and values, like a bibtex entry).
 Normally I could do this with format-spec, and associate certain keys in the original object with certain expando letters. But often the data I am formatting either has many fields (more than 26, so a format-spec gets unwieldy), or has a few core fields common to all data points, but could have any arbitrary fields beyond those (so it is impossible to assign expandos to all field names). Biblatex entries for example have a reference key, 133 defined field names, and facility for users to define and use whichever fields they want! Even expandos for a-z, A-Z and 0-9 wouldn&#x27;t cover all that.
 On the assumption that the field names are always unique within a single object, a good solution to this might be somthing like format &quot;%(field-name-1) -- [%(field-name-2):%(field-name-3)]&quot;, so as to print something like foo -- [a:b]. The idea is that the expando names (field-name-1, field-name-2, etc.) are programmatically checked against the entry (or against a list generated programatically from the entry), so there is no need for an explicit list of expandos like format-spec uses. I think I have seen a few packages do things like this before, but can&#x27;t remember exactly where.
 Is there a standard way to do this?
 TIA!

 A bit like you can use agenda and org mode personally but in a way that any tasks are available to all users, got a small team of dev&#x27;s who all use emacs so be nice if we could integrate into our workflow if possible with out managing separate task lists?
 Or any other options with nice emacs integration both jira and trello never worked that well when we tried in the past.

 I recently switched to writing in Org Mode. I want to be able to open just one header to focus my writing in that area, instead of opening multiple with Shift+Tab. 
 I read online that TAB opens on headline but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. Any thoughts?

                              <span>In EXWM, one can enable a system tray by requiring exwm-systemtray and issuing exwm-systemtray-enable. This, however, by default puts the tray icons into the echo area, of all places. Since all my other system information is in the mode line, I would much prefer them to go there.
 Does anyone know of a way to do this? The exwm documentation is very quiet on this front.
 Alternatively, is there another community where I could find exwm wizards to help me out?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I just had a look at the exwm source code, and it turns out the system tray is actually a window that just happens to be pinned to the lower right of the screen. That probably rules out any simple way of achieving this.

                              <span>It&#x27;s amazing to run everything with Linux within Emacs 28.1 of native wins version, but just need two lines of codes:
 (setq shell-file-name &quot;C:/Windows/system32/bash.exe&quot;) (setenv &quot;ESHELL&quot; &quot;bash&quot;) 
  
Then you could get a bash shell of wsl-linux after M-x shell:

 Invoke shell-command(M-!) in bash environment rather than cmd.exe:

 Yeah, cmd.exe environment gone. you can comfortable run &quot;git add .; git commit -m &#x27;comment&#x27;; git push&quot; now in bash environment.

Also surprising to find the any &#x27;commands&#x27; bind to ones of wsl-linux, grep-find, counsel-rg …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a strange problem where minibuffer text is getting intermittently cut in half horizontally. So for a single-line message of the letter &quot;a&quot;, only the bottom half of that letter will appear, like the line height is too large for the minibuffer.
 Any ideas on what could cause this? It&#x27;s for all messages, not some specific package, and starts and stops randomly.

                              <span>I’m trying EMMS with mpd as a backend and it’s pretty great so far. However, not being able to sort by albumartist is a deal breaker for me.
 I’ve found a 7 year old “answer” that instead uses the directory names which is both unrobust and does not actually use the tag metadata.
 I also read a comment from several years ago in which the poster described setting the default browser view sorting method to albums. This suggested to me that I might be able to use &#x27;info-albumartist (instead of &#x27;info-album) from the EMMS manual but using the former resulted in Invalid function: &quot;Can’t sort unknown mapping!&quot;.
 It surprises me that no one appears to have solved this by now! Have I missed something? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>I would like to remove that bar locally to specific buffers (i want essentially just text with syntax highlighting), but I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called: the bar where evaluating (+ 1 2) would print 3 or show Auto-saving... done, from time to time.

                              <span>Context:
  
I just got an Apple M1 Pro machine and am at the start of the evaluation period
 Since I know I’ll be programming in Haskell, I’m trying to use the language as I normally would on another machine
 Today I’ve observed some unexpected behaviour that is frustrating and which I’ve never noticed before
 As a caveat, I also have another MacBook Pro (with just the M1 chip) for work usage; I have installed Haskell on it too, but have never encountered a similar issue
  
Problem:
  
Please refer to the screenshot for the example
 In said example, I want to take a multi-digit integer and make a list containing each of its digits
 I make a ‘mistake’ in applying digitToInt
 After the error, I make the necessary correction by hitting the up arrow key, then moving the cursor to the start of the line so I can add map
 I type 4 characters: m, a, p and space – if you look closely you will see that the characters are indeed appearing, but digitToInt $ show 56 is getting replicated, and everything ends up being concatenated together
 When I press return, though, GHCi runs the command and I get the expected result
 In the last line, I press the up arrow key twice, and what’s being shown are the two previous commands concatenated together
  
Questions:
  
How can I eliminate this behaviour?
 What else could I try to better understand its cause (so that I can fix it)?

 System and machine information:
  
macOS 12.3.1
 M1 Pro 14-inch
 Using the ABC Extended keyboard (although the same behaviour was observed when I selected just the US keyboard)
 Restarting the machine has not helped; I’ve not noticed similar issues when using the regular command line

                              <span>There was a period when Haskell was the most popular language to keep an eye on. From the end of the 2000s to the early 2010s, Haskell was the language that everyone wanted to code in. 
 But not many could, except perhaps only a handful of people. There were some really amazing projects done in Haskell. 
 There were massive financial tasks executed. There were payroll-related projects written in. 
 The most notable in the context of a pure functional language such as Haskell was Pandoc that had the Haskell basis. 
 Why did it happen? What caused it?

                              <span>So I have following Problem with VS-Code and the &quot;Haskell - language environment&quot;:
 I use cabal as building tool. On my project I have included a github repo as &quot;build-depends&quot; (with its respective cabal.project file...). When I import a module from the repo it says:
  
&quot;Could not load module ... It is a member of the hidden package ... Perhaps you need to add ... to the build-depends in your .cabal file.&quot;
  
Although I added the package to the cabal file. Furthermore &quot;cabal build&quot; will work without any problems... So my feeling is that this is a problem with VS-Code and its respective error highlighting... -&gt; what am I missing?
 cabal.project:

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s feasible to move of libreoffice writer onto orgmode. Can the following be achieved, in a streamlined way (more or less):
  
modifying the font, color of header levels;
 having an always visible table of contents shown right;
 could there be something like &quot;rendered view&quot; if I only want to read the prettily displayed text and &quot;working view&quot; when I want to change or define meta things, i.e. :PROPERTIES, #+SEQ_TODO:, etc.
 applying different font color to some table columns and not having elisp logic shown below. Ideally such logic could be defined in emacs.el;
  
​
 Out of all these 2 and 3 are the most important, as my notes can be lengthy and I use ToC to quickly navigate. Having them as headers at the top isn&#x27;t optimal as I&#x27;d always have to return to search again.As for #3, I&#x27;m having quite a few tables in my notes. At times, some columns are green, some are red. It&#x27;s important as it helps differentiate.
 ​
 Can it be done? I&#x27;m looking for such orgmode examples, but can&#x27;t quite find anything that fits the bill.

                              <span>I have noticed an odd behaviour since updating to 28.1 - new captures are marked with a dot to the left (in the fringe). These dots disappear if I restart Emacs, but I&#x27;d rather not have these dots here. 
 Can anybody let me know what these are/how to disable?
 Thanks!

 I tried it a while ago and didnt like that it relied on a db and numbers for links. 
 I know there is tags but they are not the same.
 Basically I would like it to behave lie obsidian or logseq but without having multiple files.

                              <span>Hello!
I was reading through Effective Notetaking by Dr. Fiona McPherson today and had one of those moments where a note fell out that immediately connected to some other notes from other places, which ultimately snowballed into me writing a blog post based on the idea.
I&#x27;ve not shared much in this community before because I felt like I haven&#x27;t had too much to say - but I&#x27;ve done plenty of reading along with everyone. As this post was both related to things I&#x27;ve been thinking about recently and directly related to the subject of the forum, I thought I might share it - and see if I can get any feedback!
Cheers</span>

Just kidding. We will just have a nice talk about this topic.

                              <span>Starting to get back into Scala and Spark after taking a break.
 Last time I used Scala I was lost and made very inefficient code, now I’m learning more about the fundamentals and such.
 My questions are:
 1.how do I know I’m using Scala as efficiently as possible? I am reading “programming in Scala” and some trending Apache spark books. Last time I wrote Scala like I would write Java and it was super slow. 
  
Is currying really used in team projects and should I dig deeper into it? 
 
Where can I learn more spark to tackle very advanced problems? I was thrown into the deep waters last time with spark and I was very overwhelmed because I didn’t know how to effectively use spark (still don’t) and all the tutorials were very basic and didn’t go into more advanced depth that I could use.
 
What are some quick ways to know when a problem can and can’t be tackled in parallel? Can any problem be tackled in functional programming?

                              <span>This question might sound provocative but it isn&#x27;t my intention. I&#x27;m genuinely curious why emacs has the concepts of &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; modes. 
 I&#x27;m no elisp guru but to me it seems that a minor mode can do everything a major mode can: they both have hooks, key bindings, custom variables, etc. The only real difference AFAIK is that major modes are mutually exclusive. And even the latter wouldn&#x27;t be hard to implement for minor modes by adding something like a boolean variable is-mutually-exclusive or a parameter. Yet the separation increases code complexity by separating the two and adding little idiosyncrasies to each.
 Moreover, the distinction introduces undue cognitive overhead by having us think of a mode as being the &quot;main&quot; or &quot;most important&quot; one in any given context. Why is that? Why e.g. should I think of js-mode as being somehow more &quot;major&quot; than lsp-mode even though the latter is the main driver of my editing process? It feels like maybe major and minor modes were abstractions designed to guide the process of creating packages but nowadays I see that as doing more harm than good.
 So, why not treat them on an equal footing? Do away with major and minor, and just have modes. To me it would decrease code complexity and reduce the cognitive overhead. But I&#x27;m not the expert here so I&#x27;m really curious about what you think about all this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m slowly learning elisp, and, as part of some org file processing that I want to do, I need to replace the content part of org-mode links (which are of the form: [[path][content]]) in a buffer. After looking around for a function that does that I couldn&#x27;t find it, so I thought a good training might be to try to write it from sratch. I came up with:
 (defun inwit/replace-org-link-description (link new-description) (setq content-start-point (org-element-property :contents-begin link)) (setq content-end-point (org-element-property :contents-end link)) (setq len-thing-to-remove (- content-end-point content-start-point)) (setq len-thing-to-add (length new-description)) (setq offset-delta (- len-thing-to-add len-thing-to-remove)) (delete-region content-start-point content-end-point) (goto-char (+ content-start-point offset-delta)) (insert new-description) ) 
 However, this doesn&#x27;t quite work, especially if it is run sequentially over several links in a buffer, because the substitutions (both the deletions and the insertions) start missing the correct spots after the first replacement, which works fine. What is happening here? I know that delete-region leaves the point where it should, and I thought that also insert does place the point after the insertion. However, I don&#x27;t see how sequential calls to this function in a map loop can miss the right spots after the first one. It&#x27;s like the numbering of the positions in the buffer does not update with my substitutions.
 In other words, is there a way to update the buffer so the following calls to my function can refer to the actual positions of the already modified buffer? Or, am I missing the point and there is a much better way to approach this task?

                              <span>Unfortunately there are major incompatible changes in Emacs 28 that break many packages. Rather than try to update these packages, if they&#x27;ve even been fixed, I&#x27;ve just removed them since I haven&#x27;t used most of them in a long time anyway. (I only use Emacs to run Elfeed anymore.) Notably use-package 2.4 is incompatible with Emacs 28, so I had to upgrade to 2.4.1. Evil currently has no releases compatible with Emacs 28, so I just picked the latest commit. Not ideal, but I will hardly use it anyway.

 I want to be able to move up &amp; down in the buffer and browse through the items (without having to press RET every time).
 I&#x27;ve found embark-collect-direct-action-minor-mode, but can&#x27;t figure out what it does. The docstring is somewhat ambiguous, and turning the mode on doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.

What are your thoughts about use-package or eval-after-load? Now I’m using the latter, but it feels it’s a little messy, with ‘require’ here and there and not much lazy loaded.

                              <span>I use Dracula theme on all my apps. I just started using emacs and I installed the dracula theme.
 For some reason, the text highlighting is a blinding yellow and I cannot seem to change it
 I tried &#x60;(set-face-attribute &#x27;region nil :background &quot;#666&quot; :foreground &quot;#ffffff&quot;)&#x60;
 but it didnt seem to work either

                              <span>Overview
 This is a new issue for me that started about a week ago.
 I started having issues with some git commands in when using magit and vterm recently. Specifically, git couldn&#x27;t read my global config file. However, if I ran git from a non-Emacs terminal everything worked properly.
 I did a little research and learned that Emacs sets the following two environment vars:
 shell GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL&#x3D;/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM&#x3D;1 
 These settings make git ignore my global config. Hooray for a problem half solved! Now I need to figure out how to un-set these variables in an Magit-friendly way.
 What I&#x27;ve Tried
  
After unsetting these variable in a shell session in vterm I can use the git command again but magit is still broken. 
 I also tried unsetting those environment vars in the script that I run to launch Doom but that didn&#x27;t work.
 Finally, I also read in the FAQ that I should try exec-path-from-shell, which I am already using. I tried executing the exec-path-from-shell-initialize function interactively but that did not seem to help.
  
Does anyone know how to configure magit to unset these variables?

                              <span>Hi Emacs friends,
 If you worked at an enterprise and the security team asked you &quot;why cant you just use visual studio like everyone else?&quot; how would you reply? 
 For instance, my response might be &quot;emacs is a more efficient text editor for language XYZ that I&#x27;ve been using for a long time&quot; and their response might be &quot;Fred in accounting programs in XYZ and they use ....&quot;. 
 I&#x27;m purposely leaving out a few details, but basically any logical explanation I have they have a response for. 
 Curious what you think, and thanks in advance.

 BOOM!!! Let&#x27;s get to the point!!!
 What&#x27;s magic when programming Elisp code is that at any time:
  
we can extract a little part of the program,
 replace some symbols by custom values,
 send it to the minibuffer with M-x eval-expression (or pp-eval-expression), press RET and,
 automatically get back some value in the echo area (or in the dedicated buffer *Pp Eval Output*).
  
In almost no time, misconceptions about what a program does (or why a program fails) can be spot that way.

                              <span>Hello /r/emacs,
 I&#x27;ve been an emacs users for a few years now. I know basic elisp, which means I wrote my own config and I can read and modify elisp snippets. I never created a package though.
 As the title suggest I&#x27;d like to write my own major-mode for a programming language, but I don&#x27;t know anything about this topic, and I don&#x27;t know where to start either.
 ​
 Can you recommend any resources or guides on writing a language mode from 0? Additionally maybe some simple (few lines of code) but quality codebases for language modes and examples worth studying?

                              <span>Hi.
 What&#x27;s your preferred way of installing Emacs on Ubuntu? The distro still ships with 27.1 and I can&#x27;t seem to find an up-to-date PPA with the latest stable releases.
 There&#x27;s the Emacs snapshot PPA but I&#x27;m not really interested in it. I much prefer stability.
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks in advance.

 Regularly opening and later switching to fundamental mode has the downside that it might take much longer or actually killing emacs.
 So I am looking for the sweet spot: Open the next file literally but do EOL and encoding detection.
 How can I do this?

                              <span>I recently upgraded packages and now when I try to open an epub file within emacs using nov.el I get &quot;Wrong type argument: arrayp, nil.&quot; Could anyone help me with this? If I revert to my emacs.d backup before upgrading it works fine.
 Thanks for any suggestions.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve got a haskell cw in which we are allowed to use external libraries. My professor will only use ghc to compile a main.hs file.
 I want to use a library called RDF4H and I am wondering if there is a way to make this library portable and already preinstalled for my professor.
 On my PC I use cabal install --lib rdf4h to use this library and then import it as Data.RDF, but my professor will not be using any cabal commands.

                              <span>Hi all,
 After trying a few effect systems (starting with monad transformers), it seems that most people consider the ReaderT eff IO pattern the most pragmatic way to handle extensible effects. This includes UnliftIO, which is considered &quot;the good way&quot; to do MonadBaseControl stuff, and some libraries even require UnliftIO instead of MonadBaseControl for unlifting IO.
 However, it seems that UnliftIO has zero support for Either-based error handling and ReaderT eff IO just assumes that you are using exceptions. Particularly after writing quite some Rust, I think that Either/Result is just a superior way to do error handling (specially with syntactic support or some abstractions to convert and generate error types). Unchecked exceptions in my opinion are bad, and feel like I&#x27;m back in Python-land where your program can crash at any time from anywhere without any guidance from type signatures.
 Are we supposed to forget about Either and typing and just embrace exceptions, or is there any hope in this regard? Can UnliftIO support this in any way? (I consider wrapping-throwing-catching-unwrapping Lefts more of a workaround)

                              <span>Hi!
 Some time ago I wrote a script to provide tab-completion for CLI programs in haskell built upon optparse-applicative. Arguably, one of the most used such programs is stack, so here is a link to the gist of such script for stack: Gist
 Simply fill in the desired executable and a full path to that executable, save, and dot-source the script. (. _stack.ps1 for the gist above).
 Admittedly, there might be some corner cases where the completion does not have exactly same behavior in pwsh and in bash/fish/zsh due to architectural differences in completion engines; if you find them - let me know, we will find a workaround &#x3D;)
 Tab-completion would work best in pwsh &gt;&#x3D; 6. PR to optparse-applicative to autogenerate this script exists.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made a small library with implementations of two truth maintenance systems (TMSs) available on Hackage and Github. They are translations of Forbus and de Kleer&#x27;s justification-based and assumption-based (JTMS and ATMS) algorithms.
 TMS algorithms are classic AI approaches to reasoning about logical implication relationships. Code using a TMS defines nodes representing sentences or logical ideas, and how some nodes can be used to conclude other nodes. We can also identify &quot;nogood&quot; or contradictory sets of nodes. Some nodes are distinguished as assumptions, and the TMS lets us reason about how the belief or disbelief in each assumption impacts whether we should also believe or disbelieve other nodes.
  
In the JTMS, the believe/disbelieve setting for each assumption is set directly, and the JTMS maintains the believe/disbelieve status of each node based on the current assumption beliefs.
 In the ATMS, there is no setting of &quot;current&quot; beliefs. Instead, the ATMS tracks the minimal consistent sets of assumptions which justify belief in each node.
  
Please do not look for beautiful and pure functional algorithms here! At this point the implementations are direct translations of the original imperative Common Lisp implementations, implemented as a monad transformer, and using STT. A non-stateful re-implementation remains an interesting idea for the (non-short-term) future! I wrote this library to give myself a bit more insight into how these algorithms work on the inside, and some deeper practice with the state thread libraries than I&#x27;d had before, but I hope you find them interesting or useful.

the essential scala course, 
 the advance scala course

I am still in the essential course, for months now due to not really having the patience of watching the courses ( which seems to be too dragged out for me).
 Previous to purchasing the course I had gone through the official docs and gone through the tour of the language which is like an overview.
 In your opinion wouldn&#x27;t it be best to just get my hands dirty on a basic project after going through a quick start guide on Akka and checking the docs if I get stuck as opposed watching length time consuming videos?

This became more and more difficult as my new job assignments requires me to collaborate and share more and more of my daily routine work. If some of you come to the point to work together with an executive assistant who basically own your calendar, you might know what I am talking about. So I gave up on org for some time. However, recently I looked back into it and thinking giving it a shot again. Esp. since I noticed that the eco system for smartphones has become really nice and I could start to work on org-files &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. 
 So, this left me with the task to make it accessible to others in a non-nerd, non-text, minimum-learning-curve …</span>

                              <span>I feel like everyone saying org-mode is useful is lying... I can&#x27;t wrap my head around at how it would be any better than literally any other way of writing things down. Markdown syntax is simpler, and doesn&#x27;t cause stupid automatic indenting that makes no sense. Why so many keybindings to the arrow keys?!?!??! The point of Emacs is to not have to move your hands off the home row, everything accessible at the fingertips... Not go back and forth between arrow keys and home row. It feels like org mode doesn&#x27;t even fit Emacs, isn&#x27;t useful, and I can&#x27;t see how it does anything in a better way than TeX/LaTeX, Markdown, literal plain text, etc. Sorry about the rant, I just don&#x27;t understand how anybody uses this...

Even with fewer, it seems like using a single letter can force one to compromise due to similar letters.
 Is there a way to use two letters to select? Or maybe even better, an interactive auto-completion?
 Im talking about selecting

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been using emacs28 for some time now, which I build like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git &amp;&amp; cd emacs git checkout emacs-28 &amp;&amp; git pull
 ./autogen.sh ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-json \ --with-mailutils --with-imagemagick \ --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid \ CFLAGS&#x3D;&quot;-O3 -mtune&#x3D;native -march&#x3D;native -fomit-frame-pointer&quot; prefix&#x3D;/usr/local make -j16 sudo make install &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now that emacs-28 is out, has anybody been using master (emacs-29)? If so, is it stable enough for prime use or should I wait a little longer?

                              <span>I really like how default elisp tab completion works.
 if you set (setq tab-always-indent &#x27;complete), pressing tab in elisp buffer first correctly indents, and then if indented it &quot;tries to complete the thing at point&quot; basically autocompletes, by calling completion-at-point. i have eglot and clang installed, and i expect the same behavior in c++ buffer, but pressing tab, only calls c-indent-line-or-region. doing M-x completion-at-point or C-M-i works, but its far less convenient that just using tab key. I&#x27;m aware that there are other packages that do implement compilation for you, but i try to use built in stuff as much as possible.

 Beginner in emacs-lisp I address to you concerning the following project: https://github.com/DarkBuffalo/org-easy-blog.
 Is it possible to add an item to the &#x27;org-publish-project-alist&#x27; variable instead of redefining it with setq like in the following bad example? : https://github.com/DarkBuffalo/org-easy-blog/blob/4a30b86158d3554ab96de8afd3e8979ba31bcb9c/org-easy-blog.el#L293

                              <span>To find (via regexp) lines starting with one or more asterisks I&#x27;d come up with this pattern in Python:
 &quot;^\*+ &quot; 
 In Emacs I have to use double backslashes like so:
 &quot;^\\*+ &quot; 
 But it does not work in this line:
 (string-match &quot;^\\*+ &quot; &quot;** This is a heading&quot;) 
 What am I missing?
 Update
 Apparently it worked because it returns &quot;0&quot;, which is the index of the string beginning with the match.

Theres a lot of cruft in there and some of the packages dont even work currently anymore, because they are no longer actively developed, things like irony, rtags, and elpy. I can also remove a lot of packages from my setup because I no longer need them. I&#x27;ve used helm this whole time, but I think maybe its time to give ivy a try and also switch to lsp. 
 Anyone else just start fresh after using their setup for a long time?

Or recently that M-q seems to be unused in the global scope but in paredit mode it actually has a function.
 So, is there a system that you use for finding these new homes for functions that need them?

                              <span>Hi, one of the main challenges I have when writing elisp is that I can&#x27;t use edebug effectively.
 I write python during the daytime, and as flawed as Python (and its debugger) is, I have managed to create a comfortable workflow with dap-mode:
  
Set a debug point
 Run the debugger until it hits the breakpoint.
 dap-hydra shows a bunch of useful keybinds
 dap-ui-repl pops up, which lets me interactively try out expressions, inspect variables, and more.
  
Meanwhile, the current state of my elisp debugging is:
  
edebug-defun and (optionally) set breakpoint. However, the breakpoint is not visible in the buffer, so it&#x27;s easy to lose track of.
 Run the function until debugger stops the execution. At this point, a new keymap is introduced with binds I don&#x27;t know, that overwrite many of my regular keybinds. They can be inspected with ?, it&#x27;s just a bit... jarring to have half your keyboard change meaning.
 edebug-eval-expression can be used to open a minibuffer to evaluate expressions. It&#x27;s kind of nice, but it&#x27;s not a replacement for a proper window repl as it doesn&#x27;t show history. I often want to evaluate an expression, and look at the result as I&#x27;m evaluating the next expression.
  
Apparently ielm and running eval-defun is one way to get the workflow I want, but I&#x27;m having some issues there (probably related to my config). There is some discussion on it here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/36918/edebug-repl-ielm
 All of my issues can be solved, and I think ielm is the way to do it, but this just makes me wonder: How do experienced elisp programmers use edebug? It doesn&#x27;t seem standard to rely on ielm.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a total Haskell beginner, and am definitely in way over my head, but here goes anyways. Basically, I want to transform a function from one that uses currying to one that consumes part of an array and adds its output to the arrays head. I have a set of functions that I can use for that:
 base :: a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] base &#x3D; (:) one :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] one f (x:xs) &#x3D; base (f x) xs one _ x &#x3D; x two :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] two f (x:xs) &#x3D; one (f x) xs two _ x &#x3D; x --etc. 
 However, one and two are basically identical, and also look very recursive. It feels like there should be some way to write one function that would work for all length functions, but I have no idea how that would work.
 Any help would be appreciated!

 The use case is a monadic function that is applied to Maybe value (or any other Monad, really, but Maybe seems quite common) that also returns Maybe value, so I need to join two Maybes...
 f :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; m (Maybe b) f _ &#x3D; pure Nothing g :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; b -&gt; m (Maybe c) g _ &#x3D; pure Nothing h :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; m (Maybe c) h x &#x3D; fmap join . mapM g &#x3D; m (n b)?

 I was wondering what is the best way the search for a &quot;magic string&quot; that signals the beginning of some data. Seems like I need to go byte by byte, do a lookahead for the magic string, if it doesn&#x27;t match, then advance a byte and repeat.
 Is this the approach? Is there a more elegant way to do this?

However, when I save an image in my clipboard, I keep getting prompted to &quot;Please install the xclip program.&quot; I have installed xclip through use-package and I tried to install it via package-install command, but it did not show xclip there. How can I resolve this issue?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Is there a way to prevent org export to escape $ symbols when exporting to latex? For example in my simple orgfile I may write
 ​
 some fancy interesting things on function $f(x) &#x3D; x$. 
 which will get exports to 
 some interesting things on function \(f(x) &#x3D; x\) 
 which can be generated perfectly well to compile this to PDF, but is not so handy when giving somebody else this TeX file. I remember there was an option setting you could set, i.e. 
 #+options: tex:verbatim 
 but that does not produce what I want. If somebody could point me to the right the direction, I would be grateful :D!

                              <span>Dear all,
 I am continuing my experiment with Org mode meetups and online debugging.
 This time, I plan to 1. Talk about contributing patches to Org - Applying patches sent by others - Testing changes (make test) - Creating patches - Sending patches to the mailing list 2. Talk about and debug any issues related to Org interactively via screen sharing.
 Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.
 The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Kyiv; 2pm London; 9am New York). Sat, Apr 23
 I will post the link to the meeting one hour before the meeting start.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I attempted to write alternatives to manage dependencies in Scala apps.
 Agenda there is:
  
Dead patterns. 
 DI frameworks.
 Cake pattern.
 
 Pure ideas. 
 Dependency rejection.
 Dependencies as function parameters.
 The notion of the context for a function.
 
 Tooling and approaches. Reader and friends. 
 Reader monad.
 Dependency as API detail.
 Making unique contexts is not simple.
 ZIO ZLayer.
 Monad transformers (ToFu).

 I am open to any kind of feedback. Please let me know in case you&#x27;ll have any concerns.
 Thank you!

Create recursion schemes using comonads by Luc Tielen
In today’s post, I explain how comonads can be used to create a tailor-made recursion scheme to perform computations based on multiple simultaneous folds over a single recursive datatype.

                              <span>Tweag and Mercury are happy to announce a server-side library for the the WebAuthn specification (part of the FIDO2 project), available as webauthn on Hackage!
This library has been developed by a team at Tweag, contracted by Mercury. Mercury felt that Webauthn support was a missing element in the Haskell ecosystem, and wanted to contribute an open-source library to fill this gap.
The library builds upon two previous prototypes, in concertation with their authors: a hackathon project by Arian van Putten and an alternative implementation by Fumiaki Kinoshita (also known as webauthn-0 on Hackage).
In the rest of the blog post we will mostly focus on introducing WebAuthn itself.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have the following code to generate two keybindings:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (general-create-definer map-to-leader :keymaps &#x27;override :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; &quot;&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;leader-key&quot;))
 (map-to-leader :states &#x27;(normal visual motion) :keymaps &#x27;override &quot;d&quot; &#x27;(:wk &quot;dired&quot;)
 &quot;d d&quot; &#x27;((lambda () (interactive) (dired &quot;~/Documents&quot;)) :wk &quot;docs&quot;)
 &quot;d p&quot; &#x27;((lambda () (interactive) (dired &quot;~/Pictures&quot;)) :wk &quot;pics&quot;))  I would to declare a variable like:  (setq bms &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;~/Documents/&quot; &quot;docs&quot;) (&quot;p&quot; &quot;~/Pictures/&quot; &quot;pics&quot; )))  And then populate the &#x60;map-to-leader&#x60; call by iterating through &#x60;bms&#x60;. For instance:  (defun bms-entries-map-to-leader () (interactive) (let ((binding)) (dolist (bm bms binding) (setq binding (cons (,(concat &quot;d &quot; (nth 0 bm)) ,((lambda () (interactive) (dired ,(nth 1 bm))) :wk ,(nth 2 bm)))
  binding))))) 
 &#x60;&#x60; But I cannot use this function inmap-to-leader&#x60;. Any help or suggestions would be very welcome. Thank you!

Is there a way to execute the compiled binary in eshell and copy back the result in the Result block ? If you guys have a solution, please help
 edit so , i just started using this stupid bash script

 Is there any existing infrastructure to turn this into an R data frame that I just fail to find?
 Basically, I&#x27;d rather collect data in &quot;plain&quot; org mode (possibly across multiple files) than create formatted tables or dedicated code blocks.

 I&#x27;m trying to add an overlay in #emacs to show code that is not covered by tests.
 When I run my tests, there is a coverage.xml file generated.
 Now, how to use it?
 There is https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-python-coverage that does that, but stated as &quot;experimental&quot;.Does anybody used it? Any comment about it?
 Any other package than does that job well?

 Any option i set, like, for example: (setq org-startup-folded &quot;overview&quot;) does absolutely nothing.
 I can&#x27;t change the way Org modes are opened?

                              <span>I seem to have a problem that many others have faced before me. Unfortunately, none of the proposed solutions seem to work for me. I have the following font settings in my Emacs config:
 lisp (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font&quot; :height 140 :weight &#x27;normal :width &#x27;normal) (set-face-attribute &#x27;fixed-pitch nil :font &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font&quot; :height 140 :weight &#x27;light) (set-face-attribute &#x27;variable-pitch nil :font &quot;IBM Plex Sans&quot; :height 150 :weight &#x27;regular) (set-fontset-font t &#x27;unicode &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; nil &#x27;prepend) 
 On Linux, this has worked just fine but on macOS 12.3.1 some special characters are not displayed properly (e.g. #x2b57 (HEAVY CIRCLE WITH CIRCLE INSIDE) or #x2b59 (HEAVY CIRCLED SALTIRE)). The necessary fonts have all been installed and I am currently using the latest Emacs version on master which is 29.0.50. Any help with this is highly appreciated.

                              <span>The echo area takes up a bit of annoying space at the bottom and it would be better if most of the time it was not visible. 
 My proposal is to autohide it and when enabled to be displayed above the modeline, that way the modeline won&#x27;t be dancing around all day. 
 Has anybody done something similar or know if it is possible?

Error: (doom-hook-error before-save-hook format-all-buffer--from-hook (error &quot;Timeout while waiting for response. Method: textDocument/formatting&quot;))
  
Is Kubernetes too big for Emacs to work on? Does anyone have successful experience of using Emacs with projects as big as kubernetes? Could you please share with me your configuration?

 I recently switched to Emacs 28.1 hoping to use the new native-comp support. Being on Windows, I followed these instructions to install libgccjit, copying the resulting libgccjit.dll library to Emacs’s bin folder. However, upon doing so, I received the following warning whenever Emacs attempted to compile any file:
 Warning (comp): C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Temp\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is &#x60;&quot;&#x27; Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Temp\\libgccjit-554575/fake.s:4: Error: file number less than one Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): c:\emacs\bin\libgccjit-0.dll: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging Warning (comp): : Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging 
 (Where  is the name of each file Emacs attempted to compile, of course.)
 Curiously, when I launch Emacs from MSYS2 MinGW (64-bit), the errors disappear, and Emacs is successfully able to compile all files. What is going on here, and how may I fix it? All I know at this point is that the problem is probably unrelated to the dependencies to libgccjit.dll: using dumpbin libgccjit.dll /dependents revealed that Emacs’s bin folder already contains all dependencies of libgccjit.dll.

I managed to almost achieve my desired setup by following the instructions here, the only problem being that I have to enter the password twice when saving the file. The problem is that I fear that when accidentally entering the password incorrectly twice, I could lock myself out of my password file forever. Is there a way not to be prompted for the‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­password when saving, or alternatively for the save-password to be rejected when its hash doesn&#x27;t match the password that I opened the file with?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m reading the free sample of &quot;Book of Monads&quot; (https://leanpub.com/book-of-monads/) and I&#x27;m a bit confused with the very first example, which is &quot;relabel&quot; function implementation. Here, authors introduces
 type WithCounter a &#x3D; Int -&gt; (a, Int) 
 type and then states that the type of &quot;relabel&quot; functions becomes
 Tree a -&gt; WithCounter (Tree a) 
 But shouldn&#x27;t it be
 Tree a -&gt; WithCounter (Tree (Int, a)) 
 instead?
 Could anyone tell me, please, is it a mistake by author or am I missing something? I&#x27;m a Haskell newbie and the whole example breaks my mind really hard: it would never occur to me to rewrite the initial implementation of &quot;relabel&quot; like this.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m taking a class on Functional Programming and I&#x27;m trying to write a function that removes all the integers that occur in one list from another. I basically just want to delete the value once. What I mean by this is that if I give the list [1,2,3,3,3] and [2,3] I want the output [1,3,3] and not just [1]. I don&#x27;t know if it made any sense what I meant.
 This is what I have so far and it just doesn&#x27;t work:
 deleteItem :: [Int] -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
 deleteItem [] [] &#x3D; []
 deleteItem [] ys &#x3D; ys
 deleteItem xs [] &#x3D; []
 deleteItem [x] ys &#x3D; delete x ys
 deleteItem (x:xs) (y:ys) | x &#x3D;&#x3D; y &#x3D; deleteItem (x:xs) ys
 | otherwise &#x3D; y: deleteItem xs ys
 It doesn&#x27;t need to work recursively, but this was what I could come up with. I appreciate all the help I can get!
 Thank you for your time!

                              <span>TL; DR: Game made with apecs-gloss crashes when trying to read input from Nintendo Switch.
 This is a follow up to my previous post (trying to control a small game made with apecs-gloss with the switch joy cons). The game was crashing so I parallelised the joy cons’ part of the code. Unfortunately, although now the input is read and interpreted correctly (I print it on the screen), the game, at best, only responds to the first 1-2 inputs and then crashes. Any help will be appreciated! Apologies if I made any mistakes in the parallelisation, it’s only my first experiment in this field 😊
 Here are some snippets with what I did: (Full code here)
  
The joy cons’ inputs are stored in a global component with 3 TBQueues of 10 elements each (the Maybe is for the case of not connecting a controll…</span>

 I tried it without the init-file and it gives the same result. Maybe just my installation bugged out.

                              <span>Hi all,
Quick question re: atomicity of notes and maintaining the flexibility and mutability that comes with sticking to one idea per note — while also making the most of the many possible connections a note could have.
How do you think about adding in links to other notes (each of which requires some elaboration/explanation for why they&#x27;ve been linked to/mentioned in the current note) without making the note now be &quot;about&quot; more than one thing?
Do you see the additional text explaining the inclusion of a linked note as &#x27;not counting&#x27; towards the main concept of the note? Do you put the connections and links under a References header to separate in into different types of content?
The image below is an example of a note where I feel like I&#x27;ve managed to maintain the singular point of the note (what the concept of &quot;in process&quot; notes is in my system) fairly well but I can also see how paragraphs 2 and 3 could be seen as separate ideas to the main idea of the note. In that case, wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to have that text appear as bullets under the Reference header?
I know there&#x27;s no one way to use a zettelkasten but your thoughts on the way of thinking about atomicity when linking would be helpful.

                              <span>I have published 3 articles about ML model evaluation and optimal decisions on my personal blog. The code base that supports the examples/discussion is written in scala. 
 I wanted to experiment with scala and compare it to the scripting languages that I am more familiar with for this type of work (R, python, stata). Bottom line is that data science in scala is a bliss! I enjoyed mill to manage dependencies, ammonite to run investigative workflows, and smile to train/deploy statistical models. Also, writing data transforms, which is the bulk of most data science workflows, is so much easier in scala.
 I hope you will find the content interesting/useful, and I would welcome any type feedback. Even though I don&#x27;t plan to do further work on the code base, I would appreciate any comments on this as well. I consider myself beginner-intermediate in scala and I have reviewed my own PRs, so conscious there&#x27;s room for improvement :)

                              <span>I have a need to open a file for processing that sits in a zfs snapshot directory (/.zfs/snapshot/...).
 When trying to open a file under the snapshot directory, emacs fails with:
 File mode specification error: (error ‘tramp-file-name-structure’ didn’t match!) Recursive load: &quot;/usr/share/emacs/26.3/lisp/net/tramp.elc ... 
 I have a completely valid usecase for opening such files with emacs in batch mode. This error occurs in non batch modes as well; both GUI and cli (-nw).
 I know these .zfs folders are special folders which is why tramp may be in use. Any idea on how to get around this issue?
 This issue seems like a bug.

                              <span>Bit of a newb, getting back into Emacs and org-mode. I&#x27;m using daviwil&#x27;s emacs from scratch config (Emacs.org tangling to init.el). Problem I&#x27;m having is when I C-c C-t on a task, all of the options aren&#x27;t visible. That is, there should be three lines shown, but only a little over two lines are shown.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get rid of line truncation across my emacs config in favour of visual-line-mode, but I&#x27;m quite confused as to the org-startup-truncated variable. I have  (setq-default truncate-lines t) (setq truncate-lines t)  earlier in my config, which disables truncate lines globally.
 If org-startup-truncated is set to t (as it is by default), I can see that emacs truncates lines in org mode
 If it is set to nil, I also seem to get the same result. Reading the docs for org-startup-truncated, I expected this to make org mode respect the default.
 Does anyone know what might be causing this? 
 I also noticed that the message shown after I run M-x toggle-truncate-lines seems to be backwards (i.e. it says that truncation has been enabled when it stops wrapping)
 Edit: I apparently had a hook that was enabling visual-line-mode in org mode, which was toggling truncate lines. I&#x27;m slightly confused why truncate-lines is connected to visual-line-mode, so if someone could explain that would be great (though my issue itself is solved)

 My habits file is this: 
 * TODO Brush Teeth SCHEDULED:  :PROPERTIES: :STYLE: habit :END: 
 My init.el file has my habits enabled as below and the file added to org agenda as below
  (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/Projects/emacsone/OrgFiles/tasks.org&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;~/Projects/emacsone/OrgFiles/habits.org&quot;) (require &#x27;org-habit) (add-to-list &#x27;org-modules &#x27;org-habit) (setq org-habit-graph-column 60)) 
 I&#x27;ve also confirmed in the agenda that org-habit-toggle-habits is on. 
 When i click the schedule date of the item inside of my habits file it jumps to a Day -agenda view but doesn&#x27;t show the habit.
 Day-agenda (W16): Tuesday 19 April 2022 tasks: In 1 d.: TODO [#A] Merge the PR 
 Please let me know if you need any other information to aid in assisting me.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 i can not longer use mu4e with my outlook account because of 2FA. I used to set it up through a combo of DavMail and offlineimap3, but now that doesn&#x27;t work because DavMail can no longer create a bridge between outlook and imap, since I don&#x27; know how to get it working with 2FA.
 I was wondering if anyone has faced this problem before, or has any alternative suggestions. Were you too forced to give up on Emacs for mail?

And when I use clion with clangd these errors are just gone and the syntax check outputs are the same as compiler compilation output. 
 These are my operations when I get starting with a project: cmake -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMAND&#x3D;YES -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&#x3D;Debug &amp;&amp; ln -s build/compile_command.json .. 
 Are there any operations and configurations I missed?

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am teaching c++ programming and one of the parallel things I am trying to transmit is the importance of not only a clear logic but also of a readable code, which includes proper indentation. In spite of the many ways to indent code that are present in emacs, vscode , etc, or even using simple tools like clang-format , students still manage to create and present code which is just not organized, putting everything at the same 0 spaces level or similar. Since sometimes I give them a template to work on, I want to mess with it by removing proper indentation automatically, so I would like to know if there is a way to &quot;random indent&quot; a file in emacs, like adding four space to one line, then zero spaces to the next line, then two and so on, so they will be forced to organize it.
 Thanks

                              <span>I am currently investigating a way to configure how display-line-numbers-mode &quot;stands out&quot;. Either by intensifying line numbers or make them less outstanding. But I would like to contrast them in respect to main text.
 I use the deeper-blue theme, but haven&#x27;t otherwise changed any defaults settings of themes or faces.
 I would like to specify that the * background-color of line-number should be &quot;more intense than the current background&quot;; and/or * the foreground-color should be &quot;less intense than the current default foreground color&quot;.
 So changing it like it is possible with highlight-indent-guides where I can give a percentage of how the face should vary in respect to &#x27;normal&#x27;. Is this possible?

 Hey Emacsers,
 Have you ever needed to rename a function that appears in several files?
 Let&#x27;s see how we can do this with Emacs.
 In the post the fantastic rg.el, we&#x27;ve seen that rg.el is a nice Emacs interface to the cli ripgrep which lets us do searches for regexp in files interactively with rg command, get the results in a dedicated buffer *rg* (by default), browse those matches, modify the searches parameters and modify the matched regexps, all from within the dedicated buffer *rg*.
 In this post we see how to rename interactively a function that appears in several files usi…</span>

                              <span>Description of the problem :
As I work with my Zettelkasten, I see the fear of forgetting what I&#x27;ve construct inside grows and grows bigger as days pass.
I switched from explicite file names to ID names, so I am afraid of losing of sight the content of the notes. I think I will get back to explicite titles again.
I don&#x27;t trust process I don&#x27;t control. I need to feel I have control over the amount of knowledge I have in my Zettelkasten.
Solutions already implemanted :
General index of my whole notes with aliases and subject.
Subjects notes with inside logical organisation.
Zettel links to create connexion and meanings.
The big index : 


Baby hubs in building : 


I don&#x27;t use tags : they become quite messy, useless, they create clutters but I have to remember tags as well to make a useful utilisation of tags.
What I want to know
How do you remember ? How do you know what is the content of your Zettelkasten ?
Did I miss something ? An important point ?
What tools help you ?</span>

                              <span>When I export a source block to HTML I get a nicely syntax highlighted text. However, I&#x27;d like to add links inside this text.
 Here is an example:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (defun hello () &quot;Just a function.&quot; (message &quot;Hello&quot;)) #+end_src #+begin_src emacs-lisp ;; Now we are goin to call the function hello (hello) #+end_src 
 I want this to export to HTML code, such that when I click the hello symbol, then it links to the source block where hello is defined. I understand that this cannot be done in all cases, e.g. when the definition is not present on the page, but in those cases the default export should happen. How do I do this?

I have a .cabal file which I want to change in order to enable e.g. threading and optimization (https://github.com/tweag/monad-bayes/blob/master/monad-bayes.cabal). Looking at it, I don&#x27;t see -O2 or -threading anywhere, so am I right in thinking those things aren&#x27;t happening, or am I looking in the wrong place?

                              <span>Hi!
 I followed the tutorial from Thoughtbot regarding writing a REST server in Haskell with Snap. Now, I want to parse data from this query string http://localhost:8000/sth?param&#x3D;value.
 I tried with getQueryParam but doesn&#x27;t seem to work.
 Code example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell -- in routes (&quot;/sth?param&quot;, method GET getHandler)
 -- in getHandler getHandler &#x3D; do params &lt;- getQueryParam &quot;param&quot; modifyResponse $ setHeader &quot;Content-type&quot; &quot;application/json&quot; maybe (writeBS &quot;must specify echo/param in URL&quot;) writeBS params
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Really don&#x27;t know how to continue, and I need that format to be backward compatible with the API served by a server that I want to replace with the Haskel implementation.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I &#x27;ve been working as a software developer for the past 9 years and in the past year I started learning Haskell and FP in general. I know enough Haskell to make some simple projects (interactive clis, web server JSON endpoints) but those are toys projects and for sure not following best Haskell practices. 
 So, based on the above I have two questions. 
 Firstly what are the next concepts/libraries that someone like me should learn? What are some good resources for production code best practices?
 For reference this is just a list of the things that are in my TOLEARN list. 
  
mtl
 containers
 proper error handling
 lenses
 different preludes (RIO?)
 persistent
 conduit, pipes
  
Second, what would you be more interested to see in a demo project from a potential hire? Is the use of specific libraries (like the ones above) important or would you focus more on basic language understanding?
 Looking forward for your answers!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard in the past that it would be nice if decoding JSON in aeson could avoid the intermediate Value (for performance reasons?). What&#x27;s the alternative? What might the API look like without the intermediate Value?

                              <span>Good evening!
 I recently installed lsp-mode for the Node TypeScript project (using ts-ls) I&#x27;m working on at the moment, mainly just because I wanted lsp-rename. The problem is, it only works within src: If I rename a variable, then all files in src get updated, but not in my test directory, tests.
 A lead: If I delete .lsp-session-v1, then open a file in the test dir, then start LSP (and thus import the project) from that buffer, then lsp-rename (on a file in src) will also affect that one file in the test directory, but not others. ~/.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1 contains no mention of the test file or dir in this case. It also doesn&#x27;t work any more if I restart Emacs after this.
 I thought lsp-workspace-folders-add sounded good, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything except make it so that the rename doesn&#x27;t even work across the files in src any more either.
 Tried renaming test to tests, didn&#x27;t work. The fact that it searches src even though .lsp-session-v1 only mentions the root directory indicates that it has some fixed folder mappings. Adding more of these would probably be the best solution. But how do I do this? I&#x27;m not very advanced with this package or Emacs in general.

 defining a key-binding under a prefix in my general.el setup.
 If not in dired-mode though it still displays the &quot;/ -&gt; Dired-details&quot; string in the mini-buffer after hitting the prefix key. 
 I tried adding :major-modes &#x27;(dired-mode) to the sexp where this binding is described. Doing that yields &quot;/ -&gt; nil&quot; in the mini-buffer for that key-binding when not in dired-mode.
 What I&#x27;d like is the binding for &quot;/&quot; under that prefix to not show up at all if not in dired-mode. Is there a way to accomplish this?

                              <span>I have a macbook hooked up to an external monitor and use an external keyboard. I&#x27;ve already set it up in the MacOS terminal to use alt (option) keys as Meta in the options menu. So, I would like to disable the Right-Alt (option) key being recognised as Meta and use it to type special characters. I&#x27;ve found the setting (setq mac-right-option-modifier nil) and added it to my settings file (~/.emacs).
 Problem: If I launch Emacs program through Finder as any other program the setting in the .emacs works fine: 
 - Left-Alt &#x3D; Meta key - Right-Alt is just Alt key 
 However, if I launch Emacs through the terminal (the way I would like to use it) the Right-Alt (option) key is still being recognised as Meta key. Is there a way to fix this?
 This is the setting that I have in my .emacs config file:
 (setq mac-right-option-modifier nil) 
  
OS: MacOS Monterey
 Emacs version: 28.1

                              <span>So. this just started happening yesterday. When I save a file I&#x27;ve been editing it tells me someone else already has the file open, although it&#x27;s only my laptop and the username is the same. The server name sometime changes depending on whether I&#x27;ve been using my VPN or not though. I&#x27;m confused since I&#x27;ve used the VPN many times before and this never happened, but it&#x27;s extremely inconvenient. 
 I can prevent using lock files I suppose but that seems like overkill, and this wasn&#x27;t an issue previously. Anyone with advice would be greatly(!) appreciated :)

                              <span>I use org-mode to manage my life (like any sane person would do :P) and also I use Feynman technique (it is super useful, look it up if you&#x27;re interested) to learn new stuff or keep up with my chain of thoughts. Originally the Feynman technique involved with writing your thoughts, questions that you have and things that you learn in a notebook and review them later. Using a notebook is really inefficient to me coz it&#x27;s hard for me to carry around one to take notes. I used to leave voice messages to myself via my phone and later on manually transcribe them and move them to an org file to organize them.
 Finally I spend a bit of time and created a bot that converts telegram (just because it was easier at the moment. Otherwise it would be easy enough to create backends for the bot to use matrix or whatever) voice messages to org-mode entries and store them in an org-file. It&#x27;s trainable as well. So one can train it to be more precise. Therefore the more you use it the more precise it can get.It still is rough around the edges and I need to feature tune it, but it is usable and I use it all the time. I thought other people might have the same needs as I have so it might worth sharing.
 Heads up though, the bot is in golang (coz I wanted to finish it up fast, but I have plans to create a native Emacs module for it to replace the golang implementation)
 The repository is at: https://devheroes.codes/lxsameer/Orion
 Also it comes with a text to speech engine (Rigel dir in the same repo) as well that spins up a tcp server and reads out anything that it receives over the socket. This one is trainable as well. Since I use Emacs as my window manager (thank you folks who made EXWM) I wrote a simple client that reads any text that i want in any program for me. Refer to the read me for more info and you can find the elisp client at: https://devheroes.codes/FG42/FG42/src/branch/master/core/cubes/rigel/core.el
 Hope you find it useful and looking forward to your feedback :)

                              <span>On Emacs 27.2 I am trying to get notifications to work on my KDE desktop. Please note that notifications work just fine on my XFCE desktop.
 I can reproduce the issue easily:
 ELISP&gt; (notifications-notify) 
 Which produces the following error message:
 Error: (dbus-error &quot;No connection to bus&quot; session) 
 I have tried to run dbus-launch before starting emacs but I get the same behavior.
 Any ideas on what the problem is?

                              <span>Edit: I think I figured it out but I&#x27;m going to leave this in case it helps someone else. The &quot;dimness&quot; of the rendered face was coming from the italic property of the face (which is not set in the face customization). All italic strings just get dimmer with any TERM configuration that doesn&#x27;t support italics (like xterm-256color or screen-256color). If I set $TERM to rxvt-unicode-256color, italics actually work!
 Due to issues with WSLg in Windows 11 (a long and disappointing story), I&#x27;ve switched back to using emacs in the terminal. Everything works as expected, except for a couple of face colors in Org Agenda.
 Though the attribute face sample in the customize facility looks correct, the actual face is always a dimmed version of that color (and that is how it appears in Org Agenda as well). This has the effect of making the text nearly illegible in most cases, and I refuse to choose an artificially bright color here because it appears correctly on other devices.
 I have cleared all other face attributes and still this odd issue persists. I&#x27;ve even inspected the face applied to the preview (&quot;sample&quot;) text itself in customize and nothing seems out of the ordinary.
 Why is it not displaying the color that I have chosen??
 In this image, with foreground set to brightwhite, the face sample looks gray.
 In this image, with foreground set to color-82, the face sample look like a dark green.
 I&#x27;ve also fiddled with the color &quot;themes&quot; of my terminal, but those settings have no effect on Emacs, it seems that Emacs is displaying exactly the colors it wants to.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>The goal is to make C-x  and C-x C- keybindings more accessible since they offer a lot of possible and useful commands, but unfortunately, keybinding itself is uncomfortable for a lot of people using standard keyboards. My solution is (in evil normal mode):
 Pressing  and then  acts as C-x  . implementing this is really simple:
  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) (general-simulate-key &quot;C-x&quot;)) 
 Note: I&#x27;m using general.el package for convenience, if you know how to do the same with built-in functionality, leave a comment.
 Unfortunately there is still a lot of C-x C- type of keybindings, which you still need to reach for control key after pressing space. Solution might be:
 while holding  press  acts same as C-x C-. 
 Examples:
 -s &#x3D;&#x3D; C-x C-s
  s &#x3D;&#x3D; C-x s
 -k-a &#x3D;&#x3D; C-x C-k C-a
 -k a &#x3D;&#x3D; C-x C-k a
 -q-w e -r t y &#x3D;&#x3D; C-x C-q C-w e C-r t y
 If there is some kind of method or hack to check if  is held, this solution becomes possible, making imo emacs a lot less painful to use.

                              <span>I have a problem that I think is related to space width.
 In the dashboard the text is not centered anymore, but with whitespace-mode it&#x27;s fixed, since it replaces every space with another character.
  
with whitespace mode active: https://imgur.com/NwfhXLX
 
without: https://imgur.com/2ZeqAMZ
 
 In a regular c file, again the space width is inconsistent with the tab width (8 spaces to tab)

 I&#x27;m using MesloLGS NF everywhere I can see inside M-x customize, and I even put :spacing m in init.el in custom-set-faces but doesn&#x27;t work.
 How do you set spacing just for the space character? Are there other settings that determine font other than in customize -&gt; faces -&gt; basic faces -&gt; default? How do I debut problems with font faces?
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve nuked my init.el file and now everything works, unfortunately I can&#x27;t replicate the weird font config that caused different width spaces. :(. Extra info: deleting font cache (sudo atsutil databases -remove) did nothing.

                              <span>Consider the following snippets:
 &#x60;# -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: tdp # key: ^^ # group: math # condition: (and (texmathp) &#x27;auto) # -- ^{$1}$0 
 and 
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: set # key: set # group: math # condition: (and (texmathp) &#x27;auto) # -- \\{ $1 \\} 
 I would like to expand on different conditions. By default Yasnippet only expands at word boundaries, so for example fooset doesn&#x27;t expand, you have to type a space between the snippet that you want to expand. As you can see this is a problem with the first snippet because I would like to expand x^^3 to x^{3}. I looked for a solution to this problem and found this
  (setq yas-key-syntaxes &#x27;(yas-longest-key-from-whitespace &quot;w_.()&quot; &quot;w_.&quot; &quot;w_&quot; &quot;w&quot;)) 
 which let&#x27;s me expand snippet on non-word boundaries. So now I can expand x^^3 to x^{3}. 
 However now the problem I have is with the set snippet. I would like that the set snippet follows the default behavior because when I type \subset the snippet is triggered when I type &quot;set&quot;. Is there any way to tell yasnippet to expand the first snippet always and the second one on word boundaries?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like my org-mode code blocks to look like &quot;blocks&quot; and I&#x27;m not sure if the :extend face property can do this.
 Context
 I delineate org-mode code blocks by setting the org-block face background to a slightly different color than my default background and setting its :extend text property to make the block look a bit cleaner (extends the color change to the end of the window).
 However, I&#x27;d like the background color change to render as a block, extending only partially, rather than the way:extend normally behaves -- extending to the end of the window.
 Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi all
 have been having trouble getting lsp-mode/eglot to work with tramp and python virtual environments. I can get lsp mode to work with tramp, but not respect python virtual environments. I have had a play around with pyvenv, but had no luck. 
 My current solution is to open a separate terminal, activate virtual environment and start pylsp from there over tcp, and then connect to it with port forwarding to allow eglot to connect to it. 
 Wondering if anyone has any suggestions or configuration examples on how they work with something like this. Doesn&#x27;t have to be eglot either, just using it now as is easy to connect to existing lsp server with tcp.
 Cheers :)

Type &quot;emacs&quot; in the search bar. Feel elated as I see there is a whole Emacs community with 50 thousand people!! 
 I just reinstalled Linux for the first time in like 15 years and I can&#x27;t wait to muck around and have some fun doing some coding and using it for work and all that fun stuff!

                              <span>Switching from windows to MacOS I encounter a strange problem.
 One of my keybindings is C-f6 to switch to fundamental mode.
 Another keybinding is C-f12 for save and exit. Not working. M-x describe-key says: &quot;C-f12 is undefined.&quot;
 Then I change it, keybinding C-f12 to switch to fundamental mode: now working! What??
 Then, another exmaple: on windows I had a keybinding C-M- to unfold org headlines.
 On mac not working (yes, I have changed command to meta), but it doesnt work.
 M-x describe-keys says &quot;C-M-down is undefinded&quot;, so emacs recognizes control-meta and cursor down correctly, but somehow its not linked to my custom function. Why? Why? Why?
 I&#x27;m about to explode. Tried whole night to fix/understand it ... I begin to believe my init file is haunted.
 I hope somebody has a tip for me what&#x27;s going on, I would be super thankful.

 Does Emacs have a similar feature? I know one can use C-l to lift the last line to the top of the visible buffer .

                              <span>Greetings, sorry for this long post, but I feel I need to provide full context to better explain myself.
After several weeks of deliberation (and lots of reading on the Internet), I finally decided to start my very own Zettelkasten. However, right from the beginning, I&#x27;m having trouble deciding how I should lay out my notes in better accordance to the ZK method. I was hoping somebody in this forum would be kind enough to provide some guidance.
So here&#x27;s the complete scenario: I&#x27;m using Obsidian as my ZK platform and I decided to start by transferring some of my old notes into zettels. These particular notes are just a summary of a single chapter of an introductory book about cell biology. I guess one could say that these are literature notes or bibliographic notes, since they do not contai…</span>

                              <span>I have been using Netbeans since 2009 I think. It doesn&#x27;t support scala. The attachment to this IDE is literally the single biggest reason stopping me from jumping to scala. It is not like I haven&#x27;t worked on something/anything else. I have a high resistance to learning new languages, somehow I learnt javascript, HTML, css etc. Now to move to newer domains I need to say bye-bye to IDE. Any inspirational comments, stories?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am a Haskell/cabal/GHC noob. I am also not a dev by profession - I am just trying to learn Haskell because.......Cardano. I am currently tinkering with cabal and I am trying to integrate Nix to it. According to the cabal documentation, I should just pass cabal --enable-nix, but the terminal screams cabal: no command given (try --help). How do I fix this?
 Also, is it necessary to edit the global configuration file to enable nix integration? If so where do I find $HOME/.cabal/config? I am on Windows 10, but I installed Haskell/GHC/cabal/nix using WSL2.
 Thank you in advance for any advice I could get!

                              <span>I want to parallelize a computation, and am not sure how to go about it. Basically, I have a type that&#x27;s roughly t [] a (for some monad transformer t), and computation happens in this monad (t []). The length of the list (usually around 1000) rarely (possibly never?) changes during computation, but using the monad incurs a lot of mapping over the elements of the list so what I&#x27;d like is a datatype that is efficient for this purpose, presumably by making the functor instance do the mapping in parallel. Is there a way to do that? (I saw https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa and also https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dph-seq-0.5.1.1/docs/Data-Array-Parallel.html but wasn&#x27;t sure if that was the right approach).

 Your thoughts on how I can better implement this would be much appreciated! I look forward to making more cool stuff with Haskell!

                              <span>The MonadFail docs say that
  
fail s should be a left zero for &gt;&gt;&#x3D;, [i.e.] fail s &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; fail s
  
But given that fail s :: forall a. m a is there any way that it couldn&#x27;t be a left zero? It seems like it should always be a left zero by parametricity (as usual with parametricity I have intuition about its consequences but no ability to actually prove them).
 Can anyone find a monad m, types a and b, an action mfail :: forall t. m t, and a function f :: a -&gt; b where mfail &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f is not equal to mfail?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to build Emacs 28.1 on an RPi with Raspbian. Specs:
  Linux weefree 5.10.52-v7l+ #1441 SMP Tue Aug 3 18:11:56 BST 2021 armv7l GNU/Linux 
 Emacs build configured with:
  ./configure --prefix&#x3D;/opt/emacs-28.1 --without-x --with-json --with-native-compilation 
 Build fails with: 
 make[2]: Entering directory &#x27;/tmp/qC7TOyomw6/emacs-28.1/lisp&#x27; ELC allout.elc make[2]: *** [Makefile:316: allout.elc] Segmentation fault make[2]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/qC7TOyomw6/emacs-28.1/lisp&#x27; make[1]: *** [Makefile:350: compile-main] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/qC7TOyomw6/emacs-28.1/lisp&#x27; make: *** [Makefile:436: lisp] Error 2 
 Anybody else run into this and (hopefully) know a fix?
 Update: adding --disable-year2038 to the ./configure args seems to have fixed this!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m running Fedora 36 (beta). And my laptop has a 4K display (Dell XPS 9305) so I have it running at 200% scale + Large Fonts (GNOME Accessibility option).
 But I also often use a 1080p display on the side, which runs at different DPI and 100% scale on Wayland. 
 Most apps when moved from one display to the other kinda work. But not Emacs, when I move Emacs to the 1080p display all letters are gigantic (like 200% gigantic).
 How can I make Emacs adapt to the different scale/DPI settings on the different monitors?
 I had a similar setup on Windows 11 and had not seen that happen.
 Emacs 28, vanilla; With mixed-pitch fonts.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to make some of my own elisp functions to mimic the vscode terminal functionality (a window with a smaller vterm buffer). Here is what I have now:
  (defun open-term () (interactive) (split-window-vertically) (other-window 1) (vterm)) 
 It works, but the window is too big. How can I reduce the size of the window?

                              <span>I use markdown-mode for viewing and editing markdown files, typically with the .md extension. 
 I recently changed my markdown-mode config to also use variable-pitch-mode. 
 It seems that some part of lsp-mode is loading markdown-mode for rendering and in that case I don&#x27;t want to use variable-pitch-mode.
 I tried:
 (use-package markdown-mode :mode ((&quot;\\.md$&quot; . gfm-mode) (&quot;\\.mkd$&quot; . gfm-mode)) :diminish markdown-live-preview-mode :config (setq markdown-command &quot;multimarkdown&quot;) (unless (bound-and-true-p lsp-mode) (variable-pitch-mode 1))) 
 Sadly this doesn&#x27;t work. I guess at the spot in lsp-mode that calls (require &#x27;markdown-mode) that lsp-mode is not yet fully loaded so the unless expression is not preventing the call to (variable-pitch-mode 1). 
 So how can I make markdown-mode use variable-pitch-mode but not when it&#x27;s loaded by lsp-mode.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs, but I don&#x27;t think that matters for this issue. I want to create a TODO from an email. I use mu4e for email and a file todo.org to hold my tasks and projects.
 Here is my org-capture-templates:
 (setq org-capture-templates 
 &#x27;((&quot;t&quot; &quot;TODO item&quot; entry 
 (file+headline &quot;todo.org&quot; &quot;Inbox&quot;) 
 &quot;* TODO %?&quot;) 
 (&quot;m&quot; &quot;TODO email&quot; entry 
 (file+headline &quot;todo.org&quot; &quot;Inbox&quot;) 
 &quot;* TODO %?\n%a\n%i&quot;))) 
 (Why did that skip every other line?)
 I have a horizontal split with the left window showing todo.org and the right window mu4e headers. I put my cursor on an email header, invoke org-capture-templates, choose &#x27;m&#x27;, and a new TODO appears with the subject serving as the link to the email. Very cool. This part works great.
 Now I&#x27;m ready to get to that email. Cursor on the email link, either C-c C-o, or just ENTER, and now my left window has been split with the header for that email showing in the top left of the frame, the body on the lower left with the cursor in the body of the email, and the right hand window just shows the header of the email (same as what the top left shows).
 Not at all what I expected. To get out of this mess after reading that email, I can q out of the lower left window, and SPC b l to get back to todo.org, Then SPC w w to get to the right window, and SPC b l to get back to mu4e headers. 
 A lot of farting around with windows. Is this how it&#x27;s supposed to work?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on this because the most popular solution didn&#x27;t work, and now that I figured it out, I want to post it so that, maybe, I help someone with the same problem as I had.
 To change the cursor color on emacs depending if you are or not in god mode you put the following code into your init.el file.
  (defun hook-update-cursor () (cond ((or (bound-and-true-p god-mode) (bound-and-true-p god-global-mode)) (set-cursor-color &quot;lime green&quot;)) (t (set-cursor-color &quot;cornflower blue&quot;)))) (add-hook &#x27;buffer-list-update-hook &#x27;hook-update-cursor) 
 If that doesn&#x27;t work, try this other one.
 (defun my-god-mode-update-cursor () (cond (god-local-mode (set-cursor-color &quot;lime green&quot;)) (t (set-cursor-color &quot;cornflower blue&quot;)))) (add-hook &#x27;post-command-hook &#x27;my-god-mode-update-cursor) 
 The latter works for me, while the first doesn&#x27;t.
 I hope I helped!!!!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just set up mu4e in vanilla emacs. By default, if I have a view buffer and a headers buffer open, and I press j to look at the next email in the headers buffer emacs automatically moves my cursor to the view buffer. I see why this would be useful for some, but for me it&#x27;s a significant annoyance. Is there a way to disable this behaviour? i.e. so that it changes the view buffer but leaves my focus on the header buffer

 I think auto-suggestions come to slow after passing some latter I mean, more than 3-4 latter it comes in. But I want, as soon as I press a single latter it comes in.

                              <span>some of the events in my .emacs file take a while to load their buffers and emacs runs the next statements before they are done loading, messing up the buffer order. I found out that those events have hooks but I do not know how to use them since the demo had the hook run a function and I want to avoid putting the rest of .emacs in a function because of a few events.

                              <span>I discovered Emacs via Doom Emacs. Then I switched to Vanilla in order to try the shortcuts. And I have to admit that vanilla shortcuts seems more easy to me.
 But I wonder if should stick to vanilla or switch back to Doom Emacs.
 Things to consider: - quite new to Emacs - reading the manual - want to use it for Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, CSS, Sass, shortly said Web development - want to take notes (I tried Inkdrop but I would do the same directly with Emacs) like markdown files or Org files if it&#x27;s compatible 
 Do you have any advice?

                              <span>Dear fellow Emacsers...
 I&#x27;m looking for a simple solution for managing web bookmarks inside emacs and org-mode. I was sure that someone would have already done it, but it looks like I&#x27;m not using the adequate keywords since I&#x27;m not getting the expected results (surely the problem is with my expectations, as any Buddhist can happily say ). ;P
 There are a few known and documented solutions interacting other bookmarkers...:
  
Buku; https://www.opensourceforu.com/2018/05/buku-a-bookmark-manager-in-the-command-line/
 bm; https://owendavies.net/articles/super-lightweight-bookmarks-manager-dmenu-bookmarks-with-bm/
  
... but I&#x27;d like to have everything integrated in emacs really. And if it&#x27;s in org-mode if possible, even better.
 Something related but not the all-emacsy solution I&#x27;d like is ht…</span>

2022 Week 16
Last Week
Met with the New York Times writer Carl Zimmer as part of JAMM328 and found the conversation a wealth of ideas, many captured in ZK.
Trouble with near_search.py. Can you hear my screams?
Started a historical fiction novella using ZK! Excited about the prospects. I&#x27;m going backpacking to the protagonist&#x27;s gravesite in the Rapid River Wild and Scenic River Area for research next weekend.
Refreshed kestrelcreek.com adding the Scientist Profile I wrote using my early ZK/Writing workflow described in a forum post.
This Week
Final writing assignment in JAMM328 Science Writing - an Op-ed.
Registration for next term opens Friday at 3 PM for me.
Prepping for the first backpacking trip of the year.
Trivia.
These are the titles of the last few notes I&#x27;ve created and am excited about. Show me yours! We are interested in seeing what you are up to, even if you have one or two newish zettel to share!

                              <span>Today I bought my first Apple Computer (Mac mini M1) although having been anxious not to be able to install emacs on Mac (emacs is my absolute number 1 and my life depends on it so to say).
 And indeed I couldnt install emacs 28 from https://emacsformacosx.com/ as the Mac gave an error (not able to scan for malicious content), but then I tried 27.2 ... again the same error but it allowed 27.2 to open nontheless.
 So far so good ... but now I&#x27;m stuck because I don&#x27;t know where to place my init file (tried to put in different places like trial and error but ... no, not working). I googled a lot but couldn&#x27;t find the solution. There has been said to put it in ~/.emacs but I dont understand where to find it.
 Also it seems Mac OS doesn&#x27;t allow to create .emacs.d folder as there&#x27;s a dot at the beginning.
 So does anybody know where can I place my init.el?
 Maybe total n00b question because Mac OS is unknown territory also I&#x27;m no coder just a prose writer ... but I love emacs :)

 I&#x27;m using few packages that rely upon node but for some reason emacs doesn&#x27;t detect node even though its installed(using brew). As you can see by output of executable-find node is detected with the installed packages

                              <span>I have a org roam note that presents matrix multiplication and it looks fine in org mode as shown below.

 However, when I run org-roam-ui, the browser does not show the matrix multiplication in the correct format. It just gives me the latex syntax as shown below. It works fine when I am just presenting equations, but it does not seem to work properly for matrix multiplications.

 When I hover over the red text, I get the following info and I am wondering why this works on org mode but not with org-roam-ui.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve installed eglot aiming for a very lightweight and minimal lsp experience for Rust and C (basically just some autompletions and some errors shown). My configuration looks something like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package eglot) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((c++-mode c-mode) &quot;clangd&quot;)) (add-hook &#x27;rust-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure) (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure)
 (use-package company) (global-company-mode)
 (use-package yasnippet) (yas-global-mode 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 There&#x27;re a few problems with this, though. On Rust mode, everytime I hover over a keyword, it opens like two buffers: One floating, and one on the bottom. All I want are some completions and some errors. How can I disable all the frills of eglot and rust analyzer?

                              <span>There are at least two fundamental ways of reading email. The first, and the one I think is more common, is to open the inbox and choose an email to read from the list. Let&#x27;s call it the random access method. The other method is to open an email, preferably the oldest unread one, and when you are done open the next one by pressing a &quot;next email&quot; button. Let&#x27;s call it the linked list method. 
 When I read email using the random access method I frequently ignore email I feel are annoying to deal with. I also get drained of energy by having to repeatedly choose which emails to read. The linked list method on the other hand side steps both issues: I only have to make the single decision to read email and then I read the entire inbox.
 This package was born from the realization that I like the linked list method, and that I would like to handle more things this way. So what el-secretario does is that it turns different sources (e.g. org-mode todo items or RSS feeds) into linked list-style inboxes. And it doesn&#x27;t stop there, it can also link different lists together so that email, org-mode items and RSS feeds come under the same unified inbox.

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;ve switched to Emacs with Evil Mode and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks but I am missing a very important feature (at least for me it is important). In vim you can reformat text with &quot;gq{motion}&quot; to format lines. It uses external programs to do so. However in Evil Mode I cannot seem to find its equivalent. Is there any solution to that? I Googled the problem but couldn&#x27;t find the solution there either. Thank you!

                              <span>This is a soft nudge to those who haven&#x27;t yet installed tree-sitter. I had to inspect a 27MB json-file, about 1500000 lines, pretty-printed. Emacs warned about a really huge file, opened quickly nonetheless.
 Changing text at the bottom was extremely sluggish. Disabling font-lock-mode made Emacs instantaneous.
 After installing tree-sitter and enabling tree-sitter-hl-mode the edit experience is fantastic. Editing this large json file, Emacs is still slightly laggy but it is light-years better than with the regexp-based font-locking.
 Also tried tree-sitter while editing golang, no issues whatsoever. If you haven&#x27;t installed tree-sitter yet, you should.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I need some big help. I spent almost all day trying to make a recursive version of linear search (indexof) of a list but I can&#x27;t seem to make it work. I&#x27;ve checked online sources but they are far too complicated. Is there any easy implementation?
 search :: a -&gt; [a] -&gt; b 
 returns index if found or -1 if not found

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have a file path that I get from dired or from buffer-file-name - something like /a/b/c/d.pdf . I want to use this file path to create an org link that I can then insert into an org file. I believe the link is usually of the form file:/a/b/c/d.pdf. I want to add a description which should be d.pdf.
 Initially, I thought it would be easy to call org-store-link and pass in the file path and description to make it store the link but I checked the source code and the only useful argument that org-store-link takes is &quot;arg&quot; which doesn&#x27;t seem to be what I want.
 I am still learning elisp so any pointers to a solution? Thanks

                              <span>Hello community, Just announcing a small JavaScript add-on I wrote for Org-mode exported HTML documents, which allows you to filter the page content based on heading tags when viewing it in a web browser.
 I found that all the tags in my growing journal document where not really being useful in HTML-exported form, so there was my motivation. Posting here as other HTML-exporting org-mode users may find it useful. (It&#x27;s still in very early stages, written during the last couple of days, but it works for me.)

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing an org babel implementation, and one thing that I&#x27;d like is to be able to embed proper line-numbers pointing back to my .org file in my language code. So for example, if I had a file /some/path/foo.org containing
 * Some header #+begin_src julia function foo() 1 end foo() #+end_src some text 
 and then if someone did org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c on that src block, I want my implementation of org-babel-execute:julia to know that the code it receives came from /some/path/foo.org at line numbers 4-8.
 Does anyone know how to accomplish this?

 Usually NixPkgs is pretty fresh, but there&#x27;s no activity.
 Something I&#x27;m missing? Do you run Emacs using a flake instead?

 I am having issues where emacs is breaking my programming flow by popping up new buffers in the wrong windows. Is there a package where I can decide what goes where?
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like buffers to pop up in the active window, and some sort of functionality that allows me to easily move a buffer to a different window (like move the active buffer to the window on the left). 
 Does something like this exist, and if not, what are the alternatives?

 Hey Emacsers,
 Do you know rg.el?
 rg.el is an Emacs UI for the cli ripgrep.
 What does that mean?
 Well...
 Let&#x27;s say we want to learn how to write Elisp macros because it seems to fit with the problem we are facing. We&#x27;ve already read the info node about macros (M-x eval-expression RET (info &quot;(elisp)Macros&quot;)) that contains many examples but we want more examples.
 We know that macros are defined with the macro defmacro, so why don&#x27;t we search for calls of defmacro in Emacs source code to get usage examples of it?
 In the directory where we&#x27;ve cloned Emacs source code we can run the following command line (in a terminal) that searches directories for the regexp \(defmacro that are of type elisp, while respecting gitignore us…</span>

On the one hand, we can use EWW for text and image only web interactions, but on the other hand finding websites that are intended to be viewed in a text based browser can be a challenge.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has thought about trying to serve org documents directly, and use emacs as the browser. Org is basically equivalent to html in expressive power, and in places where it&#x27;s not, it can be extended. Most websites would do well to be formatted like an org document and I&#x27;m sure many here would prefer reading documents online in org format, since if they were, then we&#x27;d get the benefit of emacs style navigation through them on the user&#x27;s terms.

                              <span>I recently started using Linux Mint 20.03, and Emacs starts up with two panes (one above the other). This happens when, e.g., I type:
 emacs anyfile
 I have searched the usual places, /etc/emacs, /usr/local/share/emacs, and so on, but can&#x27;t figure out where this behavior is being set.
 What is the simplest way to override this behavior, and just get a single pane with a buffer on &quot;anyfile&quot;. (I don&#x27;t want to have to type: control-x-1 each time).

                              <span>Is there a good cURL(or HTTPie) client for Emacs?
 I’m asking this because of how simple Magit made Git for me. Is there a similar TUI “intuitive” interface for cURL?
 I’m not looking for a similar tool - I want an interface for using cURL.

 OS: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS, Gnome 3.36.8
 Emacs: GNU Emacs 28.1 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.20, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2022-04-06; installed from the current stable snap package
 Firefox: 99.0 (edit for additional info: Firefox is installed via apt not snap, Chromium (see later) is installed via snap)
 To reproduce in emacs -q: M-x browse-url-firefox RET (url)
 (I’m using the wordle url to test but any url I put in place of my placeholder (url) in that command does the same).
 Expected behaviour: the url is opened in my already running instance of firefox as a new tab or if there isn’t one then it runs a new instance of firefox that uses my profile.

                              <span>What I need:
 Using org-capture-finalize in org-capture-mode while having some certain text, example (&quot;* TODO \n&quot;) exits without doing anything (similar to the functionality of org-capture-kill)
 My progress:
  (defun my-finalize-if-no-todo () (interactive) (setq matches (count-matches &quot;* TODO \n&quot; 0)) (if (&#x3D; matches 1) (org-capture-kill) ;; Should be changed to function properly nil )) (add-hook &#x27;org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook #&#x27;my-finalize-if-no-todo) ;; Is this the right hook to use? 
 Post notes:
 I tried to figure out how org-capture-kill does it, and it seems that it sets org-note-abort to t, but I am not sure how to do that in a hook. I tried to use setq and let, but I didn&#x27;t manage to make it work.
 I am noob when it comes to Emacs and Emacs Lisp, so the answer might be simple.

                              <span>As we all know, we can view file changes in Magit directly:
 Magit changes
 The problem is, all the changes are displayed in a single Emacs window, sometimes I&#x27;m not sure which change belongs to which file. I know that I can go up to get the file name, but I feel it&#x27;s a little inconvenient.
 I&#x27;m more accustomed to the UI that other text editors / IDEs are using, in which files are displayed on the left, and changes are displayed on the right. 
 ​
 VSCode&#x27;s git changes
 The point is, I want to make sure that an Emacs window only shows changes in one file. When I go to the end of the window, I arrive at the end of the changes in the current file, instead of continually checking the next file&#x27;s changes.
 Can I do it in Magit?

                              <span>I’m looking for ideas to upgrade our scala based applications to 2.13 from 2.11 and use jkd11 from 8. I saw tools like scalafix, openrewrite which will help with the upgrades. But the way we have our set is - we have 30+ micro services and each of them generate a client artefact which will be used in other service. For example service A talks to B via B-Client which. For scala I guess I have to generate 2 clients (for 2.11 and 2.13 if I’m upgrading one service at a time) but not sure what to do with JDK. Should I keep release target to 8?

                              <span>Hi Haskell-community
 I learned some Haskell as part of a university course in programming paradigms and discovered that I like the language (and especially its theoretical underpinnings). However, I have not yet really been able to integrate it into my daily computer usage, apart from occasionally tinkering with my xmonad configuration and similar. Therefore, I would like to hear what you use Haskell for, to get some ideas and inspiration for what I could do with it myself. For example, do you use it only for work, or also for hobby projects (and if so, what could that for example be)? Or do you use it to automate tasks or process data (instead of, say, a scripting language like bash or python)?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently a mentor for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) under Haskell.org. If you&#x27;re interested working on some exciting Haskell projects over the summer while earning a stipend for your work and being part of a blossoming community then join our community discord to learn more about us and the programme. This year GSoC has removed the requirements of being a student to participate so anyone 18 and older can participate. We have projects for beginners and intermediates as well as those for more advanced users.
 The stipend that you&#x27;ll receive is based on the Purchasing Power Parity of the country that you&#x27;re currently living in and whether you choose to do a medium (175 hour) or large (350 hour) project. The specifics can be found here: https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends

 I&#x27;m trying to re-write the below function in do notation for learning purpose- 
 removeNonUppercase :: [Char] -&gt; [Char] removeNonUppercase st &#x3D; [ c | c &lt;- st, c &#x60;elem&#x60; [&#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27;]] 
 NB. The function is borrowed from http://learnyouahaskell.com/. 
 Can you folks help me by giving a bit of hint?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m looking for a command that would start making a link to some org entry. It should work similar to org-insert-link, but instead of asking to write or paste the link it would allow one to go to some org entry and press (say) &quot;enter&quot; there which would run org-id-get-create, and then store the gotten id as the link target.
 Does such a command already exist? (in a package perhaps)

                              <span>I am running Evil mode under Doom in a terminal Emacs on macOS. My * Vim register doesn&#x27;t seem to be hooked up to the system clipboard. (Normally in Vim if you yank to &quot;* your text goes into the system clipboard, and you can also paste from the system clipboard by pasting from &quot;*.) Is there a way to make the * register work?

                              <span>Hi all,
 It&#x27;s been around a year since I jumped into Doom with no prior Emacs experience, so far I&#x27;ve become quite comfortable with using org mode (with evil) for writing reports.
 At this point I&#x27;m really interested in learning more about emacs, and possibly starting from scratch, as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s much better for learning than a pre-rolled config.
 Thing is, the few things that I&#x27;ve tried to do so far often ended up breaking my thesis setup, and I&#x27;m pretty hesitant to further experiment since &quot;I broke my text editor, so I didn&#x27;t meet the deadline&quot; is really not a risk I want to take. 
 My goal is to somehow have a separate vanilla emacs installation/configuration, that I can just tweak from scratch, but which is totally isolated from the installation/configuration that I use to write my thesis.
 What would be a good (important: foolproof) way to accomplish this?

                              <span>All my work is in Windows. I saw a post the other day about Windows binaries with AOT.
 Some questions I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out:
 - Native comp&#x27;d files are .eln (as opposed to .elc). Does it work like before, the .eln lives along side the .el?
 - Does it just speed up load time, or is there performance improvement even after it&#x27;s been loaded?
 - Do the Emacs 28 binaries on the GNU FTP server have Native Comp?
 - Is AOT something different than Native Comp? It compiles in the background?
 - How do I Native Comp an .el file? Byte-Compile as usual??
 ​
 Sorry for the super newbie questions.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve set up lsp-mode, lsp-ui, lsp-ivy and company to work on my javascript files. As LS I am using the theia-ide recommended one.
 In my working enviroment I use Mozilla Rhino as the js engine so the syntax may be sometimes different to the standard javascript. Unfortunatly there isn&#x27;t a LS specifically designed for Rhino.
 Everything seems to work fine except for the completion of imported files. In Rhino the import statement for loading another js file is load(&#x27;/path/to/js/file&#x27;) and what I am missing in my workspace is completions and suggestions for variables, functions and other stuff defined other files different from the one I&#x27;m working on.
  (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot; lsp-auto-guess-root t lsp-clients-typescript-npm-location &quot;/usr/local/bin/npm&quot;) ;; tuning (setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000 read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024) lsp-idle-delay 0.5) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t)) (use-package lsp-ui :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :custom (lsp-ui-doc-position &#x27;bottom)) (use-package lsp-ivy :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ivy-mode)) (use-package company :after lsp-mode :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode) :bind (:map company-active-map (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-selection)) (:map lsp-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . company-indent-or-complete-common)) :custom (company-minimum-prefix-length 1) (company-idle-delay 0.0)) 
 In addition I have also a minimal configuration for js2-mode that I&#x27;m leaving here.
  (use-package js2-mode :mode &quot;\\.js\\&#x27;&quot; :hook (js2-mode . lsp-deferred) :config (setq js2-basic-offset 2)) (use-package js2-refactor) (use-package xref-js2) 
 If anything is unclear or needs more specification just tell me. 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ve recently started using Haskell since it is required for a formal methods class at my university, and I love it so far.
 I wrote my first project in it, a typing speed test for terminals. However I&#x27;ve only used oop-languages before, so I&#x27;m not sure whether I followed best practices when writing this. For example, I used data records to store the current state of the program in, and most functions operate on this data type. To me this seems kind of like reinventing oop-concepts in a functional language.
 The main logic of the program is found in app/TestState.hs, and app/UI.hs is responsible for drawing the tui. I sorted the functions by their usecase, exported functions coming first. I wrote a lot of internal functions for readability, and kept them pointfree when possible (is this sensible?)
 The code is available here.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback on these points or on my code structure in general. Thanks for your help :)

                              <span>With very little haskell and zero prior chess engine experience it proved to be quite the wild ride.
 I feel i&#x27;ve made some very dubious code choices, especially in the move generation and move application departement (I really wanted to avoid using branching where possible so i abused the pattern matching as much as possible).
 I believe the GameTree code turned out to be fairly solid, though you&#x27;re more than free to disagree.
 I&#x27;d love some feedback mainly regarding the &quot;haskell-ness&quot; of the code and what i could improve on.
 The engine is still a bit too slow for my liking (It beats stockfish 4/5, depending on the heuristic, with about 5 seconds per move) so I am thinking about reworking the move generation to use pin maps instead of generating pseudo-legal moves first.
 There is one small bug that is really annoying me: The engine doesn&#x27;t detect threefold-repetition, even though it should be using the transposition table to keep track of what positions it&#x27;s seen before. I&#x27;d be elated if someone manages to find an explanation for that.
 The code is here:
 https://github.com/stu214634/Chesskell
 Since this was a learning project the code quality varies greatly, still i hope it isn&#x27;t too atrocious.
 Edit: Due to the way the transposition table is implemented building and running with multiple threads causes significant slow-down.

 However, I am stuck at the first step of building the library from source on my own computer. I tried to build using stack but it fails. It&#x27;s searching for a package version greater than a certain number, but it cannot find it. 
 I can install the package with no problem using cabal install --lib hmatrix, but is that useful for development / bug fixing?

                              <span>Hi all, my knowledge of any sort of scripting/coding is pretty limited, so forgive me for what may be a stupid question!
I was wondering whether it is possible with JSON to add a line that would colour citekeys separately from the main body text? Perhaps by applying a rule specifically to text within single brackets [ ] or words beginning with an @ symbol?
Cheers!</span>

                              <span>How can I make a line with a form feed character stay visible in any and every cycle state?
 I changed my org-outline-regexp to include the \f form feed character:
 &quot;\\(\\*+ \\|[\f]\\)&quot; 
 And I can now successfully go to the form feed character via consult-outline but this does not affect org-cycle. I&#x27;d like to show a line with the ^L form feed character as a separator even if it doesn&#x27;t start with an asterisk.
 In plain outline-mode, this already works. Cycling now shows the line with the form feed character in any cycle state.
  
In case you want to insert the character in a file yourself for testing:
 (insert &quot;\n\u000c\n&quot;) 
 For display of a separator line I&#x27;m using https://github.com/purcell/page-break-lines/ or https://depp.brause.cc/form-feed/ if someone is interested.

 Is there a way to make sure they are always applied when I call org-latex-export-to-pdf? It feels tedious to include these in every org file.

The tablet has no browser but allows OCR of the handwritten text. It natively supports PDF and it&#x27;s annotations.
 Would be glad to hear that others make use of this combo... eink + org-mode.

Would be happy to host something or use a third party application. Davmail comes to my mind, but I never was able to get it running, continously. Ideally it should run on a server to make sure that it does it&#x27;s job independent of the PC state.

having the code land in the main repository to get deployed in production.
Sounds simple, right? Write code, merge it; repeat. Well, it gets more
complicated than that.

In this post, I describe why it can get difficult to merge contributions
and ways to circumvent these difficulties. My analysis applies
both to software consultants and also to open source contributors,
in a context where pull requests must be made and approved by a reviewer before merging.
I will go through a sequence of tips and tricks to have code land faster.
There is no silver bullet in this domain but rather a list of recommended
practices.

                              <span>The Haskell docs require any monoid to have left identity, right identity and associativity.
 Associativity would imply that it supports full parallelism.
 According to the docs[1] and my local testing the &quot;fold is right-associative&quot;.
 Why? I mean, if one wants to process it serially, they could just use the normal foldl or foldr?

 Today I visit their site and the install procedure points to GHCup, which I&#x27;ve never seen before.
 Is this brand new? Or did I just miss it before because their Downloads page is ordered backwards? FYI, to any haskell contribs here: put the recommended installation instructions at the top of the page, and the open-ended advanced options underneath it. And specify that they are so.

                              <span>It is clear that eta reduction can make the code more terse (sometimes at the expense of readability, as in the cases where variable name helps to explain the purpose of the argument).But I vaguely remember seeing some comments somewhere that it has some performance implications (something like GHC not doing some optimizations on eta reduced functions). Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it anymore.
 Is there any known impact of implementing functions with arguments expanded / eta reduced? Is one of those preferable (and if so, under what circumstances?) from the perspective of writing more performant code?

                              <span>I am having trouble understanding the general implementation of a binary tree. I am new to functional programming, and the assignment our professor assigned is given below. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Using the following definition of a binary tree:
 data T &#x3D; Leaf | Node T T deriving (Eq, Show)
 And the following datatype represents a traversal of a binary tree:
 data P &#x3D; GoLeft P | GoRight P | This deriving (Eq, Show)
 Where This represents the entire tree. Now define the following function:
 allpaths :: T -&gt; [P]
 Which given a T outputs all possible paths, P, from the root of the given tree to each of its subtrees. 
 Given input should outcome the desired output:
 allPaths (Node Leaf (Node Leaf Leaf)) 
 Output : [This,GoLeft This,GoRight This,GoRight (GoLeft This),GoRight (GoRight This)] 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ​
 I did the following, but I cant seem to find why my output is slightly off. Can you please help me figure this out.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 allpathsHelper&#x27; :: T -&gt; P -&gt; [P]

 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!!

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 A few weeks ago we put out Copilot 3.8. Copilot is a Runtime Verification framework that compiles to hard real-time C99. The effort at present is on stability, cleaning, and providing further assurances with the code generated. Copilot 3.8 now includes further unit tests, and we continue to polish the interface, as well as the internals. Additionally, we are now also following a much more thorough development process in order to meet requirements needed to use Copilot at NASA; the process will ensure not only that we develop Copilot up to agency standards, but also that our team can scale up in the future.
 I&#x27;ve also put out a new version of Ogma (1.0.2). Ogma is a tool that takes high level languages and produces Copilot monitors. Public changes to Ogma have been geared towa…</span>

 Is there a way how I can specify directories for my org-refile-targets instead of having to add each file individually?
 I tried a plausible solution that I found on the interweb but it didn&#x27;t work
 (setq org-refile-targets &#x27;((&quot;~/.notes/note1.org&quot; :maxlevel . 1) ((directory-files-recursively &quot;~/.notes/&quot; &quot;^[a-z0-9]*.org$&quot;).( :maxlevel . 1)))) 
 the above gives me the following error when I attempt to run the org-refile command: Wrong type argument: stringp, directory-files-recursively

                              <span>Hi. I had a problem with my org agenda a while back which suddenly appeared. I always got the message: Search failed: &quot;\\]+\\)&gt;&quot; and the agenda stays empty.
 I could fix this after some days by downgrading the version of org mode. After a while I upgraded doom emacs and everyting worked fine again.
 Now I&#x27;m using my Laptop. Here I got the same problem mentioned first. But this time I have a much further update of doom. Additionally the old org mode version which fixed it previously, when using the exact same commit of the org mode package, doesn&#x27;t fix the problem.
 Does someone else have this problem. It&#x27;s either really hard to find something to this because of all the symbols or almost no one had this problem before.

                              <span>Forgive me if this has been already answered. My google-fu is not that good and I&#x27;m having hard time formulating the search query. So, how do I prevent tramp from creating the files that start with .#&gt; on the remote machine. If disabling is not possibile, can I move them to a temporary a directory? The build process look for all files in a directory and do some compiling and these files break the build process. To exclude the files starting with .#, I have to modify the build process, which sadly I&#x27;m not allowed to do. So, my only hope is to change the way tramp generate those files. Is there any way?
 I&#x27;m not even sure whether it is tramp which is generating those files, I would appreciate any help. Thank you

                              <span>I compare two .emacs files - one is from my work computer, the other from my personal computer.
 Changes in these two files are quite evenly distributed. When I compare these two files with ediff, a first n completely highlights both files, one mostly in orange, the other one mostly in green. I guess that&#x27;s because the diffing algorithm considers it to be one hunk? I see the details in words / lines by a visual difference in color. A second n unhighlights and a third n tells me there is no further difference list.
 Now this behavior is not very helpful. However, if I press ! I see all changes in detail and can easily navigate with n, p and copy changes a, b between the two files.
 One file uses cr/lf line endings (coming from Windows), the other only lf (Linux)
 Is it normal to press ! after an ediff session start? Is the initial all is different because of different newline encoding? How to ignore different newlines on first place?

                              <span>So few things to set the scene:
  
I use emacs with server mode (i.e. emacsclient)
 I am running on Wayland (29.x - using native pgtk)
 Lately I have a need to occasionally ssh into my desktop from another machine running wayland session, edit/view things. Occasionally read email + open PDFs etc, and I want to be able to copy-paste into the emacsclient frame from remote host
 Emacs on terminal over ssh can copy-paste, but can&#x27;t easily view PDFs etc. And GUI emacs over waypipe opens external programs on remote host by default and copy-paste is broken too.
  
Now why the problem with GUI happens: * When emacs starts on host A it takes environment from that host (the important part being WAYLAND_DISPLAY being equal to wayland-1 or whatever) * Things work fine on host A... * I move to host B a…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I want to share I package that I have developed, which is egerrit, an integration of the Gerrit Code Review inside of Emacs. For more information and screenshots see my blog post https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/gerrit_in_emacs/
 Here is some of its features:
  
A customizable dashboard
 Gerrit specific actions, such as setting WIP, topic, rebase a change etc.
 A review mode, with the ability to review a patch diff and add comments that can be published
 Functionality to automatically checkout out a copy of the change that is being reviewed so the change can be explored in its completeness
 A list of conversations with the ability to use it to jump directly to source code when interacting with feedback on a patch of yours
  
The package only uses built Emacs functionality, so its easy to install. If it sounds interesting feel free to try it out, the source code can be found here https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/egerrit :)

 Hey Elispers,
 Do you want to expand your Elisp toolbox?
 In this post we look at the catch/throw pattern offered by Elisp that allows to do nonlocal exits with the function throw that can be caught by the catch special form.
 For instance, in the following snippet, in a catch block:
  
we define a local list l,
 then we loop forever ((while t ...)),
 in this loop we generate a random (integer) number between 0 and 9,
 then:
  
 if this number is not equal to 1, we add it to the list l and we repeat,
 and if it is equal to 1, the throw statement transfers the control to the enclosing catch with the tag :one (we leave out the while loop and also the let block) which returns immediately the builded list l (last argument of the …</span>

                              <span>I would like to use iv-counsel only with certain keybindings, like accessing my org-roam files and when invoking M-x. However, it seems to take over everything. I especially don&#x27;t want it for invoking find-file. Can someone maybe help me with a hook that could achieve this?

 I want to copy this to another buffer, just as seen. So I do C-SPC on the top one, move down, C-SPC to mark the region, then C-w to copy to buffer.
 C-x o to move to other buffer, C-y and then... I get the entire agenda list, not the filtered result. Why does it do this, and how might I achieve my desired result?

 Emacs has few important widgets built-in. If you are using them, it would be helpful to know that you can customize their icons.

                              <span>So I have this system with three windows, window A, B and C, and window A opens files, window B is for testing/running/research and window C has dired to mess around with files.
 each of them has buffers it opens and buffers it should be opening. I want to customize the buffer order (the thing C-x LEFT and C-x RIGHT cycle through) so window A only opens files, window B only opens a language shell (typically python), a terminal or eww and window C only opens dired
 for example the two shortcuts should cycle like this
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; scratch
 Messages
 GNU Emacs
 buffer buffer
 Python
 ansi-term
 eww
 buffer buffer
 dired
 buffer buffer
 file A
 file B
 file C &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; with the buffer buffers being buffers between buffers to signal to me not to pass it when cycling through buffers.
 the problem is I cant fix the order in place and there are always buffers getting stuck between the ones I need to cycle through

                              <span>When using ivy-switch-buffer, the candidates have colors, but when using projectile-switch-buffer, all candidates have the same color. I want to colorize the items based on the extension. How could I do that?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi , I&#x27;m looking for a way to resolve a problem after having setup my scala environment on Jupyter notebook.
 After preliminary research , similer problems originated from either cassandra connector failing to be configured properly or PATH encironment variables not set . 
 I made a couple posts on stack overflow looking for help but also thought my case required a more targeted audience so have a look at both questions :
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71844044/setting-up-scala-for-jupyter-notebook 
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71732234/configuring-environment-variables-for-scala-jupyter-notebook
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>After many months of stealth development it has come the time to publicly announce Spekka. Spekka is a library with the goal of making the development of streaming micro-services easier and more productive.
 The library is built on and extends Akka Streams, so should feel pretty familiar to any hakkers.
 If you&#x27;re reading this and do not know how to spend the next 15 minutes, take a look at the microsite and maybe try to give the library a spin. If then you&#x27;re also willing to give back some feedback I promise to buy you a beer should we ever meet :-).
 Here&#x27;s the link to the micro-site: https://spekka.github.io

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking to create an interactive form, that fills out headers in an org-capture template.
 I don&#x27;t want to &quot;just&quot; use the minibuffer, because it looks like a single line of text. I want to be able to fill in paragraphs of text within the minibuffer (or other kind of buffer), to be used interactively in the function.
 This way I can fill out a form in a multi-stage process. And it fills out an org file&#x27;s headers, rather than e.g. a csv file if I used form-mode.
 Is this possible? Any alternatives that one might be able to recommend?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I apologize for the possibly annoying question, but I&#x27;m struggling to get Emacs 28&#x27;s nativecomp to work. There are plenty of guides/posts online about installing libgccjit with Homebrew to get it to work.
 But, I&#x27;ve been using MacPorts for a long time and really don&#x27;t have any desire to use both MacPorts and Homebrew.
 When I install any of the usual suspect Emacs packages in MacPorts (emacs-app, emacs-mac-app, etc), I get the same issue when Emacs starts up: it floods the *Warnings* buffer with stuff like:
  
Warning (comp): collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status Disable showing Disable logging
 Warning (comp): libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver Disable showing Disable logging
 Warning (comp): /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/outline.el.gz: Error: Internal native compiler error failed to compile Disable showing Disable logging
  
Now, this is totally normal when GCC and/or libgccjit are not present, and a web search of these errors will find several forums posts and bug reports, etc. The Homebrew crowd just installs some specific GCC package and all is well for them.
 I pretty quickly realized that macOS&#x27;s clang is aliased (or soft-linked, or something- I didn&#x27;t investigate) to gcc. So, I suspected that I needed to install the real GCC from MacPorts. Since my $PATH has my ports directory prepended, running gcc from a shell does in fact call the correct, true, GCC.
 However, I suspect that Emacs still doesn&#x27;t see the correct GCC when it starts up. If you&#x27;re familiar with macOS and Emacs, you might know what I&#x27;m talking about when I say that I do use the exec-path-from-shell Emacs package, but I assume that it does its thing too late in the start-up process to help me.
 Does anyone know a straight-forward way to either change the GCC path(s) for Emacs early enough to matter, or just some other way to get nativecomp working with only using stuff from MacPorts?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 On the heels of last week thread about evil mode, I wanted to ask if there&#x27;s a good guide to getting started with evil?
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs with evil mode for a couple of years, but there&#x27;s always something that seems to be breaking or misbehaving.
 The latest thing that was bugging me was undo-tree wasn&#x27;t properly integrated with evil, so sometimes it just wouldn&#x27;t work - even after I spent time looking into it.
 I dont need evil in minibuffer, but some commands are just too ingrained now (dd, G, / and so forth) that switching evil mode off is just as painful as keeping it on and living with issues.
 Is there a robust way to get evil mode going? A guide? Much as I love modal editing my only other option is to embrace emacs way and disable evil.

                              <span>As part of my day to day work I write a lot of documentation, primarily in org-mode. Lately I&#x27;ve been documenting some SQL we&#x27;ve been using for a project, which happily opens in a separate buffer to edit, and works great. However when I save the buffer (C-c &#x27; ) and return to the main document buffer my keyboard direction appears reversed. So far I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful in determining a setting or switch that might be triggered to cause this, and the only way I&#x27;ve had to reverse the input flow is to close and re-open emacs. What am I missing here?

                              <span>There was a feature in Ivy that allows you to hide dotfiles (or any regex that you want to specify) until you input a leading dot into the search query, is there anything similar with Vertico? It&#x27;s a really nice feature to declutter hidden files from your search results.

                              <span>I use org-roam in Emacs a lot, and sometimes I need to search for something in multiple files. Currently, my choice is counsel-ag and ivy. But I&#x27;m not having a good time with it. The reason is as follows.
 In other modern text editors like VSCode or JetBrains, the search panel is always there when I&#x27;m searching. I can click on any search result on it, view/edit the target file, while in the meantime the search panel doesn&#x27;t disappear. But in counsel-ag, the bottom search panel disappears when I hit the Enter or Esc key on a search result. Can I just fix the bottom search panel and never let it disappear (Unless I explicitly let it disappear using C-x 0, just like other Emacs windows)?

                              <span>I learned that recent Emacs (is it 28.1? I am using bleeding edge 29.0) gained native support for sqlite datebases, sqlite-mode-open-file works great.
 Can I combine this with markdown fenced code block in a way that
 sql select 1; 
 is using a sqlite-Database?
 The same question applies in principle to org-mode too, where such a functionality would be fantastic too.

                              <span>As passive entertainment, I find livecoding streams satisfying. There is a community of Twitch streamers who use neo/vim. But there aren&#x27;t enough emacs livestreamers. I found tsoding and j_blow but that&#x27;s it. There is an old reddit thread asking for emacs streamers but it&#x27;s too old. I was wondering if you guys know any other regular emacs streamers.
 Got some response in the comments. I&#x27;m gonna keep updating this list:
  
tsoding - Twitch
 Jonathan Blow - Twitch
 Flux Harmonic - YouTube
 System Crafters - YouTube
 facetious_coding - Twitch
 XahLee - YouTube
  Andrew Tropin - YouTube

                              <span>Dear Emacs-fellas,
 I am using Wanderlust for emails. I can&#x27;t find out, how to:
  
in Summary mode (buffer) I have some marked messages (with *), as a result of searching or manual selection,
 those marked messages are not on the same page, so I need to scroll the buffer to see them,
 so is there any way how to kill (suppress) the unmarked messages, so there are not displayed (but off course, they will not be deleted)?
  
I&#x27;ve read the manual, but I can&#x27;t find thre relevant answer.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Normally in Haskell code you can just put:
 module  where 
 at the top of one file, and then use any code from that file in a second file by including:
 import  
 at the head of your second file. However, I&#x27;m not sure how to do this for happy files, since the code defining the parser in happy is technically not Haskell... I think... happy files end in a &#x27;.y&#x27;, not a &#x27;.hs&#x27;, and they have different syntax, for the most part. So, does anyone know how to break up a large happy parser into multiple modules/files?
 Edit: Specifically, its the grammar section that I want to break into multiple files

 Using the same type signature k want to create a one line recursive function that does the same thing. I asked a similar question earlier however it was the opposite process. 
 To start it would be hello k strs &#x3D; [ something | something ]
 Can anyone help me grasp this better?

 I am not being able to quite grasp how the above follows from:
 fmap length :: (Functor f, Foldable t) &#x3D;&gt; f (t a) -&gt; f Int
 and Just :: a -&gt; Maybe a
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Over on lobster.rs, there was a post about the the Visitor Pattern in Swift, which reminded me that all the patterns is is what we often refer to in Haskell/CT as a catamorphism (I&#x27;m not going to claim to be a CT expert, or even novice, so please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).
 I wrote a comment on the post that I thought might actually be better here: 
 When learning functional programming, the day you learn what a catamorphism is, is an enlightening day. There&#x27;s a lot of boilerplate here for what is essentially the definition of a sum type, and a function which takes one argument corresponding to each constructor. In Haskell, the first few catamorphisms people are generally introduced to are:
 bool :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool -&gt; a bool f t b &#x3D; case b of False -&gt; f True -&gt; t maybe :: b -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Ma…</span>

 3 :: Int 
 But on my ghci (v 8.10), it outputs: 
 3 :: Num p &#x3D;&gt; p 
 Why is this? Thanks in advance

looked at a thread about shortcuts, and some of the conversation may as well have been in Martian for all the sense it made
to me!
I&#x27;ve only created a few notes so far; but if a certain level of computer jargon is required in order to use this, then would I be better off to try Obsidian instead?</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m reorganizing my Zettelkasten. Part of that involves combining multiple sub-atomic Zettels into a single Zettel. The thing is, removing the old Zettels manually can be time-consuming, specially if they&#x27;re many.
In my case, performing one or multiple searches will turn up all of the Zettels. Also, in some cases, the Zettels&#x27; unique identifiers are listed in a different Zettel. Perhaps there&#x27;s a way to remove the Zettels given a list of unique identifiers. And in fact, there is. That&#x27;s the solution that user Raffa over at Askubuntu proposed: https://askubuntu.com/a/1401828/1555551
I didn&#x27;t consider Obsidian, my Zettelkasten software, because there&#x27;s no feature to help with this and I don&#x27;t trust third-party plugins.
Hopefully this knowledge is of use to someone.</span>

For anyone who speaks German: Would you mind translating any of these cards from German to English?
Here&#x27;s a list of some cards to choose from:
https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3347_R
https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3338_R

https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3344_V
https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_BG2a_3346_R
You&#x27;re welcome to choose whichever one(s) are easiest. His handwriting seems a bit difficult to parse on them.
It would be great to see the nature of Luhmann&#x27;s individual bibnotes in English.
I can, of course, hire a translator myself. However, I wanted to ask the Zettelkasten community here first in case there are any good samaritans that can help!

                              <span>Hi, while implementing a type level natural numbers in Scala, I ran into problems when defining &quot;less-than&quot; in terms of &quot;less-or-equal-than&quot;. Specifically, given the following:
 trait Nat class Zero extends Nat class Succ[A &lt;: Nat] extends Nat trait &lt;&#x3D;[A &lt;: Nat, B &lt;: Nat] { ... } 
 I&#x27;d like to define trait &lt;[A &lt;: Nat, B &lt;: Nat] in terms of &lt;&#x3D;, noting that &lt;[A, B] if and only if &lt;&#x3D;[A, Succ[B]]. I tried writing,
 object &lt; { def apply[A &lt;: Nat, B &lt;: Nat](implicit lt: &lt;&#x3D;[A, Succ[B]]): &lt;[A, B] &#x3D; lt } 
 but this does not typecheck. It seems to me that I need some sort of casting to turn an instance of &lt; into &lt;&#x3D;, which should be possible.
 How would one go about doing this?

I want to hear how you guys started with vanilla emacs so I can finally force myself to learn it during spring break.

                              <span>dsq by Multiprocess Labs is a command line tool that allows for running SQL queries against multiple files of a growing number of supported types (JSON, CSV, many more) as database tables and for joining between them.
 Spending half my day in Org mode, I created ob-dsq.el, which adds Org tables, Org source block results, and basically any valid Org reference to the list of supported input types.
 I wrote a quick blog post to demo the package&#x27;s basic usage. Its repository includes a bunch of examples showcasing all features in detail.
 Shoutout to Multiprocess Labs for this awesome tool!

I think that I have everything set up. I ran gem install solargraph just like the LSP documentation says to do. Am I missing a step? 
 I noticed that without LSP turned on there is still some linting going on. Is that the LSP? Is it just included in ruby mode? Any information that you guys have on this would be helpful. Thank you in advance!

 I&#x27;m fairly certain that eglot is not invoking the auto-formatting, because 1) I&#x27;ve disabled auto-formatting capabilities in eglot-ignored-server-capabilities and 2) the auto-formatting doesn&#x27;t revert the buffer automatically.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am trying to wrap my head around completions in emacs. To begin, I am not sure what the definition of &#x27;completion&#x27; in the context of emacs is, so I am using the term quite vaguely. It is unfortunate, but is perhaps a good indication of where my emacs knowledge stands right now. 
 I have figured out that packages like selectrum and vertico shape how minibuffer suggestions appear on the screen. From the vertico page, I then moved on to consult. My current understanding is that packages like ivy/helm/consult provide enhancements to emacs commands (and perhaps also introduce some new commands) for buffer selection, register selection etc., including algorithms and interfaces for showing sensible possible options for the minibuffer prompt. 
 However, where I totally get lost is company. What does company do? I am experimenting with lsp-mode, and it suggests using company. Does company also do the same thing as consult? 
 Any comments and suggestions like links to pages which explain this ecosystem would be awesome.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Is there a link to building emacs from source for the M1, there are plenty out there... but some are a few months old and not very concise... I use brew but that builds the intel version if you build from source.
 I don&#x27;t use the GUI, but from terminal and I prefer to build it for terminal.
 Thanks ahead of time

                              <span>Hi. I guess this is your once in a while odd thread. :) 
 I’ll start from the get go. I have always been rather fascinated with keyboard and cli only life. Just breeze through everything with commands burned into muscle memory. Feel like the computer is an extension of your brain.
 Fate made me a lawyer. I don’t write code and nothing even close. here’s what I do with my mac:
  
I read documents, laws, verdicts and the occasional city plan pdf file (Am a real-estate lawyer). 
 Write legal documents and opinions for clients
 Read and write many emails in several languages (right-to-left and left-to-right languages). Around 30% of my regular work day is dedicated to emails really. Extremely vital
 Manage personal calendar appointments via outlook (clients go through my secretaries)
 Manage personal To-do lists
 Listen to music, mostly through spotify or youtube 
 Browse interesting subreddits here and there
 listen to podcasts and audio books.
  
That basically summarizes it. 
 Now I’ve actually read and watched a fair share of information regarding EMACS. The ORG intrigues me quite a bit. But I don’t really know if i’m barking up the wrong tree.
 Do you think something like EMACS, as a window manager (on arch probably, which I installed before and liked the Pacman a lot) can replace all these different softwares (from outlook, preview, spotify [which i know has a cli version!], MS word, MS excel, safari) and act as a seamless “one-stop-shop”?
 Or am I better just sticking out to my iMac and dealing with current workflow. 
 Thanks in advance! I’m very much excited reading your answers! Have an awesome day!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am trying to add a new language server for lsp-mode. My current configuration to add it is this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defgroup lsp-gobra nil &quot;LSP group for gobra.&quot; :group &#x27;lsp-mode)
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;lsp-mode (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(gobra-mode . &quot;gobra&quot;)))
 (defcustom lsp-gobra-executable &quot;
&quot; &quot;Command to start the Gobra language server.&quot; :group &#x27;lsp-gobra :risky t :type &#x27;file)
 (defun lsp-gobra-server-command () &quot;Startup command for Gobra language server.&quot; (format &quot;java -jar %s&quot; lsp-gobra-executable))
 (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection #&#x27;lsp-gobra-server-command) :major-modes &#x27;(gobra-mode) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;gobra&quot;) :priority -1 :server-id &#x27;gobra)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have already defined a major mode called gobra-mode which is enabled when I open a gobra file. This configuration doesn&#x27;t seem to start the jar file server. Manually starting lsp mode in a gobra-mode buffer doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything either. Any ideas?

                              <span>Im trying to set up lsp mode with java however i get a message that the lsp server has stopped everytime i try starting it. From searching the error online, i get that it has something to do with lsp-java-workspace but how do you set in the .emacs. file? I&#x27;m thinking its something like (setq-default lsp-java-workspace) but not exactly sure. Also does it work with any version of java or do i need a specific version?

[2022-04-11 Mon] Fiercely protect your daily agenda
 From my experience with to-do apps and ORG-MODE, I&#x27;ve come to learn that I need to protect my daily agenda, or it will simply grow and grow and grow. What I mean here by &quot;daily agenda&quot; is the list of things that I look at each day, or throughout the day, to determine those few things that I&#x27;m going to actually accomplish. As a microcosmic view, I might have the following on that list:
  
Status Meeting at 9 am
 Pick up clothes from cleaners
 Send happy birthday email to my second cousin&#x27;s daughter.
 Clean car to prep it for sale

 I want all my Emacs keybindings to be consistent and make sense (for me). However, this does not come by default. I want to start from a scratch, so I would like to unbind everything. All Emacs default bindings, and plugin bindings (with the exception of Evil Mode).
 Basically, I want to things:
  
A way to unbind all default bindings.
 A way to prevent a plugin from creating bindings.
  
How can I do this?
 EDIT:
 I tried removing the default bindings with this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (setq my-global-map (make-keymap))
 (substitute-key-definition &#x27;self-insert-command &#x27;self-insert-command my-global-map global-map)
 (use-global-map my-global-map) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It almost does the job, except that some keys stop working properly, like enter, backspace, and escape.

                              <span>So as an example of what I mean: say I have an optics modeling program in which you can have a material with a refractive index and thickness, as well as functions with that material
 type RI &#x3D; Double type Thickness &#x3D; Double data Material &#x3D; Material RI Thickness reflection :: Material -&gt; Double -&gt; .... reflection material wavelength &#x3D; ...... glass &#x3D; Material 1.5 100 water &#x3D; Material 1.3 200 
 But I could also just build a function that directly take the refractive index and thickness as arguments, and use the curried values to represent the materials
 reflection :: RI -&gt; Thickness -&gt; Double -&gt; .... reflection ri thickness wavelength &#x3D; .... glass &#x3D; reflection 1.5 100 water &#x3D; reflection 1.3 200 
 Are the disadvantages to using currying as a way to store values in this way?

 And in that they showed bind as taking Mb -&gt; (\b-&gt;Mc) -&gt; Mc
 So, basically converting Mb back to b and feeding it to (\b-&gt;Mc) 
 So, why not just have an extractor with type &gt;&gt;~ :: Mb-&gt;b ?
 Why have bind take in a function, versus just converting types and piping?

                              <span>3 days ago I accidentally discovered Zettelkasten! I was half watching a video on YouTube, and when it finished, a new video automatically played, which talked about a system called Zettelkasten. As it was explained, I realised this was exactly what I had been looking for, for years. Over the last few years I have read hundreds of books and listened to thousands of podcast episodes and diligently made notes on much of that content and then placed it in Evernote never to be seen again!
I&#x27;m still deciding on what tools to use to create my own Zettelkasten, and the Evernote tomb could be revived and used as a kind of fleeting notes folder, and then slowly go through the 12,000+ notes in there and transition them into literature/permanent notes, to convert that information into useable knowledge.
Since discovering that video, I have listened to an audiobook version of &quot;How to take smart notes&quot;, watched several videos from Bryan Jenks, Martin Adams and others, in order to have a really good understanding of how to go about setting up my first zettelkasten.</span>

                              <span>I became interested in the zettelkasten method over two years ago after reading Sönke Ahrens&#x27; book. I&#x27;ve maintained it with different levels of care since then but recently I&#x27;ve been looking at my notes and wondering if I should just start over.
I see a few problems with my notes:
1) There are too many notes that are not my own ideas, just things I&#x27;ve captured from other places. 
All this to say, I am thinking of starting anew. (I wouldn&#x27;t actually delete any of my existing notes.) I feel like I have too much of a mess on my hands and want to begin with a blank page.

                              <span>When having one file in two buffers, is it possible to have different subtrees visible in each buffer?
 I just tried and I see that cycling visibilty in one buffer cycles it in the other.
 ​
 It would be even better when it is possible to narrow the file in one buffer but not in the other.

                              <span>Hi,
 Recently a weird orange marker (like an orange ball) started to show up in the thin grey bar in the left margin next to newly-capture tasks. The orange ball survives a refile to elsewhere, however if I use &quot;Alt-up&quot; to move it in the org hierarchy, the orange ball disappears.
 Any ideas what this is? See screenshot.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello!
 I have some experience with Java, Kotlin and Scala. My favourite language by far is Scala, mostly because of their support for FP and monads compared to the other two. I just started in a new job where I am able to decide what language to use for our new backend. I would love to use Scala, however, finding the appropriate libraries/frameworks for Scala seems like a hassle. For Java/Kotlin its a no brainer : Spring Boot.
 Because of this, I&#x27;m not sure if its worth to go for Scala even. 
 I have been looking at:
 Rest api:
 Play - No support for Scala 3 yet?
 Http4s
 Cask
 Akka http
 DI:
 No library - Cake pattern (or any other way without any library)
 MacWire 
 Datebase access:
 Quill
 Doobie
 Slick
 ScalikeJDBC 
 Trying to find out what we should choose is giving me a headeache. In my earlier job we used
 Akka Http, Cake pattern and ScalikeJDBC, but I don&#x27;t want to use this stack just because I have experience in it. For example, a quick google search has shown me that the cake pattern really is not a good way to do DI (although I personally didn&#x27;t have any strong problems with it, although it did became a little bit messy when the code base grew big). It just seems much simpler just to pick Kotlin + Spring boot.
 What do you guys think?

 Fwiw, :results output works as intended.

                              <span>Hi,
 Yesterday I upgraded from Emacs 27.1 (Installed via emacs-mac) to Emacs 28.1 (installed via Homebrew).
 Everything seems to work fine so far, except Arabic ligatures are broken: for instance, لا (ل followed by ا) only shows a broken line. با and نا are also affected, and only the first half of the ب and the ن are shown. 
 لا باس
 Another thing I&#x27;m noticing is that punctuation behavior got worse: if I type a comma, for instance, it&#x27;s shown at the far right of the sentence, until I type the next letter, and then the comma is where it should be.
 ​
 Is there anything I can do to fix this?
 ​
 Thank you
 ​
 Edit: attach and fix screenshot

 (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)
 (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/Dropbox/org-roam&quot;))

 The issue is that PLAN.org buffer never has the org-mode enabled, and I always have to enable it manually.
 How can I fix this?

 I tried clearing all *.elc files in the repo directory, but the problem still exists
 find . -iname &quot;*.elc&quot; -type f | xargs sudo rm
 How should I resolve it?

                              <span>Hi, is there a way to get autocompletion for REPL-like interactive programs like python-repl, ghci or nix-shell using eshell? Whenever I press TAB in such programs I get a pcomplete-completions-at-point failed to return valid completion data! and even though the key was sent correctly, I don&#x27;t see the results on the screen e.g. in python-repl when I press tab after pri I still see pri but what&#x27;s actually entered is print(.

                              <span>There is no state in Haskell -- which is its main distinguishing feature.
 There are no classes in Haskell -- it&#x27;s not object-oriented.
 As you can clearly see if you search for Haskell programmer positions on job sites, there is definitely no money in Haskell.
 Whenever one encounters Haskell for the first time, they usually ask questions like &quot;but how do you do X without a state&quot; which Haskell programmers are tired of explaining.
 And a lot of people make a point that Haskell is a beautiful language in theory but isn&#x27;t very good in practice, which drives Haskell programmers up the wall.
 Conclusion: Haskell is communism.

                              <span>TLDR: Am I using ExceptT correctly?
 I recently understood a bit about monad transformers, so I wanted to use them in my application. I installed transformers and started in a small section of my code. The following example used to have a lot of pattern matching, and my code would drift toward the right as I added more case statements, so I refactored it using ExceptT.
  getActivityAggregate activityId -&gt; ExceptT.runExceptT $ do activity  maybe (Left (ActivityNotFound activityId)) Right &amp; ExceptT measurements  Right &amp; ExceptT ActivityAggregate.build activity measurements &amp; ExceptT.except &amp; ExceptT.withExceptT mapError where mapError (ActivityAggregate.NoMeasurements activity) &#x3D; NoMeasurements activity mapError (ActivityAggregate.MeasurementsFromAnotherActivity activity measurement) &#x3D; MeasurementsFromAnotherActivity activity measurement 
 I want to bring to your attention that when I have a monad containing an &#x60;Either, I wrap it in the ExceptT constructor. Am I doing this correctly? Am I missing some function that already does this? Is there a terser way of writing the same? Thanks

2022 Week 15
Last Week
Spent time developing programming chops.
Not much success picking up my reading pace in Effective Notetaking.
Created a new blogging workflow.
Started boxing training.
This Week
This week, I&#x27;ll meet with the New York Times writer Carl Zimmer as part of JAMM328.
I&#x27;ll be refining a shell script for inserting part of a note&#x27;s file name as a title as the note&#x27;s header.
Expanding on and refactoring zettel stemming from my ideas about thinking in built environments.
I will be reading some Rumi poetry that likely will stimulate ideas.
I&#x27;m currently reading: Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson and One Long River of Song by Brian Doyle
Trivia.
These are the titles of the last few notes I&#x27;ve created and am excited about. Show me yours! We are interested in seeing what you are up to, even if you have one or two newish zettel to share!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m thinking about taking up FP with Scala, but a friend advised that it&#x27;s a dying language, and moreover, whatever advantages it may have had have been mostly closed by newer Java/C# that now support FP constructs like immutable data structures/fields, higher order functions, streams/LINQ, pattern matching, lambdas, generics, etc. If you are well-versed in Java or C# and Scala, can you provide code examples based on real problems that demonstrate why Scala would still make a better choice than Java/C# today for new big projects?
 Thanks.

 I want to learn Scala 2. Is learning from the book &quot;Scala for the Impatient&quot; a good idea, or is it outdated? In the latter case, can you recommend something similar?

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the first release of the ordset library
 This is an implementation of a math concept of ordered sets and maps on various kinds of domains: bounded/unbounded, continuous/discrete. In essence ordered set or map can be viewed as a collection of intervals equipped with:
  
efficient search method to check whether element belongs to set;
 a suite of well known transformation operators: union, intersection, inversion, zip, map, flatMap, etc.
  
All implementations are thread-safe by design, cause underlying data structures are immutable and persistent (like immutable collections of standard library are).
 But please don&#x27;t confuse them with standard sorted sets, here are Scastie examples to demonstrate the difference. Also some basic concepts are described in project blog.
 The project is in active development now, i will be very grateful for any feedback or contribution.

                              <span>Hi all, I made this open-source editor+interpreter for flowcharts in ScalaJS: https://github.com/sacode387/FlowRun
 Website: https://flowrun.io/
 It is mainly targeted for beginners in programming. They can start with this visual representation, understand how it all works. It also generates real code for some programming languages (still WIP but usable). FlowRun is very similar to http://www.flowgorithm.org/index.html which only supports Windows.

 val va &#x3D; List(1,2,3,4,5) val f &#x3D; (x: Int, y: Int) &#x3D;&gt; x + y va.foldLeft(0)(f) 
 I do step by step compilation as followed.
 List(2,3,4,5).foldLeft(f(0)(1))(f) List(2,3,4,5).foldLeft(1)(f) List(3,4,5).foldLeft(f(1)(2))(f) List(3,4,5).foldLeft(3)(f) ... List(5).foldLeft(f(6)(4))(f) List(5).foldLeft(10)(f) Nil.foldLeft(f(10)(5))(f) Nil.foldLeft(15)(f) 15 
 am I correct?

                              <span>I use a transparent gnome-terminal (lately also gnome-console). With no custom theme the background of emacs behaves exactly like the terminal. If I use tango-dark however (or any other custom theme for that matter) the background transparency is all but gone.
 Is there a way to avoid this? I tried to edit the /usr/share/emacs/27.2/etc/themes/tango-dark-theme.el or a local copy of it, but I can&#x27;t find the line responsible for general background behaviour.

                              <span>So dired has this problem where directories open in new buffers. The wiki said dired+ had a command to fix it, but I did not know how to install it so I just copied the dired+.el file into the /usr/share/emacs/28.1/lisp directory. when I did (require &#x27;dired+.el) it worked but all the other things had .elc or .gz files and I&#x27;m not sure if I need that

 This happens when i call (rainbow-blocks-propertize-region (point-min) (point-max)), but as soon as i do anything like type or move the point or scroll, the properties of the first image disappear and the rainbow-blocks takes over the whole buffer, so all the saturated colours disappear, which i dont want. I want it to look like the second image all the time. This doesn&#x27;t happen when i set jit-lock-mode to nil, but then of course i dont have jit-lock. What should i do?

                              <span>I have an old version of gnutls on my system, which I cannot uninstall (no sudo permissions). Instead, I installed a local version in my home directory and set PKG_CONFIG_DIR to point to it so that when I call pkg-config -libs gnutls I get the correct paths
  -L/home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib -lgnutls 
 I then tried compiling emacs from source by calling ./configure and make but got a linking error.
  ld: gnutls.o: in function &#x60;Fgnutls_peer_status&#x27;: /home/user/emacs/src/gnutls.c:1505: undefined reference to &#x60;gnutls_session_etm_status&#x27; 
 Upon further inspection, I found that the linking command is something like this
  gcc -o temacs.tmp {CFLAGS} ... gnutls.o ... -L/usr/lib64 -lgtk-3 ... -L/home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib -lgnutls ... 
 The problem is that the old gnutls library in /usr/lib64 take precedence over the custom directory that is specified right before linking gnutls. I resolved this by changing the LIBGNUTLS_CFLAGS to include -L /home/user/.local/stow/gnutls/lib so that the this directory takes precedence over all other subsequent directories.
 This feels too hacky. Is there a better way to resolve?

                              <span>I love Emacs, but it seems that there is some &quot;simple&quot; things that are hard to do (while some hard things are so simple !)
 I&#x27;m trying to create a good writing config for my org-mode, but I&#x27;m facing something that I haven&#x27;t succeed to overcome : having a justify text mode that live wrap line, not inside word but instead use a variable letter/word spacing to do it, like in a LibreOffice writer document.
 I would like this :
 This is a long text that have been justify with adaptive word-spacing and without cut inside words ! 
 Not this : 
 This is a long text that have been justify wit hout adaptive word-spacing and with cuts insid e words ! 
 Or this :
 This is a long text that haven&#x27;t been justify there is just a limitation of the number of char by line with a line wrap. 
 Is it even possible ?
 Many thanks for your time lovely Emacs community ;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m fairly new to Emacs and was following this guide : https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/
 After writing to the init file it says:
  
By default, lsp-mode&#x27;s keybindings are available under s-l(Super-l), e. g. s-l h h will show documentation at point. You may change the default prefix by setting lsp-keymap-prefix.
  
and that shortcut does conflict with my system&#x27;s, so I wanted to make it something else, I&#x27;ve tried adding
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix (kbd &quot;s-z&quot;))
 before and after the entering of lsp-mode, when added before it gave an error, and when added after s-z remained undefined, my init file doesn&#x27;t contain anything other than the one mentioned in the link
 ​
 SOLVED: here&#x27;s how it should be done for lsp-keymap-prefix : https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/1532

 Would this be written in Haskell code as :

 charBag 1 &#x27;e&#x27; &#x27;y&#x27; &#x27;y&#x27; &#x27;z&#x27;

 or would it just be one line and look something like this?:
 charBag1 e y y z &#x3D; Bag -&gt; Char ??? Really confused on this

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing some fun code that does symbolic algebra, and a part of that is also evaluating the expressions after plugging in parameters for the variables. Actually, profiling shows that 50% of runtime is spent in expression evaluation, so I&#x27;m keen to optimise this as much as possible.
 ​
 Here&#x27;s an explicit example. Our expression has a simple data type definition.
 infixl 4 :+: infixl 5 :*: data Expr &#x3D; Const Double | Var !Int | Exp !Expr | !Expr :*: !Expr | !Expr :+: !Expr deriving (Eq, Generic, NFData) 
 Next, evaluation is done by plugging in a vector of parameters. Specific parameters are chosen by the Int in the Var constructor, which just acts as an index for the vector.
 type ParamState &#x3D; Vector Double evalWith :: ParamState -&gt; Expr -&gt; Double evalWith params expr &#x3D; case expr of Const c -&gt; c Var x -&gt; params ! x Exp a -&gt; exp (evalWith params a) a :+: b -&gt; evalWith params a + evalWith params b a :*: b -&gt; evalWith params a * evalWith params b 
 I can now define an equation of 6 variables as an expression, and evaluate with a vector of parameters. If I just write out the equation as a Haskell function, criterion says that it takes 9ns to run. The same equation in my Expr data type takes 70ns.
 This is by no means slow, but if half of my runtime is spent in evalWith, then every nanosecond counts!
 So, any ideas on improvements? Inlining evalWith seems to do nothing, I suppose due to the function being so simple already. Any help or insights would be appreciated :)

Effectively, I have a single scalar representing a cost and I have a Map of parameters. These were more or less nicely manipulated in a State monad that I use to formulate a the constraints I&#x27;m looking to optimize.
 Unfortunately, I cannot run the state monad with AD parameters because of the quantification involved ( it needs something with Num and Fractional, but has to pass in (forall s.

                              <span>First things first, thanks @ctietze for the script. I&#x27;m in the process of adding Structure Notes to my Zettelkasten and your script is perfect for part of the job involved.
However, I&#x27;ve run into the problem described in this post&#x27;s title. To make sure that I&#x27;m understood and to include all potentially important information, I&#x27;ll elaborate.
I have an outline whose filename is 202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md. It lists links in the same vein as the outline example from your post about the script. This file is in the home folder of my Ubuntu 21.10. The output of zettel_outline --version is zettel_outline 0.1.1 (2016-01-23). Nothing weird appears in the terminal when I run the script:
zettel_outline -f &#x27;202204091330 s2 Obsidian.md&#x27; -a /home/annabella/Archive/Zettelkasten/ -o draft.md

Everything seems fine at first in the draft. At a closer look, I find the whole content of a Zettel that wasn&#x27;t linked to, spread 16 times thorough it. Unlike the other Zettels, the  part doesn&#x27;t include its unique identifier. I checked my Zettelkasten to see if its unique identifier happened to be that of another Zettel, but it wasn&#x27;t the case. The Zettels from the outline don&#x27;t link to this Zettel and this Zettel doesn&#x27;t link to them.
Any idea of what I could be doing wrong? I&#x27;ll include any information you need on demand.</span>
