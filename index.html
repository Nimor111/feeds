                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a good setup working for typescript, using some basic lsp-mode and treesitter.
 I have vue-mode installed, but I am failing to have good syntax coloring of the script block.
 Does anybody have a good setup (pref. straight.el based) I can take a look at ?
 ​
 thx.S

 I love the concept of emacs and all its uses (buffering, controlling everything with the keyboard etc...) but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get more productivity using it instead of another IDE: (

                              <span>I recently started a new internship and have to use Windows (bleh). Surprisingly, porting my Emacs config over was painless. 
 A few days went by with no hiccups. Then seemingly out of nowhere, whenever I opened my Org files, all of my lines ended in dos carriage returns, ^M. Moreover, it opened a popup buffer that said there was an encoding conflict with the inputting encoding system and the underlying default. I didn&#x27;t document it and have been unable to reproduce it. 
 To get rid of it, I have to M-x revert-buffer-with-coding-system RET utf-8-dos every time I open an org-file. 
 Does anyone know of a more permanent solution? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 this problem is making me mad.I would like to be able to select \frac{any text}{any text}, I tried with evil-object but the documentation that i found is quite short. So I tried with emacs function:
 (defun select-latex-expression () &quot;Selects the entire LaTeX expression \\frac{any text}{any text}.&quot; (interactive) (search-backward &quot;\\frac{&quot; nil t) (backward-char) (set-mark (point)) (search-forward-regexp &quot;}[^\}]*&quot; nil t) (forward-char)) 
 This is what I came up with, but work only partially, and wrong sometimes.I could implement it?Thanks 
 EDIT: 
 (defun select-latex-frac () &quot;Visually selects the LaTeX fraction expression under point.&quot; (interactive) (save-excursion (re-search-backward &quot;\\\\frac{[^{}]*}{[^{}]*}&quot;) (setq start (match-beginning 0)) (setq end (match-end 0)) (evil-visual-make-selection start end))) 
 This work better but now I have some problem with expression like:
  \frac{\frac{prova}{prova}}{\sum^{}}

                              <span>Hi,
 I had written a package that allow using org-ql with org-roam:
 https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/org-roam-ql
 The idea was to make org-ql aware of the org-roam database. The package also allows viewing the content of an org-roam buffer in an org-ql-view buffer, which would allow querying based on the nodes, or vice versa, viewing the content of a org-ql-view in a org-roam-like buffer.
 Switching from an org-roam buffer to a org-ql buffer, narrowing the results using org-ql then rending the results in an org-roam-like buffer (which I am org-roam-ql buffers)
 Querty the org-roam database
 It&#x27;s my first package and I am still working on it. I would love to hear any feedback on it :)

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t figured out which package does this, but when I edit elisp files, it prints messages telling me to add module style comments and warns when I use setq that I&#x27;m assigning to a free variable. Is there a way to tell it to ignore these findings within a buffer or before an expression?

                              <span>I see several options to see my calendars from within Emacs. What I want to do is sync multiple Google calendars from different accounts and a couple calendars from a Nextcloud account to my emacs.
 I think I only need 1 way syncing (to emacs) for both Google and Nextcloud
 Is there any reason to choose one of the following over another? Are there any others to be aware of?

                              <span>&quot;The vital first step towards understanding a theory,&#x27; Popper (1972, p. 182) said, &quot;is to understand the problem situation in which it arises.&quot;1


In the spirit of this quote, I was thinking to myself, &quot;What is the problem situation that the ZKM was created for?&quot;
In the Introduction to the ZKM article @Sascha said that it, &quot;is a holistic method on how to deal with knowledge in your life.&quot; So, it would seem that it is, in part, helping with managing your knowledge outside of our memory system. I think elsewhere it is referred to as &quot;a personal tool for thinking and writing.&quot; Which, I think helps to see more of the picture of the problem situation. Knowledge. Thinking. Writing.
I&#x27;d love to hear some thoughts from others in this forum on how they&#x27;d answer this question.

I would love an option either in a right click menu or a keyboard shortcut to view the &quot;Get Info&quot;  (Mac) or Properties window. I would like to occasionally look up the creation date for my files. I don&#x27;t need this information often but I&#x27;d occasionally like to find the info. Going forward I&#x27;m adding this info in the text of my notes but I&#x27;ve imported years worth of notes from nvalt which I&#x27;d have to manually update with the creation date.
Thanks!</span>

                              <span>First off, apologies if there is a more sanctioned place to file bug reports instead of here at the Forum.
There is a file in the Archive that I have renamed (perhaps while it was open in the Archive). I have just one copy of the file. as confirmed by ls. And yet I see it twice in the Archive.


Restarting the Archive did not fix this issue. I don&#x27;t believe I have messed with ln and such here, so no symbolic links business is involved. Finally, all this is under git, in case that is somehow implicated.
I am at Archive 1.7.7.
Any ideas?</span>

 I try to use the status200 from http-types in a stack project.
 but I can&#x27;t use it because it is a hidden package or something.
 I added the http-types to the package.yaml
 and I tried to add this package to the stack.yaml/extra-deps:
 with http-types-0.3.12
 but I can use it.
 the code and error are below.
 Could you help me what is the problem here please ?

                              <span>I wish to import an allEqual algorithm from APL, particularly (⌈/≡⌊/). This is, to my understanding, the same as a liftM2 (phi combinator) used on the dyadic equals along with two monadic functions max and min.
 Essentially I am wondering what max and min are in Haskell, so that i can do max [1,2,3] &#x3D;&gt; 3.
 I thought this was maximum and minimum in Haskell, after having looked around a little. But attempting to implement my solution doesn&#x27;t work:
 allEqual [Int] -&gt; Bool allEqual [] &#x3D; True allEqual xs &#x3D; liftM2 (&#x3D;&#x3D;) maximum minimum

                              <span>Hi All,
 base32-0.3 is out now, with extended support for GHCs 8.10 thru 9.6, as well as a text and bytestring min version bump. 
 This will be the last in the 0.x series for this library. base32, along withbase16 and base64, are nearing the release of a new epoch 1.x version cycle. In addition to various reworkings of the core apis for all of the base encoding libraries will come a focus on newtyped inputs and outputs, allowing for encode/decode, as well as support for SIMD-enabled loops for architectures that support it. 
 Cheers, Emily

 Are there advantages to doing this over using a Markdown-based note taking system such as Obsidian or Joplin?
 What iOS mobile options are there for this Org Mode mote taking? I&#x27;ve used BeOrg and it seems to be TODO list focused.

 How do org-mode/org-roam peeps integrate Slack with their systems and remain GTD productive? 
 The Longer Tale
 Perhaps more a general r/emacs question than org-mode but I&#x27;m very curious how people use org-mode and Slack together, particularly in terms of capturing TODOS and generally being productive and relating things back to source material. 
 In general, I find Slack turns my highly efficient, inbox-zero, mail-based, David-Allen-esque GTD system to swiss cheese by creating about 200 &quot;inboxes&quot;, so I&quot;m kinda wondering what other org-mode-ians do, and what the mu4e equivalent might be to Slack vs mail (to be clear, I use gmail&#x27;s web interface even for mail, but lean into org-mode to manage notes and TODOs). 
 Would love to hear what&#x27;s working for people vs not. (rather than us all griping about Slack... &#x3D;] I&#x27;m not a fan of the tool, but feel most of its problems are around the way people use it, rather than the tool itself — despite the discourse and twist folks trying to convince me to give those a go at my company. &#x3D;] ).

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m playing around with my emacs config.Using use-package lazy loading options I settled down to ~0.4 s startup time with ~120 packages.Is possible to get even lower?
 At the moment evil and projectile are taking up 0.050 s, can I maybe shave down from projectile?
 I&#x27;m doing this just for fun, 0.4 s is already ultra fast enough, with emacsclient I get as low as 0.35 s ish
 This is my emacs config: https://github.com/Stefanomarton/DotFiles/tree/master/.config/emacs, maybe could be useful to someone.
 Thanks to anyone suggesting something 
 EDIT: maybe there is a specific order in which load stuff?

                              <span>I like Outshine, but it&#x27;s always been buggy, and after a system upgrade to Ubuntu 23.04 (with Emacs 28.2), it hasn&#x27;t really been working at all, even with the latest Outshine from MELPA. outshine-cycle-buffer prints the expected messages in the minibuffer, but has no apparent effect on the buffer contents. Looking at the GitHub issues, I think the package isn&#x27;t getting the TLC it needs.
 I&#x27;m not eager to try fixing Outshine myself, so what would you suggest as alternative approaches for code folding or navigating large files? I have low vision, so I use big fonts, so I don&#x27;t have many lines of code on screen at once, generally about 20.

 VSCode hilighting
 Any idea on how to fix this and get complete VSCode like hilighting? If you notice here &#x60;isLoading&#x60; and &#x60;setIsLoading&#x60; are also different because one is a variable and other is a function. I guess VScode knows this because of semantic hilighting from lsp? 
 I guess eglot doesn&#x27;t support it yet: https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/pull/839
 But I thought atleast typescript would be smart enough to highlight &#x60;setError&#x60; correctly to pink in the emacs case.

                              <span>I use default key bindings and meow, on Japanese keyboard with the help of key re-mapper called keyd for linux, and sharpkeys for windows. Here are the reasons.
 - Emacs default key bindings are the ones that are also used in other programs, like terminal. Getting used to text-operation stuff (like C-a/M-f) to some extent makes consistency.
 - I use Japanese keyboard on desktop and laptop so that I can remap , 
, and  key (they are on my thumbs position) to control, shift, and escape key. I want my keyboard layout to be the same on desktop and laptop, so thumb clusters keyboards are not my choice.
 - I use meow for modal editing. I&#x27;ve used evil, but I didn&#x27;t like to configure evil key bindings for every different mode. I also didn&#x27;t like to disable evil completely for some modes. I just wanted to use j/k and J/K (I map J/K to scroll up/down faster) in certain modes like magit, that do not require much text editing. The thing I like the most about meow is its motion mode. In motion mode, I can use j/k and J/K to scroll, and if I wanted to dispatch keys that are bound in major-mode maps, I can simply prefix them with SPC key (the default is Hyper key, I changed it). In magit for example, I can dispatch k (magit-discard) by pressing SPC-k. Any keys that are not in motion mode map follow the major mode map. I do not use meow keypad because I&#x27;m comfortable with pressing control key. But for those who are not, meow keypad might be good.
 ​
 What do you think? I see a key bindings discussion occasionally here so hope this helps.
 I would very appreciate your suggestion.

                              <span>I was thinking of something similar to OS file managers, where you can right-click a file and have operations relevant to the extension pop up. For example, if I could hover over a file in Dired and have something like a org-capture template menu of categories/operations pop up according to the files extension. I was thinking of how useful this would be for being able to define commands for file compression or (extension-specific) conversion in a config.
 Alternatively if anyone knows of a method to could accomplish something similar to this would be appreciated, I&#x27;d just be interested in having a good way to run common commands on files from Emacs.

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 I&#x27;m relatively new to Emacs and I&#x27;m trying to figure out which text-inputting framework I should use. I&#x27;ve never used Vim before, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will. I have a keyboard with thumb clusters, which eliminates the issue of the &quot;Emacs pinky&quot; entirely. In fact, I find myself preferring chorded commands because they make me feel like a Jedi, with my keyboard as a lightsaber of sorts. It all started with cut/copy/paste when I was a child, and Emacs&#x27; style of running commands feels more like magical sorcery to me.
 Moreover, I use a different keyboard layout than the standard &quot;QWERTY,&quot; so the default movement keys in Vim (&quot;HJKL&quot;) are less convenient for me.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that switching between insert and normal mode in Evil Mode throws me off a bit, but maybe I just need to get used to it. I often hear people say that Evil Mode is a superior way to edit text compared to the default Emacs keybindings. However, I wonder if this preference is mostly driven by those who started with Vim and are already used to modal editing.
 I&#x27;m curious to hear your thoughts. In your opinion, what makes modal editing either superior/inferior? I&#x27;m particularly interested in hearing from those who have switched from Emacs to Vim (lol), especially if they inadvertently got used to Emacs keybindings first.
 Looking forward to your insights!

                              <span>Both corfu and cape READMEs suggests using advices to solve pcmpl-args issues when completing in eshell, I think one of these issues is variable completion like described on https://github.com/JonWaltman/pcmpl-args.el/issues/22#issue-1112526220 (or not? please correct me if i&#x27;m thinking wrong). But I don&#x27;t see any changes, the behavior is the same before and after loading the advices.
 My config is: elisp (use-package pcmpl-args :after eshell :demand nil :config (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-purify)) 
 Which expands to: elisp (eval-after-load &#x27;eshell &#x27;(progn (require &#x27;pcmpl-args nil nil) (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-purify) t))) 
 cape is loaded with emacs initalization so I think it&#x27;s irelevant, but here is anyway: elisp (use-package cape :defer 1 :config (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions &#x27;cape-file)) 
 (I tried to open this issue on both cape and corfu repos but github blocked me and I don&#x27;t know why)

 I did not assess the quality of their material (although I heard good things about their Rust track) but, in all cases, I&#x27;m thinking it could be a good way for people not familiar with Emacs Lisp to start tweaking their editor. :-)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m using dirvish for browsing folders and appreciate the plain text preview feature. 
 It is working surprisingly well even for office documents with the help of some external libraries (pandoc, pdftotext, etc...) : https://i.imgur.com/ZET3dWt.png 
 and ability to register your own dirvish-preview-dispatchers. 
 Example with docx file : 
  ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for docx files (dirvish-define-preview docx (file ext) &quot;Preview docx files in plain text Require: &#x60;pandoc&#x27; (executable)&quot; :require (&quot;pandoc&quot; ) (cond ((equal ext &quot;docx&quot;) &#x60;(shell . (&quot;pandoc&quot; &quot;-t&quot; &quot;plain&quot;,file))))) (add-to-list &#x27;dirvish-preview-dispatchers &#x27;docx) 
 I&#x27;m however struggling with pptx extension as I need to chain execution of 2 commands : 
  
pptx2md for converting PPTX to markup files 
 pandoc for markup files to plain text. 
  
I&#x27;ve tried to use &quot; &amp;&amp; &quot; like this : 
 ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for PPTX files (dirvish-define-preview pptx (file ext) &quot;Preview PPTX files in plain text Require: &#x60;pptx2md&#x27; &amp; &#x60;pandoc&#x27; (executables)&quot; :require (&quot;pptx2md&quot;) :require (&quot;pandoc&quot;) (cond ((equal ext &quot;pptx&quot;) &#x60;(shell . (&quot;pptx2md&quot;, &quot;--disable-image&quot;,file,&quot;&amp;&amp; pandoc&quot;,&quot;-f&quot;,&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;-&gt;t&quot;,&quot;plain&quot;,&quot;out.md&quot;)))) ) (add-to-list &#x27;dirvish-preview-dispatchers &#x27;pptx) 
 but end up with this output in my buffer : 
 usage: pptx2md [-h] [-t TITLE] [-o OUTPUT] [-i IMAGE_DIR] [--image-width IMAGE_WIDTH] [--disable-image] [--disable-wmf] [--disable-color] [--disable-escaping] [--wiki] [--mdk] [--min-block-size MIN_BLOCK_SIZE] pptx_path pptx2md: error: unrecognized arguments: &amp;&amp; pandoc -f markdown out.md 
 I understand why I have this issue, and think it will be possible to fix it by creating my own shell script mixing both commands, but would like to know what is proper way to handle this in elisp. 
 Any ideas ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working on an emacs configuration for myself. I&#x27;m coming from NeoVim and VSCode and both of those have a pretty easy way to fuzzy search for files in the current directory. VSCode has this built in and NeoVim can do this through telescope.
 It feels like there isn&#x27;t a &quot;simple&quot; solution to this in emacs. find-file more or less requires me to type the path. Yes you get tab completion, but that&#x27;s still pretty slow in comparison. And beyond that i seem to get into selectrum, orderless, marginalia and what not, which for one doesn&#x27;t seem to solve this problem either, and feels needlessly complex for what i&#x27;m trying to do.
 So, my workflow has always been that i open my editor in my main projects directory. When i want to open a file, i press a hotkey and start searching with file and folder names. In 99.99% of cases i know exactly how the file is named and where it&#x27;s located. I just don&#x27;t want to have to type out the path. I&#x27;d rather type the parts of the path that are unique and get there quickly.
 What&#x27;s the simplest solution for this? All i really need is a wrapper around fzf. fzf.el would do what i need, but doesn&#x27;t work on windows. There is a fork of fzf.el that &quot;should&quot; fix that but i can&#x27;t get it to work. I&#x27;m also not too sure how to point use-package to a random git repository rather than what&#x27;s on melpa.

                              <span>So i&#x27;ve tried going trough the haskell version of the LLVM kaleidoscope tutorial for haskell. But i quickly faced an issue which is that LLVM-hs fails to compile which is due to the fact that the project requires llvm-4.0 which is really outdated and i can&#x27;t really build it or install it trough my package manager i know that LLVM-hs supports LLVM-9.0 but that is also too old. So is there some workaround to this or should i just pick a different language for my compiler (Which would be sad since i really like haskell).

                              <span>I am working on a parser that converts text to tokens (tokenizer). I would like the type system to check that there is a parser, combined with Alternative, is provided for every token. Is there a way to easily do this?
 I have tried a type-list but it seems to be exponential in compile time and space with respect to the number of token constructors.

                              <span>The new 3.3.0 release of Scala introduced an interesting new syntactic feature (first proposed in SIP-44 - FEWER BRACES).
 I had some fun implementing a Scala version of Python&#x27;s with statement :
 Python version:
 with open(filename) as f: content &#x3D; f.readlines() for line in content: print(line) 
 Scala version:
 with_ (open(filename)): f &#x3D;&gt; val content &#x3D; f.readLines() content.foreach: println(_) 
 Behind the scenes:
 def with_[A](expression: A)(suite: A &#x3D;&gt; Unit): Unit &#x3D; val manager &#x3D; expression val enter &#x3D; try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(&quot;__enter__&quot;) catch _ &#x3D;&gt; null val exit &#x3D; try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(&quot;__exit__&quot;) catch _ &#x3D;&gt; null val value &#x3D; if enter !&#x3D; null then enter.invoke(manager).asInstanceOf[A] else manager try suite(value) catch case e: Exception &#x3D;&gt; println(e) finally if exit !&#x3D; null then exit.invoke(manager) 
 My implementation is obviously highly inspired by Python&#x27;s. For example, by defining a simple file I/O wrapper with __enter__ and __exit__ methods we can nicely and properly handle file reading and writting.
 Let me know what you think and if you have other ideas!

                              <span>I’ve heard about scala for some time now and it seems really interesting. I want to learn and I’m not really sure how to get started and which framework library to learn.
 For context I work as a web developer with node (with express), react and vue. 
 Most job postings I see usually mention http4s and specifically mention having experience with libraries other than Play is a plus. Would learning http4s would be a good idea, from what I understand it’s more fp and the only fp knowledge I have is from an university course in Clisp.
 I would appreciate any recommendations.

 What companies do you know with interesting Scala-based tech stack?

For many decades editors have been unable to do simple things. Like correctly color variables. That is until now. Emacs 29 treesit is here. It is going to enable so many new features.
  
paredit/lispy edits for all languages? check!
 highlight thing at point, in a scope sensitive way? check!
 sticky scroll? check!
 Syntax highlighting that actually works right? check!
  
4 decades of being unable to add color to variables has passed. Programmers have been born, lived, and retired all under that era. This is all about to change. These insurmountable problems are about to become EASY to solve. YOU can implement the features that were impossibly hard for the previous generation. YOU can implement an object-at-point highlighter that is more performant and correct than ever. All you need to know is how to walk a tree.
 Trees are really what enable lisp&#x27;s special powers. Lisp&#x27;s tree nature is what made it possible to easily make advanced modes like paredit. Now everyone is about to have their tree exposed to package developers, not just lisp. The other languages always had a tree, it was just hidden. Adding treesitter to Emacs is more than just another feature. It is lisp-esque. It will pave the way to true editing features.

 The remote host is running Ubuntu 20.04 and my local host is MacOS Ventura 13.3.1.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a complete Emacs newbie and recently decided to take the plunge on my macOS system. As a beginner, I find the learning curve a bit steep, especially when it comes to customizing my setup.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to set up Doom Emacs with a configuration from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/slano-ls/Doom-Emacs-Config and ran into some issues.
 Firstly, the installation process was a bit challenging. I followed the steps to clone both Doom Emacs and the configuration repository, but I&#x27;ve been encountering errors saying that Emacs cannot find my config.el file. I did ensure that the file exists in the appropriate directory, though.
 Secondly, I&#x27;ve had trouble with having Emacs recognized in my $PATH. I installed Emacs using Homebrew and attempted to add it to my $PATH, but the Doom installation script keeps telling me that it can&#x27;t run Emacs.
 To summarize, I&#x27;ve got two main issues:
  
Emacs/Doom Emacs can&#x27;t seem to find my config.el file.
 Having trouble getting Emacs to be recognized in my $PATH.
  
I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide some guidance, tips, or resources to help me sort these issues out and get more comfortable with Emacs on macOS. I&#x27;ve been searching and trying out solutions, but as a beginner, it&#x27;s been quite overwhelming.
 Thanks in advance!
 P.S. If there&#x27;s any additional information you need, please let me know. I&#x27;m keen to learn and make this work!

                              <span>I have started a mooc which uses Emacs. I have only previously used Dr.Racket and Anaconda so I&#x27;m having trouble with how I actually run programs in Emacs.
 I did the tutorial which covers how to edit and navigate text, open and save files.
 I just don&#x27;t understand how you actually write some code and run it?
 In Dr.Racket or Anaconda, I could write some function in say python, that asks user for two numbers, and returns their sum. I&#x27;d write the code, click run, it would prompt me for the two numbers, I&#x27;d enter them and it would return their sum.
 Can anyone explain how I would do this in Emacs? I understand it&#x27;s more powerful text editor I just really can&#x27;t see how to do something simple like the above. I would like to learn how to use Emacs, and the course videos are all done using Emacs so ideally I&#x27;d like to be able to follow along with the videos.
 So yea if someone could explain how I could do what I know how to do in Anaconda, just write a simple function, run it and interact with it, then get a return. I think it might really help me understand the difference between Emacs and Anaconda etc. All the tutorials just talk about editing text. Not writing code, running it and giving it input and seeing the output? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something very obvious but just struggling to see how you go from the text editing to actually running code I have written?

 It&#x27;s better than nothing, but one doesn&#x27;t go the emacs route for &quot;better than nothing&quot;. It&#x27;s not showing symbols. E.g. vscode shows symbols:

 lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-icons-enable is already set to t if someone is going to suggest that.

                              <span>Dear fellow emacsers.
 Given a csv file with columns A, B, C; and rows 1, 2, 3... how do I turn that into a tree, walking it column first?
 So ~~~ | | A | B | C | | 1 | | | | | 2 | | | | | 3 | | | | ~~~
 becomes: ~~~ A *1 *2 *3 B *1 *2 *3 C *1 *2 *3 ~~~
 I saw &quot;GitHub - emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table: Transform org-mode tree with properties to a table, and the other way around&quot; (https://github.com/emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table) but it works on properties, not the cell value...
 I&#x27;m sure there is something there (and of course 1st I searched on emacs itself), but can&#x27;t find it... I must be using wrong keywords.
 Thanks a ton. :)

                              <span>I use auctex to work with TeX files, and one of the features I really like is the ability to go from the tex code to the corresponding location in the pdf and viceversa. I wanted to switch to org mode so I can use its links features, org-roam, and the source blocks, but at the end of the day I want to output a pdf and be able to go from the pdf to the org file as I did with auctex. I found some discussion on this by searching for org-mode with synctex, but the most recent attention this problem got in the mailing list was from 2010. Have there been any updates?

                              <span>Because tree sitter is making a nice opportunity for us to evolve Emacs bindings, I have been pulling together some POC work into a package called user-keys.
 So far it&#x27;s useful for Elisp programmers. I&#x27;m undecided about whether or how to take it to the next level for users. The state of progress:
  
reports and extensible tools for keymap analysis 
 shadows (every single map that binds C-n for example)
 &quot;stupid keys&quot; that you want to delete everywhere
 preferred bindings state
 
 macro proof of concept for abstract key bindings, an idea I&#x27;ve pushed on emacs devel to make ad-hoc conventions like C-n configurable to the user
 lots of groundwork for mass rebinding or unbinding
  
some of the kinds or report generation I created earlier.
 I was going to spike the code and use it as a demonstration for writing a transient UI, but I&#x27;m a little unclear on where to deliver the most value. I&#x27;m not super committed to this package, but felt it had too much utility already to keep it to myself.
 I&#x27;m interested in feature requests, hopes and dreams, (and support for the package or other packages I&#x27;m working on).
 I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of value out of the elisp repo kit (erk) and was able to use a normal TDD style like a civilized person, really making things go faster. I also got some more experience with the dash library and of course immense exposure to the weirdness of Emacs keymap data.

                              <span>I messed up trying to install some paths in emacs for OS Monterey while following a guide to set emacs, deleted some paths and don&#x27;t remember what they were.
 So I want to just completely uninstall emacs and start over again.
 How ever when I run &quot;brew remove emacs&quot;
 i get the error &quot;Error: cask &quot;emacs&quot; is not installed&quot;
 I have been using it and went through the tutorial so I really don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t uninstall? I&#x27;m completely new to using command line and emacs so I dont even know where to begin. I tried to just remove it from applications folder but there is still several associated files when I search emacs.
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to understand what this error means and how to completely uninstall emacs and all the associated files. Can anyone please explain why I&#x27;m getting this error after I had been succesfully running emacs? surely everything must have been there to be able to open and complete the tutorial?

                              <span>Hi, I am looking for a function in emacs, but no idea how it is called.
 This function exists in logseq under the name Macros.
 For instance, when I enter Trac-2345, logseq knows that it must be replaced by a link to the ticket number 2345 in my Trac ticket system.
 How is it called in emacs and how shall I implement it?
 Thanks for sharing!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using Wanderlust for years, and just now I discovered this issue/problem:
  
I am using Wanderlust (v. 2.15.9) on my main machine and it works just perfect.
 
I am using rsync to &quot;clone&quot; literally whole home folder on my laptop, when I am going on the roads. So I have the same behaviour, messages, notes… in (on) my laptop.
 
Wanderlust (and Emacs of course) works fine, except:
 
I can not delete message(s) from remote (POP) folder, after marking with d and pressing x I get a error message &quot;1 execution(s) were failed&quot; (or more than 1, depends on Nr. of marked messages).
 
 What can be a reason of this?
 Note: I can delete messages from local folders (stored on HDD).
 All the settings like .wl, .folders… are the same.
 Does anybody has any idea how to solve this (actually I can still delete messages from webmail or telnet, this is not a problem, but it&#x27;s little-bit annoying)?
 Thanks in advance

 I use org-change-tag-in-region a lot in my daily routine. I love it because I can set or unset tags in a huge block of stuff. However, what bugs me is this: When I mark a region to tag/untag all the selected items, it will unmark the items after I set or remove a tag. Is there a way to keep the selection on the text so I don&#x27;t have to mark it all over again to set/unset more tags?
 ty!

 I remember it was a very ambitious project.

                              <span>I recently built emacs from source. I am getting these weird symbols all over the place. It looks like it is failing to display small image files. I have this issue building from the tip of the github tree and emacs-29.0.91.
 The build has gif, jpeg, png, xpm, rsvg2 all enabled. 
 This is happening on Centos-8 and LinuxMint-21.
 Any ideas on what I am missing?

                              <span>Hello!
I am a Bookends user, and I have a nice collection of PDFs associated with references. I was able to dump the references into a *.bibtex file and import it into bibdesk, but I don&#x27;t know how I can attach those PDFs to references in BibDesk. Does someone here know?
Also, bookends supports what they call, I think, &quot;floating citations&quot;, where pressing alt-alt in The Archive brings up a small window where I can search a reference and it pastes, for example, [@Smith1976] into the Archive. This too I&#x27;d love to replicate, but if not available, I can script it easily enough using an unholy mix of Python and Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.
Why I want to switch: Bookends isn&#x27;t very git-friendly; they produce a binary file containing the references instead of a text file like bibtex.
Many thanks!</span>

                              <span>Hello all.
 I am new to emacs and Org Mode. But I&#x27;m looking to step up my personal notes game and move away from proprietary systems.
 My hope is to use Spacemacs on my various computer and beorg on my phone and iPad to give me a good note and &#x27;second brain&#x27; system.
 This is probably a real simple question, but I have only been at this since yesterday...
 Is there a way to scape a web page into Org format and include it in my notes? Or possiblt just scrape paert of a web page and convert it into org mode.

                              <span>In November 2022, Tweag engineers merged a WebAssembly back end into
the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC).
The back end includes a new translation for control flow, which enables GHC to avoid depending on external tools like Binaryen.
Because the translation is new, we wanted to test it before submitting a merge request.
And classic unit testing was not a good fit—we would have needed to know what
the WebAssembly code was
expected to be generated from any given fragment of Haskell,
and that’s a job for a compiler, not an engineer.
Fortunately, we don’t care
how generated code is written; we care about how it behaves.
Code’s behavior can be tested by running it, but we wanted to test the translation before integrating it with GHC. So we
simulated translated code by tracing possible
executions…</span>

 I&#x27;d like all the stars except the right-most one to have a specific face. The face should apply on top of the already applied &quot;org-level-x&quot; face.

 How can I achieve this? I&#x27;m reading the elisp manual for font-lock but I really can&#x27;t wrap my head around it.

                              <span>I used to be a VSCode user. I&#x27;m a programmer and make my living doing web development these days. Last year I decided I wanted to give Emacs a try. I went for Doom Emacs with the intent of someday making my own config. I used it for a good 6 months at least and fell in love with Emacs. I also decided I wanted to give neovim a fair try. 
 I made a neovim config from scratch. It took me 2 days but I got a really good config which does almost everything I want and I use that as my daily editor for my work without any problems. 
 After I made my neovim config I decided I wanted to make my own Emacs config from scratch and started on tha endeavor. I am so heartbroken to say that after having sunk more than a month into it, having read the 300 pages of the book &quot;Mastering Emacs&quot; by Mickey Peterson, I&#x27;m nowhere close to done. Nothing seems to work like it should. Adding a new packages breaks the functionality of the old ones for whatever reason. 
 I upgraded from emacs 28 to 29 and lsp that worked about fine on my config now doesn&#x27;t work. Company mode seems broken as well. I really want to love Emacs and I&#x27;ve been at it for months now. It&#x27;s starting to seem like a fool&#x27;s errand at this point. 
 after spending almost a year between neovim and emacs, it&#x27;s starting to feel like VSCode wasn&#x27;t all that bad. It did almost everything I wanted from it and I didn&#x27;t have to feel like I was fighting against the very tool that&#x27;s supposed to make me productive.

                              <span>I’ve seen many folks say emacs is great for literate programming, but I wonder what industries use such a thing.
 Is it mostly a tool for data science and scientific computing?
 I was thinking of using org to take notes on and build a knowledge base for tech stuff I’m learning about, and integrated code blocks seem like a good thing for that.

 I actually do not understand how these stuff work, but I assume the big performance leap from this fishbowl performance benchmark.

 So looks like I can only write a few words when using magit commit.
 Is there any option to increase the max commit message in magit?

                              <span>I know this is a shot in the dark and most will probably think that this is a silly proposal, but I figure why not ask?
 Does anyone think that we should have an official Emacs emoji? You can apply for one for free: https://emojipedia.org/proposals/#:~:text&#x3D;Anyone%20can%20submit%20a%20proposal,and%20cannot%20already%20be%20represented.
 Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking:
  
Emacs people don&#x27;t use Emojis
  
A: Well, some of us *do* use them. A lot. Even inside of Emacs.
  
They&#x27;re not going to give it for a piece of software
  
A: Well, Emacs isn&#x27;t just a piece of software. It&#x27;s seen as a philosophy by most people who even know what it is. So maybe we can apply for it under that banner?
 I know the chances of it being approved would be slim but it *is* kind of unique and it *is* a philosophy to many people. So maybe?
 Again: I&#x27;m not expecting a huge response but I figured maybe some here might agree and try anyway?
 Thanks for reading. 🙃

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve been using LanguageTool since 2019 because it&#x27;s open source and has some level of Emacs integration, but I&#x27;m not happy with it anymore as it lets some critical grammar mistakes slide. For instance, LanguageTool couldn&#x27;t detect the two grammar issues here, while Grammarly was able to:
 &quot;I’m in a plane. I thought classes today.&quot; 
 I&#x27;m used to writing markdowns on Emacs, but I don&#x27;t think my setup is adequate anymore.

                              <span>Customize is great, but sometimes it&#x27;s not possible to use it. For example eglot-server-programs is definitely something you&#x27;d maybe want to customize, but it&#x27;s a defvar, which as far as I can tell is impossible to use with customize-set-variable. Same with treesit-language-source-alist. Am I missing something?

 When I edit a list in a org file, the newline starts at @.

 Why are they different. Is there a way to get org-mode indenting to behave like in markdown?

                              <span>I recently picked up learning touch typing to increase my typing speed. I’m also slowing moving my digital life into emacs. I presently use vanilla emacs with default bindings. Just mapped the caps key to control key.
 My rudimentary search in this sub confused me if learning qwerty touch typing makes sense if I use emacs a lot. I realised there are other layouts such as Dvorak which might be more suitable.
 Need suggestions on how to figure out which layout I need to learn?

I tried doing C-s a few times with a string, which works fine, but then the tutorial says to press  a few times, and that it should either move back an occurrence or remove a char from the search string. Mine just deleted the character in front of the cursor. I had this happening in fundamental and text mode, why?

 In this episode, Edsko will give a user&#x27;s perspective on falsify, his new library for property based testing in Haskell, inspired by the Hypothesis library for Python. This episode will be suitable for beginners. 
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. You can use the link above to get to the playlist and watch the other episodes.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes: https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src&#x3D;c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )

                              <span>Hello! 
I adopted a Plain Text workflow a few years ago. I am on Linux/Windows environments. I&#x27;m not tied to any editor (hence my use of markdown). I use various VIM flavors, VS Code, notepad, and have tried emacs, Zettlr and Obsidian. I&#x27;m fairly comfortable using any of those but am mainly using Zettlr right now. I use pandoc to generate most everything I need either to HTML, docx or PDF via LaTeX. My reference manager of choice is Zotero. I use hypothes.is &quot;somewhat,&quot; but not much. I haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to just pipe those notes into Zotero where I&#x27;d prefer them. My &quot;inbox&quot; is Zotero.
Why am I looking at Zettelkasten after all these years? Because I&#x27;m adventuring out into new phases in my life where I think notetaking and writing are going to become far more important. Mainly in the area of Genealogy. Genealogy has overlap with many topics/cross-overs in history, anthropology, social sciences, archive/library science, DNA, general research, writing. I need a better way to process and use information. While I have degrees in history, anthropology, and engineering, I&#x27;ve work in more practical fields, mainly Tech, for years and am well out of practice in research and writing.
Since I haven&#x27;t seriously written or researched in years, I need to shake the rust off. As part of that effort, I want better techniques to process and store what I&#x27;ve read. I think the &quot;commonplace&quot; tradition (and I fit Zettelkasten in that category for this discussion) is the only methodology that seriously considers the process of taking notes and tying them together. There is, I believe, a fairly complete workflow from figuring out what to read, how to read it, how to take notes about it, how to process those notes (including storage), how to tie notes together, and how to use them for output.
Also, it seems to be the most amenable method to fit into my plain text workflow.
I do have more specific questions, mainly around my notes in Zotero and what to do with them, but I will post them separately.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been watching a growing number of teachers, professors, and researchers who have been transferring their personal note taking, zettelkasten, or personal knowledge management practices into the classroom for students from 6th or 7th grade up into college/university level. As it&#x27;s been a while since this practice was more commonplace (excuse the pun), perhaps it could be useful (and fun) to do a meetup or mini-unconference on the topic to discuss some ideas, practices, and pedagogy?
Format
Depending on everyone&#x27;s general availability, we could do something on a quiet day over the summer break? I&#x27;m thinking something in the 2-4 hour range depending on the level of interest and what folks think would be most productive. At the lower end we could do a few hours as a simple meetup/discussio…</span>

                              <span>Ever since I started using emacs I&#x27;ve progressively moved a lot of my work into emacs, as I suppose is the case for many of you. As such, I devised various workflows, which include creating reproducible org documents, custom LaTeX exports, capturing things to my agenda and to my org-roam Zettelkasten, etc. After a while, I&#x27;ve felt the need to start writing small guides to myself to remind me how I achieved several things which I do frequently but not often enough that I would remember. Do you find yourselves also doing this? Writing little short descriptions on how to do things? If you do, I&#x27;m curious to know what kind of strategy you use for this.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up certain interactions between my window manager (Hyprland) and Emacs, and for various reasons just matching window titles is no longer sufficient. Specifically, I need the minibuffer frame to have a wm_class other than emacs.
 Setting the title is just  (add-to-list &#x27;minibuffer-frame-alist &#x27;(title . &quot;uniquename&quot;)) 
 However this doesn&#x27;t change the class, nor does there appear to be a class frame parameter. Parameters I have tried that don&#x27;t work: class, name, role, instance, x-class, wm-class. 
 I&#x27;ve looked thru the manual and did not find anything related to the Class of frames, only titles and internal parameters.
 It appears from https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/60168/how-can-i-set-wm-class-for-emacs-27 and the bug report linked therein that name used to do this but no longer does because of GTK or something.
 I&#x27;d prefer not to rely on Emacsclient as that interferes with other things.
 What are we supposed to do in this case?

                              <span>So a minor thing, but I took the jump to emacs 29 to start updating configs and such, and was moderately dismayed to note that pretty-mode is somehow not working... most of the time.
 And I&#x27;m not sure how to diagnose. I had followed the (older) base instructions from Mastering Emacs (http://www.modernemacs.com/post/prettify-mode/), with &#x60;(pretty-activate-groups &#x27;(sub-and-superscripts :greek :arithmetic-nary))&#x60; and a set of &#x60;prettify-symbols-alist&#x60; pairs for Python. 
 ...the prettify-symbols-alist pairs work (but look different...sometimes)
 ...the ligatures work...
 ...but greek symbols are nowhere to be found (seemingly in python-mode and python-ts-mode). It&#x27;s a minor thing, but since there&#x27;s a lot of mathematical programming involved, I rather miss it. I don&#x27;t see any error messages in *Messages* but I&#x27;m not sure what I would be looking for.
 Any suggestions? I feel appropriately foolish...

                              <span>Hi! I would like to prevent completions from being suggested to the empty string in inferior-python-mode. 
 To explain a bit better - when the prompt or the string is empty, there are no completions proposed. When I type something, say &quot;a&quot;, I get a number of completions (such as abs, all, any, etc.). 
 If I backspace and get back to the empty string, instead of just getting back to a normal cursor, I get empty string completions such as &quot;%%!&quot;, &quot;%%HTML&quot; and more irrelevant options of the sort. My completion-at-point-functions are (python-shell-completion-at-point comint-completion-at-point t) I&#x27;m using spacemacs with the basic python layer and not too many changes (using ipython as my REPL, with python-shell-completion-native-enable set to true). I hope this might be enough information already to suggest a solution.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done lots of research on this one, lots of references to mobile org which is no longer in the play store, I see orgzly but don&#x27;t see an integrated sync solution. There is org-mobile-pull/push. And then there is the dropbox crew...
 TL;DR: I&#x27;m thinking of setting up a dropbox to copy my daily plan.org file to, so I can keep in check on the go. I&#x27;d need a mobile capture file as well and then I&#x27;d manually parse that into my org system at home when convenient. Intuition says doomed to fail, but I&#x27;d love to hear if anyone has settled on this kind of system, or something better that works robustly.
 (It would be nice to have more access to the rest of the org setup since the items in my plan file tend to be org links to places with notes, followups, tacking info, etc... which would be occasionally nice to have on the go but isn&#x27;t part of the min feature set.)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all help or info. I know this gets asked a lot, but it seems in that deadzone of many half baked solutions that different people sometimes kinda use with apps and libraries that were tried and then have fallen out of favor.

                              <span>I understand that GNU ELPA is the official GNU Emacs package repository and is the only repository enabled by default. I also understand that submitting a package to GNU ELPA is a bit of a hassle and requires an FSF copyright assignment meaning that the official repository has a limited selection of packages.
 Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but a copyright assignment is basically transferring ownership and rights of a specific creative work or works to a third party. So in this case, the third party would be the FSF, right?
 Where as with NonGNU ELPA the FSF doesn&#x27;t ask for copyright assignments for packages meaning they won&#x27;t be able to go into core Emacs? NonGNU ELPA isn&#x27;t enabled by default..? 
 If anyone has a simple, less confusing way of explaining this, please leave a comment. Any feedback is greatly appreciated and I thank you in advance.

                              <span>Edit: added missing info 
 Hi, I am trying to display the ellipsis that shows that the line is larger than the screen, but can&#x27;t find any good solution. What is the name of the variable?
 So far I get this □ character at the right side of the screen for each line, showing that the line is larger than the screen. How to display a proper and nicer symbol?
 Or does it mean that there is a symbol defined, but not supported by the face? (name of the variable?)
 I looked for &quot;ellipsis&quot;... I thought the variable truncate-string-ellipsis was the right one... In my config &quot;...&quot; is defined (and it does work as org-level ellipsis...)
 I am sorry, I am not english and maybe not looking therefore for the right info using the wrong vocabulary...
 Looking for info with  describe-char  did not help...
 Thanks for your support.

Org-autolist redefines list behavior and removes this. I just want to add this back with a specific keybinding. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I have been having a couple of issues w/ the indentation of SRC blocks under lists (picture attached).
 1) I have an underline enabled for my begin line and an overline enabled for my end line. Under a list, these lines extend all the way across the buffer, while instead, I&#x27;d only like them to extend from the current indentation level to the right side of the buffer.
  
The org-modern-indent package does restrict the length of this line, but it adds some extra fontification to my begin/end lines that I do not want (fringe markers, and a small overbar at the beginning of the begin/end line), and I do not know how to remove these.
  
2) The content of the src is always flush left regardless of indentation level. I think this is probably related to me setting org-src-preserve-indentation to t which I did for other issues w/ indentation.
 ​
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix these issues?

                              <span>Hello, after using Roam Research, Logseq and similar applications for a while, I switched to The Archive because of its simple and clean interface. I keep my notes in a file on my computer and synchronize it with Google Drive. My phone is android. How can I access and edit my The Archive notes on Android with Google Drive synchronization without a sync tool that eats battery? What are your suggestions?</span>

                              <span>Hi Zettlers,
I am thinking about buying a dictation device. I don&#x27;t own a smartphone and want to postpone this state of my life as long as possible. However, when I go on walks with my dogs, I have quite some ideas. I am at the pain threshold of finally doing something about it. 
But I don&#x27;t know what to look for.

the next article will cover how to combine BASB and the Zettelkasten Method. It is a longer article that took quite some work, So I&#x27;d like to publish it as beta first.
If you like to take a first look, give me some feedback, and find a typo or two, please request the link and I&#x27;ll send you the link to a google-doc.

                              <span>I’m a second person reconnecting after a few years away from Scala 2.12 (iirc).
 Anyone done any work at implementing an llm in scala/Java or being able to use JNI for one of the c/c++ implementations? Lama.cpp has been a bit complicated to get working for me. I’d prefer a pure Scala implementation. However, I am way out of my comfort zone with some of this.

                              <span>With Nickel releasing 1.0 I’m excited to announce the 0.1 release
of Tf-Ncl, an experimental tool for writing Terraform deployments with
Nickel instead of HCL.
Tf-Ncl enables configurations to be checked against Terraform provider-specific
contracts, before calling Terraform to perform the deployment. Nickel
can natively generate outputs as JSON, YAML or TOML; since Terraform can accept
its deployment configuration as JSON, you can straightforwardly export a Nickel
configuration, adhering to the right format, to Terraform. Tf-Ncl provides
a framework for ensuring a Nickel configuration has this specific format.
Specifically, Tf-Ncl is a tool to generate Nickel contracts that describe the
configuration schema expected by a set of Terraform providers.
This approach means that Terraform doesn…</span>

 Which makes me wonder if there is any way to have async/await behavior in emacs, so that the next function runs only after the buffers are ready:
 (add-hook &#x27;ein:ipynb-mode-hook (lambda () (cl-letf (((symbol-function &#x27;read-directory-name) (lambda (_prompt dir &amp;rest _args) dir))) (ein:process-find-file-callback) (mapc &#x27;switch-to-buffer (cl-remove-if-not (lambda (b) (and (string-match-p &quot;ein&quot; (buffer-name b)) (string-match-p &quot;ipynb&quot; (buffer-name b)))) (buffer-list))) (delete-other-windows) )))

 The first json/ipynb buffer slows down emacs considerably and it&#x27;s only needed to trigger ein-mode to start server - is there any way to stop loading of that first buffer midway to speed startup times?

                              <span>I am running Emacs 28.2 on both my Mac and Linux machine - the configuration is shared mostly, aside from a few pcase conditions.
 On Mac I&#x27;m using the version from emacsforosx.com On Linux I&#x27;m using the package from the Arch repos.
 For some reason, ispell has a keybinding of s-: on the Mac and no binding set on the Linux machine.
 I can confirm that the super key is available for binding on my Linux machine within Emacs.
 Can someone help explain why there is this disparity?

                              <span>Hi,
 This isn&#x27;t an Emacs issue, but an intermittent problem I&#x27;m having with my home wifi. But Emacs has provided the latest clue.
 I was trying to update my packages via M-x package-display-packages. This brings up the list of packages as expected, but when I try to &#x27;update all&#x27; via &#x27;U&#x27;, I get the message &quot;waiting for refresh to finish&quot;. Only it didn&#x27;t, after many minutes, when it usually takes a few seconds.
 This lead to many rabbit holes, until I discovered that the problem happens on my home wifi network, but if I switch to my cellular network (via a phone hotspot), the problem disappears - I can refresh my package list almost instantly.
 This makes me suspect other issues with services hanging when on my home network (but not on my cell data) may be related. 
 So: how does Emacs connect to elpa/melpa/etc? I&#x27;m hoping understanding this better might help me resolve my network issues.
 Other observations:
  
while the package update hung, I could still load webpages, including those for the repositories I use (elpa, melpa)
 
using curl -I to connect to the repositories also worked, even while I couldn&#x27;t refresh the package list.
 
I build Emacs from source, and the problem existed on the previous build yesterday (which was several months old), and the latest build from sources pulled last night.
 
 As I said, not an Emacs issue, but maybe Emacs not being able to contact the repositories is a clue to the network issue?
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks,

                              <span>Do you have any experience with both Eat (https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/eat.html) and vterm (https://melpa.org/#/vterm) ? Do you have any preference between them?
 I&#x27;m finally taking the plunge and switching fully from Windows to Linux. Getting vterm on Windows was too involved to make me switch from my dedicated terminal emulator, but the process seems much more doable on Linux, so I&#x27;ve been considering it.
 However, I&#x27;ve also seen people praise Eat, but it seems like less people are familiar with it. And so I got curious whether people who have used both have a strong preference.
 If so, would you mind sharing a little about why you find one more appealing/ergonomic or why it may be more efficient/powerful than the other?

 Does anyone has an idea what this could be? The file file.py is open in a buffer and I&#x27;m working on it.
 I know about auto-save (#file#) and backup files (file~). But what is .#file about? And why is it symlinked to a server-xyz-thing. Never seen a symlink like this.

  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) &#x27;alpha &#x27;(85 . 50)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(alpha . (85 . 50))) 
 The first line alone works fine. So why do I need the second line? What this this list about?
 The Wiki do not explain it. And the emacs-in-build-help doesn&#x27;t help me either. I don&#x27;t understand it.

 How do I resolve this error?
 I created the calendar.org file in the relevant ~/Dropbox/org section of my config so I think it is something to do with /tmp permissions?
 The programs will allow me to sync both my Google and my Etesyc Contacts and Calendars. Etesync also needs Etesync-Dav installed on the desktop but that is well explained on Github.
 Basically I have Google Calendar because of my iTalki lesson appointments and Airline Flight bookings which automagically appear there. Etesync is for anything else as I want to reduce my dependence on Google.
 ID properties created in file &quot;/tmp/khalel-capture-NajqkZ-tmp.org&quot; Wrote /tmp/khalel-capture-NajqkZ-tmp.ics Buffer calendar.org modified; kill anyway? (y or n) y org-back-to-heading: Directory / write-protected 
 There is no information in the buffer Khalel Errors.
 Yes I am on Doom Emacs but I think this is specific to Khalel or maybe Debian.

I&#x27;m trying to make less and less of these #meta-ZK notes. This is one of two #meta-ZK notes in the last ten days. An improvement over many 10-day time spans, but still two too many.
Bring on the comments. Lossen the bulls!

                              <span>I made a website long ago with org-mode, and kind of used emacs as a static site generator.(Works great for everything except customising the html)
 The config for org-publish is setup in org-publish-project-alist
 currently, it looks something like this 
 (setq org-publish-project-alist &#x27;((&quot;my-project&quot; :base-directory &quot;path/to/source&quot; :publishing-directory &quot;path/to/publish&quot; :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html :html-preamble &quot;ALL the html code in here&quot;))) 
 It&#x27;s getting pretty cumbersome to write html in a string, so is there any way to add an external html file which will get sourced in the location of html-preamble?

 Is there an example configuration somewhere?

                              <span>I am looking for a tool to organize my life and take notes for undergrad engineering studies — which is exactly what org-mode is perfect for. I would prefer to use Neovim instead though. 
 I feel like emacs seems like a walled garden — where I’ll start to feel like everything I do on a computer needs to be done in emacs, as opposed to using a variety of different purpose-built tools together for task management and note taking.
 I could just use: - Markdown and LaTeX plus vimwiki to take notes - Task- and time-warrior for an agenda and to-do list - Ledger for financial management - Various shell or Python scripts to tie things together
 I’ve seen that people switch to emacs entirely for org-mode, however, and I can’t shake the feeling that I should maybe switch over.
 Edit: I definitely used “walled garden” the wrong way here; I meant that I might feel like I have to use emacs to do everything instead of having more flexibility to use other software. I see what y’all mean though, I don’t have to use it for everything if I don’t want.

                              <span>Some years ago, I wrote myself a tool to download financial transactions from my bank and put them into a ledger journal. I found that manually entering the transaction with the hledger interface was too tedious for me.
 The tool uses the german FinTS standard, so the number of supported banks is limited.
 I&#x27;ve now released a new version that is mainly written in Haskell instead of Python. I did that because I noticed that I am much more likely to work on Haskell projects in my free time, simply because it is more fun for me.
 Unfortunately, this complicated the setup process somewhat, as one can no longer just run pip install fints2ledger. I would love to improve this in the future but don&#x27;t really know a better way.
 Code feedback is also appreciated, especially from the perspective of people not too familiar with Haskell.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a student, and I accidentally used the &quot;quick fix&quot; option. however it seemed to be some sort of quick fix that changed the enviroment fully, and I don&#x27;t know how to change it. it was a change of adding &quot;add.splash.string.&quot;... it was something like that, if it can help to have a idea of the category that has been changed.
 The thing is THIS code worked for my teacher, but as for me it doesn&#x27;t! so it made a change about how declare and i can&#x27;t do it right. this is making me difficult to practice for the test.
 I tried to undo, but I closed VSC before, thinking that it&#x27;ll undo itself. however it didn&#x27;t and I can&#x27;t undo it anymore.
 I tried to reinstall VSC... but as you can see, it didn&#x27;t helped neither. all the config stay there.
 what can I do now?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with python lately, and on a few occasions I evaluate variables that end up producing a ton of output (e.g. dumping 1,000 filepaths).
 In my terminal, the output finishes in less than 1 second. In emacs it makes the editor unusable for about 10-20 seconds.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried enabling global-so-long-mode and disabling font locking in the inferior python buffer, which are the solutions I found online, but that is still resulting in unusable performance.
 Has anyone solved this? Two potential solutions I thought of would be either to find a way to truncate output and creating a command to expand it when needed, or to find a way to connect to a remote python repl running in another terminal tab, but I&#x27;m not sure how to do either of those.

                              <span>I have all my config in a single giant org mode file. This file produces three others when tangled, init.el, early-init.el and a custom theme for my colorscheme. Problem is, whenever I make a change in the org file, and tangle the changes, the git repo for my dotfiles now sees two different files being modified (obviously) with the same changes. It makes it really cumbersome to do proper commits, since if I did many changes and I&#x27;d like to do various commits for each of them, I have to add not only the changes in the org file, but also hunt down the same modifications in the init and early-init files (mostly init tho).
 I recently tried to fix this by dropping all of the init.el contents into some other file, call it &quot;real-init.el&quot;. Then, I would have a very minimal init.el that would check if init and early-init exist, and if they don&#x27;t, it would tangle the org file and restart emacs. I would just keep track of the org file and the minimal init file in the git repo, and since the init file is very minimal and wouldn&#x27;t change very often, it would be a fine compromise.
 For some odd reason, while the files did get tangled, emacs would just restart indefinitely. It opened, then closed, then opened, then closed. I had to force kill it.
 Has anyone else faced this problem? How did you solve it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to work with Deno in Emacs. The lsp-mode can easily connect to the lsp-server. However, it is unable to resolve the import maps. For example, can&#x27;t go to definition even though VS Code can easily do that. 
 I&#x27;ve tries setting the lsp-clients-deno-import-map to the impart_map.json file in the project folder, but still that didn&#x27;t work.
 Any suggestions or links to a working configurations that I can have a look at?

 Try opening ipython notebook in vscode. Then try to open ipython notebook via emacs.
 Vscode takes you directly to the rendered buffer ready to edit in less than a second.
 Emacs won&#x27;t work and won&#x27;t tell you how to fix it. You go search for a package - you find ein. You get it installed, you get jupyter package install. Turns out it was the wrong package, so now you get the correct jupyter notebook pacakge installed. It turns out that ein now needs you to separately start the server, open the server, switch to the file that you ALREADY HAD OPENED and then switch to that buffer. It opens five other buffers in the meantime, three of them cluttering your workspace.
 It also crashed twice while getting there...
 I don&#x27;t doubt that it has some great features going (extensibility, minimalism), but for the love of emperor don&#x27;t be an idiot and create sane defaults!
 This is the time where you can&#x27;t pretend anymore and have to admit that vscode extension just did it plain better...

 Currently, I see diagnostics as virtual text.

                              <span>I use org-refile to navigate and file things all the time. While it is functional, I have long craved something a little more flexible.
 So I&#x27;ve written a package that allows you to programmatically set composable shortcuts for org-refile.
 https://github.com/thread314/org-navigator
 It allows the user to set prefix shortcut keys to various actions (refile to, go-to, clock in to etc), and combine these with suffix keys that define the target for the desired action.
 So for example, typing C-c fa might file the current subtree to the subtree set to &quot;a&quot;, whereas C-c ia would instead jump to that subtree and open it in an indirect buffer.
 It also allows the user to define the destination suffix keys by setting a property on the target subtree itself from within the org-mode file.
 I&#x27;m not a programmer so always very open to any feedback or suggestions.

 I&#x27;ve set this at the first line of the remote .zshrc in the case of MacOS:
 [[ $TERM &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;dumb&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; unsetopt zle &amp;&amp; PS1&#x3D;&#x27;$ &#x27; &amp;&amp; return 
 At least connect does not just hang, but it shows this (testing connecting to localhost):
 /ssh:USER@localhost:/Users/USER:

 The value of dired-listing-switches is &quot;-al&quot;.

 Anything to try here? I&#x27;ve tried starting up Emacs with -Q to rule out any local config. The Emacs I&#x27;m using is on MacOS and version is:

                              <span>Hi, first post here. I have a noob question arround Org Babel. I want to generate an error for didactic purposes on a Java code. There is a way to evaluate the SRC code block and output the error message? Currently the code executes, stdout the expected errors in another buffer but don&#x27;t show the errors in the results section. Here is my code:
 #+begin_src java float a &#x3D; 3; float b &#x3D; 2; float div &#x3D; a / b; int sum &#x3D; a + b; int mult &#x3D; a * b; int subt &#x3D; a - b; System.out.println(&quot;Sum: &quot; + sum + &quot; || Sub: &quot; + subt + &quot; || Mult: &quot; + mult + &quot; || Div: &quot; + div); #+end_src 
 The idea is to show the type error under the #+RESULTS:Section

 since, captionpos&#x3D;b is adding itself at last, its overriding my value captionpos&#x3D;t. I looked into ox-latex and I found this:
 &#x60;((&quot;captionpos&quot; ,(if caption-above-p &quot;t&quot; &quot;b&quot;))). 
 I do not understand caption-above-p, how is it assigned?
 How can I stop adding captionpos&#x3D;b or make it &#x3D;t?
 Note: I am using Doom Emacs.
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>I have been learning about tagless final. I prepared a simple usecase to just create user in a repository. I started with example based tests and also tried with property based testing. Had some doubts and got it clarified in stackoverflow. My intention was to have a defined set of rules for the UserAlgebra. Since the interpreters are expected to follow the same rules, it would be easier to develop. Usually, I start with an InmemoryInterpreter implementation. Later another interpreter would be implemented for the real persistence based repository. 
 Slowly, I got pulled in cats-laws &amp;&amp; disciple with scalacheck until I ran into a considerably long phase that I dont understand why the compilation fails. 
 Here is the snippet. https://scastie.scala-lang.org/itsnashter/HxcapljGSZylOtLyssJbLg/2. Can experts take a look to help me understand the following? 
  
What is the general convention to test the tagless final algebraic resources? I dont want to use unsaferunSync() even in tests. 
 Is having laws for repositories like &quot;create and get&quot; ( &amp; rest like mentioned in scastie) really needed ? The Laws look like they were meant for structures like Monad. 
 Cats laws seem interesting but there is not much to understand for a beginner like me. Are there any blogs?

                              <span>I am working the Exercism Haskell Track and one of the questions asks for a custom set implementation. I studied some community solutions to see what other folks are doing, and came across something that I don&#x27;t quite understand.
 intersection :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; CustomSet a isDisjointFrom :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; Bool isDisjointFrom &#x3D; (null .) . intersection 
 What is this (null .) . intersection ? Should it not be just null . intersection ?

 I have decided to extract my Haskell snippets for LuaSnip into a plugin: haskell-snippets.nvim.
 For those who don&#x27;t know LuaSnip, here&#x27;s an introduction. If you have nvim-treesitter and the parser for Haskell installed, and if you use haskell-language-server, some snippets will be enhanced (e.g. qualified imports and module names).
 I&#x27;ve only recently migrated to LuaSnip, and I expect to add more snippets that leverage tree-sitter and the LSP client in the future (probably also for Nix).

 Apparently the problem due to SimplifedSubsumption and there are two work around. Add an explict type signature or turn on DeepSubsumption. What is still strange in that the problem only occurs with ghci, so I suppose there is a third workaround somewhere having to do with ghci &quot;defaulting&quot; things.

 I&#x27;m trying to migrate my project to a new version of GHC and encounter the following problem (see my previous post). I narrowed it down to the following
 authFA :: AuthPlugin App authFA &#x3D; AuthPlugin &quot;fa&quot; dispatch loginWidget where dispatch &#x3D; \_ _ -&gt; postLoginR &gt;&gt;&#x3D; sendResponse 
 Doesn&#x27;t compile , if replace dispatch with its body
 authFA :: AuthPlugin App
 authFA &#x3D; AuthPlugin &quot;fa&quot; (_ _ -&gt; postLoginR &gt;&gt;&#x3D; sendResponse) loginWidget
 This compiles. I believe this as to do with type defaulting rules but the original code compiled fine with GHC 8.10 but not with GHC 9.2.5.
 Any ideal ?
 Update
 Here is the error  /home/max/devel/mae/Fames/src/Foundation.hs:378:26: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type: m0 b0 with: forall (m :: * -&gt; *).

 Looks like the problem is a GHC issue and there is a workaround see there

 I&#x27;m trying to migrate a project from lts-18-17 to lts-20.11 and I have a strange issue.
 For some reason my AuthPlugin doesn&#x27;t compile anymore even thought according to the release not nothing major has changed on the AuthPlugin side (neither on my project). The error message is a bit cryptic so instead i&#x27;m replace disptach with a hole to see what the exact problem.
 I get the following

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m a newbie at haskell. I want to construct something very simple: Classes for unary and binary operators. Each class should have only one function: evaluate. Something like this:
 class UnaryOperator a where evaluate :: a -&gt; a class BinaryOperator a where evaluate :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a 
 In C++, I would do something like
 template class Operator { public: static T evaluate() &#x3D; delete; ~Operator() {} }; template class UnaryOperator : public Operator { public: static T evaluate(T) &#x3D; delete; }; template class BinaryOperator : public Operator { public: static T evaluate(T, T) &#x3D; delete; }; class Cos : public UnaryOperator { public: static float evaluate(float x){return std::cos(x);} }; class Sum : public BinaryOperator { public: static float evaluate(float a, float b){return a + b;} }; int main() { float a &#x3D; 1.0; float b &#x3D; 3.0; float sum &#x3D; Sum::evaluate(a, b); float cos &#x3D; Cos::evaluate(sum); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum &#x3D; &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl &lt;&lt; &quot;cos(sum) &#x3D; &quot; &lt;&lt; cos &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } 
 Is there anything similar in Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about my ZK and if it supports my dreams. I wonder if I&#x27;m feeding it appropriately. Maybe I should articulate the dream I have for my zettelkasting. &quot;I want it to support my writing.&quot; Is this clear enough? Should I rearticulate it more concretely? What does support mean if I break it down as my stated goal?
Of course, that means that I have to start writing. Does journaling count? Part of how I&#x27;ve procrastinated writing is trying to automate my irregular blog posting. I&#x27;ve spent too much time exploring other alternatives. Automating the publishing of a post is difficult or impossible with my web host, Squarespace.
Here is a fine example of &#x27;Task Switching as opposed to Flow,&#x27; my most recent note. I should take my advice and start and see what develops.
I&#x27;ve been wrestling with Python. I am learning new skills like the application of decorators, building modules, and profiling.
I&#x27;m currently reading:

 I am wondering if it is possible to tangle src blocks from a given .org such that the .el file is created in a separate folder. Any possible leads? Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent quite a lot of time in LISP-land over the last few years and have internalized and begun to rely on a lot of nifty paredit features, for example slurping and barfing.
 When writing and editing, for example, JavaScript or C++ code I end up situations where I instinctively try to slurp identifiers with, obviously, no success.
 Even though there are relatively few cases where this would make sense in non-sexp code, there are the cases of the misplaced parens, for example.. given the code:
 some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); 
 If I decide that I want to wrap one of these arguments in a function, I&#x27;d place the cursor before the argument and enter the function name followed by a left-paren, the mode will be kind and automatically insert a closing paren and I end up with the following, with the cursor inside the parens of &#x60;awesomify&#x60;
 some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, awesomify()another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); 
 This is where I&#x27;d like to do the equivalent of a slurp, effectively moving that closing paren to the end of the next expression - after ànother_splendid_variable&#x60;, but before the comma.
 ​
 I figure I can&#x27;t be the first one to experience the want for something like this. Does it exist? If not, does anyone have a good idea how to implement a minor mode for this?
 It doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% fool-proof for my needs, and I figure it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to just make a dumb language-agnostic implementation for the exact example above. But I&#x27;d also like it to be DWIM:y enough and handle more complex expressions, in which case the mode would somehow need to hook into the syntax model of the language.
 Discuss! Or.. fight! Or insult me. I&#x27;m thankful for basically any thoughts on the matter that could move me in the right direction.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m testing out Void Linux but I&#x27;m having problems with Emacs/EXWM. Essentially the terminal modes are extremely slow when I first start them after starting Emacs. Similarly commands using the (shell-command) function take a long time, and often X applications like Firefox start very slowly.
 I&#x27;ve tried making a custom build of Emacs (people say they had problems with the package on the Void repo) but the problem persists.
 I don&#x27;t have this problem when I run the same config on Arch or Nixos, so I suspect it might be something to do with Void.
 Any other Void users have this problem too?

                              <span>Hello, lovely people. I am trying to get into the emacs. To accompany me in writing notes in org.
 I read the TUTORIAL which helped me to understand basics of emacs. I installed evil-mode(because i am a nevom user and i cannot live without vim bindings).
 But i am trying to create a setup that will help me, create a workflow that i can use as my second brain. I use zettelkasten system for writing notes.
 Are there any packages that use for note taking other then the org-mode.
 Also suggest packages to improve the UI of org files. Like heading symbols, themes, etc.
 Any useful resources on how to use emacs to take notes(Mainly blogs i don&#x27;t like videos).

                              <span>Hi all!
 Sharing my note about fs2-kafka.
 Agenda:
  
make a quick introduction to fs2.Pipe notion;
 discuss possibilities and limitations of turning error-flow into explicit pipeline;
 highlight some non-obvious aspects of offset commitment (especially when we distribute offsets over multiple streams);
 show Weaver suite.

 I hope it&#x27;ll be helpful for somebody :)
 And will be grateful for the feedback!

 import Test.Tasty import Test.Tasty.SmallCheck as SC main :: IO () main &#x3D; defaultMain $ testGroup &quot;Tests&quot; [ SC.testProperty &quot;non-zeros&quot; (changeDepth succ nonZero) ] where nonZero :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool nonZero a b &#x3D; a * b /&#x3D; 0 
 How do I only use non-zero values over my Property?

                              <span>ExceptT from mtl seems to be accumulating errors unlike the deprecated ErrorT. But I do not want it to accumulate errors because that can lead to a space leak when using manyTill equivalents from Alternative. Does anyone know how to get around this? Is there an alternative that does not accumulate errors? Alternatively, can I access the error in some way to force it?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Is there any possibilties to get lsp support and anaconda support while editing remote files on hpc (sun grid engine) and send code lines for python, R or other interpreted languages like I could do in other IDE but there remotely ?
 I thought about install emacs remotely and use tmux session with multiple emacs open, but I am not sure it would be easy (no sudo privileges).
 Also, I am not sure if this is the best set up for working with emacs on hpc.
 PS: I am using Doom emacs

                              <span>Hi there folks, 
 This is my very first post in Emacs community. I am following System Crafters video and wanted to see how would one go about creating multiple projectile projects in its config. Mine currently only shows a single project. I don&#x27;t know how Emacs recognizes project directories:
 (use-package projectile
 :diminish projectile-mode
 :config (projectile-mode)
 :custom ((projectile-completion-system &#x27;ivy))
 :bind-keymap
 (&quot;C-c p&quot; . projectile-command-map)
 :init
 (when (file-directory-p &quot;~/Projects&quot;)
 (setq projectile-project-search-path &#x27;(&quot;~/Projects&quot;)))
 (setq projectile-switch-project-action #&#x27;projectile-dired))
 How to include manual npm projects or git repositories in here ?

 What I am missing is a link to the attached file systematically added in the buffer I am working from, or at least in the clipboard, so that I can include it using org-link
 How can I do it in emacs? Thanks for your support

 Before I try to roll my own, as I have not been able to find a package for this: is there a way to auto insert matching braces context at end braces in programming mode please? As overlay is best for me, but as text could work too. 
 Example.
 If( my condition ) {
 // Some code
 } // my condition &lt;&#x3D; this is inserted as overlay

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I recently installed Emacs 29 with native comp and ImageMagick flags on my system. However, Homebrew also installed a bunch of formulas related to ImageMagick that I believe I will never use. As a result, my brew list looks messy and cluttered.
 I would like to know if there&#x27;s a way to uninstall ImageMagick and all the formulas that were installed alongside it?
 (Note: I&#x27;m on MacOS and I use emacs-plus to install emacs)
 Any guidance on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

Have added it to path but when I start emacs, there is no change to it at all. I am guessing emacs is not picking up the correct init file but I am not sure why.
 Info about my system: Running Arch, I have XDG_CONFIG_DIR set so instead of doom install installing it to the normal ~/.emacs.d/ and ~/.doom.d directories, the things are installed under .config/emacs and .config/doom directories. Reading up the doc it says emacs respects the XDG spec.
 I tried loading the init file under ~/.config/doom/ manually by using emacs -q --load but no change there as well.
 Any help would be great

I have packages installed for scala which includes lsp-mode, which depends on markdown-mode 2.3 and I have obsidian which depends on markdown-mode 2.5. Somehow this was satisfied before I deleted markdown-mode.
 I want to modify markdown-mode, so I&#x27;m using source from git and now either lsp-mode or obsidian-mode complains depending on which version of markdown-mode I have.
 How can I fix that?

                              <span>For a long time, I didn&#x27;t annotate my reading materials because I preferred reading on my tablet instead of my computer. And I never found a good app to use on my Android tablet either. And of course, without proper conversion to org-mode, all of those notes seemed useless.
 Then I discovered org-noter. I was excited but couldn&#x27;t use it. The automatic window handling was frustrating, and I couldn&#x27;t invest the time to fix it. Recently, I needed to take notes from multiple books, so I tried org-noter again, but I still can&#x27;t find the best workflow.
 My initial issue was with the way how org-noter creates a &quot;special&quot; layout with a dedicated window. It sometimes even creates another frame - which I especially hate, even setting org-noter-always-create-frame to nil still occasionally creates a frame. I guess not a huge deal, I can live with that.
 After taking some notes, I noticed they were out of sync the next day. I tried to fix each note&#x27;s page number manually - :NOTER_PAGE: prop, but it would randomly change the page numbers in other notes. Yes, I would open a page in pdf-tools, then I call org-noter-sync-current-page-or-chapter to check if the note and the page numbers match and fix them (when needed). But it also would change page numbers in some other notes. I can&#x27;t figure out why. Clearly, either I&#x27;m doing something wrong, or I need to set some vars or it&#x27;s just a bad combination of things, versions of pdf-tools, poppler, Emacs, etc. on my machine causing these issues. Maybe (like so many things) it just never properly worked on Mac?
 I want this tool to work, but I am struggling to find a workflow that fits. If my notes are consistently out of sync, I can&#x27;t see the point of using org-noter. Can someone please advise me on their workflow, tips, and configuration?

                              <span>Almost one year ago, we had the incredible opportunity to take the stage at #BerlinBuzzwords and those days hold cherished memories for all of us.
 It&#x27;s a story worth sharing with my colleages—a testament to the significance of investing in robust base operational systems built on cloud native and open-source solutions.
 🆕 🆕 🆕
 Considering the current landscape in the market and the growing prominence of ML/NLT/Embedding generation (much more in the Search playground) and the associated cost in large and sometimes inappropriate voluminous training processes, we have a unique opportunity to leverage these advancements to add value to our products without the need for additional investments in specialised and custom solutions.
 This video and the way we operate our data processes holds true now more than ever.
 Ramiro and Daniel, our presence on that stage was truly massive, let&#x27;s continue pushing boundaries and seizing these opportunities.

                              <span>Im new to this Forum and i already wrote a new Post, but it somehow does not appear. So sorry if it ends up being posted 2 times.
I want to start a digital Zettelkasten. 
But software like Obsidian, The Archive only work with keyboard input. I tryed to workaround a little bit:
downside is, i can not update, annotate or work later with the note. annotator in obsidian is pretty bad with pdfs. so the only solution would be to again start the process and update the file in notabillity reupload etc etc etc… terrible workflow.
excalidraw is also pretty bad, compared to notability and goodnotes. not a real option.
is there anyone with the same problem? someone who likes handwritten notes, but dont want to start an analog zettelkasten. the missing search function is real.
i would use notability, but i can not connect and link the notes.
im thankfull for every idea.

                              <span>I am wholly unsurprised that Harold Innis (1894-1952) maintained a card index (zettelkasten) through his research life, but I am pleased to have found that his literary estate has done some work on it and published it as The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis (University of Toronto Press, 1980). The introduction seems to have some fascinating material on the form and structure as well as decisions on how they decided to present and publish it.
For those unaware of his work, primarily as a political economist, he wrote extensively on media and communication theory including the influential works Empire and Communications (1950) and The Bias of Communication (1951). 
While I appreciate the published book nature of the work, it would be quite something to have it excerpted back down to index card form as a piece of material culture to purchase and play around with. Perhaps something in honor of the coming 75th anniversary of his passing?

                              <span>Really weird problem here. I&#x27;m writing my thesis in org-mode. All has been well (after some tweaking) so far, but I have an issue where starting a new section title with the word &quot;Discussion&quot; turns the word red and into a different font, and it shows up in a different font in my Table of Contents. Adding a letter or taking one away fixes it. Not capitalizing it fixes it. Writing &quot;Conclusion and Discussion&quot; fixes it but &quot;Discussion and Conclusions&quot; does not. Only the word Discussion turns red and changes fonts. I have no idea where to begin troubleshooting this :) Anyone have any ideas?
 EDIT: the tex export shows the line \section{{\bfseries\sffamily Discussion} and Conclusions} where the section header is. So something in org thinks I want the word Discussion to automatically change font family for some godforsaken reason. At least I can fix it there for now.

                              <span>Rustic defines its own mode but I don&#x27;t want to use their functions (rustic-compile and rustic-recompile). I tried to wrap compile in my own function (after I&#x27;ve exported rustic-compilation-mode):
 (defun my/compile (command &amp;optional comint) (let ((compilation-mode rustic-compilation-mode)) (compile command comint))) 
 (consider that I&#x27;ve put interactive where needed etc).
 The function works but the mode is compilation-mode, not rustic-compilation-mode. If I M-x rustic-compilation-mode inside this buffer the proper mode is loaded and I can navigate through errors.
 Is there a way to change the major mode of a compilation buffer without having to set it manually after the compilation has ended?

                              <span>I moved to eglot and so far so good, the only thing a bit annoying is when doing a eglot-rename it doesn&#x27;t show the symbol about to be renamed in the initial input. 
 Usually when I do a rename is not to type a complete new symbol but to actually tweak the name, so currently have to do a bunch of M-/ to get it and then tweak it...
 Maybe that&#x27;s not the behavior people expect and rather have a blank initial input ?
 It&#x27;s easy to override the function directly:
 (defun eglot-rename (newname) &quot;Rename the current symbol to NEWNAME.&quot; (interactive (list (read-from-minibuffer (format &quot;Rename &#x60;%s&#x27; to: &quot; (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;unknown symbol&quot;)) (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;&quot;) nil nil nil (symbol-name (symbol-at-point))))) (eglot--server-capable-or-lose :renameProvider) (eglot--apply-workspace-edit (jsonrpc-request (eglot--current-server-or-lose) :textDocument/rename &#x60;(,@(eglot--TextDocumentPositionParams) :newName ,newname)) current-prefix-arg)) 
 wandering if there is a better way to do this (with advice?) than overriding ?
 maybe i should just ask it nicely to the eglot maintainer?

                              <span>We are glad to announce streamly 0.9.0 release. streamly-0.9.0 and streamly-core-0.1.0 have been available on Hackage for some time now, you can find reference documentation and some guides on https://streamly.composewell.com as well. The website also has functionality to search across multiple streamly packages.
 This release did a major revamp of the API to make it easier to comprehend and less error prone to use. Now there is a single &quot;Stream&quot; type instead of the polymorphic &quot;IsStream&quot; type class. There are explicit concurrency combinators to enable concurrent behavior on the same type instead of using different types for that purpose.
 Dependency on GHC rewrite rules has been removed for more robust behavior and better programmer control, though it required splitting the stream type into the default direct-style type &quot;Stream&quot; and the CPS type &quot;StreamK&quot;.
 The package has been split into two, streamly-core intends to depend only on boot libraries (currently has some more deps due to backward compatibility), streamly provides higher level functionality like concurrency.
 Parser functionality has been released. Parsers fuse with streams and are compatible with folds i.e. parsers are folds with more power.
 See the following docs for more details:

                              <span>Hi, Im a haskell beginner and as of now just coding some really basic stuff and trying to develop a familiarity with the language. So I wanted to write the haskell equivalent of the intentionally wrongly written fibonnaci code below and I realised I just probably...can&#x27;t?
 void fib (int a, int b, int n) {
 if( n &lt;&#x3D; 0) return;
 if(b &lt;&#x3D; 0 ){
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, a);
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, b + 1);
 fib (a, b + 1, n-2);
 } 
 //bruh block
 int c &#x3D; a + b;
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, c);
 fib (b, c, n - 1 );
 } 
 int main( ) {
 fib( 0, 0, 5); 
 }
 in this code, i&#x27;ve intentionally left the bruh block of code independent of the block above,i.e., not bind it to the previous if block using an else and that obviosuly produces a output different from the expected fibonacci one. I tried building the haskell equiavlent using guards and if-else-thens and in the process i realised there&#x27;s probably no way to build a freely floating independent block of code in a function that has other conditionals in haskell???....Or is there a way to do it?

                              <span>Tweagers have an engineering mantra — Functional. Typed. Immutable. —
that begets composable software which can be reasoned about and avails
itself to static analysis. These are all “good things” for building
robust software, which inevitably lead us to using languages such as
Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
Last time I wrote about how we can use Python’s1
abstract base classes to express useful concepts and primitives that are
common in functional programming languages. In this final episode, I’ll
cover testing strategies that can be learnt from functional programming
and applied to your Python code.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but apparently when you use the VSCode Neovim plugin, you are actually running Neovim in the backend, so it allows you to do most of Neovim stuff there.
 Can we do the same with emacs? Even if it has a bunch of limits in what we can use, it would be nice to be able to use at least some of emacs stuff (in the very least the keybindings) when you have to use something else for emacs.
 For instance, I would absolutely love if I could use emacs in the backend when I&#x27;m working in collaborative Google Docs.
 Is that possible?

 Is it possible for a macro to know file and line location of where it is expanded?

 ​
 So, started wanting to do everything inside emacs so I configured my &#x60;.emacs&#x60; file so I can read my email and chat on slack. I also started browsing the web with emacs. just simple stuff. but the idea is that when im programming i can do all this during my breaks. 
 i wanted to hear other experiences and learn about how others live inside emacs. so please share!

                              <span>I usually use web-mode for, well, web stuff. 
 But if I open or create a jsx file in web-mode, the syntax coloring is horrible.
 If I switch to js2-mode or js-mode, the coloring is just as bad. 
 What are you guys using to make your jsx files readable?

 Before I go ahead and install Aspell, are there any other options I should be aware of?

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;m trying to implement IJKL movement in Emacs. This means: - M-ijkl for movement - C-M-ijkl for forward/backward word &amp; up/down paragraph - with SHIFT for selection - there are other details but they are probably irrelevant here
 I&#x27;ve stumbled on problem after problem with the C-M-i keybind, which I&#x27;d like to have set as &#x27;backward-paragraph, and finally discovered that C-M-i is a literal equivalent to TAB.
 How can I separate these two? It&#x27;s not the most essential keybind in the world but I&#x27;d like to have it because it makes sense to me.

                              <span>I have a small program which is 99% side effect free.
 (https://gitlab.com/john-orford/micrograd/-/blob/master/MoonExample.hs)
 Yesterday, I started running it in GHCI while debugging / testing etc.
 And I noticed, if I don&#x27;t reload before running, it runs and completes almost instantly.
 Unsure how useful this is in the grand scheme of things, but it&#x27;s quite nifty.
 Does GHCI memoise or something?

                              <span>Hi,
 I started to use lxc container for development (to avoid the lot of development library on my host computer.).
 I use it with vscode + remote plugin but sometimes it is freezing / slowing.
 The lxc is running on my laptop so network is not problem.
 I can use console editor inside in the container but with vscode remote seemed okay and very easy setup at the first time.
 I found this slowness when I use git operations, the type info and intellisense working well.
 I was surprised because it is a POC not a big project.
 What is you experience with this configuration ?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been using Scala on the backend for a many years and like many of us, I use Future for concurrency.
 But, I&#x27;m trying to understand why would I use Future in ScalaJS (just started learning) with JS being single threaded.
 One use-case I found is:
 I wrote a test website in ScalaJS with two links using ScalaTags. Each link/page randomly does a heavy computation and then renders a simple but very long HTML. I want to display a spinner when I click on either of the hyperlinks, until the computation ends and the dom is rendered. Without Future, on clicking either of the hyperlinks the page takes a while to update the dom, it kinda halts the browser, and then it renders my big azz ScalaTags HTML. The spinner does not get displayed (I toggle between display &#x3D; none &amp; display &#x3D; block).
 But, when I set the dom to display the spinner in a Future, and then call the render function in another Future for the page clicked using QueueExecutionContext, now, I can see the spinner. 
 Kinda weird! JS is still single threaded so why would the use of Future result in different behavior?
 Does this also mean that I should be using Future whenever I&#x27;m updating the dom?

                              <span>Could anybody share a simple and efficient (not 0(N2) memory) implementation for showing minimal edits between two strings?
 It probably should be something like Wagner-Fisher algorithm...
 What I am looking for (and hope to avoid implementing it myself:) is something that given two strings would produce a minimal EditedString:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell type EditedString &#x3D; [EditedChar]
 -- Nothing for unchanged characters, True for added, and False for deleted data EditedChar &#x3D; EditedChar {char :: Char, added :: Maybe Bool} 
 -- the required edits to convert the first string to the second editedString :: String -&gt; String -&gt; EditedString &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 We&#x27;ve just released a v5.1 of SimpleX Chat with message editing history among other things (a shameless promo plug), and I really want to see what actually changed in them...
 Disclaimer: I did try to get it out of ChatGPT4, but no much luck...

 As the older programmers retire it becomes a very serious issue.

                              <span>Eshell has a profile and alias file that act like .rc files. Normally to define an alias you can put it in the alias file like this
 alias &#x27;recent &quot;ls -lrt&quot; 
 But that won&#x27;t help me on Windows. When on Windows I&#x27;d like to map it to the powershell equivalent instead, but I&#x27;m not sure how to get it to work in the alias (or profile) file. I&#x27;ve tried variations of this
 (cond ((eq system-type &#x27;windows-nt) (alias &#x27;recent &quot;Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending&quot;)) ((or (eq system-type &#x27;gnu/linux) (eq system-type &#x27;darwin)) alias &#x27;recent &quot;ls -lrt&quot;)) 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work. Does anyone know how to achieve this in Eshell?

                              <span>Hi! 
 I&#x27;m having a problem in installing the ess-18.10.2 in the emacs-28.2. The problem is related to 
 &quot;Wrong number of arguments: (3 . 4), 2&quot;
 and occur in a lot of files. I traced to ess-r-package.el, in the line:
 (define-obsolete-function-alias &#x27;ess-r-devtools-check-package-buildwin &#x27;ess-r-devtools-check-with-winbuilder)
 This seems to be only code line with the problem. The other occurencies of the error are in the &quot;require&quot; statement. 
 The funniest thing is that the problem occurs only in my laptop. I have a desktop with exactly the same software configuration (ess-18.10.2, emacs-28.2, OpenSuse Tumbleweed) and this pack works fine. (in both cases I downloaded the tar.gz from emacs and compiled manualy).
 Someone has any ideia of why it happens? I really can&#x27;t remenber if I made something different in the desktop installation.

                              <span>So, I created this little something called orgish https://github.com/ChanderG/orgish which allows you to manage an org file as a comment embedded inside its own exported html output.
 The idea is to enable use of org to create one-off/standalone html pages - removing the headache of managing 2 files. Just work with a single html file that you can throw onto a static file server.

                              <span>I would greatly appreciate help with trying to install htmlz-mode package - it&#x27;s a very simple package - single htmlz.el file that needs to be evaluated. That&#x27;s it.
 For some reason this (Doom) emacs macro (using straight.el) won&#x27;t work:
 (package! htmlz-mode :recipe (:host github :repo &quot;0xekez/htmlz-mode&quot;)) 
 What does straight.el needs to simply evaluate this damn file on start or when entering &quot;web-mode&quot;?
 I imagine that the author of htmlz-mode haven&#x27;t looked for a way to &quot;properly&quot; package it, but given how complex looking for information on emacs is I can&#x27;t blame him. 
 Is there no way to simply collect tracelog from emacs? Why are there no warnings that it didn&#x27;t evaluate the file? Where would you look for logs? How do you troubleshoot emacs? How do you call this thing &quot;self-documenting&quot; when I experienced the worst documentation out of any open-source tools out there on that user-scale.

                              <span>For me, one thing that is important other than the technical aspects (and Emacs most certainly helps me to work faster and more efficiently on my novels) is the question of self-motivation. To help me with that, I have made a little function that shows me the current progress I have made today when I press s-#.
 It even has a &quot;graphical&quot; aspect to it, the color changes bit by bit from gray to green, and it simulates a &quot;bar&quot; that fills up. The number of characters/pages needed for my daily goal to be done is in a variable I have in my init file.
 I am sorry I opened a new thread, I wanted to post this in the thread &quot;Emacs for literature&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know how to post a picture in an answer to thread. So here is the Minibuffer a few times during the day, to give you some idea of what I mean.
 It is in German, the translation would be: 92.791 characters, 30 pages, equals 56 percent [today new: 0/2] Current page 93 percent, scene 1 page, chapter 1 page.
 In the modeline, I also show what &quot;page&quot; I am on. It just divides the length of the Buffer through the average number of characters on a standard page (3000 characters). Must seem like a very un-Emacsy way of doing things to you, but it helps me to get a feeling of getting things done somehow. :)

                              <span>Before my emacs days, I used nvim with this package called indentLine. Basically it displays (maybe semi-transparent?) vertical lines for same indentation levels . It&#x27;s visually helpful when I&#x27;m in long python code.
 Check these images from this repo: - img1 - img2
 ...
 Is there any alternative to this package (or built-in function) in emacs?

                              <span>I sometimes write markdown documents in which I want to quickly add some python code. Maybe this is the readme of a python project on github, or its a quick blog post that will be processed by my static site generator.
 I know there are million projects along these lines, and many very complex, but I threw my own dead simple one: markdown-notebook minor mode.
  
Load the code.
 Open a markdown document and load the minor mode.
 If you press C-c b it creates a markdown python code block.
 If you press C-c C-c inside a python code block, it sends it to a python shell, and pastes the results back into a blank code block right after the python code block.
 C-c C-x will restart the shell, in case you want to start fresh.
  
Please free to use. Any simple improvements are welcome.

 I then use org-agenda-custom-commands like those below to show work related content or not work related content. This works in Org version 9.5.5/Emacs 28.2, but in Org version 9.6.4/Emacs 29.0.90, both custom-commands shows the content of every file, category &quot;work&quot; or not. Has anything changed between the versions that can explain this behaviour? I haven&#x27;t found any relevant information saying so.

                              <span>I am seeing this weird behaviour. When I start emacs, internal links work as expected: I have a table of contents (created with org-toc) and I can jump from the entry in the TOC to the headline with simply typing return.
 But at some point (and I have been unable to find out what triggers it) when typing return on an internal link I am asked to provide a tags table: &quot;Visit tags table (defaults TAGs): ...&quot;. 
  
Does anybody know if visiting a tags table is expected org behaviour? I traced the code to the best of my abilities and I see that org-link-open is being executed.
 Does anybody know how to inhibit the &quot;visit tags table&quot; behaviour?
  
I do have many packages installed (emacs-prelude) so it might be something else. I tried to use the debugger, but failed to understand how to use it.
 thank you in advance for any hints/ideas.

                              <span>This post is a continuation of the discussion found here: [Link to Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/13guvo3/should_i_go_with_scala_or/), and I would like to share my conclusions.
 ​
 I am thrilled to embark on a journey with Scala and dedicate a significant amount of time to writing projects, starting with my personal blog/portfolio. However, I do have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with:
 ​
 1) What technology stack should I consider?
 ​
 After careful consideration, I have made the decision to use tapir and http4s for my projects. However, I am currently torn between ZIO and Cats. Personally, I am leaning towards ZIO as it seems to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly effect system. Nevertheless, I am aware that Typelevel/Cats is more widely adopted in the industry. Could you please advise me on which one has a greater demand in the market?
 ​
 2) Is it necessary for newcomers to have knowledge of Akka?
 ​
 I have some experience with GraphQL and have been exposed to RPC-like concepts and classic MVC patterns. However, I feel hesitant about diving into actors, as they remind me of the unnecessary complexity I encountered with redux-saga. Would it be mandatory for me to learn Akka for my first few projects, or can I initially focus on other aspects?
 ​
 Thank you in advance for your assistance!
 ​
 P.S. #1 I would greatly appreciate it if you could also recommend any helpful materials such as books or project ideas to aid me on this journey.
 ​
 P.S. #2 As a more serious and long-term project idea, I am considering developing a &quot;Job Aggregator (Scraper)&quot; or a &quot;Job Board.&quot; Personally, I lean towards the first variant as it aligns more with data processing, and I am eager to spend time designing a system that can scrape data in real-time and notify subscribers. 
 P.S. #3 I would like to extend my appreciation to ChatGPT for its assistance in crafting this beautifully written post in English.

                              <span>I apologize if this question has been asked, but I can&#x27;t find a solution or an explanation online.
 I&#x27;m writing a compiler, and have the following definitions in order to get a more organized pattern matching when I&#x27;m messing with the AST: haskell data WYType &#x3D; WYNum | WYArray | WYString | WYBool data Token &#x3D; Identifier | WYType | ... 
 What confuses me is that the compiler doesn&#x27;t recognize WYNum/WYArray/WYString/WYBool as a Token. I feel like mathematically is possible. Shouldn&#x27;t a | (b | c) | d &#x3D; a | b | c | d?
 Thank you for your answer!
 Edit: for more context, this is the error message I get from my Alex file:  • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘WYType’ with ‘Token’ Expected: String -&gt; Token Actual: String -&gt; WYType • In the expression: alex_action_7 In the expression: (1, alex_action_7) In the second argument of ‘array’, namely ‘[(5, alex_action_3), (4, alex_action_4), (3, alex_action_5), (2, alex_action_6), ....]’  The corresponding section of Lexer.x: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; tokens: :- 「([\s\「]+)」 { \s -&gt; Identifier s }  數 { _ -&gt; WYNum }
 { data WYType &#x3D; WYNum | WYArray | WYString | WYBool
 data Token &#x3D; Identifier String | WYType -- More definitions... } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>I am looking for a way to represent an AST with metadata (such as source location info, types, etc). My first attempt at this was making the AST a functor over the metadata type:
 data AST m &#x3D; Apply m (AST m) (AST m) | Var m Symbol | ... 
 or when the AST consists of multiple types:
 data Expression m &#x3D; Apply m (AST m) (AST m) | Var m Symbol | ... data TopLevel m &#x3D; Assign m Symbol (Expression m) | ... 
 But this gets harder and more annoying if I want to have a different type of metadata for the different types in the AST. I then heard about the Fix type constructor:
 data Fix f &#x3D; Fix (f (Fix f)) 
 which allows you to generalize a recursive type, and you can add metadata by making a product with the Const functor. This still has the problem with representing an AST with multiple types, so …</span>

                              <span>Hej fellows!
 When writing my diary, I find myself regularly using C-l in order to recenter-top-bottom until the current line vertically centered.
 Then, I realized that Id love to have a solution that is less manual than automatic.
 I know about centered-cursor-mode, and while it is already better than the default behavior, I am still not satisfied: I literally want point to stay -- in a particular buffer -- in the vertical center, at all times.
 Do you happen to know a package that achieves this?
 Thanks, have a good day!

 However, I was trying to figure out how to use this in vanilla emacs but it does not work since I get the error symbols function definition is void: map! 
 Is there a way to port this to vanilla emacs?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Long time lurking, finally brave enough to ask for help.
 I recently switch from ivy to vertico, corfu and embark. 
 I&#x27;m having issue when corfu-popupinfo kicks in during the autocomplete. It get stuck and can&#x27;t move to the next option. I have searched if someone had the similar bug in github for vertico and corfu but looks like no one is mentioning about. I think at this point, I started to believe something is wrong with my configuration or it&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t work well together. Here a screenshot showing. Also I&#x27;m sharing my configuration and the error message I&#x27;m getting from corfu. I&#x27;m using only lsp-mode without the lsp-ui.
 any tips to help where this bug can come from?
 ​
 Thank you in advance for all the advice&#x27;s and help.

 Is there a fonction in emacs to find in the config where a variable is set?
 When I call  describe-char I can read the name of the font and a parameter with the value 19... I see this value nowhere in my config, and I have difficulties following the logic between font size (ex: 12), or points (120)...
 I do not know how to describe it better...
 Any help is welcome, how to set once and for all the right size for my font.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a quick blog post about the elfeed-webkit package I just published to MELPA.
 It provides a lightweight integration of the elfeed web feed reader with Emacs&#x27; support for embedding webkit widgets, and allows for browsing a feed entry&#x27;s source link right within Emacs, without leaving the context of elfeed.
 Webkit rendering can be toggled on/off manually, or automatically based on an entry’s tags.
 This might be interesting for you if you use elfeed and are subscribed to feeds that don&#x27;t render well as text.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently writing literature in Emacs because I find it much more comfortable, fast, and intuitive compared to traditional text processors. I have been customizing my workspace to create a more aesthetically pleasing environment, although I must admit that I am not an expert in elisp programming, so my attempts have been relatively simple.
 ​
 I am generally satisfied with the outcome so far. However, I would greatly appreciate it if those of you who also use Emacs for writing literature could share any additional tools or suggestions that have proven useful in your own writing processes. I believe that your insights could potentially benefit me as well. Thank you in advance!

 Now you can remove any package prefix and write,
 (bind (my-window-map (:prefix &quot;m&quot; (:repeat &quot;h&quot; #&#x27;windmove-left &quot;j&quot; #&#x27;windmove-down &quot;k&quot; #&#x27;windmove-up &quot;l&quot; #&#x27;windmove-right) &quot;d&quot; #&#x27;delete-window &quot;D&quot; #&#x27;delete-other-windows)) ((:global-map) &quot;w&quot; my-window-map)) 
 in bind block instead of fully typing bind-prefix, bind-repeat, bind-global-map etc.

                              <span>I know that math is expressed with *tex code in orgmode and exported to MathML when using HTML as export format. Am I right so far?
 My problem is that I need a working tex environment for exporting this.
 Is there a way to directly express math in MathML in an org file avoiding the use of tex?
 ​
 btw: This is not about pro and cons of *tex. I&#x27;m a heavy *tex user and know how it works and how to set it up.

                              <span>Hi, so for example I have the key combination C-c C-x set up to open neotree and it works fine, however in certain modes (e.g. inferior lisp mode), I suppose that there are longer key combinations that seem to start with my combination for neotree, because when I type it, it shows &quot;C-c C-x-&quot; in the status bar as if it were waiting for me to input more keys 
 Is there some on the go way I can have it accept C-c C-x as the whole input? there are other cases like this one and I&#x27;d like to know the way to have it accept the shorter key combinations defined when I&#x27;m finished typing them

                              <span>This week my novel »Der letzte Auftrag« climbed to 11th place on the bestseller list in Germany. Planned and written completely in Emacs, with the help of Orgmode, Olivetti, and you guys here at Reddit. Thank you so much!
 https://preview.redd.it/h65k41u1j51b1.png?width&#x3D;1063&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;v&#x3D;enabled&amp;s&#x3D;d0e2a4f014fac06722ea13df2624f842f6a14329
 My website as a writer is (after the old typo3-setup has broken down) is also done via Emacs, it is all static HTML now, but better for viewing with the smartphone than my old page. I tangle the website out of Orgmode into HTML files. If you are interested, the english version, which is somewhat outdated though, is www.titusmueller.de/index_en.html. I need to get the German content translated and bring it up to date.
 Then there is the Agenda for my reading tour through many cities, my e-mails via Mu4e ... You get it: I am hooked. Thank you for making it such a joy even for a non-programmer to use Emacs!

                              <span>Hi, I want to do the following in dired mode: if the object at point is an org-roam file, rename it (move it). However, I want the function to return to the dired buffer after it has done its work. I know I should use save-excursion, however, I am not able to understand how I can combine it with org-roam-buffer-p. Any ideas or help would be awesome. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m really excited to announce the release of Ogma 1.0.9!
 Ogma is a NASA tool that facilitates integrating runtime monitors or runtime verification applications into other systems.
 Use cases supported by Ogma include producing Robot Operating System (ROS 2) packages [3], NASA Core Flight System (cFS) applications [4], and components for FPrime [1] (the software framework used for the Mars Helicopter), as well as generating monitors from requirements specified in natural language [5]. Ogma is also one of the solutions recommended for monitoring in Space ROS applications [2].
 Ogma leverages existing Haskell work, like the Copilot language [6] (also funded by NASA) and BNFC [7].
 For more details, including videos of monitors being generated and flown in simulators, see: http…</span>

                              <span>This year, Google did not select Haskell as an open-source project for the Google Summer of Code program. In line with tradition, the Haskell community stepped up, with multiple individuals, companies, and non-profit organizations funding nine significant open-source contributions to the Haskell ecosystem:
  
Cabal file support for HLS
 Implement Resolution Methods in HLS
 Goto Definition for Third-Party Libraries in HLS
 Teaching Weeder About Type Class Instances
 Standardize GHC’s Error Dump in JSON Format
 Maximally Decoupling Haddock and GHC
 Representing Pattern
 Improving Calligraphy
 Structured Errors and Error Codes for cabal-install
  
For more details about the accepted projects, the participants, and the mentors, see this announcement: https://summer.haskell.org/news/2023-05-14-summer-of-haskell-2023-project-selections.html

 I&#x27;ve a basic jsaddle project with reflex-dom calculator sample.
 It&#x27;s working well with chrome but freezing with firefox.
 I read about that the jsaddle not working with firefox because the lacking of ~sync xhr request ... I would like to change my angular+Haskell Backend concept... Do you have experience with it ?
 Question 2: maybe Elm is a better choice?

                              <span>How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.
I&#x27;ll start.
I&#x27;m reading some lightweight new books:
Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī and Gafori, Haleh Liza. Gold, Simon and Schuster. 2022.
Faulkner, Grant. The art of brevity: crafting the very short story, Prometheus Books. 2023.
I&#x27;ve released the pressure cooker steam that I put myself in by taking a graduate-level writing seminar on food. since the class ended, the floodgates burst, doubling the time spent in the garden of my ZK. Some of my structure and sub-hub notes have gotten large, and I find I&#x27;m looking at refactoring them. Thinking about structure note size, I&#x27;m not sure smaller is better in the age of fast search. I have a bunch of search tools/extensions that help focus link creation and finding stuff for the output side of zettelkasting. A technique I&#x27;m stealing from someone on the forums is when placing a note on a structure note to look closer at links already on the structure note for link candidates. The fact that they are placed in a particular section of a structure note means the note is surrounded by ideas that relate. Or maybe I can figure out a way to link to a section of structure notes. (I already have a method of linking to a specific place in a note but don&#x27;t use it in this workflow.)
Python programming continues to be exciting, and having a large collection of notes as a playground has been fruitful. I&#x27;ve expanded &quot;Idea Explorer&quot; to provide more information about a note thread. It now has tabs for the &quot;Tag Map&quot; and a tab with all the one-sentence summaries of the notes listed together.  I continue to work with trending for my ZK dashboard. Part of which is behind &quot;My Ten-day Zettel Production.&quot;
Once again, writing precedes my thinking.

 I want to version control my bookmarks to share them between machines, but these extra marks that get created automatically seem to get in the way.
 Do y&#x27;alls know of a way to disable the creation of those bookmarks without altering the source, and/or can you think of a workaround for version controlling and sharing bookmarks between my machines without constantly having changes to the file present that I did not make?
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>I started work on this theme called &quot;Cacao&quot;. I do tech su pport work during the day and happen to reverse colors on an image and got a very pleasing set of colors and decided to try it on EXWM (Emacs window manager). It&#x27;s still a work in progress, but I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to get a few opinions as it&#x27;s more or less up and running!
 Feel free to let me know whether it&#x27;s good, bad or indifferent. I&#x27;m pretty thick skinned :) .

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;m running Gentoo and using EXWM.
 I&#x27;m trying to set it up so that startx launches emacsclient. I start the server with emacs --daemon --eval &quot;(require &#x27;exwm)&quot; -f exwm-enable (I&#x27;ve tried running this both from TTY and from within .xinitrc). In .xinitrc I start emacsclient with exec emacsclient -c.
 Once I&#x27;ve started the server and run startx, Emacs works perfectly the first time. But if I exit with C-x C-C (or switch to TTY2 and killall emacsclient) and run startx a second time, Emacs freezes and the frame shows up smaller and in the top-left corner of the screen.
 If it helps here&#x27;s my .xinitrc:
 # Disable access control for the current user xhost +SI:localuser:$USER # Make Java applications aware this is a non-reparenting window manager export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING&#x3D;1 # Set default cursor xsetroot -cursor_name XC_crosshair # Set keyboard repeat rate xset r rate 200 60 # Start emacs # emacs --daemon --eval &quot;(require &#x27;exwm)&quot; -f exwm-enable exec emacsclient -c 
 And here&#x27;s the relevant bit of my init.el:
 (use-package exwm :straight t :config (require &#x27;exwm-config) (setq exwm-workspace-number 1) (exwm-enable)) 
 Also there&#x27;s this in early-init.el that might be relevant but I doubt it:
 (push &#x27;(fullscreen . maximized) initial-frame-alist) (push &#x27;(ns-transparent-titlebar . t) default-frame-alist) (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t frame-resize-pixelwise t) 
 How can I find out what&#x27;s causing the issue? I just can&#x27;t understand why it works the first time but not the second time.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I regularly swap between Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. Sometimes I have internet, sometimes I&#x27;m on a vpn that blocks package downloads, and sometimes I don&#x27;t have access to internet at all. This makes it difficult to download and install the Emacs packages I normally use through melpa and elpa. I&#x27;d like to version control my .emacs.d for when I have internet access, and keep it on a thumbdrive when I don&#x27;t. 
 But I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the best way to go about this is portably. Do I just 
  
Create a folder called offline-packages
 Download each package I use from git
 add this line to my .emacs.d? (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/offline-packages/my_package&quot;)
  
(require &#x27;my_package)
 Can I just do git add elpaand just commit the entire folder under version control? If I do this on my Windows PC will the .elc files work on my macOS or Linux pc? If not how do I handle the recompilation? How have other people approached this?

                              <span>TLDR: side windows are awesome, you should use them.
 A while ago I posted https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/12jfsan/fixed_window_layout_like_cedet/ and got a reference to https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager - and that has been life-changing. I&#x27;ve ordered the book purely to appreciate the insights in this article. I&#x27;m of course convinced I will find a lot of good stuff in it, but I haven&#x27;t even began digging into it. But I did create the following little snippet that has in the last 24h already improved my quality of life significantly:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t) ;; Introduce a bottom side window that catches ;; compilations, deadgreps etc. (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x27;(&quot;\deadgrep.\|\Compilation\&quot; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . bottom) (slot . 0) (window-parameters (no-delete-other-windows . t))))
 (defun deets/side-window-resize (enlarge) (let ((bottom-windows (window-at-side-list (window-normalize-frame nil) &#x27;bottom))) (dolist (window bottom-windows) (when (symbolp (window-parameter window &#x27;window-side)) (if enlarge (window-resize window (window-height window)) (window-resize window (- (/ (window-height window) 2))))))))
 (defun deets/side-window-toggle (arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (cond ((null arg) (window-toggle-side-windows)) ((listp arg) (deets/side-window-resize t)) ((symbolp arg) (deets/side-window-resize nil))))
 ;; Remove our side-windows (global-set-key (read-kbd-macro &quot;C-x w&quot;) &#x27;deets/side-window-toggle) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When compiling or grepping, the window is placed a the bottom. I can quickly enlarge/shrink the window, and toggle it. Very happy with this, and I&#x27;m already thinking about further improvements.

 (setq org-image-actual-width 500) (setq org-image-actual-height 300) 
 However, only &quot;(setq org-image-actual-width 500)&quot; works, &quot;(setq org-image-actual-height 300)&quot; did nothing to images.
 is it possbile set org image&#x27;s max size as it does markdown mode:
 (setq markdown-max-image-size &#x27;(500 . 300))

                              <span>I use Emacs with the frame tiled to the right half of the display (Meta+Right on KDE Plasma, X11) and Firefox tiled to the left. Upon hitting Meta+Right, the Emacs frame tiles perfectly onto the right half, but after hitting M-x, Emacs resizes itself, presumably to be multiples of the font, leaving ugly gaps on the edges of the display.
 I&#x27;ve tried (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t) (with Emacs 28.2 without init files) from the Frame Size section of the manual, but the problem remains. Is there a solution to this?

                              <span>ekg is a note-taking PKMS system, similar to org-roam but with different design choices, and a different storage, where all data goes into a sqlite database for speed and ease of change. 
 Version 0.3 has two significant changes: inline commands, and Logseq syncing.
 Inline commands are commands that are embedded in the text and, when viewed in the &#x60;ekg-notes-mode&#x60;, replaces itself with a calculated output. Right now there are commands included in ekg that are related to transclusions, so you can now just include the text of a note, a file, or a webpage, in a note. But you can also write your own inline commands to do whatever you want.
 There are also inline commands related to the current note you can use, where the various types a note can have can output a text representation of the da…</span>

                              <span>Our school has an enforced linter called assai it is a simple script that can be installed in $PATH and be called by doing assai filename the error messages look like as follows:  file_name:linenumber: ERROR: error_message file_name:linenumber: WARNING: error_message  So I figured I could integrate it with flymake by using the annotated flymake-backend example as a guide. So I made the following regex parsers for the error codes.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (defvar flymake-assai--message-regexp (rx bol (group (+? nonl)) &quot;:&quot; (group (+? num)) &quot;:&quot;; file name:line: (+ space) (group (or &quot;error&quot; &quot;warning&quot;)) ; type ) &quot;Regexp to match assai messages.&quot;)
 (defun flymake-assai--parse-assai-message (line) &quot;Parse a assai message from LINE.&quot; (when (string-match flymake-assai--message-regexp line) (let ((file-name (match-string 1 line)) (line-number (string-to-number (match-string 2 line))) (type (match-string 3 line)) (message (substring line (+ (match-end 3) 2)))) &#x60;(:file-name ,file-name :line-number ,line-number :type ,type :message ,message))))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 My question is how can I use the regex parsers as a backend for flymake because the annotated example calls the checker on the current buffer but I can not do that because the script can only be run on a file with a valid file name.
 The annotated example mentioned above can be found on https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs//manual/html_node/flymake/An-annotated-example-backend.html

                              <span>Dear Fellow Scala Enthusiasts!
 I&#x27;m pleased to announce that Tyrian 0.7.0 has just been released. 🚀
 Tyrian is a Scala 3, Elm-like frontend web framework for Scala.js, and I&#x27;m particularly excited about this release. There&#x27;s only a few real changes in it, but they&#x27;re good ones! ...some of them are also quite fundamental to how Tyrian works, so please report any problems or come and say hello on our Discord server if anything looks odd: https://discord.gg/b5CD47g 😅
 First, one of the most requested features has finally been implemented: Tyrian now has frontend routing as standard. You can now make multi-page SPA&#x27;s with minimal fuss.
 Second, Tyrian&#x27;s tiny runtime has been completely rewritten, resulting in super snappy start up times, and better performance than ever thanks to the wizards behind Cats Effect 3.5. (Please don&#x27;t forget that Tyrian works equally well with both CE and ZIO.)
 Third, another oft requested feature: You can now start Tyrian apps just by embedding the script in a page. No more launching via JavaScript if you don&#x27;t want to!
 Finally, a small but welcome usability improvement around our CSS property naming. Properties are now available in &#x60;camelCase&#x60; as well as their original &#x60;kebab-case&#x60;.
 Full details are in the release notes: https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.7.0
 All examples and Tyrian&#x27;s g8 template have been brought up to date, the docs site will probably lag behind a bit as usual. 😬
 I hope you give it a go, and don&#x27;t be shy about hoping onto our Discord server if you need any help ...or even if you just fancy chatting about frontend dev, game dev, or to generally heap praise on Scala.js.
 Happy routing!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m having an odd issue where VSCode opens multiple instances of the Haskell Language Server and each consumes 1.5GB of RAM and it is slowing my system to a crawl. Any suggestions on what is causing this?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have written DSLs in the past (too many of them) and find that actually Haskell itself would itself be nicer, more versatile and easier as ‘DSL’; limit the DSL by allowing only certain types to be used. 
 Is that possible (guess yes; make your own Prelude)?
 Then I would want to use this to generate code (doesn’t have to be readable; it won’t be human edited or read); instead of writing a lexer, parser etc; is there an easier way, considering the language already has everything available? So I am looking for something I can execute (I can with the first question of this post) and, when happy, generate code. 
 Anything easier/already done besides figuring out how to use the GHC internals to do this? 
 (Usual apologies if this has been asked and answered before, but the search gave me only DSLs and such)

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if Haskell is gaining or losing popularity, because I&#x27;m receiving conflicting signals. On the one hand, technical progress is fantastic: there is IDE support in form of HLS, GHC is having regular and frequent releases and great features (JS and WASM backends). On the other hand, job offers are still scarse (seem even scarsier then they used to be) and we see some companies move away from Haskell (Facebook / Meta?)
 So what is your opinion? Is it winning of losing? And if it is losing the to what language? And why?

 The error temporarily goes away when I refresh the browser, and the changes to the js file are then reflected in the browser. Any subsequent file changes result in the error again.
 How do I set this up properly? Im having no issue with &quot;Live server&quot; in vscode, but I would love to get this working in emacs. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Is there a way to list all interactive functions? Specifically, I want to see what are the interactive functions that a package provides (it uses a specific prefix). Perhaps a variable that holds them?
 The completion of M-x shows the functions I want to enumerate. But I don&#x27;t know how to cut and paste the list that it generates.
 thank you in advance

 I&#x27;m having a few issues with getting all these components to work together.

 Github: An Explanation of How I Use Emacs
 I wrote it up for the guys in System Crafters because some of them have been asking me for about a year (and Prot too), so I finally did it. The reason is: I&#x27;m not a programmer, so they&#x27;re all curious how and why I use Emacs.
 It&#x27;s a rough draft, I have to revise it already and make it better. But I was told that people here might find it interesting, so I hope that some at least do.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to run Emacs inside a Distrobox container so I can isolate my LaTeX environment and editor from the main OS, but having issues with package-install as it refuses to install some packages or it seems to partially install some (using a standard install from Melpa setup). For example, Auctex seems to work fine, but cdlatex is nowhere to be found, while in the OS install it all simply works. Probably some permissions or paths not being found? Anyway, what kind of extra configuration do I need to do to make this work?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use a lxc container for my development. I can use emacs as a console application but I would like to know is there any other solution where I can use graphical emacs. I don&#x27;t want to deploy vnc or xorg to the server.
 Could I use the emacs server to connect the server with emacsclient ?
 Any solution what you use is interesting for me!
 thanks is advance!

                              <span>I get an error with my config, fix it after struggling a lot and then some other random fucking error happens again (mostly it&#x27;s some evil or evil dependent package) after I open emacs after a few days. Why does this even happen?
 I have been using vim with same config from 2 years and it never needs any corrections. 
 And why is emacs so slow when it has many packages that it requires a daemon to be launched first if you want quick access to client? My vim also has tons of packages and it starts almost immediately. 
 You might say why the fuck would I want to even use emacs then? I need this for org-mode. I wrote many of my previous notes in org and even today it feels like org mode is best organising thoughts and also makes it easy to export to other formats. Vim doesn&#x27;t have a good org equivalent.

Unfortunately auctex seems to be a bit fiddly (and maybe is not playing nicely with elpaca, which otherwise I&#x27;m well happy with). 
 Am I missing something or is the basic idea right (auctex and latex-preview) but auctex just doesn&#x27;t play nicely with elpaca or I&#x27;m missing the right incantation?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I was extremely happy with how I could run &quot;pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode&quot; in a buffer with pdf-view and the pdf would then match the color scheme of the current theme. However, after I have messed around and updated packages, this doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Now I just get a black background instead of the background color of the theme. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this?
 I did try to delete all the packages in the elpa-folder and run everything again, but with the same result. There are some warnings during installation/compilation such as &quot;Warning: the function ‘pdf-view-desired-image-size’ is not known to be defined&quot; and a few others. I hope somebody can help or have had similar issues with pdf-tools. 
 Thanks in advance.

 When sharing markdown during screencast virtual meetings I usually do
 C-x 4 c - clone-indirect-buffer: create a new view bellow the current view in the same window and moves point to it
 C-x 5 C-o - create a new frame of the currently vising buffer. Manually select it
 C-c C-x C-m - Toggle Markup Hidding of this markdown buffer
 When I screen share in meetings, some less-tech savy people are shied by link syntax, bold, italics, and markup hiding helps. I do my notes in the direct buffer.
 Now to my question: Can I advise the indirect buffer to follow point of the direct buffer?

                              <span>Hi coolest folks on earth, which is the Emacs community,
 ​
 Im using the Orgzly app on Android. Im not super crazy about better syncing, and all. Just want a veyr simple way to read a random org file when I dont have access to my laptop. My Org files locally have multiple nested directories. Some are old and needed rearranging. Orgzly has a strange concept which is NoteBook. Thats not the issue, the real issue is it cant recursively download .org files properly. I use org mode mainly on laptop, so I just cloned my org notes to a new local place, rearrange in a single level folder, and plan to sync it from there. Do you have any better ideas? Or better apps? Any tips like renaming files is also welcome (but prefer not to).
 ​
 picture is output from Linux tree command of my original org notes. And 2nd is Dropbox, which I &quot;leveled out&quot; (not completely done) becoz Orgzly syncs from Dropbox.

                              <span>I use org-mode to manipulate large files and obsidian to handle tiny file along with mobile.
 Is it possible to drag local images to markdown file as org-download does to org-mode?
 After years and years and years and years jumping and time-wasting between multiple mobile apps which supoort org-mode, I finally fixed obdian permanantly and determined never invest a second to try any single mobile others.

                              <span>Seeing people publishing their Tic Tac Toe games here, I decided to show my fully functional, documented, local 3D chess game written in Haskell. A quick glance at the software stack and features:
  
Vulkan for the rendering.
 The package effectful to keep the game logic independent from orthogonal aspects like logging, window handling, memory management and debugging.
 The package apecs for the overall game architecture.
 GLTF for importing 3D models from Blender.
 Features include moving pieces, 3D rotation, smooth zooming, a skybox, lighting and jumping knights :-)
  
As you will recognize in the linked repository, the chess game is merely a running example of a larger endeavour: while implementing the game, I separated the reusable parts of the game into separate packages. The result of this process is hagato (Haskell Gamedev Toolkit), a collection of loosely coupled, easily combinable sub-libraries which can be used or ignored as desired, thus allowing developers to select features and technologies at will while remaining in full control of the overall game architecture. It makes use of the new cabal feature which allows one to put multiple public libraries into a single package.
 I published some additional packages on Hackage while implementing the game: apecs-effectful for integrating apecs into effectul, resource-effectful for managing resources in effectful, and chessica which implements the pure chess logic used in the 3D game.
 However, the chess game was just a testbed, to be honest. My overall goal is to use hagato now to implement the game I wanted to build in the first place, but I cannot share any details yet.

                              <span>I have a collection of alternatives that can be run in any order but the probability of success is highly correlated with the previous successful alternative. Is there a library that can help optimize this?
 Ultimately, it would be best if a model could be exported and compiled into the code to reduce the overhead of the optimizer.

 Changes since v2.9.3:
 Behavior changes:
  
Add flag --[no-]-only-local-bin to Stack’s upgrade command for a binary upgrade. If the Stack executable is my-stack, the default is my-stack upgrade --only-local-bin where previously it was, effectively, my-stack upgrade --no-only-local-bin. If the Stack executable is stack, the default is stack upgrade --no-only-local-bin, the same behaviour as previously.
 Use $XDG_CACHE_HOME/stack/ghci-script, rather than /haskell-stack-ghci (where  is the directory yielded by the temporary package’s System.IO.Temp.getCanonicalTemporaryDirectory), as the base location for GHCi script files generated by stack ghci or stack repl. See #5203

                              <span>Hi all,
 I created scala-sbt-codespaces-template — a GitHub repository template for Scala 3 development in GitHub Codespaces. 🙂
 The repository gives you a minimal sbt project, ready to be extended, within a fully-fledged, cloud-based development environment at one click. All you have to do is create a new repository based on this template repository (or alternatively fork it) and click “Create codespace on main”, that’s it.
 Such Codespaces template repositories exist for many languages, but I couldn’t find one for Scala. The repository is so simple and small that I wasn’t sure whether I should even post this here, but maybe it comes in handy for some of you.
 If you do give it a spin, please let me know what you think and what should be improved/added.
 All the best
 Lucas
 EDIT: Following u/BrilliantArmadillo64’s suggestion, I renamed the repo to reflect that it’s sbt-based.

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 I use org-mode (from melpa) daily on macOS Ventura, with very litte other packages (counsel ivy swiper). I’ve been alternating between homebrew’s emacs-plus as well as https://emacsformacosx.com with the same results.
 The specific things I have experienced everyday for some time now:
  
 (the most annoying) Jumping from a calendar entry to the corresponding source tasks works for a while, then appears to continue tuowork but does not jump to the right place. org-lint does not complain about the file structure. Exiting and restarting Emacs fixes the problem.
  org-capture randomly hangs, specifically when using C-c C-q (org-set-tags-command) in the capture window. Killing emacs works and recover-this-file recovers correctly though.
  
I understand that this may be a very specific issue with my configuration, so this is not a rant about org-mode, rather a request for any pointers where or what I should look at.
 Regards, -bd

                              <span>Currently have helm which is doing the same thing that vertico did for me. When in dired mode if I use + to create a new directory I am unable to create for example &quot;dotfiles&quot; in my home directory, instead it says &quot;Cannot create directory /home/jen/.doom.d: files exists&quot; and what I have tried is searching around the describe variables to see if there was something to disable for dired. As well I have tried searching the internet which lead to suggestions of C-Backspace as well as adding a trailing /
 Not sure how I am supposed to create a new directory that does not already exist in dired when there is an autocomplete generated that interferes. I thought it might have been vertico specific but then helm is doing the same. I read how I could disable it for dired mode but how it was not recommended. How should I be doing this.
 I am not using doom, I was but have since started building my own configuration.

 The date/time prompt clearly says &quot;Date+time&quot; so shouldn&#x27;t just hitting enter result in a timestamp with the date and time? I understand I can type the time in manually with &quot;12:35&quot; or something and it will be inputted by is there no feature to automatically insert the current time into the timestamp???
 I am using spacemacs, but I don&#x27;t think that is affecting anything here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a package to integrate Bigcode/Starcoder into Emacs like https://github.com/zerolfx/copilot.el does with Github Copilot.
 (My previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13dlycc/bigcodestarcoder_integration/)
 Instead of the previous approach that just inserts the first fetched response, starhugger can now display previewing overlays and allow switching among a number of suggestions.
 Optionally there&#x27;s also starhugger-mode-auto, to automatically trigger suggestions as you type. But use this mode with caution, as it can result in you being hit by the rate limit even if you have set an access token.

 Mode-line as header-line
 I then tried to transfer the mode-line keymap to the header-line keymap with
 (define-key mode-line-major-mode-keymap [header-line] (lookup-key mode-line-major-mode-keymap [mode-line])) (define-key mode-line-minor-mode-keymap [header-line] (lookup-key mode-line-minor-mode-keymap [mode-line])) 
 This will allow the clicks on major/minor modes in the header line to act like they do in the mode-line.
 But I don&#x27;t want to do this for all the things displayed in the mode-line. Is there a way to bind all the keys bound to [mode-line mouse-1] to [header-line mouse-1] or do I have to find all the elements of my mode-line one by one and do what I did just above?

I&#x27;ve noticed that enabling &#x60;direct-async-process&#x60; as per https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-processes.html makes a lot of things MUCH faster. Notably magit. But some things don&#x27;t work, like vterm, and others hang for seemingly no reason, like compilation-mode. All of this stuff is stable, but slower, with it turned off. Is there a way to selectively turn it on for certain modes? It would be great to just use it in magit for example. Or has anyone noticed ways to make this less flaky overall?

                              <span>Recently, I was just scouring the web for ways to speed up LSP to improve its speed and I stumbled across this project called lsp-bridge and gave it a shot, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a real game changer, It is blazingly fast and it outright beats the original LSP project with its speed and performance. From the day I tried this, I never looked back to using the original LSP again.
 Here is the link to the project:

                              <span>I have been trying emacs recently, I installed lsp-mode, lsp-ui, and lsp-treeemacs, I am using that with corfu for autocompletion, but overall I feel like the whole thing is slow, autocompletion is slow (it&#x27;s not slow without lsp-mode) the suggestions are irrelevant to what I type sometimes, diagnosis is slow, sometimes the whole interface blocks when I am moving my cursor too fast.
 does anyone experience something similar? or is it just me? I tried neovim&#x27;s lsp features and they are much faster compared to emacs, I would say even vscode is faster. Is this some issue with elisp threading or something?
 ​
 here is my lsp config for reference 
 ;; lsp mode (use-package flycheck :ensure t) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t :custom (lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (gc-cons-threshold 100000000) (read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) (lsp-log-io nil) :hook (c-mode . lsp) :commands lsp) (use-package lsp-ui :ensure t :custom (lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil) :commands lsp-ui-mode) (use-package lsp-treemacs :ensure t :commands (lsp-treemacs-symbols lsp-treemacs-errors-list lsp-treemacs-references)) 
 ​
 and this is my corfu config 
 ​
 ;; corfu for autocompletion (use-package corfu :ensure t :bind (:map corfu-map (&quot;S-SPC&quot; . corfu-insert-separator)) :init (global-corfu-mode) (corfu-history-mode) (corfu-popupinfo-mode) :custom (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto-delay 0) (corfu-auto t) (corfu-preview-current nil) (corfu-popupinfo-delay 0.2) (corfu-right-margin-width 1)) (use-package kind-icon :ensure t :after corfu :custom (kind-icon-default-face &#x27;corfu-default) (kind-icon-blend-background nil) :config (add-to-list &#x27;corfu-margin-formatters #&#x27;kind-icon-margin-formatter))

                              <span>Hi, I am still seeking a clean way to get the path to my note, as requested here https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1401/request-some-way-of-getting-note-file-path#latest
To repeat my ask: apart from the current menu entry &quot;Edit &gt; Copy Link To Note&quot;, I request a &quot;Edit &gt; Copy Path to Note&quot;, which will give me enough information, and which will hopefully will be trivial for you to write.
Or, if the path to the archive is stored, perhaps somewhere in ~/Library, I can read from there...
Also, much less critical so feel free to ignore, is there yet a way to programmatically change the current folder?
Many thanks,
  Abhijit</span>

                              <span>Just like the other recent posters (1, 2), I&#x27;ve been creating Tic Tac Toe in Haskell. My goal is a bit different, though. I&#x27;m more interested in comparing different playing &quot;agents&quot; than implementing the game. To that end, I&#x27;ve created a program that lets you select agents and pit them against each other repeatedly. 
 Here&#x27;s a link: https://github.com/palf/tic-tac-tournament
 ​
 What&#x27;s currently in that repo is a work-in-progress; I&#x27;ve a list of further improvements to make. I&#x27;m posting this a little earlier than planned to jump on the Tic Tac Toe bandwagon :D 
 I&#x27;m exploring reinforcement learning, and how to optimise the learning agent. Future work includes:
  
a way of assessing how &#x27;converged&#x27; the weights map is compared to a perfect player - then I can better assess the adjustments to…</span>

This is different than the super org-file method I&#x27;ve followed, which leverages some excellent narrowing/searching tools to get around.

Is there a simple way to have emacs in read-only, specifically when editing source code, and toggle it on and off with a simple keybinding?
 Something like:
  emacs --eval &#x27;(setq buffer-read-only t)&#x27;  strikes me as a workaround and not a solution. Is the simplest way to just have this as my default emacs startup and define a key-binding to toggle it? How would I do that?

 If this can be done using org-modern, it would be amazing to learn how. Otherwise, if someone knows how to do this with either prettify symbols or some other way that would be great too. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi !
 I&#x27;m trying to setup one set of universal keybinding that adapt if I&#x27;m in project or not
 (defun smart-for-files () (interactive) (if (projectile-project-p) (consult-projectile) (find-file default-directory))) (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;smart-for-files) 
 This work properly, the only thing is that find-file open dired instead of the vertico interface that I normally use. Why?I&#x27;m searching for a while but I didn&#x27;t find anything properly related.Is this the right way to do it?
 I thought that calling this with (interactive) will behave as I expeted.
 Thanks
 EDIT: Found the solution my self scavenging like a maniac. The desidered result is obtained using ido-find-file, where (now I kwow) &quot;I&quot; stand for interactive.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn more about whether should I really not rebind it to zooming out.
 Upon some research I determined that for example M--5 C-n works just as well as C-- M-5 C-n (as an useless example just to check).
 ​
 According to chatgpt it is historic and was deemed as a more comfortable way to differentiate between minus as negative operator and as command line argument (like --help).
 Backslashes are used to escape characters such as minus etc. for this CLI functionality instead and chatgpt confirmed this was common before Emacs began this weird thing instead of using backslashes if ever necessary anyway.
 Furthermore, I just found that both M-- and C-- are both bound to negative-argument. So do these two keybindings have different functionality in different contexts, or are they always the same? Because why have two enabled by default? (Maybe for user convenience of different keyboard layouts, but this is a bit too confusing more than necessary, maybe the devs meant to implement keyboard layout detection but failed..?).
 This All may seem dumb to be asking, (like why not just rebind C-- to zoom out and get over with it) but I&#x27;m confused thinking that there probably should be a good reason this is not by default in Emacs yet.
 Maybe I&#x27;m just thinking too highly of the &quot;intelligent design behind Emacs&quot;? I hope not.
 kind Regards.

 I want to retain the modeline (so disabling is not an option)
 What configurations or packages are others using to have a more organized / less obtrusive modeline?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;m very new to Emacs so bear with me..
 I&#x27;ve been using ESS at work to run my R code in Emacs, and it usually works very well (apart from lsp/eglot and flycheck being very slow). However when I run a large amount of R code using polymode-eval-buffer or similar, the code will run, however I will be unable to interact with Emacs the whole time, mousing over Emacs shows the windows loading symbol as my cursor, but doesn&#x27;t say &quot;not responding&quot;. The file isn&#x27;t particularly long, ~800 lines, and if I run it in two halves using polymode-eval-buffer-from-point-to-end or polymode-eval-buffer-from-beg-to-point it works as expected.
 The code takes a long time to run, loading in a couple million spatial points and doing stuff with them, which I&#x27;m sure is the main reason it happens, but running this code in Rstudio doesn&#x27;t freeze it!
 I&#x27;ve read online in various places that setting ess-eval-visibly to nil or nowait solves some peoples issues, but doesn&#x27;t change anything for me...
 Thanks for any help you guys can give!

                              <span>Microsoft Access has a few virtues, like being a desktop app and rather robust in its ability to customize (by Microsoft standards). At its most basic, it will read from and write to a database, usually through Forms that have been customized to display certain information from a database in a certain layout. And because it works with one source of truth (e.g., it can connect to SQL and PostgreSQL databases), multiplayer data entry and collaboration is more feasible than in a purely plain text method being shared by a syncing service.
 The problem is, Microsoft Access is one sin shy of being the devil. It’s proprietary and buggy, and coding in VBA is a nightmare compared to most languages, especially our beloved elisp. Someone said MS Access is the best worst way to make a database program, and I think that sums it up well.
 I know emacs can interface with SQL databases, but are there any packages that try to accomplish something like Microsoft Access, i.e., rapid application development via forms that display and allow editing certain fields from a database? If not, what would be the best practices in building this functionality?

                              <span>I want something between  &amp;  to be font-locked w/ the keyboard face and then exported to latex using the menu-keys package. Has anyone done something similar. I saw something in the past about doing something similar with quotation marks, but I couldn&#x27;t find that anymore.

                              <span>In the last year I&#x27;ve started using emacs at work. The language I end up using most is php with the Laravel framework. Laravel implemented a php repl called Tinker that loads the laravel framework and allows the user to interact with it. Where would I begin if I wanted to integrate the same thing with emacs? I know SLIME, et. al. is impossible without a major php rewrite but I&#x27;d like to get as close as possible. I don&#x27;t want just a repl but a buffer where I can send files or selected code to the repl and receive the output in the repl buffer. Is there a good plugin I could maybe learn from in order to write it or does anyone know of one already that I haven&#x27;t been able to find?

                              <span>I used writeroom-mode for hours and find the &quot;distraction-free writing mode&quot; is amazing.
 Then it comes to me that a standard mode-line mode provides unnecessary noisy messages such as major mode, file name which I absolutely know.
 How could set it as simple as a black separate line：

 I tried as:
 (setq mode-line-format writeroom-mode-line) ;; the above dispaly the same as the below (setq mode-line-format nil) 
 The mode-line vanished even without a separate line.

A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing that creates an interconnected web of thought. Its emphasis is on connection and not mere collection of ideas.

                              <span>Philosopher Richard Y. Chappell has written a straightforward and readable Git+Pandoc software setup and workflow guide suitable for academic writing. [Academics don&#x27;t want you to know this secret trick: this free software setup is workable for writers of all kinds.] Professor Chappell&#x27;s guide walks you through the software installation, which includes git for version control, Pandoc for document processing, and the VSCode editor with plugins for Pandoc citations and document export. After the one-time software installation, the writer begins each document with a Markdown template. The Markdown template includes some LaTeX macros for page formatting--Prof Chappell recommends installing the MikTeX LaTeX distribution. Modifying the Pandoc LaTeX template is unnecessary (though I have done this to avoid repetition): add LaTeX packages and macros to the Markdown document template as needed.
The setup is interesting and will get you part of the way to a Zettelkasten with VSCode. The installed software and workflow are compatible with Zettlr and Obsidian, though this requires additional configuration.</span>

                              <span>Funnily enough, not unlike another recent poster here, my first &quot;serious&quot; Haskell project that I recently finished is an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, this time not with a variable board size but an implementation of the minimax algorithm.
 My background is not in OOP but the thing I have been struggling most with in Haskell is file organization (It just never feels &quot;right&quot; to me, not sure why) and just difficulties getting around the tooling but now that I got it set up it just works most of the time.
 Anyways, interested in feedback from experienced Haskell users, especially in code organization and formatting or just general coding tips.
 Also as an added question, after implementing the tree building/traversing functions in Skynet.hs using (un)foldTree instead of explicit recursion, to me atleast, the code doesn&#x27;t seem that much clearer, I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s something that will come with experience or if manual recursion is just the way to go sometimes.

                              <span>Im working through the paper &quot;Structured Handling of Scoped Effects&#x27;&#x27; and on page 13 they introduce an inference rule that looks a lot like Coyoneda, but with two continuations. Translating it into code:
 ​
 data DoubleCoyo : (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Type -&gt; Type
 In : g n -&gt; (n -&gt; p x) -&gt; (x -&gt; p a) -&gt; DoubleCoyo g p a
 ​
 They then say that this is equivalent to a left kan extension Lan Id (Comp g p) (p a), and since Lan Id &#x3D; Coyoneda, this is the same thing as Coyoneda (Comp g p) (p a).
 ​
 However, I am stuck trying to show that the two types are equivalent. Am I on the right track, or did I make a mistake somewhere?

                              <span>Today, I am very excited to announce the 1.0 release of Nickel.
A bit more than one year ago, we released the very first public version Nickel
(0.1). Throughout various
write-ups and public talks
(1,
2,
3), we’ve been telling the
story of our dissatisfaction with the state of configuration management.

The need for a New Deal
Configuration is everywhere. The manifest of a web app, the configuration of an
Apache virtual host, an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) cloud deployment
(Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.).
Configuration is more often than not considered a second-class engineering
discipline, like a side activity of software engineering. That’s a dangerous
mistake: with the advent of IaC for the cloud, configuration has become an
important aspect of modern software systems, and a critical poin…</span>

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 The Scala tooling is a common complain within the community, lately, we have been lucky to get more and better tools, like scala-cli, metals, etc.
 Time ago, I had to do some work with js where I was able to try Vercel/Netlify, those tools are super handy, for example, Vercel allows to deploy js projects that use next.js with minimal effort, also, it provides Preview Environments to each Pull Request, this is something that I really wanted to get in Scala.
 Last year I started building a similar tool (https://codepreview.io), as of now, it only supports Preview Environments, still, different to Vercel, codepreview actually let&#x27;s you try the whole application, imagine a scala backend, scala.js frontend, postgres database, all of them packaged as a temporal app on every Pull Request (with it&#x27;s unique domain).
 It&#x27;s been a few months since we have been using codepreview on internal projects + a few customer projects, so far, the feedback has been good.
 Unfortunately, the project isn&#x27;t as nice as Vercel, it would be lovely to get this installed with a few clicks like Vercel does, instead, I need to do a few manual steps for every project. Besides this, there are also some other improvements to make but I&#x27;m not fully confident on what to prioritize. Which is why I&#x27;m coming here to ask for help.
 My offering is, I&#x27;ll grant a trial/free license to whoever is willing to give codepreview a try, I&#x27;d only ask for feedback, which should help me to prioritize the future work.
 So far, we have been working mainly with projects that use https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager, still, projects building fat jars should also work smoothly.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Some context:
 This is simple agenda view where we can select heading for the future bulk action:
 Column mode disabled, marks visible
 I use my special columned agenda view to archive some done headings. (I need columns to see &#x60;CLOSED&#x60; timestamps.)
 I still can mark/unmark items, but I have to do that blindly.
 Column mode enabled, marks invisible
 I&#x27;ve configured it in this way:
 (org-agenda-overriding-columns-format &quot;%CATEGORY %30ITEM %TODO %CLOSED %TAGS&quot;) 
 (I also tried a default column set.)
 Is it a fundamental limitation or a configured feature?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Before anything, i&#x27;d like to let you know that I&#x27;m pretty new to emacs (and loving it). 
 So what I&#x27;m trying to achieve is what title says, develop on a remote machine, I&#x27;m using TRAMP to connect to remote machine, but then I&#x27;ve no &quot;IDE&quot; features like, auto-completion, debugging, executing the code. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried to setup the lsp mode, without success. 
 I&#x27;m really sorry for this noob alike post, but there&#x27;s not much more info I can provide, i&#x27;m kinda lost atm. Is there any chance that you can give me some guidance that I can follow to make it to work? 
 Thanks alot for your time

Or is there a better way to profile Emacs&#x27; start-up woes these days?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am using emacs 28 on Windows 10, and since 1 week or two, I sometimes get a message in a Windows window indicating that emacs is crashing, and offering to debug or not.
  
emacs is crashing, would you like to open a Debugger?
  
https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/vg4GLXZmLP9q
 When I choose to debug, a stacktrace is written in a locally saved txt file. Why this message and not a warning within emacs (debug on error is set to true) ?
 How can I get rid of it? Thanks for your help,

 Is there a way to hide dates which have no actions in Super agenda mode?
 As I&#x27;m trying to set actions more into the future, I get quite a long list of empty dates before I get to one particular action, which is not ideal

                              <span>hi everybody,
 I wonder... why is using javascript injection NOT a common method to retrieve the URL, title and selection inside a web-page? Here is a simple AppleScript that does that. it would be trivial to write a function that calls this script, parses the output and is used by the user in whichever way wanted.
  #!/usr/bin/env osascript set jsCommand to &quot;console.log( &#x27;get url,title&#x27; );document.URL + &#x27;;;&#x27; + document.title + &#x27;;;&#x27; + window.getSelection().toString();&quot; tell application &quot;Google Chrome&quot; execute front window&#x27;s active tab javascript jsCommand end tell 
 I realize that using AppleScript only works on MacOS. But there must be a way to do it in other platforms. This seems to be a way more practical way to retrieve this info than starting an org-capture from the browser.

                              <span>Observed this in emacs 28.1
 Thought it would be some issue with my config
 ran with emacs -Q, still not opening org files 
 even a new file with C-x C-f filename.org also not opening
 
 Uninstalled and reinstalled emacs 28.2 and tried without config, same behavior
  
It consumed a lot of time, trying to resolve. Did anyone face this? I am with no clue and it is so weird. Am I missing any simple thing? Btw, I started learning emacs recently, only for ORG mode :(
 Edit: Do not know if this is related, I observed this after I started using XMonad window manager. I uninstalled, and installed in GNOME, KDE Plasma DEs also without configuration, but no luck.
 (Org files are opening in Macbook)

                              <span>How can I print symbols in emacs lisp, preserving the quotes?
 For example:
 (prin1-to-string (quote foo)) ;; &quot;foo&quot; (print1-to-string #&#x27;insert) ;; &quot;insert&quot; (prin1-to-string #&#x27;insert nil &#x27;((quoted . t))) ;; &quot;insert&quot; 
 Instead of &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;insert&quot; I would like it to print &quot;&#x27;foo&quot; and &quot;#&#x27;insert&quot;. According to the info manual it seems like it should print the quoting characters, but it does not.
 I am using Emacs 29.0.91 (Emacs 29 2nd pretest).

Should I install a snippet engine such as &quot;tempel&quot; or &quot;yasnippet&quot;?
 Do I need company as I have seen people install it alongside corfu and cape?
  
note: I already have Cape set up, and lsp completions are functioning—they&#x27;re just not expanding.

 I&#x27;ve read a lot of posts that it should be much faster. Is there problem in jit flag on or it is problem with my environment?

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;m trying to get my computers to where they&#x27;ll all seamlessly synchronize all my files between them, mostly my PKMS files. I&#x27;m quite new to Emacs and I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m making a mistake here.
 I have a directory &#x60;~/kb/~ which contains all of my notes. Yesterday I set up Syncthing to synchronize that folder between all of my computers. Eventually I&#x27;d like for changed files to auto-reload in Emacs if they&#x27;re open in a buffer, but for now I&#x27;m fine with just synchronizing them and manually reopening them.
 Here&#x27;s the relevant bit of my init.el  (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/kb&quot;)) (org-roam-db-location (concat org-roam-directory &quot;/org-roam.db&quot;)))  As you can see, org-roam.db is stored in ~/kb, which is synchronized. I&#x27;m wondering if this will have any adverse affects?

                              <span>I have the following function:
 (defun wm-focus (direction) (condition-case nil (windmove-do-window-select direction) (error (shell-command (format &quot;sway focus %s&quot; direction) t)))) 
 The problem is, this function does not work initially. I have to create a new window and run evil-window-down or evil-window-up or windmove-up etc, and only then it starts working.
 I have isolated the problem but I do not know how to solve it.
 If I start Emacs daemon and I run this:
 (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down) 
 I get this error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function windmove-do-window-select) (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down) (progn (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down)) eval((progn (windmove-do-window-select &#x27;down)) t) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) call-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 But if I do the trick with manual switching of the windows, then the error disappears.
 The funny thing is that I cannot even find (C-h f) the windmove-do-window-select until I perform the manual creation and switching of the windows. But I can find windmove-up. Yet, both functions are declared inside windmove.el.
 What is going on here? :/
 SOLVED: Found the solution on the Emacs wiki:
 https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindMove
 I needed to add this bit to my configuration:
 (when (fboundp &#x27;windmove-default-keybindings) (windmove-default-keybindings)) 
 This adds the default bindings and includes all the functions properly.

 So I apologize in advance if this question is premised on poor understandings of emacs / LSP.
 ​
 Anyway, I&#x27;ve set it up as a web development environment. I&#x27;ve managed to get LSP working for js/jsx.
 LSP provides autocomplete functionality: once I start typing out a js keyword, LSP gives me completion candidates. Things look like this:
 https://i.imgur.com/4heaW4J.png
 What you can see *beneath* the list of LSP auto-completion candidates is a list of candidates produced by auto-complete-mode. 
 So if I hit &#x27;tab&#x27;, I get completion for the auto-complete-mode candidate. Not the currently-selected LSP candidate. 
 This is frustrating as hell. I can work around it manually, but that adds a cognitive tax that I&#x27;d rather live without. 
 Now, I could disable auto-complete-mode. But then I&#x27;d lose the capacity to get auto-completion on other strings. 
 Is there a way to get auto-complete-mode to stand down if a candidate list from LSP is being presented?

                              <span>Can someone point me to some nice examples to use pseudo random numbers in not-the-most trivial of examples - like those I find online?
 (I actually really love getting rid of IO! Really neat ideas)
 I can use &#x60;State&#x60; successfully within a basic function, but should I try to compose various separate random functions together and &#x60;runState&#x60; over them? Seems tricky at first glance.
 Perhaps I need to look harder at this: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/State#Handling_Combined_States
 I have also &#x60;split&#x60; generators, so each function is called with its own, which works, but doesn&#x27;t look the most elegant.

                              <span>Hey guys, i finished writing my first &quot;real&quot; program in haskell. A simple (and maybe a bit overengineered) tic tac toe game for two players with variable board size. I would love to get some feedback from you guys, because i am unsure about some things.
  
Coming from an OOP background i tend to seperate code in individual files, ive seen others putting the whole program in the Main.hs or at least a huge chunk of it. Which approach is preferred, or does it even matter?
 
I represented a valid move with the &quot;Move&quot; datatype. What bugs me is that i can still generate a &quot;Move&quot; with invalid coordinates, is there a way to make it stricter / safer. I think about F# having private constructors etc.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have two questions about thunks. Please help me understand them.
 Question 1: The wikibook says that: in this expression
  let z &#x3D; (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;) in ... 
 z is a thunk.
 But stackoverflow says that the outermost layer of z is the data constructor (,), which is in WHNF, thus z is not a thunk.
 So which one is right? I tried this on GHCi
 ghci&gt; z &#x3D; (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;) ghci&gt; :sprint z z &#x3D; (_,_) 
 and see that z is not a thunk, only its components are.
 Question 2: Both 1 and &quot;hello&quot; are in normal form, thus are not thunks. So why does GHCi show that &quot;hello&quot; is a thunk?
 ghci&gt; x &#x3D; 1::Int ghci&gt; :sprint x x &#x3D; 1 ghci&gt; x &#x3D; &quot;hello&quot;::String ghci&gt; :sprint x x &#x3D; _ 
 Edit: I posted the same questions on StackOverflow

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling with finding a way to combine pipes in such a way that I can send a stream of &#x27;t&#x27; in, have it passed to all the pipes, and get a stream of &#x27;t&#x27; out. I&#x27;m guessing the type would look something like this
  foo :: Traversable f &#x3D;&gt; f (Pipe a b m r) -&gt; Pipe a b m (f r) 
 the resulting stream should have values from all combined pipes interleaved, i.e. something like this
  main :: IO () main &#x3D; do P.runEffect $ numberProd &gt;-&gt; (foo [evens, double]) &gt;-&gt; P.print where numberProd &#x3D; P.each [1 .. 5] double &#x3D; P.map (* 2) evens &#x3D; P.filter even 
 should produce this (without the added explanation)
  2 -- double of 1 2 -- evens of 2 4 -- double of 2 6 -- double of 3 4 -- evens of 4 8 -- double of 4 10 -- double of 5 
 Am I missing some way of doing this that&#x27;s so obvious that no one has written about it?
 Oh, yes, I am aware of conduit&#x27;s support for this but at this point the project is fairly heavily invested in pipes and switching to conduit isn&#x27;t really an option.

However, I cannot for the life of me figure out a way to get stack to recognize them. I’ve tried every stack setup guide I can find and even tried restarting my project from scratch. The my-Haskell-app.cabal file does seem to recognize my library as exposed modules, but they are not built or recognized by the compiler. I always get “no known library or package” in the code editor and they never compile. I’m newer to coding with Haskell and I posted a few days ago (which helped solve my problem btw). I don’t intend to spam this this subreddit lol but I’ve tried everything and so this was my last remaining option. Thanks!

                              <span>I remember seeing a post or a video once explaining how to switch the minibuffer command without exiting the minibuffer but for the life of me I can&#x27;t remember how to do it or which package provided that functionality. For example, say I&#x27;m running consult-line and I&#x27;ve entered a string which is being completed by Vertico, and then I decide I&#x27;d rather use consult-imenu - is there a way to switch commands without exiting the minibuffer and having to retype the search term?

                              <span>Hello all, I was playing with adding holidays to calendar-holidays and I suddenly remembered, a long long time ago, I used to have configured in my emacs on a long-gone system, something where diary entries from the Lord of the Rings timeline would show in calendar/diary. Something like &quot;Fellowship leaves Rivendell&quot; on such-and-such a day. Does this strike a bell with anyone? Is there something out there to add this to my diary?

 I am trying to have something (like systemd or a bash script) that whenever I want to run emacs I got an instant shell.I know that emacsclient -c -a&#x3D;&quot;&quot; $* works out of the box but some configs are not the same as my init.el states.
 Wanted to know what you guys do to be able to run emacs faster!
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, I have the following problem:
 When I use gnome-console the &quot;shift&quot; button is already bound for console shortcuts and especially using org-mode this is nasty.
 Being flexible I decided to use the virtual console instead but to my pure horror I figured that &quot;alt + arrow keys&quot; is already bound for switching from one tty to the next.
 How can I get rid of all those keybindings? I have no use for tabs or whatever.
 System information: I run Arch Linux and use zsh.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Today, 2023-05-15, at 1830 UTC (11:30 am PDT, 2:30 pm EDT, 7:30 pm BST, 20:30 CEST, …) we are streaming the third episode of the Haskell Unfolder live on YouTube:
 https://www.youtube.com/live/1vd9mvH8Bos?feature&#x3D;share
 In this episode, we will discuss in what way parameterised datatypes are injective and type families are not. For this episode, we assume familiarity with Haskell fundamentals, in particular datatypes. Knowledge of type families is certainly helpful, but not required.
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. The playlist containing all episodes so far is here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes: https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src&#x3D;c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a few years out of any haskell development and trying to understand how it&#x27;s now done.
 When I wanted an extension for a library I was using in my cabal project, I could develop a patch for the library and test it with my project by adding it with &#x27;cabal sandbox add-source&#x27;.
 Is there a way to achieve something similar now?

 Is there a library for that?

                              <span>I had the opportunity to update some Scala programs from the 2.x series and ZIO 1.x serios to scala3 and the latest zio2 libraries. These are department-level applications, some processing work queues and others with a react UI (or both). They were written for both JVM and JS platforms and used scala for jvm and js. I also updated a front-end, data ingest process due to customer environment changes. These are not high-performance systems, just things that need to work with little maintenance. One of the scala servers worked for 3 years with only 1 restart, so that&#x27;s not too bad. Everything is cloud-deployed, and there are only 3-4 significant data integrations, so reasonably simple use cases.
 Generally, on scala and zio:

                              <span>Hello!
 As I&#x27;m sure many of you also have had, I am having trouble with key bindings.
 Emacs packages define many keybindings, and I&#x27;d like to use some of them, but also I would like to be able to define my own, which have higher precedence.
 My ideal setup would have the following order of precedence for bindings (most to least):
  
Bindings I define for specific mode.
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run command X in org-mode.
 
 
Bindings I define globally for all other modes.
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run command Y all modes except org-mode because I previously defined it to run command X.
 
 
Bindings I didn&#x27;t define for specific modes.
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run whatever is in org-mode-map for &quot;C-c a&quot;
 
 
Bindings I didn&#x27;t define globally for all other modes
  
e.g &quot;C-c a&quot; should run whatever its globally bound for by default.
 
  
To achieve this I was thinking I need to create my own minor modes with their own keymaps for each mode I define a binding for. (my-org-mode mode with a keymap containing &quot;C-c a&quot;). I can add a hook for org-mode to also enable my-org-mode, and on change-major-mode hook to disable my-org-mode.
 Then I could make this mode have higher precedence than org-mode using &#x27;emulation-mode-map-alists. (Basically what this is saying but for every mode I define bindings for)
 Could do the same for a &quot;global map&quot; that will have lower precedence than the mode-specific ones.
 Then for the bindings I don&#x27;t define it should &quot;just work&quot;.
 Is this a decent idea for trying to achieve what I want or am I way overcomplicating this?
 Also are there any packages that could help me do this or do I have to code it up myself. I don&#x27;t mind coding it but would like to save some time.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi, a small theory question:
 traverse when specialized to monads looks like:
 traverse :: (Traversable t, Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; t a -&gt; m (t b) 
 which is the shape of an endofunctor in the Kleisli category. The corresponding functor laws are:
 traverse pure &#x3D; pure -- purity law traverse (f &lt;&#x3D;&lt; g) &#x3D; traverse f &lt;&#x3D;&lt; traverse g 
 The paper An Investigation of the Laws of Traversals proves the latter law, but only when the monad is commutative, which suggests that this doesn&#x27;t hold in general. What would a counterexample look like? Does this mean that the type of mapM is very slightly too general?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out whether it&#x27;s possible to tell from Haddock documentation whether a given data type is a distinct type with the same name or a re-export of a type defined in another module.
 For example, if I search for IO on Hoogle, the result for data IO a points to many different modules, e.g. the Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude module from the hedgehog package: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-1.2/docs/Hedgehog-Internal-Prelude.html#t:IO. As far as I can see, there is no way to tell, from the docs alone, that this type is a re-export of Prelude.IO. However, this must be the case since the following code typechecks:
 import qualified Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude test1 :: Hedgehog.Internal.Prelude.IO () test1 &#x3D; (pure () :: Prelude.IO ()) 
 If I, on the other hand, search for e.g. Query on Hoogle, I will get lots of data types called Query that are not the same, ie. not re-exports. For example:
  
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.6.5/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#t:Query
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-0.24/docs/Aws-DynamoDb-Commands-Query.html#t:Query
  
Which means that the following will not typecheck:
 import qualified Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query import qualified Database.PostgreSQL.Simple test2 :: Aws.DynamoDb.Commands.Query.Query test2 &#x3D; (undefined :: Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Query) 
 Hence my question: given the Haddocks for two datatypes with the same name, is there a way to tell if they&#x27;re the same?

                              <span>I wrote this repo a while ago and publish it on discourse, but maybe reddit is also a good place to promote it.
 The repo tries to be a &quot;challenge&quot; for people learning haskell, rather than a tutorial. You are given a series of function to implement and you end up with a working snake game. Then you are introduce to monad via refactors instead of via example.
 I think is a good resource since it goes directly into building something instead of teaching recursion, pattern matching, etc... Which is a much funnier approach, although the challengers are expected to learn that by themself (via other resources). The README.md has more information about it.

Just finished Learn You a Haskell and I&#x27;m trying to code a small simulation program that uses a two dimensional array containing a &quot;Cell&quot; datatype. I&#x27;m trying to create a simple function &#x27;&#x27;baseArray&#x27; that creates an empty array of cells based on the desired x and y size. It&#x27;s supposed to return a type &#x27;CellArray&#x27; that I have provided the definition for below. Please note that I haven&#x27;t finished the function definition for all cases because I can&#x27;t get the compiler to understand the first two. It keeps giving all sorts of trouble about not matching up with the given type signature. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of combinations. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Here is the code:
 type CellArray &#x3D; A.Array ((Int, Int),(XSize, YSize)) [((Int, Int) , Cell)] baseArray :: XSize -&gt; YSize -&gt; CellArray baseArray 0 0 &#x3D; A.array ((0,0),(0,0)) [((0,0),Cell 0 0 Nothing)] baseArray 0 y &#x3D; A.array ((0,0),(0,y)) [((0,i), Cell 0 i Nothing) | i&lt;-[1..y]]

                              <span>The standard way to map Haskell to category theory is to use the category Hask, where objects represent types, and arrows represent functions between types. It&#x27;s known that this is an approximation - for example, it ignores bottom values. But I want to talk about another way in which it fails to match the Haskell type system.
 In Hask, we can talk about an object representing Int, one representing Bool, one representing (Int, Bool), one representing Either Int Bool, etc.
 However, this only handles the structural types in Haskell. Haskell allows you to declare nominal types, e.g. newtype Age &#x3D; Age Int or newtype Count &#x3D; Count Int. Now those two types should be represented by distinct objects in Hask. There is, of course, an isomorphism between them.
 But how would one distinguish which one is which?
 If we want to represent all possible Haskell types, should we have an infinite number of objects structurally equivalent to Int, because each one could represent a different possible name?
 One approach would be to define Haskell types as pairs of objects from Hask with objects in a separate category of names.
 But then how would you enforce the fact that one name can be used for at most one type? You could end up with the same name being paired with two different types.

 What I cannot (it really frustrates me), I cannot figure out how to make hyperlink between 2 different posts. I&#x27;m currently using the 1subtree&#x3D;1post paradigm. 
  
Linking with the (org-copy-id) within single post works without any issue.
 However, this appears not to work if I referencing to another post (ie. another subtree with different md export).
  
Am I doing something wrong? How do I make hyperlink to different posts?
  
Update:
 I just figured out how to use relref or ref:
 From here: I&#x27;ve been copying following code:
  This links to the @@hugo:[Org Special Blocks]({​{}})@@ page. 
 However, in actuality there is invisible character  between {{ which was causing problem.
  This links to the @@hugo:[Org Special Blocks]({{}})@@ page.  With this I can make the linking. 
  
Yet however, I&#x27;d still love to use org-copy-id if possible. If you know how to do it please let me know. org-id is much better when I export to LaTeX PDF in the future

 This seems particularly useful for a subset of messages that are currently sent to the minibuffer (flymake/flycheck info, whether compilation completed, etc.). While messages sent the the minibuffer are certainly sufficient for this, I find that I often miss them when focused. I feel like having what amounts to a popup notification would capture my attention without being frustratingly noise (like using message-box, for example).
 I&#x27;ve looked around for a similar package for emacs, but have come up empty. Does anybody know of any good options off of the top of their head?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have an issue with what I believe is caused by Corfu. As seen in the first screenshot, corfu cuts off all hits at roughly 1.5. Poor example since it’s only 2 results in the list but it remains the same nonetheless. 
 As seen in the second screenshot, company mode works just as expected. 
 The config for corfu is the following. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;corfu) (require &#x27;kind-icon)
 (setq corfu-cycle t) (setq corfu-auto t) ;; (setq corfu-auto-prefix 1) (setq corfu-auto-delay 0.0) (setq corfu-echo-delay 0.0) (setq corfu-popupinfo-delay 0.0) (setq corfu-count 10) (setq corfu-scroll-margin 5) (setq corfu-echo-documentation nil)
 (defun my/enable-corfu () &quot;Enable Corfu mode on prog-mode hooks&quot; (corfu-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;my/enable-corfu)
 (add-hook &#x27;corfu-mode-hook #&#x27;corfu-popupinfo-mode)
 (setq tab-always-indent &#x27;complete)
 (setq kind-icon-use-icons t) (setq kind-icon-default-face &#x27;corfu-default) (setq kind-icon-blend-background nil) (setq kind-icon-blend-frac 0.08) (add-to-list &#x27;corfu-margin-formatters #&#x27;kind-icon-margin-formatter) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to automate the creation of the font name (e.g., &quot;IBM Plex Mono-14&quot;) by concatenating two strings (e.g., &quot;IBM Plex Mono-&quot; and &quot;14&quot;) based on the computer I&#x27;m using and adding this to my init file. I thought using a comma to escape the backquote would do the trick but I get an &quot;invalid font&quot; error. Can anyone tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong or why it won&#x27;t work?

 A few excerpts:
  
Software freedom has hitherto been framed in terms of legal requirements, as a means of bending copyright law to forward the needs of the user. The intent is to empower those who run the program to operate aloof from the influence of the program’s creator or distributor. While the repurposing of copyright law is fecund, the emphasis on code alone remains limited in scope and thus unambitious in outlook. The target audience is necessarily restricted to a nucleus of enthusiasts who are more or less inclined to tinker with the program. Everybody else is relegated to the status of a “normal user”, else “normie”. [...]
 Compassion is key in dismantling those barriers to entry. All code should be…</span>

                              <span>My current job uses a complete Typescript stack, (Node backend, React and custom framework for the frontend). I&#x27;m already using Typescript mode and lsp-mode for auto completion, and I&#x27;m using eslint from VSCode to catch errors. 
 ​
 There are still some snags I&#x27;m running into. First, I would like some kind of autoimport for components. I know VSCode does this somehow, but I&#x27;m not sure what package or configuration could bring this functionality into Emacs. 
 Second, a lot of files I work on are over 1,000 lines of code and it is causing lsp-mode to freeze. Is there a way to improve lsp-mode&#x27;s performance?

                              <span>I have some commercial experience as a java developer, but due to the war kinda jobless right now. 
 Current job market where I live is: - java is dead for juniors - C# is taking over spots for juniors - 1-2 junior scala dev jobs per month with almost no competition.
 Honestly, I would like to ditch JVM as .net seems like the most optimal solution for now, but I am still considering to go with scala.
 The reason for that is that I really love functional programming. I would prefer haskell job, but yeah it is non existing in my country. 
 I am not that interested in big data, more in overall backend development / problem solving
 Is it hard to find a job as a scala (zio/cats) developer?
 And what is the state of the language? I saw a lot of messages in this community that scala is dead/diying/dreaded. Local folks in my country just tells the same.

                              <span>Jam - an incredibly simple DI Scala library.
 jam-monad module provides Reval monad that encodes the idea of allocating an object which has an associated finalizer. Can be thought of as a mix of cats.effect.Resource and cats.Eval. It can be useful in cases when you need to control an object lifecycle: how many times the object should be allocated, when it should be allocated and how it should be closed. In the combination with jam-cats it should cover most DI cases. More info and examples can be found here: https://github.com/yakivy/jam#reval-monad

                              <span>Usually org-mode manual is pretty exhaustive and very useful source of information. However it doesn’t offer an exhaustive list of all build-in properties, nor detail if and in what form they can be overwritten by user, and what happens if user so does anyway.
 This kind of list is the exact thing I am trying to parse together for myself. My current strategy is using the add propety function which lists all available properties, the Reserved Properties -listing under Properties section, which offers a glossary explanation of individual properties, and searching the Index for word ‘Property’, and once I find a new link, I visit it and hopefully find other properties near it.
 However, this is pretty slow way to gather the list, and it doesn’t really distinguish between useful properties, properties user can use if they want, and system-breaking properties.
 Usually better documentation is written in the relevant chapter of the manual, if the property is intended to be used.
 Has anyone written about this online? I found some youtube videos discussing some of the properties related to clocking, but generally it seems this information is written from the opposite direction from my approach: from usecase to property, not from property to usecase.
 I don’t have any good reasoning behind wanting this information. I just want to write it down in my notes, and while doing it gain some insight into org-mode as a system.
 What I mean by system breaking is something like CLOCKSUM_T. I haven’t yet tested the behaviour, but as this is used to calculate todays clocked time for a heading and it’s children, it is very clear that either the users input is overwritten, or the clocksum is inaccurate. This might not be strictly system-breaking, but neither does it make sense inside the system.

 If you find an under-maintained Haskell package which is useful but just needs a little freshening up, you generally have two good options.
  
Submit a PR and pester the maintainer to publish a new version. Then next year another person who wants to use the package will have to repeat this process.
 Ask to become a maintainer. Then next year another person who wants to use the package will pester you.
  
The Haskell GitHub Trust gives you a third option: 
  
Add the package to the Haskell Github Trust.
  
All Trust Owners can publish any package in the Trust. It’s easy to become a Trust Owner if you have any reputation at all in the Haskell community.

                              <span>I like the org agenda log where you can see what you did in the past few days, as a list of days with log events under each day. So far, I have managed to get it to work on the basis of state changes on todo items (DOING -&gt; DONE, etc). 
 Would it be possible to include &quot;todo item creation events&quot; in such a log? That is, not base the selector on a state change in existings item, but rather the creation of new todo items? That could be useful reminder and summary of what you added recently.

If anyone wants to help me turn this into an actual elisp function, be my guest. I&#x27;m waiting for the author of gptel to un-jank the hard coded queries so I can just use the existing transient menu, etc. 
 This prompt is something I came up with while taking notes. I wanted my literature notes to be easily linked via ideas. And I wanted GPT to extract them so i did not have to type them. I want to make this into a function so that I can use org-roam-db-query to grab a list of existing tags to give chat gpt existing selections to choose among.
 Prompt:
 You are an emacs plugin. You analyze generic text that may be pure prose or a mix of prose and code. After analysis you recommend 5 filetags for the file to assist with organization and search. create more abstract tags that cultivate the connections between ideas.
 ​
 You must print all recommended tags in a single code block.
 You must use the following output formatting:
 Example:
 Input Ideas: Research and Writing
 Output tags: #+filetags: :research:writing

                              <span>I over-rely on org-super-agenda as a dashboard for running my life and radar for upcomings. 
 So, as an example, three entries right now.  In 4d.: TODO Invoice customer x In 17d.: Nephew&#x27;s Birthday&#x60; (3/15): Stay at Hotel Y&#x60; (taken from my google calendar) 
 One thing that would have been super useful recently was to be able to display was number of days elapsed from a particular date, so for example:
 [Day 15] Arrived in Country X
 Also would have been super useful if I could create a heading like that with an upper limit on something:
 [15/30] Country X Visa on Arrival
 (I did the last with a calendar entry previously, but it&#x27;s not really where it belongs)
 Is there a org-feature or package which supports that in some easy way (really basically a days elapsed kind of thing.)
 Apologies if this is an obvious one. My google fu seemed not to be able to find a way to support this in org agenda.
 thanks!

                              <span>It feels like the barrier to contribute to Haskell-the-language is significantly too high these days, and that being perfect gets in the way of getting things done. Personally, I feel much less inspired to be involved, because even modest changes require a huge amount of make-work on top of the actual labor involved to make the change.
 Thus why I&#x27;m writing this as a reddit post rather than going through the proposal process---if anyone is inspired by these, please feel free to take the ball and run with it!
  
Meta-issues aside, proposal #165 was just announced here, wanting to add an obviously-good function to base. Why does this have to be a proposal, instead of just a PR? There are the &quot;how should we implement this function&quot; concerns, which a PR can tackle, and then the &quot;let&#x27;s make sure we don&#x27;t break every downstream user.&quot;
 The latter is the concern of the community, but it ought not be; why don&#x27;t we just add compiler support to prevent this from happening? Thus, my proposal:
 GHC should not emit ambiguous usage errors for functions that shadow ones defined in base. Instead, just use the non-base one, emit a warning saying &quot;hey, sorry!&quot; and be done with it. If you want the current behavior, promote the warning to an error via -Werror&#x3D;....
 Now we can freely add to base without requiring any would-be contributor to build all of stackage and perform a breakage analysis.

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;ve been working on this for the past three months or so.
 Honestly I&#x27;m pretty nervous to share it here because it&#x27;s pretty imperative, ugly Haskell compared to a lot of what gets shared and discussed here--it uses a basic ReaderT pattern with a lot of mucking about with STM values--and it still has a ton of corner cases not being handled, probably a bunch of dumb code and bugs I&#x27;m clueless about, etc. etc. (I miss PR reviews when working solo). But, that&#x27;s probably not going to change any time soon. Even still, I&#x27;m pretty happy with how it&#x27;s working for me, and if even one other person gets something out of it I&#x27;ll be psyched.

 I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback you have.
 More to the point, I&#x27;ve been hanging out in the Haskell community and on this subreddit in particular for a while, and I wanted to share this thing I&#x27;ve been working on because so much of it is due to the help I&#x27;ve received here, the great posts folks have shared here, the amazing random comments containing deep wisdom or cool information or essential practical advice I&#x27;ve found here...etc. I have so much respect and admiration for so many in the Haskell community and I feel lucky to be able to participate here at all. Thank you all for checking this out and for being a great community, one I hope to be a part of for a while.
 Special shoutout to https://github.com/tarleb for HsLua, which is really cool and which more people should be using! Also thanks to my former CV colleagues who helped me grow so much in my Haskell and PureScript skills, if any of you see this.

                              <span>This is based on a conversation I had with my manager with the null value. Both of us dislike it, and in Haskell there’s the Maybe type to deal with this.
 But let’s say I need to write some values into a database, and this null that I observe is normally an integer or floating point value. What could I convert Nothing to, when writing my data to persistent storage (for example the price of a product that’s null, or regional temperature taken from an API)?

I have Mason and lspconfig installed, and HLS installed within Mason, but when I open up any .hs file I get the error:
 Client 1 quit with exit code 1 and signal 0 
 No warnings are shown anywhere in the file, I can ctrl+k to hover on certain keywords like &#x27;import&#x27; and the &#x27;System&#x27; module and it&#x27;ll pop up an information box, but trying to hover on any variable results in the error:
 man.lua: &quot;no manual entry for groupCalories&quot; 
 where groupCalories is a function I defined. I see people mentioning their lsp&#x27;s working great all over reddit, and I cannot find anyone with this problem. Am I going about this all wrong?

                              <span>Let me preface this with, I&#x27;m not new to emacs or projectile. I just started a new job, and they do development on remote workstations. No big deal, I&#x27;ve worked 100% over tramp before. But, I set up projectile to find my remote project, and while it loads the project, and Messages tells me its caching files, I have no files found, ie projectile-find-file has nothing to choose from, nothing gets completed. I&#x27;ve never seen projectile do this before, and I&#x27;m not sure how to debug it. Can you get a log from the cache population? The project is in a git repo that seems to be detected otherwise. Also, this is emacs-plus@29 on a mac, accessing a Linux workstation over tramp/ssh. Accessing local repos on the mac seems to work the way its supposed to.

 Misc 
  
For stuff like notes, I&#x27;d like to have numbered and indented headlines, serif fonts, etc..

 How can I achieve such thing?

                              <span>I want to be able to run my c++ code by a key like f5, then have emacs split the screen, run eshell in it, and type &quot;g++ /path/to/file -o /path/to/output &amp;&amp; /path/to/output&quot; so it would execute my code. I can write the part to make the command string but I can&#x27;t write the part which emacs would split the window, the run eshell in it, and run the command string in it. How can I do that?
 I have already tried quickrun for running my c++ code inside emacs but it&#x27;s pretty buggy and sometimes need emacs to restart to be able to work again.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a problem with the mini-frame with gnome-shell.
 The mini-frame&#x27;s frame don&#x27;t disappear when I close the minibuffer.
 It&#x27;s a resize problem if I read well but the fix don&#x27;t work for me.

 Could you fix it ?

                              <span>Hi, Im on macos, and I&#x27;ve just downloaded both emacs and doom emacs. So when I type emacs in terminal or open emacs.app, doom emacs open up. However, I want to use both vanilla and doom emacs simultaneously but with different configs, settings... like 2 seperate apps. Is there any ways to handle this? 
 (I tried emacs -q but that just open a vanilla emacs scratch and I can&#x27;t configure any configs)
 Thank you so much.

                              <span>We are using Scala 3 with ZIO, and I am really pleased with the language and libraries. I have a question for others regarding debugging though. We moved from IntelliJ to VSCode + Metals a while back because of the lack of Scala 3 support in IntelliJ. But I&#x27;m having serious problems with the debugger, to me it&#x27;s nearly worthless. It can&#x27;t do the simplest things, like just step over code, it jumps to what feel like totally random places deep in the ZIO codebase. The only way I can get it to sometimes work is by using {} brackets so that I can put pure Scala code, no ZIO&#x27;s, on their own lines, and only break there. Then run from break point to break point, stepping is essentially useless.
 Is it just me, or are others having the same experience? Any good tips, or workarounds? Has IntelliJ started to catch up with Scala 3 support? I feel like the ZIO developers that I watch on Youtube, who are total programming studs, would not tolerate such a bad debugging experience.
 That&#x27;s a lot of questions, thanks to anybody that has good tips.

 In this article they explain why they decided to move away from python (which is a rare case AFAIK ).

                              <span>Recently I have been looking at alternatives to Unity3d for gamedev. As part of this I created a very simple hex-based tic-tac-toe game using Scala.js and the 3d library Babylon.js. It also uses Vite.js for quick dev turnaround, Electron.js for native packaging, and ScalablyTyped to create a Babylon.js facade.
 I was quite happy with the result. It was especially nice to program in Scala again (after a long break) and be able to imagine using it for both client and server code. Now I need to consider whether it is right for me, as there are a number of business issues around using Javascript, but at least the technical side seems possible.
 Since there were a few pains getting all the different libraries to play nicely together, I thought the result may be useful to other people. No tutorial, but my notes are in the README and the code is all available on Github. Be aware I am not a Scala expert, but the code works as far as I have tested it.
 I broke the code into a few pieces for libs for possible reuse, or other people to look to for ideas
  
HexTacToe https://github.com/jarrahtech/HexTacToe - the game itself
 kassite https://github.com/jarrahtech/kassite - Scala.js for (hopefully) functionality common to multiple Scala.js/Babylon.js games - currently has tweening and some shader material stuff. No tests yet - need to work on that
 babylonjsfacade https://github.com/jarrahtech/babylonjsfacade - Scala.js facade of Babylon.js 6.2 (generated within the Github project by ScalablyTyped). I made this a separate project so that the others didn&#x27;t need to import and build it (as it is quite large)
  
also a couple of other libs which are less important for demonstrating the technologies:
  
hex https://github.com/jarrahtech/hex - Scala/Scala.js cross-building hex grid library
 jarrah-util https://github.com/jarrahtech/jarrah-util - Scala/Scala.js cross-building common game code/maths lib
  
Hope its helpful for someone else,
 Charles.

                              <span>Having only just found out about Scala recently, one of the things I seem to read everywhere is that Scala&#x27;s popularity is not growing. In fact, some seem to say it is declining, and the numbers might bear that theory out somewhat.
 But most things I&#x27;ve read about the language are absolutely awesome!
 Two of the main problems I have heard are:
  
Too much change. Apparently the leap to Scala 3 was a little rushed and tooling is still catching up. This has left companies with a choice of either using legacy or investing in something that keeps changing.
 Too much power. It almost seems as though the power of Scala is limitless. Most articles I&#x27;ve read list a huge reel of concepts. Some of the ones that I can recognise seem powerful to the point of abusability, like metaprogramming. This also makes the language harder to learn.
  
Potential intervention to address criticisms:
  
A promise to freeze changes to the language and other core parts for a period of, say, three years (exempting bug fixes).
  
What do you think? What would it take to make the Scala market grow?

                              <span>I am looking for some guidance on how to handle the case where sbt doc or publish is failing due to Lombok generated methods not being found. 
 I have a mixed scala and Java project, where the Java sources are using Lombok to generate builders and getters for the classes. The scala sources in turn depend on these sources. 
 Regular compilation succeeds and the project is able to run its main method fine. However, when I attempt to publish, sbt fails at the (Compile / doc) stage due to generated methods not being found. 
 Is there anyway to configure the doc to respect these classes? I guess more generally as well I am curious to learn why the doc is even erroring of compilation is successful

                              <span>Hi,
 for some months I am in the process of designing some HTML Component system for Scala(JS) and have some API things I would like to discuss.
 The basic idea is simple
  
A Component should be immutable
 A Component should assemble itself as a function. This should never fail.
 State is stored in Models. During rendering, Models can lookup the current state of models. Or they can subscribe Models, which will lead to a re-rendering by the Engine.
 During assembly, components can also register events.
 A Component can create sub components (in order to compose)
 The component should know as little as possible from the rendering engine, so that I can swap it. The engine should handle the whole rendering and event handling stuff.
 The assumption is &quot;Browsers are really fast at rendering HTM…</span>

                              <span>Last year, when Akka moved to the BSL, I mentioned that for my use-case (largely, teaching students the ideas behind Concurrency-Oriented Programming and some ideas about streaming) I&#x27;d probably end up writing my own little actors framework. 
 Amdram (named after &quot;amateur dramatics&quot;) is ticking along, with snapshots now up on Sonatype snapshots. MIT licence.
 Slide deck introducing it to students, which follows on from the one on Concurrency Oriented Programming
 (Also both written quickly)
 Amdram is probably &quot;rough as guts&quot; but small enough to have my students doing a little robocode-like assignment with it. The API probably will change a little, but not until after the assignment due date in a couple of weeks.
 Notably, 
  
The return type of message handler of MessageHandler[T] | Unit will probably change to replace Unit with an explicit &quot;keep this behaviour&quot; token, as otherwise it&#x27;s easy to get an odd behaviour putting it into an if. 
 
Some refactoring on what gets bundled into the actor context and whether Actors should remember their execution contexts (at the moment, it feels like there&#x27;s some repetition/overlap in the implicit arguments) 
 
iteratees package is still under development, along with other forms of small streaming packages
 
At the moment, the jsui package is empty. The idea there is to build some veautiful/doctacular widgets to visualise the actors working in realtime

 And I have a constant value called Carrot All the functions from before have carrot as the value that they need to work. It is a data also called Carrot
 How do I declare this function if I want to apply functions in order? And how should I write It?
 So far I thought of foldl (.) Carrot [Break, Add, Delete, Dance] as a option, but is this right?
 I&#x27;m trying to make a endless function composition. Or well, endless if the person wants to spend hours putting functions to do.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have an issue with FFI and I would like to ask you for indications.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a function in C++ with this signature: c++ int f(char* s); 
 And I import it to Haskell. If I understood it&#x27;s like this: hs foreign import ccall &quot;f&quot; _f :: CString -&gt; CInt 
 I need to allocate the CString and it necessarily involve side effects, therefore IO. But I would like to verify if in order to remove the IO I have to use unsafe things.
 The end result should be a wrapper function like this: hs f :: String -&gt; String 
 Thank you very much !

 By the way, I learned OCaml before haskell, so it&#x27;s not totally from beginning.
 For those who are interested in my programming language, codes are at here https://github.com/bzy-debug/uml. Basically it&#x27;s a minimal pure strict functional programming language with lisp like syntax and ML like semantics.
 I&#x27;m very glad that you guys interested in my learning process! Feel free to ask me anything you&#x27;re interested in!

 This was recently was enabled, and is basically considered an experiment. So, love it or hate it, now is a great time to email savannah-hackers-public@gnu.org your thoughts. There&#x27;s also a CTA for someone who wants to hack upstream cgit, maybe to enable (e.g.) a cookie to allow users to turn it off, or a per repository backend knob, or .

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to be able to switch between a couple saved &#x27;layouts&#x27;; a layout being both the window splits, and the buffer _including location_ in each. ie: so if I switch to another saved layout, and then back, its exactly where I left off. Switching between 2 or 3 or more layouts would be awesome.
 No need to save them between emacs sessions, but that could be interesting as well.
 Ideally such concepts as..
 - layout list
 - layout create
 - layout switch
 - layout kill
 I&#x27;ve been fiddling with 0blayout package, which covers most of it. No layout list, but layout-switch with vertico more or less covers it.
 The problem with that one is it doesn&#x27;t seem to save/restore the location for each window..
 ex: If I make a layout which is split into a top and bottom window A and B, with code on top and an org file on bottom, and then switch to some other layout.. and then back, it&#x27;ll prooperly restore the window layout for A and B and bcak to those files... great! HOWEVER, if A and B are the same file, but different locations within it, that doesn&#x27;t work.. both windows A and B will switch to the same file, the same position within it. 
 I guess I could look into saving window layouts to registers and popping around that way, but I was sure there was a more sophisticated way of doing it.
 (I forget if Bufler does this .. I use filetree as my buffer-list replacement, and bufler doesn&#x27;t work well when Tramp with remote sessions are alive.. so I&#x27;ve generally ignored Bufler the last year or two.)
 Thanks for reading :)

                              <span>This is probably going to be stupid simple and I&#x27;ll regret posting, but I can&#x27;t figure out why this elisp errors in the seq-filter. 
 (with-current-buffer (create-file-buffer (expand-file-name &quot;~/desktop/test.org&quot;)) (insert &quot;* Contacts\n** Joe Dirt\n* Configuration&quot;) (goto-char 0) (org-end-of-subtree) (insert &quot;\n\n&quot;) (let* ((contacts &#x27;((:fullname &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;) (:fullname &quot;John Doe&quot;))) (filtered-contacts (seq-filter (lambda (contact) (when-let (name (plist-get contact :fullname)) (not (org-find-exact-headline-in-buffer (plist-get contact :fullname))))) contacts))) (insert (mapconcat (lambda (contact) (format &quot;** %s&quot; (plist-get contact :fullname))) filtered-contacts &quot;\n&quot;)) (buffer-string))) 
 The error message is not: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil which is weird to me because nil is a perfectly valid input for not.
 Because it works fine when in the contacts org file, I&#x27;m assuming this is a buffer issue, but I&#x27;m not sure how to debug

                              <span>For those of you using Python with a language server: do you install the language server (e.g. pyright or pylsp) globally, or in the virtual environment (e.g. as a developer dependency)? Why?
 Personally I am still not sure what I think is better. Installing a language server in each venv seems a bit of overkill, especially since I am always going to use the same language server and the people I work with on Python projects don&#x27;t need the (same) language server (as they use something like VSCode with Pylance). 
 On the other hand, installing the language server in the venv saves me a bit of work creating the relevant config files to ensure they run the commands with the right binary (e.g. I don&#x27;t need to create a mypy.ini files to ensure mypy runs from the venv, nor do I need a pyrightconfig.json to point the server to the venv).
 I found a way to get both pyright and pylsp working on Emacs, whether they are globally installed or installed in the venv. Just curious about how you do it and why!

 I like to use it. Above all the org-mode. This is for me the best IDE. It is really nice to activate layers. The config file is minimalist around just 100 lines compare to lunarvim. But I&#x27;m still facing some issues that I can not solve to allow to use it daily.

 This is the main barrier. It is not easy to debug cpp from my point of view. If you have a good feeling and workflow, please share it.

                              <span>I need a piece of elisp that would return the project name for the buffer at point. Seems simple, right? The problem is, I can&#x27;t find a way to do this reliably. Let me explain.
 If I have a dir structure like this:
 . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── proyecto-tres 
 And the current buffer is readme.org, getting the project name - &#x27;proyecto-uno&#x27; is fairly easy, if you&#x27;re using projectile, you can do (projectile-project-name), right? Alternatively, you can use: (magit-toplevel), which returns full path, i.e., ~/projects/proyecto-uno/ and then you can just grab the last segment.
 Now, it gets tricky when you&#x27;re using git-worktrees and the structure of the project is like this:
 . ├── projects ├── proyecto-uno ├── .git ├── readme.org ├── proyecto-dos ├── .bare ├── master ├── development ├── .git ├── readme2.org ├── proyecto-tres 
 The current buffer is readme2.org. How do you get the project name? (projectile-project-name) returns development (and I want &#x27;proyecto-dos&#x27;). (magit-toplevel) returns full path to &quot;development&quot; dir not to &#x27;proyecto-dos&#x27;. 
 So then you may suggest, why don&#x27;t you check, if the buffer is inside a worktree? And that I don&#x27;t know how to. I assumed I could use (magit-inside-worktree-p), but it always returns t, regardless of where it&#x27;s called from, readme2.org, or from inside &#x27;proyecto-uno&#x27; dir. 
 So how do I find the project name reliably?

 I don&#x27;t really understand how text-encoding works at any level, and I&#x27;m not really a coder, so forgive me if my terminology is a little loose.
 My org-mode files have begun to get infested with strange chararacter codes. I might copy-paste something with a diacritic, and it will be fine until I open the file next and it will show up as &quot;\305\202&quot;, for example. 
 I have a feeling that my files may be composed of different text-encoding systems. Is there a way to harmonize them? How do I go about figuring out what to do?
 Thanks for any help!

 For some reason, WoMan does not render the man pages correctly.
 Any hint?
 Here is the comparison:

                              <span>Since 0.4.0 shipped, I updated the accompanying guide I wrote.
 Since I also updated my screen-capture workflow for video recording (for champagne), it&#x27;s perhaps time to answer some questions about the deepest, darkest corners of building applications with transient.
 On the surface, you can be forgiven for thinking transient is similar to hydra. Without the state juggling and flow control of transient, you cannot make the same level of expressive user interface.
 Some of the topics that get beyond the surface and require thinking about how you would use this software to build applications
  
Flow control
 History &amp; state
 Custom infixes
  
In particular you can also be forgiven for thinking custom infixes are some kind of crazy extensibility without much practical value. This is far from the truth. Attaching complex values to your user input command sentences and quickly modifying any part of these sentences allows you to express a lot of rich commands in a short time. That is the secret to the efficiency of magit, and magit doesn&#x27;t even use very complex flow control. Infix overriding allows your interface to reflect and follow the state of the application.
 I&#x27;m not terribly incentivized to go beyond the showcase, which at worst contains working examples for just about every behavior. It is less complex code than magit and made of examples that demonstrate behavior in isolation. However, if the demand is interesting and severe, I may be spurred into finishing a richer demonstration.

                              <span>Hi all. I have fido-mode enabled. How can I make fido-mode prioritize exact match? Say I have two functions foo and foo-bar and I have just called the function foo-bar (M-x foo-bar and press Enter). Now, I want to call foo. I type M-x foo and the suggestions foo-bar and foo show up in that order. So if I press enter (bound to icomplete-fido-ret), it runs foo-bar even though foo is an exact match. I know I can run foo by M-x foo M-j, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m asking. 
 I&#x27;ve read through the definitions of the various styles in completion-styles-alist, but I can&#x27;t find what I&#x27;m looking for. For reference, this is my current setting for completion styles: (setq completion-styles &#x27;(emacs21 basic partial-completion))
 Any help would be appreciated.

But logseq keeps a lot of incremental backups, so when I try to search my notes directory with SPC n * or SPC * (using doom) I get a huge number of useless results from the Notes/logseq directory (Notes is my org directory, Notes/pages is my roam directory). I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to exclude Notes/logseq from search results search-notes-for-symbol-at-point and am not having any luck. Anyone have ideas?

                              <span>So my problem with large line freezing emacs is solved to a reasonable and usable degree. My next problem is: when I print that long string (it&#x27;s a response from an api which contain a lot of data) it takes around 20 seconds to output all of the string while in the terminal, it works pretty fast (certainly less than a second, I&#x27;m using alacritty). Is there any way to print them faster?
 My long line optimzing settings are set globally and they don&#x27;t have any effect on emacs outputting the large text. It&#x27;s a python script and I tried to run it in shell, eshell, and python inferior shell in emacs but noticed no difference.
 Also another thing: is there a way to view for example, only the last 10 thousand characters of buffers that are not files? I see that vscode has implemented it and I think it would help with emacs using less ram. THANKS!

 I create a new note with org-roam-node-find RET  RET. My note names are stuff like daily.2022.05.10, with dots used as hierarchical separators. Org replaces all the dots in the name I supplied with underscores (e.g. daily_2022_05_10).
 I suppose I could just accept the difference, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like the Emacs way, not to mention underscores are easy for me to mistake as dashes, which have another function in my naming system. I&#x27;d like for it to just accept the exact name I give it without replacing anything.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a specific example for a concept I want to capture within my Zettelkasten, but I&#x27;m having a hard time identifying how to go about it.
SITUATION
I&#x27;m reading my book on product management when I encounter this infographic which essentially summarizes the entire book in one image.
I&#x27;m ECSTATIC!  This contains each of the individual pieces of the system (atomic ideas).  But then my enthusiasm dies down as I realize this image is essentially MULTIPLE ideas in one graphic, triggering analysis paralysis as I consider how to capture this within my Obsidian-based Zettelkasten.
MY QUESTION FOR YOU
Before you read on, pretend you ran into this information.  Your goal is to use your Zettelkasten to help you write strategy documents for your company AND to write articles for product managers in startups to help them launch better products.
How would YOU capture the gold within this infographic within your Zettelkasten?
OPTIONS I&#x27;M CONSIDERING
Now that you&#x27;ve considered your own solutions, here&#x27;s a few I thought of.
Create one Obsidian Canvas, capturing the entire infographic (a Card for each part of the flowchart and each checklist).  Then begin creating Zettels or linking existing Zettels for each individual component, replacing each Card with a Note instead as I go.


Technically, this option violates the &quot;Atomic Notes&quot; rule since my first Zettel would be this full infographic - I&#x27;d be essentially capturing a contextualized idea, then breaking it down, which may not yield surprise insights as going bottom-up should.

Create an Overview Zettel (simple text file) with each item written out, then use this Overview Zettel to create individual Zettels from there.


Same concept as #1, but in a text file rather than a Canvas.

Keep this infographic in my Lit Note (aka Reference) and create individual zettels as I go.
Does one of these align with what you would do?  If so, which one and why?  If not, how would your approach differ from any of mine?
Thanks in advance!</span>

                              <span>I am confused about the startup time of Emacs with different combinations of the settings of package-enable-at-startup and package-initialize. I am using Emacs 29 and I make heavy use of use-package and I also have (setq package-quickstart t). 
 From https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/rvqijq/usepackage_and_packagequickstart_for_faster/ (or https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11q7ybf/is_packageinitialize_needed_in_the_init_file_in or https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/x63etn/very_long_startup_time_with_no_obvious_cause/in7bld8/ or https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/76242/is-package-initialize-needed-in-the-init-file-in-emacs-28-x-and-higher) I understand that I would not need to call (package-initialize).
 However, the combination
  ;;; in early-init.el (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) ;;; in init.el (package-initialize) 
 starts much faster (0.8 seconds) than setting
 ;;; early-init.el (setq package-enable-at-startup t) ;;; not calling (package-initialize) in init.el 
 (This second setup takes about 1.3 seconds to start).
 Of course, I might have other problems in my init.el file but, shouldn&#x27;t I expect that I should see a faster startup with the second combination?

 We&#x27;ve completed work on the initial prototype of Attribution-Based Economics that was announced at EmacsConf in December. Please read the launch announcement to learn more about what this release entails.
 The pilot projects (including Symex.el) are accepting financial contributions and will distribute them to sources of value including contributors and antecedent projects in a process that we all have a say in.
 We couldn&#x27;t have gotten this far without the support and participation of this fantastic community, so thank you! I hope, with your help, that we&#x27;ll manage to prove that non-adversarial economics is not only possible but much better in just every way, not least of which is bringing us together in creating value rather than pushing us apart as our world does today.
 I can&#x27;t wait to see what we&#x27;ll accomplish together!

                              <span>How can I open a file using the keyboard without losing focus on the speedbar frame? I can currently do this with the mouse, but there is only a command for editing &#x60;speedbar-edit-line&#x60; that takes focus away from the speedbar when opening the file, which is not ideal for when i want to preview files.
 also, unrelated, but i think speedbar is pretty good/underrated built-in utility, the only downsides is what i just described and the fact that it can only exist as a frame (yes, i know sr-speedbar.el exists, but it&#x27;s pretty unstable in my experiance)

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I am almost ready to release version 3.0 of my org-gtd package, but I would like to get some feedback on the documentation before I do the actual release and mark it as stable (I have had some beta testers for the code already, but more wouldn&#x27;t hurt :D ).
 Ideally, the documentation is read on emacs, but the .org file is also available for consumption.
 The org-mode file is at https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/doc/org-gtd.org 
 All I need at first blush are your questions about things that don&#x27;t make sense, or that you think should be explained before approaching a given topic (or even knowledge organization). I have just noticed that github has added an outline option (the right-most icon at the top of the file info), which might allow you to skip quickly through the increasingly large &quot;upgrading&quot; section.
 Do note this assumes some amount of knowledge about Getting Things Done, so that might turn out to be a blocker anyway :) 
 The info file is here : https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/blob/org-gtd-3/org-gtd.info And obviously you might want to download it and load it inside emacs with C-u h i. For the info file, in addition to questions about things that make sense and don&#x27;t, I have questions about how things get displayed through the interface, what links make sense or are surprising, what is helpful, etc.
 If you choose to help, I&#x27;ll be extremely grateful! You can leave the feedback here in comments, or open it as an issue on Github, as you prefer.

                              <span>I have a couple of projects which they either have large outputs in a single line or a large code in a single line. It&#x27;s impossible to edit them in Emacs because of extremely low performance and constant freezing. Is there any way I can fix this?
 update: So long is not working. I also installed emacs29-git from AUR but still no luck. Really? Emacs, the great extensible editor can&#x27;t handle long lines? That&#x27;s like a big body builder not being able to hold its poop. It&#x27;s BASIC functionality...

                              <span>I learnt emacs from its tutorial. My initial goal was to use it as code editor for multiple languages: C, C++, Python, Java maybe javascript and rust ...
 I installed lsp and some other things from reading guides, its somehow works but i am still far away from using it at comfortable level.
 I dont know how to customize my emacs. I basically use C-f C-b C-e C-a and some other basic commands when i use emacs. I dont know how can i customize my .emacs file according to my needs. 
 For example, I want to have a left side panel for browsing dirs/files when coding, and having a run button since everytime when i want to test my code, I&#x27;m switching shell window of emacs and calling my executable. But I can&#x27;t.
 In conclusion, I want to configure emacs for my coding needs but i dont have sufficient knowledge and i cant understand much from what i read/watch on internet. I cant find good guides etc. 
 Can i get any advice, to make up for my deficiencies?

 I&#x27;m fairly competent with elisp but I&#x27;m a mu4e newbie and Fastmail&#x27;s IMAP behavior is puzzling.
 Using Fastmail&#x27;s web app, when I &quot;Archive&quot; a message in the Inbox, it appears to move that message to the IMAP folder &quot;Archive.&quot;
 But from mu4e, after syncing with mbsync and indexing with mu (i.e., mu4e-update-mail-and-index), the supposedly archived messages still appear in the /Inbox folder in ~/Mail except now they have the IMAP &quot;Trashed&quot; &quot;T&quot; flag.
 Can anybody point me to a reference that can help me solve this mismatch? 
 Have I made an obvious misconfiguration?

                              <span>Howdy all, 
 So for the first time in over 20 years, I&#x27;ve switched to linux fron Mac as my daily driver.
 And of course, immediately tried to set up exwm, as one does...
 exwm seems to work generally fine, except that when I log in with it, it is way scaled down and opens up a frame about an eight the size of my screen. Everything is scaled down, the fonts, the windows, etc. I can fullscreen the frame, but the fonts are still all tiny. 
 Odd thing is that any other program I open up inside an emacs frame is scaled just fine... so it&#x27;s only emacs text buffers that have this issue.
 Running  emacs 29 pre-release compiled with native comp and x minimal emacs config with a handful of packages, mappings, and a few fns.. nothing fancy latest pop_os dell xps 15 3840 x 2400 resolution no exwm specific config other than exwm-enable (did try the example config)  all the font scaling and randr stuff seems to be set fine.
 Not sure where else to look.. 
 Any pointers much appreciated!! Thanks!!

                              <span>Basically im looking a replacement for insomnia, for me it was a good tool for testing api&#x27;s, but right now im looking for alternatives, cause with my current potato computer, app like insomnia is very slow to run. also doing everything in emacs is just cooler.
 I would appreciate some some packages, workflows for this kinda of job.

                              <span>I have the following in my init.el:
 (setq org-refile-targets &#x60;((,(directory-files &quot;~/org/ref/&quot; t &quot;\\.org$&quot;) :maxlevel . 2) (&quot;~/org/gtd/todo.org&quot; :maxlevel . 1) (&quot;~/org/gtd/projects.org&quot; :maxlevel . 2))) (setq org-refile-use-outline-path &#x27;file) (setq org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil) (setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes &#x27;confirm) 
 And it seems to work except for one thing. I&#x27;m using helm, and when I hit my refile key sequence I get a *helm-mode-org-refile* window, and I only want it to show refile options/candidates that meet the given maxlevel limit. I assumed this would mean (e.g., with maxlevel 1) that this would only allow refiling into my todo.org file as top-level headlines. I don&#x27;t want to see existing headlines as autocomplete options for that file, if I type &quot;todo&quot; I only want to see &quot;todo.org&quot;. For projects.org (with maxlevel 2) I want to see the top-level headlines, and nothing lower. Is this possible? Is helm messing this up?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;d like to do some well-defined modifications on links that point to locations in org-files.
 My goal is to replace the search string in the link with the line number. For example, convert
 [[file:file-path::search-string][description]]
 to
 [[file:file-path::1][description]]
 I am looking for a function that returns the link&#x27;s target and description as well as the regions where they reside. I can write one, but I&#x27;d prefer something that already ships with org.
 Thank you,
 Mirko

 Is there a better way to search / fuzzy search all agenda files or all org / org roam files? 
 Currently using Doom.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a weird bug where, when calling org-time stamp, the date picker appears in the active buffer (instead of the minibuffer) and overwrites the content of whatever is in the active buffer. 
 I&#x27;ve got the same config running on my Linux machine - where the org timestamp behavior works as expected. Reinstalling emacs and Doom (brew install emacs-mac) has not solved the problem. 
 Google, Stack Exchange and Reddit search have yielded no luck. Anyone else seen this behavior / have any ideas?

                              <span>So many people crying about how Scala is supposedly dying and getting &quot;replaced&quot; by languages like Kotlin. Yes, Scala has some problems but seriously this is becoming ridiculous.
 Where would Kotlin be without Android? Probably dead. And what does it have over sbt? As if Gradle were any better. Each time I&#x27;m upgrading my JDK, Gradle starts crying about not supporting the latest JDK and wants me to download a whole new wrapper for it. Same goes for Rust. I don&#x27;t know why you would compare Rust to Scala. Besides, both Rust and Cargo have their own set of problems. 
 Seriously, I feel like there&#x27;s a bunch of people who intentionally bad-mouth Scala to make their &quot;own&quot; langauges look better.

                              <span>Hi everybody! My name is Abdullah Zeeshan and I am from Hyderabad, India.
I am relatively new to all this PKM stuff! In the time that I spent thinking about knowledge, ideas, learning, note-taking, etc. I concluded that the Zettelkasten framework has a lot of power and simplicity among other frameworks.
I am yet to understand many things so I might be asking a lot of beginner questions here and wish to contribute as I progress forward!
Happy to be here!</span>

 I&#x27;m currently working on generating assembly code using the CodeGen.X86 module, but I&#x27;m struggling to find any useful documentation beyond the dry one on Hackage. 
 Does anyone know of any other documentation or have any experience using this module in a project? I would really appreciate any help or advice that you can give me.
 Thanks so much in advance!

                              <span>This is not really a haskell question, but is very easily expressed in haskell constructs. Two common ways to sort lists are sortOn :: Ord b &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] and sortBy :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]. My question is this: Can sortBy be implemented via sortOn (a la the title, for all cmpFn)? Since I&#x27;m assuming the answer is &quot;no&quot;, is there a good way to tell, for a given cmpFn if sortBy cmpFn can be implemented as sortOn fn?

 Are there any good text-based diagramming tools that one can use to get inline diagrams? Maybe graphviz or tikz?

                              <span>Hi,
 I want to use flyspell with a hunspell backed. I prefer hunspell because it offers multilanguage dictionaries which can be very useful for me. My configuration is:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq +v/LANG &quot;en_GB&quot; +v/DICPATH &quot;/Users/me/Library/Spelling/&quot; +v/MULTIDIC &quot;en_GB,en_US,de_DE&quot;)
 (use-package flyspell :straight t :after ispell :init ;; Set the locale for the dictionary (if (string-equal system-type &quot;darwin&quot;) (setenv &quot;DICTIONARY&quot; &quot;en_GB&quot;))
 (setenv &quot;LANG&quot; +v/LANG)
 ;; Dictionary path (setenv &quot;DICPATH&quot; +v/DICPATH)
 :config ;; Use hunspell (setq ispell-program-name &quot;hunspell&quot;) (setq ispell-really-hunspell t)
 ;; ispell-set-spellchecker-params has to be called ;; before ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic will work (ispell-set-spellchecker-params)
 ;; Declare a multi-language dictionary and switch to it (ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic +v/MULTIDIC) (ispell-change-dictionary +v/MULTIDIC t)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, this does not work. My dictionary folder is populated like so: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ tree ~/Library/Spelling /Users/tc/Library/Spelling ├── dynamic-counts.dat ├── en_GB.aff ├── en_GB.dic ├── en_US.aff ├── en_US.dic ├── fr_FR.aff ├── fr_FR.dic ├── it_IT.aff └── it_IT.dic
 1 directory, 9 files &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 While hunspell is detected, it fails to detect any dictionary :( I test this like so: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ hunspell Hunspell 1.7.2 welcome
 welcome 0
 test
 test 0

                              <span>Hi. I don&#x27;t know if I am misunderstanding the documentation but I have not been able to get this right. If I have these two lines in one buffer:
 Test 0
 test 0
 Running M-x replace-string from test 0 to test 1 changes the lines above to:
 test 1
 test 1
 I want the first line to be kept capitalized, i.e. Test 1.
 Thanks.

 brew install --cask emacs 
 and then installed doom as instruction on doom github: 
 git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs ~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install 
 Any help is appreciated, thank you so much.

                              <span>When dealing with log files, I find the Auto-revert-mode is useful to monitor the changes. However, it can also consume more system resources, particularly on large files which updates frequently over tramp. I want a simple solution where a single key-press can update the log file on demand. Moreover, I don&#x27;t want to accidentally edit it so I want the read-only mode with single key-press update feature. I have the following pipeline:
  
Open the log file and convert to read-only-mode (C-x C-q key-press).
 When read-only-mode is activated then we remap the &#x27;g&#x27; key to the revert-buffer. One possible solution is to use &#x60;current-local-map&#x60; function but the downside is that remapping will be activated in all the files opened with that major-mode. This problem is discussed in https://www.reddit.…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 pretty much the title question. I asked the same on r/lisp but I realize it&#x27;s better suited here. I like Edebug because it allows to follow the computation even in a single form, from the inside out. Like, given something like
 (+ 3 (/ 4 n))
 I can see exactly not only what n is, but also what are the intermediate results. The closest thing I found for now is Sly&#x27;s stickers, but I wondered if there was an actual equivalent. Otherwise, I find CL&#x27;s debugger a bit difficult to use in step-mode, but that could easily being me not having read the manual thoroughly. So, does a CL-Edebug exist, much like CIDER&#x27;s for Clojure? And if not, can I use SLIME/Sly to step between forms (from inside out)?
 P.S., IIUC Sly is the improved (better?) version of SLIME. Is it right?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use org-capture and doct to insert entries in an org file. The content it needs to insert is not always the same, but the position in the file is. I&#x27;ve written my function to go to the correct position and tried with %c to capture and insert the latest value in the kill ring that I populated with the hook function that prompts me for a contact and formats it correctly.
  (let ((org-capture-templates (doct &#x60;(&quot;new item&quot; :keys &quot;i&quot; :type entry :template &quot;* %c&quot; :function my/goto-current-project-contacts :hook ,(kill-new (completing-read &quot;Select contact: &quot; (org-ql-select my/contacts-file &#x27;(level 1) :action #&#x27;my/contact-format))) :immediate-finish t)))) (org-capture nil &quot;i&quot;)) 
 However this gives me an error:
 doct--convert-declaration-maybe: DOCT Wrong type argument: (functionp doct--variable-p null), (:hook &quot;selected contact&quot;), (&quot;new item&quot; :keys &quot;i&quot; :type entry :template &quot;* %c&quot; :function my/current-project-contacts :hook &quot;selected contact&quot; :immediate-finish t)
 EDIT: I just discovered you can use progn in the template string. Should this not be added to the wiki or am I blind and looked over it for a couple of times? https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html
 So this works:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun testtest () (completing-read &quot;Select contact: &quot; (org-ql-select my/contacts-file &#x27;(level 1) :action #&#x27;my/contact-format)))
 (let ((org-capture-templates (doct (&quot;new item&quot; :keys &quot;i&quot; :type entry :template &quot;* %(progn (testtest))&quot; :function my/goto-current-project-contacts :immediate-finish t)))) (org-capture nil &quot;i&quot;)) &#x60;&#x60;
 Can I move the testtest function into the template so I don&#x27;t need to declare it separately? I can&#x27;t seem to figure out the quotes of the &quot;Select contact: &quot; string.

 Did anyone face the issue I described in the title? Here is an example:

 If I select the Heading 1 and run org-do-demote, I get
 ** Heading 1 Some text *** Heading 2 Some text 
 If you know how to solve this or an alternative command, please let me know!

                              <span>I struggled a few days, and finally success building feature/android branch of my fork of Emacs repo(forked from mirror of Emacs on savannah) with Github Actions.
 I was looking for as such, because I donnot have android development environment.
 If there is Emacs user on android like me, it will little help such problem.
 To use this, it requires only a few,
  
Mirror/Fork Emacs repositry from repositry on savannah or gitlab , or emacs-mirror repositry on github self(my case, https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/).
 
Create Github Actions&#x27; workflow(simply add [https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) to the repository, and enable workflow from Github web UI).
 
Change the permission of the workflow from &#x27;Read repository contents permission&#x27; to &#x27;Read and write permissions&#x27;(also from Github web UI).
 
 If you check ./configure step, you will notice this workflow could work very limited target(me), but adjust ./configure option if architecture it may work your architecture of android device.
 ※ I donnot have any android development experience since, I often run another workflow[https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/.github/workflows/build.yml](learn_android.yml) to adjust configure cited in [https://github.com/ayatakesi/copy-of-emacs-mirror/blob/feature/android/java/INSTALL](java/INSTALL).
 I hope this will help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce some changes to PureScript Domains that I think will make the service much more useful than it has been over the last year-plus.
 First, subdomains have been replaced by subpaths. For example, the documentation for my purescript-tecton library can be found at purescri.pt/tecton. Accordingly, PureScript Domains is now PureScript Domain (although previously-registered subdomains remain active).
 Second, a purescri.pt URL will automatically be activated for any package added to purescri.pt/registry. By default, it will redirect to the corresponding GitHub repository, but you can change this behavior or opt out through a simple pull request.
 If you would like to participate, please visit purescri.pt for details.
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.
I&#x27;ll start.
I finally released my project that extends The Archive, showing an &quot;Idea Explorer&quot; on demand for every note. This can be thought of as a way to look at &quot;note sequences.&quot; Sequences that develop an idea. I&#x27;m looking for collaborators to develop this idea further. Idea Explorer - an extension exclusively for The Archive.
This past week I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to practice and work on my technique for onboarding videos into my ZK. Speed and timing are critical—speed in taking notes and timing in reviewing the event. I feel I&#x27;ve gained a little success making a rough, rough draft during the presentation, then immediately after, as part of the process of watching a video, I expand my notes as I would if they were highlights from an article. Having a few minutes of uninterrupted time immediately after the video presentation to fill in my thoughts on my note is critical.
I&#x27;m looking to do more of this. I get excited when I onboard live streams or Zoom events more than videos where I can start, stop, and replay the action. They feel more dynamic, and they spark my juices.
Maybe I should try sketch-noting. It just feels like my skills at sketching are so poor that I&#x27;d miss stuff with the fast pace of a live presentation. Maybe this would be best reserved for youtube videos.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using org-roam for a while, and it&#x27;s going great; however, I sense some inconvenience with having a big amount of encrypted org files, especially when they don&#x27;t use the same key. This makes it much harder to search through the notes since I&#x27;ve to decrypt them each. So I was thinking if giving up the mix for having all the notes to be encrypted in one directory would fix that, like having all the notes encrypted by default but all of them also decrypt at once, so they become easier to search &amp; query. But I don&#x27;t know even how to do that, the best came to my mind is to encrypt the directory itself, but I also have no idea of how this can be done :P 
 Any suggestions? 
 p.s. I use disk encryption already if that matters, but I want extra protection.

                              <span>Hello,
 I would like to use Emacs for everything, and currently my E-Mail is the last thing that is missing.
 Currently, my Neomutt is set up with the following in mind:
  
POP3. I download it to maildirs with mpop for several accounts
 msmtp is configured for the same accounts
 Abook is used for address book
  
Which client, methods, etc. would you recommend so that I can continue using the already set up mpop with maildirs and msmtp, with multiple accounts?
 Abook is not necessary, as I bet there are ways to keep contact information in Emacs?
 Thanks in advance.

 was frustrated with installing emacs through apt (ubuntu 22.10) so i went into my /bin and deleted everything emacs related. i installed the flatpak, hated the UI and wanted to install emacs with apt again, only for it to say it was &quot;downloaded&quot;, but it never populated my /bin again.

 I have set a few variables so that the right el is loaded depending on the machine it is loaded on (linux vs windows). I have removed the eln cache, the whole straight directory, so that everything is downloaded againwhen installing on the Windows machine..
 And I get the following error message when starting emacs 28 on Windows.
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable dbus-registered-objects-table) dbus-unregister-service(:session &quot;org.freedesktop.Notifications&quot;) ednc--stop-server() ednc-mode(-1) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;c:/Users/frederic.mougel/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; &quot;c:/Users/frederic.mougel/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; t t) load(&quot;c:/Users/frederic.mougel/.emacs.d/init&quot; noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #) #f(compiled-function () #) t) command-line() normal-top-level()  I have searched for dbus or freedesktop in my emacs.d, did not find any mention of them.
 Do you have any idea where/why a linux module dbus inevitable is? I am lost here... Thanks for your help

 Part of the functionality I would like to have is executable source blocks in my org files, the issue is that sending code to a remote emacs instance and sending the results right back sounds like some kind of security nightmare. So I need to sandbox it.
 One option I&#x27;ve considered is using a docker container (or similar), I feel like there is a better approach though. Have any of you done anything like this?

                              <span>Hi y&#x27;all
 After starting with emacs-lisp, I fell into kind of a rabbit hole, and now I&#x27;d like to use emacs-lisp and or the common-lisp extension to rework some kinks in my personal configuration.
 I have found some good resources myself, but I simply trust this community more than search engines or ChatGPT.
 Often there isn&#x27;t any correct way to program something. But there always are exponential amount of horrible ways to program something. And many of those bad solutions get the job done in finite time and with finite resources.
 [disclaimer: while likely irrelevant in this case, I do use doom emacs] 
 After my last question I spend some time learning more about programming generally, as well as lisp syntax. So now I feel I have bit better understanding of emacs-lisp thanks to that. I act…</span>

 I have company installed with among others the company-elisp backend, but no elisp functions completion. This comes from doom emacs by the way.
 Thanks for the info.

                              <span>Dear r/emacs community,
 We are researchers at Inria (EP Loki) studying how users automate frequent actions in their daily use of interactive software (e.g., macros in Emacs, actions in Blender, or actions in the Adobe Suite). We recently created a questionnaire that takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete and are looking for participants (we tried to shorten it as much as we could). We unfortunately cannot offer compensation for that, but are hoping data from volunteers will help us design more customizable systems on the long term. Any help would be deeply appreciated.
 Questionnaire : https://expe.lille.inria.fr/limesurvey/index.php/526753?lang&#x3D;en&amp;community&#x3D;emacs
 If this research is of any interest to you, we are also looking for participants to interview about their specific solutions to automate frequent actions. Please contact use if you are willing to share your experience, our emails are available in the first page of the questionnaire or you can simply DM me.
 Note: be aware our questionnaire relies on LimeSurvey which uses non-libre JS libraries.

Additionally, I feel like it does not help the time it takes to generate the fragments to have it deal with all the page formatting. Is there a way to force org-latex-preview to use packages/newcommands relevant to generating math fragments?

                              <span>lam is a tool to quickly define, use and discard buffer local abbrevs: https://github.com/ChanderG/lam 
 Normally abbrevs are either global or major-mode specific. This adds a certain friction - you would need to think about the abbrev naming (can&#x27;t freely use short names) and the importance/frequency of the abbrev.
 Instead, lam allows you to quickly define context specific abbrevs on the fly. The best part is that since abbrevs can execute elisp, you can do a lot more than just simple text expansions. 
 Want to hear from you on how you use abbrevs and if this approach can open up new workflows for you.

                              <span>I am writing a HOF which basically takes a function as argument.
 But this argument function has to be generic and also has to be applied inside the HOF.
 Ex: def foo(fn: (A, B) &#x3D;&gt; C, a: A, b: B) &#x3D; { //some decision control statement fn(a, b) }
 def foo(fn: (D, E, F) &#x3D;&gt; H, d: D, e: E, f: F &#x3D; { fn(d, e, f) }
 how can I write one foo function which can take lots of variations of fn?

                              <span>Hi all, Linux focused content creator, I currently use Obsidian to store my video ideas and scripts/research. I am trying to focus on including both the visual and audio portion of the script now. Obsidian has multi-column mode, but I&#x27;m unable to edit the columns side by side. I find having the columns under each other in editing view to hinder me trying to think through the process.
 This got me thinking, I should open two files side by side, a _audio and _visual file. I could kind of do this in Obsidian, though with the current way kanban works, it would not be an ideal setup. I&#x27;d have to link the audio or visual (or both) file to the entry from kanban. This seems like it would get difficult to deal with after a while.
 This has led me to think about neovim with markdown fi…</span>

                              <span>I would LOVE to use the language. I learnt the basics, wrote some simple programs. But the whole tooling (stack, cabal, hls, ghcup etc.) just confuses and frustrates me because NOTHING works (atleast not without hours of trying). I just want my vscode setup so it shows me errors and warnings and maybe type signatures (hls), but i just always get errors when i want to import modules, for example:
  Multi Cradle: No prefixes matched pwd: c:\Users\nubch\Documents\haskell\tictactoe\tictactoe2 filepath: C:\Users\nubch\Documents\haskell\tictactoe\tictactoe2\app\Libr.hs prefixes: (&quot;app/Main.hs&quot;,Cabal {component &#x3D; Just &quot;tictactoe2:exe:tictactoe2&quot;}) 
 Can someone PLEASE give me an overview what everything is and how to set it up so that is just works. The last weeks I always want to program and learn the language but i just waste hours because something doesnt work. its terrible, i just want to code.
 ​
 I have stack and cabal installed and hls in vscode. I just want to make a simple program, where do I start? Should I use cabal or stack, or none?

                              <span>I would like to test a function that processes a partition of a list, for example
 concat&#x27; :: [[a]] -&gt; [a] concat&#x27; &#x3D; foldr (++) [] 
 For any partition of a list I would like to test the property concat&#x27; . anyPartition &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; id. So I thought about something like this (pseudo code):
 property $ \xs -&gt; concat&#x27; (anyPartition xs) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; xs 
 Of course anyPartition can&#x27;t be a pure function. As a first step I tried to create a function
 partitionOf :: [a] -&gt; Gen [[a]] partitionOf [] &#x3D; return [] partitionOf xs &#x3D; do i  partitionOf cs 
 but I don&#x27;t know how to write a property test with a function like that. Do I need an Arbitrary ([a] -&gt; Gen [[a]]) instance for it? How does this instance from Test.QuickCheck help?
  (CoArbitrary a, Arbitrary b) &#x3D;&gt; Arbitrary (a -&gt; b) 
 What&#x27;s the best way to accomplish this partition handling test? Most of these things like Gen, Arbitrary and CoArbitrary are pretty new to me.

                              <span>Who invented this? Why this triplet? What was the logic behind it?Map comes from functor, but what about the others and how to generalize the idea of the original people that set this up.Thank you very much for your time
 Edit: a person on 4chan directed me to the MapReduce programming model. Apparently, it was not the exact origin because they got the idea from Lisp:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce#cite_note-map-5
 Lisp developed map as part of their goal to create list programs (unbounded arguments functions). They implemented, as part of that, recursion and functionals (functions that take functions as arguments). map was part of that:
 http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/lisp.html 
 And reduce and filter are called catamorphism now. So that would be the track to figure out the origin and to generalize the concept.

This will be a video introducing an extension for The Archive. Designed for The Archive with plain text with wikilinks in mind. My ideas for this script are modeled after the public musings of Soren Bjornstad. The Idea Explorer is an idea that can help surface interesting relationships by looking at age, modification times, word count, and the prevalence of incoming and outgoing links. And more relevance can be &quot;fished out of the idea pond&quot; in the future.

This requires The Archive, Keyboard Maestro, and Python 3.9+.
Get Idea Explorer via GitHub

 It appears I have everything set up correctly, but authentication is not working, and it looks like it&#x27;s trying to make the calls with an invalid token.
 I have also tried making the calls using my token directly through curl, and I&#x27;m getting the same errors.
 Is anyone out there successfully connecting?
 Thanks!

                              <span>In R Markdown or Quarto, I can include inline code in a math equation, e.g.,
 The circumference of a unit circle is $$C&#x3D;2\pi{}&#x3D;&#x60;r 2*pi&#x60;.$$ 
 Is it possible to have inline code evaluated as well in a math environment in Org mode? I have tried this but it does not work.
 The circumference of a unit circle is \[C&#x3D;2\pi&#x3D;src_R{2 * pi}.\]

                              <span>I have monolithical scala 2 application with dependencies on slick and other stuff, where to other stuff includes the cats ecosystem. The slick dependency means I have no business case migrating it to scala 3 until slick does, which I&#x27;m not holding my breath for.
 I&#x27;m looking to split it apart, initially by pulling modules out and making them separate projects. These generally will not have the slick dependency keeping me on scala 2, but will often have cats dependencies.
 Is there a way I can start using scala 3 features in this project? I can publish for scala 3, and use the for213use3 functionality in my depending project, but then I will have binary incompatibilies between cats for scala 2 and cats for scala 3.
 Crossbuilding the dependency doesn&#x27;t get me anywhere, because then I still can&#x27;t use scala 3 features.
 What&#x27;s my road ahead here, if any?

 Enjoy!

 A desktop example is here:

 I will post a mobile example too since the idea is to have a single parser for both.
 if you also add ?dev to the url i.e http://127.0.0.1/index.html?dev then you can actually edit the script and use the browser as a development platform.

                              <span>I’m new to scala and a legacy code base, we have performance issues and after looking at metrics, most of the times threads are blocked because we are using await for long io tasks.
 I started refactoring the code to properly use futures and it became a complex change with little room for incremental testing. 
 Any suggestions for how to deal with this?

                              <span>Hi, When I try to kill a modified buffer (usually after forgetting what I have modified) I am asked what to do: yes (confirm the killl), no or &#x27;save and quit&#x27;.
 Does anyone know how to add a 4th choice which is &quot;show me the diff between my buffer and the saved file on the disk, possibly in another window?
 Thanks for your feedback.

 What&#x27;s the best way to only set them on Windows and also quiet the byte compiler? I can&#x27;t wrap the whole form in eval-when-compile. I could make the whole thing a macro that does nothing on non-Windows, but that seems overly complicated.
 Also a related question if I may: I&#x27;d like to replace the above setqs with defvar but in such a way that it always sets my value, not just if the var is undefined. Is there a standard way to do that?

 In image below this is my emacs frame, and it has tab lines from global-tab-line-mode repeated 3 times on each window (the lines with *scratch* init.el etc.), and i want to see only one tab line at top of the frame.

                              <span>Does anyone here use the native Emacs port for Android? It looks so great and has so much potential! 
 For the people using it: what keybindings did you set up? My smartphone has 3 programmable physical buttons: volume-up, volume-down, camera-shoot (actually there&#x27;s also a 4th key: camera-focus) and i was thinking to set them up as modifiers. Also, the toolbar could be placed on the bottom of the screen and include some commands like &quot;context-menu-open&quot; or &quot;M-x&quot;. 
 Share your config for Android, if you have one!

                              <span>My find-file always starts in $HOME.
 This is OK when starting Emacs for the first time.
 But using it after that I would like to start in the folder the currents buffers file belongs to or in the folder I latest opened a file from.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m wrong about the current buffers file folder. This works. But what if there is no file open. Then find-file should use the latest default-directory that was setup instead of the initial (after start) default-directory.

                              <span>I realized I could split my project into seperate files, use #+INCLUDE: folder/name-of-file.org and get it included, which is neat.
 However, how do I wildcard with #+INCLUDE? I would like to include all org files in a certain directory. Tried: #+INCLUDE: &quot;nameoffolder/*.org&quot;. Would be nice not needing to write out each file as I add them to that folder.

I erase the &quot;nil&quot; value that it is set to (I don&#x27;t know why) and restore the original value to get the dot, and save and then the dot appears when I reload dashboard. But I can&#x27;t save the customization permanently. It disappears and reverts to nil for the next session. In customize it tells me, &quot;CHANGED outside Customize. (mismatch)&quot; and the option to &quot;Apply and Save&quot; is greyed out. But I do not have that variable set anywhere in my init.el or my custom.el. So I am at a loss what is going. If anyone could explain why I am unable to set this variable, I&#x27;d appreciate it.

                              <span>While I absolutely adore the new pixel scroll precision mode, allowing me to finally have some good smooth scrolling on buffers, it seems to break scrolling in some places. Do note that when I talk about scrolling in this context, I mean with the mouse wheel (which I&#x27;ve configured to smoothly scroll, as you would on a web browser for instance).
 For example, doc-view mode. If you try to scroll with pixel scroll precision enabled, you&#x27;ll get sent to the top of the buffer, and going up or down just says &quot;beggining of buffer&quot; or &quot;end of buffer&quot;. Vertico is also broken, resulting in the same error. The corfu popup is broken as well.
 Anyone knows why it&#x27;s broken? Any fix or workaround? This is my config for this mode btw:
 (setq-default scroll-conservatively 10000) (setq-default scroll-margin 5) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 10.0) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-page t) (pixel-scroll-precision-mode t) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-down) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-up)

                              <span>What&#x27;s a good solution for making interactive web animations using Haskell? I want to be able to animate reduction graphs and include math symbols.
 The interactivity could be as simple as slowing/speeding the animation, and allowing for automatic &quot;stop points&quot;, like a slide show. Or it could go as far as to allow the content to be dynamically generated by user input. And perhaps people could click on graph nodes and see them expand.
 Reanimate sounds almost ideal, with its support for LaTeX. But unfortunately, it is all rendered in batch, not providing for any interactivity.
 FRP solutions sound very attractive. But reflex seems to be stuck on the outdated GHCJS, and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to build (using macOS on Apple Silicon). The newer JS output in GHC doesn&#x27;t yet have DOM support. And even if I used one of those, figuring out how to interact with a LaTeX renderer might be tricky.
 The diagrams library supports some animation, but it&#x27;s limited, and the never-seems-to-be-arriving version 2.0 is supposed to replace the animation support with something new.
 Another closely related option is Purescript, which seems to have a few FRP libraries, but I&#x27;m not sure how well any of them will work for this application.
 Another option would be to use or interface with a JavaScript library that does interactive animations, such as paper.js or Greensock.
 I figure that depending on the animation, pre-rendering some content may be desirable for performance, and that could be tricky.
 I&#x27;m leaning toward using Reanimate because, even though I have to give up on interactivity, it seems to have excellent support for LaTeX integration. So it&#x27;s probably easiest for prototyping, and I could switch to some other toolset later once I know what I want it to look like.

                              <span>Hello, Haskell has inspired me to take a look at type theory. I started reading the book Type Theory and Formal Proof. The book explains several type systems such as λ2, λω and λC but none of them happen to capture all of Haskell&#x27;s type system. They specifically miss the idea of type classes. That got me wondering what type system does Haskell use?
 Thanks!
 PS: I assumed here that Haskell is based on type theory. I have been told that several times.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 So I&#x27;m trying to model collectible coins using Haskell, and I&#x27;ve hit a bit of a roadblock with figuring out the best approach.
 Basically, each coin has a denomination, year, and mint. However, not all combinations of these three are valid. For example, a coin with denomination GR1 from the year 1923 could only have come from the Warsaw mint. On the other hand, the same denomination in a different year might belong to the Paris mint.
 My initial thought was to enforce these constraints using a smart constructor, but since this is a pet project aimed at learning, I would prefer to check it at compile time if possible.
 Here&#x27;s the model I&#x27;ve come up with so far:
 data Denomination &#x3D; ZL10 | ZL5 | ZL2 | ZL1 | GR50 | GR20 | GR10 | GR5 | GR2 | GR1 deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum) data Mint &#x3D; Warsaw | Paris | Birmingham deriving (Eq, Show, Bounded, Enum) type family OneOf xs where OneOf &#x27;[] &#x3D; Not IdPred OneOf (x : xs) &#x3D; Or (EqualTo x) (OneOf xs) type Years a &#x3D; Refined (OneOf a) Year newtype Year &#x3D; Year {getYear :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, TextShow, Show, Lift) type GR1EmissionYears &#x3D; Years &#x27;[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR2EmissionYears &#x3D; Years &#x27;[1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939] type GR5EmissionYears &#x3D; Years &#x27;[1923, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939] -- [...] 
 I could of course glue it all into a single union type, listing all the cases explicitly:
 data Coins &#x3D; Gr1Warsaw1937 | Gr1Paris1937 | Gr1Paris1939 - ... 
 But that will make it quite hard to e.g. filter and extract all coins of year 1937.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this problem. Do I need dependent types for this? Is there any simpler way?

                              <span>I recognize that asking such a question might seem peculiar; however, please allow me to elaborate. My journey with Linux has led me to an insatiable desire for optimization, beginning with vim/neovim and permeating nearly every aspect of my digital life. I have hand-crafted scripts for everything. The only thing left is to unify my coding and writing experience in one place.
 I use vim for coding, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. However, when it comes to writing, the visual representation of equations and figures help me concentrate on content. While vimtex (a vim plugin) offers a solution for creating LaTeX-based PDFs, the fusion of code and text hinders my thought process. For me, writing on a computer has to be similar to putting pen on a paper, where the focus is on content, not on the representation. For this reason, I sought an alternative solution and my search led me to TeXmacs. Here&#x27;s how my notes look. No ugly LaTex -- equations/figures look nice, etc.
 TeXmacs is nice and all, except that it&#x27;s not vim. I can&#x27;t use all of my fancy plugins (jump between files, write custom snippets, define custom actions, etc). It seems that emacs can be made just as powerful as vim, while also having the ability to display inline equations and images. This seems like the answer to all my questions, except that I only looking at the positives. I hesitate to succumb to the illusion of greener pastures, as vim has served me impeccably, save for the aforementioned limitations. Thus, I must ask: is Emacs the solution I seek?

                              <span>Hi,
 Sorry for cross-posting. I asked this on r/orgmode. However, I have not received any answer or suggestions there. I see that this reddit is far more active, and there are likely to be many expert users of orgmode here. So hopefully someone can suggest a solution. Thank you.
 New to org mode (used it briefly about 8-10 years ago). It is great. However, I would find it more helpful if I could do the following. Please see the example below with checkboxes.
 * Question - [X] Box 1 Some notes on Box 1 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. - [X] Another Box: box 2 Some notes on box 2 about what to do, and follow up notes when it is done. 
 When I check the boxes next to Box 1 and &quot;Another Box: box 2&quot; the lines &quot;Box 1&quot; and &quot;Another Box: box 2&quot; are grayed out (originally they are white when the boxes are not checked). This is great and I like that. However, the &quot;Some notes...when it is done&quot; are not grayed out even after the boxes are checked. They stay white. Is there an easy way to ensure that any notes below a checkbox are also grayed out when the checkbox is checked? Do I have to, or can I, mark it as notes or something else which would give this effect? Thank you.

                              <span>I am running a process that generates as significant amount of data (using start-process-shell-command).
 Everything works, but while profiling the code I have noticed that most time is spend capturing the output of the command. Looking at the processes output buffer, I think the reason is that this buffer (even though it is fundamental) is running several minor modes that are making things slower.
 How could I disable all minor modes in a buffer? I have tried this function, but it does not seem to work:
  (defun disable-all-minor-modes () &quot;Disable all minor modes in the current buffer.&quot; (interactive) (let ((mode-maps (buffer-local-value &#x27;minor-mode-map-alist (current-buffer)))) (dolist (mode mode-maps) (message &quot;mode [%s]&quot; (car mode)) (funcall (car mode) -1)) ) )) 
 thank you in advance
 p.s. I tried to write my own capture function, but it ended being wayyyy slower.

 Can anyone recommend what&#x27;s working for them without being too much in your face?

 I would like to show a buffer in side window but I don&#x27;t want to switch to this window.
 I remember there is an option like (allow-no-window) but this one wont enable to show the buffer ...
 When you use the C-x o then it will ignore/skip this window with this parameter 
 Please help me, I can&#x27;t find this parameter!
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m working in Emacs 28.2 (on openSUSE Tumbleweed). On this version only (not in previous versions), the header font for Org mode third level headers is extremely tiny, and only for those headers. That is, for characters preceded by &#x27;***&#x27;, the font is very compressed and completely unreadable, although still red in color, as they should be.
 ​
 It&#x27;s definitely an annoyance, any suggestions?

 A library to easily define git repo specific hydras. You can define a hydra for a git repo my-project like this:
 (repo-hydra-define &quot;my-project&quot; (&quot;i&quot; text-scale-increase &quot;In&quot;) (&quot;o&quot; text-scale-decrease &quot;Out&quot;)) 
 And call it from within the repo with M-x repo-hydra-show RET. So only one command for all repo specific hydras.

 - Which shortcut to use.
 - Number of loaded packages

                              <span>For systems where I can&#x27;t install external packages I use builtin snippet functionalities like tempo and expand and I can easily change between either of them. The expansions happen when I press space that makes it annoying when editing or just typing the the strings that trigger expansions. How do I make it so that this expansions happen on a specific key-combination and rather than space and how would I inhibit this expansion when space is pressed.
 I think both of them use abbrev based expansions but are not controlled by the functions and variables that control abbrev expansion.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 In my team we do use zio quite a bit in our codebase, usually with for-comprehensions. I just discovered the zio-direct project and it looks promising. The direct coding style can be a lot simpler to work with and more familiar to folks who are new to FP. I was wondering what has been people&#x27;s experience with moving to zio-direct. What worked well and what didn&#x27;t? Any gotchas one needs to be aware of? What are some reasons moving to zio-direct might be a bad idea?
 Thanks

                              <span>Without any will of revisiting awesome ZK Forum posts about categorization, I wonder if some of you have a clear definition of what a &quot;Thought&quot; might be within the ZK framework?
Out of the ZK filter, I like these two definitions:
a) Thought is a mental event or experience that is subjectively reported by an individual. 
From both, I find myself having these &quot;thoughts&quot; that go beyond the scope of a sparky &quot;fleeting note&quot;. 
Should we take them as a resource until we identify some &quot;zettels&quot; among them?</span>
