 Is there a way to get edirs to also ignore whitespace differences?

                              <span>My eww is slow with port 443 for all websites.
 I found a previous message here from 5 years ago stating this was a tls 1.3 issue.
  
I don&#x27;t know how to disable it and my searching hasn&#x27;t found any realistic ways
 
I don&#x27;t think it is smart to disable tls 1.3 as that sounds unsecure
 
 My eww settings are vanilla - nothing changed. I can get to https urls via firefox without any delay.
 Thoughts?
 I am using: GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.38, cairo version 1.16.0)

 any solution for this behavior?

 &quot;(set-face-italic &#x27;font-lock-comment-face nil)&quot; does not work.
 Neither does wrapping the specific text in code or verbatim.

                              <span>I am excited to finally announce the release of Forge version 0.4.0, consisting of 699 commits since the last release two years ago. It was actually released six days ago, at the same time as Magit and nine other packages, which all had to be released at the same time.
 To avoid getting myself into a similar situation again, I intend to release much more frequently going forward. So it is with delight, that I can report, that today I have already released version 0.4.1.
 More information can be found in the release announcement.

 So I find output of &#x60;xref&#x60; a bit unreadable, esp if a symbol is being referred in multiple files. So, I wanted to specify different color/font attributes for lines that contain name of the file where symbols are defined. 
 I noticed that - file name line although doesn&#x27;t have a different face, it does have a text-property called &#x60;xref-group&#x60;. Is there a way to colorize and specify some font attributes(such as bold) based on text-property.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to learn elisp (bit by bit), and solving some problems on online website. I&#x27;m encountered following syntax couple of times.
 lisp (equal :sublist (list-classify &#x27;() &#x27;(1 2 3))) (equal :equal (list-classify &#x27;() &#x27;())) (equal :superlist (list-classify &#x27;(1 2 3) &#x27;())) 
 The task is to implement function list-classify that checks whether 2 list are equal or unequal or superlist or sublist (of one other). 
 I&#x27;m not asking how to implement it (please don&#x27;t tell me the solution). Just asking what does : represents. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called, (and more importantly what to search about on internet) where to read only about this part. 
 Currently I&#x27;m just lost directionless in the sea of elisp-manual. Don&#x27;t even know what to search in it.

 Am i misssing something or should there be a type error here?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Scala for many years. When I first started, Scala IDE (on Eclipse) was the only real IDE available, and it was terrible. Things have gotten a lot better since then with IntelliJ. However, in the past year or two, IntelliJ has become extremely unreliable for Scala. What do you all use for Scala editing these days?

                              <span>Is it possible to translate this contrived Haskell code to Scala 3?
 class Capture a where name :: Text instance Capture Int where name &#x3D; &quot;int&quot; instance Capture Bool where name &#x3D; &quot;bool&quot; data Captured &#x3D; forall a. Capture a &#x3D;&gt; Captured nameOf :: Captured -&gt; Text nameOf &#x3D; \case Captured @a -&gt; name @a 
 I assume &quot;Captured&quot; has to be a case class, but I struggle with the forall part. I&#x27;ve tried various permutations that contain &quot;using&quot; and/or &quot;[A]&quot;, but so far they&#x27;ve all resulted in &quot;polymorphic function types must have a value parameter&quot; errors.

                              <span>I have a org-mode file that is tangled to create various userconfigs. Given that the emacs-android package is pretty stable (and works great with e.g. texlive from termux), i want to tangle sourceblocks from the file. I am thinking of maybe adding tags like &quot;android&quot;, &quot;notebook&quot;, &quot;server&quot; and the like. I then want to call e.g. org-tangle-mobile to create files from all blocks with this respective tag. My brain is telling me i saw something like this before but i cant find the reference again or figure out how to so just by reading the Manual. Any experience?

It has been two years since I started Zettelkasten. Thanks @Sascha and @ctietze 
But I ran into one problem.
GIGO; I think that if you do Zettelkasten with bias, your wrong beliefs will become stronger.
How can I solve this?

 Why is this the case?

                              <span>I tried the built-in one. Wasn&#x27;t very impressed. It doesn&#x27;t show all files in the same tab bar by default? (I can get having tab groups, but I don&#x27;t really want it to assume that.)
 And the tab bar is... bad. Small, hard-to use, and very ugly.
 Is there something better I should try?

                              <span>Hey guys, I have been wanting some emacs-like mindmap app for a very long time, and all the while I&#x27;m thinking of implementing a lisp myself in a similar way. 
 It just downed on me that as complete emacs is already as a lisp machine it probably just lacks builtin API for a canvas, so I can probably fork the C part, keep only the language core and runtime(and keybinding system, I don&#x27;t know where it is yet), ditch the text-editor part, add canvas support with qt or something, then build a mindmap API in elisp.
 How doable do you think this is? Will emacs source be too tangled with the text-editor part for such thing, or is there some obviously better way to build a lisp mindmap app?
 ps: for reference, the mindmap app I&#x27;m thinking about is one with emacs-like lisp runtime and keybinidng system. That along I think will be enough for most things to be built on top off.

                              <span>I have ~/.config/emacs, with the usual init.el and early-init.el. I just learned about the no-littering package which looks great. I use elpaca for my package loader/manager. I&#x27;ve run through the migration process, all works OK when I do (use-package no-littering :ensure t) near the top of my init.el. But to really clean up, I want it to handle my eln cache, which I think means I need to load it in my early-init.el so I can call startup-redirect-eln-cache on it. But of course elpaca isn&#x27;t set up there. If you have a similar config to mine, how do you handle this case?
 Same question for &#x60;elpa&#x60; and &#x60;elpaca&#x60;: I&#x27;d like those to go into &#x60;var/&#x60; but there&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem. What do you do?

                              <span>In a new job I have vowed to take better notes and I like the general Denote philosophy. So it&#x27;s installed, I&#x27;ve created a note, and so forth. 
 Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to set these things up? If I put a TODO in a note, it would be nice to be able to see an agenda view of uncompleted notes and links to where it was generated. I&#x27;ve read through the Agenda section in the Org manual but I&#x27;ll be honest, it was kind of long on detail and short on practicalities. I think I managed to get it work if I had a single agenda file in the ~/.emacs.d directory but what I&#x27;d like is something more comprehensive.
 I know it&#x27;s sort of a personal thing how people set it up, but I&#x27;m kind of starting from scratch on this and some models would be good. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I feel quite frustrated with the instability of counsel-projectile. I trigger &#x60;counsel-projectile-find-file&#x60; and it randomly opens switch-project instead. The repository looks like not maintained anymore.
 I&#x27;m looking for a package that;
  
Allows me to switch projects easily
 
find files within project
 
Switching to other buffers in project
 
Search for code within the project.
  
And I&#x27;m looking for a fast UX. Any suggestions? 
 Here&#x27;s my current keybindings:
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p f&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-find-file)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p p&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-switch-project)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p b&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-switch-to-buffer)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p s&quot;) &#x27;counsel-projectile-rg)
 (define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-p r&quot;) &#x27;projectile-replace-regexp)

                              <span>A few days ago I found out about Open RSS. So far I only use it to get beautifully crafted feeds of YouTube channels and playlists with video descriptions and thumbnails. 
 I could have just used the feeds provided by YouTube instead, only if entries would have thumbnails and video descriptions.
 I could have just used an “intelligent” reader like Feedly. But I don’t like proprietary garbage with integrated AI that just ends up making my life harder. And also it’s not Emacs. 
 I could have just an alternative frontend like Invidious. But playlist feeds don’t have thumbnails and videos, entries obviously link to invidious instances and not to YouTube directly and these public instances are slow. I didn’t have the resources to selfhost my own instance and just wanted a convenient, performant solution. 
 I could have just used Elfeed in conjunction with Elfeed-tube. These packages are actually great, but I’m a Gnus user. 
 For anyone with similar opinions and experiences Open RSS might be very well worth a try. For me it hits a perfect sweet spot. It’s also privacy-friendly and is developed in a transparent fashion. Although the source code is not publicly available, at least as far as I know. But that’s understandable as they’re kept alive by their user’s donations.
 Mark, the developer of Open RSS, is quick to reply if one encounters any issues and already helped me out once.

                              <span>Hi every, I am reading the book &quot;Thinking with types&quot; and I get confused about implicitly universally quantified. Sorry if this question is silly because English is not my first language.
 In the book, the author says that
 broken :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b broken f a &#x3D; apply where apply :: b apply &#x3D; f a 
  
This code fails to compile because type variables have no notion of scope. The Haskell Report provides us with no means of referencing type variables outside of the contexts in which they’re declared.
  
Question: Do type variables have no scope or they are scoped within &quot;the contexts in which they’re declared&quot; (type signatures if I am not mistaken).
 My understanding is that type variables in type signature are automatically universally quantified, so
 broken :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b 
 is equivalent to
 broken :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b 
 forall a b. introduces a type scope. However, without the ScopedTypeVariables extension, the scope of a and b is the type signature where they are declared, but not the whole definition of broken.
 This quantification is to ensure that a and b in the type signature are consistent, that is, both occurrences of a refer to the same a, and both occurrences of b refer to the same b.
 Question: Is my understanding correct?
 Thanks.

 Safe resource management is impossible, every transitive mechanism is exposed, tracing dependency graph is impossible, async initialization of certain components is convoluted as fuck.
 So let&#x27;s move it.
 Where do I start? How do I trace components without dependencies? How can I make PRs that are as little disruptive as possible?

                              <span>I see a lot of different systems for numbering cards.
It seems to me that using a three- letter alphabetical code at the beginning would help organize better.
For instance LOG is Logic PHI is Philosophy.
Instead of having arbitrary numbers that have to be remembered, a three-letter code could kind of be like an airport code where it makes it really easy to remember, and of course they would be filed alphabetically and then numerically.
Why not?</span>

                              <span>As of what I&#x27;ve encountered so far, lists can be like:
 1) One
 2) Two
 3) Three
 So there cannot be any space in between because if so inserting a new element will restart the count
 1) One
 2) Two
 1) One
 Is there a way to avoid so?

                              <span>Coming up with minimalist Dependency Injection seems to be a favorite past time on this subreddit.
  
First it was /u/danielciocirlan with /u/odersky and this video https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1eksdo2/automatic_dependency_injection_in_pure_scala/
 Then /u/jivesishungry (and then /u/dgolubets ) with this post https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1eo3lc3/automatic_dependency_injection_using_implicits/
  
I think we can do it even simpler. Relying just on Scala&#x27;s implicit mechanism:
  
for components that are to be wired together, use case classes, so that Scala generates apply method to construct it
 use a helper method, which will call this apply, but fetch the arguments from the implicit context; we can call this method fromContext, more on it later
 have all the components …</span>

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;d like to experiment with Scala.js but I found it quite cumbersome to install a specific npm package: tonejs. My &#x60;Main.scala&#x60; file looks as follows:
 @JSExportTopLevel(&quot;Main&quot;) object Main { def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; { println(&quot;Hello, Scala.js!&quot;) val Tone &#x3D; global.require(&quot;tone&quot;).asInstanceOf[js.Dynamic] val synth &#x3D; Tone.Synth().toDestination() synth.triggerAttackRelease(&quot;C4&quot;, &quot;8n&quot;) } } 
 And my build.sc:
 import mill._ import mill.api.Result import mill.scalajslib._ import mill.scalajslib.api._ import mill.scalalib._ import mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule import mill.scalanativelib._ import mill.scalanativelib.api._ object tone extends ScalaJSModule { val platform &#x3D; &quot;js&quot; def moduleKind &#x3D; T { ModuleKind.ESModule } def scalaVersion &#x3D; &quot;3.3.1&quot; def scalaJSVersion &#x3D; &quot;1.16.0&quot; def ivyDeps &#x3D; Agg( ivy&quot;org.scala-js::scalajs-dom::2.8.0&quot; ) def npmDeps &#x3D; T{ Seq( &quot;tone&quot; -&gt; &quot;latest&quot; ) } } 
 However, when runnin &#x60;node out/tone/fastOpt.dest/out.js&#x60;, the compiler complains with:
 export { $e_Main as Main }; ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token &#x27;export&#x27; 
 Am I missing any extra configuration? I kindly appreciate any suggestion.

 the issue was rustic getting uninstalled but its unneeded dependencies not having been cleaned, so rust-mode was viewed as an orphaned dependency and not listed 
 im currently trying to install Rust-Mode but it i keep getting the message that it cant be found and looking at the package list there is no rust mode to be found https://imgur.com/a/tnbLKCl, i tried package refresh but it hasnt fxed the issue either

                              <span>Looking into the git repo of eglot the project seems a bit inactive. Last commit is 8 months ago.
 There are some old PRs just fixing typos in the README.md that never got merged. I am concerned.
 The README itself doesn&#x27;t give any news about the status or plans. Does anyone knows more?

 (defcustom my-test-customization &#x27;(one) &quot;Let&#x27;s test customization!&quot; :type &#x27;(set (const one) (const two) (const three) (const four))) 
 If you evaluate this and try to change it through customize-option, there are a few bits of surprising behavior:
  
When you first open the customize interface, one is checked by default, but the &quot;state&quot; widget says that the variable is edited, and the shown value isn&#x27;t in effect. If you C-c C-c nothing seems to change--one is still checked--but a describe-variable on my-test-customization says the value is now nil! Wit…</span>

 But when I&#x27;m on *eat* or *vterm* buffer, it prompts me for a Git repository to open, like it doesn&#x27;t know the current directory is already a Git repository.
 How to make the behavior of M-x magit-status on *eat* and *vterm* buffers the same as the one on *ansi-term* buffer?

 I am currently editing legacy code base that suffers from non-consistent code formatting rules. 
 Instead of having Emacs automatically format all source code automatically, which I normally do, I&#x27;d like to know if you guys found a way to format only the lines you have changed in your daily work? Maybe even in a automatic on-save -way?

                              <span>hallo. not finding a clear strategy for this from searching, so figured i&#x27;d ask here.
 i wanna open two side by side windows and start two different modes on them on startup. i&#x27;m familiar with hooks and opening two windows next to each other, but not sure how to write a function that I can run via cli -f flag that&#x27;ll open a specific mode in each window. any chance somebody can give me an example function def that I can build on?

I have used it and everything seems fine but please let me know if you see inconsistent things or colors that hurt your eyes. The theme is meant to be used as a dark style. To avoid posting a file and making you download it I&#x27;m instead pasting here the code:

                              <span>Hey Haskell enthusiasts!
 I just published a new blog post that dives deep into the Maybe Monad, exploring not just its theoretical underpinnings, but also its real-world applications. If you’ve ever wondered how this seemingly abstract concept can solve real-world problems, from handling uncertainty in finance to ensuring data integrity in cybersecurity, this post is for you!
 Check it out here: Unlocking Real-World Power of Monads: A Deep Dive into the Maybe Monad
 I’d love to hear your thoughts and any insights you have on applying monads to practical problems. Let’s discuss!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have dabbled with org-mode a bit in the past and then kind of stopped using it. In the meantime I switched to Colemak-DHm and an ortho split Miryoku keyboard so I feel like I will be starting from scratch again essentially.
 I am interested in using both org-roam and org-mode and I would like some guidance on how to get started. Besides the general advice, I have some specific questions.
  
Is there a recommended order in which to learn them?
 
Is org-roam just some extra commands on top of org-mode?
 
Do I need to adapt something (i.e. change location of keys) because of Colemak?
 
My use cases include notes for work and learning and I would also like to start keeping a personal diary. Shall these go to separate knowledge bases or in the same?
  
Thanks for all the answers in advance and have a nice day/night (wherever you are in the world :p)

                              <span>Minimal Emacs
 An Emacs modular template for early-init.el &amp; init.el as a kick starter to a custom Vanilla Emacs configuration that is optimized for performance and sensible settings.
 Author: James Cherti
 Github: https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d
 This is a base starter kit for vanilla Emacs. It&#x27;s really just an optimized early-init.el and an init.el that strives for fast startup times and sensible default settings. All the magic that is necessary is included. This is really nice because there&#x27;s a lot of conflicting information online about the best way to optimize GC, etc. in early-init.el and this project does it for you. I&#x27;ve seen similar settings but I also saw some new stuff I didn&#x27;t know about. 
 It is designed to keep those two files in git so you can update Minimal-Emacs. Setup additional modules for user customization in pre-early-init.el, post-early-init.el and pre/post for init.el as well. 
 It&#x27;s up to the user to add to the base. If you start with this kit then proceed to watch System Crafters Emacs from Scratch series, it will get you up and running very quickly. 
 James put a lot of effort into this base starter kit and I am digging it, no cap FR as the whippersnappers are accustomed to proclaiming. ;-)

                              <span>I recently switched to swaywm from gnome. I configured the org-download as follows
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (use-package org-download :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;org-download-enable) (setq-default org-download-heading-lvl nil) (setq-default org-download-image-dir &quot;~/ko-pa-ni/images&quot;) (setq org-download-screenshot-method &quot;~/.scripts/sway-contrib/grimshot savecopy area&quot;) :bind ((&quot;C-c d s&quot; . org-download-screenshot) (&quot;C-c d y&quot; . org-download-yank))) #+end_src 
 Whenever I use org-download-screenshot, the grimshot kicks in and I can draw a rectangle to capture the area I want on the screen, but then emacs freezes and there is no image found under the org-download-image-dir. I think it has to do with grimshot and org-download not communicating. Having no image in the directory tells me that org-download takes care of pushing the image to the configured directory but grimshot usually saves to ~/Pictures/screenshots but even there I cannot find the screenshots.

                              <span>I do get this error (Emacs 29 from Debian 12 backports) after updating all my packages after a long while:
 File mode specification error: (void-variable ) 
 I am not sure but I think I identified the error causing lines (see :hook) in the init.el.
  (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (if (not (string-equal (system-name) &quot;quark&quot;)) (eglot-ensure))) ) (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) (python-mode . hs-minor-mode) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) 
 The intention of that hook is to start &quot;eglot&quot; only if the current systems name is not &quot;quark&quot;. I do share this init.el between several machines and &quot;quark&quot; is a RaspberryPi4 not able to run eglot and its backend in a performant way. This worked well a long time until I upgrade my emacs packages…</span>

                              <span>I have used obsidian for long time for taking math notes with inline latex parts, which depends on plugins latex environment, latex suite, quick latex for obsidian. I&#x27;m trying to migrate from obsidian to org-roam, because of keybindings. But I have one problem: latex parts renders in org-file very bad (image). How to solve this problem and how you think: take math notes in separate pdf-files which linked with org-roam or to take all notes in org-files?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been following along Real World Haskell, and getting the indentation right while following their style is infuriating.
 E.g,
 -- file: ch03/Lending.hs lend amount balance &#x3D; let reserve &#x3D; 100 newBalance &#x3D; balance - amount in if balance &lt; reserve then Nothing else Just newBalance 
 I find myself Pressing &quot;tab&quot; to overshoot the appropriate column, then hitting &quot;backspace&quot; in my editor to delete 4 spaces at a time (too many), then repeatedly smacking &quot;space&quot;, overshooting again, deleting 4 spaces again, etc....
 Since the appropriate number of spaces to indent changes expression to expression, are there any editor/plugins/etc. that would allow for &quot;contextual&quot; tab stops, so that &quot;tab&quot; and &quot;backspace&quot; simply add and remove the right amount of spaces relevant to the expression I&#x27;m currently editing? I&#x27;m currently using vscode with haskell-language-server.
 Or would it be better to simply adopt a style that ignores this problem entirely? I.e., Google leads me to https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide
  
The indentation of a line should not depend on the length of any identifier in preceding lines.

I&#x27;m new to haskell, and I&#x27;ve already set up vs codium with the official package, which installs a lot of stuff for you. I would love recommendations for vs codium extensions too, as I haven&#x27;t programmed since college (CS) and I&#x27;m very rusty. I&#x27;m learning it strictly for fun, btw, to solve challenges, for example.

                              <span>Hi, I was reading &quot;A System for Writing&quot; by Bob Doto and in the book, he specifically introduce the Folgezettel system.
I totally understand it was probably another name for sequence notes in Zettel, my question is, if I were to do this, and how do I know if the number I give to a note is occupied? He wrote in the book that &quot;There are no “occupied slots,” because there is no prescribed order.&quot; but if that&#x27;s the case, does it mean I can have two note share the same number , say &quot;1.1 apple is edible&quot; and &quot;1.1 Elephant is large mammal&quot;? My current thought on a work around is to put that number after a UID, say yyyyMMddHHmmss and a &quot;-&quot; and after that begin the number sequence.
Not sure If I explain my question properly, wish you all good luck.</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.10 and yampa-test 0.14.10.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa&#x27;s features.
 This new release introduces a new type of integral that implements the trapezoid integration rule. Simulations executed at low sampling rates can behave in ways that violate expected physical laws (e.g., systems may gain energy over time due to inaccuracies in the calculation of positions and velocities). This new integral behaves in a more stable way in such cases. Thanks to Github users idontgetoutmuch , miguel-negrao and thalerjonatha…</span>

                              <span>This subreddit seems to be one of the places where people might be able to help, so I hope this is appropriate here.
 I&#x27;m trying to use Magit a bit more instead of command line git invocations. But I seem to be unable to successfully commit changes from Magit, and I can&#x27;t figure out where the problem is. I&#x27;m hoping someone here will be able to point me in the right direction, maybe giving some more suggestions for debugging the issue.
 The Symptoms
  
I open a file in Emacs from a directory with a Git repository
 I press C-x g to open Magit
 I move the point to an unstaged file and press s to stage its changes
 I press c c to try to commit the changes
 The line at the top of the Magit buffer changes to &quot;GitError! Git failed [Type &#x60;$&#x27; for details]&quot;
 I press $
 
A new buffer opens containing…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a CS graduate eager to create something meaningful for the developer community. I&#x27;m planning to build a non-trivial Emacs package (or a similar project) that could take months to develop and would be truly helpful to others.
 Do you have any ideas or unmet needs that you&#x27;d like to see addressed?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having this issue for a while and couldn&#x27;t find anything on it online, including the vterm GitHub repos. I figure if it&#x27;s a known issue someone here will have also experienced it.
 This seems to persist between Emacs versions, and it only happens when I open a vterm shell while using TRAMP in a remote server. If I instead open a vterm shell on my local computer first and then ssh into the remote server, it doesn&#x27;t have this issue.

 /workspace/x/a/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c /workspace/x/b/another/very/long/path/.../foo_b.c /workspace/x/ya/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c ... 
 Right now I&#x27;m using my own adhoc/hackish command (plugged into capf@vertico) to complete with &quot;foo&quot;.
 Vertico would show: (/workspace/x is the git repo&#x27;s top-level)
 Open File: foo foo_a.c in a/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_a.c in ya/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x foo_b.c in b/another/very/long/path/.../foo_a.c at /workspace/x 
 Is there any melpa/elpa/buitin package/solution that does file-name completion while ignoring the dir? especially ones that let vertico clearly show the filename sans-directory in the completion list.

Nothing seems to be working. Eg, &quot;Go to definition&quot; etc.

                              <span>I have an org directory that I use primarily at work where I use Emacs 29.4 on WSL2 on Windows 11. I have a few additional computers at home, including a web server. I don&#x27;t really use org on mobile devices. I want to be able to put my org files on my own server and read them primarily from off-network.
 Currently I&#x27;m syncing my org files through OneDrive, which works for the most part. I only rarely use my personal computers for org, but would like to be able to reference them, esp. from the server for automations.
 It occurred to me that this could be done reasonably easily through WebDAV. I&#x27;m literate enough to set up the technical stuff myself, but realize I may be overlooking other options. Really, I&#x27;m less literate in Emacs/org, so I&#x27;d ask the community - is there anything wrong with using a WebDAV mount for org files? In terms of use, security, whatever. Is there some better way to share org files on my home server that can be mounted to a directory in linux?
 (for what it&#x27;s worth: I cannot use a VPN at work but can use an SSH tunnel)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m using vertico and marginalia in my emacs setup. I was following System Crafters video to set up and configure org-roam. I&#x27;m not seeing tags in my results when I search for nodes. For example, I have #+filetags: project in some of my nodes. But I don&#x27;t see them in the results when I run org-roam-node-find. I&#x27;m unable to filter by them.
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is related to marginalia or vertico. But here are my configs for both.
 Marginalia config
  (use-package marginalia :after vertico :custom (marginalia-annotators &#x27;(marginalia-annotators-heavy marginalia-annotators-light nil)) (marginalia-align &#x27;right) (marginalia-align-offset -5) :init (marginalia-mode)) 
 Vertico config
  (use-package vertico :bind (:map minibuffer-local-map (&quot;&quot; . rr/minibuffer-backward-kill)) :custom (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode +1) (setq completion-styles &#x27;(flex partial-completion) completion-ignore-case t completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides nil)) 
 Also, here&#x27;s one of my roam nodes:
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: AFD9D19B-00AC-477C-95CE-7F02BA88D527 :END: #+title: Foo #+category: Foo #+filetags: project * Tasks * TODO Test task SCHEDULED:  
 Am I missing any config? Any help would be appreciated.
 EDIT: I had to set the following line while setting up org-roam.
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat &quot;${title:*} &quot; (propertize &quot;${tags:10}&quot; &#x27;face &#x27;org-tag)))

 for example, the above thing is supposed to be an equation environment with \int xdx inside, but it is instead displayed with the ∫ character. How do I make org roam ui render the latex code?

                              <span>I am using org 9.8-pre. The preview system is great, except for the fact that I am left with a ton of org-tex-** files scattered around whatever directory I am editing files in. Can this be fixed by me, or is this currently a bug? Thanks.

                              <span>I just discovered a &quot;bug&quot; (it wasn&#x27;t a bug in magit, but a change in Git itself) in magit when I switched to a newer version of Git. After googling I found out that the problem has already been solved in magit over a year ago. Because I&#x27;m updating the Emacs packages once in a month, I was wondering why it is still in my local magit installation.
 The reason is that the release versions on NonGNU Elpa and Melpa Stable are still version 3.3.0, which was released on Oct 4, 2021. Does somebody know the reason why there are no new releases on those archives?
 Yes, I know I could use Melpa Unstable, but I don&#x27;t want it, because I&#x27;m serving a lot of my colleagues with an Emacs configuration and I don&#x27;t want to use unstable package versions.
 Yes, I know I could ask directly on GitHub, but I don&#x27;t want to create an account for just one question.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am developing the major and minor modes for Gobra, a Go verifier. When annotating a go program with specification, we use //@ or // @, and Gobra parses these lines as logic instead of just comments (we also have the multiline variant but let&#x27;s keep this as simple as possible).
 I have a minor mode for Go buffers to be able to interact with Gobra and I also want to add syntax highlighting for Gobra&#x27;s specification language. This means I have to override the default syntactic-face-function to work differently for these special comments.
 What I have is this until now:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defconst gobra-comment-regexp-prefixes &#x27;(&quot;// ?@&quot; &quot;/* ?@&quot;))

                              <span>We have a small team of &quot;algorithms engineers&quot; who, as most of the &quot;data science&quot; / &quot;ML&quot; sector, use python. Pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.: all have been very helpful for their explorations. We have been going through an exercise of improving the quality of their code because these algorithms will be used in production systems once they are integrated into our core services: correctness and maintainability are important.
 Ideally, these codebases would be written in Haskell for those reasons (not the topic I&#x27;m here to debate), but I don&#x27;t want to hamstring their ability to explore or build (we have done a lot of research to get to the point where we have things we want to get into production).
 Does anyone have professional experience doing ML / data-science / algorithms engineering in the Haskell ecosystem, and could you tell me what that experience was like? Especially wrt Haskell alternatives to pandas / numpy / various ML libraries / matplotlib.

                              <span>This is a bit of a follow-up from this post. I have two related problems, I&#x27;m at my wits-end and I was hoping for some advice.
 The problem basically boils down to injecting context into an Aeson FromJSON parser. If I wish to read a file of JSON objects that refer to each other, I would like to be able to replace an identifier reference with the actual object when it is read. For example
  data Region &#x3D; Region { regionID :: Text , regionName :: Text , regionType :: RegionType , regionParent :: Maybe Region , regionLocale :: Maybe Locale } 
 with data like
  [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ES&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Country&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;: &quot;es&quot; }, { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ES-CL&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Castille and León&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Subnational&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;ES&quot; } { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;ES-GA&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Galicia&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Subnational&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;ES&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;: &quot;ga&quot; } ] 
 I have an elaborate system of placeholders and normalisation at the moment to sort out the parent references to &quot;ES&quot; and I was wondering if there was something, a la Jackson, that would handle references naturally.
 I have lots and lots of other examples of this sort of need to reference other items.
 The other aspect of this in injecting this information, hopefully using the ReaderT pattern, into another parser that will use this data. As an example,
  data Location &#x3D; Location { locationID :: Text , locationName :: Text, , locationRegion :: Region } 
 and 
  [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Santiago de Compostella&quot;, &quot;region&quot;: &quot;ES-GA&quot; } ] 
 where the Galicia data, with all its useful information such as locales and holidays, replaces the &quot;ES-GA&quot; reference.
 I have wasted waaay to much time trying to figure out how to achive this and would appreciate any useful* advice.
 * With the caveat that I do not regard &quot;embed it into code&quot; as &quot;useful&quot;. The idea that I can&#x27;t give users control over their configuration makes my skin crawl.

                              <span>Daniel Ciocîrlan recently posted a video showcasing a dependency-injection (DI) approach developed by Martin Odersky that uses Scala&#x27;s implicit resolution to wire dependencies.
 As  indicated in a comment, however, this approach makes it awkward to separate the DI framework from service definitions. It occurred to me it would be easier to do so with an approach modeled on ZIO&#x27;s ZLayer. I&#x27;ve provided a POC along with a discussion in a gist:

                              <span>I&#x27;m upgrading an app from 2.12 to 2.13 and there&#x27;s a variable declaration with an arrow function that doesn&#x27;t throw an error but also isn&#x27;t getting called and I&#x27;m trying to understand what&#x27;s wrong with it, but my googling skills are failing me. Here&#x27;s is a pseudocode version of it:
  class { function(&quot;/route&quot;)(SourceParamsReads(Reads)) { println(&quot;a log here prints successfully&quot;) Params &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;no logs here or beyond print successfully&quot;) function(Params.session) { id &#x3D;&gt; val source &#x3D; Params.source val user &#x3D; ( groupId &#x3D; Params.groupId userId &#x3D; Params.userId ) val future &#x3D; ... future.map {...} } } 
 There&#x27;s more in the ellipses but hopefully this is enough information. the Params variable has no references anywhere else in the application, just before the arrow and inside it.

                              <span>I am a Doom Emacs user. I am trying to hide the habits consistency graph from a custom agenda view.
 I tried a few variations of the following to try to only affect this custom view (works for agenda-groups):
 lisp (agenda &quot;&quot; ( (org-habit-graph-column 0) (+org-habit-min-width 0) (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-start-day &quot;.&quot;) (org-super-agenda-groups nil) )) 
 Then I tried setting some variables globally hoping to suppress it:
 lisp (after! (org org-agenda) (setq! org-habit-graph-column 1 +org-habit-min-width 10 org-habit-preceding-days 1 org-habit-following-days 1 org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today t )) 
 Every time, the graph shows in agenda. When I check the variables while in the agenda view the values are not the ones I set in the config; org-habit-graph-column (which I was the most hopeful about if set below the value of +org-habit-min-width) for example is always set to 99.
 Thanks for your help.

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
I’ve done a scrappy demo for an application that allows you to publish your notes and actually build a following and income around them. If anyone has the time could you please take a look and fill out the form? The whole thing will take 5-10m. The link is - https://tally.so/r/3x2Do9
By the way, the video is made for people with no prior experience with note taking apps, so parts of it may be information you already know.
Thanks!</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I just updated from 29.3 to 29.4, and I found out that &quot;M-x restart-emacs&quot; now no longer starts up emacs again after closing it. Has anyone experienced the same issue?

I also keep a separate &quot;recreational reading&quot; list in NotePlan. How do you manage your list(s)?</span>

                              <span>Hi folks,
I&#x27;ve been using The Archive as my primary note-taking and knowledge-management tool for the last four years. It + the Zettelkasten method have been genuinely life-changing for me.
I wrote an essay on some of the specific reasons I love using The Archive so much. I&#x27;ve also shared some of the custom Alfred workflows and keyboard shortcuts I use to support The Archive, along with detailed examples.
I thought you all might enjoy the read!

Abusing Haskell: Executable Blog Posts by Sinan
I post my notes on my blog, Hashnode and dev.to, which require slightly different markdown formats. I have been doing the sane thing to fix formats so far. But it is a rainy Sunday and I am bored, so I decided to make this blog post an executable Haskell program to do the same.
Episode 54 – Dominic Orchard by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode, Wouter and Sam interview Dominic Orchard. Dominic has many roles, including: senior lecturer at the University of Kent, co-director of the Institute of Computing for Climate Science, and bye-fello…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a program where I have different kinds of events which share the same behavior and I&#x27;d like to store them together in a section with some other information . Is this possible to do in haskell or is there a better more idiomatic way to go about this? Here&#x27;s some pseudo code:
 data eventT1 … data eventT2 … class someClass where … instance someClass eventT1 where … instance someClass eventT2 where … data someData &#x3D; someData { foo :: int , bar :: [someClass] } main &#x3D; do let test &#x3D; someData { foo &#x3D; 1 , bar &#x3D; [eventT1, eventT2] } 
 The compiler complains the bar :: [someClass] part in the declaration of someData.

 I&#x27;ve seen people use a &#x60;--ghc-options&#x60; option when running &#x60;stack build&#x60;, but this same option does not work for me when I run &#x60;stack runghc --ghc-options -ddump-splices myfile.hs&#x60;. Anybody know the best way to achieve this?

                              <span>I have had an init file which I have been using for a few years now. Most of my custom configs are in an org file which is then tangled using org-babel. Up until today I though what happend was :
  
I start emacs, the init file runs 
 it gets to org-babel-load file (code below)
 init.el is generated from org
 init file gets evaluated
  
However, when I was installing on a new machine today, I noticed than not all of the lisp code from the org file was in the generated init.el. Did something change in the newer versions of emacs? (newest machine is 29.4)
 Or have I just been misunderstanding how it worked all this time?
 (org-babel-load-file
 (expand-file-name &quot;init.org&quot;
 &quot;~/.emacs.d/org&quot;)) 
 To resolve the issue I deleted the init.el file and restarted emacs, this time it generated and executed everything. Restarting alone made no difference.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using a Rocky 8 machine to which I don&#x27;t have root access.
 I&#x27;ve installed emacs-nox in my home directory using a combo of yum download, rpm2cpio and cpio.
 I can get it to start if I export EMACSDATA, EMACSLOADPATH and EMACSDIR, and it kinda works. It complains that it can&#x27;t find it&#x27;s arch-dependent data dir. I&#x27;ve looked for the environmental variable for this, but can&#x27;t find it. Does anyone know?

                              <span>Emacs makes use of a number of Linux-based command-line utilites, such as ls, grep, diff, and so on. However, recently I&#x27;ve started working for a company who has allowed me to have Emacs on my system, and have installed Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem for Linux on their Windows 10 systems.
 Unfortunately, sudo is not an option for my WSL instance, so there&#x27;s no way to add any components (including Emacs or any GUI functionality) to my WSL instance, so I can only download the native Windows portable version of Emacs.
 I know that you can use the WSL commands by prefacing them with bash -s, such as bash -s find -name filename.ext. However, I&#x27;m not sure where I can specify this to Emacs without going through the source to find all the variables containing the commands I need.
 To make this more complicated, I also make use of Vertico and consult (among the other components).
 Is there a single location where I can notify Emacs to add bash -s to the start of shell commands, or perhaps a list of variables that I can add to my .emacs.d tree?

                              <span>I am a newbie programmer and I am trying to get a good emacs config for Python. I am already pretty used to the key bindings and really like using emacs, however, I haven&#x27;t quite nailed down how to get a good linter and customize emacs for that purpose. Looking to see if anyone out there has a good setup and could give me some tips on where to start. I am mainly going to be running my scripts through a server so using the terminal version of emacs is where I have been spending most of my time. Any help would be appreciated !

                              <span>I am using emacs ver 29.4, org version 9.7.8.
 I am trying to export the matplotlib graphic to the same directory that the org files lives in:
 #+begin_src python :results graphics file output :file temp_plot_2.png import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x &#x3D; np.linspace(0, 10, 100) y &#x3D; np.sin(x) fig, ax &#x3D; plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y) #+end_src 
 The file is generated as expected, but ends up in the ~ directory.
 I checked the default-directory variable, and it is correctly set to the ~/images directory, where the org file lives, and where I want the graph (image) to go.
 When I use absolute paths in the :file argument (e.g., :file /home//images/temp_plot_2.png), it works as expected, but I don&#x27;t want to need to provide the absolute path every time.
 Anyone have any idea what&#x27;s going on, and why relative paths seem to not be working as expected?
 From the org manual, which seems to be in conflict with what I actually observe, since the directory associated with the current buffer is /home//images according to the local default-buffer variable, but file output is actually /home/:
  
The ‘dir’ header argument specifies the default directory during code block execution. If it is absent, then the directory associated with the current buffer is used.
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html
  
I tried specifying the dir header; didn&#x27;t work. I tried using M-x cd and navigating manually to the /home//images directory; didn&#x27;t work.
 Thanks

However, I want to ask about how do emacs users deal with this ?! I would have preferred that org agenda open these buffers silently and only show me the buffer that contains the todo I have selected. Is there a way to enable such a behavior ? Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I have read a few threads about this warning, but no detailled answer about how to deal with it.
 Please, correct me if I am wrong, but I understand it is a change in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; version 9.7 which throws a warning when the function is used in a non Org buffer. So, chances are that when the warning pops up, it is from an external package that has not conformed yet to that new rule/convention.
 Anyway, I get this warning every time I open the agenda time-grid, tall other built-in or custom views are working fine. This is not a terrible thing, but warnings are designed to be annoying, so I would like to get rid of it.
 Is pinning &#x60;org-mode&#x60; to a previous version the best way to go ? Any recommendation as to which version I should downgrade to ?
 I am a Doom Emacs user if it is relevant. Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>Not sure if this issue is specific to Doom emacs. When scrolling past any inline displayed image, the screen shifts down until the image gets completely out of frame, this sudden snap can be very distracting, especially with larger images, so i am asking for some type of workaround to fix this.
 Google searches only suggested pixel-scrolling options, which i tried and have not worked.
 ChatGPT told me to stop using images altogether lol.
 My version of doom emacs is a fairly new install with not much going on inside the configuration or packaging.

                              <span>Hi, I need to put an email address inside a org file that will be exported in HTML with Hugo. For privacy reasons, I need to encode it with HTML entities (like o@ etc.), but the HTML output I get is encoded (so it becomes &amp;#111;&amp;#064;).
 I put it between @@html:...@@ and worked great with the link description, but didn&#x27;t work at all with the link URL. What else can I try?
 I think this is mainly an issue with Hugo, but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s another way in org to set a string as literal.

                              <span>Hey everyone, in the recent months I got interested in Haskell and decided I&#x27;d start a small side project just to get the feeling of programming in Haskell.
 homodoro is what I came up with, a quite simple TUI program with some timers and an extremely simple task manager, I feel like I probably didn&#x27;t learn much about Haskell/FP in general while developing this but it was the most joy I ever felt while programming something and I&#x27;m quite happy with the result.
 All feedback is much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been researching how to use optimal evaluation to optimize Discrete Program Search and, eventually, I arrived at a simple algorithm that seems to be really effective. Based on the following tests:
 f 1001101110 &#x3D; 1010100110 f 0100010100 &#x3D; 1001101001 
 Solving for &#x27;f&#x27; (by search), we find:
 xor_xnor (0:0:xs) &#x3D; 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (0:1:xs) &#x3D; 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:0:xs) &#x3D; 1 : 0 : xor_xnor xs xor_xnor (1:1:xs) &#x3D; 0 : 1 : xor_xnor xs 
 My best Haskell searcher, using the Omega Monad, takes 47m guesses, or about 2.8s. Meanwhile, the HVM searcher, using SUP Nodes, takes just 1.7m interactions, or about 0.0085s. More interestingly, it takes just 0.03 interactions per guess. This sounds like a huge speedup, so, it is very likely I&#x27;m doing something dumb. As such, I&#x27;d like to ask for validation.
 I&#x27;ve published the Haskell code (and the full story, for these interested) below. My question is: Am I missing something? Is there some obvious way to optimize this Haskell search without changing the algorithm? Of course, the algorithm is still exponential and not necessarily useful, but I&#x27;m specifically interested in determining whether the HVM version is actually faster than what can be done in Haskell.

                              <span>This has been bugging me for a while, which probably says more about the occupational hazards of translating for a living than anything else. Does anyone actively disagree that Luhmann&#x27;s &quot;Register&quot; and similar documents in modern zettelkästen would naturally be called indexes in the absence of interference from the German word? If you disagree, what does the English word &#x27;register&#x27; mean to you, and in a zettelkasten context, how does it differ from an index? (I&#x27;m aware that Luhmann explicitly said his Register wasn&#x27;t meant to be exhaustive, but in my understanding an index doesn&#x27;t have to be either.)</span>

                              <span>bit of a crapshoot here, but thought i’d ask.
 im trying to get erc in emacs to scrub out ?ex to the end of the line in messages recieved. (mainly cos i use bitlbee as a bouncer via emacs cos my internet is slow as shit &gt;! 10mbit on a good day !&lt;) I can get embeds with erc-image. but not when they dont end in a normal image extension. 
 with all the tracking discord attachments have, i lose this.
 (use-package erc :init (defun erc-mention (match-type nickuserhost msg) (when (and (eq match-type &#x27;current-nick) (not (string-match &quot;^\\*\\*\\*&quot; msg))) (notify-send &quot;(IRC)&quot; (format &quot;PING! %s&quot; msg)))) (defun erc-clean-url (proc parsed) &quot;Clean trackers with ?ex from discord so enbeds properly work&quot; (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (when (re-search-forward &quot;\\?ex.*$&quot; nil t) (replace-match &quot;&quot;)))) :hook (erc-text-matched-hook . erc-mention) (erc-insert-modify-hook . erc-clean-url)) 
 This is what i&#x27;ve got and it doesnt seem to work, any ideas?

                              <span>I really like an emacs theme that I use, but in diff mode it is totally unreadable. I was wondering what the usual way of correcting this would be. Perhaps I could modify the overall theme but I&#x27;d be worried that it would ruin the aesthetics of the theme in other modes.

                              <span>This is kinda antithetical to the minimalist nature of nano but I still wanna try it. I want to replace the GNU Emacs / N Λ N O text with an ASCII art. I wonder if this is plausible since ASCII is technically just text. For reference, this is the ASCII art I want to use (specifically Lucy as the &#x27;doctor&#x27;).
 If this is simply not plausible in nano then I&#x27;m also up for alternative splash screen that can do this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get my Outlook work calendar accessible in emacs to escape the mess that is the outlook web interface, and came across excorporate. huge props to the author for getting an Exchange interface working! After a bit of trying out different configs I got it working with the OAuth 2.0 setup of my employer. 
 Now I&#x27;m trying to actually use it, but I find it somewhat unexpected; perhaps that&#x27;s because I have used org-gcal for a while and was expecting something similar, i.e. synchronizing of the calendar entries into an org file which can be linked to my org-agenda (and calfw).
 For example, a very frequent occurrence is to schedule meetings with other people (in person). This generally works by everybody looking at their calendar to find a spot in e.g. the next week where all of us are available. Is this possible with Excorporate? To me it seems it&#x27;s only possible to check the calendar entries for a given day (via M-x calendar, moving to the date, pressing d or e), but not get a list of all the events, or all the events in a week/month. 
 Furthermore, creating events seems to be possible via the API (https://github.com/emacsmirror/excorporate/blob/master/excorporate.info, chapter 6 API Usage), but this functionality is not exposed as an interactive function. Does that mean I have to write my own helper functions here? Has anybody done so already?
 Does anybody have experiences with excorporate for these use cases?

                              <span>I primarily do scientific work in python with code-cells.el and the ipython REPL. I like this workflow but, since I&#x27;m a subpar programmer, I often end up with giant and disorganized scripts which are difficult to navigate. I eventually delete the cruft and refactor but I still end up spending a lot of time in this disorganized state. To improve navigation through the spaghetti, I thought maybe a table of contents could be made from the code-cell headers (i.e. &quot;# %% Imports&quot;). Does something like this already exist? Is there some other quick solution involving, e.g., code folding, bookmarks, imenu, etc.? 
 If there&#x27;s no easy solution I thought this might be a good excuse to start playing with elisp and try implementing it myself. Any suggestions with respect to how to begin would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Edit: I changed the title from &quot;How do you take notes on claims attributed to secondary sources?&quot; to &quot;How to deal with unverified indirect claims?&quot;. @Andy pointed out that I am using the terms &quot;primary source&quot; and &quot;secondary source&quot; incorrectly. The distinction I was trying to make was between direct and indirect claims.
I&#x27;m currently working on taking more effective notes using the Zettelkasten method and have encountered a challenge when dealing with claims attributed to secondary sources.
For example, academic articles typically contain numerous references to outside sources. Many of the claims discussed are not original but rather derived from these secondary sources.
My struggle is with how to properly document these secondary claims in my notes when I&#x27;m unfamiliar with the sources being referenced. I feel uncomfortable directly citing them. However, these claims are often relevant and interesting, and I want to include them in my Zettelkasten for future reference.
Here are some questions I have:
How do you approach taking notes on claims that are attributed to secondary sources when using the Zettelkasten method?
Do you cite the original source, the secondary source, or both in your notes?
How do you ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation when you&#x27;re not directly familiar with the primary source?
Any strategies for efficiently exploring the primary sources when they seem particularly crucial to your understanding of the topic?
I’d appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you when navigating this aspect of academic note-taking. Thanks in advance!</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m reading  book on Manning MEAP website and have difficulties in understanding its chapter 21, titled &quot;Hello World! - introducing IO types&quot;. In my opinion, it seems to give wrong information. Below is an example:
 &quot;If main isn&#x27;t a function, it should follow that neither is putStrLn. ... As you can see, the return type of putStrLn is IO(). Like main, putStrLn is an IO action because it violates our rule that function must return values.&quot;
 The author seemed to think &quot;IO ()&quot; isn&#x27;t a value, which I don&#x27;t agree with. So I googled and found the following on Haskell wiki https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_Haskell_IO/Actions:
 &quot;PutStrLn takes an argument, but it is not an action. It is a function that takes one argument (a string) and returns an action of type IO (). So putStrLn is not an action, but putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; is.&quot;
 So I think the author is completely wrong on that, isn&#x27;t it? On the other hand, however, I read lots of good reviews on the book on Amazon website. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks for any confirmation or explanation.

                              <span>Howdy. 
 I&#x27;m trying to write a util function to clean up org-agenda items. Specifically, if an agenda item has a SCHEDULED and DEADLINE with matching date+time I would like to remove the SCHEDULED property. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come up with but though the messages indicate my logic is fine the changes are not being reflected in org-agenda view nor in the file where an item lives. Perhaps there&#x27;s some save function I&#x27;m not calling to persist the changes?
 (defun local/org-remove-schedule-if-deadline-matches () &quot;Remove SCHEDULED from agenda item if DEADLINE exists and matches.&quot; (interactive) (org-map-entries (lambda () (let ((scheduled (org-entry-get nil &quot;SCHEDULED&quot;)) (deadline (org-entry-get nil &quot;DEADLINE&quot;))) (when (and deadline scheduled) (let ((scheduled-day (org-time-string-to-absolute scheduled)) (deadline-day (org-time-string-to-absolute deadline))) (when (&#x3D; scheduled-day deadline-day) (message &quot;removing SCHEDULED from task: \&quot;%s\&quot; in file %s&quot; (org-get-heading t t t t) buffer-file-name) (org-entry-delete nil &quot;SCHEDULED&quot;) (save-buffer)))))) nil &#x27;agenda))

                              <span>Is it possible to automatically sync org files via Git similar to how it can be done via Dropbox. I can&#x27;t use dropbox in work laptop and I only have access to Git. I need to access files on Orgzly mobile app which does automatic sync even from Git.
 Possible options
  
Purely dropbox like which means it can sync files even if I open the files or not.
 Pull/merge when I open the file.

                              <span>I never touched emacs but want to start using it as a note-taking tool. I used a lot of zim wiki, it&#x27;s great but also very limiting and has all the cons of a retained-mode user interface.
 My question is what &quot;flavor&quot; of emacs should i use that best fits my needs?
 All i ask is rich text, image viewing support, linking to other notes/files, hierarchical notes and optionally a GUI.
 I don&#x27;t mind steep learning curves nor the specific type of rich text.

                              <span>Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts!
 I&#x27;ve noticed an interesting behavior difference between fill-paragraph in text-mode and org-fill-paragraph in org-mode, particularly when working with selected regions.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve observed:
  
In text-mode, fill-paragraph respects the selected region and only operates within it.
 In org-mode, org-fill-paragraph doesn&#x27;t seem to respect the selected region and operates on the entire paragraph.
  
I&#x27;ve created a GIF to illustrate this difference:
 https://i.redd.it/7trbpcthrqgd1.gif
 I initially thought this was a bug and submitted a report, but it was determined not to be one.
 I&#x27;d like to open this up for community discussion to get your thoughts and insights.
 In org-mode, the behavior remains the same whether a region is selected or not. When no region is selected, I believe this behavior is appropriate.
 However, the issue arises when a user explicitly selects a region, expecting the fill operation to be limited to that selection.
 I think org-fill-paragraph should respect the selected region, similar to how fill-paragraph works in text-mode.
 What do you think about this behavior?
  
Update: Now that I&#x27;ve reviewed the org-fill-paragraph function documentation again, I understand the current behavior.
  
The REGION argument is non-nil if called interactively; in that
 case, if Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active,
 fill each of the elements in the active region, instead of just
 filling the current element.&quot;
  
Unlike text-mode&#x27;s fill-paragraph, org-fill-paragraph is designed to &quot;fill each of the elements in the active region.&quot;
 The current behavior seems to be explained by this information.
 Thank you for your opinions!

                              <span>Apologies for the spam, but the sonatype API recently changed in a subtle way (it started erroring on &#x60;//&#x60;s in the URL which it previously ignored), and as a result all Mill builds publishing to Sonatype are failing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s getting fixed on the sonatype side, so I released a new Mill version that people will have to update to unblock themselves to continue publishing to sonatype:

 Trying to blast it broadly to reach the folks who are affected, sorry for the spam

                              <span>I gathered some popular Scala libraries into OSGi bundles. 
 https://gitlab.com/perikov/scala-bundles
 I tried this before ( https://github.com/p-pavel/osgi-scala ) wrapping every jar into a bundle, but I finally gave up.
 Everything is badly broken (split packages is the main problem).
 So I just taken a route on bundling releases (&quot;everything related to org.typelevel/cats/n&quot;).
 I also have Karaf features with dependencies. 
 For it lets me to just type &#x60;feature:install myApp&#x60; and have relevant libraries from cats ecosystem (and also elastic4s and others) just install transparently from maven. 
 and &#x60;feature:uninstall&#x60; just unloads everything.
 I&#x27;m not sure if I have to put all this on maven (maven central requires packaging sources with jars, and my jars are just bundles containing relevant libs).
 Is there any interest on this topic?

                              <span>In Scala 2.13, and play-json, I used the following pattern to serialize/de-serialize between case classes and Json:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} object WelcomeResult { implicit val format &#x3D; Json.format[WelcomeResult] } case class WelcomeResult(service: String) 
 defining implicit formatin the companion object of the case class, made it easily visible from outside, so the following code worked without even requiring an extra import:
 val welcome &#x3D; WelcomeResult(&quot;test&quot;) val json &#x3D; Json.toJson(welcome) 
 In Scala 3 I saw the type class derivation feature and though I could take advantage of it by a. making the code more compact. b. defining such a default formatting only once in a generic way in the type class.
 This is the implementation I have in mind:
 case class WelcomeResult(service: String) derives JsonFormat
 And then something like this in JsonFormat:
 import play.api.libs.json.{Format, Json} trait JsonFormat[T] { val format: Format[T] } object JsonFormat { def derived[T](using scala.deriving.Mirror.Of[T]): JsonFormat[T] &#x3D; { new JsonFormat[T]: override val format: Format[T] &#x3D; Json.format[T] } } 
 But Json.format[T] fails with some &quot;Instance not found: &#x27;Conversion[T, _ &lt;: Product]&#x27;&quot; error. I guess, from other examples that I need a macro to implement the desired behavior, but not sure how.
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>I read the following statement in this article - Direct-style Effects Explained. Does it mean one can accomplish the effect of e.g. ZIO, Cats without using those library? If so, apart from the examples Print, Raise/ Error, provided in the article. Any more examples that can be referred? Thanks
  
So direct-style effects and monad effects can be seen as just two different syntaxes for writing the same thing.

                              <span>In an org-ql-search in a code block, it is comfortable and easy to set a condition that a property has to have a certain string value. But how about number values? I have number values as properties and need to compare them: Is this value larger than 500, is it larger than 1400? But I cannot find a way to do this.
 I would be very grateful for any suggestions on how to find a solution path.

 any idea on how to make this work?
 edit: using DOOM emacs, saying for the rule and also to make things clear; i use org-modern outside all the doom packages related to org, nothing more

                              <span>I&#x27;m untrained in music, but every bit of music theory I learn really increases my enjoyment of it. I wanted to learn to compose a bit, and the traditional method is counterpoint. So I did what any barely musically literate nerd would do: I started to write a program to verify that a counterpoint composition follows the rules when played against a given melody. Frankly it was an uphill battle. But finally, this weekend, I got it working.
 https://github.com/ludflu/counterpointer-report
 The main thing that stymied my earlier efforts was that I didn&#x27;t understand the nature of musical intervals in a formal way. Every explanation I learned described it as a mathematically naive music student might require, which makes sense if I were trying to play the oboe or whatnot. Or, things would be explained in DSP terms, explaining how overtones work, etc. And that also makes sense, but....
 But what I really needed, was for someone to tell me that musical intervals are calculated using integers mod 12. Which actually makes a ton of sense when you think about how human&#x27;s perceive relative pitch. Did you know that humans are the only animals we know of that perceive relative pitch? I&#x27;m pretty sure I learned that from David Huron&#x27;s excellent book.
 Eventually I thought to ask someone over in /r/musictheory and things mostly worked out from there since I could use the Haskell modular-arithmetic library for the intervals, and Euterpea for representing notes and playing them via MIDI.
 Finally I had to hack around some broken stuff because Euterpea, though its a marvelous library, is not actively maintained and so needed some work to get it to run with modern Cabal. AND PortMIDI-haskell doesn&#x27;t agree with Clang on OSX. But I was able to patch all those things locally to get everything running, and I submitted PRs to try and fix them up for everyone else.

                              <span>Fellow PKM enthusiasts,
I find myself caught in what seems to be a cyclical dilemma in the world of personal knowledge management, and I&#x27;m curious if others are experiencing the same.
My journey began with enthusiasm for local-first environments like Obsidian and Logseq. The promise of data ownership and flexibility was alluring. However, as time passed, I found myself gravitating back to cloud-based solutions.
Now, I&#x27;m feeling the pull towards local files and Markdown again. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m caught in a perpetual swing between the convenience of the cloud and the freedom of local storage.
This pattern has me wondering:
Is this back-and-forth between local-first and cloud-based systems common in the PKM community?
For those who&#x27;ve made multiple switches, what ultimately made you settle on one approach (if you have)?
Are there solutions that effectively bridge this gap, offering the best of both worlds?
How do others manage the trade-offs between sync convenience and data sovereignty?
I&#x27;m starting to think this isn&#x27;t just a fleeting concern, but a fundamental tension in how we approach PKM. The desire for true ownership of our data and the freedom to use multiple tools seems to persist, even after trying various solutions.
Has anyone else found themselves in this PKM pendulum? How have you reconciled these competing needs in your own systems?</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone, sorry I couldn&#x27;t find a proper title for what I was looking for. what I want is a way for consult completion candidates to show a certain string when I&#x27;m selecting from the minibuffer but when the candidate is selected it should be the original form string.
 for example:
 ;; I have this list of paths that I want to select from (defvar paths &#x27;(&quot;/dir1/dir2/p1&quot; &quot;dir1/dir2/p2&quot; &quot;/dir1/dir2/p3&quot;)) ;; I want to parse those paths to only show the filename ;; in the minibuffer (consult--read (--map (file-name-nondirectory it) paths)) ;; the completion is supposed to be p1, p2, p3 ;; but when when I select I want the original path to be selected ;; for example /dir1/dir2/p1 
 I would do it using a hashmap or alist to map between the candidates and the selection.
 is there an easier way around this without using annotate function or marginalia ??

 I am tinkering with the github repo to make it a little bit more customized for my needs but other than that I praise its puristic and minimalistic ways. Its written in c and works smoothly over ssh (without tramp or sth.)

                              <span>Emacs beginner, started with spacemacs. I want to use spacemacs in terminal mode in my remote machine(Ubuntu) by doing ssh from my Mac. 
 How can I enable copy/yank from some text from my Mac browser into emacs buffer on the terminal and also vice versa. 
 I tried clipetty and it works when I yank something from emacs buffer and paste on Mac but not the other way around. Also it does not work at all when using tmux. 
 Appreciate any suggestions!!

                              <span>This question is mostly to those of you, who love or enjoy Scala (or not, but still visit this sub) but don&#x27;t get to use it at work, or use it only for Spark.
 Imagine that you&#x27;re given a task of creating a mission critical component of your company&#x27;s product. It would have to be a project deployed to the cloud, scalable, reliable, performant (but not extremely performant - jvm performance is fine). It will have to be maintained for years to come - by you, your team and your successors.
 Whatever you choose, you will have to recruit a team or train your coworkers - let&#x27;s assume that they are mostly java users, good old spring booters, but they are not against the idea of learning a new language and paradigm.
 Would you choose Scala for such a project if given a choice? Do you feel confident that you&#x27;d be able to sell this idea to your manager? Do you believe that with Scala it would be cheaper to maintain or more profitable than with other languages? When would it become profitable - the recruitment / trainings would be more expensive surely, so would benefits of Scala become visible after weeks, months, years of maintaining the product, or never at all?

                              <span>I stumbled upon a very toxic comment in this subreddit that somehow racked up 20 upvotes, and honestly, I was appalled by the sheer negativity of it.
 I get that everyone has their own opinions about coding, but flinging insults like that? That’s just not right.
 Can we please cut the negative rhetoric and start being more welcoming to EVERYONE, regardless of their skill level or coding style?
 The /r/scala subreddit should be a safe space for every Scala user. Labeling other people&#x27;s code as &quot;trash&quot; is not okay.
 That comment also fails to meet this community&#x27;s rules of &quot;decency&quot; and &quot;politeness.&quot; I&#x27;m very surprised that it received 20 upvotes.
 And can we please make full use of all the tools that reddit puts at our disposal? And let’s not turn a blind eye to this kind of behavior, we need to call it out. We can definitely do better. Thanks.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1ejjqa1/not_fully_understanding_type_inference_and/">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>Two dummy examples, both Scala 2.12. 
 First example - sequence of Foo[t &lt;: T], and I want some function to use that t somehow. Pseudocode-ish:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; type A &lt;: T type B &lt;: T
 trait Foo[t &lt;: T]
 object Foo1 extends Foo[A]
 objet Foo2 extends Foo[B]
 def someFunc[t &lt;: T](foo: Foo[t]): Unit &#x3D; { somethingThatKnowsHowToTakeTypes[t].foobar }
 Seq( Foo1, Foo2 ).map(someFunc) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This leads to type erasure concerns, even though to me it seems obvious that that Sequence is of a type where each object inside is a Foo of some concrete type that fits the constraints. I can get around it by introducing some wrapper case class that I can stick Foo1 and Foo2 into, which retains it&#x27;s type as an explicit member. And then inside someFunc I have to manually use that type member explicitly. Feels clunky and it feels like something I&#x27;m tricking the compiler into doing. Not to mention at some point I did get it to compile, only to fail at runtime if I didn&#x27;t create the correct implicit typetag in scope.
 Second example:
 Sequence of (Foo[t &lt;: T], Bar[t &lt;: T]), and Bar/Foo have methods that operate on or return t &lt;: T. I store in a 2-tuple because inside a lambda I want to do something like Foo.read(...).map(Bar.transform) where Foo.read returns something typed by t and Bar.transform takes something subtyped by t. I assume since I pair them up in a 2-tuple, the Seq of these such objects could recognize that it&#x27;s some paired object, but instead the compiler complains about expected vs supplied types.

                              <span>Hey all, this is a follow up post to this post with an amazing title.
 I am writing this so it doesn&#x27;t just exist on my laptop and is documented somewhere. Maybe this is common knowledge, I did not find it anywhere.
 Basically, update from my end on the direction Monoidal -&gt; Traversing is that there&#x27;s a way to write
 monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (f a) (f b) 
 we use a variation of Alexis King&#x27;s construction
 data Traversal a r b &#x3D; Done b | Yield a !(Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) deriving Functor instance Applicative (Traversal a r) where pure &#x3D; Done Done f  a &#x3D; f  a Yield a rToTf  ta &#x3D; Yield a ((\ f b x -&gt; f x b)  rToTf  ta) traversal :: Traversable t &#x3D;&gt; t a -&gt; Traversal a b (t b) traversal &#x3D; traverse (\ a -&gt; Yield a (Done id)) unTraversal :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Traversal a b tb -&gt; tb unTraversal _ (Done tb) &#x3D; tb unTraversal morph (Yield a fab) &#x3D; unTraversal morph (fmap ($ morph a) fab) traversalP :: (Choice p, Monoidal p) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (Traversal a b x) (Traversal b b x) traversalP &#x3D; dimap toEither fromEither . right&#x27; . (both  id  traversalP) where toEither :: Traversal a r b -&gt; Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) toEither (Done x ) &#x3D; Left x toEither (Yield a resume) &#x3D; Right (a, resume) fromEither :: Either b (a, Traversal a r (r -&gt; b)) -&gt; Traversal a r b fromEither (Left x ) &#x3D; Done x fromEither (Right (a, resume)) &#x3D; Yield a resume monoidalToTraversing :: (Choice p, Monoidal p, Traversable f) &#x3D;&gt; p a b -&gt; p (f a) (f b) monoidalToTraversing &#x3D; dimap traversal (unTraversal id) . traversalP 
 (I call both :: p a b -&gt; p c d -&gt; p (a,c) (b,d) to Monoidal&#x27;s idiomatic class function) the other direction (Traversing -&gt; Monoidal) needs some other kind of ideas which I am not having so far.
 Remaining questions:
  
What about the other direction?
 How to do this for Traversing1? It shouldn&#x27;t use Choice, because Either a is not a Traversable1
 What are the implications?

                              <span>I mostly run Emacs 29.4 (from source) but on some machines I run Emacs 28.2 (Debian 12) and Emacs 27.1 (Debian 11). I&#x27;ve recently started seeing errors on Emacs 27.1 with consult-buffer and consult-ripgrep among others in Git repositories:
 No applicable method: project-roots, (projectile . &quot;/full/path/to/git/root&quot;) 
 and the commands no longer work. I don&#x27;t see these errors in newer Emacs versions.
 Am I out of luck trying to run modern packages on Emacs 27 or is it possible that I&#x27;ve got something configured incorrectly?
 Thanks.

 if I have #+title: python:getting command in ubuntu then org-roam-find-node can list it
 if I have #+title:python:getting command in ubuntu then org-roam-find-node cannot list it
 Both ways, the python:getting command in ubuntu are highlighted with org-document-title face, so I think (I could be wrong) that org-mode parses both way alright(or is it font-lock and parser behave differently?). but the space will make that huge difference to org-roam-find-node
 Why?

                              <span>My main gripe are
  
I&#x27;m not always logged into reddit, and when I click a reddit link, it produces some fake security error, and tells me I&#x27;m not logged in or I should use my developer token. I&#x27;m not sure why reddit has started to do this, but does it have something to do a desire to monetize it it more, and may even have something to do with AI. It seems reddit has also signed some exclusive deal with Google allowing only Google to index it.
 
The way Reddit know handles blocking by other users. Sometime ago I began to notice that so many responses had some error like deleted and unavailable. Something I remarked on in this thread - Why do some reddit users especially on r/emacs keep messing up threads their involved by deleting their posts or making them unavailable? I don&#x27;t see why some people should disrupt a technical discussion by blocking some participants who can&#x27;t see what is going. It is not as though this Twitter or Facebook, this is simply a technical forum and the discussions don&#x27;t often veer into the political. What kind of mindset does it take to block someone because you don&#x27;t want them to read your views on technical issues, and it is not as though the person blocked cannot login using another account to see the thread?
 
 These two issues are making this forum less appealing. Perhaps I should use stackexchange more instead.

                              <span>Hello,
 I need to find the nth prime number. This is what I have so far:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -&gt; Maybe Integer nth n | n  Bool isPrime 2 &#x3D; True isPrime n | n  n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0)) [2..root] where root &#x3D; (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral) n 
 Some of the errors I get are (seems that both functions are wrong):
 Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘Int’ • In the expression: x In the first argument of ‘(!!)’, namely ‘[x | x  Bool Actual: [Int] -&gt; [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -&gt; n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0))’Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘[Bool]’ with ‘Bool’ Expected: [Int] -&gt; Bool Actual: [Int] -&gt; [Bool] • In the first argument of ‘all’, namely ‘(map (\ x -&gt; n &#x60;mod&#x60; x /&#x3D; 0))’ 
 The second error is not really clear for me, I thought that all returns Bool (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool), why would it be [Bool]? Also, any hint for the first function? Thank you.
 EDIT:
 Correct solution:
 module Prime (nth) where nth :: Int -&gt; Maybe Integer nth n | n  Bool isPrime n &#x3D; null [x | x &lt;- [2..n-1], n &#x60;mod&#x60; x &#x3D;&#x3D; 0]

                              <span>Almost any resource I read recently says that GHCI should show &quot;Prelude&gt;&quot; as prompt after start. And the prompt should change e.g. to &quot;*Main&gt;&quot; after loading a .hs file.
 In my case GHCi only shows &quot;ghci&gt;&quot; as prompt. Has this changed recently or am I doing something wrong here?

                              <span>I&#x27;m just stumbled over a case where I had something like
 val foo1 &#x3D; bar[TypeA]() val foo2 &#x3D; bar[TypeB]() val foo3 &#x3D; bar[TypeC]() def bar[T:AContextBound](): String &#x3D; ??? 
 I wonder - is there way to write it as something like
 val fooList:List[String] &#x3D; forAllTypes( ???[TypeI] &#x3D;&gt; bar[TypeI]()) 
 I have not a clue how the function definition would even look like. It would only save few lines, but it got me fascinated if there is some deeper scala magic I&#x27;m not aware of yet.

 Is there a better way to do this without manually adding this to every line?

                              <span>I am trying to create an agenda that lists only todos associated with a particular person or list of people. I am attempting to use org-ql-defpred with org-ql-query, and because I do not quite have a handle on what I am doing yet (I am far from an elisp expert, but don&#x27;t mind stretching my boundaries), I am trying to stick pretty close to the Org QL Custom Predicates Tutorial for now.
 Something that works exactly as I want, but lacks the flexibility of the predicate-based approach, is the following (with org-super-agenda):
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;A&quot; . &quot;Agendas&quot;) (&quot;Aj&quot; &quot;John&quot; ((org-ql-block &#x27;(tags &quot;#John&quot;) ((org-ql-block-header &quot;John&quot;))))) 
 To move to the predicate-based method, I define my predicate as follows (identical to the tutorial, save for concatenating &quot;#&quot; instead …</span>

                              <span>Hi, so far I have written the following configuration for lsp, but emacs is telling me that lsp-haskell-server-path is a free variable, but when I try to manually install lsp-haskell with (use-package lsp-haskell :ensure t :config lsp-haskell-server-path &quot;

 Thank you before, for all helpful answers.

 Successfully starts and connects to a local pylsp when editing a local file - but is unsuccessful in starting a remote pylsp when TRAMPing a remote file. Exits with error: (:message &quot;Connection state changed&quot; :change &quot;exited abnormally with code 127\n&quot;)
  
 Local machine is windows running putty - TRAMP connection /plink:server:/temp/test.py
 Remote machine is FreeBSD 13.2 running sshd and samba.
 
&quot;Local&quot; editing (and pylsp) via samba share works, but with pylsp running on the local windows machine and test.py on the remote samba share editing is slow and is not optimal.
  
Any suggestions on having option 3. work for both local and remote pylsp?

                              <span>I have been messing around with the LaTeX export system and have been able to get my shell blocks to export to latex w/ this formatting, including automatically adding the \StartConsole command to any first line in a command. It would be nice to have the results and the shell commands joined in the output so that it looks exactly like a command and its output looks like in a terminal. I am not sure how to go about merging them in the latex output though and whether it should be done as pre- or post- processing. Any help figuring this out would be very appreciated. Thank you.
 In case anybody is interested, I did this using the org-9.8pre version with its new export features and used the following relevant code...

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 recently I&#x27;ve had some trouble with Doom Emacs crashing unexpectedly and I&#x27;ve been trying to troubleshoot today with research and chatgpt.
 I found on r/DoomEmacs a similar thread where an Arch user was experiencing the same thing while editing C++ files while mine was mostly happening when editing Rust files. I don&#x27;t have much to go on but my assumption was that when the rust-analyzer was working or Rust LSP was communicating it was causing it to panic and crash but this was just an assumption and I was having trouble getting much out of --debug-init. This user was able to downgrade to version 29.3 and it solved their problems.
 Recently I&#x27;ve completely uninstalled rust, emacs and doom emacs and found wayland-emacs on the aur which I didn&#x27;t notice last time. I&#x27;ve reinstalled Rust and now I&#x27;m going to attempt to install this AUR package and go from there. Another issue I was having was opening Fish shell in Doom Emacs with Term which wasn&#x27;t an issue before until installing Rust.
 It&#x27;s also important to note that I&#x27;ve had this Arch + Hyprland install for about 2 weeks and Doom Emacs hasn&#x27;t given any issues what so ever until installing rust and rust-analyzer but also I upgraded around the same time and I know there was an upgrade 2 days ago. Thanks for reading, I wanted to try and be thorough so I apologize for the length of this.
 P.S The user on Arch I was talking about with a similar issue was using X11
 EDIT: solved, I use the pacaman package manager to uninstall emacs-wayland and installed emacs instead. So far rust hasn&#x27;t crashed when editing or coding rs files in doom and rust-analayzer is working. Must install with rustup component add rust-analyzer though, not your package manager. and using vterm this time with no issues.. yet ;)

If you want to replace a piece of text without writing the deleted text to the register (in other words, you only want to delete the text, not cut it), so that you can continuously replace a piece of text in multiple places. If you don&#x27;t want to use any plugins and want to solve this directly through vim commands, the method is to first select the text and then enter the command &quot;ay, which copies this text to the a register. Then, for the text you want to replace, first select it and then enter &quot;ap, which replaces the selected text with the text in register a.
 The above operation is obviously cumbersome. Previously, I used the evil-replace-with-register plugin to solve this problem. This plugin provides a command bo…</span>

I run my own little branding &amp; design agency, and when I decided to start writing blog posts I found myself falling down rabbit holes of psychology, Jung, archetypes, consciousness, and on. I realized that I needed a better way to hold on to and integrate all the new ideas I was finding — which led me to a new rabbit hole of Zettelkasten and trying to understand the philosophies and processes behind it.
Many of my web searches would lead me to thoughtful discussions on this forum, so I thought I&#x27;d tag along and try to absorb your collective knowledge!
I&#x27;d already been using Obsidian, but I recently started a new vault so I could use it more correcter.</span>

                              <span>Yet another wasm question!
 I&#x27;m trying to compile a cabal project using the ghc-wasm-meta 9.8 compiler, but I&#x27;m getting the following error:
 wasm-ld: error: unable to find library -lHSrts-1.0.2_thr 
 my cabal.project and each name.cabal have the following ghc-options:
 program options/library ghc-options: -no-hs-main -optl-mexec-model&#x3D;reactor &quot;-optl-Wl&quot; 
 something I noticed is that if I run build using --verbose , the call to wasm32-wasi-ghc doesn&#x27;t have any of the ghc-options I&#x27;ve set. Maybe it&#x27;s got something to do with the &#x60;Setup.hs&#x60;? but that file just has the usual:
 import Distribution.Simple main &#x3D; defaultMain 
 Anybody got an idea of what might be happening?

                              <span>For years (I use AoC as way to get familiar with new languages I add to my trophy collection), I&#x27;ve been used to that naive solutions for AoC2015/4 (iterate over numbers, conver to string, concatenate with prefix, hash, convert to hex, check n zero prefix, repeat) take &#x27;too long&#x27;.
 The first optimization was to figure out how to pre-hash the prefix (in some languages/libs, copying the state is not as straightforward as calling a method).
 Second was not converting a number to string, but incrementing a byte array (or mutable string) representation of the number.
 The last is to re-use a buffer for the resulting hash, ideally not converted to hex, and to directly check the first few bytes (and perhaps 4 bits) to be zero.
 Usually, all this got me a speed-up of at least 10x.
 What totally shocked me was that the naive implementation finished in less then five seconds (I expected roughly a minute), and that further optimizations got it down only to under three seconds.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;d like to invite all of you to another episode of the Scala Space Podcast. Today my guests will be:
  
Matthieu Baechler, french Scala engineer and freelancer who worked on the migration of rudder.io software
 Łukasz Krenski, polish Scala engineer working at MeWe, responsible for migration of their stack to Scala 3
  
Our topics will include the difficult parts of the migration, the ways to deal with them, what to pay attention to when migrating to Scala 3 and finally - whether it&#x27;s worth it!
 The podcast will be happening, as usual, live on Twitch and Scala Space Youtube channel today at 14:00 CEST so feel free to join the chat and ask questions. Links:

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Scala. I&#x27;m writing some performance-sensitive code for processing objects on several axes. My actual code is more complicated and handles more axes, but it&#x27;s structured like this:
 class Processor: xData: Data yData: Data zData: Data def process(axis: Axis) &#x3D; axis match case X &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(xData) case Y &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(yData) case Z &#x3D;&gt; doStuff(zData) 
 But it is a bit repetitive, and it&#x27;s easy to make a typo and use the wrong data object. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to write something like this
 class Processor: data: HashMap[Axis, Data] def process(axis: Axis) &#x3D; doStuff(data(axis)) 
 Unfortunately, this code has different performance and correctness characteristics:
  
It&#x27;s possible for me to forget to initialize Data for some of the axes. In a language like TypeScript I could type the field as Record, which would check at compile time that keys for all axes are initialized. But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible in Scala.
 Accessing the map requires some hashing and dispatching. However fast they may be, my code runs millions of times per second, so I want to avoid this and really get the same performance as accessing the field directly.
  
Is it possible to do something like this in Scala?
 Thanks!

 Is there a possibility to have abbreviated journal titles in citations?

I didn&#x27;t realize Boon wasn&#x27;t visual like Meow and Kakoune, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have created this post. Boon pays attention to ergonomics though, which according to this, isn&#x27;t something that any of the example Meow layouts do. I guess I&#x27;ll try to create an ergonomic layout for Meow in the future.

                              <span>This was useful for a few people I work with, so I&#x27;m posting it here for posterity. My job involves switching computers pretty frequently, and so I have everything set up with use-package&#x27;s :ensure keyword so I can just clone my init.el to a new machine, and Emacs will download all my packages automatically. In general, this works great; the exception is org. 
 Any kind of :ensure form doesn&#x27;t work with installing the latest revision of org (afaik), because the pre-installed version shadows it; use-package uses package-installed-p to decide if a package isn&#x27;t installed and needs to be downloaded, and since org is always installed, no download will ever trigger. This is fine, up until you want something from a later version of org.
 A while back, I reported a bug that interfered with my org…</span>

                              <span>So someone at my company years ago decided it was a good idea to create a company internal package format, say &quot;yuppie&quot; for yunified package. And that can randomly be tgz or zip archives. Don&#x27;t ask.
 Now I need some &#x27;yuppie-mode&#x27; function that dispatches to either archive-mode or jka-compr and then tar-mode.
 Any ideas? suggestions how to solve this?
 currently I&#x27;m creating symlinks from file --mime-type output and then open the file, but that is a hack, not a solution :-/

                              <span>I have been scratching my head for a while now about how to handle task dependencies in Orgmode.
 First off, I am aware of &#x60;org-depend&#x60; and &#x60;org-edna&#x60; as well as the &#x60;ORDERED&#x60; property. I am trying to find a way to make them work for a common, but specific type of dependency.
 Task Dependencies
 As defined in this [blog page][1] from the &#x27;projectmanager.com&#x27; website, a Gantt chart will define 4 types of dependency. I find two of them essential in my task management workflow.
 Finish to finish
 The first one, and most commn I think, is the **finish-to-finish dependency** which is the one I believe is covered by org-mode; this is also the easiest to enforce (again imho) programatically with orgmode tools. Task A cannot be marked as &#x60;DONE&#x60; before task B and C are.
 It is what &#x60;org-enforce-tod…</span>

 what I would like to have is something like this:
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal (kbd &quot;C-bC-b&quot;) &#x27;my-func)
 Is that possible? If so how? I&#x27;ve noticed that  would trigger my-func after the first C-b, and if I change the third prefix to something else the issue persists. I&#x27;d like to have it triggered after the second C-b.

 I use emacs 29.4 and mostly I use it for C, C++, LaTeX and planing use it for clojure, haskell and common-lisp. For first two I use clangd-lsp with next emacs packages:
  
lsp-mode
 lsp-ui
 company-mode
 flycheck 
  
As you understand above, I use only company for autocomplete. I want to provide in my emacs yasnippet, mostly because of latex. But for some reason, firstly, it wasn&#x27;t working with company-mode: in company-autocomplete-box i didn&#x27;t have any of my snippets, but autocomplete by keybinding, which I provide in yasnippet config part, have been working. It was in all modes which I using. I research all internet, and just find config in this discussion, which really help me. And all is working fine in c-mode and c++-mode, but not for latex.

                              <span>Whenever I build a new version of Emacs from source, I generate PDFs from the texinfo files located in the source repository&#x27;s doc directory to have up-to-date documentation that I can easily read from tablet or smartphone. I find it more convenient than the HTML versions.
 This is done by running make pdf.
 However, these PDFs don&#x27;t have hyperlinks or clickable TOC.
 Only the major manuals released here, like the GNU Emacs Manual, the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual and An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp seem to offer that functionality.
 Any idea how to get it done for all the other manuals?
 EDIT:
 Problem solved. I overlooked that the hyperlinks work fine. They&#x27;re just not highlighted.

 I previous displayed a file buffer in this window, then I switched to another tab-bar, when I come back I see this.
 Why? What&#x27;s this, How to prevent it. Is there some variable or function can control related behavior?

                              <span>During the closing of bug#71801 a Windows build was uploaded to the GNU FTP which was shipped with libgccjit-0.dll. If that DLL is present, then Emacs will try to native compile the 3rd party packages. If it fails to do so then it will throw an error, and it will stop loading the 3rd party packages. One user complained on the mailing list about this, and a new release was uploaded to the GNU FTP without this DLL.
 The issue is that the Windows package managers already downloaded and hashed the build with libgccjit-0.dll the first time it was uploaded. Winget had a hash mismatch, but should be fixed since then. Chocolatey does not know about the new file, and it will download the build with libgccjit-0.dll in it.

 I started a business a couple of months ago, and using a spreadsheet as a crm + sales pipeline wasn&#x27;t very satisfactory. I needed a CRM system that can basically do the following:
  
Maintain a list of companies and the contacts in each of them
 Maintain a list of ongoing leads and opportunities, and qualify each one as the deal state changes
 Keep email communications for each opportunity attached to the lead and the company / contact
 Maintain a list of upcoming tasks related to each opportunity
  
I looked into a few CRMs and found most to be quite expensive. I didn&#x27;t want to spend on yet another subscription this early in the business. Some free ones like Hubspot that are too complex for my needs. S…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been diving into the world of algebraic effects systems as an alternative to mtl-style classes for granular effect tracking. One thing I haven&#x27;t quite figured out yet is how to handle errors in the middle of a computation that uses a custom effect type. For example, let&#x27;s say I have an effect for talking to the database:
  data DB :: Effect where DBWrite :: Item -&gt; DB m () DBRead :: Key -&gt; DB m (Maybe Item) 
 and types for errors and the database environment
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data DBError &#x3D; DeadLockError | ConnectionError
 data DBEnv &#x3D; DBEnv Connection &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and let&#x27;s say I have the interpreter:
  runDBIO :: (IOE :&gt; es, Error DBError :&gt; es) &#x3D;&gt; DBEnv -&gt; Eff (DB : es) a -&gt; Eff es a runDBIO env &#x3D; interpret \_ -&gt; \case ... do handling here ... 
 Now the recommended way to instrument all of this is to wire up all of your effect handlers at the start of your program:
  main &#x3D; do env  ... do something ... Right -&gt; ... do something ... 
 This all makes sense. But what if I want to handle the error at a deeper level in the program and not at the very top level? The Error DBError effect doesn&#x27;t manifest in the type list until the runDBIO interpreter is applied. For example,
  tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage :: Item -&gt; Eff [Email, DB] () tryWriteDBOrSendEmailPage item &#x3D; do catchError (dbWrite item) $ \_ e -&gt; emailPage $ &quot;Something went wrong: &quot; ++ (show e) return () 
 This doesn&#x27;t work here because the type signature doesn&#x27;t contain Error DBError, but the underlying implementation of DB uses it. If I add Error DBError to the effect list, wouldn&#x27;t that be a totally separate effect from DB, so it wouldn&#x27;t be able to throw and catch in the same context? Should I manually expose effects for TryDBWrite and TryDBRead that return an Either? Not exactly sure what to do here.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am trying to learn Slick in Play,
 I was making a toy application, But I am not getting code generation support while writing queries in Slick,
 For details, I am using metals in VS code, Intellij is working better but takes up whole resources in WSL 10 gigs
 My code is something like this
 @Singleton class SessionStoreDao @Inject()(protected val dbConfigProvider: DatabaseConfigProvider)(implicit executionContext: ExecutionContext) { val dbConfig &#x3D; dbConfigProvider.get[PostgresProfile] import dbConfig._ import profile.api._ val sessionStore &#x3D; TableQuery[SessionStore] } 
 for an example: when I type
 sessionStore dot it doesn&#x27;t show available methods, I need it as I am new to slick
 I am clueless why is it so? I tried searching everything.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked on many systems built with all sorts of languages from Python and Scala, at the end of the day, they kinda of have the same level of bugs in production. Given that to release something to production we write lots of tests, these tests catch the problems, hopefully, before they hit production. What is your experience with that? My main concern behind this question is if it&#x27;s worth to pursue a more strict style of Scala with FP given the complexity and time to onboard new hires.

                              <span>Hi Everyone l,
 I have a somewhat weird scenario. I have been invited for a code review interview round with a company that works primarily on scala and a bit on Java. I am a Java resource and have never worked on scala before but they have told me that they are okay to hire people with Java knowledge as they have a pretty decent upskilling plan. However the code review is on a scala code. My question is as a senior Java dev how can I deal with this. I was thinking I will brush up on a few core concepts of functional programming and monads. Anything else you guys suggest. The recruiter said that they ofcourse know that I have never worked on scala so I will be judged accordingly but I am sure there will still be some stuff that I can do.

                              <span>SOLVED: eshell-highlight-prompt being set to nil caused the behavior. Setting to true fixes the issue, which makes me wonder why the setting is used in the repository at all.
 I am excited to start using Eshell after reading about it on Mastering Emacs. Since I wasn&#x27;t happy with default prompt, I installed the eshell-prompt-extras package like the article recommended. However, if I continue pressing backspace, my prompt and previous shell output can be deleted, which is not the correct behavior.
 I understand eshell-prompt-regexp has to match the prompt and I think it does because C-a takes me to the correct place after the prompt. Since Eshell doesn&#x27;t use comint-mode, I don&#x27;t know of a function to make the prompt read-only. Is there any way to achieve the desired behavior?
 My Eshell prompt customization settings are copied and pasted from https://github.com/zwild/eshell-prompt-extras:
 (with-eval-after-load &quot;esh-opt&quot; (autoload &#x27;epe-theme-lambda &quot;eshell-prompt-extras&quot;) (setq eshell-highlight-prompt nil eshell-prompt-function &#x27;epe-theme-lambda))

                              <span>I recently started playing around with stuff to figure out how loading libraries/autoloading works (so this isn&#x27;t for any practical purpose, just didactic), and I&#x27;m at the end of my rope trying to figure out where some documentation is coming from. For some reason, no matter what source files I change, inspecting autoloads with symbol-function returns documentation that seemingly isn&#x27;t on my system anymore.
 Here&#x27;s the setup: start emacs with emacs -Q, and then immediately run:
 (setq help-enable-completion-autoload nil help-enable-autoload nil) 
 If you do C-h f org-agenda, you get the documentation for org-agenda, but if you then inspect C-h v load-history, you can see that nothing org-related has been loaded yet. Evaluating (symbol-function &#x27;org-agenda) reveals how the documentation can…</span>

                              <span>I was wondering if there&#x27;s a plugin which can do similar job like vs code file explorer where it automatically detects the depth of a file and shortens it to a single level.For example if we have com/example/activity it won&#x27;t show the tree but it will shorten it to one level.

                              <span>Given a frame with various windows in it, I want to be able to write text into them without them being associated with a file, and I don&#x27;t want to spam buffers into the buffer list. I was thinking that having a single &quot;log buffer&quot; into which the messages would be written would prevent buffer spamming, and then I could just show the operator a different particular message in each window. Playing around with different things, trying to use indirect buffers with some sort of region narrowing seemed to be a good possible option.
 I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this though:
  (let ((org-dates (list &quot;2020-04-05&quot; &quot;2023-08-02&quot; &quot;2021-09-08&quot; &quot;2019-08-04&quot;))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (split-window-right) (balance-windows) (dolist (earlier-journal-entry org-dates) (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*Org Roam Daily Reflection Log*&quot;) (generate-new-buffer-name &quot;*indirect*&quot;))) (let* ((start (point)) (org-msg (concat &quot;\n\n* No daily journal entry for &quot; earlier-journal-entry &quot;.&quot;))) (insert org-msg) ;; (org-mode) (narrow-to-region start (point))))) 
 In particular, the narrowing doesn&#x27;t seem to work right. How should I be doing narrowing?
 (If this is at all the right sort of approach to this task.)

 hunspell, ispell, aspell, nuspell, enchant, and the duck knows what else is out there for this shit.
 So, I&#x27;m using minad/jinx, which is absolutely excellent, and if you&#x27;re not using it, you&#x27;re such a schlub, drop whatever you&#x27;re doing right now and try it. 
 Now, jinx uses enchant, okay? And on my Linux machine it works beautifully. I don&#x27;t remember how I did it, what exactly have I installed, but it just works. I would open a buffer with English text, it highlights things mistyped in English. I would open a buffer with Russian text - it highlights errors in Russian. Moreover, I can type th…</span>

I&#x27;m not actually sure how the popularity metric is derived, but I think it&#x27;s based on users who indicated that they had &quot;done extensive development work in over the past year&quot;. Scala is at 2.6% of all respondents, slightly down from 2.77% last year. Among respondents who are professional developers it&#x27;s 2.9%, down from 3.21% last year. Among those still learning to code it&#x27;s 1.7%, way up from 0.77% last year.
 If I had to put some flavor on these numbers I&#x27;d say Scala is still at the top of the long tail of languages. It comes in about 20th among programming languages (ie. I ignored SQL, HTML, bash, etc.) so certainly still relevant. Movement from last year is negligible except for new developers, which is very cool.

How does scala fare in that department?
 Thanks in advance for your response.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had ‘A System for Writing’, the new book by Bob Doto, on my desk since yesterday.
Before I read a new book, I&#x27;m interested in how it relates to the books I&#x27;ve read so far. To get an initial overview, I simply create a new Reference Note for the book in my Zettelkasten. It consists of a brief description of the book and a few references to existing notes.
When I quickly look through the bibliography, I find these references. They are links to books that I have already read or to books that are on my reading list. These are simply added to link the Reference Note. The graphical overview is generated automatically by the Zettelkasten tool.

Figure: Local Graph for &quot;A System for Writing - Bob Doto&quot;
The resulting literature map helps to provide an initial overview. By adding a few details, the map becomes somewhat easier to read as a concept map.

Figure: Concept Map created from bibliographic details
The concept map will be refined further. Quotations and ideas from the existing &#x27;Reference Notes&#x27; make the &#x27;Bibliographic Map&#x27; easier to read. It now offers a good overview that facilitates the overall understanding of this bibliographic network.

Figure: Extended Concept Map with time axis created from bibliographic details
My learning: The notes in my Zettelkasten benefit from being reduced in size (digital: 500 words or analogue: 5x7&quot; paper size). One note, one idea.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had ‘A System for Writing’, the new book by Bob Doto, on my desk since yesterday.
Before I read a new book, I&#x27;m interested in how it relates to the books I&#x27;ve read so far. To get an initial overview, I simply create a new Reference Note for the book in my Zettelkasten. It consists of a brief description of the book and a few references to existing notes.
When I quickly look through the bibliography, I find these references. They are links to books that I have already read or to books that are on my reading list. These are simply added to link the Reference Note. The graphical overview is generated automatically by the Zettelkasten tool.

Figure: Local Graph for &quot;A System for Writing - Bob Doto&quot;
The resulting bibliographic map helps to provide an initial overview. By adding a few details, the map becomes somewhat easier to read as a concept map.

Figure: Concept Map created from bibliographic details
The concept map will be refined further. Quotations and ideas from the existing &#x27;Reference Notes&#x27; make the &#x27;Bibliographic Map&#x27; easier to read. It now offers a good overview that facilitates the overall understanding of this bibliographic network.

My learning: The notes in my Zettelkasten benefit from being reduced in size (digital: 500 words or analogue: 5x7&quot; paper size). One note, one idea. But all the connections of my networked notes remain invisible. They are represented by simple hyperlinks on each note. Understanding context means having visibility of these networks. Using Concept Maps with an infinite canvas size is a great help.

                              <span>Hey everybody, just wanted to bring some attention to a library I am working on.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htmx
 This is roughly based on &#x60;lucid-htmx&#x60;, but is different enough that I think it can be considered stand alone and not a fork. Notable differences:
  
Not using the old &#x60;data&#x60; based tags
 New type-safe interfaces for various htmx enumerations
 Module structure tries to follow some htmx concepts (like core and extra attributes)
 Significant documentation
 Additional attributes that didn&#x27;t exist in &#x60;lucid-htmx&#x60;
  
I am going to try and stay active on the issue tracker, and keep this package up to date with new GHC indexes. Hope this is useful to some of you.

 More or less satisfied so far, but may be there are some tips i just don&#x27;t know about.
 What i really want is ability to verically align &quot;::&quot; and &quot;&#x3D;&quot; on function declaration, like in snippet below (dots mean spaces). Or at least vertically align on &quot;&#x3D;&quot;
 func .......:: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
 func 1 y ....&#x3D; 10 + y
 func 100 yyy &#x3D; 1000 + yyy
 funv _ _ ....&#x3D; -1

 How can I use orgmode to get citations in the form
 Smith, Wu, …, Miller (2023) Nature
 i.e. First Author, Second Author, ..., Last Author (year) Journal
 (This is my preferred form to cite things in presentations in life science field.)
 I am having a hard time reading the corresponding section in the manual trying to extract the necessary information.
 Ideally, I could dynamically decide on how many authors to cite &#x27;at each end&#x27;.
 Any solution using CSL or biblatex as drivers would be highly appreciated!

                              <span>In my notes collection I use org-publish to create a nice personal website out of org-roam files. I have an index file that programmatically lists posts in categories, with tags, or in alphabetical indices. I do this via macros that expand into dynamic blocks and run all dynamic blocks during export via a source block near the bottom of the page.
 It&#x27;s slow. Real slow. I do all the post link lookups using org-roam, so I assume that&#x27;s just sqlite db queries. Then I use very minimal org syntax to turn it into links.
 I realised recently that I could probably do the same thing via exported source code block results, since I only need all this stuff during export.
 Is there a noticeable performance difference between org-babel exporting the results of some Lisp code, and that same Lisp code being used via dynamic blocks?

                              <span>I want to rebind &#x27;q&#x27; (normal-state) in org-agenda. The actual keybind that is finally applied seems to be defined by evil-org-agenda minor mode (how do I tell?).
 I tried:
 (map!
 :mode org-agenda-mode
 :map general-override-mode-map
 :n
 &quot;q&quot; &#x27;org-agenda-exit)
 The idea being &quot;:mode org-agenda-mode&quot; will make sure that the keybind is set only in that mode and &quot;map general-override-mode-map&quot; should override any possible high priority keymap.
 This does not work.

                              <span>I have tried doing
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t)
 (setq-default tab-width 4)
 (defvaralias &#x27;c-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width)
 (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t)
 (defvaralias &#x27;ruby-indent-level &#x27;tab-width)
 (defvaralias &#x27;sgml-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width)
 But it doesn&#x27;t work. This leads to tabs just being composed of 4 spaces, not one tab. Similar to the neovim editor, I want tabs to be just tabs. One large block, instead of being packed with several tiny spaces. I need this for indentation. Relying on tabs to be just full of spaces is impossible for me. Can anyone help. I have tried several solutions, but they all are just solutions which means tabs will be filled with &#x27;x&#x27; no of spaces. not tabs with TABS. I am new to Emacs, and I have heard this whole tab business is not very straightforward. So please do explain if I got something wrong
 EDIT - I got the solution from this kind soul on stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6471803/making-emacs-tabs-behave-exactly-like-vims
 (eval-after-load &quot;cc-mode&quot; &#x27;(define-key c-mode-map (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;DEL&quot;) &#x27;backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function &#x27;backward-delete-char) 
 This treats tabs as one large tab. You can have the same control as neovim. It also deletes the entire tabs via the single backspace. I am not sure if this is gonna work with javascript. But I hope this post will help others
 This is all I have put in my init.el file related to tabs
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode t) (setq-default tab-width 4) (defvaralias &#x27;c-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width) (setq ruby-indent-tabs-mode t) (defvaralias &#x27;ruby-indent-level &#x27;tab-width) (defvaralias &#x27;sgml-basic-offset &#x27;tab-width) (eval-after-load &quot;cc-mode&quot; &#x27;(define-key c-mode-map (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;self-insert-command)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;DEL&quot;) &#x27;backward-delete-char) (setq c-backspace-function &#x27;backward-delete-char)

I&#x27;m guessing there are better, more up-to-date documents out there, but I just want to read this at the moment. I&#x27;m sure I can convert it manually, but just want to check that it isn&#x27;t listed as something odd in the existing set of Info pages.

                              <span>Hello.
 During upgrade to scala 3, a code involving reads/writes to json, raises a &quot;Ambiguous given instances&quot; error which I&#x27;m not sure how to solve.
 It only happens when trying to serialize a Seq of a type, not the type itself.
 Here&#x27;s a Scastie to demonstrate:

                              <span>Hi Everyone, I got a staff offer but my past experience is more on C# and Azure, the new team is full stack Scala and GCP. I’m nervous about the swift change, and really appreciate any advice and suggestions how to ramp up them quickly. Thanks!

                              <span>Me again! after removing some libraries, my project now depends on:
  
containers
 mtl
 transformers
 singletons
 singletons-base
 parsec
  
Nevertheless, since I&#x27;m using ghc-wasm-meta, I cannot really include the singletons-base package (since it depends on th-orphans and the WASM backend doesn&#x27;t support TH yet).
 I might be able to patch things up, if I can just expand the TH definitions in the singletons-base package, but I don&#x27;t really know how to do this without just forking the repo, running cabal build with -ddump-splices -ddump-to-file flags, and manually deleting the _XXXX identifiers.
 Is there a better way to do this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not new to emacs but I&#x27;ll confess I look under the hood much less than I think I should, so bear with me if I&#x27;m not giving enough details yet.
 I&#x27;m connecting to a remote machine via SSH and Tramp, and I can edit files normally. But when I try to stage a file, emacs just hangs until I press Ctrl+G. If I stage through the command line and try to commit, *Messages* displays &quot;condition-case: Wrong number of arguments: transient--emergency-exit, 1&quot; and nothing happens in Magit.
 How do I start debugging this one?

                              <span>Quick question, before I dive head first into tree sitter land.
 I have a 2400loc file which is super laggy
 Turning off font locking removes my performance issues, so I know it&#x27;s an issue of font locking
 Is switching to tree-sitter likely to fix my perf issues?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen some pretty and complex large code bases written in C++ for image manipulation and color space conversions and to the untrained eye they look like having a set of unrelated bunch of source code with same functionality spread between different files, but usually it makes sense due to the chosen of a complex architecture fitting to critical processing and low level access. It can take months to understand what its being done and the process usually feels like trying to take some random file reading it, trying to look its dependencies back and forth until you finally make some sense out of those. Could this process be eased if every file was accompanied by some org file? And could a master org file tell &quot;Hey this is how you should begin reading the source code&quot;

 Let&#x27;s say, will it be possible to do the same with another interpreter? Something like a Lua interpreter and build everything on top of it with pure Lua or a Java&#x27;s JVM and build something on top? Was this tried before?

                              <span>I have quite a few projects and meeting and i keep track of them by using columnview dynamic block to show them in the project (each meeting has a property which points to the project and :match searches for the property). Columview has an option to add Links (so i just need to click on it and see what has been discussed). But this link feature doesnt work if the item are in a different file. 
 So when capturing a meeting with org-capture i just created another property like:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]]
 which is essentially a link to itself, where %\1 is the Meeting Title and the org headline and add this Property to the columnview. That way i can click on it form a project and see what the meeting was about.
 Now the Problem: the headline might not be unique (e.g. weekly repeating meeting) and there for i thought it might be a better idea to use a custom_id for example. So i tried to use a capture template like this:
 * %^{Meeting}
 :PROPERTIES:
 :PROJECT:
 :ATTENDEE:
 :LINK: [[file:~/org/meetings.org::*%\1][%\1]
 :CUSTOM_ID: %-%(string-replace &quot; &quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;%\\1&quot;)
 :LINK2: [[id:%-%(replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\s&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;%\\1&quot;)][%\1]]
 :ID: %(org-id-new)
 :END:
 I try to replace the whitespace in the headline as this would be no valid ID. But that doesnt work it gets evaluated but the whitespaces are not replaced. i could reuse :ID: aswell but dont know how in a capture template. Ideas??

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have to locate lines in a text file, where an opening double quote is followed exclusively by a lowercase letter
 I have tried in my terminal and did a grep search grep &#x27;&quot;[a-z] my file.txt it worked fine.
 But in emacs, I have been trying with grep, rg, occur... I get text with uppercase letters... like &quot;Find or &quot;Cut... Since I have more than 2000 entries to possibly fix, I want to do it within emacs .
 How shall I proceed in emacs to have it work? Why isn&#x27;t it working like it should?
 thanks for your help

                              <span>So I have set a background transparency in gui emacs according to this guide https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TransparentEmacs . And everything seems fine except one annoying thing, which I at least can&#x27;t set or understand, is it possible to have a solid color on modeline in emacs when you have set background transparency? I want to use packages like https://github.com/dbordak/telephone-line or https://github.com/tarsius/moody . And they look ugly without solid color on modeline, is it possible to do this in emacs?

Inspired by @ZettelDistraction, I&#x27;ve developed my own Custom Note Critic GPT, which I&#x27;ll share if you are interested. He focuses more on the formatting of the note, and I&#x27;ve made mine a writing tutor, pointing out areas where I can be more concise and more engaging and explain my ideas with confidence and clarity.


@ZettelDistraction said,

  
I would like to see this. In the spirit of the Paris Olympics, we could have a &quot;GPT-off&quot; to compare GPT output, Zettel by Zettel.


Here ya go! There is no guarantee that once you see this, you won&#x27;t puke.

I&#x27;ll have to run the same note through both GPTs and compare the results. This could be a big project.</span>

                              <span>Greetings,
 I am trying to make use of the &quot;wuss&quot; secure websockets library, at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wuss. This adds TLS to the underlying websockets library.
 I can build and install the library fine with GHC 9.8.2, and the sample client at https://github.com/tfausak/wuss also builds fine. However, when I go to run it, it fails as follows:
 dyld[44192]: missing symbol called
 In this case, 44192 is just the PID. I tried using otool to see if there is a missing dynamic library, but I believe this shows that there is no missing library as such. Most likely, the &quot;missing symbol&quot; means that the library that is used, doesn&#x27;t have something that is called. However, the error doesn&#x27;t specify the issue there.
 otool -L ./dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-osx/ghc-9.8.2/wussTest-0.1.0.0/x/wussTest/build/wussTest/wussTest
 ./dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-osx/ghc-9.8.2/wussTest-0.1.0.0/x/wussTest/build/wussTest/wussTest:
 /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1345.100.2) /opt/local/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11) /opt/local/lib/libffi.8.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0) 
 Any thoughts on how to resolve?

                              <span>Dear Haskellers
 I&#x27;ve been struggling with a strictness/laziness issue in a recursive mini-language I&#x27;ve been trying to define. I&#x27;ll present a pruned version here to narrow the code to the focus of my issue. 
 I can encode my problem with 5 combinators:
 haskell data Recur t a &#x3D; Val a -- ^ A stored value | Hop t -- ^ A jump-to-binding statement | Seq [Recur t a] -- ^ A sequence of &#x27;Recur&#x27; statements | Opt [Recur t a] -- ^ A choice of &#x27;Recur&#x27; statements | Bnd t (Recur t a) (Recur t a) -- ^ An introduce-binding statement deriving Eq makeBaseFunctor &#x27;&#x27;Recur 
 Then I can define recursive sequences like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell type R &#x3D; Recur Text Int
 x12, x34 :: R x12 &#x3D; Seq [Val 1, Val 2] x34 &#x3D; Seq [Val 3, Val 4]
 n1, n2, n3 :: R n1 &#x3D; Opt [x12, x34] n2 &#x3D; Seq [n1, n1] n3 &#x3D; Bnd &quot;x&quot; n1 (Seq [Hop &quot;x&quot;, H…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for project ideas for a final assignment in a college course using a functional language. We primarily used Haskell, but we&#x27;re open to other functional languages if the project is interesting.
 The project should take around two weeks for two advanced software engineering students, so it should have some complexity (but not too much). Preferably it should use a monadic strategy to solve a problem.
 I&#x27;ve already built a compiler in a previous course, so I&#x27;d prefer not to go that route again. I was considering creating a SAT solver, but one of our teachers mentioned it involves a lot of state management, so I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s the best fit.
 Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Streamly is a concurrent stream and array library supporting a wide range of functionality.
 Important features in the new release include: (1) fast binary serialization to arrays with an option to serialize record field names; (2) the array type can now represent pinned as well unpinned memory, unifying the representations used by bytestring, text and vector; and (3) concurrency support for folds.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a project, and I&#x27;ve recently hit a devops-ish kind of issue: after getting ghc-wasm through nix flakes, I&#x27;m trying to compile the project by: wasm32-wasi-cabal build WASM --flags&#x3D;&quot;wasm&quot;, but I get errors building happy and th-orphans.
 happy error:

 Regarding the happy error, although there is no unlit executable in that folder, there is one called wasm32-wasi-unlit, so I believe some sort of symlink can solve this, but I have no idea on how to include this in the flakes.nix file.
 Regarding the th-orphans error, I&#x27;m totally clueless.
 P.D: don&#x27;t mind too much about stack in the flakes, it&#x27;s there because I wanted to make sure that the other executable compiles normally.

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding the &#x60;._&#x60; import so confusing and this is heavily used by the Scala community. My main issue is, given that you have multiple &#x60;._&#x60; imports it&#x27;s difficult to reason about the origin of the thing you&#x27;re using or what is available to be used.
 For those that have been using Scala for a long time, this improves over time and do you have this same feeling?

                              <span>ok right out of the game i&#x27;m using doom emacs, aside from the org plugins that comes with it i&#x27;m using org-auto-tangle (not the case for this file) and org-modern. now onto the issue.
 I have a very long list, with many subnested lists (think of it as a tree), and as of now it&#x27;s currently 6000 ish elements.
 before you say why such a big list it&#x27;s stuff I want to buy, it&#x27;s a way to autocontrol..
 whenever I C-c C-c on anything, that be a checkbox or a counting box (the [/], idk the proper name), it takes a lot, like a good two minutes at least.
 i tried to profiling, and it seems taht org-element--list-struct in memory section is the biggest one, with match-data in cpu, but the latter it&#x27;s only a 6%. I can post the full profiling if it can help, but from my (poor) understanding of the profiling reoprt, these two are what takes longer. is there a way i can improve the performance? or do I have to split it down into smaller lists? i have such giant single list because I like to have at the top two boxes that one is the percentage and the other one is the counting one. if there is a way to divide the list into the various categories, maybe with *s, while keeping an overall &quot;completion&quot; on the top, that would solve the issue.
 tl;dr i have a giant list. can i improve the performance? I just chronometered it, and it clocked it at around five minutes. or, if I break it down to more smaller lists, is there a way I can keep track of the overall progress?

 Release notes:
  
The change in major version from 2.x to 3.1 marks the dropping of support for versions of GHC before 8.4, deprecated in Stack 2.15.1.
  
Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.
 The init command initialises stack.yaml with a snapshot key rather than a resolver key.
 After installing GHC or another tool, Stack deletes the archive file which provided the tool.
 Remove hidden flag --skip-intermediate-deps, effectively deprecated since Stack 1…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I am struggling to find the relevant documentation to get emacs to work with debugpy remotely.
 I have an app locally in docker, debug server running inside the docker, exposing port for connection.
 It seems I need to set up an lsp-docker.yml file but I cannot find a single reference specific to debugpy (which is a relatively common debugger - it&#x27;s a ms product designed for vscode - I would change it to pdb but team project and not possible)
 Anyone has experience working with this?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I create a new Scala project placing the content below by following its doc here and here
 # project/plugins.sbt addSbtPlugin(&quot;org.scalameta&quot; % &quot;sbt-scalafmt&quot; % &quot;2.5.2&quot;) # .scalafmt.conf version &#x3D; &quot;3.8.3&quot; runner.dialect &#x3D; scala3 
 But when hovering over .scalafmt.conf, the vscode hints with the message below, though sbt package doesn&#x27;t throw any error.
 Invalid config: Default dialect is deprecated; use explicit: [sbt0137,sbt1,scala211,scala212,scala212source3,scala213,scala213source3,scala3,scala3future] Also see https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/docs/configuration.html#scala-dialects&quot; 
 What is the right way to configure scalafmt, allowing the vscode to format my code automatically?
 My environment
  
Scala: 3.4.0
 Java: 21.0.4
 sbt: 1.9.8
 vscode: 1.91.1
  
Thanks

                              <span>Hello folks, I am still continuing to work on my &#x60;elfeed&#x60; configuration working in Spacemacs. It is certainly coming along now :).
 One question I had was, how can I get the date to display on the search screen. There are a lot of images of the elfeed search screen that show the date listed. I have posted an image below. 
 Elfeed with date column
 However, when I run my elfeed search screen in Spacemacs, I don&#x27;t see the date listed.
 Elfeed without date column
 Is there a specific configuration variable that I need to change? I looked through the elfeed docs, but I did not find any references to this.

                              <span>So I have a pretty good working setup for completions, but there is one annoyance that I haven&#x27;t figured out how to change. I&#x27;m writing both python and rust, and my issue is that when I select a completion for a function name or class, it always puts opening and closing parenthesis after it, automatically. Meaning, I type:
 my_obj.beginning_of_metho
 and it (corfu) gives me the option:
 beginning_of_method
 I select it, and what it inserts is:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Which is right 80% of the time, and infuriating that 20% of the time that I needed to pass that bare function somewhere. Its more annoying with class names, it puts parens in when I&#x27;m just trying to make a type hint. 
 I&#x27;ve seen this behavior with rust-analyzer, jedi-language-server and pyright, so I don&#x27;t think its server specific, and I&#x27;ve seen it with lsp-mode and eglot so I don&#x27;t think its specific to those modes. I&#x27;m using corfu, but I haven&#x27;t figured out a switch in corfu to change this behavior.
 The ideal behavior in my opinion would be when I select the method name, it inserts just that:
 my_obj.beginning_of_method
 And then if I type an open paren
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(
 At that point it would insert the args with the closing paren.
 my_obj.beginning_of_method(argname1, argname2)
 Has anyone else figured out how to do this? I can&#x27;t be the only person annoyed by this behavior.

 When I try same with &#x60;git worktree add -f ../new-work-tree main&#x60; is it able to create directory and checkout just fine.
 Am I missing anything here? 
 Also side-note: I see these &quot;file missing&quot; errors also when using other modes. Wondering if there any variables I can set to make it default behavior everywhere. 
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I know this may be the wrong place to ask… but let’s give a try. I have some complex objects in my code, by complex I mean that they describe “actions” and they have an impact, may have preconditions, and may have incompatibilities. All these elements are maps from the same set of keys to to integer values. And these values may be 0, 1… or max-1, max (where max is maximum value) They are now described in my Scala code, but would like to give some SME, non programmers, the ability to modify them. I must say that the I find the Scala code reasonably easy to read, but probably will be error prone. From a usability perspective do you have any experience on what would work better? - Teach some Scala (case classes mostly) - Build a DSL - Provide a GUI
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone ! I am a backend engineer with experience in Java , spring boot applications with cloud experience of over 7 years . I am currently a senior backend engineer and got an offer for a lead software engineer where the company used Scala. Although the role and compensation is good I am thinking if it will be a wise move to Scala from Java in terms of future scope and opportunities. Can someone who have similar experience share some thoughts, it will be helpful 
 Note : I have seen this question in this group in the past but not in recent times so wanted to understand

                              <span>I tried solving https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5 in Haskell because it looked like a good problem to use the State monad.
 However, there was no need to use the State monad. Just mconcating endomorphisms s -&gt; s is the appropriate way to solve the problem https://stackoverflow.com/a/3411461.
 Can someone suggest a toy programming puzzle where you actually need to use the computation result a in the State monad s -&gt; (s, a)

I am finishing my processing of the third part on how to read the various genres of non-fiction.
It seems to me that this section should be retitled as &quot;Our basic view on the philosophy of XY (social science, history etc.)&quot; I can&#x27;t get anything out of the whole part.
Did you get something out of the third part?

 Some of the tabs are red some are don&#x27;t. What might be the problem here?

 I enjoyed this variant the most in neovim: https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-files.md

                              <span>I am relatively new to using &#x60;elfeed&#x60;. I used it years ago, then I forgot about it for a while, and recently came back.
 So I was wondering about the current best way to filter the posts by tags, so that I can focus on specific groups of posts instead of the entire stream. I was looking at Mike Zemansky&#x27;s approach to filter the posts using a hydra and a macro. It looks pretty good, and I was working towards that. However, I realized that this approach was 7 years old. 
 Hence, I was wondering if there are any better or improved ways to filter posts today, that were not referenced in Mike Zemansky&#x27;s post? I believe in his code, emacs looks for all unique tags in the total feed, defines shortcut or hydra keys, and finally creates a hydra that the user can use to search for those posts. So it seems simple and nice. 
 But as I said, I was not sure if there was a package to do this now, or do I have to write that code myself in my &#x60;.spacemacs&#x60; file. Any suggestions are welcome.

                              <span>I frequently use magit refs buffer to switch between branches. However, for a large repository that I am currently using, switching between branches or refreshing the magit refs buffer takes a minute or more on a modern macbook, and emacs gets hung up for a long time. The output after magit-toggle-verbose-refresh shows the largest time consuming operation
 magit-insert-tags 50.73 
 I tried to disable it with
 (remove-hook &#x27;magit-status-sections-hook &#x27;magit-insert-tags) 
 in init.el however I get a completely blank magit refs buffer after that, and plus I don&#x27;t want to disable it for all repositories. I also tried including
 ((magit-status-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter &#x27;magit-insert-tags))))) ((magit-refs-mode . ((eval . (magit-disable-section-inserter &#x27;magit-insert-tags))))) 
 in the .dir-locals.el file but that didn&#x27;t have any effect.
 I am wondering how I could disable magit-insert-tags while also displaying the branches. I am inclined towards repository specific rather than an init.el solution.

 I have this route with zio-http, but the page is returning a 500 with an error that doesn&#x27;t make sense: Validation failed for header &#x27;warning&#x27;
 How would you debug cases like this? 
 Typically, in java, I just add a breakpoint or at least add logs. I&#x27;m not sure how to do this in scala.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to move away from using bespoke query building logic in a Haskell service at work. My impression from surveying some of the popular options (Beam, Persistent, Opaleye...) is that while they have tools to pull schemas and synchronize with your database, they still require you to manually declare types corresponding to tables. 
 This Haskell service is however one of many accessing the database and the schema changes somewhat frequently, so manually keeping types in sync isn&#x27;t ideal. In the parts of our codebase that are written in TypeScript we use libraries like prisma and prisma-kysely to generate type definitions and the experience has been pretty good. 
 Is there anything like this in the Haskell space? My hope is that I wouldn&#x27;t need to manually edit type definitions if someone else at the company adds a table or changes a column somewhere in the DB.

 Granted most mentions are 7 years old...
 Should I just go ahead and download it from source, or are there better resources that do the same?
 I want nice integration. Ideally something that also interacts with Hoogle,

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell, enjoying developing a web app using Scotty, but I&#x27;m struggling to figure out how I can launch (background) async IO operations.
 For example, let&#x27;s say I have a handle function:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell longBackgroundIOStuff :: IO () ...
 handleSomething :: ActionM () handleSomething conn &#x3D; do my_param :: String  { longAsyncIOFunction(); res.redirect(&#x27;/&#x27;) }); 
 What would be the best way to accomplish this with Scotty? Thanks so much and sorry if this isn&#x27;t the best forum for these kinds of questions.

 I was wondering if it is possible to achieve the following:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class C t where type D t transform :: t -&gt; D t -&gt; [D t]
 funGeneric :: (C t) &#x3D;&gt; t -&gt; D t -&gt; [D t] funGeneric t initial &#x3D; _ {-# NOINLINE funGeneric #-}
 funSpecialized :: (C t, Int ~ D t) &#x3D;&gt; t -&gt; Int -&gt; [Int] funSpecialized t initial &#x3D; _
 instance C () where type D () &#x3D; Int transform _ i &#x3D; _
 {-# RULES &quot;specialize\Int&quot; forall x y. funGeneric x y &#x3D; funSpecialized x y #-} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and then, for instance:
  someFun :: Int -&gt; IO () someFun initial &#x3D; print $ funGeneric () initial 
 where I&#x27;d expect funGeneric to be re-written to funSpecialized The rule itself type-checks, but no matter what I try, it never fires due to:
  
&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Rule check &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 
 Rule check results: 
 Expression: funGeneric
 ($ctransform &#x60;cast&#x60;  :: (() -&gt; D () -&gt; [D ()]) ~R# C ()) () (initial &#x60;cast&#x60;  :: Int ~R# D ()) 
 Rule &quot;specialize\Int&quot;: arguments [4] do not match (1-indexing)

I can do a little of everything, I can code with SpringBoot, .NET, NodeJS or Django. Also React and Angular, and SQL databases. I already know Git too.
 If these skills are not enough I can still learn a lot by myself in my free time and catch up to your required skill set.
 If you are interested please send me a DM and let&#x27;s talk!

                              <span>Basically, I&#x27;ve stayed at my job for 6 years. In my country there were at some point max 3 - 4 companies using Scala, even not full time, and now it is even rarer. When I got my first interview for a international remote job I had about 1.5 years of Scala experience, but 4 years total experience. I went pretty far but didn&#x27;t get it because lack of experience. After that, I&#x27;ve had up to a dozen of these kinds of interviews, for a remote international team, but I never managed to get a job. Now finally I have found a new job but it is not a great project and not what I want.
 I am not the most enthusiastic person when it comes always being up to date and reading blogs and stuff and also for the past years, I have not been a person who got assigned to the more complex stuff in my company. Otherwise I have a pretty good basis for algorithms and coding challenges (although I failed the last one which was live coding using lots of Scala generics).
 Now, it seems to me that when recruiting for a remote team, especially for a senior position, the stands for a Scala developer are pretty high and the projects are not simple (relatively, like more distributed stuff).
 Does anyone have more insights how this compares to other languages. A lot of people that I know which I wold think were at my level as a developer or even sub, got remote jobs or jobs away from my country, and I am feeling stuck. I keep wondering if it would have been easier to find this kind of remote job if i stayed with C# or moved to Java, and not due to lack of opportunities in the Scala world....

For example, what is the performance impact of using a HTTP server in ZIO or Cats Effect instead of a plain Java one. It&#x27;s likely that Scala will be slower, that is the expected, but what I&#x27;m wondering is how slow.

                              <span>Hello.
 In Scala 2.13 we were using the TypeCase from Shapeless library to overcome type erasure in pattern matching. demonstration:
 private val &#x60;Seq[AlertEntity]&#x60; &#x3D; TypeCase[Seq[AlertEntity]] def onGetAlerts(arg: Any): Unit &#x3D; arg match { case &#x60;Seq[AlertEntity]&#x60;(alerts) &#x3D;&gt; () } 
 It was pretty convenient.
 Now upgrading to Scala 3 and checking if there a new canonical way to do it or if I should best stay with the current implementation.
 Saw TypeTest but wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it even for this simple example.

                              <span>I really like the indicators (specifically for headings) provided by org-margin, but it does not work with org-indent-mode. Is there a way to get these two to work together or to possibly do something similar to org-margin? Thanks.
 Update...
 I ended up just overriding the function org-margin-mode-on by removing the piece that threw the error. Not sure if this is a particularly good idea, but everything seems fine for now.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs to write Common Lisp code, and paredit doesn&#x27;t respect the syntax of read macros. So, for example, when I write #P or #C or any other dispatch read macro(like my lovely home-brew λ)and open parenthesis or double quotes, it will insert a space before inserting the pair, and I have to double back to erase it. It&#x27;s a really minor inconvenience, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s already a good solution to this problem or if anyone would be interested in improvement to paredit to correct this.
 You can just disable the behavior by adding to your .emacs, or whenever after paredit is loaded, 
 (defun paredit-space-for-delimiter-p (endp delimiter) nil) 
 But obviously this is a bit of a hack, and though I might try this out for now because I haven&#x27;t ever noticed the space-adding behavior to be useful, I might find I&#x27;ll miss it when it&#x27;s gone, and want a more syntax aware paredit. 
 I noticed there&#x27;s also a paredit-space-for-delimiter-predicates variable which you could use(or just use to disable the behavior in a less hacky way), but I would need to somehow query slime/swank to to robustly find out what the active read macros are(and I don&#x27;t know how to do that at the moment), as well as actually parse them(which is messy but doable).

                              <span>Hi folks,
 This is a package (early WIP, but usable for now) that enables formatting code in buffers via text properties.
 Long story short, it allows you to use any formatting function/command (like format-all-buffer or apheleia-format-buffer) to visually format the code in the buffer without actually modifying it. This is acheived by changing the text properties of the code with the spaces taken from the formatted code.
 This can be useful when working in a team and the codebase is poorly formatted, or when you don&#x27;t like the coding style and you want to view the code in the style you like.
 This can be seen as an ~equivalent~ to Resharper&#x27;s Virtual Formatter, which I just heard about when I started working on this package, but never used it actually.
 The current implementation requires treesit, so you will need Emacs 29+ with Tree Sitter support.

Announcing ghciwatch 1.0 by Rebecca Turner
At Mercury, we’ve developed a file-watching recompiler for Haskell projects called ghciwatch, which loads a GHCi session (a Haskell REPL) and instructs it to reload or add modules when files in your project change. Ghciwatch is very similar in design to Neil Mitchell’s excellent ghcid, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.

                              <span>I think I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t like that my habits are bunched together at the bottom of my agenda&#x27;s day view. Since I give my habits specific time slots during a day (I&#x27;m trying to be consistent of WHEN I do my habits), it would be nice to have them show up in relation to the current time.
 So I&#x27;m considering just removing the habit style and just setting them up as recurring scheduled TODOs but I want to confirm there aren&#x27;t other beneficial features to keeping it as a habit that I might not be aware of.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the completion feature of HLS provided by ghcide in VS code (I&#x27;m getting the same behavior on Mac and Windows).
 If I start typing, it gives me autocomplete options for all functions from any package it knows about -- awesome.
 But if I do
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B B.p 
 The B.p will give completion options for all functions starting with the letter p from any package, rather than only showing functions from Data.ByteString.
 Is this how it&#x27;s supposed to work? Are there any workarounds/customizations that will make it useable? There&#x27;s no point in autocomplete if I have to type out the whole function name to eliminate irrelevant functions.

I tried by downloading and installing the necessary eMacs packages from mobaxterm package list and then in the terminal when I’m trying to invoke eMacs or even emacs —version it say that I should use install emacs and is opening the moba text editor instead. And when I’m trying to install emacs (with the apt-get..command)…it says the package already exits. How can I rectify this issue ? Any help is highly appreciated

                              <span>I run many Elisp scripts on my org-node zettelkasten, which is 2000+ Org files. So I&#x27;ve had plenty of situations where I hit this old nugget:
  File mode specification error: (file-error Cannot open load file Too many open files debug) 
 Now I&#x27;m wondering why. I take care to kill the buffer on each iteration, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. But! If I let a function process only 500 files, then finish, then run it again for the next 500 and so on, it works out. Is the call stack holding on to all file descriptors opened by children?
 Anyway, a problem I cannot solve: I have no insight into the org-publish codebase, and recently I found that the count of files I want to publish has exceeded 1024. So now I cannot publish. Has anyone worked around that? My publish code.
 Root of the issue 
 On Linux you might think the issue is ulimit -n which defaults to 1024 (on Debian at least), but it turns out that even if you increase that then Emacs will just die. The base problem sounds like a compiled-in FD_SETSIZE value of 1024.
 Last year it seems someone tried to patch it: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00115.html but this person says it just made Emacs unresponsive.

                              <span>I have just had this idea and I think it&#x27;d be pretty useful. Knowing emacs, there&#x27;s a good change that either it&#x27;s already a package or a snippet exists online. 
 The idea is this. After entering a command, say M-x compile , I decide that I want it to be easily repeatable. So I then invoke a hypothetical M-x bind-last-command-to and it prompts for a key, say I now press . Now that compile command is bound to .
 I guess this is kind of like macros, but you bind it after the fact. And it is for a single command (even if it only worked for the last M-x compile it&#x27;d still be useful).
 Anyone know if it exists before I start trying to implement it myself? Thanks.

 Would that be an acceptable email to send there or is there maybe somewhere else I can put the message out to?

 i still don&#x27;t get it. how do i rewrite

                              <span>When I use M-. to go to definition (e.g. with ctags or eglot), often multiple options are shown if the declaration is a header file and source file, e.g.:
 src/foo.c 226:void foo(struct bar *bar) src/foo.h 1:void foo(struct bar *bar); 
 Are there any elisp magicians who know how to make it automatically prefer the C file in this case and jump to it directly without opening a buffer with the choices, and maybe also display a message &quot;both .c and .h files found; using the .c&quot; or similar?
 Or anyone could point me to the docs for this kind of thing, I&#x27;m a bit lost.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’m trying to get a C# environment up and running in Doom Emacs that can replace Rider. 
 I’ve managed to setup lsp-mode with Omnisharp and enabled decompilation, so I am able to use “go to definition” on .NET system types and external class libraries that are referred to in my project as nuget packages. 
 However if I have a class A in an external nuget package, and let’s say it refers to another type in another nuget package or a .NET system type, then I can’t go to definition from within class A to these types. 
 Rider allows me to do this, but Omnisharp can’t and this is one of the most useful features I use in Rider when debugging or trying to understand the code, and is the one thing that prevents me from going full Emacs for my C# development. 
 Is this a limitation in Omnisharp or can somebody share how to set this up, so I can decompile also referenced code from within a referenced nuget package?

                              <span>Basically, i&#x27;m working on moving the final pieces to org note taking. Many people recommend using git for notes. And on the surface this makes sense. It&#x27;s easy to use, automatic history and off device. But how do you deal with Personal Information in your Notes? Some of it might not be particularly interesting, but when you start using Due Dates and make Tasks on where to go, or whome you interact with, this could be different. Maybe you take a reminder to pick up some medication specific to a Illness you have.
 This might be even more of a problem if you use Org notes at work. Certainly most companies wouldn&#x27;t want you to commit customer data to github/lab.
 So, how do you deal with this? So far the obvious thing is to keep Notes that are work related in their own folder and either not sync that or keep it on our own hosted gitlab instance.
 With personal notes this is a tougher call. I want them on two PCs and my phone. My experience with Syncthing over three devices in the past has been less than stelar. Any other recommendations that work reliably so i can finally leave google keep and todoist behind? (And yes, i know it&#x27;s a bit ironic to care about personal information in org files in a git repo, when it&#x27;s currently all on google and todoist servers. But i want to improve things ;) )

                              <span>Hello,
 i am curious is there a way to get vb.net lsp support or in general support in Emacs? I wasn&#x27;t able to find any package whichs helps with that. 
 At work i have to use ALOT of Vb.net in the next weeks, i consider getting a Jetbrains Rider License, but i would prefer to use Emacs for that too.

                              <span>Hi,
A while ago I was reading the following post:
https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1574/just-started-already-lost-in-clutter-how-do-you-prevent-to-get-lost-in-so-many-notes-and-links/p1
From the feedback it is clear that you should split your note taking into different steps, by using some sort of workflow.
I&#x27;m not arguing against this, but I would like to know how this community spreads this over time. Like for example do you have daily or weekly reviews or something entirely different?
The reason I ask is because most of the time at work, like most of you :-), my day is pretty full and I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to organize my day and/or week to incorporate this workflow.
Thank you</span>

                              <span>Hello! I am retouching my section on the Zettelkasten (within my Zettelkasten), and I am having a hard time finding the source for the following claim, which is that Luhmann stopped using his Zettelkasten in his late years and instead focused on churning out manuscripts as fast as he could, perhaps given that he knew his life was coming to an end due to his illnesses. I cannot for the life of me find the source to this claim (which conveys my inability to properly execute the ZK method, as the claim, without its source, is noted down in one of my notes). But, anyway, I would really appreciate it if someone familiar with this could point me to a direction. I am also starting to believe that I made this up in my mind and convinced myself that I heard or read it somewhere, haha, even though I find it more probable that I heard about this in a podcast.
Thanks in advance!</span>

                              <span>Several months ago, ruff (An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust) introduced a Python LSP written in Rust. Check here. This is NOT the same as ruff-lsp, which is currently supported by Eglot and lsp-mode. Recently in version 0.5.3, they marked it as stable. Several of the other editors, including vscode, vim and helix, already support this LSP.
 Is anyone using this lsp with Eglot?

                              <span>Hello! I was wondering about a linter for the C programming language to ensure code follows the GNU guidelines for formatting. I figured emacs would be the best place to ask as it&#x27;s proximity to GNU, and also because that&#x27;s where I would want to use said linter anyways. Any help is greatly appreciated. 
 PS: Yes i know the format is ugly :)

                              <span>I have two Linux computers and a Windows computer. I use Emacs on all of them. 
 I&#x27;ve been looking for at handy way to share the Emacs configuration file between the computers. The basic step consists in letting the .emacs file on each computer load a common configuration file from a shared directory in Dropbox. With this in place, if I make a customization change on one computer, it is automatically available to the others.
 At least in theory.
 The challenge is that this sharing of a configuration file causes a lot of problems, because in many cases I want different configurations on the three computers. For example:
  
Path names to files will be different on my Linux and Windows computer.
 Font names are different.
 I have some project-specific configuration for a project that exists on one computer, but not on the others.
  
Also, if I install a new Emacs package on one computer, it will not get automatically installed on the others, and this may cause configuration problems.
 All of this can be solved by a very strict discipline about what goes where in various configuration files. But what I&#x27;d really like to know is this: Has any of you successfully created such a setup that actually works very well? If so, what insight can you share?

                              <span>I recently built Emacs from scratch and have been using Xwidgets. However, I can’t get edit mode or videos to work. 
 I have tried “e” to enable it, as well as M-x xwidget-webkit-edit-mode, as well as (add-hook ‘xwidget-webkit-mode ‘xwidget-webkit-edit-mode). Nothing seems to work; none of my key presses register and they seem to still execute commands. I thought it might be evil-mode, but disabling that doesn’t help (now everything echoes  is undefined). Does anyone know what the problem might be?
 As well, videos infinitely load. I know this is a known bug but it seemed as though it might have gotten fixed; I’m wondering if I’m missing some packages, I’m on alpine so a relatively minimal set of packages out of the box. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I am still using it. 
 But nowadays editors have line/word wrapping, including Emacs. My colleagues always use long lines when writing documents but I like using auto-fill-mode to keep lines short.
 I am thinking of giving up auto-fill-mode, but I can&#x27;t help pressing M-q time and time again :D

                              <span>Disclaimer: noob. I use org-mode and evil-mode extensively for notes and generally want text to wrapped at say 80 lines (easier readability, better use of screen-real estate when you&#x27;re using a tiling window manager or a terminal multiplexer). For those who do something similar, looking for some advice:
  
For wrapping text, can someone share a binding to toggle using text width of 80 and/off? Also useful to visually select text and set that to wrap at text width of 80 if you don&#x27;t want the all text wrapped in the file. For the latter, I often visually select the text and use a binding for fill-region-as-paragraph but this joins paragraphs separated by a line. 
 
This:
  
This is some notes blah blah blah
 
  
looks better than this
 - This is some notes blah blah blah 
 , right? I find myself needing to manually adjust for the former--how to have it be done automatically?
  
Do you have wrap at column 80 for everything? I feel like if you have text at several indents deep, those lines are too short because they still get wrapped at column 80. I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps wrapping at 80 characters starting from first non-space character to the last character on the line might be better, but I&#x27;m not sure of any editors that allow for this behavior by default and in this case it would be better to stick with consistent behavior vs. some custom solution that might not cover all edge cases.
  
Much appreciated.

 I&#x27;m trying to export org files to pdf using LaTeX&#x27;s beamer presentation. I&#x27;d like to use the async option to export my presentation but I get the error &#x60;Initializing asynchronous export process Process &#x27;org-export-process&#x27; exited abnormally&#x27; I read the [documentation](https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Export-Dispatcher.html) and says I should configure an init file and set the variable &#x60;org-export-async-init-file&#x27;. I don&#x27;t have much expirience with lisp-emacs and would appreciate your help.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m upgrading a project from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
 In the project we have many enums implemented using traits and case objects such as:
 sealed trait ClientRole object ClientRole extends EnumExtender[ClientRole] { case object User extends ClientRole case object Device extends ClientRole } 
 in the base class, EnumExtender, the values method is implemented using TypeTag in the following way:
 abstract class EnumExtender[ENUM_BASE: TypeTag : ClassTag] { ... private val typesMap &#x3D; allTypes final def values: List[ENUM_BASE] &#x3D; typesMap.values.toList private def allTypes &#x3D; { val tpe &#x3D; ru.typeOf[ENUM_BASE] val clazz &#x3D; tpe.typeSymbol.asClass val mirror &#x3D; runtimeMirror(classTag[ENUM_BASE].runtimeClass.getClassLoader) if (!clazz.isSealed || (!clazz.isTrait &amp;&amp; !clazz.isAbstract)) { throw new NoSuchElementException(...) } getSubclasses(clazz).filter(_.isModuleClass).map(t &#x3D;&gt; { val module &#x3D; mirror.staticModule(t.fullName) val i &#x3D; mirror.reflectModule(module).instance.asInstanceOf[ENUM_BASE] i.toString -&gt; i }).toMap } private def getSubclasses(symbol: Symbol): Seq[Symbol] &#x3D; { def children &#x3D; symbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses.flatMap(getSubclasses) symbol match { case s if s.isModuleClass &#x3D;&gt; Seq(s) case s if s.isClass &#x3D;&gt; Seq(s) ++ children } } } 
 TypeTag is no longer supported, so I&#x27;m looking for a way to achieve the same functionality, i.e. implementation for the values method.
 I can freely make changes to the EnumExtender base class, but I would like to avoid forcing changes on the actual enum subclasses.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I am looking for inspiration/ideas for my master&#x27;s thesis. I will have a year to do it and I am familiar with Haskell, FP and PL theory (with a little bit of language-based security). I don&#x27;t mind doing front-end GUI stuff either.
 I would love to pick your brains&#x27; imagination on something that would be interesting and useful to work on (implementation in Haskell of course :)). Or if you could point me to papers that contain ideas that can be explored in a Master&#x27;s thesis.

                              <span>Im working on a C project, and it would be pretty redundant to put #include 
 #include  .. in multiple codeblocks just so they can tangle to seperate files? is there a way to tangle 1 codeblock into 2 files like#+BEGIN_SRC c :tangle server.c client.c
 #include 
 #include 
 #include 
 #include 
 #include  
 #+END_SRC

                              <span>Hi
 I have many org mode files with lines beginning with dash.
 I want to export these to .html, but org mode process those lines as comments, and they are absent from the HTML exported file.
 I googled this but couldn&#x27;t find any working solution...
 Thanks for your help.
 org mode example :

                              <span>Hi
 I ran into a problem with configuration, caused by a malformed database path for a certain package. This causes a problem in emacsql, because it tries to treat the folder name as a file, but the error message is not descriptive at all.
 The more generic question is, how exactly should the user configuration be validated, i.e. I can of course add a check at the beginning of a function that uses it and it works fine, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the first one who thinks about it and there is likely a more elegant/standard way of doing it and maybe some guidelines?
 Current, not very informative error:
 ⛔ Error (use-package): org-roam/:init: EmacSQL had an unhandled condition: sqlitep, nil
 A primitive check:
 (if (file-directory-p org-roam-db-location) (error (format &quot;org-roam-db-location %S should be file, not folder &quot; org-roam-db-location)))

 How can I make the cursor aligned to texts also the same size after increasing the line space
 I increased the line-spacing by adding this in my init.el file 
 (setq-default line-spacing 5)

                              <span>Hello! I am running Spacemacs on Emacs 29.4 and Ubuntu 24.04. I installed elcord, but the thing in the title keeps happening.
 Two people have already reported issues on Windows on the repo, but the difference is that they were on the native build (which works perfectly fine for me w.r.t. elcord). I made an issue, but I suppose the owner abandoned the repo, so I am asking the community for some help. Is anyone in my situation?
 My suspicion is that the sock isn&#x27;t being created properly and as such elcord keeps trying to reconnect, which it will never success because the sock won&#x27;t be created.

                              <span>I am new to programming, Linux, and text editors like Neovim and Emacs. I was looking for tutorials to learn Emacs, but decided to learn Neovim first because it has easy-to-follow tutorials on YouTube. Although Emacs has the best beginner-friendly documentation, it is extensive and overwhelming. I need guidance on how to navigate these documents and where to start. I found a YouTuber with an Emacs playlist, but I have trouble understanding his content. 
 I only have an hour a day to learn, but I need to get my work done. Please advise on how to learn Org mode to start taking notes.

                              <span>I compiled emacs from source in Windows 10, WSL2, and it works fine. The &quot;Win&quot; key sees it, it runs fine.
 But when I C-w or M-w text from emacs, I can&#x27;t paste it into Windows apps. Content FROM Windows TO emacs works fine (C-c the text in Windows, C-y in emacs), just not from emacs to windows.
 Any thoughts on what I&#x27;ve done to screw this up, and/or how to fix it?
 If it&#x27;s working for you, do you have your compilation settings handy?

                              <span>Back in my neovim config, i had something set up similar to project-find-file. It would allow me to hit &quot;RET&quot; on the selected entry to open the file in the current window and &quot;C-RET&quot; to open it in a new window.
 Can this be done in emacs? I know that i could write a new function that makes the new window for me before running find-file, but that way i&#x27;d have two &quot;find-file&quot; functions depending on wether i want a new window or not, which is more mental overhead. I also couldn&#x27;t figure out what function is run when hitting Return on a find-file entry in the minibuffer.
 Any way to set up a bind/function that does what i&#x27;m looking for?

                              <span>Hi! persp-project bridges perspective mode to the built-in project.el library. The idea is to create a separate perspective when switching projects. A perspective is an independent workspace for Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS. This integration allows you to easily know which project you&#x27;re currently in, and focus on files that only belong to the current project when switching buffers.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package persp-projectile by Bozhidar Batsov with ChatGPT. I didn&#x27;t write a single line of code. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Natalie Weizenbaum for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I&#x27;ll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 Usually when I get a void function error I find something got out of sync in package updates, but I&#x27;ve gone through a complete rebuild (deleting all under elpa/, straight/ and transient/) to no avail--this is with emacs 29.4. I have another machine with emacs 29.3 and same dotfiles and the function works fine.
 Any suggestions on how to fix or where to look next? The function isn&#x27;t loaded--I get nothing when using C-h, f.

                              <span>Hi, I just started using emacs a few days ago and tried to get auto-completion to work for c/c++ so I decided to use company (because a guy on YT called Uncle Dave said it was cool). Unfortunately I get this very strange error in the minibuffer saying:
 Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: pos-bol
 And no completions show up.
 Auto-completion works with elisp (which comes by default I suppose), but not with c/c++.
 Also when I do M-x company-diag It says:
 Used backend: company-irony Major mode: c++-mode Prefix: &quot;inc&quot; Completions: none(error fetching) 
 (I tried to type #include)
 I am using Linux Mint with Emacs version 27.1. I also tried to use Emacs 29 but it doesn&#x27;t work there either, It gives an error saying:
 Irony server is broken! ... error status 127
 Did anyone have this issue and is it worth solving it or should I just use auto-complete?

                              <span>Hi there, i work in IT for 20 years, first as developer then as sysadmin.
 I worked in win, mac, gentoo, debian, redhat and for every circumstance i used different prebuilt ide like eclipse, visual studio and jetbrains, and vim with minimum knowledge for server management (copy, delete, regex replace... and i really hate counting!!!!)
 Now i use VSCode that is perfect for all my needs : project managements, rust developing, integrated terminal, docker and k8s integration.
 The only problem is that it becomes a ram eating machine and since i am non confident with websites like &quot;downloadmoreram.com&quot;, i would like to switch to another editor.
 The lack of an integrated terminal will not be a problem but a tree on the side is fundamental.
 Did you suggest me to start from scratch with the emacs manual or a prebuilt env like doom?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve posted about the ekg notetaking app for emacs before. After a brief hiatus, I&#x27;m back working on it, and I&#x27;m pretty excited about the latest changes.
 A few weeks ago I also put out a new version of llm with a new module, llm-prompt, which allows templatized prompts that have easy and effective context filling, something that hasn&#x27;t existed yet in any emacs module, AFAIK. The new version of ekg uses this new feature.
 Previously, the ekg-llm library would send the contents of the note, along with instructions to the LLM, which would then append to the note. Now, we also send the latest notes with the same tags, and similar notes, as part of the llm request context. This turns out to be a really important enhancement to the quality of the llm responses, and now using ekg is, IMHO, the best way to interact with LLMs. You can also edit the responses before you save them into a note (or just not save them at all). This is something else that can help improve the response quality. At times, the responses I&#x27;m getting are really magical - it really is what many people call a &quot;second brain&quot;, but for real. I find myself using it constantly as a default way to interact with LLMs.
 I give an intro to ekg and talk about using it as a &quot;second brain&quot; in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HC_h3syRKro
 The other improvements to this version of ekg are primarily Markdown improvements (using markdown instead of org-mode is kind of necessary if you are using it to talk to llms), fixing issues and getting inline links to work.

 Have you experimented with it? If so, what are your thoughts about it? In which things do you think Lean4 can not overpass Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss here as I have been trying to find a way to create context entries for custom servant combinators inside other combinators (I do authentication, then various authorisations, for example).
 There are various ways to frame this problem:
  
finding a way to &quot;compose&quot; serveWithContext
 passing data from one combinator to another
 and probably others
  
Does anyone know if it is actually possible as I&#x27;ve run into a bit of a wall.

 What do folks here consider the better way to manage packages?
 Here&#x27;s my package-related init mess accumulated over a decade or so:

                              <span>I recently installed emacs 29.1 on my Windows machine from this repo:
 https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/
 I started configuring it and the first thing I did is install evil-mode, so I can have nice Vim keybindings.
 I installed it with ELPA, and the installation seemed to work without any issues. The error shows up when I try to use the evil-mode package, with:
 M-x evil-mode
 , or with:
 (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1) 
 directly in my config file.
 This is the error Emacs prompts me:
 Warning (comp): evil-vars.el:561:25: Warning: the function &#x60;evil-delete-backward-word&#x27; is not known to be defined. 
 This seems to be an error from the evil package source code, as it is referring to the file evil-vars.el which can be found in the following directory:
 ~/.emacs.d/elpa/evil-20240…</span>

                              <span>I have no idea how difficult something like that would be to implement, and I am already more than grateful to the people that develop Emacs.
 Some fonts have alternative characters behind character variants (cv), stylistic sets (ss), or other (onum, zero), and it would be very nice not to have to use an external tool to modify the fonts by hand to use them.
 It is almost a requirement to use certain fonts: their g and r are just weird, but FiraCode with the default @ and &amp; is unusable :P
 It is supported in LaTeX (maybe only LuaLaTeX&#x27;s fontspec?), and by the enemy...

                              <span>Hello guys! I&#x27;m new to Emacs, came from VSCode + Vim.
 I&#x27;m working with C#, TypeScript (nodejs, react, etc), Python.
 It seems that TypeScript support is enabled gracefully with js and lsp module in init.el
 But C#... I can&#x27;t understand. Anyone been able to enable it?
 EDIT: for people coming here in the future: (csharp +lsp) in init.el will enable lsp auto start in csharp files. BUT you need a language server. First time opening .cs file do M-x lsp, it will suggest you to install language server. Roslyn (csharp-roslyn) did NOT work for me, so I installed omnisharp. It worked :D

                              <span>Hi all. I’m just starting with Typelevel stack and I also have only a little bit of experience with JVM ecosystem. Is there any consensus in community how to tackle problem of auth? I found some abandoned JWT libs, and the ones that are maintained are fairly unpopular. I guess this is the problem when you want to use well known and battle tested solution so using some Java libs seems like a no brainer. On the other hand using Java libs sacrifices a little bit of pure FP approach. What are you using on production with Typelevel stack to implement auth these days?

                              <span>Hello,
 I wish to sort directories before files, within the Completions buffer. This buffer is shown when executing C-x C-f TAB TAB, and should be done within a directory that contains directories and folders.
 The ls command has the option --group-directories-first, which is the behaviour I would like to achieve within the Completions buffer.
 Any insight is appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m encountering a peculiar issue with cursor behavior in Emacs, and I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me resolve it:
  
When the cursor is on Hebrew text, it becomes completely invisible.
 This only occurs with the cursor type set to &#x27;bar&#x27;.
 The &#x27;box&#x27; cursor type works without issues.
 There&#x27;s a similar, but slightly different issue with Arabic text.
  
I use Emacs 29.3 for Mac. Changing font and bidi settings haven&#x27;t solved the issue. Now I have no clue where to look for solution 
 Here is a short video to illustrate the problem.

                              <span>So i asked chatGPT
 &quot;doom eamcs recent files when i change dir of my file i want recent file to remove the old location entry&quot;
 chatGPT gave me the code
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ;; Function to remove old file path from recentf list (defun remove-recentf-entry-if-moved (oldpath newpath) &quot;Remove OLD-PATH from recentf-list if file is moved to NEWPATH.&quot; (recentf-edit-list) (setq recentf-list (cl-delete-if (lambda (path) (string-equal path oldpath)) recentf-list)) (recentf-save-list))
 ;; Hook the function to after-save-hook to update recentf list after saving a file (add-hook &#x27;after-save-hook (lambda () (let ((buffer-file-name (buffer-file-name))) (when buffer-file-name (remove-recentf-entry-if-moved buffer-file-name (file-truename buffer-file-name))))))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 adding this code to me config file gave me the following unneeded behaviour
  
whenever i try to quit recentf-edit-list opens
 whenever i save a file the saved file is removed from recent file
  
I didn&#x27;t want that so i just removed the code ran doom/reload yet the issue remained. The config file is clearly devoid of the code provided to me by chatGPT .
 After that failed i ran doom sync and then doom/reload still no change.
 I thought f#ck it and just reverted back to my previous commit and the issue still remains.
 Now i dont know what to do anymore.
 Please help as i just started getting into emacs 3 days ago and not good enough yet to deal with this myself.
 This is the value of my after-save-hook
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (diff-hl-update +emacs-lisp-non-package-mode flycheck-handle-save t ws-butler-after-save) Original value was nil Local in buffer config.el; global value is (doom-modeline-update-vcs doom-modeline-update-buffer-file-name #f(compiled-function () #) +evil-display-vimlike-save-message-h doom-auto-revert-buffers-h doom-guess-mode-h)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ANY HELP IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED

                              <span>I am starting the handmade hero series and he is using Emacs. For the intro to C series I was using Visual Studio 19. But Emacs having that command line type aesthetic intrigued me and I thought I would try it. So in the handmade project, Casey says something to the tune of he has setup a .Emacs file in the misc folder in the main handmade directory.
 What I can&#x27;t wrap my head around is how is he accessing those custom settings he setup for Emacs from any directory? Also how does Emacs know to use those settings? Also how to do all this?
 I&#x27;m sorry if you can&#x27;t understand what I am asking because even I don&#x27;t understand what I am missing.

I mean, I have a ultra wide monitor and lots of blank space it would really make more sense to see files across width rather than height

                              <span>Is there a way to copy something to clipboard directly from an org file that has images so that it can be pasted in a browser ?
 Im using doom and it has +org/export-to-clipboard-as-rich-text almost does this but when pasting into a browser ( such as a jira comment and confluence) the image doesn&#x27;t get pasted.
 I&#x27;ve also tried ox-clip and the solution described here : https://speechcode.com/blog/org-to-clipboard
 I&#x27;m using doom emacs 29.4 on Mac if that is necessary info.

                              <span>I appreciate all the dev work that&#x27;s gone into making HLS possible. It&#x27;s capabilities are way beyond what I experienced back when I was last writing Haskell and has made it so much easier to quickly look up documentation and get autocomplete without having to scroll through hackage documentation for all of the functions and types that I forget.
 However, my experience using it with neovim has been less than stellar. I seem to have nothing but issues with it, and I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a neovim problem or an HLS problem. I&#x27;m using the haskell-tools.nvim plugin with the standard nvim-cmp and lspconfig plugins. Most other language servers work reasonably well, but this one seems particularly finicky and I can&#x27;t figure out why.
 I&#x27;m currently having an issue where if I type anything for about 4-6 seconds after opening the first haskell file in the editor (while the language server is starting) it causes HLS to completely hang and become unresponsive. I&#x27;m also having issues with nvim-cmp screaming at me about misplaced dollar signs in snippets (I&#x27;m assuming because the haskell suggestions contain things like $ and $!).
 I decided to temporarily install vscode to see if that would do it. Everything worked completely flawlessly out of the box, absolutely no issues. The problem is, I would really rather not use vscode if I don&#x27;t absolutely have to.
 Has anyone been able to get a working config for haskell in neovim that plays nice? I&#x27;m thinking of maybe scrapping haskell-tools and configuring things directly to see if that helps, otherwise I&#x27;ve spent so much time fiddling with the editor that I may have to leave it and come back later when things improve.

A decade ago, I didn&#x27;t like the book too much because it seemed to be just another reading formula (similar to SQ3) that doesn&#x27;t get applied by the very people recommending them (e.g. my professors). This judgement still holds true to some extent. But perhaps, I am failing again a principle that I myself recommend adhering to, when you learn something: Shuhari
But there is a very specific obstacle in entering the Shu-stage that is encapsulated by this quote (rough translation):

                              <span>Hello, I have recently started learning Haskell and I am finding it incredibly interesting. This coming year, I will have to complete a programming project as part of my qualification as a student. I have taken to the idea of using Haskell for this task, but I have gotten stuck on any ideas for the project. I&#x27;m aware of the nature of Haskell and how it&#x27;s used in production, but am still stuck for ideas. Could anyone give me any project ideas? What have you personally developed in Haskell? What other Haskell projects do you use/find interesting? What aspects of Haskell do you find interesting to work with yourself? What sort of projects should I avoid?
 I am sorry if you have seen these types of posts frequently, but I could not find anything that was particularly useful to me. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>So my understanding of how API calls work in Haskell is something like this — The API request data that comes over the network is just a string(correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) and it gets converted into haskell record types by Aeson, that we can use in our applications.
 Now, Aeson uses instance declarations like below to convert the data to the record types.
 instance FromJSON MyType where parseJSON &#x3D; ... 
 I can see from hoogle that the type of parseJSON is parseJSON :: Value -&gt; Parser a, so the string that came over the network seems to have already been converted into a Value type.
 My question is how does the string type gets converted into Value type and where? If I want to do some transformation or validation on this string value, how can I go about it?

                              <span>Hello! I’ve started work on a QML library for Haskell!
 I had this idea of a kind of MVVC interface for a UI library in Haskell. A very very terribly written alpha is now here:
 https://github.com/yobson/qml-hs
 Is definitely isn’t fully implemented, and probably has memory leaks
 But it would be great if I could get feedback on the interface. There are no docs, so you will find the interface in the example (test/Main.hs)

                              <span>What is effect? I asked ChatGPT and it gave me various answers:
  
Effect types are any types of kind Type -&gt; Type.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -&gt; Type that have an instance of Functor.
 Effect types are types of kind Type -&gt; Type that have an instance of Applicative.
  
Sometimes it insists that a computation f a (where f is a functor) does not have an effect, only a context. To have a computational effect, there must be function application involved, so it uses terms like functorial context, applicative effect and monadic effect. However, it confuses me because the functor (-&gt;) a represents function application, as with State s and Reader r.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been playing a bit with the ideas from the trees that grow paper, and I&#x27;ve stumbled into something I don&#x27;t quite get.
 Consider the following silly existential:
 type family SomeX (tag :: Type ) (x :: Type) :: Type data Some tag x where Some :: SomeX tag x -&gt; x -&gt; Some tag () 
 If we let:
 -- Proof carries a prof for &#x60;psi a&#x60; data Proof (psi :: k -&gt; Constraint) (a :: k) where P :: psi a &#x3D;&gt; Proof psi a 
 Then we can &quot;inject&quot; constraints by:
 data Foo type instance SomeX Foo x &#x3D; (Proof Show x) 
 But, if I try to make a pattern, it throws a compilation error:
 -- Doesn&#x27;t work &#x27;x&#x27; does not unify with &#x27;x1&#x27; pattern SomeFoo :: (Show x) &#x3D;&gt; x -&gt; Some Foo () pattern SomeFoo x &#x3D; Some P x 
 I thought that this unidirectional pattern is supposed to work as an ordinary (possibly smart) constructor. If i &quot;downgrade&quot; it to an ordinary function, it compiles as expected:
 someFoo :: (Show x) &#x3D;&gt; x -&gt; Some Foo () someFoo x &#x3D; Some P x

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve generally been happy with treesitter&#x27;s cpp indentation, but there is a situation i run into often where I can&#x27;t get it to behave the way I want it to:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; FrontendServer::FrontendServer(int port, std::shared_ptr state_updater, bool replay_mode) : m_http_port(port), m_exit(false), m_thread(nullptr), m_state_updater(state_updater), m_replay_mode(replay_mode), m_jsonrpc_handler(state_updater) { // it wants to put things here }
 FrontendServer::FrontendServer(int port, std::shared_ptr state_updater, bool replay_mode) : m_http_port(port), m_exit(false), m_thread(nullptr), m_state_updater(state_updater), m_replay_mode(replay_mode), m_jsonrpc_handler(state_updater) { // but i want it to do this instead } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 any thoughts on how to achieve this? my current indentation setup:

                              <span>If you&#x27;re interested in using Hugo for a static blog, and want to post from Org-mode I&#x27;ve just uploaded a blog post you&#x27;ll probably find useful.
 For folks who are already using ox-hugo, it includes code for creating two new org links so that you can insert ref and relref shortcode links using the standard C-c C-l and navigating to the file so that you don&#x27;t make typos.

                              <span>Hello I am trying to write my emacs config from scratch. It is going well so far i have been able to set the font and the sizes of org mode headers. But I feel like font size proportion to each other is not pleasing like default font size, the headers font size, the tabs titles and the status line. I want to know if you have a method or a plug-in to harmonize all proportions maybe even introduce a golden ratio to make everything pleasing to the eye. Thank you.

 Im using doom and it has +org/export-to-clipboard-as-rich-text almost does this but when pasting into a browser ( such as a jira comment and confluence) the image doesn&#x27;t get pasted.
 I&#x27;ve also tried ox-clip and the solution described here : https://speechcode.com/blog/org-to-clipboard 
 I&#x27;m using doom emacs 29.4 on Mac if that is necessary info.

                              <span>I am using doom-shades-of-purple theme, which visually indicates source blocks in org-mode with a left bracket on the left side.
 render src-block
 However, when I switch to fullscreen mode, the left bracket moves along with the stretched window edge, losing its visual representation of the block.
 left bracket stretched
 How can I prevent the bracket from stretching along with the window edges, leave it to original place when maximize the window?

                              <span>I am trying to use completing-read inside a function, but it gives errors. I have the following code that works fine.
 (setq first-alist &#x27;((one . two) (three . four) (five . six))) (completing-read &quot;Prompt: &quot; (lambda (input predicate action) (if (eq action &#x27;metadata) &#x60;(metadata (annotation-function . (lambda (str) (concat &quot; : &quot; (cdr (assoc str first-alist)))))) (complete-with-action action (mapcar &#x27;car first-alist) input predicate)))) 
 If I put that completing-read function in another function to which I pass an alist, it gives an error which says (void-variable some-alist). Is completing-read not supposed to be used in functions? If it is, then what changes can I make to use it correctly. Thanks.
 (setq second-alist &#x27;((a . b) (c . d) (e . f))) (defun blahblah (some-alist) (completing-read &quot;Prompt: &quot; (lambda (input predicate action) (if (eq action &#x27;metadata) &#x60;(metadata (annotation-function .

                              <span>In the trend of recent posts on this sub I want to where the myth about setting the value of gc-cons-threshold high to improve performance came from. (I feel fairly confident in calling the idea that this improves performance a myth given that Emacs maintainers have frowned upon this practice on this sub)
 Also, are there any other common emacs myths that still go around that should be debunked? I think the idea that using tool-bar-mode or menu-bar-mode hampers your learning of the keyboard shortcuts is unfair and fewer &quot;Intro to Emacs&quot; guides should ask newcomers to turn them off.

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the new cognitive-complexity package, it is basically a port of codemetrics (based on tree-sitter) to the built-in treesit in Emacs 29+.
 https://github.com/abougouffa/cognitive-complexity
 The package implements the Cognitive Complexity metric for code, allowing it to calculate a score that describes the understandability of a piece of code.
 It is basically an implementation of Cognitive Complexity - A new way of measuring understandability.
 The original codemetrics package is based on the tree-sitter library, I forked it to port it to treesit so it can be used with Emacs 29+. I tried also to simplify the fork by removing some dependencies like dash and s.
 Looking forward for your feedback!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to open erc with M-x &quot;erc&quot;. I give it the default options and get the following error: Wrong type argument: stringp, (&quot;name&quot;)
 The function definition of erc is: 
 (cl-defun erc (&amp;key (server (erc-compute-server)) (port (erc-compute-port)) (nick (erc-compute-nick)) (user (erc-compute-user)) password (full-name (erc-compute-full-name)) id) 
 erc-compute-user above has red underlining with the error message &quot;You should depend on (emacs &quot;29.1&quot;) if you need &#x60;erc-compute-user&#x27;. I am using Doom Emacs with emacs version 29.3. Do I need to downgrade to get erc working, or is there some other solution? I haven&#x27;t found anyone else with this issue.

                              <span>I have this weird, mildly annoying problem. 
 Whenever I star Emacs and open any org-file with #+startup: overview for the first time, I can&#x27;t expand any headings. And I can&#x27;t figure out why. Executing normal-mode or org-mode with the same buffer has no effect. I have to close it and re-open it again. 
 I&#x27;m using Doom, but I rolled my own module, I&#x27;m not using the &quot;official&quot; Org module. Maybe this is an issue with straight.el? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m trying to manually call the commands - org-fold-reveal, org-cycle, and even org-reload (that reloads all of org.el Lisp files) etc. Nothing&#x27;s working.
 Does anyone else have the same problem? Can anyone give any suggestions how to troubleshoot this?

 I would like to run a function that goes through the whole file and creates a new table with:
  
A column of Table Names
 A column of the net difference of highest number and lowest number
  
How would I approach this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to start Emacs with a default window layout that sticks, and I got lost in the weeds of trying different packages recommended by several articles:
 https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager
 https://karthinks.com/software/emacs-window-management-almanac/
 I&#x27;d like the layout to look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/5NS7Es4
 But I&#x27;m completely lost.
 I understand that I need to set dedicated windows, but I am unable to figure out how Treemacs fits into that.
 If someone could help with the basic layout, I can probably figure out the dedicated buffers/windows configuration. Please help!
 Edited to add: After reading Micky Peterson&#x27;s guide &quot;Demystifying Emacs&#x27; Window Manager&quot; I think I understand the display-buffer-alist better now. I also tried saving a layout to .emacs.desktop and I&#x27;m reading through that, too. I think what is causing issues for me is the Treemacs sidebar window is special and doesn&#x27;t use a window. This is definitely a big ol&#x27; can of worms!

                              <span>Hi, my emacs hangs a lot more often for a few days. I do not exclude an error from my part (config). Is there a kind of logger to monitor everything I do with emacs and what emacs does so that I can see what it was doing or trying to do as it hung? I know the debug-on-error function, but here, nothing comes out .. it hangs but does not report any error.
 Sometimes it hangs when creating a new roam note (org-roam-node-find) or when I try to insert an org-roam link ...
 Any tip is welcome, thanks

                              <span>lately I had to uninstall Haskell from one of my systems and run into following problem:
 one of the challanges were, that this was a &quot;old&quot; system which had dealt with multiple eras of haskell stuff:
  
I didn&#x27;t know with which tool I had installed specific parts of the Haskell tool chain (Haskell-plattform, Chocolatte, ghcup, ... etc)
  
So how it went:
  
uninstallation of stack went smooth
 uninstallation of ghcup went smooth
 uninstallation of chocolatte went smooth
  
remark: I allso purged the env-variables of stack/ghcup/chocolatte
  
I&#x27;m not sure how I get rid of cabal/ghc(i) whenn using cabal --version in terminal the output is:cabal --versioncabal-install version 3.4.0.0 compiled using version 3.4.0.0 of the Cabal library
  
when using ghc --version in terminal the output is:
 ghc --version //ghci --version has the same output The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.7 
 using where.exe in power shell yields:
 where.exe ghci C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghci.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghci.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghci.exe where.exe ghc C:\tools\ghc-8.10.7\bin\ghc.exe C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ghc.exe C:\tools\ghc-9.2.1\bin\ghc.exe where.exe cabal C:\Users\ -censored- \AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin\cabal.exe 
 So:
 would it be sufficient to just simply purge those folders?

 Was it removed altogether ? Or is it available somewhere on the website and I am unable to see it.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been a pure Scala engineer for around 6 years now. The stack I&#x27;ve been working with was the typelevel with tagless final so 90% of our code was in the functional style. I got an offer from one of my previous employers for a Senior Java role and as usual they are using the Java Spring enterprise stack. 
 I&#x27;m considering the switch because of the better work-life balance, increased pay and more remote friendly. But what&#x27;s making me doubt is Java. I haven&#x27;t used Java (or any OOP language) in an production setting before and mainly throughout my career only used functional languages. Has anyone done a similar shift? Like moving from purely functional scala to Java EE style? And if so how was the adjustment? 
 I did a quick read through some Spring code bases and it just seems like most of the work is just using the spring annotations correctly, which I don&#x27;t really like since it&#x27;s seems like doing &quot;config&quot; instead of actual coding.
 So anyone with any experience on making a similar switch and how that went?

One thing I keep finding interesting with technologies is that humans tend to loose there individual selves and always want to recreate what others do, exactly, without tailoring tools for themselves. This thought could be a bit conceited, therefore I have to add that I&#x27;m a bit like that too.
Enough of shit-talking, I created this discussion to present my workflow.
A bit of context:
My current zettelkasten is in fact an evolution of a blog I started ten years ago. Even with my efforts to save this blog over time (manual backup, git) I think I lost a few things.
Then I started to want things simpler, markdown it is then. Static site generators (Hugo, Pelican, Jekyll).
During the pandemic I started engaging cross-thought with my father about music. The game was to listening to a re…</span>

                              <span>Greetings, I&#x27;m working on my computer science master&#x27;s thesis and I&#x27;m having trouble finding open-source standalone tools or Intellij/VS code plugins that would provide me with code quality metrics through static analysis on package, class, and/or method levels. Most of what I&#x27;ve found were refactoring or lining tools, and a few paid tools/services that would give me somewhat useful metrics. 
 I reckon I could cobble something together that I could use but it would be a significant time investment. So, I figured I could ask the Scala community for recommendations before I start doing it myself. Any suggestions?
 P.S. The list of metrics that I&#x27;m interested in isn&#x27;t that strict, but generally, it should be at least one of these metric sets: Maintainability Index, Halstead metrics, QMOOD metrics, MOOD metrics, and a few others.
 P.P.S. &quot;MetricsTree&quot; would be an ideal tool if it weren&#x27;t capable of handling only Java source code. I thought about compiling scala code and then decompiling class files into Java source code but that can skew the metrics too much.

                              <span>The other day, while still struggling to learn how mu4e works, I have noticed execute-extended-command suggest a faster way to get a command: for mu4e-update-index it suggested using mu-u-i.
 As I&#x27;m using Ivy, I thought, and somehow expected, to be able to achieve the same result. So I tried mu u i. Ivy suggested many mu4e commands, but mu4e-update-index was not near the top.
 As I&#x27;ve learned since, completion-styles, set to (basic partial-completion emacs22), explains how mu-u-i matches.
 Ivy uses its own &quot;completion styles&quot; that are different from the default ones. The default is ivy--regex-plus.
 Now, it&#x27;s not like Ivy is not matching the command, but it&#x27;s definitely not in the top results. Thus, using it requires more keys.
 Question: Is it possible to make Ivy matcher work closer to partial-completion or initials completion styles?

                              <span>In the thread &quot;Emacs too slow&quot;, there are lots of people saying that Emacs is always slow on MS Windows. There are some people saying that Emacs is always slow in general regardless of the OS.
 Now, Emacs is never going to be as fast as simpler editors. However, most of the time you shouldn&#x27;t be able to notice any slowness. All this suggests to me that lots of people are doing things sub-optimally. I have used Emacs for more a very long time. Here I&#x27;ll give some advice on speed. I haven&#x27;t deliberately optimized my Emacs setup for speed, but I have avoided things that make it slow.
 Firstly, there are some things that you can&#x27;t really change....
  
The speed of external programs like Git.
  
People often say that Git related packages are slow on Windows. This is true because Git is slow on …</span>

So when ever I start Emacs, my PC fan goes into a frenzy and I am unable to do anything on my computer. I have reinstalled Emacs a couple of times to no avail. The program that causing all this is emacs-wayland on my wayland session and emacs-gtk on my x11 session. Here is what I am getting when I run ps aux: /usr/bin/emacs -no-comp-spawn -Q --batch --eval (setq w32-disable-abort-dialog t) -1 /tmp/emacs-async-comp-org.el. Kindly help me solve this problem.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I work as a sysadmin and it is a common occurrence that I have to execute a command on a number of hosts (or a number of files) simultanously. What I currently do is have several buffers open at once and then switch to each buffer, make my change, go to the next buffer -- which, you can guess, is very tedious.
 After searching for a bit, I found the wonderful BROADCAST-MODE which allows you to do this for visible buffers. And indeed, it works just fine for regular text buffers. However, I was saddened to find out it doesn&#x27;t seem to work with VTERM, my terminal emulator of choice within emacs.
 Is there another mode I have failed to find? Is there a configuration settings I forgot to tweak? I&#x27;d love to hear your suggestions.
 Have a good day, fellows :)

                              <span>I am making this post for anyone else who might get stuck and need some help.
 I cloned the Emacs and Tree-sitter repos and decided to build the latest version of each on Fedora 37. While attempting to compile Emacs, I ran into several very frustrating build issues.
 My first issue was that while running ./configure --with-tree-sitter --with-native-compilation I kept getting an error saying that tree-sitter could not be found. The version that was available from dnf was too old, so I decided to clone the tree-sitter repo and compile it myself. In spite of tree-sitter building without issue, it was still failing to register with the Emacs configure script.
 The solution ended up being to first runldconfig after tree-sitter is done compiling:
 sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
 Then, to ensure that the emacs configure script finds it, export the path:
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH&#x3D;/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
 Then you can runmake &amp;&amp; sudo make installand everything should work.

                              <span>Working with my Zettelkasten constantly evolves, as my needs change over time. It seems to be an endless journey to improve my personal knowledge management system. By chance, I discovered &quot;Wardley Mapping&quot; by Simon Wardley [1]. It&#x27;s a method for understanding how to develop your strategies. My first idea to learn more about this visual tool was to apply it to my Zettelkasten strategy.
Let&#x27;s take a closer look. A Wardley map allows us to visualize the **Evolution **of business components over time. It starts from the unstable beginnings to more stable, standardized components. These components fall into four stages: genesis, custom, product, and commodity.
First: Genesis components are novel and new. Second: Custom components exist for a specific use case with some proof of value. Third: P…</span>

                              <span>Developing a Wardley Map for using a Zettelkasten in my personal knowledge management involves outlining several components to understand and strategize my approach effectively:
Purpose: Efficiently manage and leverage personal knowledge for continuous learning and productivity.
Scope: Digital note-taking, linking ideas, research support, excluding team collaboration.
User: Primarily self.
User Needs: Quick note capture, efficient organization with tagging and linking, easy retrieval.
Value Chain: From user to Zettelkasten.
Wardley Map: Helps to visualize the different components and their current state in the evolution, guiding where to focus efforts to improve my personal knowledge management system.
And here is my story: I started my changes to improve my personal knowledge management system by moving from OneNote to Obsidian two years ago (1). The major change was my first contact with the Zettelkasten framework (2). It was hard for me to change my personal organization from thinking in &quot;folders&quot; to &quot;tagging&quot; (3). My current challenge is to use analytical reading to improve my notes (4).
What will the next steps be? What are your recommendations?

                              <span>Hi everyone! Struggled as to what category to put this under - I guess it pertains to workflow, writing and the zettelkasten method more broadly...
I&#x27;m a PhD candidate and (inconsistently) use techniques shared here to organise my notes and ideas. It&#x27;s been a slow burn for me, but more and more I&#x27;m seeing the potential benefits of the zettelkasten approach. But I had a question about dealing with the messiness of writing over the long term alongside note-taking in the zettelkasten.
I&#x27;ll try and give a specific example. I&#x27;m currently working on one chapter of my thesis. I&#x27;m going through a literature note for something that I read for this chapter, and I&#x27;m seeing ideas that could be worthy to turn into their own seperate notes/zettels, and I could see potential use for them in a specific ch…</span>

Lately, I&#x27;ve been making notes on thinking skills, reading for knowledge, and organic idea development. Some of my notes have more developed ideas than others—the value of a note is directly related to the time and attention I give it. When I refactored my note on Samu Practic…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out a nice way to express arrays of composite values, like (a, b, c). For a variety of reasons I want to represent this with a composite of simple arrays, so for example an array of (a, b, c) would actually be structured as (array a, array b, array c). This is nice because zip- and unzip- like operations essentially become free. As I understand it, Data.Vector.Unboxed does something like this, although I don&#x27;t get quite how it works. For this particular application Data.Vector.Unboxed is not suitable however as I&#x27;m making this array library specifically for an FFI which requires pinned memory.
 What I want to do is define composite types in a simliar way to how a value level list might be,
 comp &#x3D; a:b:c:[] 
 so that it can be transformed by applying a type level function to each element
 map f (a:b:c:[]) &#x3D;&#x3D; f a:f b:f c:[] 
 My current thinking is that it might be possible to express this type of transform on the type level somehow, but It&#x27;s not clear to me how.
 The purpose of this would be to have a neat way to relate the element type to the array type, so I&#x27;d have something like
 CompArray (a  b  c  ()) ~ Array a  Array b  Array c  () 
 Any ideas on how to express this, or is it not possible to do this kind of type level programming in Haskell?

                              <span>So my employer is forcing us to not use Intellij, we HAVE to use VS Code now. They will even scan our computers to make sure we don&#x27;t have intellij installed... yeah. 
 So thing is that we are on sbt 13.18. We got a lot going on right now and upgrading sbt is not something we want to do in the next month (we have 2 months to transition to VS Code). 
 From what I understand, to get any kind of useful IDE features in VS Code, you need to use Scala Metals, but Scala metals only works with sbt 1.0+? 
 I tried running some basic metals commands and they don&#x27;t seem to exist for my version of sbt. Is there any sub 1.0+ version that supports metals? What is my best option here? 
 Or am I just making stuff up and I have no idea what I&#x27;m talking about?

                              <span>Recently I switched from vim to emacs, and I&#x27;m building my configuration as I go. I configured most of the editor as I needed it. but there are some custom actions that I don&#x27;t know how to achieve in emacs. 
 Basically I had custom functions for fuzzy finder (in my case it was fzf) to call an external program for list of data (i.e. the stdout lines) and select the line using the fuzzy finder then pass it to another external program which returned the path of the file and then I could use edit command to open that file in a new buffer.
 I want to do the same thing in emacs mini-buffer but I don&#x27;t know where to start. I&#x27;ve read the chapter about completion in the emacs manual but could not understand anything...
 It worth mentioning that I use vertico, marginalia and ordderless packages and It would be nice to use the marginalia to show more information about the items / files.

 Any ideas on how to resolve? Google/ChatGPT came up short.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Started getting into emacs, and trying to get mu4e to work nicely with my university email, which unfortunately is provided by google. So far I&#x27;ve managed to get the receiving part working by invoking oama, but I can&#x27;t get the smtp part working. Using this configuration:
  (make-mu4e-context :name &quot;EMTA&quot; :match-func (lambda (msg) (when msg (string-prefix-p &quot;/emta&quot;(mu4e-message-field msg :maildir)))) :vars &#x27;((user-mail-address . &quot;myemail@uni.ee&quot;) (user-full-name . &quot;Kenneth Flak&quot;) (smtpmail-smtp-server . &quot;smtp.gmail.com&quot;) (smtpmail-auth-credentials . (secrets-get-secret &quot;Default keyring&quot; &quot;oama - myemail@gmail.com&quot;)) (smtpmail-stream-type . ssl) (smtpmail-smtp-service . 465) ... etc...  I am pretty sure the culprit is the smtpmail-auth-credentials part, but I don&#x27;t know enough elisp yet to debug.
 Any help much appreciated!

                              <span>Hello, I have been learning Emacs for a couple months now, and I am getting used to the Emacs shortcuts (or mayhaps more specifically the readline shortcuts). 
 If you found a way to modify the shortcuts on applications (maybe through the OS itself), I&#x27;d love to hear about it!
 I am using KDE6 and Tumbleweed as my Distro!

                              <span>I have built emacs from git before. I want to build it from master with the same options I used last time. The variable system-configuration-options has the value &quot;--with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter&quot;. So I pulled from the repo, and checked out master (I checked this had worked and the last commit in my local repo is from three hours ago). I ran make clean to clean the repo, then ./autogen.sh, and then ./configure --with-json --with-xwidgets --with-tree-sitter, literally just copying in the flags that my current emacs tells me I used to configure the build last time. ./configure runs, but the first and lines of the output say configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --with-json.
 I&#x27;m not sure what to do about this. I want to build with proper json support like I currently have. I can&#x27;t find anything in NEWS or the changelogs about this build option being deprecated, and searching the devel list archives doesn&#x27;t bring up anything.
 Questions: - why is this option not recogized? - how should I configure my build to get proper json support?
 TIA!

                              <span>Discovering the (org--insert-structure-template-unique-keys KEYS) function leads me to believe that 2 key is the maximum.
 Can&#x27;t the code be adapted to support more keys? 3 would be nice.
 Make a list of unique, two characters long elements from KEYS. Elements of length one have a tab appended. Elements of length two are kept as is. Longer elements are truncated to length two. If an element cannot be made unique, an error is raised.

                              <span>I often work with a remote emacs over X11 and ssh, and for the most part the lag is tolerable. Apart from took tips. When I click a mouse on the frame, or switch frames, the tooltip either pops up, or displays in the echo area. And stays there far longer than the tooltip-hide-delay (set to one second,). Emacs accepts no inputs for as long as ten seconds unless I aggressively pound Ctrl-g. At this point I am almost at the point of patching tooltips out on the source. 
 Help?
 I am running emacs from git, if that makes a difference.

                              <span>I’ve been using Obsidan and before that notion for different notes and such, but I’d love to move to something like org-mode but not sure how or where to start. 
 I have experience with both doom Mac’s and neovim as well so vim keybinds are somewhat comfy.
