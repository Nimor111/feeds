 Would it be possible to provide guidance on the basic features of lsp-mode? For instance:
  
I thought lsp-ui would render flymake obsolete but it appears that it is necessary for documentation-on-hover.
 What is needed to detect the error in the while statement (raed)?
 I&#x27;m getting auto-completion inside *.el files even though no corresponding mode has been selected inside lsp&#x27;s configuration (unlike sh): where does it come from?
 What is needed got get auto-completion inside org source block?

                              <span>[SOLVED]
 I just built the latest Emacs on Ubuntu 22.04:
 GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2024-06-20 
 It starts with a 10-point font no matter what I do. I&#x27;m using the same config that works fine on older versions of Emacs and always starts with a larger font. If I use &gt; Options &gt; Set Default Font, I can select a font that works for *that session only*. If I click on &gt; Options &gt; Save Options, it adds this to my .emacs:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(default ((t (:family &quot;Ubuntu Mono&quot; :foundry &quot;DAMA&quot; :slant normal :weight regular :height 143 :width normal))))) 
 Upon reopening Emacs, the font is back to 10 point. This basically makes Emacs 29 unusable.

                              <span>Hey. I wondered how, or if, you guys setup your editor indentation, comment and general source code formatting rules, on a per-project basis, and how well that works with projects using external source formatter configurations?
 For instance, if working on a C/C++/Python project using clang-format, ruff, gnu-indent, or uncrustify to format its source, how do you tell your Emacs to use the same rules according to their settings? Also, how do you keep this on a per-project basis (.dir-locals or similar) ?
 Any advice or anecdotes are welcome :-)

                              <span>What are the best practices to keep your emacs environment in sync across multiple devices? I&#x27;ve always used SyncThing to sync what emacs considers my HOME folder between devices, but I&#x27;ve encountered some problems below with my ELPA folder where packages are installed (&quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa&quot;).
 Specifically I noticed that when I upgraded emacs from version 28 to 29 on one machine and then upgraded some packages like pdf-tools and org-mode on that machine, those packages (which SyncThing synced to my other devices) no longer worked on the machines still running emacs 28 because emacs 29 has some new functions that those two packages use, like defvar-1.
 So should I have different ELPA folders for different versions of emacs, e.g., by putting a line in my init.el like (setq package-user-dir (concat &quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa-&quot; emacs-version))?
 Thanks!

 I like the idea and expressiveness of such documentation, but I am never going to run my code through a doc formatter like Doxygen, but it would be helpful if Emacs could make use of it.
 Eldoc shows my function and the parameter names, but none of the available docs for each parameter.

It would also work if I can set the schema at Postgres-simple level…maybe while creating the connection. I looked around for other languages, there are some solutions that says you can pass in key&#x3D;value parameter in the connection string with your current schema&#x3D; . I didn’t try it because there is no mention of it jn postgres documentation.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I’m starting a new Haskell Meetup in the SF Bay Area. If you’re in the bay area and are using Haskell, check it out below.
 We aim to focus a lot on real world aspects of Haskell, specifically on web applications.

 I&#x27;m using Jaxson Van Dorn&#x27;s invoice template from here: https://github.com/woofers/org-invoice-template
 As you can see, the sub-totals for each day are correct, but those subtotals, for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, aren&#x27;t being summed together to arrive at the correct total for the invoice.
 I have scrutinised the formula, but I&#x27;m rather new to org table formulas and find the cell references alone difficult to follow, so I can&#x27;t spot what&#x27;s amiss. Can someone identify what&#x27;s going wrong?

                              <span>This might be kind of an obscure question, but here goes anyway:
 The LaTeX memoir document class has a nice feature to add breaks within a chapter, called \pfbreak (plain/fancy break). What it does is add a couple of lines between paragraphs, when the break is in the middle of the page, and adds 3 asterisks to the top or bottom of the page, when the break is between pages.
 In a regular LaTeX document, I can get it to work fine, but in Org Mode, I&#x27;m struggling. The break in the middle of the page works, but if the break is between pages, I don&#x27;t get the 3 asterisks.
 I figured all I would have to do is add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \documentclass{memoir} to the in-buffer settings, and then use $\pfbreak$ when I wanted to add a break, which seems to be somewhat right, since it works in the middle of a page. Just not the end.
 Any way I can track down what I&#x27;m missing, or if this will even work in Org Mode?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
I&#x27;ve honestly avoided writing this post because I don&#x27;t think I am accurately conveying the issues I&#x27;m having but I do really want feedback from you all - Here are some things I&#x27;m struggling with.
So first of all, I notice that I&#x27;m really stuck in my ways and often seem to write essays rather than notes. In order to avoid stressing about a note being atomic, I try to allow my notes to build up until they naturally can be broken down. However, by then, I feel like the statements are too intertwined and codependent and then I struggle to break things down. This is mainly referring to things I write about from background knowledge but happens with referenced things too.
I really want to know how other people structure arguments, claims they don&#x27;t believe, and things they don&#x27;t…</span>

                              <span>One of the key features of Nickel is the merge system, which is a clever way of combining records, and allows defining complex configurations in a modular way.
This system is inspired by (amongst others) the NixOS module system, which are the magic bits that tie together NixOS configurations and gives NixOS its insane flexibility.
Nickel merging and NixOS modules work slightly differently under the hood, and target slightly different use-cases:
Nickel merge is designed to combine several pieces of configurations which all respect the same contract. This allows an application developer to define the interface of its configuration, and have the user write it in a modular way.
NixOS modules, on the other hand, are designed to combine pieces which not only define a part of the final configurat…</span>

 Coming to vim, I would typically navigate my file system through basic shell commands like cd and would then edit the files with vim filename.txt.
 With emacs, instead of using dired to open files, is there a way I could directly open them using vterm?

                              <span>One common concern with emacs&#x27;s included terminal modes is that they used to run on interpreted elisp code that&#x27;s the reason alternatives such as vterm outperform it. But now that there&#x27;s native compilation I cannot help but wonder if there&#x27;s really that much of a difference

 I&#x27;m using the scheme layer in spacemacs. Here is my config
 scheme-implementations &#x27;(mit) geiser-mit-binary &quot;/path/to/mit-scheme&quot; geiser-default-implementation &#x27;mit 
 The person who closest ran into this issue I could find it seems like this person:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nnuapw/geiser_not_sending_correct_code_to_chicken_repl/
 They were using chicken scheme and it seems like some chicken scheme command fixed it.
 The closest analog I can think of with mit-scheme is there is a Setup.sh script to run (which I haven&#x27;t), though it seems this requires an already working mit-scheme compiler 😵‍💫
 I am able to run code fine in the geiser REPL 👍

                              <span>I want to create a (mode? package?) that behaves like a tui. The content should be read-only, but on key press I want to fetch data from a server, generate a collapsible/expandable tree from the result, be able to navigate the items and trigger further actions on the focussed items by more keypresses.
 I&#x27;m new to elisp, but data fetching, parsing etc. is not what gives me a headache - I&#x27;m familiar enough with Clojure to have a grap of lisps and willing to learn the language &quot;enough&quot;.
 The great unknown for me are the emacs internals on how to actually build the ui. Are there any introductions, tutorials or simple examples I can use to learn from? I could start with magit, which does all what I&#x27;d like incredibly well, but I feel like that&#x27;s a little over my head ;)
 Of course, best practices for fetching and parsing JSON are appreciated, too.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to write a function that returns an IO[Int] that might have a NOT_FOUND or DUPLICATE error. What would be the best way to write this function?
 Any blogs or videos that discuss about this topic? I&#x27;m confused onwhat the best practice in scala is. I hate java style exceptions and prefer error as values.
 If you can give me an example method or repo for doing this that would be nice.
 Edit: I&#x27;m not trying to make an app. I want to know what the usual way in scala is so that I can read scala codebases

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to scala and I am using vscode with Metals to code. However, when I create a project and import the build following the tip of Metals , Metals will be stuck on indexing even longer than 20min. It also cant navigate to the source of lib.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. THX !

                              <span>I want to use Haskell for back-end (paired with Elm for front-end), but I&#x27;m not sure about committing to it for two reasons:
  
Haskell&#x27;s compiler error messages are confusing and feel unhelpful to me. I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Elm and Rust, and languages like Gleam seem to incorporate a similar style of compiler messaging I appreciate.
 I&#x27;ve heard that Haskell is difficult to maintain in the long run. When it comes to packages in my experience, cabal feels a bit less organized in comparison to package systems like Elm&#x27;s or Crate for Rust.
  
Are there solutions that could make Haskell a winning choice for a language in these aspects, or would I be better to go with something else?
 (As a side note, I admire the direction of Richard Feldman&#x27;s language Roc, but as it is still a developing language, I would not be keen to invest in that too much at the moment. If you think it&#x27;s worth it, maybe let me know.)

                              <span>So this is a little bit strange, but I cannot see any reason why this shouldn&#x27;t be possible, using various low-level GHC runtime functions etc.
 I want a function that looks like this:
 writeExecutable :: FilePath -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () 
 Calling writeExecutable fpath action on a Linux machine should create a Linux executable file at fpath that, when run, runs action as if it were main of that executable.
 To be a bit more specific regarding pre-existing state, I want
 writeExecutable fpath action args &lt;- System.Environment.getArgs System.Posix.Process.executeFile fpath args Nothing 
 and
 action System.Exit.exitSuccess 
 to be essentially equivalent, modulo the created file of course. (Bear in mind executeFile is UNIX exec, which does not create a new process but replaces the current process with new code).
 Why do I want writeExecutable? Because I wrote an interpreter and I want to turn it into a compiler for free.
 Does anyone know of any work that&#x27;s been done in this area (even in another language)?

                              <span>Is there a configuration to force the Ediff window to pop next to the main window instead of on top of it?
 The default position is inconvenient since the Ediff window will be covered if I click on the main window. I&#x27;m always having to move it aside so I can go back to keep looking at the diffs.

                              <span>One day, I tried to reflect on why I don&#x27;t really like EasyMotion-like packages (Avy, Ace-Jump, etc.). It was because they feel too intrusive to my flow - I want to go to a place almost mechanically, without thinking like, &quot;So I need to go to this &#x27;f&#x27; symbol, I should type &#x27;f&#x27;, then wait, read, and type the next symbols one after another&quot; 
 So, I tried to create a package that works the opposite way—you always go to the same place with the same keybindings. E.g., if you type M-s f u p, then you will always be in the top right corner.
 It might be slower at the start, but probably more mechanical, faster, and freeing your head in the end. 
 I wrote an example package and a training game, only to find out later that there exists the package I wanted, but which does it on a system level :) And it is https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/

                              <span>Hey!
 At work we use 2 indentation styles:
 void shortFunction(int arg1, int arg2, // ..., int argN, int argM) { // ... } void SomeClass::AndAnotherInnerScope::veryLongFunctionNameJustForFun( SomeOtherVeryLongTypeName arg1, int arg2, std::string arg3, ) { // ... } 
 Default tree-sitter indent rules can&#x27;t cope with that. They weally want to align all arguments to an opening brace, turning second function declaration into a mess.
 I have written my own indentation rule, maybe ugly, but it get the job done.
 It tries to indent first argument by 4 spaces if it is on its own line, and doesn&#x27;t move it at all otherwise, and everything else is aligned to it.
 (defun lazy/smart-indent (node parent bol &amp;rest _) (let ((first-real-child (treesit-node-child parent 1))) (if (or (not node) (treesit-node-eq node first-real-child)) (save-excursion (goto-char (treesit-node-start parent)) (back-to-indentation) (+ (point) 4)) (treesit-node-start first-real-child)))) 
 Then I had to create my own c-ts indentation style where I changed 2 rules: for argument lists and parameter lists to this:
 ((parent-is &quot;argument_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) ((parent-is &quot;parameter_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) 
 I don&#x27;t know a good way to do it other than copy existingy styles and patch in place.
 Hope it helps someone.

                              <span>I like vc as a lightweight alternative to magit. The problem is like this: I just commit all my changes to git, but I found a mistake in the message. I want to modify the log message, but the function vc-git-log-edit-toggle-amend seems to work only in the log-edit-mode buffer, which I don&#x27;t know how to invoke without committing changes. 
 Does anybody know a solution to this issue? Thanks.

 I&#x27;m relatively new to Emacs, I&#x27;ve watched a few SystemCrafters videos, flipped through the documentation and tutorials. I&#x27;ve started writing my config, but it still looks far from what I want it to look like...
 So I&#x27;m here with a question: where can I find more variety of good cofigs for inspiration (and possibly for use)? The usual search on the net and on github gives mostly very outdated builds(
 For the context, I&#x27;ve been on Arch Linux for two years now, I&#x27;m switching to emacs from obidian, and I want to fit most of my activities into emacs: PKM (org-roam), Task manager, programming (C, Python, JS), etc

 Has anyone experienced this bug with poly-org and org-mode 9.7? 
 https://github.com/polymode/poly-org/issues/49
 I see the issue when the buffer glitches from top to bottom, with the cursor moving line by line too fast. It&#x27;s basically unworkable at this state. 
 My solution is to stay in 9.6 until there is a permanent solution for it. 
 Best.

                              <span>Hey, ive worked a lot with haskell. A friend teached me everything. What i didnt know: He manaager everything in the background, from giving me packages to using stack. So im sitting here without any knowledge about that. I only know the Syntax.
 Is there a way to gather all the knowledge in one course?

Some libraries will be buggy and some libraries are not a good fit in some situations. I also want a library that is simple but I don&#x27;t mind losing some simplicity for power(performance, capability etc). I want to make Conway&#x27;s game of life like automata based artwork. Where entities interact with each other and through emergence create complex structures, groupings and behavioral patterns. Based on my needs can someone point to me the best library, tool etc

 I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to use MonadError here. Im new to scala and dont understand the syntax that well.
 Edit:
 I tried doing this
 class LiveVendors[F[_]] private ( xa: Transactor[F] )(implicit ME: MonadError[F, String]) 
 But Im getting No given instance of type cats.MonadError[F, String] was found for parameter ME of constructor LiveVendors in class LiveVendors in the apply method

 This post is not specific to Scala but I like this community so I ask it here.
 What do you think makes more sense for testing API status code and messages returned to the client? Unit testing (and mocking your services)?
 Or Integration testing to test with the real system?
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m an experienced Scala dev currently working through a consultancy for US clients. Lately I&#x27;ve been looking around for Scala jobs in LinkedIn and stuff, but it seems like all dev jobs are either US or Europe based.
 Does anyone have any tips for the job search taking that into account? As an aside, I&#x27;d rather not relocate right now, but I&#x27;m open to it in the future.

                              <span>I should just use old pinned stack resolver versions but I have a small compulsion to update the resolver versions of my many little projects to the latest LTS version.
 life is so much easier if I add allow-newer:true in each project’s stack.yaml file.
 It seems a little sloppy doing this, but are there specific reasons why this is a bad idea?
 thanks in advance for any advice.

 I&#x27;m not a programmer, am a writer looking to switch his primary digital writing process from Obsidian to Emacs, specifically Org Mode and Org Roam.

I will keep on learning Emacs itself and the key commands and such as I go on, but today I wanted to get started actually using it (haven&#x27;t really worked the last few days as I spent time just reading about whether Emacs is worth it, then started to dip my toes into the water). Honestly I just wanted to make an org file to list the three dozen odd tabs I have open for various Emacs resources. N…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using text-scale-increase|decrease for awhile, but it only works on one buffer at a time, doesn&#x27;t affect the modeline, and so forth. Since most of the time I&#x27;m on very large monitors, I have the base font size set to be readable there, though sometimes I&#x27;m on the laptop and need it to scale down a little bit.
 I&#x27;ve done some searching for solutions but seems like the only ones I&#x27;ve come up with are from EmacsWiki (zoom-frm.el). This is fine, but also seems like it requires a lot of additional packages, also from EmacsWiki. 
 Anyone ever tried these solutions? I can go searching through EmacsWiki for all the dependencies and download them if I need to, but the Git repo is absolutely gigantic to try to get small amounts of packages so a bit of a pain. But if they&#x27;re the miracle cure, I&#x27;ll do what it takes.
 Also open to other packages that do the job. Just would like to control the text when the laptop is hooked up to dock with big monitors, and when it&#x27;s just a laptop.

I wanted to try and give emacs a go because I&#x27;ve heard good things about it. However, I&#x27;m a bit confused on how to get started with it. Anyone have any resources they recommend to get started? Thanks. Also, i&#x27;m wanting to learn C and use emacs as my IDE, I&#x27;m on MacOs. I previously learned javascript for around 8 months.

 Everything works as expected only if I compile from a buffer open with main.tex, but not with any of the chapter files in the sections directory.
  (use-package latex-mode :init (setq TeX-view-program-selection &#x27;((output-pdf &quot;PDF Viewer&quot;)) TeX-view-program-list &#x60;((&quot;PDF Viewer&quot; ,(concat &quot;/Applications/Skim.app&quot; &quot;/Contents&quot; &quot;/SharedSupport/displayline&quot; &quot; -b -g %n %o %b&quot;)))) :hook (LaTeX-mode . auto-fill-mode) (LaTeX-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (LaTeX-mode . tex-source-correlate-mode) (LaTeX-mode . reftex-mode) (LaTeX-mode . visual-line-mode) (LaTeX-mode . (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;TeX-view) (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t line-spacing 3 fill-column 80 TeX-command-default &quot;LaTeX Make&quot;))) :mode &quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot;) 
 In main.tex, I have the following at the end of the document.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: t %%% End: 
 And in all other TeX files, I have the following.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: &quot;../paper&quot; %%% End:

                              <span>I&#x27;m running pretty recent Emacs 29.3 PGTK build, with Org 9.7.4 and pdf-tools 1.1.0
 When exporting an org file as PDF with preview, Emacs creates a new window showing the PDF correctly but also switches the current org-mode buffer to show the same PDF file, as show in this screencast recording.
 It also seems to create a new frame showing the PDF if current frame is &quot;too small&quot;, which is not an issue for me.
 What annoys me is something switches the org-mode buffer to the PDF viewing buffer.
 I do not have &#x60;display-buffer-alist&#x60; rules regarding pdf-tools buffers.
 Have any of you seen this before?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I heavily use org-mode src blocks, normally with the ob-shell extension (sh, bash...), I previously worked in a MacOS system where the installation is a little complex, but can be done. Now, I recently got the opportunity to change systems so, I did.
 In a new Debian 12 installation, I have my Emacs installation and, when testing Src code blocks with *:async*, I noticed that my Emacs was still being blocked. This is a fresh installation.
 What I did:
 Run a src code block from the documentation that worked on the MacOS system, but didn&#x27;t in the Debian. Async should put an ID and then replace it:
  
+begin_src bash :session execute-asynchronously :async yes
 echo &quot;Execute session blocks in the background&quot;
 sleep 20
 echo &quot;Using the :async header&quot;
 +end_src
  
What happened:
  
In MacOS, an ID is put in the results, Emacs doesn&#x27;t get worked and after the 20 seconds I get the result. Works perfectly.
 
In Debian, Emacs gets blocked, with the message &#x27;Executing Bash code block at position 480&#x27;.
 
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Emacs -Q for a minimal example, same issue.
 
Searched for the ob-async github, nothing related and, no &#x27;requirements&#x27; I may have missed, or packages.
 
Searched the web for answers, apparently, this is not an issue that I can find logs about, and given that I am in a new installation, I&#x27;m at a loss at what else to check... 
 
 At this point, I&#x27;m not sure what do debug, since usage of src code blocks is a must and, the support of Emacs in Linux should be better as I understand, for example, I don&#x27;t have issues with gpg in Debian, while I couldn&#x27;t configure it on MacOS.
 Thanks!

                              <span>emacs master branch has an updated file that I&#x27;d like to use rather than the version included with emacs 29.1. Preferably, I would use a URL pointing to the raw file on github, but could cope with a file downloaded to local storage.
 I really want to use this file as a drop-in replacement for use with use-package.
 Update: I&#x27;ve discovered :load-path so that answers the local-storage part

The servers were upgraded and some trivial maintenance needed to be done (bump the PHP version by +0.1).

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I have ADHD and it is a struggle to clean up my tasks or rather doing them, I mean I love how I can capture any idea and any to-do for a given project, but doing them ... that is a whole other story. 
 I recently read about how gamification can help people with instant feedback problems, to better work if their tasks are gamified. So my question is, is there a way in emacs, to implement like a point system for tasks, like when im capturing a to-do, give it an value or link the prio of the task to points and at the end of the month, get like a highscore or somehting?
 I was just wondering, if anyone did something like this and can help someone out who is really in need of something like this :D
 Thank you all, and a happy day to you all!

                              <span>As in the title i have been offered two different roles. This would be my first job after a bootcamp. 
 One is in Scala, it provides a high level of training and supervision and you work with big clients but my fear is whether Scala is future proof as someone beginning their career. 
 The other is in C# in a very small company. I hope the training will be good but there will only be 4 of us so we&#x27;ll have to see. 
 currently living in the UK but planning on moving to the USA in a year or so?

                              <span>Just wanted to see if anyone here could help me brainstorm a setup using org roam dailies to track my phyisical fitness / lifting goals. I&#x27;d like to use org roam dailies to track my body weight, some measurements, my workout lifts, and possibly progress photos sporadically as well. Org roam dailies stores information in a one-file-per-day system where each file is named after the date. I&#x27;m comfortable with the templating required to make information entry quick and easy in this system, and have already been tracking all of this on pen and paper for over a year. Organizing and inputting this information is something I&#x27;ve already figured out for myself. I can get somewhat close-ish to the functionality I&#x27;m looking for with org-ql, but can&#x27;t quite get the feedback I&#x27;d like displayed the way I want. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to be able to make line charts of certain tagged entries in the daily file and plot them over time. Certain things will not be in every single entry. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to accomplish this, I have not found the right plugin yet.
 Has anyone here ever used emacs to analyze information this way?

                              <span>I am trying to define a custom coding system for PETSCII, that currently uses a custom font with the appropriate symbols in a Unicode Private Use Block #xE000-#xE100. Eventually I&#x27;ll switch to the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, but for now...
 Finding useful documentation (or even code samples) for creating coding systems has been difficult - any pointers greatly appreciated. At present, the code below 1) decodes the PETSCII properly, but only 7-bits. Characters &gt;#x7F do not get translated. 2) Does not encode properly at all. Everything below #x7F gets translated to #x20 on writing.
 I&#x27;m being overly-explicit with some of this code, so excuse the verbosity. I did not include the entirety of &#x27;petscii-unicode-map&#x27; here for brevity, but it&#x27;s just a one-to-one mapping (and I&#x27;m hard-coding un-printable symbols ATM):
 (defvar petscii-unicode-map &#x27;((#x0 . #xE41D) (#x1 . #xE41D) (#x2 . #xE41D) (#x3 . #xE41D) [...] (#x3C . #xE03C) (#x3D . #xE03D) (#x3E . #xE03E) (#x3F . #xE03F) (#x40 . #xE000) (#x41 . #xE001) (#x42 . #xE002) (#x43 . #xE003) [...] (#xFC . #xE07C) (#xFD . #xE07D) (#xFE . #xE07E) (#xFF . #xE07F))) 
 Then I define a charset (which seems to work), an encode and decode translation-table, then the coding-system itself.
 (define-charset &#x27;petscii-standard &quot;PETSCII coding&quot; :dimension 1 :code-space [0 255] :map (seq-into (flatten-list petscii-unicode-map) &#x27;vector)) (defvar petscii-decode-table (make-translation-table petscii-unicode-map)) (defvar petscii-encode-table (make-translation-table (mapcar (lambda (v) (cons (cdr v) (car v))) petscii-unicode-map))) (define-coding-system &#x27;standard-petscii &quot;PETSCII coding system&quot; :mnemonic ?P :coding-type &#x27;charset :eol-type &#x27;mac :ascii-compatible-p nil :charset-list &#x27;petscii-standard :decode-translation-table petscii-decode-table :encode-translation-table petscii-encode-table) 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve dug through mule-conf.el and a few other bits of existing elisp, to no avail.

                              <span>I posted a week or so ago about a problem with consult-register-load. I get this error when using consult-register-load or consult-register-save. Both of these functions work but they do not display the little mini buffer info with the preview and the optional do what you mean stuff that makes consult-register so great.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) register-read-with-preview-traditional: Non-character input-event 
 This morning I took another swing at working on tracking down this bug. I put together a basic init.el file and ran emacs with -q -l test.el. Then I used M-x package-install-file. Directed it to the consult folder my regular emacs init file uses and found that consult-register-load works flawlessly. So I can eliminate the possibility that this was a bug in consult conflicting with the fact that I&#x27;m running emacs 30 or that emacs 30 it self had an issue.
 On the emacs wiki page about timers this line jumped out at me. Seems clear that it is the heart of my problem but I don&#x27;t know what to do to try and isolate or resolve it.
  
This predicate function returns non-nil if object is a timer.
  
I don&#x27;t know enough elisp to understand what that means. I&#x27;m also confused by what is going on in consult-register.el. Without a deeper understanding of what the offending functions in consult-register.el are doing. I don&#x27;t know how to proceed. Could someone explain it for me? Any tips on debugging this? Any and all suggestions welcome.
 Full emacs config.

                              <span>This question is just to satisfy my curiosity. Looking in the site-start.d I notice that asy-mode.el is loaded at the start of the load process. As I understand it, this mode is for the editing of asymptote vector graphics files (something I never do) and so I was wondering why it is autoloaded so soon? Does anyone know? Is it required by another crucial package?

                              <span>Is there a function which i can use, to select specific git commit for git directory and browse its files in dired-like interface? 
 kinda like a history file browser of that git project
 best answer i found was https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24993868/how-do-you-list-tracked-files-git-ls-files-in-magit:
  
use M-&amp; git ls-files -z | xargs -0 -- ls -ld followed by M-x dired-virtual RET. The latter requires the dired-x library to be loaded.
  
problem with this, is when i open file from that buffer, i want it to open version of that file from that specific git commit, but it opens in current work dir

                              <span>org-transclusion-http is an extension for org-transclusion that lets you transclude content over HTTP. If you have pandoc installed on your system, org-transclusion will convert HTML documents to Org format and transclude them. It handles link anchors (&quot;fragments&quot;) in HTML as well as Org mode documents.
 After installing org-transclusion-http, run M-x org-transclusion-add-all in an org-mode buffer containing the following text:
 # Transclude ~org-mode~ document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.org#emacs]] # Transclude HTML document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.html#emacs]] 
 If you are connected to the internet and you have pandoc installed, the contents of those two files should asynchronously load, and the section of each document which matches the #emacs tag will be displayed in place of each #+transclude: link.
 org-transclusion-http is now available on NonGNU ELPA, so you can try it out on Emacs 28+ by running M-x package-refresh-contents then M-x package-install RET org-transclusion-http!

                              <span>I am, I believe, about to embark on a large Emacs project, described a little in this footnote[1]. Let&#x27;s call it Hode. In each hode-mode buffer, there will be some text, and parts of that text will correspond to objects in a TypeDB database. It will need to keep track of (among other things, surely) those correspondences.
 This means I&#x27;ll have to things in memory that are invisible to the user. The only kind of state I&#x27;ve manipulated previously in Emacs is the text itself.
 The only idea I&#x27;ve come up with so far is to define some global variables starting with &quot;hode-state-&quot;, and hope a user doesn&#x27;t clobber those names.
 Is that how it&#x27;s done?
 [1] It will use Emacs as a frontend to a TypeDB database, allowing users to maintain personal knowledge bases, like org-roam but with more structure.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a package that allows the execution and editing of Pharo &quot;scripts&quot; from Emacs and have come across shampoo-mode and Literate-Smalltalk (Github)
 Off the two literate-smalltalk appears to be the more up to date one.
 The links for shampoo-mode are
 project page in melpa,
 Shampoo mode for Emacs,
 Smalltalk image-side server that provides a remote access to an image,
 and Shampoo SqueakSource which seems to have more support for Pharo.
 
 Does anyone have some familiarity with these two packages?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to announce a new release of csound-expression on hackage. The CE is a music framework for haskell with focus on ease of use and feature rich as it rides on top of the powerful audio programming language Csound. It is a DSL to build Csound programs. So the library embeds Csound in Haskell. 
 It&#x27;s a bug fix release. Many algorithms in the low-level renderer csound-expression-dynamic were rewritten and fixed. In the previous version unforunately there were severe bugs in effectful expressions and in if-then-else blocks. But now they are fixed. 
 Also I&#x27;ve updated the library to include new Csound opcodes (audio processing units from 6.18 version).
 Happy music making with Haskell!
 About the future of the csound-expression:
 I&#x27;ve started the implementation of more tiny csound-core package. It offers a missing layer of low-level building of type-safe Csound expressions. In the previous version I&#x27;ve created lots of abstractions to make music making more pleasant for FP style. But this layering makes it kind of hard to debug rendered code. So I&#x27;d like to create a tiny imperative style core that will allow me to debug produced Csound code. And the rest of the code should be expressed in terms of this library. I&#x27;m not there yet. I&#x27;ve built the core library and it turned out very well. But now I need to rewrite FP abstractions on top of it. I&#x27;m not there yet. But I hope that gradually I will make it. 
 Also I plan to deprecate GUI features as FLTK was deprecated in Csound and it&#x27;s not packaged with Csound anymore. I think maybe it would be better to substitute them with JS+OSC.

                              <span>Does anyone else have this issue? If the cursor is on the far right side of a line which is folded you can&#x27;t move it to the left. It just says &#x27;beginning of line&#x27; at the bottom. 
 I&#x27;m using evil mode and it works when I&#x27;m in insert mode, but not in normal mode. So, maybe it&#x27;s related to evil? I tried to figure it out using chatGPT, but I couldn&#x27;t find a simple answer.

 00:00 : navigating and editing trees and list using navigation commands : https://orgmode.org/manual/Motion.html cycling (also works for src blocks) https://orgmode.org/manual/Global-and-local-cycling.html structure editing : https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html 00:16 : adding src block : C- s then type desired language (bash, python, ...) 01:00 : entering a src block editing mode, C-&#x27; then launching python console C-p and select desired code, then send it to console with C-r 01:17 : save and quit src block editing C-&#x27; 01:44 : add time stamp, C-u C-u C-c . 01:50 : cycle through todo-keywords C-c C-t 
 There are tons of other features that I don&#x27;t show, of course. I.e, embedding src block results and plots directly in org mode, jupyter-like style; isolating (sub)tree in buffer; tangle block code; calendar and time alerts; ... I&#x27;m far from exploiting the full potential of orgmode. But bit by bit, it progresses. I would say I usually learn (or rediscover ) one or two new shortcuts/feature a week, on average.
 Being able to I-search a keyword in my whole work is probably one of the most time saving feature of working in a single file. I can easily copy and look up for some code or notes I&#x27;ve written already.

                              <span>My manager informed me that I&#x27;ll be moving to a new team by the end of the year to work mainly with Scala. I have half a year to prepare to that and to be honest I&#x27;ve been avoiding this as the plague because I find Scala utterly complicated. I&#x27;ll dearly miss the simplicity of Go with errors as values and everything being async IO by default.
 My first question is: if you had to move from Go to Scala how it was your journey?
 Second, do you need to deal with exceptions everywhere like in Java doing Scala FP? And, how can I know which function will/can throw an exception? For example, in Scala is pretty normal to consume Java libraries, how can I know if I need to put a try/catch?

                              <span>I&#x27;m having issues with the Svelte lsp server, using emacs 29 w/ nativecomp and lsp-mode:
  
No highlighting or echo area information when hovering over stuff
 The autocomplete is weirdly sluggish 
 If something is lsp-renamed in a .ts file, the changes are not reflected in .svelte files, and vice versa
  
On the other hand, the typescript server is snappy and seems to work as expected, so now I suspect something may be amiss with the svelte server, and/or the lsp integration.
 The problem persists with the following simple config:
 (setq-default package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)) load-prefer-newer t) (setq-default use-package-always-ensure t) (require &#x27;use-package) (use-package typescript-mode) (use-package web-mode :mode ((&quot;\\.html\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode) (&quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot; . svelte-mode)) :config (define-derived-mode svelte-mode web-mode &quot;Svelte&quot;) (setq web-mode-engines-alist &#x27;((&quot;svelte&quot; . &quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot;)))) (use-package company :config (global-company-mode)) (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp) :hook (((typescript-mode svelte-mode) . lsp))) 
 I hope someone can help out, I have no idea how to solve the problem. It seems few people develop svelte using emacs, so it&#x27;s hard to find information

                              <span>Is there a reliable way to set the weight of the default and italic faces dynamically?
 This isn&#x27;t working:
  (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :weight &#x27;light) 
 I tried with various fonts including Iosevka and Fira Code. I can set the font to &quot;Light&quot; using the &quot;Options | Set Default Font&quot; menu option. I want to do it in elisp though, to auto-toggle between light and regular depending on whether I&#x27;m using a dark or a light theme. (A lighter weight can look nicer with dark themes.)
 Curiously setting it to a bold weight does work. In one case the font I tried didn&#x27;t even have a bold weight, but Emacs synthesized it. Which is cool, but I can&#x27;t set it to a light weight using elisp.
 I tried using the :fontattribute and building a font spec string manually, but it was inconsistent. Sometimes it would take effect, other times not, and I couldn&#x27;t set the italicface to light and italic.

                              <span>I just added a simple plugin into my new dwm status bar (project page, github) to show the current clocked-in task of org mode. It helps concentrating on the current task and reminds to turn the clock off on time especially if you are doing your work outside of emacs.

                              <span>Hey fellow Emacs users!
 I’ve been working on a Bash script to simplify running Emacs and Emacsclient, and I wanted to share it with you all. Whether you’re frequently starting and stopping Emacs servers or switching between different profiles, this script can save you time and streamline your workflow.
 Here’s what it does:
  
Start an Emacs server with a specified profile or initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in terminal or GUI mode based on provided arguments.
 Kill running Emacs servers easily.
 List available Emacs server socket files.
  
How to use it:
 (assuming you added the script to your path)
 Help Message:
 ec -h 
 Displays the usage message with all available options.
 Script Version:
 ec -v 
 Shows the script version.
 Start Emacs Server with Profile:
 ec -p my-profile 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified profile.
 Start Emacs Server with Init Directory:
 ec -i /path/to/init-directory 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in Terminal Mode:
 ec -nw 
 Opens Emacsclient in terminal mode.
 Kill Emacs Server:
 ec -k 
 Kills the Emacs server processes.
 List Socket Files:
 ec -l 
 Lists the available socket files for Emacs servers.
 EmacsClient Options are supported
 All the regular emacsclient options are supported, so you can for example specify a different server to run it, for example:
 Create an emacs server in org mode
 emacs --bg-daemon&#x3D;demo-server --init-directory ~/init-directory/testing-org-config 
 use ec to open emacsclient with daemon named demo-server on line 23 of a file
 ec -s demo-server +23 ~/my-file.org

                              <span>The org mode habit tracker is really nice if you&#x27;ve ever used it. It has inspired me to try something similar. However, I don&#x27;t love the Emacs Lisp source code for it, or for org agenda, it looks somewhat involved and painstaking, I was wondering if there are any more high level libraries for creating images in an emacs buffer, in particular colored images (which presumably would have to implement the coloring through font lock? not sure if there&#x27;s a better way)

                              <span>Next month it&#x27;ll be my zettelkasten first anniversary. Thanks to this forum as well, this has been a very prolific year. Since I started my zettelkasten I have produced more than a thousand zettels, but now I&#x27;m struggling with their organisation.
My current workflow consists of: 
To solve my problem I wanted to slightly change my workflow:
Another concern of mine is about the &quot;granularity&quot; of a structure note. Eg. I have a structure note about philosophy that contains lots of zettels, and I want to subdivide it. Should I subdivide it for book, author or topic? I tend to have a topic-first approach, but maybe a book-first or an author-first approach could provide a simpler structure.</span>

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I&#x27;m trying to define a complex workflow where:
 I get My Github Issues
 #+name: gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe
 #+begin_src sh
 curl --header &quot;PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GitlabPersonalAccessToken}&quot; &quot;https://gitlab.com/api/v4/issues?scope&#x3D;assigned_to_me&quot;
 #+end_src
 I get a specific Issue via iid.
 #+name: getIssue
 #+begin_src sh :stdin gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe() :var iid&#x3D;&quot;&quot;
 jq --arg iid $iid &#x27;.[] | select(.iid &#x3D;&#x3D; ($iid | tonumber))&#x27;
 #+end_src
 I get the description of a specific one via iid too
 #+name: getIssueDescription
 #+begin_src sh :stdin getIssue(iid&#x3D;&quot;2495&quot;)
 jq &#x27;.description&#x27;
 #+end_src
 The problem is that, while this is working:
 +call: getIssue(iid&#x3D;&quot;2495&quot;)
 This is not working, as I&#x27;m still seeing the results of 2495 as in the getIssueDescription definition, I have &quot;2495&quot; still.
 +call:getIssueDescription(iid&#x3D;&quot;2498&quot;)
 I have also tried to put just iid so that I pass it, but no luck.
 So in this case, I want to change the variable of a chain of functions. I&#x27;m still trying but, haven&#x27;t found how...
 Thanks for looking into this specific issue!

                              <span>Hi, has anyone had success using &#x60;eglot-workspace-configuration&#x60; in a &#x60;.dir-locals.el&#x60; to pass configuration to Microsoft&#x27;s PyRight LSP? Am I doing something wrong below or is this not supported by either eglot or pyright?
 I am experienced with directory local variables and elisp, but beginner in pyright and eglot although I have read docs for both.
 ./foo.py:
 import sys import sys print(sys.argv) 
 ./.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:python (:reportDuplicateImport t)))))) 
 &#x60;M-x eglot-show-workspace-configuration&#x60; output:
 { &quot;python&quot;: { &quot;reportDuplicateImport&quot;: true } } 
 In this simple case I expect the duplicate &#x60;import sys&#x60; in the python file to be flagged, but it is not, thus pyright is not using the config. It did use the config and flag the expected python line when I tried using the &quot;pyrightconfig.json&quot; file mentioned in pyright docs. So pyrightconfig.json file works, but in this case I want to use eglot-workspace-configuration. In fact I would like to use a hybrid of both (ie pyrightconfig.json checked into shared repo, and eglot-workspace-configuration on my local machine). Any tips? Thanks.

                              <span>Is Emacs good for developing React Native using TypeScript? I see that the front-end folks who use React Native and React with a million new features seem to lean more towards VS Code. Has anyone been developing extensively in React Native, connecting with emulators, dealing with those exotic CSS libraries (Like Tailwind or css modules) for React, etc., and had a good experience?

 Bonus: If you know of a way I can remove/modify the last tab-bar separator, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.
 Bonus: Remove last separator
 Would I need to modify the tab-bar format function? Do you have tips on inspecting (similar to using describe-face) the face of clickable/non-editable regions (such as the buffer name on the modeline)?
 Edit:
 I managed to achieve the final goal! Here is a screenshot:

 Here is my setup to reproduce it:

 Origin Emacs doc content: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.htm
 Original:
 &quot;Hooks are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs. A hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called on some well-defined occasion. (This is called running the hook.) The individual functions in the list are called the hook functions of the hook. For example, the hook kill-emacs-hook runs just before exiting Emacs (see Exiting Emacs).
 Most hooks are normal hooks. This means that when Emacs runs the hook, it calls each hook function…</span>

                              <span>I am trying out this new &#x27;pattern&#x27; for giving a typed interface on top of Akka actors. Here&#x27;s an example using classic untyped actors (based on https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html):
 import akka.actor.Actor class MyActor extends Actor { private var num &#x3D; 0 def receive &#x3D; { case &quot;incr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; num +&#x3D; 1 case &quot;decr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; num -&#x3D; 1 case &quot;get&quot; &#x3D;&gt; sender() ! num } } object MyActor { trait Trait { def incr: Unit def decr: Unit def get: Future[Int] } class Client(ref: ActorRef) extends Trait { import akka.pattern.ask override def incr: Unit &#x3D; ref ! &quot;incr&quot; override def decr: Unit &#x3D; ref ! &quot;decr&quot; override def get: Future[Int] &#x3D; (ref ? &quot;get&quot;).mapTo[Int] } } 
 This is inspired by the Erlang/Elixir style of having modules with a &#x27;client&#x27; portion that wraps the actor&#x27;s &#x27;protocol&#x27; ie the messages that it sends or receives, in a normal class with normal methods. This &#x27;client&#x27; class in Scala can also implement an interface which can be used by callers to abstract away the &#x27;implementation detail&#x27; of being an actor under the hood.
 val myActorClient &#x3D; new MyActor.Client(ref) myActorClient.incr myActorClient.decr myActorClient.get.map(println)

                              <span>In case no one else mentioned the $(\LaTeX)$ Knowledge package by Thomas Colcombet, I post it here. The package generates hyperlinks to definitions of terms defined in PDF documents. From the description:

  
As readers and reviewers, we have all been irritated, be it a bit or a lot, by not being able to find easily a key definition that was given sometimes hundred pages before (in a PhD thesis for instance). Using the knowledge package, every use of a concept becomes one click away from its definition (in the electronic version of the document), and an index with all its occurrences can be easily maintained (for the printed version of the document). The longer is the document, the more it improves the reader&#x27;s experience, but it already helps in conference papers.


A draft book written with the knowledge package is My First Category Theory Textbook by Ralph Sarkis.
Zettelkasten.de forum members might find the package particularly helpful for $(\LaTeX)$ mathematics documents, but mathematics isn&#x27;t the only application.</span>

                              <span>Hey all, I wanted to share a successful experience of turning my chaotic voice to text brain dump into zettels using a very simple method.
I was going through my journal which I use for fleeting notes and I found a brain dump that I wanted to process into zettels. I kept struggling with figuring out what is important enough for it&#x27;s own note and what belongs inside another note? Also, how do I want to break up these ideas where there are so many different ways I could do so?
I found a post response by @andang76 where he described the &quot;train of thought&quot; method of brainstorming he uses. Instead of using this to brainstorm, I applied this idea to processing a brain storm and it worked amazingly! I wanted to share it here because it seems like such an obvious and simple way to process your not…</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve been playing with FP libraries in Python and JavaScript.
 Because those languages do error handling with their native try catch mechanisms, most of the code I could see that make use of those FP library looks like the following.
 Isn&#x27;t it strange to mix both try/catch and the Either monad?
 I get it. It allows us to keep a full FP error handling core and logic.
 But the function implementations still make use of try catch. There are obviously no way around it.
 Those libraries can be used as FP wrappers.
 I guess the same applies in Scala when using Java libraries.
 What are you thoughts about it?

                              <span>Habits are displayed separately from other tasks on the TODO list. This is great, I like the consistency tracker, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to schedule it. Say I want to run every few days, but I also want to schedule my next run for 4pm on Tuesday. Is there a way to switch between two modes, one where habits are displayed in a block with their consistency graphs, the other where habits are displayed as ordinary TODO items with a repeating block?

                              <span>in neovim there are these plugins like flash.nvim or leap.nvim that instead of using relative line jumping or using the / key to search for your word, you can just trigger the plugin and type two characters from the word your are looking for, the plugin will then suggest another third character when you press it you will jump to your word.
 flash.nvim do other cool stuff like selecting a function or an expression by using treesitter (i really don&#x27;t know how it works really), like you would trigger the plugin in another way and then you will see characters suggestions to where to jump or select.
 is there something like this in eamcs? i&#x27;m sure there is but i didn&#x27;t know what to type in google to find anything
 thanks in advance

                              <span>Sometimes, when I am working on mixed language projects, I find that just inserting std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;we are here 1\n&quot;, std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;we are here 2\n&quot; works well. I copy the first print, then paste it where I want, increment the number, etc.
 Is there a way to write a function where every time I paste something, it increments the number for me? Optionally, does something like this already exist?
 p.s.: I have a snippet where I can increment the number under point, but that means navigating to the number and invoking that function. I would rather keep pasting the snippet and have the correct number show up. Probably a global counter which gets incremented on paste.

                              <span>I have started using Emacs 6 months ago and I love it! I use it for everything, from keeping notes, scheduling tasks to keeping bookmarks.
 Recently, after reading an article on using Emacs as a password manager through auth-info and epa packages, I started to implement it in my own workflow. 
 I wonder if this is seen as a security risk for some reason. I know Emacs is open source and packages are open source but there are many packages one uses and it is not possible to audit everything even if you knew Elisp to that extent (which I don&#x27;t). I am not using some obscure code but lots of some rather well known packages mainly related to org.
 I am somewhat worried that if I use epa package and decrypt some stuff in Emacs that there will be a small posibility that one of tens of packages is spying on me and may see the decrypted data. It seems like a case of paranoia to me but I&#x27;m curious to what your thoughts on this are.

 I&#x27;m using doom emacs config, with Emacs 29.1
 I have successfully enabled treesitter for typescript/tsx, javascript, and rust, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my treesitter config...
 Switching from go-mode to go-ts-mode drops syntax higlighting, but all of the other aspects of treesit mode, like treesit-explore-mode work. Interestingly, nil is highlighted in my .go files, but nothing else is.
 I know that typescript/tsx have a known bug that requires downgrading to a specific version, but I don&#x27;t know how anyone discovered that bug so that I can replicate and perhaps downgrade go as well.
 I&#x27;m pretty new to emacs, and have only really started scratching the surface of how to customize it to my liking, so tips on how to debug would also be super helpful!
 treesit config:
 (setq treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;((go &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go&quot;) (gomod &quot;https://github.com/camdencheek/tree-sitter-go-mod&quot;))) (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4) 
 maybe relevant go config?:
 (setq lsp-go-use-gofumpt t) (eval-after-load &#x27;flycheck &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;flycheck-mode-hook #&#x27;flycheck-golangci-lint-setup)) (add-hook! &#x27;go-mode-hook (which-function-mode 1) (flycheck-select-checker &#x27;golangci-lint) (add-hook! &#x27;before-save-hook #&#x27;lsp-format-buffer t t) (add-hook! &#x27;before-save-hook #&#x27;lsp-organize-imports t t)) 
 Let me know if there&#x27;s anything else I can include that might be screwing with treesitter :)

 https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi
 On my phone, I use Google Keep as a thoughtdump.. (for example: when im commuting and remembered about something important, i open my phone, click on the Gkeep widget, write stuff down, then turn off my phone)
 basically all the tasks and ideas that come to me are written down there. I also use google keep when im using the school computer and want to pass or receive information through my google account. I want to know if it&#x27;s possible for me to integrate this api to my emacs to improve my workflow. im not yet knowledgeable in cs to understand how APIs work :(

                              <span>I swear to god, it can&#x27;t be that hard. But apparently i&#x27;m to stupid for this.
 What i want is, to use ansible-language-server in yaml files and have ansible-lint hints, but no automatic formating. I&#x27;m trying to make this work with lsp-mode or eglot. I prefer lsp-mode for the breadcrumbs and how it&#x27;s configured, but if i get what i want out of eglot, that&#x27;s fine too.
 First of all, i remap yaml to yaml-ts-mode
 (use-package yaml-mode :mode (&quot;\\.yml\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9][0-9][0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9][0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) ) 
 The lsp-mode setup i tried looks like this at the moment:
 (use-package ansible :hook (yaml-ts-mode . ansible)) (use-package lsp-mode :custom (lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (lsp-yaml-server-command &#x27;(&quot;ansible-language-s…</span>

 As you can see before I ran emacsclient there was already existing emacs frame. According to the help:  -r, --reuse-frame Create a new frame if none exists, otherwise use the current Emacs frame 
 What am I doing wrong? Why emacsclient cannot reuse the frame?

                              <span>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know why only now, after years of using Emacs, I have realized that I have never attempted to figure this out, in many regards, quite important feature of any text editor.
 I want to find a good, predictable way to jump between places. Not just within a single buffer or same window - between windows, tabs and frames. 
 So this is what I want:
  
I would be typing something in one buffer (matter of fact I&#x27;m typing this very message in an Emacs buffer), let&#x27;s call it t1/w1/b1, okay?
 
Then I would move the cursor to the top of the buffer, to fix a mistake.
 
Then for whatever reason I would switch to another window, right next to my current window&amp;buffer - let&#x27;s call it t1/w2/b2, and then type some other stuff.
 
Then, I would switch to another tab (I&#x27;m using tab-bar-mode) where it finds t2/w1/b1
 
 Now, is there a way to:
  
Pressing a key to jump to the previous tab, window, and buffer? So in my case pressing the key would take me first to t1/w2/b2, pressing it again to t1/w1/b1 at the top of b1, and then if I press again - to the end of it.
 
Seeing and using the jumps history in the minibuffer.
 
 Is there a good package that works this way? Emacs has powerful position system, how is something like this is not a thing? Or maybe I just don&#x27;t know about it yet? 
 Doom Emacs uses better-jumper, but it works within a single window or buffer, it can&#x27;t take you across different windows, tabs and frames. And because of that, it feels super unpredictable, I never know where better-jumper-jump-backward would take me next.
 There are Evil marks and built-in Emacs markers, but they also don&#x27;t seem to have cross-window-tab-frame functionality.
 What is you recommendation for this problem?

This post might seem unnecessary to alot of u and i agree but when u experience the pain of many years of terrible docs for different technologies u truly learn to appreciate this stuff.

                              <span>TL;DR: any quick and dirty way to say… convert this org buffer with eMacs faces into the html equivalent? (In terms of look). I’m tempted to just share screenshots but would lose links and people would think me mad.
 —-
 I’m exporting to html because I’ve failed at setting up pdf export on my Mac. I use code blocks to get something like a breakout text block… but all white space seems to get eaten and it just gets very “wall of text”. And the text blocks are full screen/scale but the text wraps at my eMacs width. 
 Can I get it to just export a look like the eMacs faces? Italics get broken in quote boxes. Newlines without an extra line get wrapped into a wall. Etc etc, I’m sure we’re all familiar with this. 
 I eventually want to learn how to format correctly and get it all working… but I don’t want to delay sharing my doc for the week that will probably take me to figure out. ;)
 Any pro tips appreciated. Is html just the wrong way and I need to bite the LaTex bullet? It was crazy how funky it seemed to be to get it going. 
 Thanks.

 I thought everything somehow fixed itself.. but it started happening again. 
 This time however, I was able to get some crash logs and it looks like it is related to corfu?

                              <span>Hey Emacs fellows,
 It is my first post here, and i want to introduce the devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge project! This feature brings auto-completion to your Emacs setup within development containers, using the powerful lsp-bridge.
 What is it?
 The devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge automates the setup of language servers supported by lsp-bridge inside your devcontainers. By using Nix packages, it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier than ever to get started with Emacs and language servers in a containerized development environment.
 Key Features:
  
Auto-completion in devcontainer
 Support for multiple languages
  
Check out the repository for more details.

                              <span>I keep noticing that some Emacs users seem to not be familiar with keyboard macros, and even those that are familiar with them aren&#x27;t always familiar with the fact that there&#x27;s a counter facility associated with them so you can do things like giving every #define in a block of C code a distinct associated value or what have you in a few keystrokes.
 Multiple cursors are sometimes the right tool, but some of the things people do with them are probably better done with keyboard macros. If you don&#x27;t know about them, you should.

                              <span>Using straight.el I installed the newest version of org-mode from the tecosaur repo and I also installed pdf-tools. Whenever I tried viewing a pdf for the first time, I would get a void variable error for org-format-latex-header. Even though this is declared as an obsolte variable in org-compat.el, its replacement is not defined at the time the pdf is opened. I am not sure what is the canonical way to solve this. Should I just (require &#x27;org-latex-preview) in my init.el or is there a cleaner approach like passing some parameter to use-package?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I&#x27;ve going around my head and investigating as for a way to finally implement all my email setup in Emacs, which is:
  
3 Gmail accounts that I can implement with .authinfo and application passwords
 
2 Gmail account that I can&#x27;t
 
1 Microsoft Exchange account where I can&#x27;t use app passwords and, when configuring davmail, I needed authorization (actually asking for it)
 
 My problem is the latter two, where in case I got lucky and manage to fight my case and get my app password in the Exchange one, I would still will be unable to use the 2 Gmail accounts that don&#x27;t have application passwords activated.
 I could configure Davmail for exchange, now, not sure about the other two gmail accounts... I think davmail only works for Microsoft.
 Is there, perhaps something like davmail that I can use across all of my accounts?, since application passwords aren&#x27;t considered secure, in the case these are eliminated, I wouldn&#x27;t want my accounts to stop working...
 How complicated would be to implement this? (elisp developer), is there perhaps a protocol that is not implemented in Emacs?, something like ouath2 which I think has a package. How technically complicated is this and, how much would it take?. Or is there perhaps, a different more updated way that I don&#x27;t know of?.

                              <span>Running EMACS 29.3, I get the messaage package cl is deprecated on start (been going on for a while--it was deprecated in 28 or 27, IIRC). I believe this is associated with the [simplenote2](https://github.com/alpha22jp/simplenote2.el) package. I use one of it&#x27;s functions (creating a note), I get the message format: Symbol’s function definition is void: math-fixnum. If I create a note on the browser, I can edit it in EMACS to my heart&#x27;s content. I just can&#x27;t make a new one. 
 My suspicion, as I said, is it&#x27;s related to the cl package. I was going to try to dig into the code to see if there is a fix, but I wanted to ask before digging into that: is there some standard fix/best practice/shim that can be applied to fix this?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 My talk &quot;Functional Programming: Failed Successfully&quot; from LambdaConf 2024 is now published online.
 This is my attempt to understand why functional languages are not popular despite their excellence. The talk&#x27;s other title is &quot;Haskell Superiority Paradox.&quot;
 Beware, the talk is spicy and, I hope, thought-provoking.
 I&#x27;ll be happy to have a productive discussion on the subject!

 Are there any tools or resources that can help me get really good at it? Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for MOOCs or courses similar to the ones from the University of Helsinki. Any recommendations for the best ways to learn and master Scala would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is a report on the ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK and why I&#x27;m here:
The difference between who I am now and who I was five years ago is largely due to how I&#x27;ve spent my time along the way.

How does my note-taking tie into my writing? More intimately, how do ideas get into my thinking? They do so in two ways: fast and slow. The adage, &quot;Nothi…</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t fully use all parts of a zettelkasten but I am trying to get better at making my notes atomic. This was one of the first notes I ever wrote but the more i learn about zettelkasten the more I think that this is more of a mini-essay. I think many of my notes are more of mini-essays rather than individual zettels. If so, how would I turn this into individual zettels? How do I know how far to break something down and when does it get too much? Sometimes I feel like every sentence could be turned into a zettel.
Side note: I use links instead of tags for categorization - not sure if I love this method but it&#x27;s whats been working for a bit.

                              <span>Ok, fun question I have to ask. With the availability of far more powerful free and open source NLP models, has any attempt been made to either replace (don&#x27;t think there are any models that are GPL freindly, yet) or supplement Eliza on emacs (a.k.a M-x doctor)?

                              <span>I work on a lot of parallel features in the same very large git repo, so I&#x27;ve been making use of git worktrees and treating each worktree as a separate projectile project. Usually the worktree is named ~/reponame/feature_im_working_on. 
 However, because the repo is so big, and because the build cache takes so long to initialize, I don&#x27;t want to create a new worktree every time I start a new feature. mv&#x27;ing the worktree unfortunately breaks the build cache, for reasons of stupid build system that&#x27;s out of my control. What I&#x27;d really like to do is have ~/reponame.real/a ~/reponame.real/b ... and symlink those to ~/reponame/my_feature. But projectile and project.el notice that its a symlink and name the project ~/reponame.real/a. I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to prevent this behavior, and just use the symlink as the project name, and I haven&#x27;t found it. Has anyone else done something like this with their workflow? Or do I need to hack the project.el source and add this?

                              <span>I started using Eshell a few months ago and by and large I like it. I really like having eat-eshell-mode enabled, which means if the command I run wants to be interactive, I get a terminal emulator right there! So seamless! So nice!
 One area I wish could be smarter is completions. I use corfu and cape; I would love it if Eshell were super smart about completing commands, sub-commands (like with git), control flags, etc. I have some configuration around this, but I&#x27;m not happy with it.
 How do you configure Eshell and your completion-at-point mechanisms to be as smart as possible?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am trying to establish a LaTeX workflow, and ideally would like to use pdf-tools (or something similar) because well, everything works that way all within emacs. However, the rendered pdf doesn&#x27;t feel quite snappy and fast as a standard pdf viewer like Zathura or even firefox&#x27;s pdf viewer.
 Is this a known issue with pdf-tools, or is there something that I would have to change in the config to make it work seamlessly with emacs and auctex?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been away from emacs for a while but am helping a user get access to a package archive (melpa) and the only way out is through an authenticating proxy. I found a discussion on stackoverflow suggesting a config like this: (setq url-proxy-services &#x27;((&quot;no_proxy&quot; . &quot;\(localhost\|10.*\)&quot;) (&quot;http&quot; . &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot;) (&quot;https&quot; . &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot;)))
 (setq url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage (list (list &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot; (cons &quot;Input your LDAP UID !&quot; (base64-encode-string &quot;LOGIN:PASSWORD&quot;))))) 
 (I can find similar examples elsewhere also)
 ... the url-proxy-services seems to work, as I can see the request hit the proxy. But the url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage seems to not work, as the proxy logs include a DENY with &quot;Authentication required&quot;, and when I look at the traffic with the request to the proxy, it doesn&#x27;t include any authentication.
 Has anyone had any success getting this working? It&#x27;s emacs 27.2 on OpenSuSE.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi. I am using borg for package management for my Emacs config. I&#x27;ve been thinking about incorporating some TDD into my Emacs config. I want to try out Ecukes, but it doesn&#x27;t seem too compatible with Borg. Whenever I try to run &#x27;eask install-deps&#x27;, it gives the error &quot;Package not installable &#x27;ecukes&#x27;; make sure the package archive (source) is included&quot;. I managed to trace the error to the following function in eask in lisp/_prepare.el:
 (defun eask-package-installable-p (pkg) &quot;Return non-nil if package (PKG) is installable.&quot; (assq (eask-intern pkg) package-archive-contents)) 
 Since I use Borg, I don&#x27;t appear to be setting the variable package-archive-contents. What would be the right way to go about solving this issue?

                              <span>Consult has recently stopped displaying the register list when I use my keybinding for consult-register-load. The function still works if I remember the binding I tied to the register but I get this error if I wait for the mini buffer to populate and the preview to start.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) 
 Anybody have any ideas? I looked at the register.el file but I&#x27;m not good enough with elisp to do more than guess at what is causing the problem. I&#x27;ve included my consult settings from my init file in case I&#x27;m missing a setting. It worked for months without but I&#x27;ve recently begun pulling from the github to stay more up to date on my emacs packages. I don&#x27;t remember if this started after an update.

                              <span>Hi, I have some experience with Java Springboot &amp; wanted to improve on that. But my project got changed which has data pipelines work now. (Azure Databricks pipelines) Should I ask for release in the project? Or side by side prepare for interviews? I am in service based company &amp; fearing of going to bench. Please suggest.
 Thanks in advance.

 On the previous stream we got paging done in Scala.today and this week we&#x27;ll try to get the basic set of functionalities complete for prod deployment.
 If you have any questions, suggestions, complaints regarding Scala, Scala tooling, infra as code tool Besom, VirtusLab&#x27;s work on Scala and such, fire away in the chat, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer anything.

                              <span>I have a question regarding how to handle enums on a code that is deployed on different situations.
 Think of &quot;region/State&quot; field, they are of course fixed (at least in the short term) but different on each country. I can see two different ways to handle it:
  
Manually change the file with the enum, simple
 
Keep them on a database and use set to generate the code automatically, cam make people nervous with this self-modifying code thing
 
 What would be the preferred approach in Scala?
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a parser for user input in a text adventure game, and I would like it to operate on a list of words instead of a String. What is the easiest way to parse a [String]? I am having trouble figuring out, e.g., how to (1) run the parser, and (2) how to consume an individual String or a [String] from the input.
 More generally, what is the easiest way to use Parsec when the input is a list of a Token type instead of a list of Char?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finished reading Learn You a Haskell and I&#x27;m currently following a tutorial on monad transformers I found online. The exercise is implementing MaybeT.
 The author makes MaybeT an instance of MonadTrans as follows:
 instance MonadTrans MaybeT where lift &#x3D; MaybeT . (liftM Just) 
 I&#x27;m a little confused initially, so I open my code editor and get the type annotation for lift, which makes it clear instantly: it takes a value in the base monad to produce a value in the transformed monad, with that same base and Maybe as a precursor.
 So I implement it on my own:
 lift :: (Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; m a -&gt; MaybeT m a lift x &#x3D; MaybeT $ do x&#x27;  x 
 And then the thought occurs to me that lift could be implemented generally, like so:
 lift x &#x3D; MonadT $ do return  x 
 But then the author asks, as an exercise: why is it that the lift function has to be defined separately for each monad, whereas liftM can be defined in a universal way?
 So I know I must&#x27;ve gotten something wrong somewhere here; but where exactly? Is it that using return makes sense in the context of Maybe, but it doesn&#x27;t in some other monad?

                              <span>I am a complete newbie to emacs/doom emacs. Trying to migrate from vim and build a org mode note taking workflow.
 These auto suggestions/completions are very annoying. I don&#x27;t understand emacs enough (yet). How would I disable these? In the future, how could I go about looking for help about visual elements like this from within emacs?
 Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/8V8MOs7
 Edit for more info:
 I did think it was coming from the company package so I have it commented out and still the completions continue to show. Here&#x27;s my init.el snippet: https://imgur.com/CmKvnD0, and here&#x27;s the output of M-x describe-mode which shows that company is active: https://imgur.com/a/m1c407M (this is after doom sync, full restart of emacs)
 Apparently M-x company-mode toggles it and then the suggestions go away, but that only seems like a local change. Could you help me understand what is happening?

 Hello, I recently wanted to try emacs, last night it worked great, but today I got the blue screen out of nowhere and when I wanted to open emacs again I got that, should I reinstall it or what is the problem? By the way, I&#x27;m super new, beyond reading the documentation they recommend

                              <span>The math symbols are (way) smaller than the default font.
 Recently, I&#x27;ve been fighting with org-pretty-entities to customize some behaviors. My latest endeavor is &quot;why the UTF-8 character for math symbol are so small compared to the default font?&quot;. FYI, this happens in org-mode and LaTeX-mode.
 When looking into the characters itself, some clues I&#x27;ve gathered:
  
the faces applied are font-latex-math-face and font-latex-sedate-face. Unfortunately, changing the height in any of those cause other parts to be comically large (math-face is also applied to the rest of the math block, sedate-face is applied to any latex command like \underbar).
 
the font used to display those characters is mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 despite my default supporting it (both mono and variable pitch are nerd font).
 
 Right now I am mostly suspecting the issue is the font that is being applied, but I am not sure how to fix it. Even when using (set-face-attribute &#x27;font-latex-math-face nil :family &quot;NotoSans Nerd Font&quot;), it keeps using the aforementioned font.
 Actually, the describe-char gives me the following info (some kinda of character composition? Not really that expert in Emacs):
 display: composed to form &quot;\alpha&quot; (see below) Composed with the following character(s) &quot;alpha&quot; by the rule: (?α) The component character(s) are displayed by these fonts (glyph codes): α: mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xA1E) 
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I see a lot of modes for programming languages. &quot;rust-mode&quot; &quot;python-mode&quot; &quot;this-mode&quot; &quot;that-mode&quot; and I don&#x27;t really understand why I would need them and how I could setup my dev environment without them.
 I like to keep my non built-in package count very, very, lean. I understand that there are probably some practical benefits to using these programming language specific modes but I just don&#x27;t like the idea of picking a package for every programming language, learning all the complexities of each of them, and using LSP, and using tree-sitter. It just seems like a lot.
 I also don&#x27;t know how to autmatically enable LSP and tree-sitter when editing certain file types without hooking into these modes.
 I&#x27;m very new and just looking for some Emacs wisdom. Thank you.

 FWIW I&#x27;m using emacs-plus on mac, but this seems to be noticed by others too. E.g. https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-06/msg00012.html
 Applause to our devs who support such amazing software on their free time!

 Regardless of whether or not your workflow extends to mobile, what&#x27;s your favourite Emacs package for spaced repetition?
 Currently playing with org-drill and anki-editor to get a feel for these too. Any other I should consider?

                              <span>Please skip this reading, it&#x27;s just a message about me and Emacs.
 I was ready to write a rant.
 Then I gave up and started to breathe and think.
 I&#x27;ve been an Emacs user for a couple of years and have learned a lot but I&#x27;m still pretty dissatisfied.
 But dissatisfied with what? Not about Emacs. Not about the packages I use. The truth is that I&#x27;m dissatisfied with myself using Emacs, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy, that&#x27;s the sad truth. Emacs is not for lazy people like me. Emacs is a demanding teacher. It requires you to be focused, focused and disciplined. So I decided to completely change my approach. I stopped compulsively trying any piece of package I found on Reddit. I decided to read and study Lisp, starting from the basics, the commands and the basic architecture.
 My frustration is driven by my ignorance. Above all.
 Emacs isn&#x27;t for me when I think I can find a baked solution on satckoverflow.
 Emacs is not for me if I expect to have every package well documented in detail.
 Emacs isn&#x27;t for me when I think one package can solve all my problems.
 Emacs is not for me if I think Emacs can organize chaos in my head.
 But I also found the main problem in Emacs: it causes dependency.
 Once you try it you can&#x27;t stop using it, you can&#x27;t stop thinking about it, you can&#x27;t stop trying to find new solutions. Learning Emacs must be done in an organized and programmatic manner.
 I&#x27;m not a developer, nor a programmer, I&#x27;m mostly an aspiring programmer (I use R and a little Python), but the way Emacs forces me to stay focused on what I&#x27;m doing, to organize my notes, my documents, my GTD is something new and somehow irreplaceable.
 Thank you all. Thanks Emacs. And sorry for the unnecessary message.

                              <span>I have enabled pop in my gmail account and have the following in my .gnus:
 (setq gnus-select-method &#x27;(nnnil &quot;&quot;)) ;; Define how Gnus is to read your mail. We read mail from ;; your ISP’s POP server. (setq mail-sources &#x27;((pop :server &quot;pop.gmail.com&quot; :port 995 :user &quot;my@mail.com :stream ssl))))) ;; Say how Gnus is to store the mail. We use nnml groups. (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods &#x27;((nnml &quot;&quot;))) 
 When I launch gnus, I am prompted for my password, and then dumped into an empty buffer with a minibuffer message saying &quot;no news is good news&quot;. I get the same behavior using the wrong password too, so I am not even sure if it is trying to connect to the server. Those options in my mail-sources are what is given to me by Gmail when I look into their &quot;Configuring your email client&quot; instructions. How do I debug this?

                              <span>I enjoy the code-writing experience Emacs and the community provides. But this is the 8th year since I joined the party and I still feel overwhelmed. Usually when I write code, random &quot;problems&quot; still show up here and there, even I have &quot;solved&quot; a lot in the past.
 By &quot;problem&quot;, I mean issues, warnings, behaviors that don&#x27;t work the way I like, configurations I have to choose and balance, even functionalities I used to know but forget their shortcuts, function names or triggers.
 If I ignore those &quot;problems&quot;, they will just stay there and continue to popup every now and then until I upgrade the whole packages and hoping those problems get automatically solved.
 If I solve them, it usually take some time which will interrupt my normal workflow. This is annoying.
 There are two solutions I can think of:
  
Either &quot;problems&quot; get fewer as time goes (which is usually not the case). or
 I get control over Emacs and can solve every &quot;problem&quot; really quickly.
  
In terms of option 2, what can I do? Should I
  
get better at common lisp?
 read more packages&#x27; source code?
 remember more built-in elisp functions?
 write a package from start?
 just spare a fixed amount of time fixing Emacs problem every day?
  
What&#x27;s your experience and solution? What&#x27;s your advice to people like me?

 I&#x27;m using doom emacs btw if that&#x27;s important

                              <span>I have been an Evil user for a while, but I am playing around with meow and it seems extremely interesting. However, there are a couple of Evil&#x27;s functionalities that are essential to me, and I could not find an obvious equivalents in meow. These are:
  
Jump lists (C-oand C-ishortcuts in Evil)
 Jump to definition
  
I am wondering if you guys have any insight on how to get such functionalities in meow.

                              <span>I have corfu and cape installed, but this only gives me some very basic completions. I would like, for instance, to have type info (whether a completion is a function, variable, or macro, etc), or for the ui to only suggest valid completions (not variables out of scope), some linting would be nice too where it indicates potential problems. Essentially, i am looking for an lsp experience for elisp

                              <span>In lsp-mode (or any other Emacs cases), I can use lsp-rename to rename a var/id, all references being updated automatically. Now I want to modify a function&#x27;s signature, e.g. adding an argument, in a way similar lsp-rename. Anyone knows how to to that, thanks.

                              <span>I have been using Obsidian / VSCode for many years now, but wanted to &#x27;get the hang of&#x27; Emacs to see why it is regarded as the most efficient way to manage code/info. The last time I used Emacs was in the 90&#x27;s but I don&#x27;t recall it being extra special at the time. (I probably wasn&#x27;t looking at all the features though)
 I am feeling good about Emacs now - I find myself working pretty easily with it, and am finally getting the hang of some of the shortcuts (it was really difficult at the start to not C V )
 CSV editing is great - columns can be aligned easily
 Dired mode is the real bonus - apart from the initial oddness of clicking a folder and having it open in the next buffer, I am now loving it. It is really quick to jump around and edit multiple files, and the directory list itself is great to copy quickly from (making a lot of tiny CSV files). The marking of files via regexp is fantastic, and there are so many little things that make working just that bit easier.
 So, I have uninstalled VSCode and am using Emacs full time for coding now (still using Obsidian - the markdown links are a bit borked so I need to do some scripting to convert them so they work nicely)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just getting started with learning emacs and I&#x27;ve been watching some of SystemCrafters to start building my config to understand this software better. 
 I installed the GUI version on windows 10 and one thing I have trouble figuring out is how to make the cursor position visible as in the lower part of this image which is taken from a screenshot of &quot;Emacs from Scratch&quot; 
 I would like to have something similar so I can find my position in the buffer. Unless I type something I do not know where in the line my cursor is (as in the upper part of the image)
 So far I only managed to set the hl-line-mode on so I can at least find the line I&#x27;m in, but several things I tried to put in my config that I found in various forums led me to believe that I perhaps do not know the correct terminology for this setting.
 I tried
 (setq-default cursor-type block) 
 and 
 (setq make-pointer-invisible nil) 
 and tried changing the cursor color, but it didn&#x27;t make it visible. 
 Any help would be appreciated, I&#x27;m sorry for asking such a basic question but I could not figure it out with googling it.

 Coming from a vim background, it is pretty straightforward to specify text wrapping of certain number of characters for specific filetypes. Is there a way to achieve this in emacs?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have released version 0.6.0 of Kele, the spritzy Kubernetes management package for Emacs. Changelog here.
 Note: This release bumps the minimum required version of Emacs to 29.
 This release introduces the notion of kind-specific keybindings. Some resources have special &quot;actions&quot; associated with them, e.g. &quot;restarting&quot; Deployments or getting logs from Pods. kele-resource now has a dedicated column for these keybindings that, when defined, are dynamically filled in based on the selected resource kind. For now, there is only one resource-specific keybinding—R to restart a Deployment. Try s-k deployments to check it out.

 In addition, individual bindings within kele-resource are disabled based on your permissions for the given context/cluster. In other words, if you don&#x27;t have permission to list Pods within the selected cluster, Kele will disable the l keybinding with a helpful message.

 Lastly, this release fleshes out the resource listing functionality. Some highlights:
  
In addition to opening a resource from the list view (RET), you can now also delete/kill the resource at point with k;
 The list view now shows the owner resource(s) for every list item; hitting RET with your cursor over the owner cell will instead open the owning resource;
 The list view now supports listing across all namespaces.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you&#x27;d like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Enjoy!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve noticed that recording a macro when having a special input-method enabled (say TeX) and using isearch, the macro is terminated by ringing of the bell. I&#x27;ve found that one of the functions called is isearch-with-input-method (isearch-x.el), and it calls exit-minibuffer; commenting out that call, even though some things behave funny, at least doesn&#x27;t terminate the macro. It also works if I disable the input-method temporarily, then use isearch, and simply turn it back on if I have to input something specific to the input-method; that however rules out any searching for special characters, which isn&#x27;t ideal at all. Is there a way to remedy this? It seems strange to me that one shouldn&#x27;t be able to record a macro simply due to using an input method... Help greatly appreciated! I&#x27;m using Emacs 30 from homebrew-emacs-plus.

                              <span>I have been watching tsoding (btw reallly recommend his channel if you’re into software engineering) and I came across some manipulation he did with emacs. See the clipped video. I have been trying to search about how to do it. Does anybody know? Also, I have been trying to learn how to « learn » more effectively. This is a perfect example of something I see is possible but I don’t know how to search emacs docs for it. Would you mind sharing your usual flow of search?
 Thanks people and have a nice week end !

                              <span>I was reading that doom emacs is easier to get into that vanilla emacs for vim users, so I went through the installation and everything looks good with doom doctor. 
 But, when I start up emacs, it doesn&#x27;t seem like evil-mode works at all!
 If doom emacs is installed correctly, should evil-mode be working when I start up emacs? Are there commands I can run inside of emacs to check if evil-mode is installed and enabled?

I am facing the following problem: I have a structure note on Financial Reporting, and I am trying to find an efficient way to display all the contents of the links of that structure note in a single document. I currently do that by manually opening notes and copy pasting their title and contents in the end of the file. I would really appreciate that if someone could point me to a less-manual way of doing that!</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve long lurked this forum and related spaces, but I thought I&#x27;d join the discussions from here on out.
I am an early stage PhD student for computer science.
I&#x27;ve been using a Zettelkasten-esq system in Typst (a LaTeX alternative) to keep track of my research, coursework, and a few serious hobbies.
My current in-Zettelkasten obsessions include disparate but I-swear-they-make-sense-in-my-head subjects such as:
Vector databases and sparse graphs
Package queries and user defined functions
Matroid theory
Theory of order statistics
Whatever is going on in that feud between invasive biologists and conservation biologists
Early 20th-century Christian socialism
I am a little bit of a bat who is just passable enough at seemingly unrelated topic in databases and mathematics to eek out some papers. As a professor told me, it&#x27;s easier to be first than to be the best. And, if you&#x27;re not cut out for pure mathematics, just get into applied-applied-applied mathematics of computer systems!
My current Zettelkasten iteration is a bit weird; if it matures and stands the test of time, I may divulge further. Its main principle is to help me keep on chugging along and do some real work.</span>

                              <span>I am exposing my thinking to public scrutiny as a way of probing the universe, seeking wisdom, and improving my thoughts. Writing ideas in the form of notes is an essential act, and hugely impacts my thinking. For example, I spent the morning writing this little diatribe. In the process, my thinking improved, but I still have a long way to go. Knowledge emerges through continuous stress testing of ideas, mostly through writing.

In knowledge work, the Pareto Principle suggests that 20% of the activities contribute to 80% of the achievement, making it especially pertinent in knowledge management.
Initially, whether we are zealous explorers or hesitated, confused overthinkers, the one activity that provides the most value is the habit of routinely writing notes, which are proxies for ou…</span>

 in the code above I am trying to connect to an sqlite database using doobie and retreive the data from a table
 the table is &quot;create table person (ID integer primary key autoincrement, nameperson text, birth DATE not null);&quot;
 but when I try to execute I get an error Caused by: java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: &quot;1997-08-03&quot; does not match (\p{Nd}++)\Q-\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q-\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q \E(\p{Nd}++)\Q:\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q:\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q.\E(\p{Nd}++)
 note: if I remove the date field it works perfectly and the data is retrieved successfully
 how to retrieve a Date column and parse it correctly

                              <span>This isn&#x27;t Scala specific, but I thought it would be a good place to ask.
 I&#x27;m working on forming my thoughts on error handling, and I&#x27;m looking for any existing writing that I should be aware of. Specifically I&#x27;m looking for anything that compares and contrasts control flow driven (ie. exceptions) and data driven (unions, tuples, monads of various flavors, etc.) error handling.
 Other free food for thought: It seems like as of 2.13 the Scala ecosystem had pretty well settled into data driven error handling of various flavors. With Scala 3 there are new options on the horizon for control flow based error handling. Interestingly things like boundary break syntax for error handling in ox looks very much like monadless syntax, but works totally different under the hood.
 disclaimer: when I say control flow driven error handling, I don&#x27;t mean the anti-pattern of intentionally using exceptions for control flow

I have reached out to my lecturer for help with the task but to no avail, no support or help was provided. The task that was assigned to me was to write down 10 classes in which the classes should cover:
 1) The characteristic of the class
 2) Behaviour- without actual implementation
 Can a kind soul please help me check and guide me on any errors I may have made? Perhaps, some classes I should swap out?

                              <span>long time nvim user, heard about orgmode recently and it sparked my interest, haven&#x27;t tinkered much with it or emacs yet.
 For now i have doom emacs setup basically, and I wanted to know how much emacs would I need to know to be able to take advantage of orgmode, planning on using it for daily notes, todos, calendars and technical writeups.
 Im currently pretty happy with my nvim setup for development so not rlly planning on going down the emacs rabbit hole, I just wanna make the most out of orgmode with doom, just wanna be productive enough with it if that makes sense, Im willing to put in the work for this purpose.

                              <span>There are so many different packages that I think are related to completion and I am not sure how everything fits in. I have seen counsel+ivy+swiper, helm, and consult+orderless+marginalia+vertico+embark, and then there is corfu+cape. Are these bundles interchangeable, do they do entirely different things?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a projectile project in Emacs but for the life of me can&#x27;t get it to recognize my simple folder as a project. I&#x27;ve done all of the below to no avail:
  
Created the project folder.
 Created a python file in it (.py)
 Initialized a git repository in it and committed the above file: git init; git add .; git commit
 Added an empty &quot;.projectile&quot; file in the folder
 Made sure my projectile-project-search-path is set to &quot;~/&quot;
 Ran projectile-discover-projects-in-search-path and verified that it was able to discover other projects
 Ran projectile-add-known-project and selected the folder
  
Up to step 6, it doesn&#x27;t discover the folder as a project. When I do step 7, it seems to add the project folder to the list of projects, but when I try to switch to it, it complains that the directory is not a project, and then removes it from the list.
 Here&#x27;s the directory after I create it:
 project/
 ├── .git
 ├── .projectile
 └── script.py
 What do I have to do?!!!!

                              <span>When writing elisp code and looking for a function that would do something you need, what do you use to find it, inside Emacs only (no web search)?
 Emacs has a lot of built-in documentation; it has
  
a help system,
 an info system,
 Apropos
 all code has docstrings,
 for other outside help, it has an excellent support for the man pages with: 
 man and woman
 
  
On top of that you can install other complementary packages that add more help search features such as:
  
helpful (which is excellent)
  
There&#x27;s a lot of commands available with the C-h or  key prefix and lots that are not bound by default.
 I documented the ones I know and created some others in my system in this PDF: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/help.pdf
 Despite all of that, every so often, I stumble to find the name of a function that I know exists but can&#x27;t remember the name. The other day I was looking for the predicate function that tells whether point was at the beginning of line; bolp.
  
I tried typing beginning and using C-M-i to complete it. That did not work.
 I typed C-u C-h d for apropos-documentation and got a long list of suggestions from which I searched for &quot;beginning .? line&quot; with some regexp and finally I found bolp at line 7833 of the Apropos buffer.
  
I eventually found it, but it took longer than I like. And was very tempted to search the internet or depend on a connection to the outside world (eg, IA). But there must be a better way to quickly find functions in Emacs.
 How do *you\* quickly find the functions you need *inside Emacs*?

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best way to sync installed package versions between different computers?
 I have been using use-package with :ensure t for a long time (with the default package.el as the backend). But I&#x27;ve read posts from experienced Emacs users suggesting to not do this. Instead, they recommend using package-install manually and then check ~/.emacs.d/elpa into their dotfiles repo, so that you sync the exact set of installed packages between computers. This is supposed to make the config more reproducible, since after a git pull every computer will have the same &quot;Emacs state&quot;.
 This idea appeals to me, especially since I&#x27;ve noticed that (i) sometimes my config doesn&#x27;t bootstrap correctly on new computers, (ii) sometimes package upgrades break my setup and I want an easy way to roll everything back when I need to just get work done, and (iii) I&#x27;ve started relying more on GitHub packages (via package-vc-install-from-checkout) and would like to avoid having to repeat this on new hosts.
 Some more concrete questions for those who follow this approach:
  
If you sync your installed packages in this way, what exactly do you sync (i.e. what&#x27;s your &#x60;.gitignore&#x60;)? 
 I guess you *should* sync the &#x60;*.el&#x60; files, otherwise there&#x27;s not much point.
 I guess you *shouldn&#x27;t* sync the natively compiled {&#x60;*.eln&#x60;, &#x60;*.so&#x60;, &#x60;*.dylib&#x60;} files.
 But what about the byte compiled &#x60;*.elc&#x60; files? Are these portable across different operating systems, different processor architectures, different Emacs ports, and different Emacs major versions?
 
 After syncing, do you need to do anything special to make things work? 
 For example, is &#x60;package-recompile-all&#x60; required?
 
  
Or is all this a fools errand, and I should instead switch tox e.g. elpaca, straight, etc.? Since I left Spacemacs and Doom Emacs some years ago, I&#x27;ve mostly stuck to the default package.el when I use Emacs (I regularly use Vim as well). But I am open to other tools if they make my life significantly easier.

If I type P -F quickly, the -F isnt picked up by magit. Is that a feature or just slowness?
 EDIT: Delay actually kicks in after typing the &quot;-&quot;, which immediately updates available actions. The minibuffer then takes about a second to show &quot;--&quot; and then I can type F.

 For now i have doom emacs setup basically, and I wanted to know how much emacs would I need to know to be able to take advantage of orgmode, planning on using it for daily notes, todos, calendars and technical writeups.
 Im currently pretty happy with my nvim setup for development so not rlly planning on going down the emacs rabbit hole, I just wanna make the most out of orgmode with doom, just wanna be productive enough with it if that makes sense, Im willing to put in the work for this purpose.

                              <span>I was trying to use replace-string to remove the underline-creating underscore prefix/suffix pairs at various points in an Org document. But neither it, nor any of the related replace/search commands appear to be able to find them. This only happens in this pairing scenario, where there&#x27;s an underscore both at the start of the first word in a sequence, and at the end of the last word. Otherwise the underscore is found by search as it should be.
 Can anyone explain what causes that?
 FWIW, the replace/search fails regardless of whether I havecase-fold-search defaulting to t or to nil (although that does affect what message I get when the replace/search fails).
 ADDED: I&#x27;ve just noticed that the same problem exists with all six of the formatting characters mentioned in the manual, viz.: *, /, _, &#x3D;, ~, and (if I must 🤓) + . I guess that should be a clue as to what the cause is, but I don&#x27;t see it yet.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently done some work where I wrote a parallel test loop for QuickCheck (QC). I did this in collaboration with Koen Claessen, Nicholas Smallbone, and Bo Joel Svensson.
 It is not merged in the QC repository yet, and it will take some time (it is a significant change). I must have implemented five different versions along the way, and what is there now is a mix of all of them. I am happy with the end result, but had to rush a bit in the end to reach a deadline. There is some wonky code lingering around my fork that will go away in due time.
 If you would like to try it out before it gets merged, I have written up some instructions in the link below. I have also included some of my results as well as links to both the code and paper :)

After getting things at least mostly right, I check other folks&#x27; submissions. Holy cow, there is some stunning elegance in how people in-the-know have handled some of those problems... Just wow.
 Too bad most comments and posts are in that 5-15 years ago range X-)

                              <span>Hello,
 Generally I have been enjoying reflex but this time I&#x27;ve stuck with what seems like a very simple feature for days! Hopefully someone can help.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a dynamic list of some value and a delay Dynamic t [(Text, NominalDiffTime)]
 I&#x27;ve been trying to end up with an Event t Text which would be an event stream that fires as many events as there were in the list with very limited success.
 This event stream should be triggered by another event Event t ().
 I&#x27;ve been trying something like
 haskell performEvent $ ffor theTriggerEvent $ \_ -&gt; do valuesAndDelays &lt;- sample . current $ valuesWithDelays ... construct the event stream 
 but the problem is that I can&#x27;t use delay inside Performable.
 I have a gut feeling this is some sort of a fold but I can&#x27;t wrap my head around it.

                              <span>I have been looking for a way to do this for a long time, but it seems really difficult.
 It is only possible to turn off a specific set of rules by recompiling the source files with those RULES pragma commented out? Then if want to turn off rules written in the base package, is it true that I will have to hack it and recompile the base package myself? Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi! Switched to emacs somewhat recently, and I use a long running daemon on a server, ssh into the server, and emacsclient into it. I use emacs as both an editor and also a &quot;runner&quot; i.e. all of my long running tasks run inside shell or vterm. I usually can find the shells that I need but, I&#x27;d like a way to group shells / text editors / direds together according to &quot;projects&quot; (and have the ability to switch to buffers/shells only within that project) In addition, I&#x27;d like these projects to be permanent and restore-able. I.e. I quit emacsclient, have projects open and associated buffers (shells and text). Then the next day I can reopen emacsclient and restore the same setup. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of ways to do this (projectile, project.el, perspectives, beframe, tabmode) but can&#x27;t seem to be able to find a setup that ticks all the boxes above. I&#x27;m also honestly a little overwhelmed by the choices here :D Thanks for any pointers!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am desperately trying to get doom emacs in terminal mode (emacs -nw) to have a transparent background. I have tried everything that I could think of and find as resources, but I can only get the emacs GUI to have the transparent background by following emacs wiki and setting in my doom emacs config.el:
 (set-frame-parameter nil &#x27;alpha-background 70) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(alpha-background . 70)) 
 My emacs version is emacs29-pgtk. I am using the kitty terminal and have already made the terminal itself transparent.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips on how to make this work, as I have tried for a long time and have no idea why this is not working.

                              <span>I recently saw a tweet featuring an upcoming improvement to Metals that would allow you to interact with code and use completion/navigation while the project is not in a compiling state.
 This is more challenging to do than it sounds, and I wrote a tiny blurb about the problem and the proposed solution.
 TL;DR The Scala team at VirtusLab is working hard on improving the experience of using Scala 3 with Metals, but I also believe this could greatly benefit IntelliJ IDEA as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had trouble understanding a couple of things around filtering results with a columnview dynamic block:
  
I couldn&#x27;t get the LABEL setting for :id to do what I expected.
 Same thing with the :match setting.
  
One cool trick--add a number of rows with a :noexport: tag and put the columnview dynamic block outside of them--made reporting a bit easier as a way to avoid including headings that aren&#x27;t necessary except as property containers.
 While the above&#x27;s mostly a complaint, I do have a constructive question: how can we get a cookbook of working examples that show uncommon usecases (e.g. using column view as a multi-line workaround for tables)?

                              <span>Writing modular code is a challenge any large project faces,
and that stands even more true for Python monoliths.
Python’s versatility is convenient, yet a very big gun to shoot one’s foot with.
If there’s one thing I’ve learnt over the years of building software,
it’s the importance of testing to mitigate risks and allow refactoring in the long run.
In my experience however, I’ve seen much less testing in projects than I would’ve liked.
If it can be rarely attributed to plain malevolence or stupidity,
the most recurrent reason is: it is hard and it takes too much time.
The issue is, it’s often true!
So how can we lower the barrier to make testing easier?

Function composition to the rescue

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to generate a traditional &quot;org chart&quot; (e.g. for a company) from an Org mode file.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried out org-mind-map† (via graphviz). It works, but the output is more DAG-like than the kind of thing you see with a standard organizational chart††. I know that org-mind-map-engine offers some control over the format, but none of the options match what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Does anyone know if I can get what I&#x27;m after out of org-mind-map?
 Or, if not, any other Org mode-based suggestions?
 Thanks!
  
† I&#x27;m using the-ted/org-mind-map via melpa, rather than the unpackaged fork at alphapapa/org-mind-map . That&#x27;s simply because although it&#x27;s a fork, the latter appears to be behind the former in commits. The forked code looks to be the unmodified v0.1 of the original, whereas the original is now at v0.4. But if anyone (e.g. u/github-alphapapa himself :-) ) thinks there&#x27;s more going on there, and that the fork actually is the one to use, let me know.
 †† For example, in the traditional org. chart, a parent node with multiple child nodes would connect to its children using a single line with branches off it to each child (and the parent). Something like this. By contrast, org-mind-map&#x27;s DAG-style has a separate line from the parent to child for each of the children.

                              <span>How can I skip certain heading levels in org clock tables? I&#x27;d like to skip certain &quot;boring&quot; headings from clock table reports.
 I organize my projects GTD style like this:
 * Sell My Home ** Purpose / Expected Outcome - Sell my home for a lot of money ** Project Reference - Asking price :: $100 - [[https://zillow.com][Zillow]] - [[https://realtor.com][Realtor]] ** Actions *** TODO Research Home Values :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 09:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 10:00] &#x3D;&gt; 0:00 :END: *** TODO Create Listing :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-06-05 Wed 10:00]--[2024-06-05 Wed 11:00] &#x3D;&gt; 0:00 :END: 
 I use clock tables like this:
 #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope file :maxlevel 4 :compact t :block today #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2024-06-05 Wed 11:06], for Wednesday, June 05, 2024. | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Actions | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | #+END: 
 I&#x27;d like to skip the &quot;Actions&quot; row, like this:
 | Headline | Time | |----------------------------+------| | *Total time* | *2:00* | |----------------------------+------| | Sell My Home | 2:00 | | \_ Research Home Values | 1:00 | | \_ Create Listing | 1:00 | 
 Is it possible to either exclude certain heading levels, or (better) exclude certain headings, but still include their children? For example, exclude &quot;** Actions&quot; but still include its children. I see there is a matchoption, but I&#x27;m looking for an exclude option, based on the header name.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m currently trying to generate MkDocs from my collection of org files, to have some sort of static documentation site based off my notes.
 My approach so far has been converting org to markdown with pandoc, to then feed all markdown files to mkdocs along with some custom css.
 This seemed quite straightforward, however I soon realised there are a few caveats: - pandoc org parsing is not 100% accurate and some elements are missing (e.g.: task priorities are not parsed to their own AST element) - mkdocs extends markdown with custom syntax, this md block for instance:  ??? Drawer Lorem Ipsum  will be rendered as a collapsible drawer in the resulting html. This led me to write some custom pandoc filters, for example to convert a :NOTES: org drawer to a ??? NOTES md block.
 In all fairness, it&#x27;s becoming a bit complex and there&#x27;s a lot of stuff I&#x27;m not covering yet.
 So the reason for this post is to ask you for guidance about what approach to use, I see 3 options: 1. continue with the current approach of using pandoc, adding more logic/filters when needed 2. use a different, more complete, org parser and then generate mkdocs-compatible markdown myself 3. write something entirely in Elisp, similarly to projects like ox-hugo.
 I&#x27;m a bit of an Elisp newbie, so I&#x27;m not sure how feasible it is for me to tackle option 3, other than that feel free to suggest other options.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spiked several pieces of functionality over about the last year, both for internal and user-facing work. Some features will be present in work I&#x27;m doing anyway. I am curious to get some early feedback before attempting to crystalize it.
 Fully specified, fully decideable schedules are appopriate when scopes and times are known. I can imagine people who have jobs that are relatively static find the features of vanilla org mode to be appropriate.
 However, for open-ended work, which is endemic to small companies in their high-growth and product development phase, these tools (and many, many others) fall down in a lot of ways. Most work is optional, even aspirational. The payoff of any piece or an ensemble of pieces is uncertain. The bandwidth is scarce and must be triaged. Managing is i…</span>

                              <span>I am considering to give haskell a go (again). I actually wanted to earlier but got discouraged by an (at that time) very clunky tooling experience, and I also found it annoying that I had to use pragma&#x27;s to for example enable exhaustive type checking (which imo always should be default). At the time I instead decided to dive into Purescript, which I have been enjoying quite a lot ever since. I have probably written somewhere around 10k lines of purescript by now. However, I feel that purescript is quite niche and has some annoying limits due to primarily running on node or in the browser. For example, I don&#x27;t see myself ever doing proper parallel processing in purescript. I also feel that purescript might be more limited in context of future job opportunities. These are the reasons for which I am considering to give learning Haskell a second try.
 Much learning material seems to be targeted at OOP programmers who are new to FP. I obviously don&#x27;t need the the whole FP sales pitch with my background. What I need is more something along the lines of &quot;I am comfortable with FP, monads, type classes and monad transformers, and now I want to learn Haskell without getting bored by the learning material&quot;.
 I have read the excellent purescript book called &quot;Functional programming made easier&quot; https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier. My background before Purescript has been working professionally with F# and Clojure for a few years.
 On the longer run I am considering to do some Haskell certification https://certification.serokell.io/

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs &amp; org for knowledge management, and I often need to search my notes. One of the ways I do this is with +default/org-notes-search (from search.el, maybe it&#x27;s a doom thing? It just wraps ripgrep on org-directory), which displays two windows; a list of results on the bottom and a preview of the currently selected result on the top window.
 I don&#x27;t hard-wrap my text files; I rely on visual-line-mode instead. This makes searching kind of annoying, because I can&#x27;t get the preview window (the top one) to wrap long lines. The closest I&#x27;ve been able to get is by doing this:
 &#x60;(add-hook &#x27;occur-mode-hook &#x27;visual-line-mode)&#x60;
 which sort of enables visual-line-mode in the preview window... but only sometimes, and only if I click in that window to focus its buffer. I can then go back down to the results and flip through results in the same file, but when I Get to the next file I have to refocus the results buffer again.
 Anyone have an idea of how I can get this to work seamlessly? Extra bonus points if I can enable visual-fill-column-mode too!

 I tried the modus themes but to modify an sql / C# / ... file is not enough good.
 What I used to use is vs-light theme what is good for coding but I&#x27;m very curious what you use for coding.

Does emacs has something similar? At least I haven&#x27;t found something close to two sites written above. If there is really no similar sites/list... May be this thing can be a good small project for someone, but why melpa and elpa don&#x27;t have this functionally yet...

                              <span>For those using the &#x60;linux&#x60; indentation style to code in the kernel space, how do you indent with a tab instead of 8 spaces?
 The following config still adds 8 spaces when I press Enter.
 (defun set-c-indentation () &quot;Indentation for C programming.&quot; (setq-default c-ts-mode-indent-style &#x27;linux c-ts-mode-indent-offset 8 tab-width 8 indent-tabs-mode t)) (add-hook &#x27;c-ts-mode-hook &#x27;set-c-indentation)

                              <span>help-enable-variable-value-editing is a variable defined in ‘help-fns.el’. Its value is t Original value was nil If non-nil, allow editing values in *Help* buffers. To edit the value of a variable, use C-h v to display a &quot;*Help*&quot; buffer, move point after the text &quot;Its value is&quot; and type e. Values that aren’t readable by the Emacs Lisp reader can’t be edited even if this option is enabled. This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in version 29.1 of Emacs. You can customize this variable. 
 I just tried this out, and wow, is it useful. I appear to have overlooked it, and I couldn&#x27;t find it mentioned on this sub yet, so...enjoy!

 We&#x27;ve got some interesting insights based on practical experience on Saturday that turned into proposals (with PRs) to Ox already:
 https://github.com/softwaremill/ox/issues/147
 https://github.com/softwaremill/ox/issues/149
 https://github.com/softwaremill/ox/issues/150
 If you have any questions, suggestions, complaints regarding Scala, Scala tooling, infra as code tool Besom, VirtusLab&#x27;s work on Scala and such, fire away in the chat, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer anything.

                              <span>Could you please recommend a scala library (or another jvm based or even .Net based library) that I can use to stress test an intranet web app that uses windows authentication (IIS web server)? 
 From my research gatling doesn&#x27;t support this type of authentication: https://community.gatling.io/t/i-want-to-use-the-ntlm-auth-is-it-possible-with-gatling-if-not-do-you-have-another-solution/7705/3.
 I am using jmeter at the moment but I find it a little bit painful. I would feel more comfortable to write code.

                              <span>I’m trying to config lua in emacs, currently i’m using the following:
 (use-package eldoc :init (global-eldoc-mode) :custom (eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p nil) (eldoc-documentation-strategy #&#x27;eldoc-documentation-default)) (use-package eglot :preface :hook ((lua-mode . eglot-ensure)) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;M-&quot; . eglot-code-actions)) :config ;; Please be faster (fset #&#x27;jsonrpc--log-event #&#x27;ignore) (setf (plist-get eglot-events-buffer-config :size) 0) :custom (completion-category-overrides &#x27;((eglot (styles orderless)) (eglot-capf (styles orderless)))) (eglot-sync-connect nil) (eglot-report-progress nil) (eglot-autoshutdown t) (eglot-extend-to-xref t)) (use-package lua-mode :ensure t :defer t :mode (&quot;\\.lua\\&#x27;&quot; . lua-mode) :interpreter (&quot;lua&quot; . lua-mode) :custom (lua-indent-level 4) (lua-indent-string-contents t)) 
 It&#x27;s working pretty well with the exception of the Eldoc documentation. When I hover over something, the documentation correctly shows in the minibuffer, but when I open the Eldoc buffer with eldoc-doc-buffer, the documentation is repeated multiple times.
 I tried debugging it and found out that if I remove eglot-signature-eldoc-function from eldoc-documentation-functions, I get only one item in the Eldoc buffer. However, I don&#x27;t know how to prevent Eldoc from adding this item and thus avoid the duplication in the Eldoc buffer.

                              <span>Is there a way to check if a key is being pressed? 
 I would like to have a function that keeps executing until the user presses a key. Something like this:
  (while (no-user-action) (do something) (sleep for a bit)) 
 Or do you know of a package that implements something like this?
 My use-case is the following: I have a video playing (web browser), and the subtitles in emacs. I can query the video for the timestamp and synchronize the subtitle to the video (moving the point to the current subtitle and potentially recentering the window).
 I want this to be done automatically until I press a key. At that point the synchronization stops.
 thank you for any help

                              <span>I have been experiencing random flickering on the pgtk build of emacs on wayland in the recent months since updating to nvidia-drivers version 535 from 525.
 I am building Emacs from source with pgtk enabled every week. And I am quite sure it is related to Nvidia because all the flickering goes away when I downgrade to nvidia-525. I am now on Nvidia 550 and the issue persists. 
 I have an RTX2060 with Gentoo.
 After some testing, I find that all OpenGL related applications especially with lower version of OpenGL like 3.x are having the same issue. I even wrote a bunch of SDL window to render simple textures to test that. All the others with vulkan does not have the same issue.
 I have messed around with Minecraft recently, and the launcher has an option of running OpenGL on Zinc, which is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. If I run Minecraft with Zinc enabled, the flickering is gone.
 I believe Emacs is using OpenGL to draw on screen. Is there any workaround for me to run Emacs&#x27; OpenGL call via Zinc? Or does anyone have similar experience that have found a solution?

                              <span>For the first time in years I upgraded Emacs to latest 29.3.50 and latest for all packages also. The first thing that broke was org-mode with the new default of tab-width &#x3D; 8 that will conflict with editorconfig but easily solved by adding a rule on your .editorconfig file for org-mode files.
 Now it looks like it is treesitter, when displaying C++ there&#x27;s no font-locking and I get the following error. It does work for C and other languages. Has anybody seen this?

 Study for a life in Emacs.
 pen.el was created in 2021 as an annotation tool, but I was not used it a lot at that time. Recently I picked it up and dramatically changed its usage. Now it is a complete solution of making annotations and language learning tools, right inside Emacs.
 pen relies on sqlite. All annotations are saved inside a database, which means it can be easily backup and you can read and make annotation right inside Emacs (PC/mobile) using same database.
 pen’s ideas are coming from all following great tools:
  
LingQ: Learning a language by reading
 Kindle Vocabulary Builder
 org noter
 Chatgpt
 SDCV
 go-translate
 Eudic
 蒙哥阅读器
  
and more.
 This package is mainly used along with:
  
nov-mode
 org-mode
 pdf-view-mode
 eaf-mode
  
But it is able to work with all modes in Emacs.

                              <span>I am not sure what&#x27;s happening and why, but recently I started to have this problem where Emacs just closes itself randomly while I&#x27;m working. 
 It used to happen once a day but now it crashes legit every 15 minutes. Any idea what could be the problem, or has anyone experienced something similar? 
 If I had to bet I would say it&#x27;s a Fedora problem, but how to know for sure? Because these crashes seem to only happen with Emacs.

 How can I do that in Haskell? The following doesn&#x27;t work:

                              <span>Hi, I ported org-krita and org-xournalpp with custom link. They used to be based on creating their own overlay, and in my forks they are configured with &#x60;:image-data-fun&#x60; with org-mode custom links. So I commented out their minor mode definition, as they are no longer relevent; previewing images is done with &#x60;org-display-inline-images&#x60; like all other custom links.
  
https://github.com/hermanhel/org-krita (used github because I want to pull-request)
 
https://codeberg.org/Hermanhel/org-xournalpp (don&#x27;t want to create gitlab account)
 
 story: 
 I was revamping on my solution to include visual illustrations in org-mode. I passed on them 2 because they were painful to use with that custom overlay, and they make huge overlays which is hard to adjust size. I used org-excalidraw for a bit, it was great, but the export tool it used excalidraw_export does not function properly at all in my KUbuntu 24.04 environment. I see the author&#x27;s demo works perfectly in macOS, so maybe it is because of different svg library(excalidraw&#x27;s own svg export does not display font correctly on my machine).
 I saw excalidraw use a image-data-fun, so I played around a bit and made org-krita and org-xournalpp the same. It is kind of weird that lambda do not work when I was testing, I had to declare my own functions and use function&#x27;s symbol in &#x60;:image-data-fun&#x60;.
 enjoy.

                              <span>Good afternoon, Emacsen
 I don&#x27;t honestly use tree-sitter much -- my main language is well handled by the venerable vhdl-mode. However I had been using it many moons ago for a Typst document. I had all the libraries obtained, and snagged typst-ts-mode for the part where it does things with the tree-sitter output.
 I distinctly remember there being syntax coloring when I was using it before.
 I recently opened the same Typst document, and it&#x27;s not doing anything with syntax highlighting. I dutifully updated Typst, the tree-sitter libraries, and typst-ts-mode and still no joy. I can turn on treesit-explore-mode and see tree-sitter correctly interpreting the code. So far, so good I guess. That&#x27;s the main engine. (Also (treesit-language-available-p &#x27;typst) returns true, so I think I&#x27;m pretty solidly in the tree-sitter active camp.)
 However I have been reading Mickey Peterson&#x27;s article on tree-sitter (https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter), trying to make sure there wasn&#x27;t some step I left out along the way. Also the tree-sitter Emacs documentation at https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/. This last claims that there exists a function tree-sitter-hl-mode. I tried M-x tree-sitter- and about this time, completion offers up nothing. There are no tree-sitter functions! This is Emacs 29 and it was built with tree-sitter support so I would imagine that the basic functions would be there.
 Any ideas what went pear-shaped here? I started a ticket at typst-ts-mode&#x27;s repo but I am not entirely sure if the issue is that I forgot to set something up, or if it is indeed that package.
 Thanks! I think I will remove the call to use typst-ts-mode and see if there&#x27;s any difference in behavior. I THINK there&#x27;s a slight snag when that buffer loads, but I&#x27;m not 100% certain just yet. (EDIT: doesn&#x27;t appear to be a delay so it must have been my imagination)

I&#x27;m guessing that such a thing should exist - does anyone know of any documentation about how to use it?

 What I would love: - A buffer that pops up in a posframe - When I save and quit, it has the same effect as pressing RET in the prompt - When I quit without saving it has the same effect as C-g

                              <span>Right-clicking a file in most GUI file managers provides an “Open with” menu for choosing which application should be used. I created a small package that provides such functionality for Dired.

                              <span>As the title says, I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble installing all the required dependencies to build a Scala program.
 OS: Arch linux
 JDK: 21
 What I&#x27;ve done so far:
  
Install coursier per the website instructions
 update the JDK to version 21 of OpenJdk
 Install Metals extension with vs code.
 Create a new app using sbt sbt new scala/scala3.g8
 Open with vs code and import the sbt build for metals.
 Run metals doctor and get a bunch of warnings about version mismatches.
  
It seems like the current version of coursier ships with JDK 11 and I though it would be a good idea to update a more recent one. Seems like Metals supports up to version 21, but 17 is the current default.
 So, long story short, the environment is out of sorts. What would you all do in this situation?
 Edit: Specific error messages below
 Code navigation will not work for 3 build targets in this workspace due to mis-configuration. Select &#x27;More information&#x27; to learn how to fix this problem.

That said, I am trying (purely for education) to explore this problem where my functions can return values while also modifying a key data structure, so I think using the State monad makes a lot of sense.

                              <span>I am looking for a way to have an Emacs frame that displays all term buffers as tabs (similar to a traditional terminal manager like gnome-terminal).
 The initialization of the frame that displays the terminals is easy enough using something like
  (dolist (buf (buffer-list)) (with-current-buffer buf (when (eq major-mode &#x27;term-mode) (tab-bar-new-tab) (switch-to-buffer buf)))) 
 but then such a frame should keep track of terminal buffers being killed/created and add corresponding tabs. I can probably hack my way with appropriate hooks, but I wanted to know if there&#x27;s a package that already does this.

                              <span>We all know that Emacs is more than an editor. You can spend an entire life learning Emacs. It never stops and it adapts to anything you want to do with a computer. 
 Using one, or several terminal emulator buffers inside Emacs can be extremely useful. What&#x27;s you use case?
 As for me, one thing I do often is create a keyboard macro that gathers information from one or several shell or REPL output to place it inside text file either for documentation or to create unit-test code. And sometimes I write some elisp code to do some of that. Being able to interact with an Erlang and Python REPL for example, with the OS shell of a local or remote computer and Emacs Lisp together (including with eshell) greatly enhance what can be done quickly. 
 Not all Emacs terminal emulators are made equal. I wrote a comparison table for the ones I know and what I have tested. That might be useful for others. It&#x27;s here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/shells-comparison.pdf

What are *your* use cases?

                              <span>hi all, 
 I am trying to learn Lisp, and since most of the tutorials seem to use Emacs, I am learning Emacs at the same time. 
 Now, I have a 60% keyboard, and I was wondering whether I should move to a full-sized keyboard to use Emacs more easily?
 for example, the very first example in the Portacle tutorial requires typing ~ three times, which on a 60% keyboard is Fn-S-~ , so it is a bit of gymnastics. (Portacle is a packaged installation of Common Lisp with Emacs) 
 Thank you for any advice

                              <span>So I am quite new to doom emacs (by new I mean like 5 months of using it) and org mode version 9.7 came out just recently, it supports pasting images from clipboard which is exactly the thing that was missing for me in emacs (yes I can use org download but it isn&#x27;t as fluid). Will org mode 9.7 come to doom emacs so that running &#x60;doom sync&#x60; gets the job done or will it come in a few months and until then, just manually install the latest org mode version?

                              <span>Org 9.7, a major release, is out. Org 9.7 will be a part of Emacs 30.
 You can upgrade from GNU ELPA or install with M-x package-install RET org RET
 Please, also re-install all the Org-related packages - some of the changes require re-compiling packages that use Org mode APIs.
 Release notes: https://orgmode.org/Changes.html
 Announcement: https://list.orgmode.org/87jzj7adfd.fsf@localhost/T/#u
 If you enjoy using Org, please consider supporting contributors via https://liberapay.com/org-mode/. Donations do help a lot.
 Some highlights of user-facing additions
  
Org mode supports drag-and-drop and pasting images/files from clipboard (pasting from clipboard requires Emacs &gt;&#x3D;29)
 Thanks to Visuwesh for contributing these features.

                              <span>I am trying to run a haskell project using the haskell-intellij plugin https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8258-intellij-haskell inside intellij community.
 I am working in linux mint. The stack and haskell installations are fine. Stack runs fine with the command line.
 However, I am trying to run a haskell project/script using the GUI in Intellij. In the run configurations, I am trying to create a new one using a haskell runner, but then I am not able to select my stack executable in the drop down menu. It is just blank and I cannot type the path of the executable.
 How can I fix my problem?

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a NES emulator in Haskell, and I&#x27;m getting pretty inconsistent frame rates.
 They are consistently inconsistent in the sense that I&#x27;ll have a frame run at a rate of 130 FPS, and the next one at a rate of 30 FPS, followed by another frame at 130 and so on. 
 If I run with +RTS - p -RTS, I can get a center cost that tells me which functions take the longest.
 But I&#x27;m not interested in the mean cost of each function, but rather in the variance.
 Is there any way to profile this automatically? I would really prefer not to wrap every function I have in a timer.

                              <span>If anyone has Emacs on MacOS, can you tell me what this command does on your system
  (process-lines-ignore-status &quot;osascript&quot; &quot;-e&quot; &quot;tell application \&quot;System Events\&quot; to keystroke tab using command down&quot;) 
 It&#x27;s supposed to switch away from emacs by sending Cmd+Tab. However, on my setup (GNU Emacs 29.1, MacPort), Emacs seems to be receiving C-s- (with control pressed) and I get a message C-s- is undefined on Emacs.
 If you are noticing the same behavior, any idea where the extr control is coming from?

                              <span>I have been running emacs as server/client in Wayland. Before the emacs 29 release I started compiling locally to disable X (--without-x) and enable PGTK (--with-pgtk). It was running fine. Now on 29.3 the server just fails every time I try to run it. What is the state of affairs now, and is it still an option? Does anyone have a howto?
 I&#x27;m on Fedora 40, and the packaged versions of emacs (emacs and emacs-lucid) also fail.

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m not too experienced with Emacs-fu, but I think I might be developing a case of Emacs pinky. I&#x27;ve tried making some changes—I&#x27;ve adopted evil, god-mode, and I&#x27;m planning to buy a split keyboard this year.
 The main issue I&#x27;m facing is inefficient mini-buffer navigation. For instance, I use WSL, so there are a lot of nested folders I have to navigate through, which means I end up hitting TAB a lot, and it&#x27;s painful.
 My current workflow looks something like this: C-x C-f ~/fol TAB (folder1) TAB nes er2 TAB (nested-folder2), and so on.
 For completion, I used Helm in the past. I use Vertico now because I believe I&#x27;ll be able to master it sooner than Helm. I feel it&#x27;s more predictable with more information available online on how to set it up. However, I liked how Helm handles completion with the RET flow instead of TAB unlike Vertico which opens Dired on RET. 
 Now, I have a few questions:
  
Is there a better way to navigate mini-buffer completions? 
 Is there a better way to navigate through nested folders efficiently?
 
 How can I mimic Helm-like completion behavior in Vertico?
 How do I turn off TAB completion so that I don&#x27;t keep clicking out of habit, like I do with Capslock?
  
Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, Community!
 There are different oppinions about solving algorithmic problems during hiring process. Not a big fan of it, but I still see that employers include coding tasks in such platforms. My recently I was asked to pass task in HackerRank and Codility. For another interview Codewars was recommended for preparation. I quite enjoyed https://www.codewars.com I must say (not a promotion btw just sharing personal impression), however it does not have a lot of Scala tasks.
 I assume 90% of that market is occupied by Leetcode, but still curious whether you are practising solving such small coding tasks and if so, on which platform? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey guys, I would appreciate some thoughts/opinions on this. 
 Preface: In my day to day work I am Java Dev using hibernate. I resented it at first (too much magic), but it kind of grew on me and I recently started to really appreciate it mainly in the following sense: When modeling my domain I can go full java-first, completely ignoring that my model is backed by a RDBMS, that is - code my model as if there were no DB, slap the right annotations on it, (make a few compromises here and there) and get going. It even forward engineers the ddl for me.
 So in scala world it seems to me that the accepted approach is to separate the model from the persistent model? 
 Here is why I think that: - the libraries I found map rows to case classes, but usually no built in support for inheritance, sealed trait hierachies, ... - no support for one to many aggregation - bad support for nested case class, especially if they occur multiple times
 Here is a sample of how I would model an invoice if there were no database
 scala case class Invoice( ... senderName: String, senderAddress: Address, // general purpose case class to not repeat myself recipientName: String, recipientAddress: Address, status: Status, // some sealed trait with cases like e.g. case Sent(when: LocalDate) positions: List[InvoicePosition] ... ) 
 I feel like I either - have to compromise A LOT in modeling my domain if I want to close to zero hassle with db libs out there - have my db access case classes be separated from the domain and do alot of mapping/transforming
 Any experiences, or hints? how do you handle this in your apps

                              <span>I found out from this post that this feature was removed. I tried the solution given below, but it seems like, at least with my current configuration, that my computer is not able to handle it and just shuts down emacs. I was wondering if anyone figured out a way to restore this feature. Thanks.
 Additionally, totally disabling standard org fontification (bold, italics, underline) in example blocks would be helpful, if anyone has any insight.
 Edit - The post solution worked. There was just something wrong with my installation of emacs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with composition-function-tableto add effects to certain sequences of characters, like shoving to characters closer together. I noticed that characters with descenders that extend below the baseline like &quot;g&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; can cause the line height to increase when rendered via &#x60;font-shape-string&#x60; via a custom entry in &#x60;composition-function-table&#x60;. This happens for example with the &quot;M+ Code Latin 50&quot; font, but only at certain font heights.
 The simplest reproduction is this:
 (set-char-table-range composition-function-table t &#x27;([&quot;g&quot; 0 font-shape-gstring])) 
 That causes this artifact, where typing a &quot;g&quot; causes the next line to shift downwards:
 https://cdn.zappy.app/801ae7a7b03d568b3b80500b04047054.gif
 It works fine (no line shifting) stock, but when I add an entry to &#x60;composition-function-table&#x60; the weirdness starts happening.
 I tried messing with the font in FontLab. I can fix the problem by increasing the Units per eM value, which causes the font to get smaller. I then increase the font height in Emacs to compensate. That works, but it&#x27;s an odd thing to do, and I have to make the font height pretty large to get a normal-looking actual height. Other options in FontLab like increasing the line gap, safe descender value, etc didn&#x27;t help.
 I&#x27;d like to understand why this is happening.
 EDIT: &quot;;&quot; (semicolon) is a more realistic example. I&#x27;m trying to create a ligature that will push &quot;;;&quot; closer together, for Lisp comments. However the semicolon in my font has a descender that extends below the baseline, causing the same line shifting effect as shown with the &quot;g&quot; above, when I try to use a &quot;;;&quot; ligature.

 EMACS packages are written for EMACS users, for those who use emacs&#x27; default keybindings, not for VIM users.

Are there any packages (or tools that play nice with ansi-term) that I could install to achieve btop level functionality? For instance, network and disk usage, better procedure grouping, etc?

                              <span>I want to learn more about being productive and I&#x27;m watching videos on org-mode and org-agenda but I can&#x27;t seem to visualize how I can manage my TODOS in a file?
 I have many questions like 
  
How many agenda files do you have? One for every project? Or a group of tasks? Or divided by year?
 Similarly what should the headings for the tasks be?
 How to find a particular TODO if you have multiple agenda files?
 How big do your agenda files get? What do you do if it gets too big?
 What happens to tasks that are DONE, do they get deleted or can you save them in history.
  
I need to see some example agenda files to understand how this works. I tried looking online but couldn&#x27;t find any sample org-agenda files. Do any of you guys have an agenda file you are comfortable sharing?

                              <span>Hi guys, I don&#x27;t know if this is the correct place to post this kind of question.
 Recently a colleague of mine introduced me to the wonders of Scala, which I ignored for years thinking that&#x27;s just a &quot;dead language&quot; that&#x27;s been surpassed by other languages.
 I&#x27;ve been doing some research and I was wondering why someone should start a new project in Scala when there ares new language which have a good concurrency (like Go) or excellent performance (like Rust).
 Since I&#x27;m new in Scala I was wondering if you guys could help me understand why I should use Scala instead of other good languages like Go/Rust or NodeJS.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>To understand ghc&#x27;s package management better, I decided to manually install vector package and see if it gets picked up by hls and if the final program compiles.
 I went to the vector package on hackage, saw it had two dependencies, vector-stream and primitive. I downloaded vector, vector-stream and primitive using the commands,
 cabal get primitive cabal get vector-stream cabal get vector 
 then first I compiled the dependencies primitive and vector-stream, using cabal build. That gave dist-newstyle directory.
 Inside dist-newstyle\packagedb\ghc-9.8.2 there was a .conf file, I edited it to point all the file references to the ghc package database which is ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 I placed the entire downloaded package directory (eg vector-stream-0.1.0.1) inside ghcup\ghc\9.8.2\lib\x86_64-windows-ghc-9.8.2.
 Then I registered the package with
 ghc-pkg register .conf 
 After performing above steps for primitive, vector-stream and vector respectively, vector was now being picked up by hls. GHC also compiles and links fine.
 Did I do it correctly? Will there be any issues in the future?
 I know this is not the preferred way at all, and you should be using cabal which streamlines this process. Vector had just 2 dependencies which already comes with base so it wasn&#x27;t much of a hassle. This only for learning purposes.

                              <span>I have a backend that serves HTML using Warp and Servant (https://github.com/runeksvendsen/haskell-function-graph). Because some elements on the page take up to a second to load, I want to stream HTML to the client as it&#x27;s produced, thus sending the slow-to-create HTML later.
 The HTML consists of (in order):
  
Static/pure &quot;preamble&quot; (which can be sent immediately)
 IO action streaming query results (which I want to stream as HTML one result at a time as they come in)
 A final IO action that calls out to an external process and produces HTML
  
I&#x27;m writing this post as I&#x27;m unsure what the most sensible way to achieve this is. On the one hand I would like to keep it as simple as possible — e.g. a MimeRender instance that produces a lazy ByteString. But this doesn&#x27;t seem possible as the rendering involves IO. On the other hand I want to make sure that HTML is sent out as soon as it&#x27;s produced, ie. no buffering on the server side — which makes me want to get a hold of some sendData :: Socket -&gt; IO () function, so that I&#x27;m sure data is sent out when I want it. The former seems more elegant, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible (due to performing IO to produce the ByteString) and it&#x27;s not clear to me how the server will buffer lazy ByteString chunks. The latter seems to do the job, but seems very low level.
 Any clues on how I should approach this?

                              <span>The latest version of #Scala-Native 0.5.2 now supports OS-Lib&#x27;s os.proc subprocesses. This opens up a whole world of using Scala-Native for scripting and automation, since you can now subprocess out to anything from Scala Native that you can call from Bash. 
 I tagged OS-Lib 0.10.2, which should be out soon. Please try it out!

                              <span>Hi, please consider below example,
 import scala.concurrent.{Future, Await} import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration def asyncCalculation1() &#x3D; Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 10 } def asyncCalculation2() &#x3D; Future { Thread.sleep(1000) 20 } val c &#x3D; asyncCalculation1().flatMap { a &#x3D;&gt; asyncCalculation2().map { b &#x3D;&gt; a + b } } val d &#x3D; Await.result(c, Duration.Inf) println(d) 
 As far as I understood, first thread (T1) will execute the asyncCalculation1function and content inside the Future will be handed over to a new thread (T2). Handling the flatMap function won&#x27;t a responsibility of T1 as first Future is not completed, but it will be blocked by the Await.result function until it is resolved. Or T1 is going back to the pool?
 Meanwhile T2 thread will wake up from 1sec sleep and will return 10 as the result and start executing the asyncCalculation2 function and it will create another thread (T3) while doing that. After that, what will happen to T2? Will it go back to the global thread pool this time? Or is it set to a blocked/waiting status as T1?
 And finally T3 is the one responsible for executing the callback inside the map function. And now since T3 is the last thread to complete, for whom the Await.result function is waiting for?? Is it T2 or T3 ??

                              <span>Hello all,
 I work on a remote server regularly and hence use screen for running various codes on the terminal. But now I want to switch to emacs in order to run my code instead of the terminal. I have tried screen on both vterm and eshell and both have failed to run screen. So couple of questions:
  
What is the best &quot;term/shell&quot; mode in emacs to run screen?
 If I let go the idea of using screen, and willing to adapt to other options like tmux, what is the best &quot;term/shell&quot; mode? Basically which is your preferred way to run terminal commands on emacs (which also accommodate remote screen/tmux/others)
  
Please let me know.

 I installed emacs 29.3 to test(switching from 28.2) but something is wrong with the compilation buffer. When I run &#x27;compile(with running a .sh file) another windows launches(as usual) .For some reason if .sh file outputs something emacs hangs for a half a second or even a second before rendering the output in the other buffer. The output still renders as fast as 28.2 but it hangs before rendering the first output. If there is no output for some reason it works as usual.
 This issue happens on both 29.2 and 29.3 but not on 28.2. Does anyone have any idea what could cause this?
 Edit:
 It seems like colored ansi buffer which was attached to the compilaiton buffer output causes this on 29.3 and 29.2, I disabled it and it&#x27;s fixed.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ll shortly be starting a new role as a tech writer, where much of the docs are written in Docbook and DITA.
 I&#x27;m hoping to do the bulk of my work in org-mode and export to the required format.
 I&#x27;ve seen an exporter for Docbook, but I wonder if anyone has successfully used Emacs/org-mode to work with DITA content? Any recommendations? How are custom tags handled? And how can I best work with Docbook/DITA files that were created in another editor, like OxygenXML?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering how Emacs will fare against AI code completion (i.e. copilot) as it becomes able to generate whole files of code. I get that Emacs will be able to adapt... but VSCode and Microsoft and OpenAI are becoming integrated with each other and with backend resources that will be beyond our reach. It seems like this might be the beginning of the end (for coding, anyway).

                              <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

A boolean is maybe true by Håkon Robbestad Gylterud
The following is an exploration of a few functions I found while writing various Haskell programs over the years. Their names collide with some standard function in Prelude, which is unfortunate, and while the new functions cannot be used as drop-in replacements of the prelude functions, they are morally generalisations.
cabal fields by Oleg Grenrus
cabal-fields is partly motivated by the Migrate from the .cabal format to a widely supported format issue. Whether it’s a solution or not, it’s up to you to decide.

 The example I came up with (and then setting manually &#x27;Heading 1.1&#x27; an &#x27;Heading 1.2&#x27; to DONE) doesn&#x27;t work:
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :TRIGGER: if children then self todo!(&quot;DONE&quot;) endif :END: ** Heading 1.1 ** Heading 1.2 
 Any ideas how it can be done?

                              <span>Liquid Haskell is a compiler plugin for GHC that can
verify properties
of Haskell programs. It used to be a standalone analyser tool,
but it was converted to a plugin later on. This makes it feasible to support Haskell modules that use the latest language features, and immediately integrates
the verification into the build workflows; but it also implies that Liquid Haskell
is rather coupled with the internals of GHC. A consequence of this
coupling is that a version of Liquid Haskell is likely to require
modifications to support newer versions of the compiler. The effort
of making these modifications is large enough that Liquid
Haskell has lagged three or four versions behind GHC HEAD.
Among other contributions, Tweag committed to upgrading Liquid Haskell
from version 9.0 to each major GHC …</span>

 I ask because I wonder to what extent can dependent typing already be achieved in effect in current Haskell via &#x27;emulation&#x27; (without safety guarantees) as an experiment/playground.

                              <span>As I am learning Haskell, I decided to try taking an existing function I had made and modifying it to use the State monad. I won&#x27;t go into a lot of detail, but basically it&#x27;s traversing an s-expression graph and adding each sub-expression to a new representation, called a Case. When it adds a sub-expression, it checks whether that sub-expression has already been added, and if it has, it doesn&#x27;t bother trying to add it again. In my old code, I can use a guard to do that check. In the new code, there&#x27;s no way to use a guard (I think) because the Case is the state, and thus it is not directly available until I grab it with get. I have to do that twice, since my function is matching over two patterns, and thus the version of the code using the State monad and without guards is considerably lon…</span>

                              <span>I have clang installed in a docker container which I&#x27;m able to interact with in emacs through tramp. The motivation is to replicate a dev-container like environment in emacs. As much as possible, at any rate (as per this post).
 I can access the docker container&#x27;s filesystem through the path /docker:container_name:/path/to/file. I&#x27;m using the clang-format package in emacs, which allows me to run clang-format on buffers. I&#x27;d like it to use the clang-format binary installed in the container. By default, it will look on my local filesystem, so have fiddled with the clang-format.el. It used to read:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable (or (executable-find &quot;clang-format&quot;) &quot;clang-format&quot;) &quot;Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable.&quot; :group &#x27;clang-format :type &#x27;(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 and have bodged it to the following:
 (defcustom clang-format-executable &quot;/docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format&quot; &quot;Location of the clang-format executable. A string containing the name or the full path of the executable.&quot; :group &#x27;clang-format :type &#x27;(file :must-match t) :risky t) 
 But when trying to run clang-format in a buffer, I get:
 apply: Searching for program: No such file or directory, /docker:container_name:/usr/bin/clang-format 
 Clearly I&#x27;m doing something stupid, but I&#x27;m sort of out of ideas at this point. Presumably this is actually possible; eglot can invoke &#x60;clangd&#x60; in the container as its LSP; that all works really nicely straight out of the box, but I have absolutely no idea where to even start looking in eglot to figure out how it works...

 Any one know what else I should check or how to diagnose this ? I am on linux wayland with this emacs version.
 GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 1, x86_64-solus-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.41, cairo version 1.18.0)
 Not sure what to check or why it might not be working, I have consult embark vertico orederless plugins but they all have minimal configuration.

                              <span>Read Emacs Coding-Conventions, it recommended
  
Indent the file using the default indentation parameters.
  
which means enabling indent-tabs-mode and results mixed SPACE and TAB.
 Checking some Emacs built-in packages, such as simple.el and indent.el, via global-whitespace-mode, you will find they are all mixed SPACE and TAB.
 However, many coding styles guide recommend (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil) to use spaces for indentation. No hard tabs.
 Do you use TAB or SPACE for indenting Emacs Lisp code?
 Personally, I prefer SPACE over TAB for two reasons:
  
Many other programming language now use SPACE for indentation.
 SPACE is compatible with more editors without special settings. Note that because of the tab-width variable, using TAB is not a problem in Emacs, but other editors might not. For example, this let* is not aligned on GitHub.
  
TAB has its own advantage, such as reducing code size, but it&#x27;s no longer a problem in 2024.
 Unfortunately, if you&#x27;d like to submit patches to the GNU Emacs community, you might still have to use TAB instead of SPACE to follow the convention. That is why I am still keep indent-tabs-mode enabled now.
 Any comment about it?

                              <span>Could anyone get a startup license for Akka from Lightbend? I&#x27;ve started from their website&#x27;s Pricing page. I&#x27;ve filled out the huge license request form full with invisible (!) selection boxes.
 At the end I&#x27;ve reached the confirmation page.
 License request confirmation
 A few day later I&#x27;ve got an email with a link to the same page to fill out.
  
Dear Gyula, 
  
Thank you for your interest in Lightbend and registering for an Akka Startup License. 
 The Akka Startup License is a new BSL 1.1 source Available license, for Production usage, and there is no cost for companies with under $25M in revenue. Click here to register for an Akka Startup License.
 I&#x27;ve filled the same form again ang got exctly the same response... when I&#x27;ve found myself in an infinite loop. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried to respond to their email with the subject: &quot;Last Chance for Akka Startup License!&quot; which I&#x27;ve got the same response: fill out the (same) license request form I&#x27;ve filled out twice already.
 I get marketing newsletters since the first application, but still no idea how to reach them to get a startup license for my own small company. (way below $25M revenue)
 Any help would be most welcome!

                              <span>I&#x27;d definitely like to know about them, especially if they&#x27;re younger. I&#x27;ve tried researching this and thought they&#x27;re just extremely rare, but every day I learn about more companies using Scala I didn&#x27;t know of (but, they&#x27;ve usually been around for +10 years though), so it got me curious if there are some that have been founded relatively recently. These are just some I know of:
  
Verneek
 Narrative
 Ziverge
 Conduktor
  
And these are all US-based, so I&#x27;m sure there are others in other countries!

                              <span>It seems currently the webdev tech is trending where the client side computations are sourced to the server side. After each user interaction with the web app, the server renders a new HTML, computes the diff, sends it to the client and the thin JS layer on the client side applies it to update the page.
 This tech is available with:
  
Elixir Phoenix - Live View
 Ruby on Rails - Hotwire
 C# Blazor
  
At a glance, it&#x27;s an exciting tech as you no longer need to worry about splitting your app into two platforms, or at least minimize such a split.
 AFAIK Play or any other Scala web framework doesn&#x27;t feature anything like that. Has anyone been working on an implementation for Scala? What are your thoughts on the tech? Particularly, Elixir claims they e.g. have an advantage over Ruby due to its parallel-first runtime - how do you think Scala&#x27;s parallel capabilities (Akka, Pekko) relate to Elixir&#x27;s runtime?

                              <span>Hi,
 I often find myself wanting to edit TODO headers when viewing the Agenda (spelling errors, better phrasing, clarifying etc etc).
 My current process is: go to the offending line -&gt; follow link to org file with TODO item -&gt; edit header text -&gt; save org-file -&gt; reload Agenda view.
 But I can&#x27;t stop thinking there must be a better/quicker way of doing this, something like Wdired for Agenda view?

                              <span>Hi everyone! 
 I just started to organise myself with org-mode and org-roam. I tried out a bunch of different programs(notion, anytype, obsidian, logseq). From all of those Obsidian was the best since it was so easy to implement a working note taking system(and a second brain). The only problem with Obsidian is that it&#x27;s not open-source and I can&#x27;t use it on my work machine, so I decided to look for other options.
 In my work life I live in neovim like 90% of the time and I don&#x27;t want to change that. (I tried Emacs for work, but that was a bad experience, since the lsp was slow and I spent several seconds between jump-to-definition etc.)
 I heard a lot about org-mode before, so I decided to give it a try and man.. I love it already. I see the unlimited possibilities(thatswhy it&#x27;s so unfortuante that I can&#x27;t use emacs as a primary IDE). 
 Now I&#x27;m trying to setup a meeting and personal tasking process for myself. In Obsidian I used the following people and meeting notes suggestion and it was very nice. people notes template, meeting notes template
 I&#x27;m looking for something similar. What I really like:
  
I have autocompletion for attendees
 I can query for meeting for an attendee in their person notes
 I can capture a new person very easily
 I can capture a new meeting either quickly or retroactively
  
I&#x27;m still learning the capabilities of org, org-roam, so I just wanted to ask you how to implement a similar approach? 
 Do you have any other recommendation for me?
 I also like that I can leave next actions as todos, so I can see them in org-agenda.

                              <span>https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/completing-read-strings
 The package provides a function, completing-read-strings, that allows to read strings in the minibuffer, with completing-read under the hood.
 Usage:
 (completing-read-strings &quot;PROMPT: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third&quot;)) 
  
The candidates are chosen by pressing RET.
 Pressing C- erases the last chosen candidate.
 Pressing C- exits reading and returns the list of chosen candidates.
  
Rationale
 In completing-read-multiple, the result list of chosen strings is made by splitting the input string with crm-separator regular expression variable.
 This approach is not suitable in several situations:
  
Candidates might contain the default , separator. In this case, the candidate with , inside will be treated as two typed candidates:
  
Example:
 (completing-read-multiple &quot;PROMPT: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third&quot;)) ;;  ;; &#x3D;&gt; (&quot;sec&quot; &quot;ond&quot;) 
 A developer have to locally rebind crm-separator and tell the user which character to type to separate the candidates.
 (let ((crm-separator &quot;[ \t]*|[ \t]*&quot;)) (completing-read-multiple &quot;Type &#x60;|&#x27; to select another candidate: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third&quot;))) 
  
Candidates might contain any character, so it&#x27;s hard to pick easily typed separator. Example: Org headings, file names. In this case a developer might use \n as a separator, which a user can enter by pressing C-o and moving the cursor 1 char forward to be able to display the list of candidates (which is not convenient).
  
Example:
 (let ((crm-separator &quot;[ \t]*\n[ \t]*&quot;)) (completing-read-multiple &quot;Prompt: &quot; &#x27;(&quot;first.&quot; &quot;sec,ond&quot; &quot;third;&quot;))) 
 completing-read-strings solves the issue by providing a function that have the same interface for all kind of candidates. Internally, collects the chosen candidates into a list during reading and then returns it (without the need to split the input string with regular expression).

                              <span>Hey all,
 I sometimes want LSP to auto-import some dependencies. When I call &#x60;lsp-execute-code-action&#x60;, expecting auto-import action to be executed, emacs creates empty file and moves me to there instead.
 When there is no code action, LSP inserts a dumb action for creating a new file and moving there. So if LSP is too slow to find out the actual code action needed, it creates a new file instead.
 This issue is ruining my workflow and wanted to ask if anyone else encountered. I got following shourtcut in my setup:
 (local-set-key (kbd &quot;M-i f&quot;) &#x27;lsp-execute-code-action)
 Any recommendations?

I also published 3 scripts that support Linux and macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon CPU).
  
e : start independent Emacs process in terminal mode
 ge: start independent Emacs process in graphics mode
 ec: start an Emacs client in terminal or graphics mode, start the Emacs daemon if it&#x27;s not already running. Also has option to check if the daemon is running or just start the daemon.

                              <span>I use Mouse to operate Emacs. 
 Place the cursor somewhere (pos1) at LINE 1 (without mark anything), then scroll the text down through the window, press SHIFT and click at somewhere (pos2) at LINE 1000. The expected behavior is selecting all text content between pos1 and pos2, just like VS CODE and other modern editors. Is this behavior possible in Emacs?
 One possible technical barrier I found is that Emacs cursor moves as the screen scrolls and cannot be fixed in a certain position, except mark it manually. 
 P.s. I know there is variable &#x60;scroll-preserve-screen-position&#x60;, but it is not what I want.

                              <span>Agda is a dependently typed language. Idris is a dependently typed language, but with a less particular focus on mathematical theorem proving. Haskell does not have dependent types as such. All three of the languages are part of the Haskell universe.
 Outside of academia (Agda, ?Idris/Idris2), what could be some advantages of dependent types? 
 Note: indeed, &#x27;outside of&#x27; is a relative term here--many say Haskell is an ivory tower language.

 * TODO Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :BLOCKER: children :END: ** TODO Heading 2 ** TODO Heading 3 
 How can I do the opposite? Trigger the parent to be DONE once the children are DONE? I tried this, but it doesn&#x27;t work:
 * Heading 1 :PROPERTIES: :TRIGGER: if children then todo!(DONE) endif :END: ** Heading 2 ** Heading 3

                              <span>I recently upgraded from emacs 28.2 to 29.3. I noticed that if I opened an 11MB org-mode file (that used to give me no problems with speed or performance on 28.2) and then invoked org-refile once, then suddenly any user interaction involving the big 11MB buffer (from text entry to simply activating the buffer) would take forever to execute.
 I wondered if it was something in my config, and eventually noticed that switching org-refile-use-cache from t to the default nil stopped the slowdown from happening after invoking org-refile. I confirmed the issue was seemingly solved by running a minimal org-mode config in an emacs -Q session and observing that the slowdown only happened if org-refile-use-cache was set to t.
 So I decided to just stop setting org-refile-use-cache to t and everything …</span>

                              <span>I currently use Google Contacts to manage my contacts on Android and PC (web app). But I&#x27;m now trying to get rid of Google (I just started using notmuch, goimapnotify, mbsync, msmtp, etc. instead of Gmail web app).
 I read that synching Google Contacts with a Desktop was a nightmare, so I thought about using an open-source Android contact management app instead (like Fossify Contact, OpenContacts or ConnectYou).
 The idea would be to start from a Google Contact export and then continuously populate either the Mobile app or the Desktop app.
 On the Desktop side, I&#x27;d prefer to use Emacs (e.g. ebdb or org-contact). Ideally, Syncthing would do the sync between Mobile and Desktop.
 I couldn&#x27;t find tutorials on how to implement this. Would you have any advice (my desktop OS is Linux Arch)?

 Resulting buffer
 Original buffer
 It looks like every character is swapped with something. It is reflective too which is very interesting in my opinion.
 It also looks like the frame is cursed, not the buffer :D. I can confirm that by opening the buffer in any other frame or opening any other buffer in this frame.
 What I wonder is if this is like an Easter Egg, or a bug?

                              <span>So, I was trying to use the &#x60;goto-char&#x60; command for something. While doing that I wondered what would happen if I used it with a negative argument in minibuffer. When it asked me the character, I entered -1. This had very ... interesting results.
 Resulting buffer
 Original buffer
 It looks like every character is swapped with something. It is reflective too which is very interesting in my opinion.
 It also looks like the frame is cursed, not the buffer :D. I can confirm that by opening the buffer in any other frame or opening any other buffer in this frame.
 What I wonder is if this is like an Easter Egg, or a bug?

                              <span>How is the support for tree-sitter syntax highlight on LaTeX files currently? I&#x27;ve been using Emacs 29 with tree-sitter explicitly enabled when building it (probably redundant for 29, but just to be sure), and still couldn&#x27;t find a way to enable it for TeX mode. Could someone using it now help me by pointing out where to start to make it work?

 Any idea about why it freezes or hangs?

                              <span>To any elisp developers out there, please don&#x27;t hardcode the name and options for external programs. A better alternative is to use variables named -program and -program-options , or -command and -command-options . 
 Relying on $PATH for program resolution is great until it doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I just installed a brand new Debian GNU/Linux 12 box, then installed GNU Emacs 28.2 using &#x60;apt-get install emacs&#x60;. It works fine. But when editing a regular text-file, I find about one time in eight that I press the space bar, as well as inserting the space, it emits a beep, as though I had typed C-g. This seems to be random: sometimes I will type 20 or more spaces with no beeps, other times two or three consecutive spaces might beep. The space-bar is bound to regular self-insert-command as you would expect.
 Does anyone know how to prevent this harmless but very irritating quirk?
 (And why is it happening straight out of the box?)

                              <span>Hi there i am a student and have a github student dev pack. It comes with copilot and I use it when something don&#x27;t make sense in my code and to write commit messages and do a quick chat in vscode. I cant affort any other paid service and i hate using vscode. Neovim has a great extension for copilot chat with plethora of features but on emacs side the support is very minimal with just the copilot.el. I can understand why such thing land late in emacs community due to FOSS principles and i totally respect that. Should i lose hope on good copilot support in emacs and just accept the reality? Folks who use copilot is there any good copilot package that i am not aware of?

 You can see the glitching on left side of screen. I use NixOS with Hyprland and Emacs 29 (PGTK) with some transparency. I turn on my line numbers with &#x60;(nix-ts-mode . display-line-numbers-mode)&#x60; for example. I notice after resizing the frame all goes back to normal. Any ideas ?

                              <span>I am trying to implement a typst inline live preview. I know there is a package that does the full typst preview using a web browser, but I want to have the svg images displayed inline inside an org buffer. I see that using the svg library we can create new svg images and have them displayed in real time, but can this be done with the output of typst?

                              <span>I am interested in your stories about the most cursed ways you have seen Haskell been used.
 Just the ways you have seen people use Haskell that goes completely against the way it is meant to be used.
 Bonus if it was code used in prod.

                              <span>doctest is an amazing tool to maintain a consistent documentation, but also to avoid writing separate test files in some cases.
 There are multiple implementation of doctest with different tradeoffs:
  
doctest: the original one. See this pretty example: r/haskell/comments/14xizu0/haddockdoctestcairo/
 doctest-parallel. See its announcement: r/haskell/comments/rnkof1/ann_doctestparallel_isolate_and_speed_up_your/
 doctest-extract
 Maybe more, please share!
  
What is you experience with them and which one do you prefer?

 I&#x27;m going to create a large document (think like a book). I&#x27;m new to org mode. Will org mode allow me to publish this book into multi-page HTML? Say, like a section per html page, or even a chapter per page? Or do I have to manually maintain and link all the separate pages?

 As sage is just python in syntax, is there someway to keep using python for syntax and highlighting, but use sage as the label?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to using Doom Emacs, but I&#x27;ve already fallen in love with it. Before using Doom Emacs, I used Visual Studio (for Unity and Unreal Engine) and VSCode for other projects. My question is, is it viable to use Doom Emacs with Unity and Unreal Engine, or should I stick with Visual Studio and change VSCode for emacs(basically use Doom emacs for other projects that dont require a game engine like unreal or unity and use Visual Studio for those two)?

                              <span>What I mean is I have a hydra menu for shortcuts to all my common files like so:
  (&quot;ce&quot; (find-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;) &quot;emacs&quot;) 
 which runs find file on the exact path given after I open the menu and press the keys &quot;ce&quot;.
 Now I also want to add shortcuts to all my common directories but doing something like:
  (&quot;hd&quot; (find-file &quot;~/Downloads/&quot;) &quot;downloads&quot;) 
 runs the find-file on the exact directory path which just opens a dired directory into Downloads. 
 What I really want though is after typing &quot;hd&quot; it opens the minibuffer with find-file command (as happens when you type C-X C-f) with the ~/Downloads path already open so I can just pick a file from Downloads from the minibuffer itself.
 Is there a function to make something like this possible?

                              <span>Hi,
 After reading a couple of posts on here covering aspects of gc-cons-threshold, I checked the documentation too. 
 As a not-very advanced Emacs user, I will admit that the topic is not very clear. Trying to summarize what I think I read:
  
by setting the gc-cons-threshold to a high value, garbage collection can be temporarily delayed
 
a large value shouldn&#x27;t be used as the default.
 
 If the above is correct, would that suggest that:
  
I could set the gc-cons-threshold to a higher value at the beginning of the init.el
 
Use the after-init-hook to reset the value to a lower/default value.
 
 Does the above make sense or have I misunderstood the other threads/documentation?
 As regards the gc-cons-percentage, the doc says &quot;If this portion is smaller than ‘gc-cons-threshold’, this is ignored&quot;. How can I check this?
 thank you

                              <span>I wanted to look at how we highlight a major ts mode (to understand it and see if I can easily do it for markdown with injections) 
 I just took a look at python-ts-mode and saw that
 it does
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;(setq-local treesit-font-lock-settings python--treesit-settings)&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and after that to my surprise I checked python--treesit-settings and it kind of reimplements the same capture groups as the highlight file already created by the tree-sitter-python github https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/blob/master/queries/highlights.scm
 for example
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 :feature &#x27;number
 :language &#x27;python
 &#x27;([(integer) (float)] @font-lock-number-face)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 already exists in the highlights file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 [
 (integer)
 (float)
 ] @number&#x60;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 why can&#x27;t we just use the highlight group &#x60;@number&#x60; somehow and set it to &#x60;@font-lock-number-face&#x60;
 seems a lot of double work if we do it for every language

 What is so special about haskell ? What can be done easier i.e more simply with it than with other languages ?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use Debug.Trace a lot in my project for quick and flexible generation of debug statements - without having to change my code (e.g. adding IO). However, since recently i do want to save my debugging output to a file. For this i thought i could redefine trace:
 myTrace :: String -&gt; a -&gt; a myTrace msg x &#x3D; unsafePerformIO $ do withFile &quot;debug.log&quot; AppendMode $ \h -&gt; do hPutStrLn h msg hFlush h -- Ensure the message is flushed to the file immediately return x 
 This works in some cases, but when applying everywhere in where i originally used trace, i quickly get: *** Exception: debug.log: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
 Understandable. Is there an alternative approach for what i am trying to achieve? (writing quick debug statements to a file without having to change my code structure too much)
 Thanks

                              <span>(For some context, I use dynamic, interpreted languages in my work, primarily Clojure and Python these days. For fun, I have been learning about compiled languages such as Go, OCaml, and Haskell, and I&#x27;m looking for parallels across these languages.)
 I see a lot of posts here asking what monads and functors are. Obviously there&#x27;s a lot that can go into answering that question, but I have been thinking about one simple answer. Monads and functors, like all type classes, are abstractions. That is, they take some abstract concept, such as (in the case of functors) applying a function to all the values within a computational context, and they apply this abstract concept to the concrete implementation across several different data structures.
 In doing this, type classes serve two purposes. Fi…</span>

We were able to push her up to 1 million requests per second!!! On just 8 RDS instances.
 We also shipped a #Rust Akka client, extending Akka to run natively on #edge devices. “Akka Edge Rust” provides a subset of Akka implemented with the Rust programming language.
 Write simpler and more expressive code with Java 21.
 Plus much more https://www.lightbend.com/blog/akka-2405-more-security-more-performance-more-efficiency
  
Congrats to Lightbend and all the contributors behind Akka ! 👏
 Akka is recognized as one of the most prominent Scala toolkits and and has also served as the basis for the open-source fork, Pekko.

                              <span>Hey,
 My question is: 
 How can I link from an external source (for example a calendar entry in gcal) to a specific orgmode heading in an orgfile ? (so i can jump directly from the calendar entry to the corresponding notes)
 Using orgmode in spacemacs on macos. 
 **Sorry, for the perhaps dumb question as I am still pretty new to orgmode - though I googled for quite a bit and was not able to find any useful answer.
 Thanks so much in advance for your help 🙏.

                              <span>I can create a simple completing read prompt to choose from a list. Is it possible to get marginalia descriptions that come from an alist or some other static data structure?
 Update: Marginalia does not have anything to do with the functionality I am asking about. Instead the annotation feature mentioned below can do it in vanilla Emacs.

                              <span>After years without issue where I could choose, for example, to see my daily work agenda, the filters are now failing to be applied. This is in org 9.6.15, as shipped with my emacs 29.3. Here is my definition from my use-package org :custom section:
  (org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;w&quot; . &quot;Work&quot;) (&quot;wd&quot; &quot;Work Day&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 1) (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil) (org-agenda-regexp-filter-preset &#x27;(&quot;+ODH\\|AGENDA\\|CONFERENCE&quot; &quot;-TSA\\|PRIESTHOOD&quot;))))) nil))) 
 Why has this stopped applying my filter when it worked for so long? Is it a bug, or do I need to change something to make it up-to-date?
 (I&#x27;m cross-posting this to both reddit and the orgmode mailing list since the two audiences might not overlap much)

                              <span>I set my projectile path and projects were indexed correctly. But I still have to start my lsp manually and tell it its project root. Can I somehow configure lsp-mode that it uses projectile&#x27;s project root and set it to start automatically? 
 I read online that Doom starts lsp-mode in deferred mode but this doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case as I have to start it manually. I&#x27;m using default config with (go +lsp) under :lang.
 And another problem. If I start lsp in one buffer and use lsp-rename it only renames in the current buffer and not in the project.

start Emacs
 run treesit-install-language-grammar and choose rust and all default settings
 run rust-ts-mode, now working because a tree sitter grammer is now available
 install rust-analyzer using rustup
 M-x eglot RET
  
I have done all these steps, but eglot fails to start. I get the error:

 I even ran Emacs with emacs -Q and performed the steps in order, except for installing rust-analyzer, because it is already installed. Still seeing the same message when I M-x eglot. To me this message seems to indicate, …</span>

                              <span>First of all, I d like to thank all the contributors to this subreddit, I have learned a lot from it over the years. 
 The question I have is as follows. Let&#x27;s say I have two windows open side by side in a frame, and I have two different directories open in dired in each of the windows. Is it possible to save this set of windows/layout and quickly switch to it in the future? Or when I&#x27;m programming, I typically have a main window with my code on the left with two smaller windows (compilation and vterm) next to it. I would like to be able to quickly switch between sets of predefined windows within a frame. Wouldn&#x27;t that be amazing? Is such a thing possible?

                              <span>On my Windows 10 machine, I finally made the jump from emacs 28.2 to 29.3 today (by installing from the standard emacs-29.3-installer.exe from the GNU mirror. I noticed an immediate slowdown of the whole program when I opened a large (10MB) org file that had never caused me trouble in version 28.2.
 I’ve read similar stories about emacs 29 being slow, but I figured it would have been fixed by now. Is the only solution to compile my own, as described here?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 2+ years now. I started using because of its capabilities in VHDL coding, but soon got inspired by its efficiency. However, I feel I am severely underutilizing its potential. I&#x27;m a PhD student in Computer Engineering, and mainly use it for coding in python (with jedi). With this context, I want to ask the following questions:
  
Best package for Python? I find jedi decent, but not coding-friendly. I want to code faster in Python.
 For a Mac user, what are the key-bindings you suggest is optimal?
 Best use cases of org-mode as a PhD student?
 Best LaTeX packages &amp; engines I need to install on Emacs? Currently I use Overleaf to work with collaborators, but would love to work on Emacs and push things to Overleaf (my vim friend does this).
 Ways to use Co-Pilot on Emacs? Is it worth it?
 Any other cool Emacs things (packages or modes) I should learn as a PhD student?
 Any cool stuff that can wow me about Emacs?
  
Please feel free to help even if you are not a PhD student. My goal is to learn how to use Emacs better at the end of the day..

                              <span>35% improvement on clean builds on my projects -- that&#x27;s pretty impressive for a one line change to build.sbt file(s):
 ThisBuild/usePipelining :&#x3D; true 
 Since I&#x27;m all-in on Scala 3 I just added the flag to my ~/.sbt/1.0/global.sbt.
 Sounds like this is just the first pass (heh, literally, see the PR), so we should be seeing still further speedups down the line -- amazing work, thanks team EPFL and Scala Center!
 p.s. merged PR is available in recently released 3.5.0-RC1

                              <span>So I was reading the book Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton. In chapter 11, the game tic-tac-toe is implemented. My question is about the AI part of the game, where minimax is used. I was a little bit confused about the prune function:
 prune :: Int -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a
 prune 0 (Node x _) &#x3D; Node x []
 prune n (Node x ts) &#x3D; Node x [prune (n-1) t | t &lt;- ts]
 Why do we need such a prune function in Haskell (which has lazy evaluation). Why can&#x27;t we just create a single infinite game tree, and run the fitness function on it to a certain depth, without creating a new finite tree via pruning? We can then reuse the same tree, by cutting it from the top after each move, and sort of expanding the (same) tree downwards. Shouldn&#x27;t this also work? 
 I then saw that one of the exercises of that chapter was:
 generate the game tree once, rather than for each move 
 A solution for that exercise is provided here by someone on Github. However, it seems to me that here a new tree is generated after each move, and thus the tree is not shared during the whole game.

 Is there an online place where I can paste some Scala 2 code with required braces, and have it show me that same code converted into Scala 3 braceless syntax?
 Does Scastie do it? If so, how? {related ticket, please go vote for it}
 Does the IntelliJ Scala plug-in facilitate it? If so, how? (related ticket, please go vote for it)
  
Here&#x27;s a solution posted as a Reddit comment
  
This auto conversion would be invaluable for anyone who is distantly related to a Scala 2 project (or StackOverflow Question or Answer) and would like to easily explore the new Scala 3 syntax without having to invest a whole day in spurious technical tangents trying to configure something to enable them to do so.
 There are almost 20 years of Scala 2 codebases and forum code snippets where this would ease the ROI analysis of a Scala 3 explorer.
 tl;dr The overhead for experimenting with converting a Scala 2 code snippet into Scala 3 braceless syntax is so high for all but the most motivated Scala advocates.
 Wouldn&#x27;t reducing the barrier to entry for casual drive-by exploration in something like Scastie (or IntelliJ) with a Scala 2 code snippet from the wild seems like it would be worth its weight in attention-grabbing and capturing the legions of possibly interested Java and Python software engineers?

                              <span>I just upgraded to auctex 14.0.5 from emacs 29.3 running on macos. I had previously been using 14.0.3 and now the c-C c-C no longer is bound to TeX-command-master. I can fix that, but now TeX-command-master no longer seems to know the state of compilation (i.e. if it needs processing, it needs pdflatex, if bibtex needs to be run, etc.). In particular, if I choose View, it no longer defaults to opening in Preview.app (which is my choice). Why did it change all of my defaults and how can I get them back?

                              <span>the scenario is the tmux usual: i’m at A running a important process but need to go to B.
 is there a feature exclusively in emacs that will allow me to “detach” from the current session, close the lid of my laptop, go to B, reattach, all while the process is running?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using rjsx-mode package to work on jsx files and would like to add it to be the default mode to mdx files as well. Config currently looks like this with use-package:
 (use-package rjsx-mode
 :mode (&quot;\\.tsx\\&#x27;&quot;)
 :hook ((rjsx-mode . lsp-deferred)
 (rjsx-mode . emmet-mode))
 :config
 (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-enabled-clients &#x27;ts-ls))
 I can add &quot;\\.mdx\\&#x27;&quot; to the mode definition however I want to use a different lsp client for the file type specifically mdx-language-server rather than ts-ls. Trying to decide the best way to handle this. I think one way would be to derive a mode from rjsx-mode but that seems like it might be overkill since there is no mode difference, just a difference in the configuration block. Probably thinking of the problem wrong.

                              <span>Hi,
 Since I consider myself a part of this subreddit for some years, I wanted to let you know that I&#x27;m going to stop using reddit.
 As you might have expected, I&#x27;ve written a blog article explaining the reasons.
 I won&#x27;t say that I will never ever log in to my reddit account and might contribute a comment in future. But chances to do so are poor because I will remove reddit from my feeds.
 I&#x27;m certainly not going to miss reddit as a platform. I surely will miss this subreddit community here. You&#x27;ve been great and I hope you will follow my ideas on embracing open solutions like Atom/RSS/Fediverse/Usenet in order to connect to each other for topics related to this subreddit.
 For now, I&#x27;m focusing on my blog, my Mastodon account, my new PIM lecture starting in October, and maybe also start writing on my PIM book which is in the concept and planning stage for over a decade.
 I really hope to see you on a better platform which respects its users and their contributions.

                              <span>Hello all, I am wondering if there are any simple projects that demonstrate how to call functions from a Haskell library in C or C++? Most of the examples I have found are quite old and don&#x27;t use Cabal to build the Haskell library. Any example projects on how to do this would be very appreciated!
 My goal is to use CMake to build the C++ code and include the library. I am having a hard time linking to GHC&#x27;s RTS.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen people discuss about monad transformers, lenses, traversables, monoids etc when they discuss their projects. I was thinking about doing multiple mini projects to learn and understand each types/type classes. My end goal is to make some server side projects in Haskell and to be ready to work with types and type class things when I use those frameworks or db frameworks like persistent. So what kind of smaller projects helped you learn particular types/type class. Is there some website like typeclassopedia that&#x27;d give some exercise, mini projects to teach these concepts?

 minbpe-hs
 Introduction
 minbpe-hs is a port of Andrej Karpathy&#x27;s concise byte-level byte pair encoding (BPE) implementation, minbpe, to Haskell. During training, BPE compresses a sequence by repeatedly finding the most frequent pair of elements in the input and merging them into a new token whilst maintaining a record of the merges and the tokens. Encoding is performed by recursively merging pairs with the smallest merge index until there remain no pairs to be merged, and encoded representations can be decoded backed into the original through vocabulary look-ups. Given its recursive nature, BPE lends itself naturally to functional programming, and the objective of this repository is to offer an alternative functional formulation of it that is orthogonal to typical imp…</span>

This flow diagram was introduced in Field Report #5: How I Prepare Reading and Processing Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson:

I was hoping to discuss/ask some questions regarding it as I was recently processing it.
I&#x27;m guessing @Sascha will have to speak to this the most. But I am happy to have any others engage or share their thoughts.
Human Group
I was trying to understand the &quot;Human&quot; grouping and its sub-entities. What is it supposed to mean exactly? Is it what is happening within a human? Is there a semantic difference between the shapes under &quot;human&quot; and &quot;zettelkasten?&quot;
Is the entity under &quot;human&quot; an emergent outcome of the process it is connected to? For example, &quot;overview of literature&quot; is emerges in human understanding (ideally) when &quot;researching&quot; the &quot;Sources of the world&quot; and finding &quot;Promising sources&quot;?
Zettelkasten Group
What is the difference between the general group Zettelkasten (as opposed to Human) and the container &quot;Zettelkasten&quot; that has the two entities and one process &quot;Atomic thoughts and connections,&quot; &quot;Structuring &amp; Integrating,&quot; and &quot;Overview, Tools, Complex Insights&quot;? Is the general group the Zettelkasten Method and the container the actual archive?
And, if the general group &quot;Zettelkasten&quot; is the Zettelkasten Method, what should the whole be called since the Zettelkasten method is a part of the whole?
Pre-processing
Is this a part of the barbell method (the first pass) or not?</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone.
I consider this forum kind of “highly lectured” because we are all fans of knowledge and pretty much love to read, learn and improve everything we do. I picture us as carpenters working in the middle of the woods crafting excellence, although instead of wood and carpenter tools we use our brains, our zettlekasten and pen.
I don’t want to say too much because it’s not the point. Let’s just say I lost something that was really important to me. Something I cared, cherished, loved, tried to understand and that always put a smile on my face.
Now that it’s lost I have to learn what to do with this. I meditate and being mindful of all the feelings that arise inside me has been a really interesting experience. It of course doesn’t stop the grief or the sadness, but I think it makes it healthy. I’m at peace with my feelings, seeing me as the place where the river just has to flow.
I’m considering reading Albert Camus - The Stranger and No Mud no Lotus - Thich Nhat Hanh.
I’ve read before this event in my life works from stoicism and Buddhism which I think are really helping me to experience this in the best way possible.
Well, thanks for reading and I will appreciate the suggestions of books you found helpful during times where your psyche was put to the test.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a small program in Haskell that allows me to interact with Google&#x27;s Gemini via Terminal and via VIM.
 It worked for about a week and then, suddenly, every request resulted in a connection timeout.
 At first, I thought the issue was with my API key, or with the fact that I was using a VPN. But while debugging, I&#x27;ve discovered that EVERY SINGLE REQUEST done with http-conduit fails.
 For example: If I open ghci -package http-conduit and run
 parseRequest &quot;GET https://www.facebook.com&quot; &gt;&gt;&#x3D; httpBS 
 I get a Connection timeout exception.
 It does not matter what website I choose. I should say that CURL has no problem getting the responses, so it is definitely not my internet connection (evidenced by the fact that I&#x27;m asking for help here).
 What could be causing this?

 Let&#x27;s say I have a lot of open buffers, then do consult-buffer and type .py. From there I do embark-collect and now I have a collection buffer with all of the matching buffers from consult-buffer. Now I want to embark-act consult-line-multi on all of those buffers in the collection, so I can search only the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve narrowed down previously.
 This behaves in the way you expect using the buffer name as the search parameter for consult-line-multi searching across all of my buffers. Is there some additional step I can add to make consult-line-multi only search the collected buffers?
 Thanks for the help.

 I have DOOM Emacs and I have +pretty enabled (org_superstar and org_fancy_priorities). When I try to use the nerd icons, the headers loose their highlight. 
 Any idea what I could do to fix this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had emacs set up as a webdev environment for javascript and php.
 I&#x27;ve got web-mode installed for these languages, and I had lsp-mode running. 
 Earlier this evening lsp stopped working.
 When I would open a php or js file, a message would come up in the minibuffer indicating that the respective language server woudn&#x27;t start.
 I nuked my emacs config and then I uninstalled and reinstalled the language servers and emacs.
 Then I reinstalled web-mode and lsp.
 But I&#x27;m still getting the same issue.
 At the moment my messages buffer has these lines repeating:
  
LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49920/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Server ts-ls:49920/starting exited (check corresponding stderr buffer for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n) y
 LSP :: Restarting LSP in buffer test.js
 LSP :: Connected to [ts-ls:49926/starting /home/mantis/tmp].
 LSP :: ts-ls has exited (exited abnormally with code 1)
 Beginning of buffer [6 times]
 previous-line: Beginning of buffer [20 times]
  
So how do I fix this mess?
 I&#x27;ve gotten very used to emacs for js/php and I&#x27;d really like to keep using it. But I need these IDE features.

                              <span>Hello, everyone.
 About a year ago, I started noticing random freezing of Emacs when saving files, freezing so long to the point that Emacs starts crashing. They were super annoying as 1) the crashes never saves anything and I lose some of my progress, even with autosaves; 2) they seem to happen frequent enough to notice, yet too sporadic to reproduce and investigate.
 Over a couple months, I ran some bisects and located the issue: it was the GC threshold.
 I tried blindly setting gc-cons-threshold myself and installing GCMH. The problems still persisted.
 I removed the GC setting for quite some time, but the noticeable slowdown during editing made be return to GCMH. With it came back the problem.
 Is there any reason behind this behavior? Is there a way to correct this?
 My Emacs configurations can be found in: here.
 Thanks a ton!

                              <span>Sure, I can hit C-x h to mark my whole .emacs file, then hit TAB. That, yes, indents it properly. But I want something more powerful. Something like perltidy. Perltidy knows we might not be like Bill Gates with big rooms filled with extra wide monitors. So it knows when to politely break a line into two for us, whereas TAB is too chicken.

                              <span>Hiya, just released this package that I was working on these past two days..
 It is a readwise integration for org-mode that will sync your readwise highlights into a org-format buffer or file.
 I use readwise heavily for highlights in both physical books and ebooks and have during the past year started using readwise reader heavily to annotate webpages and got so tired of not having a proper way to sync the highlights and notes into emacs. So I decided to just roll my own solution!
 There are quite a few quirks with the package right now, the main one being that it currently cleans the buffer and then repopulates it with the newly synced entries.. I am working for a smarter fix for this where it actually respects the buffer contents and just adds new highlights or modifies changed highlights to the correct entries, but I need to make this perfomant enough to not be a pain in the bottom to use..
 Well, here is the code! https://github.com/CountGreven/org-readwise I hope this helps some of you!

                              <span>Using math-preview from https://gitlab.com/matsievskiysv/math-preview I enjoy the the fact that no preview images are generated but all math is displayed using mathjax.
 However, I also enjoy using siunitx. Unfortunately siunitx v.3 is not supported by mathjax v.3, or even worse, siunitx.js for mathjax is no longer maintained ( https://github.com/burnpanck/MathJax-siunitx ). As a consequence, equations containing siunitx commands are not displayed using mathjax, e.g. you still see
 \begin{equation}
 \left[ L \right] &#x3D; \unit{\ohm\second} &#x3D; \unit{\henry} 
 \end{equation} 
 when previewing.
 Does anybody has some ideas to circumvent the problem by defining some dummy routines substituting the siunitx stuff, e.g. the display could be
 [L] &#x3D; \ohm\second &#x3D; \henry
 or just
 [L] &#x3D; 
 Maybe even a secret siunitx.js v.3 is arround...

                              <span>Hey Folks, I&#x27;m building an API which needs to check if the uploaded file have any malicious information. It would be helpful if someone can help me with the availabile libraries and practices that we arw following for file upload. 
 In java, I have found ClamAV library but it&#x27;s client Library and on this link they said that it is not maintained as of now.https://index.scala-lang.org/hmrc/clamav-client

                              <span>Hi folks, I&#x27;d appreciate some basic assistance. I&#x27;m playing around with sum types (or ADTs) of records, and I get this odd bit of behavior.
  ghci&gt; :set -XRecordWildCards ghci&gt; data V &#x3D; V{x :: Int, y :: Int} | W{a :: Int, b :: Int} deriving Show ghci&gt; testq v@V{..} &#x3D; v{x &#x3D; 9} ghci&gt; testq w@W{..} &#x3D; w{a &#x3D; 9} ghci&gt; testq x &#x3D; x ghci&gt; :t testq testq :: p -&gt; p ghci&gt; testq V{x &#x3D; 1, y &#x3D; 1} V {x &#x3D; 1, y &#x3D; 1} 
 First, I don&#x27;t know why the type of the function is p -&gt; p rather than V -&gt; V. Second, I don&#x27;t know why the function fails to change the x value to 9 on the last line. That might simply be my ignorance of how RecordWildCards works.
 In general, are sum types of records a terrible idea? Will things break if some of the records have fields with the same name? I suppose name clashes could be addressed by defining the records separately in their own namespaces, and then putting them all together in the sum type. Finally, if there&#x27;s a particular reference that would be valuable for better understanding how records work in Haskell, I&#x27;d appreciate a pointer. But perhaps the manual is sufficient: https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/records.html
 Thank you.
 EDIT: On a bit of investigation, it appears that you can use the same field in multiple records in a sum type. The bigger issue appears to be when a field is only in one record. You can write code that isn&#x27;t type safe because it&#x27;s calling a record selector that works on one record type on a different record type. Unless that&#x27;s only ghci that lets you do that.

 Any chance anyone can share their findings? What did they gain from Rust? What did they miss from Haskell if anything? Was it worth it in the end and why? Etc.

                              <span>I believe that the best way to learn a programming language and its strengths is to get your hands dirty.
 So the past few days I have been trying to improve my problem solving skills using Haskell and I am learning a lot. I have mainly been looking at smaller exercises provided by Advent of Code. I believe these open ended problems provide a good basis for practice as I have a lot of freedom but in this freedom is also what I believe to be the largest pitfall as I can easily resort to thought patterns not meant for the functional paradigm. After working through some exercises I went back to Day 3 ( https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3 ) because when I first looked at it I had no clear idea of what Haskell could provide me in order to solve the problem in a streamlined manner, so I skipped …</span>

                              <span>I heard some of the web frameworks in Haskell is barebones so as a beginner idk if they&#x27;d be bad for me or maybe they&#x27;re good for me to learn Haskell language and how server side programming works, I&#x27;m not sure. Also I&#x27;m doing server side programming to learn web app pentesting, I wanted to understand how things worked in the backend and use that information to augment my web app pentesting studies. Which web framework will be the best fit for me?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently using emacs 27.1 at work (cannot install a newer version because we have a old fedora distribution for which no newer emacs exists). And I&#x27;d like to use the eshell more. According to this documentation https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/History.html i can search for a last used command by a regex with M-s, which does work. But the cycling through possible other commands via M-n and M-p doesnt work. I can see in a minibuffer, that it is cycling from &quot;history item 27&quot; to &quot;history item 31&quot; etc. but the command is not shown in the eshell. It just shows the first finding.
 Is this an acutal bug or am i getting something wrong? I&#x27;d prefer to use as few packages as possible and keep my dependencies low. So i really just need that eshell history.

                              <span>I would like to create a link in my dailies to my present note as soon as a date block (2024-05-23) is existing in my notes. I usually write with org-roam. I must admit, the division between my dailies and other notes is not well done... but it is how I am working now.
 I would like to have the possibility when the point is on a date (for instance 2024-05-22) to create a link in my dailies to the current heading, to the proper daily note if existing, or to a new daily note if not (under a predefined subheading)
 With the help of chatgpt (sorry, no dev here), I have this code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point () &quot;Create or open an Org-roam daily note for the date at point. If the daily note already exists, add a new heading.&quot; (interactive) (let ((date (or (thing-at-point &#x27;date) (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot; (org-read-date nil t))))) (if date (let ((parsed-date (org-read-date nil t date))) (org-roam-dailies-goto-date parsed-date) (when (derived-mode-p &#x27;org-mode) (goto-char (point-max)) (unless (bolp) (insert &quot;\n&quot;)) (insert &quot;* &quot;))) (message &quot;No date found at point.&quot;))))
 (define-prefix-command &#x27;org-roam-map) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c n&quot;) &#x27;org-roam-map)
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-roam (define-key org-roam-map (kbd &quot;d&quot;) &#x27;my-org-roam-dailies-goto-date-at-point)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 2 problems I see: 1. I want to use a keybinding when the point is on a date to create the link &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; I am not sure the latest part for the creation is OK and that the proper keymap is chosen
  
So far, instead of reading the date at point to create the daily note or insert the link into an existing one, it uses the function org-roam-dailies-goto-date which asks again for a date from the calendar. 
  
how would you improve this function? thanks for your ideas!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking I should give Emacs and Org Mode a shot. I really like Vim motions and Neovim has a headless mode which powers Firenvim and the VS Code Neovim extension, allowing Vim motions in textareas in those apps with Neovim as a backend. I think that would be better than using something like Evil mode which emulates Vim. If there isn&#x27;t a pre-existing solution, would it be worth learning Elisp and implementing it myself?

                              <span>Hi everybody, I &#x27;m an emacs noob. Recently I switch to vertico, consult, very happy with that.
 But I can&#x27;t find the way to create on-the-fly filter with them.
 For example:
 I run find-file then start type into minibuffer: foo
 I will show a list having 4 files has foo
 I want when I press C-c C-m, It would search content of that 4 file, then filter out the files have string bee in it&#x27;s content. (then the result will only have 2 files)
 Then I could press C-c C-n to reset result tobe 4 file as when I search foo before.
 Is that possible with vertico/consult or I have to use others like orderless, prescient.el?

                              <span>Please suggest to me some approaches to build a REPL CLI in Scala.
 I am thinking of using libraries like https://picocli.info or scallop https://github.com/scallop/scallop. But these will give you CLI facility, not REPL. Is there a library specific for REPL? It should support interactive CLI support such as dynamic filtering etc. Something seen while using oh-my-zsh
 Something similar in javascript - https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk for coloring
 Or I have to code it putting in infinite loop with some time waits or user interuptions ?
