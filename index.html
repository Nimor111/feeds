                    <span>Hello Everyone. I&#x27;m using Emacs everywhere - on my linux laptop and work mac laptop, and whenever I get a chance I&#x27;ll use my large monitor for better screen real estate. I&#x27;m determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.
 I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I&#x27;m not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).
 I&#x27;m just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type &quot;darwin&quot;). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.
 ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (&gt; (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list &#x27;initial-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-11&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-14&quot;))) 
 Then, it occurred to me that I&#x27;m not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?
 In the meantime, I&#x27;m off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won&#x27;t need to ask for this kind of help in the future. Much appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all, is there a variable or config I can set in emacs-dashboard that will use relative file paths? Right now I have both a windows and a linux emacs I&#x27;m trying to learn/use org-mode for and the Windows recentf file that&#x27;s storing the recent files to display uses absolute paths and it&#x27;s linked via a pcloud directory so it ruins the recents on my linux homedirectoy mirror.

 https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile
 https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens

 evil mode
 ​
 I also want to make something new for emacs.
 But i dont know how to start and not only start,
 I dont know how to make these projects production based. 
 I&#x27;m doing solely for community purpose to like emacs.
 I need your help.
 ​
 ​
 If you have made any emacs popular packages,
 would you please give me your story how you made it? 
 What resources did you followed to master it?
 Please provide a detail, which sites did you gone , which did you followed , 
 while learning to make packages and learn.
 ​
 ​
 I&#x27;m asking this because when i learn books on emacs, I would only know basic instead of making some project based practical extension, I will be stuck like i&#x27; here learning python and not making anything. 
 ​
 PLEASE HELP
 Thank you

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell itself and its development ecosystem. I&#x27;m trying to setup a Haskell Language Server for Neovim 0.5 (with native LSP support). Previously I was using CoC and HLS that I installed via ghcup and it worked just fine. Now with new version of Neovim I stopped using CoC and trying to make HLS work with native LSP. I have no idea on how to make my already installed HLS work together with native LSP, so I tried to install HLS via lspinstall plugin, but I always get the same error:
 ghcide compiled against GHC 8.10.5 but currently using 8.10.4 This is unsupported, ghcide must be compiled with the same GHC version as the project.
 I checked a version of &#x60;ghc&#x60; (with ghc -v) on my machine the output is:
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.5
 I also tried to create a new project with stack new ... to check if that issue persists there and it does.
 Does anybody have similar issues?
 If anybody could share his way of configuring Neovim LSP + HLS that would be great!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Played around with a nice TH tutorial posted here not a long ago.
 I&#x27;ve just copy-pasted relevant code snippets from the article - definitions for relevant generateTupleBoilerplate, generateTupleClass and generateTupleInstance - here is the source. Then in the main module used it for generating 62(current limit) type classes for tuples and their instances - source.
 My question: is that normal for such simple program GHC consumes really huge memory ~1.2 GiB at compilation, while full web-application project based on Servant takes about 400 MiB at max? Talking about RSS memory footprint, tested with GHC 9.0.1 . Either loading in ghci REPL or compiling with ghc -O makes no difference.
 Is this a known issue with TH extension or template-haskell package &amp; its dependencies?

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to build a Set with do-notation, ala []
 bars :: Set Bar basz :: Set Baz foos :: Set Foo foos &#x3D; do bar  (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b fmap &#x3D; Set.map return &#x3D; Set.singleton ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; mf &#x3D; Set.unions $ Set.map mf ma 
 And this makes everything work! Very cool, QualifiedDo doing QualifiedDo things. However, it&#x27;s clear that foo doesn&#x27;t require the full power of a monad. ApplicativeDo, here we come. Turn it on, implement some bindings
 pure &#x3D; Set.singleton ma  mb &#x3D; ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \f -&gt; Set.map f mb 
 and....bummer
 • Could not deduce (Ord (Baz -&gt; Foo)) arising from a do statement (maybe you haven&#x27;t applied a function to enough arguments?) 
 which unfortunately makes total sense. ApplicativeDo desugars into
 foos &#x3D; (\bar baz -&gt; mkFoo bar baz)  bars  bazs 
 which is trying to use fmap to make an intermediate Set (Baz -&gt; Foo). However, I cannot see a theoretical reason this could not desugar into this instead
 foos &#x3D; liftA2 mkFoo bars bazs 
 given a binding
 liftA2 :: Ord c&#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b -&gt; Set c liftA2 f as bs &#x3D; Set.map (uncurry f) (Set.cartesianProduct as bs) 
 So it seems like what I want to do is not unsound, but is not possible given how ApplicativeDo works. Am I wrong? If I am, what can I do? If not, has this limitation of ApplicativeDo been discussed anywhere else? Thanks!

                    <span>Reading Christian Tietze&#x27;s and Sascha Fast&#x27;s blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.
I figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain&#x27;s presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.
I decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.
From looking at his setup, I&#x27;d have to track the following:
Total from a year
Total from the first to the fourth quarters
Monthly average
Weekly average
Number of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it
Daily average
Number of days in which I get my daily average or above it
He tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.
My problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn&#x27;t talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?
Really appreciate any help you can give me.</span>

                    <span>I use a Tab Suspender module to hibernate pages and when that happens to Emacs help pages the suspended tabs don&#x27;t display the title anymore.
 The pages don&#x27;t seem to have A title tags. Could that be the reason why the suspended tabs loose the titles?

 Unicode CJK text (top) converted to PS file (bottom)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for CJK Unicode text. Now you can print CJK Unicode text using TrueType fonts (Google&#x27;s Noto Serif CJK font in the image) .
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>org-attach, for some reason, splits the ID into two parts before creating the path for your attachments:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no (org-attach-dir-from-id &quot;748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : /home/user/org/.attach/74/8ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Instead of something like this:
 /home/user/org/.attach/748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Is this the standard behavior or am I experiencing a bug? If this is the standard behavior, is there a reason behind it?
 EDIT:
 I found the function responsible for it and it seems intentional:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) &quot;Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.&quot; (format &quot;%s/%s&quot; (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2))) 
 But I&#x27;m still not sure why it is designed this way. Is there a special meaning to the first 2 characters of a UUID?

 When I started this journey I did not find much material on this topic so this is my reference guide after 1 month of experiments. The coolest part is obviously running emacs on it and connecting it with UNIX tooling.
 Hope you enjoy the read: https://www.lucacambiaghi.com/posts/ipad-main-computer.html

                    <span>I am switching to Programmer&#x27;s Dvorak and don&#x27;t yet have an ortholinear keyboard. The biggest pain point so far is that C-x is really annoying to reach, since it&#x27;s what was C-b on QWERTY. This means that many of my most frequent commands, such as C-x C-s, are a real stretch (QWERTY C-b C-;). How have any of the esteemed Dvorak emacsers reading this made peace with these C-x problems?

                    <span>Is there a function in lsp-mode, or ccls directly to find the compilation command associated with the file (if any) in the current buffer? If not, would another package (rtags, ede-compdb, irony-cdb) help query the compilation database without needing to use the rest of the package? The main use case is to plug it into other tools such as rmsbolt and templight that &quot;compile&quot; code to provide additional information.
 ccls-specific: Can the ccls cache for the current project be queried to obtain a list of all the files currently cached/indexed? If so, can it provide the compilation command associated with each of those files? This would help tremendously with header files in C++ or C.

                    <span>Hi all,
 After reading a lot of posts here and on other place in www I started using Caps and Return long-press as Ctrl. It&#x27;s really nice to have two Ctrl on my Mac without disrupting Caps and Return key. I am using Karabiner BTW to do it.
 This creates a new problem for me where if I press Ctrl with my pinky then it is really awkward to press save and close shortcuts (C-x C-s or C-x C-c). When Ctrl was in corner it was natural to use index and middle finger for those shortcuts but with Caps as Ctrl it feels a bit of stretch to use middle finger for s and index finger for x. That loweing the finger is also not very comfortable.
 Where am I going wrong with my finger placement?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a library for dealing with times and dates far in the past ~1200-1650 A.D.
 I&#x27;m familiar with time and hodatime, but they&#x27;re not really what I&#x27;m looking for.
 I&#x27;d like support for inputting/outputting Julian calendar and Muslim calendar dates, but that&#x27;s not strictly speaking necessary.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a new comer to PureScript, Haskell and other functional programming languages.
 I&#x27;m reading TaPL and want to implement a parser for the untyped lambda calculus in Part I.
 I want to parse the source code with its context which records the names of variables. In Parsec, the parser library in Haskell, there is a parameter u standing for the user-defined state type. On the other hand, there is no such parameter in Parser in purescript-parsing.
 Should I rewrite a parser library with states, or is there a good method to join states with parsers?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve just created two pairs of video/blog post that show you how you can prove the absence of an implicit/given instance at compile time.
 First pair in Scala 3 with the NotGiven feature: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HQojyuZK-Uo with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-givens/
 And the second pair in Scala 2 (and early versions of Scala 3.x with implicits), which is much more general (and more dangerous): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;m9LH0hvahcQ with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-implicits/

                    <span>Crazy question, but is there any way I can pipe the output from ansi-term directly into org mode to then format it on the fly into a table?
 I ask this because I often have to look at logs for work, and though &#x27;CSV-Mode&#x27; has helped for some logs, its not that great on an actual client&#x27;s backend system (CentOS).
 Would love to hear some thoughts on this because so far I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;Line-Mode&#x27; in ansi-term to just copy and paste, make tables on the fly with &#x27;C-c |&#x27; but thought maybe this could be done a bit easier and more direct INSIDE my org mode doc notes.
 ​
 Thanks!

                    <span>When I open a remote shell and try to type anything, there is a super long pause (10-15 sec) before autocomplete shows up. I tried disabling company-shell and company, and things return to normal when both are disabled.
 What&#x27;s going on that&#x27;s making it so slow?

                    <span>I use mu4e with Outlook email for work, and was informed that we would be moving mandatorily to Duo two-factor authentication.
 Apparently Duo is incompatible with IMAP, so I am considering my options.
 I wanted to check whether anyone has crossed this hurdle successfully and has any advice---thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a switch back to linux after quite a long time away (from before switching to emacs).
 Most stuff just worked but I have a few issues. Specifically right now the thing that is bugging me is different behavior for end-of-buffer. 
 On Mac OS I can jump to the end (or beginning) of a buffer with no issue. On linux the command works and appears to be the same (looked up via C-h k) but in addition to the jump it defines a region in the process. 
 It&#x27;s giving me the behavior that&#x27;s I&#x27;d get on my old machine if I set the mark then jumped. 
 If there&#x27;s a setting somewhere I&#x27;m not seeing it... any ideas?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve found all-the-icons-install-fonts to be ineffective under MacOS 11.2.3.
 I see emacs successfully installing font files under home and running fc-cache:
 $ ls -al ~/Library/Fonts/ ... -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 44732 Jul 8 21:06 all-the-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 489672 Jul 8 21:06 file-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 152796 Jul 8 21:06 fontawesome.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 128180 Jul 8 21:06 material-design-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 52544 Jul 8 21:06 octicons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 99564 Jul 8 21:06 weathericons.ttf 
 However, at runtime, those fonts are not picked up and garbled international characters are shown instead of the icons.
 The solution I found was to forcefully copy all these ttf files into /Library/Fonts(i.e., the system-wide font directory).
 Once in the system wide Fonts directory, emacs successfully picks up fonts with no troubles.
 Please advise if you know a cleaner solution.

                    <span>I wonder what happened to abo-abo, the author of ivy and swiper.
 Since 2015 he made at least one contribution on github, but since beginning of June there seems to be no activity. While this is usual for some users like me, it looks unusual for Oleh.
 I hope he is doing well.

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping this is a simple started project b/c my ELisp is a bit basic. If I&#x27;m biting off more than I can chew, please let me know. I&#x27;ve written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I&#x27;m okay, but I&#x27;m not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn&#x27;t depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn&#x27;t come with a REPL.
 I&#x27;m currently use Octave in a literate mode and it&#x27;s pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure&#x27;s case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.
 Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/
 The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like
 clj -Sdeps &quot;{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \&quot;0.11.935\&quot;}}}&quot; 
 Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.
 I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el
 It seems relatively straightforward - but I&#x27;m unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I&#x27;m okay if this only works on Linux)
 Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know. I don&#x27;t want to have to sink a month into this

                    <span>Howdy all!
 I wrote a WAV editor (GUI application) in Haskell which targets long-form narration audio. I&#x27;m releasing a public beta for it and thought I&#x27;d share here.
 It weighs in at ~9kloc and uses the SDL2 gaming lib for graphics and audio playback. The architecture uses a hybrid of OOP and functional techniques: the Model-View-Presenter pattern with FRP (via netwire) driving the UI interactivity.
 The codebase isn&#x27;t super polished and I&#x27;ve yet to write tests, so there&#x27;s bound to be cruft, but any feedback would be appreciated -- do let me know if I did anything exceedingly stupid (besides not writing tests yet, that is)!
 Resources:
  
osabe.app (consumer site)
 dev blog
 code repo
 @osabe_app on Twitter for release announcements, etc.
 @paul_schnapp on Twitter for dev discussion
  
There are a few things I could use some help with if anyone has the time and expertise:
  
There appears to be a slow memory leak with unevaluated thunks that I can&#x27;t nail down (I think somewhere in the Presenter, though possibly the Model)
 I&#x27;m having trouble nicely packaging the app with all the libs it needs on Mac

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on the effectful library and I&#x27;ve encountered that function of such shape is helpful for lifting monadic actions where m r shows in invariant position (e.g. like the unmask callback within mask).
 Hoogle search returns no results.
 The exact signature looks like this:
 withLiftH :: IOE :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; ((forall a b localEs. (IO a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; Eff localEs a -&gt; Eff localEs b) -&gt; Eff es r) -&gt; Eff es r 
 withLiftH is a working name, but perhaps there is a better name for this function?
 EDIT: Never mind, I realized this function is too permissive and will subtly break when misused with multiple threads (e.g. because you can happily use it to lift forkIO) considering the internal representation of Eff. My previous idea was a bit more complicated, but it&#x27;ll work reliably.
 I thought I could make the API a bit nicer, but this just won&#x27;t do.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s cut to the chase, I have been working with Javascript, Python and recently elixir. I found Elixir incredibly fun, easy to understand and much less verbose than using javascript. Recently I found watched escape from the ivory tower on the Haskell website and was more than intrigued. My concern is that, given that I only have limited time to dedicate to studying after work, should I work focus on Haskell or Elixir. Personally I would love to learn Haskell, but I want to make sure I learn something I will use, otherwise I won&#x27;t improve at it.

                    <span>Hello org-community,
 does anyone have a workaround/fix for the following issue:
 When exporting a document via the latex-backend footnotes inside of verse-blocks are not resolved correctly:
 #+begin_verse lorem ipsum dolor sit amet[fn::This is a footnote] #+end_verse 
 results in the .tex file as
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext[]{This is a footnote} 
 This has the irritating result that in the pdf the footnote is numbered with whatever  is given by the automatic export.
 The expected result would be (at least I think so)
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext{This is a footnote} 
 At the moment I&#x27;m stuck with deleting every [] argument – which works, but is obviously tedious.
 About the document: It is written in a report/book class, so numbering starts anew, when a new chapter is begun. otherwise it probably would stay unnoticed.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

 P.S.: User of Doom-emacs. But that shouldn&#x27;t matter.

                    <span>Greetings fellow orgonians,
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out if it&#x27;s possible to use org mode to represent repeating calendar events. In typical calendars, repeating events can be specified with rrules. However, while I see that org mode has repeaters, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to do several things that I can do with rrules.
 Examples:
 (1) repeat on the last day of every month
 (2) repeat on every 1st and 15th day of every month
 (3) repeat every Mon, Wed, Fri
 ​
 Is it possible to encode these repeat patterns in org mode? If so, how?
 If not, is there some extension package which enriches org mode with more sophisticated datetime patterns?
 Thanks in advance for any info you can offer!

                    <span>My personal keybindings, installed at Emacs start-up as a global minor mode, are numerous and a disorganized mess. That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. 
 I&#x27;m aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. 
 I&#x27;m also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so disliked. It&#x27;s essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can&#x27;t go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.
 An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. 
 Am I overlooking any packages? I&#x27;m facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I&#x27;ve never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is. Kudos to the Spacemacs folks, who have won so many converts to Emacs just as Magit and Org have. 
 I put my fate into the hands of r/emacs.

                    <span>I want to insert a link to a local file via a relative path so that the link still works on other computers my emacs project is synced with. 
 C-c C-l gives a list of options for inserting a link, and three of the options are &quot;file&quot;, &quot;file+sys&quot;, and &quot;file+emacs&quot;. Can anyone explain the differences between these three link types and which would be most portable?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I just concluded the first phase of work on a voice-control mode, serenade-mode. There&#x27;s not yet a demo video, but you can check out Serenade&#x27;s homepage to see what Serenade is capable of, it&#x27;s pretty impressive stuff. I&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback/code review on this since it&#x27;s my first mode, before I begin a Spacemacs layer that will extend it (I&#x27;m a Spacemacs/evil user, and outside that it hasn&#x27;t really been tested). Also, if anybody has suggestions or wants to contribute, that would be great!

                    <span>I use gnus, and I&#x27;ve been learning about org-capture. I like what I&#x27;ve seen several people do, which is to create a capture template for responding to emails. Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.
 It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.
 The &#x27;just as if...&#x27; is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don&#x27;t happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.
 Even if it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).
 I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?
 How might I do this? Any ideas would be great. TIA!

                    <span>I created a script to allow me to run multiple Emacsen on Mac. I basically create another folder in/Applications like Emacs1.app and link most things in from Emacs.app. I use a different icon for each Emacs so I can tell them apart. I like this arrangement because I can have only related files open in each Emacs or have different searches or find buffers in different Emacs apps. This of course can’t use emacsclient so you don’t get any boost starting Emacs but I don’t care since I leave them running for days or weeks. If anybody wants this script I can share it. I got the different icons from the Homebrew Emacs Plus project. If everyone thinks this is a stupid idea forget I said anything.

                    <span>buttondown.email is a newsletter service and is basically a better substack, there is some glitchyness (I think its only 1 dude working on it) but it is pretty great from my experience. However it only supports markdown. Thankfully it has a API (unlike substack) and Ive developed a solution that allows you to post any org-mode file you have.
 first make and save this python script I made (and probably put it into your PATH) and make it executable (chmod u+x org-buttondown.py) and install necessary dependencies (python-frontmatter and pandoc)

 I have run across a number laborious text editing operations recently that I thought could be solved elegantly with map and reduce concepts from functional programming. Does something like this already exist or is there a better way than what I am thinking?
 Task 1: 
 I like to write / edit in outline form - one bullet per sentence. A common task is to take a specific paragraph of text and split it by sentence into a bulleted list. 
 Task 2: 
 Conversely, the oposite task is to take a bulleted list at certain indentation level and collapse it back to a paragraph. 
 Task 3: 
 Consider that you want to extract all URLs from a buffer and concatenate them into list (one url per line)
 ​
 It occurs to me that the first two tasks could be solved efficiently if there was a flexible ma…</span>

                    <span>Hey Everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs for 2 months now, like it a lot. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. 
 I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. 
 The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. 
 The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.
 It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I&#x27;ve kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. 
 I&#x27;m curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? 
 Thanks, 
 -Hunter

                    <span>I wrote a recursive function that conceptually ought to work even though there&#x27;s no explicit base case. Specifically, successive elements of a finite data structure depend on (what should be) prior elements. 
 It type-checks and compiles, but when I try to run it in GHCI, it hangs for ~10s, throws a *** Exception: stack overflow, and then several seconds later GHCI is killed.
 There are a lot of things that could be undermining my assumptions.
 I understand that debugging these kinds of things is difficult in Haskell (for exactly the reasons good recursion is easy to do); I&#x27;m only on my first day with this problem. Are there normal strategies or tools for homing in on the cause?

                    <span>I have this simple type of Boolean expressions:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data BoolExp a &#x3D; BSelect a | BNot (BoolExp a) | BAnd [BoolExp a] | BOr [(BoolExp a)]
 instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; Show (BoolExp a) where show (BSelect a) &#x3D; show a show (BNot a) &#x3D; &quot;! &quot; ++ pwrap (show a) show (BAnd as) &#x3D; intercalate &quot; &amp; &quot; ( (pwrap . show)  as) show (BOr as) &#x3D; intercalate &quot; | &quot; ( (pwrap . show)  as)
 pwrap p &#x3D; &quot;(&quot; ++ p ++ &quot;)&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 My goal is to be able to parse them. I have written this code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import Text.Parsec import Text.Parsec.String import qualified Text.Parsec.Token as P import Text.Parsec.Language (emptyDef) import qualified Data.ByteString as B
 import Regex.Types
 lexer &#x3D; P.makeTokenParser emptyDef
 parens &#x3D; P.parens lexer braces &#x3D; P.braces lexer symbol &#x3D; P.symbol lexer natural &#x3D; P.natural lexer
 pSelect :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pSelect &#x3D; BSelect  fromIntegral  natural
 pAnd :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pAnd prsr &#x3D; BAnd  prsr sepBy1 (symbol &quot;&amp;&quot;)
 pOr :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pOr prsr &#x3D; BOr  prsr sepBy1 (symbol &quot;|&quot;)
 pNot :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pNot prsr &#x3D; BNot  ((symbol &quot;!&quot;) *&gt; prsr)
 pBool :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pBool &#x3D; try (pNot pBool)  try (pOr pBool)  try (pAnd pBool)  try (parens pBool)  pSelect &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I think the grammar I am trying to go for is self explanatory based on the code. However, this goes into a loop for most expressions, even parse pBool &quot;&quot; &quot;! 12&quot;. How can I fix this?

                    <span>Using kind-generics /u/Syrak was able to implement a generic implementation of TestEquality which can be used to derive instances for GADTs. It is not commonly known that this is even possible.
 This is what the TestEquality typeclass looks like, witnessing the equality of arguments:
 type TestEquality :: (k -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint class TestEquality f where testEquality :: f a -&gt; f b -&gt; Maybe (a :~: b) 
 By giving a kind-generic instance to Generically1 we are able to derive TestEquality A via Generically1 A, assuming GenericK Wit and GenericK SOrdering instances!

 How can I use newtype to wrap a existed data type in haskell? 
 As I read on https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns#evidence, they can wrap sort function to SortedList. They are using newtype and where can they use smart constructors? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I find imenu very helpful for quickly jumping back and forth between defuns in buffers containing lots of function definitions. However, when this command is invoked in an org-mode buffer, the relevant units cease to be defuns and become org headings instead. This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; * Section one
 +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-one () &quot;This is not a useful function.&quot;)
 +end_src
  
Section two
  
+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-two () &quot;This is not a useful function, either.&quot;)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.
 Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I&#x27;m describing? Alternatively, is there a similar command or package that provides this sort of functionality?

                    <span>Good day everyone!
 I&#x27;ve always been using scalamock with scalatest only, but now I&#x27;d like to optimize my tests by rewriting long running sequential scalatest suites to uTest. I&#x27;m using default scalatest MockFactory for my suite. I know that it&#x27;s supposed to work with scalatest only and I&#x27;ve seen in scalamock guide that you can implement your own MockFactoryBase and it should somehow work, but I didn&#x27;t really work for me(maybe I just understood guid wrong). 
 I create separate instance of the mock in every test context
 test(&quot;blah blah&quot;) {val myMock &#x3D; mock[TraitToMock] ...}
 Also my project is written using cats-effect, so I&#x27;m running tests also with it&#x27;s IO 
 And in process I faced multiple issues such as:
 java.util.ConcurrentModificationException: mutation occurred during iteration
 It seems it&#x27;s because in UnorderedHandler(which is used in my tests) handle method they&#x27;re using synchronization, but in parent Handler class operations with handlers are not synchronized.
 https://preview.redd.it/7sflfd9ud0a71.png?width&#x3D;1448&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;8eae336304b348946886066c1214c950229c0b71
 https://preview.redd.it/0nglptufe0a71.png?width&#x3D;1334&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;0db3228a4f760d921e495a122ef8c6350364d995
 Wrapping this methods in synchronization helps and tests don&#x27;t fail. But it seems like this fix is not the best solution.
 If I&#x27;m not getting exception listed above, I get like intersection of mock contexts, mocks handle each other expectations. Something like that
 https://preview.redd.it/8wsgaq0ai0a71.png?width&#x3D;3426&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;16b8b9df369e699b5aac7679518fab8cd3b2cc36
 So maybe someone knows how to make scalamock work with utest properly? Maybe I missed something important or overcomplicate things and much easier solution exists? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hi,
 I am not a full-time developer/coder. But I have been coding for the last ~17 years.
 I have mainly used java. For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.
 Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.
 I don&#x27;t have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.
 Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?
 My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. 
 Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 
 tagging /u/makingthematrix 
 Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.
 ​
 Thanks a tonne

                    <span>The design of a library like linear-base, Tweag’s standard library for Haskell’s
linear types, requires many choices.
One of these choices for linear-base is what a linear Traversable
type class should look like.
One way I use to approach such problems
is to implement instances for the types in GHC.Generics.
GHC.Generics provides a way to implement datatype-generic functions by translating a datatype to and from
a limited set of primitive datatypes representing sums, products, constants, etc.
Therefore, a type class implemented for this set can be given an
instance at a large class of algebraic datatypes.
So this is a nice way to apply structural reasoning to a problem.
The problem
Here is the signature of fmap in linear-base, as it applies, for instance, to lists:

This is probably a dramatic example, but I daily run into overzealous highlighting, or maybe I should say overzealous searching on my part.
I understand this is meant to be helpful, and sometimes it is. When it is, it is indispensable. When it&#x27;s not, it is an eyesore making it hard to read the zettel.
Will the new MMD editor have this same behavior?</span>

                    <span>Hey all,
I built a small tool for myself and wanted to share it with you  

Context:
Up until recently I sent those to myself in Telegram where it creates a nice preview image of the link, which makes it a lot easier to remember what the link was about.
Solution:
Let me know what you think (maybe I am also the only one who had this kind of problem)


You can find it at link-previews.stephanbogner.de
FYI: It&#x27;s also on ProductHunt

                    <span>After reading so many threads full of thoughtful and in-depth responses, I thought its was finally time to introduce myself. Greetings!
I have kept a paper zettelkasten for the past six months or so, which has benefitted from everyone&#x27;s discourse and guidance here. So, thank you all! I hope to contribute a meager offering now and then to this already robust discussion forum.
Related to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.
The subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It&#x27;s true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that&#x27;s probably why I chose a paper system.
I also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I&#x27;d like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.
Anyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone&#x27;s expertise! Cheers!</span>

                    <span>I installed which-key today to discover available key bindings. Problem is, if I type C-x, which key shows some bindings in the mini buffer, which often does not fit there, and it shows 1/3 (page 1 of 3). But how do I get to page 2 or 3? If I click on the mini buffer or click on the scroll bar of mini buffer, or type anything else, the mini buffer disappears! What to do?
 Update: After further observation, I noticed two things:
  
I was wrongly using the next page command. I should have been using &#x27;C-h n C-h n&#x27; to get to third page of which-key popup window instead of &#x27;C-h n n&#x27;
 
However, if I use C-h, when the which-key popup window opens up now with available key binding information, it has now two pages, and I cannot use &#x27;C-h n&#x27; to get to the 2nd page. As soon as I type C-h, emacs interprets it as me invoking C-h C-h and reacts accordingly. How do I solve this case?

                    <span>I am using use-package and I am trying to defer the loading of some packages from my init.el. If I understand correctly, this requires that I specify the commands that are to be autoloaded in a :commands block. For some modes, I have found that this is easy and it works. However, for some modes like geiser, I&#x27;ve tried specifying the obvious entry points (e.g. geiser, run-geiser, and geiser-repl) but portions of geiser are still loading and being shown in the features variable. Is there a way to determine what is causing these features to be loaded? I have tried with :defer set both to t and nil with no effect. Perhaps one complication is that geiser already defines some autoload functions (none of which should be called during initialization, I think) and I am not sure how those interact with :commands and :defer.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been recently playing with org-web-tools and Elisp in general. I&#x27;m completely a Elisp noob and that&#x27;s why I hope to get more information here. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to to use org-capture to create a custom template (not for ORG mode). What I&#x27;d like to have is following:
 * [[%site-title|site-url]] 
 I&#x27;ve found this function which will create an ORG link using org-web-tools:
 ;; https://blog.lazkani.io/posts/text-editors/bookmark-with-org-capture/ (defun org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url () &quot;Extend &#x3D;org-web-tools-inster-link-for-url&#x3D; to take URL from clipboard or kill-ring&quot; (interactive) (org-web-tools--org-link-for-url (org-web-tools--get-first-url))) 
 That function I can use in my org-capture templates like this:
  (&quot;b&quot; &quot;Bookmark (Clipboard)&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/work/sync/org/bookmarks.org&quot; &quot;Bookmarks&quot;) &quot;** %(org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:TIMESTAMP: %t\n:END:\n%?&quot; :prepend t) 
 However how can I modify org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url to create a new string like I&#x27;ve mentioned above. The function should return 
 * [[%site-title|s%site-url]] 
 for a given URL in the clipboard. Thanks in advance.

                    <span>In the past previous years, I have tried variety of ways to boost emacs start up time.
  
server + emacsclient
 use-package to defer package loading
 change GC threshold to large value in init.el
 manipulate pdump
 native-comp
  
So far I was able to load most packages without defer in 1s. I was pretty happy.
 Until today, I saw a startup summary function from https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/
 (message &quot;*** Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections.&quot; (format &quot;%.2f seconds&quot; (float-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time))) gcs-done) 
 Then it reports
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.84 seconds with 40 garbage collections. 
 The 40 GCs don&#x27;t quite make sense since I have changed my GC threshold early on in init.el
 Then I tried the following in my early-init.el
 (setq gc-cons-threshold 8000000) ;; ~8MB 
 The number improves to
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.48 seconds with 5 garbage collections. 
 For an example, loading evil changes from
 Loading package evil...done (0.125s) 
 to
 Loading package evil...done (0.064s) 
 Of course, you can further increase GC threshold, but it won&#x27;t make too much impact.
 ​
 So, I finally find a good use case for early-init.el . And here sharing with here. It would be interesting to see if it works for other fellows.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I wanted to share a little package I wrote called preview-org-html-mode. It provides a configurable live preview of an org mode exported to HTML using the xwidget browser in Emacs. I wrote this for personal use but decided to continue to improve my elisp skills.
 Please give it a try if you&#x27;re interested! Still a work-in-progress but it is good enough for my uses. I would also really appreciate any elisp/code suggestions, there are a lot of silly things I think I did in the code but I really don&#x27;t know better and am trying to learn.
 Hope this helps someone, and if not here&#x27;s a fun chance to pick apart some sub-par elisp (please, go for it!)

 And yes, I can see how some people might not find this useful, but I enjoy using it in some special cases I find myself in. Use in good health.

 Literally the first line:
 &quot;slimhtml is now part of Org, included in GNU Emacs, future bug reports or contributions should be sent to Org directly. &quot; 
 First of all I am emacs noob.
 ​
 I cant find it anywhere, its not in org-export-backends, its not in org export dispatch menu.

                    <span>Not sure if this is possible or not, but I vaguely remember having seen it done in a literate config a while ago.
 E.g. I have something like the table below. Would it be possible to run through it to :bind the keybings or something similar?
 | Key name | Operation | |----------------+--------------------------------| | ~M-~ | Move between windows | | ~M-x ~ | Swap buffer between windows | | ~C-~~ | Next window (key above TAB) | | ~C-TAB~ | Cycle through buffers with IVY | | ~C-x k~ | Kill THIS buffer | | ~C-x +~ | Balance the sizes of windows | 
 I&#x27;m quite unfamiliar with org-mode still, so apologies if this is something obvious or if I&#x27;m explaining things poorly.

 This sentence made me interested in scala. 
 I know it is just a series and it is not necessary that it will have a relation with the real world, but, it just makes me curious.
 So, can anyone explain the relevance of the sentence in the real world?

                    <span>In the excitement around Scala 3, I&#x27;m curious to get a sense of what the norms are (or likely to be) for backend web development at your company (for those who use Scala at work). Or simply - what would you recommend?
 From what I&#x27;ve explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.
 How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?
 In a similar vein, what&#x27;s your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).
 I&#x27;m also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I&#x27;ve read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.
 Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?
 My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.
 Warm thanks!

                    <span>Hi All, so i am reading the red book, part 4 about the effects &amp; I/O. So after reading most of the chapters. I think I got an understanding of IO monad, please comment about it to solidify my understanding .
 So an IO Monad provides methods to execute side effects. so i can use those provided methods for sequencing computations, that depend on side effect ( reading data / writing data ) . More like a effects interface / type class.
 ​
 Thank You

                    <span>This is a response to Will&#x27;s Zettel Sharing ... and the interesting interactions which are happening there.
I don&#x27;t have a Zettelkasten, yet (not sure if I ever will have).  I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.
I did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  &quot;What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?&quot;.
I think that I understand, from what I&#x27;ve read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.
The basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; resonates with me.  I&#x27;m just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.  Maybe this already exists (Yahoo groups, Discord, Discourse, Reddit, etc.)?
Just wondering if anyone else has any similar thoughts.</span>

                    <span>Does someone have a solution for tab (not alt-tab) to complete in cc-mode with completion at point functions? I use eglot for completion sources and it correctly sets completion at point functions
 completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in minibuffer.el. Value in # (eglot-completion-at-point t) 
 But c-tab-always-indent doesn&#x27;t respect the same logic as tab-always-ident which when set to &#x27;complete first indents if necessary and then completes via emacs builtin completion at point mechanims, so works fine in, say, emacs lisp mode. Can I get this same &quot;tab indents then completes&quot; functionality in c/cc modes?
 ​
 Thanks for any pointers.

                    <span>Hello, all.
 I am new to emacs and am trying to figure out if it&#x27;s possible to use emacs as a sort of textual interface (e.g. text and ascii graphics) to a graph database. 
 The interface would need to be bidirectional in the sense that I could run certain commands and type certain things into the interface (although be constrained to not be able to type arbitrary text since not all text would correspond to a graph) and have the graph database be updated according to what I had entered, but also, if some external program updated the graph database, the displayed textual representation should be updated as necessary.
 Example:
 The graph has the nodes and edges: A node has an ID which is automatically generated upon its creation, a possibly empty string name, and a possible empty list of la…</span>

                    <span>Hey there,
 Was wondering if the following was possible:
 - If someone had to make a TODO list in Org-Mode, but be able to export the live changes to a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for their boss to review and make related edits within Google Sheets, is this possible?
 I know org-babel and Pandoc exist, and would be able to export things nicely.
 I just didn&#x27;t know if Emacs had any Google Sheet integration with live spreadsheets somehow.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Fellow emacsers. 
 After researching into ergonomic split keyboards and keyboard customizations (I will probably buy a keyboardio model 100), I&#x27;m playing with the idea of trying key chords in emacs, but found not much about it in the wild wild web. 
 In this case key chords means 2 simultaneously pressed keys without modifiers as in https://github.com/emacsorphanage/key-chord.
 Those chords can be mapped to any command, so for example, in Spanish gh is a very uncommon pair. So we could map that to save-buffer, making it faster and easier (in a Dvorak layout) than C-x C-s.
 Does any of you tried it? If you did, what worked for you and what didn&#x27;t? 
 As always, thank you very much for your time, attention and knowledge sharing... :)
 PD: edited to make it clearer what &quot;chording&quot; means in this question. Thanks /u/7890yuiop :)

 If your font supports unicode table symbols, you can have a table (M-x table-insert) with smooth edges.

                    <span>I am an emacs noob, I am following the built-in tutorial and I have a problem with &quot;M-&quot; which is supposed to &quot;Kill the word immediately before the cursor&quot;. When I press &quot;M-&quot; (meaning &quot;Alt-Backspace&quot;), it deletes the next character after the cursor instead. I.e. on my Linux system with emacs 26.3, &quot;M-&quot; does the same thing as &quot;C-d&quot;.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 26.3 in Windows 10 (I work in a Windows intensive environment, and I had to give up the struggle of using Linux). And just this morning, for no reason that I can see, the second command C-f in a command sequence fails to register. 
 For example, I was editing a LaTeX file using AucTeX, which has C-x C-f C-e for entering emphasized text. But the second command key, the C-f, couldn&#x27;t be entered. Emacs stopped at C-x and refused to accept another command key. 
 I closed Emacs down and restarted, and entered C-x C-f to access a file, and again, the C-f wouldn&#x27;t register. It&#x27;s not a problem with my keyboard: the f key works fine (see this post?) and the only changes to my .emacs file have been some minor font changes for font-lock-mode. 
 It seems to involve only C-f. Other sequences do work: C-x C-b for example, or C-x C-s. But C-x C-f is a sequence I use a lot, and I have no idea why it&#x27;s not working. Any ideas? Thanks!

                    <span>The key bindings in Doom Emacs are sometimes unexpected. For example, the undo command in M-x calc is mapped to lowercase u, instead of the usual uppercase U.
 M-x which-key-show-top-levelshows that key binding on page 2 of 8, but I found it accidentally.
 https://preview.redd.it/dcymg45u5i971.jpg?width&#x3D;1405&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;58f4621a3a160971399a8d8424cce76a1f8ab8a6
 Is there a way to / search the top-level key bindings, without having to manually go through all 8 pages (via C-h j)?
 More generally, how can I find the most relevant (&quot;context sensitive&quot;) key bindings? The usual C-h m is not too helpful in Doom Emacs (M-x calc) , as it simply shows the original key binding, followed by &quot;that binding is currently shadowed by another mode&quot;.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a student, and after learning Haskell in a club last year and using it extensively in a side project recently, I feel like it&#x27;s currently the language I&#x27;m most comfortable with. As I prepare to apply for internships for next summer, I&#x27;m wondering if it would be a bad idea to prepare for leetcode-style questions in Haskell.
 Does anyone have experience using it in a &quot;regular&quot; internship interview? (By regular I mean ones where you don&#x27;t expect to use any Haskell in the job.)
 I guess I&#x27;m worried that either the interviewer will just decline to let me use the language, or otherwise let me but still have a negative view of it. In that case I could offer to use a more mainstream language, but I&#x27;d be less practiced in it.
 But I also think using Haskell and it&#x27;s type system helps me tremendously in thinking through difficult problems, so in that way I could see it as an advantage.
 Any advice from either side (interns or interviewers) would be great. Thanks!

                    <span>I am happy to announce the first release of https://hackage.haskell.org/package/typeable-mock
 Its goal is to make mocking functions possible in the context of any monad and with as little boilerplate as possible.
 It is inspired by how easy mocking is in the Python or JS. The mocks are dispatched dynamically by name and type. Only the call site and the test cases are aware of a mock, so the changes are small and never require restructuring of the application for testing.
 I wrote it to make writing tests more enjoyable and I hope you enjoy it too!
 PS: [ANN #2] to record the arguments of the function calls and expecting calls, typeable-mock needs to process the arguments and result of arbitrary functions. The solution turned out to be more general than mocks needed, so I published it as a separate library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/variadic-function

                    <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m trying to obfuscate some data in a dataset to practise Haskell and I&#x27;m running into some difficulties, particularly with regards to memoisation.
 The dataset contains some IP addresses which I want to anonymise by shuffling the last octet (e.g., mapping 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.231) and some email addresses, where I want to tokenise the username (e.g., mapping alice@gmail.com to v38j8a@gmail.com, where v38j8a is just a string generated randomly). Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.
 I&#x27;ve written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I&#x27;m trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I&#x27;m running into difficulty - as I&#x27;m making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I&#x27;m working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -&gt; Int function but not an Int -&gt; IO Int.
 Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn&#x27;t great and it&#x27;s unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; using unsafePerformIO, but I can&#x27;t immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.
 Thanks very much for any help.
 Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs

                    <span>I love emacs and org-mode. However, this video on jupyter still blew me away. I have been thinking of how to make the interaction possible in emacs/org-mode, but couldn&#x27;t. 
 (EDIT not just backend-ed by emacs but to have the interaction in emacs)
 Any ideas? Perhaps we need to wait for nyxt to be fully developed..

                    <span>Hey
 I would like to convert some org-mode files to markdown (for easy viewing on Bitbucket), but seems as
 pandoc -o x.md x.org 
 misses some of the org-formatting, eg. images are not included.
 There are many ways to do the things in org-mode, maybe I am just doing it in a &quot;wrong&quot; way. How do you convert from org to md?
 Image example 1:
 #+CAPTION: Image caption #+NAME: fig:image\_name #+ATTR\_HTML: :width 100% #+ATTR\_ORG: :width 100% file:files/my_img.jpg 
 Image example 2:
 [[files/my_img_2.jpg]]

                    <span>For some reason, you cannot choose Scala as a language from the drop down menu when you try to submit. However, the Kattis website nevertheless has this site
 https://open.kattis.com/help/scala
 which makes me believe it should be possible to submit Scala files. Choosing Java as a language does not seem to work for me.
 Update: According to Kattis support, they have a full Scala implementation that is currently disabled due to the performance of Scala programs.

                    <span>(This is a release announcement written as a cautionary tale about the dangers of building your own tools...)
 So I was working through the Roguelike tutorials...
 Field of view in a roguelike
 ...and thought the engine performance could be better - quite normal - every time I build a new type of game I find new ways that Indigo could be better. Tweaked Indigo to change how it deals with large arrays destined for the GPU. While I was there I fixed some other stuff ...and also added the ability to dynamically load shaders. Here are the release notes:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.9.0
 That allowed me to simplify the Roguelike Starterkit and make it faster (if anyone is following along, upgrade!):
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit
 ...but with the new dynamic shader loading I realised I could also solve another problem I&#x27;d been wondering about: How to share live Indigo shader demos?
 Thought it would be fun to have a little website that rendered Indigo flavoured shaders from GitHub gists (no backend, GitHub does the storage, easy peasy...), but website building for me means using Tyrian (an Elm-like web framework), and that also needed an upgrade:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.2.0
 ...but I did eventually build the site:
 https://purplekingdomgames.github.io/shadergist/?gist&#x3D;davesmith00000/5a6b585dbc2184a2c215b16a91234c22
 And thus all the yaks were shaved. Back to game building.

                    <span>Wire Signals is a small event-handling library. It started as a part of the Wire Android codebase. About two thirds of Wire Android is written in Scala, making it unique among Android apps - most of them being implemented in Java and/or Kotlin. Wire is a messenger and as such it must be very responsive: it has to quickly react to any events coming from the backend, as well as from the user, and from the Android OS itself. Most, if not all of the available solutions focus on the backend, so we developed our own implementation of event streams and &quot;signals&quot; - special event streams with caches holding the last propagated value. They proved to be a very flexible and concise way of handling events. During the last we moved that code to a separate repository, rewrote it, added more tests, added …</span>

 The txt file has records for each country, new cases, new deaths each day, date, total number of deaths etc.
 I&#x27;m struggling to find a way to display the results. I have searched online and found that the basic step would be to something similar to:
 import scala.io.Source
 val lines &#x3D; Source.fromFile(&quot;/Users/Al/.bash_profile&quot;).getLines.toList
 How can I extract specific record from txt file? Any kind of help would be appreciated thankyou

                    <span>I&#x27;m working with akka-stream and would like to define a Flow that takes some data from a Source and writes each record to another system. After all of the records have been written, I need to call a close() method. I&#x27;m running the stream with .runWith(Sink.ignore), and I&#x27;d like to ensure the runWith Future completes only after the close() method has completed.
 So far I&#x27;ve found two ways that seem like they could work with Flows: alsoToMat and watchTermination. In both cases, the runWith Future completes before the close method has completed.
 I&#x27;ve gotten it to work by using .toMat, but this turns the Flow into a Sink. I&#x27;d prefer to keep it as a Flow if possible.
 I wrote this up as an example App on Scastie: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/baWl6EB7TkSjL7DMV2ZX5Q/2
 I appreciate that identifying the last element of a stream is a tricky problem. 
 It seems like there is some precedent for making this kind of thing work. For example, it seems that the FileSource can close a file handle before the full stream has completed. FileSource is implemented as a more complicated custom graph stage. I&#x27;d prefer to avoid that if possible, but I don&#x27;t mind doing it if necessary.

                    <span>Hello! I&#x27;m currently working through a course that posts its material publicly online, and am working through the longest increasing subsequence problem. This problem is a little different than usual because it wants you to return a sequence and not just the length. I feel like I found the length in an efficient way, using dynamic programming. But because I am new to scala and not that great at algorithms, I don&#x27;t think I constructed the subsequence efficiently. Here is my code: 
 /* * Assignment: Longest increasing subsequence * * Sequences are a natural source of computational problems. One such * family of problems involves finding subsequences with specified * properties in a given sequence. This exercise asks you to write * a program that, given a sequence * * s(0), s(1), ..., s(n-1) …</span>

                    <span>I finally got around to finishing this and sticking it on Maven Central, and by finishing it I mean I decided on a whim to start over from scratch a couple days ago and somehow ended up with a better library than I had before. 
 https://github.com/ciaraobrien/dottytags
 It&#x27;s as close as I could get to a straight clone of ScalaTags with the twist that everything is done with macros at compile-time, so it reduces the runtime processing to mostly just concatenating literal strings with a few dynamic strings in an Array with a StringBuilder, with the upshot being that it&#x27;s between 2 and 10 times faster at runtime than ScalaTags (which is already quite quick) depending on the exact nature of the workload it&#x27;s given.

                    <span>Sharing this awesome helper function I came across here: re-builder-query-replace-this 
 when bound to a key in the re-builder window can go straight into regexp query replace (as described in the post). 
 One thing which would make it nicer imo is for the re-builder window to quit after the query replace is done -- currently, after the query replace finishes one is left in the target window with the replacement still highlighted so one has to switch to the re-builder and then quit the re-builder. I tried raising the save-excursion call before selecting the target window but that isn&#x27;t cutting it - anyone know a simple/clean way without hardc-oding buffer names and such?
 for reference, here is the unaltered function def:
  (defun reb-query-replace-this-regxp (replace) &quot;Uses the regexp built with re-builder to query the target buffer. This function must be run from within the re-builder buffer, not the target buffer. Argument REPLACE String used to replace the matched strings in the buffer. Subexpression references can be used (\1, \2, etc).&quot; (interactive &quot;sReplace with: &quot;) (if (eq major-mode &#x27;reb-mode) (let ((reg (reb-read-regexp))) (select-window reb-target-window) (save-excursion (beginning-of-buffer) (query-replace-regexp reg replace))) (message &quot;Not in a re-builder buffer!&quot;)))

                    <span>As far as I can tell, there is no pre-defined face for categories in agenda views. Instead the category just uses the same face as the header text, i.e. org-scheduled-today, org-scheduled-previously, etc..
 Is there any way that I could customize the category face in agenda views?
 Category are distinct agenda elements, so it is possible to perhaps create a face for them?
 By the way, I often use org-super-agenda. I don&#x27;t think org-super-agenda can handle this issue, but I am not very familiar with its line formatting capabilties.

                    <span>The doc says ob-js would support sessions out of the box. However if I just create a code block
 #+begin_src js :session console.log(&quot;hi!&quot; #+end_src 
 It will complain that node will not support sessions. What can I do? How would I change the evaluation backend to something that does?

                    <span>Since pcre2el got quite some attention lately.
 Has someone played/experimented with emacs-pcre? 
 emacs-pcre uses libpcre, nicely compiles, works and gives the complete Perl Compatible RegEx feature set (as opposed to pcre2el) to emacs.
 Sadly the (user) commands, which would make emacs-pcre convenient are completely missing from the package.
 This is sad, because all the power those missing user commands could give.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve understood continuations for years in the sense that I know they have something to do with control-flow, they form a monad, they&#x27;re very powerful, etc. But I never really had a strong understanding of them in the sense that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to write my own continuation monad without using a reference for all the operations. The sort of thing where I would only really ever use continuations if I&#x27;m using do-notation to package them up. I just didn&#x27;t see how they worked under the hood.
 Recently I was re-reading Wadler&#x27;s comprehending monads, which has a nice section on the continuation monad and how to translate to CPS for both call-by-value and call-by-name. In particular, I was translating his monad comprehensions all the way down to their respective continuations. This lead me to r…</span>

                    <span>Hi, it&#x27;s me again. I&#x27;m now looking for a senior Haskell dev to join my team at Standard Chartered bank, in London.
 My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. For this role we expect hands-on experience with a couple of large Haskell / OCaml projects, and/or managing a team.
 Feel free to reach out to me directly if you&#x27;re interested and have any questions, but applications should go via this link: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100017588
 A more junior role that I advertised before, also in London, is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100012204
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.

                    <span>Hi all!
 I just published (on Hackage) my first ever Haskell library, StrongPath, which provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time than standard FilePath (well, String).
 It is heavily inspired by path library, which we used in Wasp-lang a lot and loved it, but then we wanted even more type safety so I ended up creating StrongPath.
 I still consider myself relatively new to writing production-level Haskell code so I would appreciate more experienced among you taking a look and giving some advice on what could be improved!
 Source code: https://github.com/wasp-lang/strong-path
 Some specific things I would love to get a second thought on:
 1. I ended up with a lot of duplication / boilerplate in the code, repeating same / similar logic …</span>

                    <span>Hi guys, newbie here!
 I&#x27;m into a research internship based on Haskell for my master&#x27;s degree. Short version: we would like to work on an implementation for a linear type system (https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/linear-types/roadmap). 
 First question: I&#x27;ve been studying Haskell for a few months and I&#x27;m trying to go deep into the GHC. What is the starting point? You have any good resources for a better understanding of what it does?
 Second question: this is the first time that I try to &quot;extend&quot; a compiler. I&#x27;m excited but also a bit scared. What is the &quot;protocol&quot;? There is something that i should know? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>Hello there,
 I want to share a small library with you. Please go ahead and roast it.
 Its a linked list with size completely determined at compile time.
 It is of limited practicality, but you can do some cool stuff.
  
Compile error when accessing head or tail of empty list.
 
Compile error when .get at index greater than size.
 
You can only zip with list of same size.
 You can split a list, and you get two lists each of which has the correct size.
 Concatenation of lists results in list with correct size.
 
 
cats.Traverse instance
  
Cross compiled for 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to run a small migration program to move my data from You need a budget to GNU cash. I found a program that can do the migration. I can get it to run but I ran into an exception. Which I think is wrong.
 The exception is being thrown against the line below
 D01/08/2017 T-575.00 PInlingua M N CR LMonthly Bills:education 
 It&#x27;s throwing based on the last case. In the file below https://github.com/galbarm/YNAB4toGnuCashMigrationTool/blob/master/src/main/scala/YNABTransaction.scala 
 The case: 
 case _ &#x3D;&gt; assert(L.exists(_.startsWith(&quot;Income:Available&quot;)), s&quot;payee transaction must have an income category: $this&quot;) 
 I&#x27;ve never used scala or java really but is that saying L should start with Income:Available if the payee exists?

                    <span>I understand that Zettels should be about one thought, and that if you create a Zettel about an idea but already have a Zettel about the idea, you should incorporate the details from the new Zettel into the old one.
However, I&#x27;m in doubt about how to best handle in-text citations. E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:
Some description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].

The steps:

1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].
2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].
3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].
4. do b [citekey2].

You do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].

I ask:
If I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?
In general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don&#x27;t question what I do like in the scenario described?
I appreciate your comments in advance.</span>

                    <span>Hi,
 I vaguely remember seeing a library which used the YouTube API to convert a playlist/channel and turn it into a set of Org headlines, did I imagine it, if not I guess I&#x27;ll have to write it!

                    <span>Hi guy so recently I learnt about Emacs and wanted to give it a go mostly for fun but also cause I would like to use org-mode to boost my productivity and manage to focus, so as the title says I&#x27;m a non programmer I&#x27;ve written some code in c# but not full time and mostly for curiosity. So far I&#x27;ve downloaded doom Emacs and dabble a bit with it but I cannot even install org-bullets to change the asterisk in org-mode... so yeah i guess that says a lot I hope you guys can point me to the right track thanks in advance

 Is it me or any one of you guys experience the same? Btw, I am starting to really appreciate emacs keybindings.

                    <span>I am having a hard time understanding how this simple function works: fibs &#x3D; 0:1: zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
 I know that this should be trivial for seasoned Haskell programmers but I have looked at a few folks explanation of the particular recursion that the function has but I am unable to get the concept. Can someone please help?

                    <span>I currently have to decide whether to go to Charlmers University or Utrecht University for my master&#x27;s. And I feel like I do not have enough knowledge to base that decision on. Have you done your bachlor&#x27;s at Utrecht University and you master&#x27;s at Charlmers University or the other way around or your PhD? I would love to have a chat. Let me know when you have time, please.
 EDIT: Maybe I should mention why I ask this question here. These are the two EU universities most closely connected to functional programming, static type systems, and Haskell that I could find.

                    <span>I&#x27;m disturbed by the Haskell Foundation accepting sponsorship from IOHK, a company incorporated in Hong Kong.
 The recent suppression of free speech and democratic activism in Hong Kong has been condemned publicly by the leaders of many Western nations, including the USA, UK and Australia. The arrests conducted under this new law seem arbitrarily targeted, and many commentators have described them as being directed by President Xi personally, to suppress dissent.
 However, IOHK is still incorporated in Hong Kong, despite being (to use their own description) &quot;a fully decentralised remote working organisation&quot;. IOHK appears to be well-funded, having (again, from their website) &quot;400+ people across 50+ countries&quot;, and therefore would appear to have had every opportunity to leave Hong Kong, if they did not support the actions of the CCP.
 In the past, people on this subreddit have loudly and forcefully condemned US-based companies like Facebook, and US defense contractors, for their use of Haskell, and have stated they would not work for those companies.
 Is anyone else equally disturbed by this funding arrangement for the Haskell Foundation? At what point would it become disturbing to accept money from a remote company that is happily headquartered in an authoritarian regime?

                    <span>Hello, I apologize for a rather long post.
 I&#x27;m trying to improve my haskell understanding and was attempting re write of go code that I did few weeks ago. my current best implementation is taking about 500% of go code, and I&#x27;m looking for ways to improve wall clock time for haskell script.
 task is to parse 2 text files, and comparing their content. format of files is
 DOCID_{num}\t{num}\t{num0},{f0} {num1},{f1} ..... {numN},{fN}\n 
 It&#x27;s mainly a repost of https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/263682/parsing-custom-text-file-using-haskell/263731#263731 , where I&#x27;m trying to get haskell code wall clock time as close to golang as possible
 Edit1: Adding algorithm for the code for completeness .
 to perform this comparison efficiently I have sorted both input files based on numeric…</span>

                    <span>Hey everybody, after having built some web applications with Scala/Scala.js, we started stripping common functionality out into a reusable template.
 While this is similar to bootzooka, the main difference is the tech stack.
 For anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried building web apps in Scala.js, let me tell you that it is a lovely experience, having worked with several JavaScript frameworks before, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Scala.js + Slinky (React) + Scalablytyped.
 There is still lots of stuff to do but if we focus on getting it perfect, we wouldn&#x27;t get to a release date ever.

                    <span>Greeetings from a newbie.
Today, I see the Devonthink for Historians Youtube channel posted some thoughts about keeping a Zettelkasten.
Being new to the way of the Zettel, I don&#x27;t know if their ideas match well with the Zettelkasten community.
It was interesting to hear them talk about &quot;evolutionary sifting,&quot; which I think is probably similar to the Zettelkasten Boy Scout rule, leaving notes better than you found them.
Anyway, if it&#x27;s of interest -  .</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t like that I have to choose between using the easy to use minor modes like &#x60;display-battery-mode&#x60; and &#x60;lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable&#x60; versus setting &#x60;modeline-format&#x60;. I still want the info from lsp-modeline for example, I just want to tweak the spacing and such of the modeline.
 Is there a way to mess with the modeline without resorting to modeline-format, or is there a way to get the info that lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable adds to the modeline so I can create a custom one without reinventing all these nice modeline modes?

                    <span>My file has a sequence of 1000 numbers, generated in Emacs Evil mode via:
 :r!seq 1000
 I want to keep all numbers with consecutive digits of either 2 or 3 (e.g., 22, 23, 32, 33, 122, 123, 132).
 M-x keep-lines RET [23]\{2\}
 The above works fine, but the following does not work:
 M-: (keep-lines &quot;[23]\{2\}&quot;)
 What is the correct syntax for the latter approach (M-:)? Appreciate a link to the documentation.

                    <span>Hey, did anyone try gtk-3 branch on windows? Does it work? Are there any benefits? I&#x27;m mainly interested if thre are any improvements in hidpi handling since gtk-3 rewrite handles hidpi on Linux pretty well. Also, if there is a decent documantation of how to build it on windows I&#x27;d be thankful for them

                    <span>I am using Cygwin on Windows for Emacs and I am unable to get MELPA to work. I am not sure if I am missing a package that needs to be installed and if so which ones but here is my .emacs file:
 ​
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) ;; Comment/uncomment this line to enable MELPA Stable if desired. See &#x60;package-archive-priorities&#x60; ;; and &#x60;package-pinned-packages&#x60;. Most users will not need or want to do this. ;;(add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) 
 ​
 When I try : 
 M-x package-refresh-contents 
 I get the following:
 Error while verifying signature archive-contents.sig: Command output: gpg: keyblock resource &#x27;/home/jogre/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: can&#x27;t open &#x27;/tmp/epg-signatureQXh3st&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: verify signatures failed: No such file or directory

                    <span>I started using emacs like about 2 weeks, I did enjoy the experience in emacs especially the org-mode. I have some questions regarding some packages that are available for Emacs form the repositories. Since I was familiar with the keyboard navigation style in neovim, I used the package named Evil in Emacs to get vi like naviagtion but, My tab key seems to not respond in the org-mode. I wanted it to give me tabspaces but the cursor is being lazy and standing still. My configuration file that I have written so far is shared here. Emacs experts please help me and point me in right directions. Thanks.

 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for Unicode text. Now you can print Unicode text using TrueType fonts.
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>Hi all, started using Emacs yesterday to write down study notes and managed to activate math symbols preview in the buffer with Mx set-input-method TeX.
 Now I want to specify it in the org file so I don&#x27;t have to type out the command each time I open Emacs, how can it be done? I googled it to no avail, some anwers show a piece of lisp code but I have no idea where to put it and the manual page I&#x27;ve found is not too clear as well.
 I&#x27;m using vanilla Emacs with no customizations.

                    <span>Hello,I&#x27;m switching from vim to emacs. 
 I also want to use native emacs key bindings rather than evil , but
 Emacs tutorial , hasn&#x27;t much ergonomics methods compared to vimtutor .
 I&#x27;m sure, emacs tutorial hiding their methods,
 all I can see in Emacs tutorial is just basic forward , backward , search, nothing detailed ergonomics . 
 Would i know more ?

                    <span>As a speed test, I generated a file with a sequence of 10000 numbers in command line:
 seq 10000 &gt; seq.txt
 I want to keep only numbers with the digits 2, 4, and 6. 
 Using VIM, the following command completes in less than a second:
 :v/^[246]*$/d
 However, when using Emacs Evil mode, it takes more than a minute of my CPU time! Why is it so much slower? Is there an equivalent eLisp command that would be faster? Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got this code from Chapter 39 of Get Programming with Haskell
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BC import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as LC import Network.HTTP.Simple myToken :: BC.ByteString myToken &#x3D; &quot;RXQqorkfHCNzzgJjtYcZXKfdgrpYtkfB&quot; noaaHost :: BC.ByteString noaaHost &#x3D; &quot;www.ncdc.noaa.gov&quot; apiPath :: BC.ByteString apiPath &#x3D; &quot;/cdo-web/api/v2/datasets&quot; response &#x3D; httpLBS &quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot; 
 then this works
 getResponseStatusCode  response 
 giving back 200 just fine. This also seems to go in fine
 buildRequest :: BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; Request buildRequest token host method path &#x3D; setRequestMethod method $ setRequestHost host $ setRequestHeader &quot;token&quot; [token] $ setRequestPath path $ setRequestSecure True $ setRequestPort 443 $ defaultRequest request :: Request request &#x3D; buildRequest myToken noaaHost &quot;GET&quot; apiPath 
 but this is a build and run project with this finally
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do response &lt;- httpLBS request let status &#x3D; getResponseStatusCode response if status &#x3D;&#x3D; 200 then do print &quot;saving request to file&quot; let jsonBody &#x3D; getResponseBody response L.writeFile &quot;data.json&quot; jsonBody else print &quot;request failed with error&quot; 
 Question: Can this final section be repackaged/redone to also work at the REPL? (Using :{ ... :} of course.)

 508kB It&#x27;s what I got with it gziped. Didn&#x27;t find the recommended way to uglify it.
 Maybe I did something wrong? What is the size it should be? (of the js boundle I mean)

                    <span>Building a web-app backend in Scala, I&#x27;m looking for a normal/standard library/framework stack that a typical scala dev would use on a simple backend project that supports the following: HTTP server/API, sql database connection, authentication.
 Coming from the JavaScript world, this stack might be Express (server) + Sequelize (db ORM) + Passport.js (authentication).
 Hoping you all can help cut through the noise and point me in the right direction here :).
 Thank you.

So I have two questions:

                    <span>I am in the process of switching from qwerty to colemak through the tarmak layouts. 
 Have you ever switched layout in Emacs? Did you temporarily remap your core bindings (I mean, you don&#x27;t want to hit C-k by accident when you think you&#x27;re hitting C-n, right?) Or did you go straight to the new bindings? What are pros and cons of these approaches? Looking forward to hear your stories and your opinion

                    <span>Another post about how you can mold data to tell a story!
 In this case we want to check that unit tests remain speedy for a Clojure project. It works also for Scala (and Java I think, not tested). Some tweaking needed for other languages that can export test results to XML reports following JUnit reports.

                    <span>I am in the process of learning Haskell and I just had an epiphany but I want to make sure I haven&#x27;t quite gone off the deep end yet.
 To compare it to C#, a Monad is what an Interface is to a Class in C#, but with all inherited behavior fully defined in the Interface.
 The four Monad operations that I am aware of in Haskell, &gt;&gt;&#x3D;, &gt;&gt;, return and fail, are used to programatically add and change an Interface onto a set of data, or Class in C#.
 This allows a clean set of data to have any interface attached to it and have whatever predefined behavior performed on that data.
 Let me know if I am about right or pretty far off!

 Okay, recursion is so much more concise...

                    <span>Hello, I just started learning Haskell few weeks ago and first worked through the LYAH and now go through the recommended wikibook from the official Haskell site and solve along the 99 problems and some codewars (I hope this is a good approach right now). 
 To learn to build something more real world and less synthetic, I decided to create a small web app where users can rate and comment on courses from my university and then went looking for an appropriate framework. In the official wiki I found https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ which looks like an incredible piece of software engineering and I immediately watched their 25 minute video of demonstration and quite fell in love with it. BUT I am worried that using this would take away a lot of classical Haskell, because to me it seems a lot like Django or similar frameworks. With their different custom syntax operators like |&gt; I feel like I’d be more learning their framework than actually Haskell. Is that a legitimate concern? My main goal is not to build a wonderful web app that makes me $$$ but just to build something with Haskell that is useful and that I can extend over time. 
 Would a more lightweight framework be more appropriate and if so which? Is my impression of it not being really haskelly wrong? It feels like a lot of what makes haskell awesome has been abstracted away for ease of usage which is great for production but probably not for learning. 
 I hope my question is clear and you can understand my concern. Thanks for any input.

                    <span>I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.
 Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can&#x27;t say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.
 Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don&#x27;t understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it. Maybe I &quot;solved&quot; a side-effect of another problem instead?
 Can anybody give me a bit of insight that will either give me confidence in my solution or help me find the real problem?

Secrets reveal how answers.
This zettel is atomic (145 words) and deeply linked. I was bowled over by the déjà vu when searching for a forum post to hang this on that I found a similar post, similarly formatted. and even on the same topic zettel from 2018?!</span>

                    <span>On my home network I have two computers, both running Windows 10.
 On the desktop computer, I&#x27;ve got VcXsrv and WSL1 running, and I have the Linux build of Gnu Emacs 27.1 running under WSL and displaying through X Windows.
 On the laptop computer, I&#x27;ve got VcXsrv running.
 On the emacs on the desktop, I run M-x make-frame-on-display to pop up a frame on the laptop. This way, I have only one instance of emacs running, and I can view and edit the same buffers from both computers without worry of getting my files out of sync. (I tend to pace my apartment while I work, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to access my buffers from two different rooms.)
 Unfortunately, when the laptop goes to sleep, the emacs on the desktop computer freezes for a few seconds and then crashes.
 What would you suggest as a workaround or fix?
 (Please don&#x27;t suggest &quot;delete the frame on the laptop before putting the laptop to sleep&quot;. Yes that would presumably work but I won&#x27;t remember to do that.)

                    <span>i&#x27;m using a spreadsheet in org mode and am trying to figure out how many occurrences i have of a string, specifically &quot;sfp28-10glr-31 intel&quot;. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that does this in my searches and was hoping you might be able to shed some light. 
 thanks much for your help
 the table structure looks like this
 | sfp28-10glr-31 intel, sfp28-10glr-31 cisco, 3m fiber cable | sfp28-10glr-31 intel, sfp28-10glr-31 cisco, 3m fiber cable |

                    <span>I finally figured out how to set up lsp-mode within Doom emacs and I&#x27;m having more fun editing code with emacs than ever before. One question I had though is that when there&#x27;s a &#x27;fix available&#x27; (currently editing c++ code) and it tells me the fix to perform, what&#x27;s the command/shortcut for doing such fix? Apologies for the stupid question I&#x27;ve been using emacs for a few months now and have always just worked with my own (pretty poor) config and am just now realizing what lsp is and why it&#x27;s useful lol.

                    <span>I have (setq gnus-gcc-externalize-attachments &#x27;all) in my configuration, in order not to save sent attachments on disk in my Gcc group. Unfortunately, Gnus has been ignoring this setting (or at least it does not work anymore) since I upgraded from Emacs 26 to Emacs 27.2 with Gnus 5.13.
 Is anybody else having this problem or knows what might be going on?

                    <span>Version: Emacs 26.3 on Debian/Ubuntu 
 Is there a way to use env variables in a link in orgmode?
 So I put a variable NEXT in my /etc/environment file and (getenv &quot;NEXT&quot;) in my init.el file and so far it works. When I want to open a new file, I can use $NEXT in my path, which is nice.
 But sometimes I want to use links with $NEXT instead of \very\long\path\to\Nextcloud in them and that seems to not really work. 
 Is there a way to make this work?

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting this generated heading when I run org-hugo-export-to-md
 ## Heading {#heading} 
 What I really want is just
 ## Heading 
 After reading the docs, I thought that the https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/usage/#org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading is responsible for setting this behaviour. But when I look through counsel-describe-variable, this variable doesn&#x27;t show up in the list.
 Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried setting the variable via these two methods:
 Setting it in my config.el
 (use-package ox-hugo :ensure t :after ox :custom (org-hugo-base-dir &quot;.&quot;) (org-hugo-front-matter-format &quot;yaml&quot;) (org-hugo-section &quot;braindump&quot;) (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading &quot;&quot;)) 
 Setting it in .dir-locals.el
 ((nil . ((org-hugo-base-dir . &quot;.&quot;) (org-hugo-front-matter-format . &quot;yaml&quot;) (org-hugo-section . &quot;braindump&quot;) (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading &quot;&quot;))) 
 But no luck.
 I&#x27;ve posted this issue in the ox-hugo github here https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/449 but I figured maybe I can get a quicker response here since I think the issue is coming from my config not the package.
 EDIT:
 The author of the library replied in the GitHub issue. There is a way to disable it. But it doesn&#x27;t help me in my overall goal. Thanks for reading.

                    <span>Hi, currently learning Haskell and pretty much everywhere I look I am told that one should avoid explicit recursion and try and use functional abstractions like fold or map.
 This has caused me some pain when, as an exercise, I was implementing the library function dropWhile. My initial implementation using explicit recursion looked like this:
 dropWhile :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] dropWhile _ [] &#x3D; [] dropWhile p xs@(x:xs&#x27;) | p x &#x3D; dropWhile&#x27; p xs&#x27; | otherwise &#x3D; xs 
 This also seems to match the implementation used in the GHC source code.
 After some perusing I found an example using foldr as follows:
 dropWhile :: (a -&gt; Bool )-&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] dropWhile p &#x3D; fst . foldr f ([], []) where f x ~(xs,ys) &#x3D; (if p x then xs else x:ys, x:ys) 
 After some head wracking I do understand the second definition. However I would like to know if this is a situation in which the implementation using explicit recursion is preferable as it is easier to reason about?

                    <span>I am trying (with the blessing of the cabal maintainers and the haskell foundation) to spearhead an initiative to re-vamp the cabal documentation. Right now it is a combination of reference material, and a user guide. It would be nice to have a beginner friendly, linear guide that walks a newcomer through the most common use cases of cabal.
 I am trying to keep on top of the issue tracker and provide plenty of context. The first three sections have all their required chapters recorded in the issue tracker https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/issues
 I plan on adding the more advanced chapters as issues later, but if anyone feels especially strongly about contributing those it would be greatly appreciated. They can be found in the SUMMARY.md https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md
 I want this project to be friendly to beginner contributors, so if you want to take an issue and learn as you write it, I would love that and will be happy to offer any guidance I can (as well as coercing more senior cabal contributors to offer input).
 Thanks everyone, I think this is a really important initiative to improve the haskell ecosystem for the uninitiated and the old guard alike!

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m seeing weird behavior with this implementation of open tracing as it&#x27;s not producing fully isolated spans (some spans are combining together). My theory is that this is from the context switching between threads in the ExecutionContext but would really appreciate any nudges in the right direction. 
 Below is the code I&#x27;ve written so far https://scastie.scala-lang.org/DZCCyl8WRoOBgeragoDbXQ

                    <span>Is there a way to examine the LLVM IR generated by scala native?
 I ran the sample template project listed here - https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/sbt.html#minimal-sbt-project and got a bunch of ll files - 0.ll, 1.ll, 2.ll, etc each of which seems to contain obfuscated LLVM IR. Is it meant to look like this and be unreadable?
 I can see that there is a Main.NIR file (as expected). Do I need to convert the NIR to LLVM IR in some way?

                    <span>Age 
 http4s - 7 years
 http4k - 1 year
 
 Website 
 http4s - bare bone
 http4k - looks like a microsite, but still provides some confidence.
 
 Features and integrations 
 http4s - bare bone. Almost 0 integrations.
 http4k - well equiped with provided modules for telemetry, resilience, oauth, aws, chaos engineering, cloud native support etc.
 
 Documentation 
 http4s - Incomplete to the point of missing a lot of FAQ type use cases.
 http4k - Well rounded documentation covering most common and upcoming use cases like resilience, rpc, graphql, telemetry.
 
 Prerequisites 
 http4s - Decent understanding of Cats, fs2, Free&#x27;s is a must.
 http4k - Well... read the documentation.
 
  
And this is when we compare http4s which is quite mature scala project to a new project like http4k. So... why ?

                    <span>This post describes how to use OBazl to
build OCaml projects with Bazel.
Compared to the first OCaml ruleset published in
2016, which contains only a few basic rules, OBazl is under active development
and aims to provide highly granular, low-level control over the build, and
eventually automatically generate build files.
It is therefore a practical choice to enjoy Bazel’s incremental, parallel,
cacheable and remote building capacities.
However, it is in its early stages, requiring manual work for some tasks that
will be automated in the future.
To exemplify its usage, I will show how to convert the build of the
uri package to Bazel. Since OCaml and
Bazel is not a frequent combination, I will give an introduction to Bazel, as
well as some aspects of compiling OCaml modules.

                    <span>I know that using M-x setenv I can set LYNX_LSS to /etc/lynx.lss.
 What I can&#x27;t figure out is how to set that in ~/.emacs.d/init.el so I don&#x27;t have to go thru that every time
 I start emacs. I don&#x27;t know lisp so I&#x27;ve tried copying and editing a few examples I found on the net:
 http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_env_var_paths.html
 but nothing seems to work.
 I would appreciate any help.
 Thanks

                    <span>i believe there&#x27;s builtin help documentation on keymaps (in evil mode). i&#x27;ve scoured the internet to find information about especially the  leader combinations. i&#x27;ve become a fan of this leader key shortcuts. but the thing is i cant find documentation that covers it.
 i&#x27;ve tried  h f &quot;map!&quot; ; but that spits out elisp! what&#x27;s the command to discover these bindings?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup emacs for develop using Dart. I&#x27;ve already installed Flutter &amp; Dart on my system, so I&#x27;m trying to setup lsp-dart.
 This is my init.el file:
 ;; Install use-package (condition-case nil (require &#x27;use-package) (file-error (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;use-package) (require &#x27;use-package))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t) (use-package lsp-dart :ensure t :hook (dart-mode . lsp)) ;; Optional packages (use-package projectile :ensure t) ;; project management (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (yas-global-mode)) ;; snippets (use-package lsp-ui :ensure t) ;; UI for LSP (use-package company :ensure t) ;; Auto-complete ;; Optional Flutter packages (use-package hover :ensure t) ;; run app from desktop without emulator 
 which I copy-pasted from the emacs-lsp&#x27;s github page.
 The problem is that I retrieve this error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-dart: Package ‘lsp-dart-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Failed to install projectile: Package ‘projectile-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Cannot load projectile 
 and I cannot figure how to resolve it. 
 I&#x27;ve tried to install projectile using M-x package-install RET projectile RET (after enabling MELPA), but I get an error saying that projectile-2.3.0 cannot be found, while the MELPA website says that the projectile current version is 2.4.0.
 ​
 What am I missing?

                    <span>Sorry if this is a dumb question! How can I edit lines in a *xref* buffer containing grep results? I&#x27;m looking for something like pressing &quot;e&quot; in Occur buffer.
 There is a key binding &quot;r&quot;, but I find it only applies to the search text instead of the entire line. Am I missing something?

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to hear about the layouts you&#x27;ve selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.
 Background, for normal, sane people who don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about:
 One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.
 These keyboards make heavy use of &#x27;layers&#x27; - additional custom &#x27;modifier&#x27; keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..
 For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as &quot;home row modifiers&quot;. Typically you&#x27;d make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.
 But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I&#x27;m interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they&#x27;ve settled on.
 I&#x27;m playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a &#x27;game&#x27; in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I&#x27;m thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.

                    <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m asking the impossible:
 Does anyone have any Emacs configs that would make Emacs so easy to use, that normal people like my partner would be able to utilize it for their daily TODO lists?
 I&#x27;m talking GUI friendly options, sane normal people keyboard shortcut choices, and even the ability to totally ignore normal Emacs regular keybindings.
 I ask because I was showing off what Org Mode could do, but was told that it looked too complicated to use.
 Does anyone have any links to some super-easy-to-use user-friendly Emacs configs that would be mouse and GUI based? (I know, its sacrilege but hey, gotta try somehow).
 I know Emacs without a config has the context menu which is fine, but yeah, looking for some tips in this department. This person was debating using it for TODO lists for work, and also maybe for writing scripts for TV shows, etc.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hey guys. It looks like OpenAI is collaborating with GitHub on their GPT stuff, so any assistance in building an editor in emacs would be greatly appreciated. I made a start 4 months ago, link below:
  
https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/
 https://copilot.github.com/
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;27676266
  
I am looking for some help bundling this up as an emacs package and ongoing work on connecting GPT-j (and others) to various emacs libraries.
 I personally believe GPT-3+vscode is an emacs killer. That is not the view of everybody here. But I believe emacs is a much better platform for building this stuff, so please help! Thanks.

                    <span>I was playing around with fancy record libaries and was very impressed with how well labels can infer types. Probably because it avoids unnecessary complexity and less-frequently-used operations.
 So I wanted to try how much unnecessary complexity and infrequently operations I could throw on top of it while maintaining reasonable type inference. Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.
 union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: (&quot;foo&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bi&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bar&quot; :&#x3D; Int, &quot;baz&quot; :&#x3D; Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: (&quot;foo&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bi&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bar&quot; :&#x3D; Int, &quot;baz&quot; :&#x3D; Double) 
 The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:
 type family Concat l r where Concat &#x27;[] a &#x3D; a Concat (x &#x27;: xs) a &#x3D; x &#x27;: Concat xs a 
 I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:
 l :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2] l &#x3D; Proxy r :: Proxy &#x27;[3,4] r &#x3D; Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c &#x3D;&gt; Proxy a -&gt; Proxy b -&gt; Proxy c cat _ _ &#x3D; Proxy c1 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] c1 &#x3D; cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy &#x27;[3,4] c2 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] c2 &#x3D; cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2] c3 &#x3D; cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] 
 And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1
 You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks. Does anyone know of a cleaner/less silly solution?

 How can I use uniqueness in Haskell as contructor?

                    <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working through Types and Programming Languages by Pierce lately and really enjoying it. Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it&#x27;s variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). 
 I&#x27;m interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to &quot;desugar&quot; syntax into it&#x27;s core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I&#x27;ve considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. However I can see it&#x27;s been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.
 Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I&#x27;m interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it&#x27;s interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.
 I&#x27;m aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.
 Cheers

                    <span>I&#x27;m starting a small actor oriented project in Typed Akka and was thinking of possibly using this as an excuse to update my knowledge by doing the project in Scala 3. I noticed that the official quick start giter8 template akka/akka-quickstart-scala.g8 uses Scala version 2.13.1 
 I have attempted to add Akka dependencies to the Scala 3 template scala/scala3.g8 and also attempted to change the Scala version number in the Akka template but both result in unresolved dependencies and failed to build.
 Is there a way to get Scala 3 and Typed Akka up and running with current versions (I saw an older unofficial template from 2019 using Dotty but nothing more recent)?
 If I must I can postpone using Scala 3 to a later project. It is more vital that this use Akka than that it use Scala 3.

                    <span>I am developing an MVP for a SaaS product as a progressive web app hosted on Firebase at the request of a VC. As I get started I am reminded why I f**king hate TypeScript/JavaScript so much. I&#x27;d say between not being that good at FE to begin with and having to manage dumb error messages I am losing velocity. I&#x27;d love to develop this in Scala.JS and Laminar as it’s so much simpler and I already know Scala fairly well, but I am worried that if when the MVP needs to scale and onboard new developers I will have trouble finding any. Should I just suck it up and use React? Part of me feels like I am putting the cart in front of the horse worrying about what will happen if this product will get funding when it hasn&#x27;t yet.

                    <span>I&#x27;m playing around with readability when reading large blocks of text in emacs, and sometimes the lines kind of blur together for me when I&#x27;m reading. I think coloring each sentence a different color would help me keep track of my place without needing to actively highlight each line. As far as I can tell, the only way to do this is with some implementation of faces. However, it looks like each face is assigned to a single color, so I would have to figure out how to switch to a different face for each sentence in a paragraph. The fact that I&#x27;m doing all of this within org-mode kinda complicates things too, since I only want this to apply to paragraphs, not other elements.
 Has anyone else attempted to do anything similar to this? Is there a better way to approach this?

                    <span>Hey, I started today to create my emacs config. I&#x27;m following the Emacs from scratch series from System Crafters in youtube. 
 I want to have the same mappings I have on Neovim. I&#x27;m using general.el and my leader key is the spacebar. And I want to map spacebar to do fuzzy search, so by just pressing double spacebar I&#x27;m searching for a file (similar to doom-emacs amd what I have on my neovim config). 
 Can&#x27;t figure what is the syntax for mapping the spacebar. For setting the leader key, using SPC worked, but doesn&#x27;t work for mapping spacebar after the prefix. 
 Here&#x27;s how I have defined my leader key.
 (use-package general :config (general-evil-setup t) (general-create-definer rune/leader-keys :global-prefix &quot;SPC&quot;)) 
 And here are the mappings I have:
 (rune/leader-keys &#x27;normal &quot;b&quot; &#x27;(:ignore b :which-key &quot;buffers&quot;) &quot;bb&quot; &#x27;(counsel-switch-buffer :which-key &quot;all buffers&quot;) &quot;bs&quot; &#x27;(save-buffer :which-key &quot;save buffer&quot;) &quot;bq&quot; &#x27;(kill-current-buffer :which-key &quot;quit buffer&quot;) &quot;/&quot; &#x27;(swiper :which-key &quot;search in buffer&quot;)) 
 What I have tried:
 &quot;SPC&quot; &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) &quot;&quot; &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) 
 That last one I tried:
 (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) 
 Those don&#x27;t work, can anyone point me in the right direction ? Thanks.

                    <span>Does anyone know how to make the side scrolling wheel scroll left/right? To be specific, I have the Logitech MX 3 mouse which has both a scroll wheel for vertical and horizontal scrolling. While I know that learning the keybindings is a good idea (don&#x27;t worry I already know them), it is nice to actually have the mouse work in the one would it expect it should. I did check out Xah&#x27;s blog on mouse configuration, but he doesn&#x27;t mention this. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Greetings Emacslings,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to get company-mode to only trigger completion on tab. This is my set up, which does pretty much what I want:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package company :defer t :diminish &quot;&quot; :hook ((prog-mode) . (lambda () (company-mode))) :config (setq tab-always-indent &#x27;complete) (setq company-idle-delay nil) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3) :bind (:map company-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . &#x27;company-indent-or-complete-common) :map company-active-map (&quot;C-n&quot; . &#x27;company-select-next-or-abort) (&quot;C-j&quot; . &#x27;company-select-next-or-abort) (&quot;C-p&quot; . &#x27;company-select-previous-or-abort) (&quot;C-k&quot; . &#x27;company-select-previous-or-abort)))
 (use-package company-prescient :defer t :hook (company-mode . company-prescient-mode)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The only problem now is that yasnippets are borked up: tab triggers company, which doesn&#x27;t test to see if it can expand as yasnippet first. Is there any way for me to get this working how I&#x27;d like?
 Edit: better minimal example

Basically, I am working in a very bright environment and dark themes make it quite difficult to see anything. However, in light themes, all of the equations are a faint light color that blend in too much with the light background (I am using the gui mode)
 I am looking for something that is
  
Light theme: something that looks good on gui mode
 Code in math mode is dark, contrasting the light background
  
Thank you for your time.

                    <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a long time but my needs are not that fancy so my understanding of it is not that great. I&#x27;m mostly using it to edit DNS (bind) and configuration files. 
 I have for a long time had this peculiar thing come up. In most of my dns zone files the TAB key acts as I want, ie when you press TAB the cursor moves 8 characters to the right, (from position 1) when you move the marker with arrow left it jumps back to position 1, and if you press TAB again it jumps 8 characters to the right again.
 But in some files when I press TAB the marker moves to something like position 16. Now when you press arrow left the marker goes to the left as if the space is filled with spaces. If you try to press TAB again nothing happens.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to read the documentation on how to program the TAB key but I haven&#x27;t been able to solve the problem.

I know about lsp-org but that seems to only work with editing inside the actual org file and it seems wonky at best (flycheck detecting things outside source block). This is for python with lsp-pyright. I&#x27;m also wondering if the special org src buffer has a hook on closing or something. I want to run my python black command when I close the src buffer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working like it does in my normal files. This the package I&#x27;m using: https://github.com/pythonic-emacs/blacken

                    <span>Hi, is there a package that displays the distance number from the cursor position above every character of the current line? It would be useful because it would be possible to move the cursor exactly in the position of a specific character using a evil-mode shortcut, pressing a number and h/l to move right or left a specific number of times. I have yet the distance from current line for every line, using linum, but i think that even this feature would be useful.

                    <span>I get the following stack backtrace when using Emacs for windows built as such. 
 Digging deeper, this is the lisp form that is causing problems:
  (desktop-create-buffer 208 &quot;c:/Users/thequ/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.el&quot; &quot;.emacs.el&quot; &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode &#x27;(eldoc-mode override-global-mode global-auto-revert-mode flx-ido-mode dired-omit-mode auto-complete-mode) 35 &#x27;(1 nil) nil nil &#x27;((buffer-display-time 24790 5102 984406 0) (buffer-file-coding-system . undecided-dos)) &#x27;((mark-ring (36)))) 
 and it is the dired-omit-mode part of this lisp form that is barfing. 
 I think I will remove this form from the desktop records to get it to work. But if you could explain why this happened and how to fix it, I would appreciate it.

                    <span>Underscores and dashes are treated as word breaks so when I use the evil commands like dw to delete a word such as abc-abc-abc I have type 5cw instead of just cw.
 Can this setting be configured?
 I don&#x27;t mind some code which can change the configuration on the fly, perhaps I can use Cw for cases when I want to see dashes as regular letters of a word and use cw for the standard usage.

                    <span>I just installed and configured “vanilla” Emacs today with standard Emacs keybindings as they remind me of my old Wordstar and Word Perfect days on MS-DOS. I’m not a coder or programmer. I write and edit legal documents for a living. I have installed a dark theme and some add-ons.
 I’ve started using it for its text editing capabilities, but I am impressed with its extensible features as well. It has now become my go-to for most html browsing and I also browse Gemini capsules and Gopher holes with it. I really like the file manager, built-in terminal (I use a lot of tui apps out of preference), multimedia and internet radio support, org-mode which I am using to write unit meeting agendas, as well as the built in games.
 I’m looking for suggestions for additional extensions that work with my use case as I would like to use Emacs for the majority of my workflow rather than rely on multiple tui and GUI applications. Additional game recommendations would be welcome as well.
 Emacs seems like an another OS within my OS (I use Fedora at home and when I telework).
 Initially I thought that Emacs would be “too hard and complicated” but I have enjoyed the tutorial and documentation. I feel like I am just scratching the surface.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to write a small GHC extension to get my hands on GHC hacking. As suggested by the GHC gitlab wiki, I started off by having a look at this article by SPJ and SM to get a feel for GHC&#x27;s architecture.
 I now have an idea for what I think would be a relatively small GHC extension that I would like to have a crack at as a first attempt at actually modifying GHC&#x27;s source code: CoercibleStrings. The outcome would be similar in spirit to that of the existing OverloadedStrings GHC extension, however, the latter I believe &quot;only&quot; infers the type (Data.String.IsString a) &#x3D;&gt; a for a string literal l during type checking and then desugars them to fromString l, where fromString :: (Data.String.IsString a) &#x3D;&gt; String -&gt; a is from the typeclass Data.String.IsString.

                    <span>I am interested on the state of Haskell (server side and back-end more specifically). I have seen some git repos that provide some bindings in C in order to execute Haskell on Swift. 
 Is it possible to have Haskell on the Backend and Swift on the frontend? Are the efforts not worth it?

                    <span>Hi all ... I&#x27;ve been playing with Haskell on Ubuntu (20.04, Focal), having recently installed it with the command &quot;sudo apt-get install haskell-platform&quot;. ghci seems to work fine, but anything I try compiling with ghc gives a linker error.
 For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; $ ghc hello.hs
 [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( hello.hs, hello.o ) Linking hello ... /usr/bin/ld.gold: fatal error: hello: Input/output error collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc&#x27; failed in phaseLinker&#x27;. (Exit code: 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 hello.hs is this program:
 haskell main &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Hello, World!&quot; 
 Any idea how I can get this to compile?

                    <span>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-replicant-0.1.0.1
 This is my second Haskell library. It is a low-level library that creates a logical replication slot and streams changes to your program from your PostgreSQL server.
 It&#x27;s still experimental and ready for library authors and interested hackers to kick the tires and build real-time applications with it.
 Future plans include: - handling user-defined types - libraries based on conduit and other popular streaming packages
 Thanks for taking a look. And thanks to this community. I built this library from scratch on my stream and am grateful for those who&#x27;ve been watching and cheering me on. This is a library I&#x27;ve wanted for a while and I hope you enjoy it too!

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a way to convert a tuple into a &quot;type map&quot;.
 Example:
  val t: (Int, (String, Double)) &#x3D; (3, (&quot;Pi&quot;, 3.14)) val m &#x3D; toTypeMap(t) val i: Int &#x3D; m.get[Int] // returns 3 val s: String &#x3D; m.get[String] // returns &quot;Pi&quot; val d: Double &#x3D; m.get[Double] // returns 3.14 
 toTypeMap(t) should only compile if t contains no duplicate types, i.e. wouldn&#x27;t compile for an (Int, Int). Calling get[T] should only compile if the tuple contains the type T. 
 Perhaps &quot;type map&quot; is not the canonical name for this. What I&#x27;m thinking of is something like ZIO&#x27;s Env, basically a Map that lets you retrieve elements based on the type of the element.
 edit: the tuple doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be &quot;nested&quot;

 WIP Roguelike
 I&#x27;ve made a little roguelike starter kit for Indigo to do some of the heavy lifting.
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit
 In truth I hope to stay ahead of the tutorial to make sure the starter kit has all the tools needed for anyone else having a go. I have to make sure it works somehow!
 You can follow my own progress here and use it as a reference if it helps:

 If you do have a go and get stuck, feel free to join the indigo Discord and say hello.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been unable to run the elixir shell using alchemist-iex-run because the erlang executable erl is not found in my path. Here&#x27;s the error:
  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/elixir/1.12.1/bin/elixir: line 230: exec: erl: not found Process Alchemist-IEx exited abnormally with code 127 
 In an attempt to fix this, in init.el I added:  (add-to-list &#x27;exec-path &quot;/opt/homebrew/bin&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;exec-path &quot;/opt/homebrew/sbin&quot;) 
 But this still doesn&#x27;t work. Here&#x27;s the result from...
 vterm echo $PATH
 Includes the added homebrew paths.
 (exec-path) Includes the added homebrew paths.
 (call-process &quot;ENV&quot; nil t) Does not include the added homebrew paths.
 Erlang shell: os:cmd(&quot;echo $PATH&quot;). Does not include the added homebrew paths. But does add its own path to erl: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/erlang/24.0.2_1/lib/erlang/erts-12.0.2/bin.
 How do correctly set that path so that the homebrew paths always appear?

                    <span>I never used EXWM, but if I&#x27;m not wrong it allows you to switch between different workspaces, where each workspace has its own frame configuration. For instance, I can do a vertical split in workspace 1, than move to workspace 2 which will be a new empty frame, not vertically splitted. Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn&#x27;t manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I&#x27;m currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window. Why you don&#x27;t just use EXWM, you might ask. Because for now I&#x27;m quite skeptical about its usefulness for me, so I want to take my time to understand if it&#x27;s something that might actually improve my workflow. In the meanwhile, I would really love a feature like the one described above. I started only very recently to use Emacs so sorry if the feature I&#x27;m looking for is something obvious or basic. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with emacs for a few days, mainly with org-mode, and I really like it and the idea of it. But, I&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface. I thought a way for me to get into using emacs would be learning a new language, and looked into C++. I found this great guide for using C++ with emacs, but frankly I&#x27;m a bit intimidated by how many extensions and how much configuration are required. It makes me want to just use a more standard IDE.
 I guess I have two questions for more experienced users: 1. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is coding with emacs at odds with using an IDE, and I should be looking at a different work flow entirely, rather than forcing emacs to have ide like features? 2. What sort of stands out for folks as the reason it was worth climbing up the emacs learning curve?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to set up lsp-mode to work with clangd, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any instructions anywhere. I&#x27;m under the impression that it&#x27;s supposed to just work, and I have a hook set up for c++ mode, but the result is lsp[disconnected] and no actual attempt to connect to clangd. Is there something else I need to do? clangd is on my path so it should be easy to find.

                    <span>As the title indicates, I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble finding the source files for the Elisp functions. Specifically, when I&#x27;m attempting to call
 M-x xref-find-definitions 
 in any buffer of any major mode. For example, running that function on 
 xref-find-definitions 
 in the info buffer causes emacs to return with
 Find definitions of (default xref-find-definitions): 
 so we hit  and are shown 
 Visit tags table (default TAGS): /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info 
 hit that  again and we get 
 File /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info/TAGS does not exist 
 (note that running 
 xref-etags-mode 
 doesn&#x27;t change anything)
 now I&#x27;m aware this has to do something with the &#x27;etags&#x27; shell command, but this only creates a tags table in a specific working directory. How would I configure so that I have a global tags table so that anywhere I could run 
 xref-find-definitions 
 and go take a look at the course code of a function?
 Thanks

                    <span>I am having a hard time getting consult-line to make matches with just orderless-regexp. The instructions at https://github.com/oantolin/orderless/issues/31#issuecomment-763908249 are thorough but don’t seem to override my usual behavior of allowing for orderless-initialism matches, and unlike the code suggested there, I do not want any matches to be made if a regexp search fails (much like how Swiper works. My config looks like this:
 (use-package orderless :init (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless) orderless-matching-styles &#x27;(orderless-literal orderless-regexp orderless-initialism) completion-category-defaults nil) :config (orderless-define-completion-style just-regexp (orderless-matching-styles &#x27;(orderless-regexp))) (setf (alist-get &#x27;consult-location completion-category-overrides) &#x27;(styles just-regexp)) (setq orderless-style-dispatchers &#x27;(without-if-bang)) (defun without-if-bang (pattern _index _total) (cond ((equal &quot;!&quot; pattern) &#x27;(orderless-literal . &quot;&quot;)) ((string-prefix-p &quot;!&quot; pattern) &#x60;(orderless-without-literal . ,(substring pattern 1)))))) 
 Thank you for any help!

                    <span>Hey Emacs lovers, I&#x27;ve updated the top-up for the Inside Emacs videos by adding the files and commands used in the last 3 videos on org-table I uploaded recently.
 This top-up is for you if you like the videos and:
  
you want the list of the commands used in the videos,
 or you want to practice your Emacs workflow by reproducing some of the actions in the videos with the files I&#x27;ve used.
  
For instance, if you&#x27;re interested on trying the commands related to exporting tables in org-mode we discussed in Inside Emacs #6 (part 6), you can:
  
find the commands in this section of the README,
 and try them with the org file org-table.org.
  
I hope this top-up can help you reduce the time between the moment you watched the video and the moment you&#x27;re able to do what&#x27;s in the video and much more.
 If there something missing in the top-up or you think of another way of presenting it, let me know.
 Have a nice day :)

                    <span>For a Gantt from org-mode project I use SVG to create the final chart. I use the  element to add information on tasks as a pop-up.
 This works nicely in a browser but not in the native emacs SVG viewer. I tried this in emacs 27 that comes with ubuntu 21.04 and in a freshly compiled version from https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git using the master branch.
 Any ideas on if this is possible and/or how to get this to work ?
 Thanks,
 Jouke

 So I&#x27;m in an org-table and I give it a simple addition like (+ 8 $4) But it seems to be multiplying (8 * the_number_in_column4) rather than the correct behavior of (8 + the_number_in_column4). 
 I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a mistake on my part and not emacs, but I&#x27;m very interested to see where I went wrong. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance and have a great day.

                    <span>(I think I finally fixed the formatting, didn&#x27;t realize I had to go into Markdown mode)
 I&#x27;d been searching for a while for a way to do this but couldn&#x27;t find it, so yesterday I sat down and coded my own. With this function and binding, when I hit Return on a file in Dired it either opens the file asynchronously in an external command if the file format-command combo is defined in dired-guess-shell-alist-user etc., or opens the file in Emacs as usual if the format is not bound to a command.
 (defun dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command () &quot;If there is a default command defined for this file type, run it asynchronously.If not, open it in Emacs.&quot; (interactive) (let ( ;; get the default for the file type, ;; putting the string into a list because dired-guess-default throws an error otherwise. (default (dired-guess-default (cons (dired-get-filename) &#x27;()))) ;; put the file name into a list so dired-shell-stuff-it will accept it (file-list (cons (dired-get-filename) &#x27;()))) (if (null default) ;; if no default found for file, open in Emacs (dired-find-file) ;; if default is found for file, run command asynchronously (dired-run-shell-command (dired-shell-stuff-it (concat default &quot; &amp;&quot;) file-list nil))))) ;; This function is bound to the Return key in dired-mode to replace the default behavior on Return (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command) ;; For added convenience: Don&#x27;t open a new Async Shell Command window (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist(cons &quot;\\*Async Shell Command\\*.*&quot; (cons #&#x27;display-buffer-no-window nil))) ;; Always open a new buffer if default is occupied. (setq async-shell-command-buffer &#x27;new-buffer) 
 These modification more or less &quot;complete&quot; Dired for me as a file manager for everyday use without annoyance or cognitive load. The shell command and async shell command functions and keys remain available for more involved stuff like multiple files, but for 95% of my uses this is sufficient.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m currently digging through Programming in Scala - Fifth Edition. While I generally like the new control syntax, now in chapter 9.4 I realize that it does not extend to user defined control structures. E.g given
 def myscope(byNameParam : &#x3D;&gt; Unit) : Unit &#x3D; println(&quot;BEGIN&quot;) byNameParam println(&quot;END&quot;) 
 I cannot use
 myscope println(&quot;test&quot;) 
 but instead still have to use
 myscope { println(&quot;test&quot;) } 
 This is slightly annoying. Will this restriction be lifted at some point?

                    <span>Hi everyone! I’ve been using zettelkästen on and off for 1/2 years. The problem is I have both physical and digital notes, which are not integrated. 
Also I think I’ve been doing it wrong the whole time since I only noted excerpts basically.
I was wondering how to fix it.
Should I divide literature and permanent notes?
Thank you for your time</span>

Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks,

PS The notes are stored in iCloud, in a 1Writer notes folder. Don&#x27;t know if that affects things...</span>

                    <span>edit: &quot;Grokking&quot; not &quot;Groking&quot;. Sorry for the typo in the title.
 I&#x27;m trying to &quot;grok emacs&quot;. I&#x27;ve heard high praises, the enlightenment, what not. I have not found it yet. Over the years:
  
Done emacs tutorials multiple times (forget most key bindings).
 Did org-mode tutorial once and created a huge org-mode daily-notes file. Abandoned it.
 Know scheme, and have done problems in it (but otherwise an experience C and python programmer). Can comfortably read and understand basic e-lisp, but otherwise I&#x27;m an e-lisp beginner.
 Now set up doom emacs (so evil mode; I&#x27;m an experienced vim+tmux+i3wm user).
 Did emacs tutorial one last time yesterday (all of it).
 Doing an org-mode daily notes file (this time probably I&#x27;ll stick with it).
  
So yeah, as you can see I have a mixed background. I&#x27;m …</span>

                    <span>I understand the emacs way to do this is to download a package for each file type/mode and use the indent functions specific to that mode, but not every package has an &quot;un-indent&quot; or &quot;shift left&quot; function. In these cases, they seem to expect you to manually delete white space in front of the line to un-indent. Also, working all of these different indent functions into my existing keybinds is annoying.
 I have a package (github) that detects the indentation offset and updates the tab-width variable in emacs. Does anyone have a package/function that can use this variable to indent/dedent single or multiple lines?
 Thank you

 Is there a way to save the current line number of the buffer to make next emacs session of this file to open on this line number ? Or add a bunch of code in .emacs ??
 Ex: emacs journal ; editing at line 33; Ctrl-X -c;
 On minute later : emacs journal &#x3D;&#x3D; &gt; displays right on line 33

 Welcome screen (left) with SVG image and font variations converted to PS file (right)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for Images. Now you can print Emacs Welcome screen in all its glory.
 Cavaet: Since PS only supports JPG and bitmaps for images, SVG and PNG with transparency will require manual conversion for desirable output.
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>Hi all! 
 I received the following notice because I was subscribed to the &#x27;Intermediate Haskell&#x27; newsletter, but thought it might be worthwhile to know for other people on Reddit as well:
  
Hey! 
 You are receiving this email because you have subscribed to updates about the &#x27;Intermediate Haskell&#x27; book. 
 The book is cancelled. Vlad and Artyom and all other contributors have switched to other things. 
 [...] 
 Anything that we write will likely be announced on Twitter: https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u&#x3D;67b31bfe9303116749c079389&amp;id&#x3D;25c6c78b9d&amp;e&#x3D;3e3ab466bb is Vlad&#x27;s, and https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u&#x3D;67b31bfe9303116749c079389&amp;id&#x3D;97065ee399&amp;e&#x3D;3e3ab466bb is Artyom&#x27;s. 
 Bye!
  
Writing a book is a very large and difficult ordeal, so it is not strange for a book to be cancelled and I wish the authors the best &lt;3.
 Hopefully some other work(s) will fill the gap between &#x27;beginner&#x27; and &#x27;expert&#x27; material of Haskell in the (near?) future.

                    <span>I am creating a application that will make extensive use of the GUI in the Linux environment, I am not so interested in porting to Windows at this time, though perhaps I may in the future.
 I have tried using Gtk, wxHaskell, and Fltkhs, and all of them fail during compilation now. They clearly worked in the past, but apparently are not being maintained anymore.
 Now, at this point, I am prepared to fork one of them and bring it current for LTS 18.0 (and beyond), but I would rather not have to do that, as I want to just write the application, but will if I have to.
 Can anyone please point me to a GUI framework that compiles and links flawlessly with LTS 18.0 without a fuss? And why is there so little maintenance on these GUI frameworks to begin with?
 I will also be making use of FRP in this project, and many others to come, but they so far don&#x27;t seem to suffer from the same problems, for the most part.
 I would also prefer not to have to rely on Qt, as I did for a prior (non-Haskell) project, and they yanked the part I was heavily reliant on out of Open Source, the bloody bastards! :)
 Any suggestions at this point would be extremely helpful.

 Does anyone have minimum example to rendering string or font using GLFW-b in Haskell OpenGL ?
 Currently, I use GLUT to render string inside My Haskell OpenGL binding project.

 here is the code to render &quot;Hello World&quot;
  preservingMatrix $ do translate (Vector3 (u/2.0) 0 0 :: Vector3 GLdouble) GL.scale (1/scaleFont :: GL.GLdouble) (1/scaleFont) 1 GL.blend $&#x3D; GL.Disabled preservingMatrix $ GLUT.renderString GLUT.Roman &quot;Hello World&quot; GL.blend $&#x3D; GL.Enabled 
 ​
 ​
 Here is my Stack dependencies 
 ​
 stack ls dependencies
 GLFW-b 3.2.1.0 OpenGL 3.0.3.0 OpenGLRaw 3.3.3.0 GLUT 2.7.0.15 
 ​
 But the text is very bad and weird and hard to recognize the word.
 What I have tried so far.
 Disabled Blend when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 Disabled Lighting when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 ​
 Here is the image you can see how bad the font is using GLUT or I did something wrong.
 Can you recognize &quot;Hello World&quot;?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve gone round and round with this issue, i.e., how to add a non-Prelude package. I like to work with org-mode babel for Haskell, i.e., without a specific project directory, just babel source blocks interacting with a non-project REPL. My Emacs non-project Haskell stuff works, I&#x27;m guessing, because it&#x27;s relies on my ~/.stack/global-project. But let&#x27;s leave that aside for now.
 So let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m just trying to get a plain-vanilla project to work with an outside package. So I create a new project with stack new basicmath And let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to get Diagrams to work just like they give with the example code here, i.e., &quot;Your First Diagram.&quot; I&#x27;m trying all the install instructions at the command prompt in .../basicmath/, none work. I&#x27;m guessing something needs to happen with the basicmath.cabal or the stack.yaml? But I look in vain for any concrete examples. Confusing to me also is whether to actually use cabal when I&#x27;m supposed to be using stack. In any case, nothing works. How exactly would I make the example code work?
 I&#x27;d eventually like to see this work on the Emacs babel side, but I won&#x27;t get greedy yet. Emacs babel is just a wrapper apparently for feeding multiple lines into a non-project global REPL, i.e., fraught.
 A really good tutorial on this would be nice to find, BTW. Most of what I&#x27;ve seen is just someone&#x27;s stream-of-consciousness hypnosis ramblings, i.e., leaving a beginner to do guess-and-test over and over. And beginner books don&#x27;t talk about it either; rather, you simply put code in a file and load it at the REPL as you work through these books. (I did find one book that walks you through a project creation. But it has no example of adding a non-Prelude package.) Would another IDE handle adding packages better? What about VS Code?

                    <span>I cannot find a thread that compare mind map with org. I use mind map since 20 years, so I saw some video from org so far. It looks really beautiful, but cannot find advantages over mindmap software. What are a couple of advantages of org over mindmap apart because is built into the fabolous emacs system?

                    <span>Hello there,
 https://github.com/overdr0ne/gumshoe
 What is it?
 Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder. It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil&#x27;s jump list, but works more generically.
 Why?
 Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I’m getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim’s jump list which, in Evil’s implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn’t work when you’re not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I&#x27;d share.
 Does anyone do anything similar? Comments and suggestions welcome!

 markdown-mode[2] by Jason Blevins seems not have this function.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the Pillow package. If I type:
 ​
 from PIL import Image
 pic &#x3D; Image.new(0, 0)
 pic.
 ​
 I will get completions for the Image class. However if I do: 
 pic &#x3D; Image.open(&quot;pic.png&quot;)
 Followed by &quot;pic.&quot; I get no completions. If I call company-complete it says &quot;No completion found&quot;. Why am I not getting completions after Image.open? Is it something peculiar about the open call (the doc says it doesn&#x27;t actually load the image at the time you call open)? In vscode I do get proper completions for Image class after calling Image.open. Any thoughts? Thanks.

                    <span>Suppose that I have a buffer or region with a lot of lines like these:
 [[ 1.1, -4.2 ], [ 3.14, -2.718 ]], [[ 7, 8 ], [ -10, 33 ]], 
 Suppose, for example that I&#x27;d like to multiply each number by 777. What is the simplest way to achieve this?
 By simplest way, I mean writing no (or very little amount of) lisp code. Maybe there is an already existing package which solves the same (or similar) problem.
 One way I see is to convert this into an org table, and use org&#x27;s table capabilities to apply the math formula. But then I lose the format of the original buffer (I mean []&#x27;s, etc.). Losing the format is not a huge problem, but it would be better if the formatting was retained.

                    <span>For those (few?) of you running Fedora Silverblue, it might have happened that you lose track of which Emacs instance belongs to which toolbox container. 
 I came up with this code (feedback welcomed!) that I added to the :config section of my (use-package emacs...) block:
 (defvar hoagie-container-name nil &quot;Stores the name of the current container, if present.&quot;) (when (file-exists-p &quot;/run/.containerenv&quot;) ;; from http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_read_file_content.html ;; insert content in temp buffer rather than open a file (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents &quot;/run/.containerenv&quot;) (search-forward &quot;name&#x3D;&quot;) ;; move point to the line with the name (setq hoagie-container-name (cl-subseq (thing-at-point &#x27;line) 6 -2)))) ;; Identify the toolbox container for this Emacs instance in the frame title (setq frame-title-format &#x27;(&quot; %b @ &quot; (:eval hoagie-container-name)) icon-title-format &#x27;(&quot; %b @ &quot; (:eval hoagie-container-name)))) 
 I removed from my frame parameters (undecorated . t) for this. It could go in the modeline too, probably in misc-info: (push &#x27;(:eval hoagie-container-name) mode-line-misc-info).

 I haven&#x27;t gotten any groups to show up on the modeline. I&#x27;m not even sure how to test that the demon is running correctly with or without the notify package.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for two months now, for org-mode mostly and because I like Gnu projects. I haven&#x27;t learned Lisp yet and I&#x27;ve tried to customize Emacs Vanilla by reading and adding other people&#x27;s code. 
 This is my init.el and I&#x27;m going to add more code later, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s well written but until now I&#x27;ve got no errors and everything seems to work correctly.
 There is one thing at the moment that I still haven&#x27;t figured out. I would like to set a light theme for the org-mode buffer and keep the dark background for the other modes. 
 How would you modify my code to achieve this?

                    <span>I use org and org-roam v2 fairly extensively, and I&#x27;ve started thinking a little about how I might track some quantified-self metrics to play around with. 
 An example of this kind-of setup is Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s, detailed here: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/
 Or more generally: https://quantifiedself.com/
 I want to start tracking little aspects of myself in an open format, ideally co-located with my other notes. It&#x27;s fairly important that I can query the data I&#x27;m storing so that I can look for interesting bits of data or trends.
 A MVP of this might be a random prompt for a handful of questions: * How do you feel right now? 0-3 * How energetic do you feel right now? 0-3
 How might y&#x27;all implement something like this? Appending answers to a table using org-capture templates perhaps? Any tips or tricks? Have you implemented anything that rhymes with my thinking here?

                    <span>English is not my first language, so I hope I can describe my problem reasonably well, since I found it kind of hard to do even in my native language :D
 I have a toy project in Scala 3 and JavaFX. Not bad, but writing JavaFX in code is quite verbose, and FXML is even worse. So I thought I could devise a small dsl then expand it as I go, very similar to the builder pattern example on the Scala 3 reference. For example, I would like to write
 hbox { label { text &#x3D; &quot;Label&quot; } tableView[TestItem] { items ++&#x3D; Seq( TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;A&quot;)), TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;B&quot;)), TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;C&quot;)) ) tableColumn[TestItem, String] { text &#x3D; &quot;Column&quot; cellValueFactory[TestItem, String](_.getValue.a) } } }

 I have made a very small project : https://github.com/dionesh12/ETLFramework.
 If anyone could go through it and recommend as to how i should improve or should i quit while i am ahead if its really bad i will be extremely grateful

                    <span>I have been a python programmer for over a decade.
 I ventured into the world of scala a couple of years ago when I went in search for a better faster programming language and fell in love with functional programming. Now I work quite a lot in Scala.
 And yet, the ease of python is undeniable. So I was wondering if there was a way to call scala programs from python like you can do with c modules (with pybind for instance).
 I ran into ScalaPy but this does the opposite ie. It enables calling python routines from scala. I am looking for the opposite.
 I figured ScalaNative would perhaps enable this since this does not depend on JVM. Futhermore, I guess it is also faster then Scala. Can any one point me in the right direction?

                    <span>Hi All, In Scala, I am trying understand the usage of companion object for class, trait and case class . All I know is by using the companion object with we can access the private methods and variables of companion object and can access in class/trait/case class . I want to organize my code based on the features provided by them but not sure how. For example, I am writing all my utility methods in object and service method in classes which is fine but end up writing too many functions in object(for utilities). From the real time application development perspective how can we take advantage of the features of companion object, case class, class and trait to organize the code.
 And is there additional features/ difference for the companion object across those three

                    <span>Super glad to be part of this community of top-level researchers! Hope to become as good as you soon.
I have a couple of questions, however;
I don&#x27;t want to start with a digital zettelkasten, so I&#x27;ve started the process of acquiring a novelink box and index cards from Amazon. But info online is considerably vague. I know I&#x27;m to use my fleeting notes for quick ideas or notes as they come, then my literature note is for learning purposes before transferring to my permanent note, then finally transfer singular ideas into my zettels. My question is how do I use this while reading a book or taking an online course? What do I need to transfer between these notes? How do I know I&#x27;m taking the ideal note? Do I look at it from the context of why I&#x27;m studying the note/book/course, or I&#x27;m to maintain an open mind?
Also, I don&#x27;t know if there are copywriters in this group, but how can I use this method to boost my research ability? How do you use your zettelkasten system to research?
Thanks for your answers!</span>

                    <span>What are the main differences between org-reveal (the one that&#x27;s still maintained) and org-re-reveal?
 Is one better/easier to use? I&#x27;ve only used org-reveal because that seems to be the most recommended/popular, and it works mostly fine, though I find the documentation rather poor.

                    <span>I am currently trying kotllin for competitive programming and I need a new file for each new problem. However lsp-mode keeps telling me &quot;Conflicting declarations: public val OUTPUT: PrintStream!, public val OUTPUT: PrintStream!.&quot; for every global variable or function (OUTPUT is defined both in A/main.kt and B/main.kt). Is there a way to bypass this? If not, then I probably need to run different language server for every problem file/directory. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do that. Is there an option to specify project root while starting lsp-mode?

                    <span>Following the variable help for notmuch-fcc-dirs
 &gt; If ‘notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert’ is set (the default) then
 &gt; the header should be of the form &quot;folder +tag1 -tag2&quot; where
 &gt; folder is the folder (relative to the notmuch mailstore) to store
 &gt; the message in, and tag1 and tag2 are tag changes to apply to the
 &gt; stored message.
 I have the following line:
 notmuch-fcc-dirs &#x27;((&quot;.*&quot; . &quot;sent -unread&quot;))
 To save my mail in sent and remove the unread tag. However when I send an email it asks me if I want to create the directory and it creates &#x27;sent -unread&#x27;. As opposed to creating &#x27;sent&#x27; and removing the tag unread. notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert is set to t.
 If I remove the -unread it works fine. Is my syntax wrong?
 Thanks.

                    <span>When I have to decrypt a file using gpg, I can&#x27;t use the Emacs shell buffer, because it is a dumb shell that cannot handle interactive prompt. 
 To solve this, I use the term mode for any interactive command. But is there any ways to use Emacs shell to enter gpg passphase?
 I have read some materials about pinentry-emacs. However, most of them are outdated.

                    <span>Hello guys! how are yall doing?
 Well I am a new user to emacs, I use a lot of text editing, mainly VSCODE and mainly with git. 
 I am currently facing an issue with Magit and I wanna ask you if you can point me out to a solution as I already did some research but found nothing.
 So, I have a repo cloned using HTTPS protocol. I can push new branches to origin normally using the command &quot;git push origin [branch-name]&quot;.
 Now when I try to push my branch using magit, (P u - type the upstream branch name - [RET]) I am getting:
 (fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights
 and the repository exists.)
 I found some people having issues like this one but when using SSH protocol for their repos, but in my case as, I said, I am using HTTPS protocol and it works normally using terminal.
 If you can point me out to a solution for this issue I would appreciate it :)
 the log shows me this...
 git … push -v --set-upstream [my-branch]\:refs/heads/
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi
 Working in Windows emacs 27.2
 I would love to use the functionality of radio targets in my org file. If you dont know it see: https://orgmode.org/manual/Radio-Targets.html
 Therefore I have heading * dictionary &gt;&gt; bla blub * my org text Text mydefinition is then highlighted as link.
 Now the problem
 When I klick the link on mydefinition. I would expect it to jump to the position of &gt;&gt; 
 Instead emacs pops a file dialog and asks for &quot;Visit TAGS table&quot;
 Generating TAGS files seems rocket science to me and Documentation is really scattered and not consistent at all for this. For windows even worse. Does anybody use this? Is it outdated functionality or could it be configured to just work out of the box? Does it work on linux without special installations?
 Thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;ve set up emacs for python using python-language-server and lsp. When I open a python file, the top line of emacs shows the directory elements and the file name. The file name will have a squiggly line under it if the file is not formatted correctly. But also the directory elements have squiggly lines under them (whether or not the file name does). Sometimes they go away, but I&#x27;m not sure what I do that makes them go away. What do the squiggly lines under the directory elements mean and how to make them go away? Thanks

                    <span>Hi all,
 Major noob here looking for some pointers on their first project. The aim of the project is to pull data down from multiple entity&#x27;s public REST APIs (let&#x27;s call them cryptocurrency exchanges). For each entity, I have to make numerous individual API calls without breaching that entity&#x27;s API rate limit. The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.
 Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? 
 If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity&#x27;s rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>This is easily unnoticed in the new Scala 3 documentation and I think its worth a shout out:
  
Scala 2&#x27;s somewhat puzzling behavior with respect to ambiguity has been exploited to implement the analogue of a &quot;negated&quot; search in implicit resolution, where a query Q1 fails if some other query Q2 succeeds and Q1 succeeds if Q2 fails. With the new cleaned up behavior these techniques no longer work. But there is now a new special type scala.util.NotGiven which implements negation directly. For any query type Q, NotGiven[Q] succeeds if and only if the implicit search for Q fails.

                    <span>Introduction
 When I saw opaque types and inline methods, I quickly thook about type-level assertions evaluated at compile time. I was pretty hyped by this idea so I made Iron.
 Iron uses Dotty&#x27;s inline and opaque types to create almost zero-overhead (and true zero-overhead for the next Scala 3 release) type constraints for Scala. It also supports runtime constraints.
 Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean &quot;without macro/black magic&quot;). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.
 Usage
 Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.
 Example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*
 inline def log(x: Double &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Greater[0d]): Double &#x3D; Math.log(x) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>Not strictly a Zettelkasten, but almost. I was ready &quot;How to write mathematics&quot; by P. R. Halmos. and on page 134, he discusses how he organizes a book or long article:

  
At one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it&#x27;s mentioned.


Emphasis mine.
It is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>Hi, emacs newbie here. I wanted to start using emacs for c, c++, scheme and python programming and first researched auto-completion extensions. I came across auto-complete and company-mode, but most of the discussions I found about them (even on this subreddit) were very old. There were discussions about company-mode being easier, but not supporting docstrings.
 I just want to know as of 2021, how good they are, what about speed? memory? do they work in terminals? how easy are they? does company-mode now support docstrings? Any feedback would be really appreciated.

                    <span>I recently installed emacs and doom emacs on top of it. And its cool and all but i have one question. When ever i launch emacs why is it that the vanilla emacs first starts and then the doom emacs screen comes up? Is that normal? Like when i launch emacs first theres like the normal emacs you get without doom and then like 5 seconds later doom emacs launches.

                    <span>Is it possible to configure whitespace-mode to display only leading whitespace? When displaying whitespace, I find that the space indicators in between words is a bit too much and makes it harder to read, but I really like the idea of just seeing leading whitespace to check indentation etc.
 I&#x27;ve played around with the whitespace-style customization option a fair bit, but haven&#x27;t managed to do what I want. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>The problem occurs with the pcase-let binding in the function below. In the original source buffer it fails to bind and the variables are nil. I copied over the function into another buffer, re-evaluated, and it works. I can only guess it has something to do with the back-quote but I have no idea. Anyone know?
 ​
 (defun org-xob-refile-region () &quot;Move text in region to the end of the top section of a selected node.&quot; (interactive) (org-xob-with-xob-on (when (use-region-p) (pcase-let ((&#x60;(,ID ,title) (org-xob--get-create-node))) &lt;-- binding (when (bound-and-true-p ID) &lt;-- nil (kill-region (point) (mark)) (save-window-excursion (org-with-wide-buffer (org-id-goto ID) (if (org-goto-first-child) (progn (newline 2) (forward-line -1)) (org-end-of-subtree) (newline)) (org-xob--smart-paste)))) ))))

                    <span>For example, I would always like to start firefox in char mode by default, while the other applications in line mode, what can I do?
 Do I need to add a hook to everytime when exwm is opening a new buffer and compare the buffer name with regex? Or is there a default way to do such a thing? I have read the exwm wiki but found no useful guidelines.

                    <span>I apologize if this is a trivial question, but I know very little about web-development, javascript, node.js, etc. 
 Is there anyway I can set up the ox-reveal package so I can open the html file on the browser once and it&#x27;s updated every time I change and save the .org file?
 Thanks.

                    <span>I started getting the titled message from a few days ago every time I clock out a task. I did not make any changes to my config lately, but I did pulled the org repo. (i&#x27;m using straight.el) 
 It seems to me the error is from the org-clock-remove-empty-clock-drawer function within the org-clock-out-hook. 
 And removing the function from the hook does fix the issue immediately. 
 It seems the hook is being executed when the current buffer is the Org Note buffer instead of the org buffer. 
 is anyone else getting this? 
 I was able to reproduce the issue with these steps: 
  
Download https://orgmode.org/org-9.4.6.tar.gz and extract to ~/org-9.4.6
 
Start emacs 27 with emacs -Q 
 evaluate (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/org-9.4.6/lisp&quot;)
 create a new org file, create a heading and clock in 
 evaluate (setq org-log-note-clock-out t) 
 clock out. 
  
I&#x27;m using WSL2/Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows. this shouldn&#x27;t be relevant though.

                    <span>Hi!
 My assumption is that Haskell has no support for a scenario where a client ought to be authenticated (certificate send and verified) as part of establishing a TLS connection. OnCertificateRequest function does not seem to be called back.
 We see a lot of code examples such as this one:
  creds  return creds , onServerCertificate &#x3D; \_ _ _ _ -&gt; return [] } clientParams &#x3D; (defaultParamsClient hostName &quot;&quot;) { clientHooks &#x3D; hooks , clientSupported &#x3D; def { supportedCiphers &#x3D; ciphersuite_all } } tlsSettings &#x3D; TLSSettings clientParams 
 For Windows 10 and ghc 8.4.3 has someone gotten onCertificateRequest called back?

 Juuso

                    <span>I finally got around to play a bit with and found that it needed some tweaks on Spacemacs, here&#x27;s what I am using at the moment:
 In my layers I use just this:

 I found that this helps quite a bit (in user-config):

                    <span>I have the desire for a top level function. It feels artificial to me to put it in an object that I have to name with an arbitrary noun when I just want to refer to it by its verb method name. So I was toying with this pattern.
 object FormatCurrency { private lazy val instance &#x3D; NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance def apply(num: BigDecimal): String &#x3D; instance.format(num) } 
 so I can call it like FormatCurrency(1.00).
 What do y&#x27;all think? Should it be formatCurrency to make it look more like a function and less like a class constructor?

                    <span>I recently, added projectile, counsel, and vterm to my emacs configuration. I am quite happy with these recent additions, and everything has been going very well.
 Except today, while pair programming in C I discovered that my setup chokes on C files. Emacs runs full tilt using %100 of a core, and the session can no longer be used. I disabled projectile and company (I never have clang installed anyway), but that didn&#x27;t do anything. I can&#x27;t find any crash reports; I presume because emacs is in some infinite loop, so there is no way for it to make a report.
 Anyway, I ran emacs in a terminal with -q to do the hour or so of work in C today (it is not my primary language at work), but I am pretty stumped about what is wrong. I hope someone here has a clue what is happening. I sure as hell don&#x27;…</span>

                    <span>I am trying to set up ox-hugo to auto export files in my org-roam directory. Ox-hugo provides the org-hugo-auto-export-mode function/variable for this purpose. As such, I want to enable this for every org file in the org roam directory but only in that directory. I found here that this can be done with 
 ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))
 added to the directory&#x27;s .dir-locals.el
 After trying this, it simply didn&#x27;t work for me. I have tried restarting as well and with this code snippet, the mode simply doesnt get activated. My problem is this is the first time I have worked with directory local variables/modes and I can&#x27;t find another way to do this online. 
 Anyone have a clue why this isn&#x27;t working. I would love if I could properly do this. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hello! I just started using Emacs and have a noob question:
 How to configure Emacs to automatically close brackets like in VS code or other text editors?
 I switched from Vim to the latest version of Doom Emacs and didn&#x27;t like the behavior of auto-closing brackets. Specifically, I don&#x27;t like two things:
 - Auto erasing closing bracket(&#x27;|&#x27; -&gt; cursor):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c++ int main() { {| } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; becomes: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c++ int main() { | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
  
No new line with indentation after pressing Shift+Enter:
 c++ int main() { { |} } 
 Just Enter:
 c++ int main() { { | } } 
 
 I tried several solutions from the internet, but neither of them worked as I wanted(I also tried hacking on them, but it was really hard because I am a noob in Elisp and Emacs). My requirements are not that high, though: - Add a closing bracket - Add new line and indent after I press Enter (and Shift+Enter) - Don&#x27;t remove the closing bracket when I erase the opening one (I usually start erasing from the closing bracket and when I reach opening one, it removes the next closing bracket)
 In vim, I used simple bindings:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &quot; brackets
 inoremap &quot; &quot;&quot; inoremap &#x27; &#x27;&#x27; inoremap ( () inoremap [ [] inoremap { {} inoremap { {}O inoremap {; {};O 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I tried to implement it in Emacs but couldn&#x27;t. Will appreciate some help.
 Is there a good way for auto closing brackets in Emacs?
 EDIT: I think electric pair suits me. As for me, smartparens&#x27; behavior is really annoying: it deletes closing pair and acts strange. I figured out how to turn off it in Doom Emacs: lisp (remove-hook &#x27;doom-first-buffer-hook #&#x27;smartparens-global-mode) (smartparens-global-mode -1) 
 One thing left: I want auto indentation after pressing Shift+Enter too.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to set up for python development. Everything is working fine so far, only flycheck is giving me some headaches. I&#x27;m using lsp, so flycheck defaults to using lsp as it&#x27;s checker. But I want to use flake8 as the default checker, which depends on the virtual environment to be loaded before. The environment is automatically loaded using direnv. I tried this to select flake8 as default:
 (add-hook &#x27;pyhon-mode-local-vars-hook (lambda () (when (flycheck-may-enable-checker &#x27;python-flake8) (flycheck-select-checker &#x27;python-flake8)))) 
 However it doesn&#x27;t select the checker and I have to do it manually (M-x flycheck-select-checker). I also tried disabling the lsp checker completely and to always select flake8 (without checking if it can be enabled) but it still doesn&#x27;t work. I guess what causes a problem is that flake8 cannot be selected until the environment is loaded, since the executable is in the virtual environment. Is there any way I could still make it load flake8 automatically?

                    <span>Background: With projectile, I usually use projectile-grep or projectile-ag to search for stuff in my code bases or blogs. Thanks to wgrep etc., I can then edit the results in place and perform changes to my project next to any occurrence of the search terms.
 Observation: I noticed that with Emacs&#x27;s new-ish built-in project.el stuff, there&#x27;s C-x p g to perform a regex search (project-find-regexp) without grep in a project. The resulting buffer is using xref-mode. It looks rather nice and tidy. But there&#x27;s no built-in wgrep equivalent to make it editable.
 Question: Is there a wgrep, but for xref-mode? Web search yields confusing results because &#x27;xref&#x27; hashistorically been the name of a couple of things in Emacs land. Help by ye all would be appreciated!

                    <span>Recently, I found out about haskell and got intrigued to find more about it. I was also fascinated with Xmonad so I been tweaking in it. But I&#x27;m having a bit hard time to understand the codes of different modules so I thought it would be best to know the basics of the language as such would help me to understand the codes as well as make me more able. Can you all suggest me books that I can refer to as a novice in this field? 
 I know this question has been asked quite a few times but it all dated atleast 5 years ago or so. It&#x27;s 2021 and many things have changed so I&#x27;m looking for any book which is totally updated and beginners friendly. Please consider myself as total novice in the programming world as I had very little exposure to programming. I know a bit of C and Bash and I used it mainly to make my life easier on Linux by building small scripts. Any sort of help is totally appreciated.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m coming back to my haskell project after some months and hitting the good ol&#x27; &quot;wow this is a giant mess, I should totally revamp this&quot;.
 I&#x27;m realising basically everything I write is of the type foo :: a -&gt; b -&gt; m c for some huge m ~ ReaderT BigOlRecordType1 (StateT BigOlRecordType2 IO).
 This seems like...a huge oversight. For reference, the thing I&#x27;m working on is a text adventure, so the big abstraction I have is a game world populated by objects. If I want to go query some property of some object, I have to lug around this huge monad stack. It doesn&#x27;t feel very haskell-y. Rather than handling propertyCheck :: SomeSpecificObject -&gt; Bool, I&#x27;m doing things like HasSomeSpecificObject w m &#x3D;&gt; EntityID -&gt; m Bool.
 Am I missing something here? It&#x27;d be great if I could deal with little fu…</span>

 These are companies that are hiring right now, and they are all Haskell related, even if they list additional stacks.
 I was honestly a bit surprised how many there were.

I was trying to do some cool Data Analysis pipelines on Scala as a practice but I can&#x27;t seem to find any libraries or learning resources for the exploratory data analysis phase, nor the feature engineering and selection.
 I wonder if anyone here is aware of any libraries/notebooks or other materials showing tools to do EDA (especially visualization) and preprocessing on Scala. Thanks

                    <span>Hello, 
 I have a codebase that&#x27;s quite old now that uses akka http with Futures as a main IO monad and throwing exceptions for error handling.
 I would like to improve on this and have been looking into other options like using Monad Error. However I am wondering how I can handle this because it seems to me in akka http youre obliged to create an exception handler. Also, I am not sure Monad Error will be compatible with the monad used by the app (Future) 
 Any suggestions or code samples i can get inspiration from?

                    <span>I&#x27;m studying Scala with the Coursera specialization. I want to start with scala because 2 reasons: 1) functional programming and 2) higher salaries. I think in November I will complete the specialization. I have 10 years of experience with .NET, Angular, Python, and some Julia. I&#x27;m Latin American, very well paid for Latin American standards. My question is... how do you focus the career plan to get a remote job with North American salaries with North American company?
 ​
 I&#x27;m paid above average for national standards, but the average at the USA is much higher... I would be happy to find a Job with a USA-average salary.....

                    <span>What is a lawless type class, and should they be avoided? Are orphan instances
inherently evil, or just misunderstood? Is global coherence a mistake or a
fundamental requirement? In this post we argue that most of the arguments over
these questions stem from the fact that type classes embody a number of
disparate concepts, with each facet giving rise to perceived wisdom which does
not necessarily map to other facets. We look at the various concepts which are
combined in type classes, and posit how one might disentangle them.

Functions from Types to Values
Consider the following diagram:

 |          |

 ▿          |
Value ---&gt; Value

Haskell has been steadily filling out the arrows here. From Value to Value we

Is this the best way to reference other Zettels? I know the question is subjective. Just looking for a clean way to say:

  
This idea links to zettel &quot;B&quot; and here&#x27;s the ID and Title. Revisions welcome.

 Hope you find this interesting :)

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get lip-mode to work with Go. Here is a snippet from my .emacs config:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ; Packages. (setq package-list &#x27;( lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-ivy magit flycheck company ivy swiper counsel projectile ))
 ; Package repositories. (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;)))
 ; Activate all packages. (package-initialize)
 ; Refresh list of available packages. (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents))
 ; Install any missing packages. (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package)))
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; PLUGINS ;; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
 ; Enable plugins globally. (ivy-mode) (global-flycheck-mode)
 ;; Company Mode (global-company-mode) (setq company-idle-delay 0) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
 ; Load a language server if one is available. (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It seems like this installed the packages I want, but I can&#x27;t tell if lsp-mode is working. Do I need (package-initialize)? I also see other configures calling (require lsp-mode). I tried doing that and it said symbol undefined.
 Any help?

                    <span>I have many markdown files with pure formatting.
 I have something like this.
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing ![Image name](image.png) ![Image name](image.png) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing ![Image name](image.png) ![Image name](image.png) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing 
 I want an interactive function which will insert empty lines bellow and above images.
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing ![Image name](image.png) ![Image name](image.png) 
 Edited:  
 This looks closer to what I want but will insert empty lines even if an image is already surrounded with empty lines :(

                    <span>I have no idea what this option is called 
 A previous emacs install I used would let me format (Perl) quoted text with spaces or tabs so I could write 
 my $sql &#x3D; &quot;SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz &#x3D; &#x27;done&#x27;&quot;; 
 Hitting tab on those lines would not change the formatting 
 However currently if I hit tab on those lines it changes it to an ugly
 my $sql &#x3D; &quot;SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz &#x3D; &#x27;done&#x27;&quot;; 
 I could use heredoc, but was wondering if there was option I needed to disable.

                    <span>I am working on an NBT parser for Minecraft and I wanted to test my implementation. There is an official test file, but that one is far from code coverage and I had since tried to find the best way to create my own files. These are some examples (ignore .bin files).
 I tried to use hexdump and some other GUI tool which were not very useful imo. The best luck I had was with a custom c++ code but the issue I had was that code is since broken, besides its not the best idea to rewrite source .txt and forget to update the .bin. Which led me to writing my own elisp file editor.
 A binary file would look like this:
 0a 00 00 01 00 00 11 00 ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | end of vector | | byte data | following data will be a byte vector // Those 00 00 are lengths of names of vector and byte // but i removed the names to make it fit on the line // More details in the NBT specs. 
 The above would be diplayed like this:
 0a 0000 01 0000 11 00 
 Or like this: ([%] means vector, b means byte)
 [%] &quot;&quot; { b &quot;&quot; 0x11 } 
 Or:
 [%] &quot;&quot; { b &quot;&quot; 17 } 
 So it should be at least hexadecimal, indented and separated into lines, but I would also add some readability.
 Optional: While editing the file I would like to safeguard myself and do checks on the data that I insert. Maybe even a separate buffer like in calc for stack and trail, but for insert/edit and view.

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a long time Vim user who switched to (DOOM)Emacs yesterday and I am looking for a way to translate all of my UltiSnips LaTeX snippets to yasnippet. So far I figured out how make basic snippets which can be expanded by pressing TAB and snippets which expand only in certain environments like the math environment but I can&#x27;t figure out how to translate my more complicated snippets which expand automatically. Here is an UltiSnips example:
 snippet / &quot;Fraction&quot; i
 \\frac{${VISUAL}}{$1}$0
 endsnippet
 What this one does is the following: If type 1/ it will automatically expand to \frac{1}{} . Another example is the ket:
 priority 100
 context &quot;math()&quot;
 snippet &quot;\|(.*?)\&gt;&quot; &quot;ket&quot; riA
 \ket{\!p[snip.rv&#x3D;match.group](https://snip.rv&#x3D;match.group)(1)\}\&#x60;&#x60;
 endsnippet
 This gives me \ket{a} when I type |a&gt; . I&#x27;m sure there must be a way to write snippets like these in yasnippet but I haven&#x27;t found any examples of such snippets.

                    <span>Being a user of multiple-cursors.el, I have always been envious of evil-mc&#x27;s abilities to pause fake cursors and allow free movements for the real one but that evil variant doesn&#x27;t suit me because it doesn&#x27;t play well with non-evil commands (like sp-kill-sexp).
 After scavenging on the Internet without success results, I decided to write those myself: after-multiple-cursors-core.el
 Although a hack, the idea is simple: Just extract cursor positions from mc/all-fake-cursors&#x27;s output and save it in an association list (maybe we don&#x27;t need a hash table since it&#x27;s not too often, and buffer-local variables are lost when we revert the buffer; and yes there&#x27;s the limitation of editing will render positions incorrect, but I think we don&#x27;t need to handle that case) with buffer objects as keys.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I have an LG 2k 34-inch ultra-wide monitor, which I have setup sideways in portait-mode(which I setup with xrandr).
 Anyways, how do I correctly setup emacs for it to look better? 
 The text does not fit correctly on the screen, so it looks messy.
 I&#x27;m going to try out different font sizes, but I was wondering if other elisp packages/configurations would help with this particular setup?
 I heard about horizontal scrolling, but I need to look more into it.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>At this year&#x27;s HasuraCon we&#x27;re doing a workshop on how to extend the Hasura GraphQL-Engine with support for a new database backend.
 At the workshop (on 2021-06-24, 16:00-17:00 UTC), /u/nicuveo and /u/plcplc will be going through the parts of the design of the Hasura GraphQL-Engine that enable backend modularity, and showcasing the work needed to develop a backend for SQLite from scratch.
 Those interested can head to https://hasura.io/events/hasura-con-2021/register/ and register for the conference, which spans the two days of Wednesday 2021-06-23 and Thursday 2021-06-24.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working to understand the theory behind algebraic effects, with the understanding that that&#x27;s what Polysemy&#x27;s based on. I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m fundamentally confused. 
 Following through citations (Polysemy cites Kiselyov and Ishii, who cite Kammar, Lindley, and Oury, who cite various papers by Plotkin and Pretnar) strongly suggests that &quot;extensible effects&quot; are just a rebranding of &quot;algebraic effects&quot;, and that equational reasoning gets left out of implementations because that&#x27;s more practical (but Polysemy&#x27;s trying to add it back?). Is this a good understanding of the situation?
 Similarly, in Petnar&#x27;s representations of algebraic effects (e.g.), it&#x27;s quite important that the handlers have access to the computation&#x27;s continuation, and get to decide how it&#x27;s used. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any support for this in Polysemey, but everything&#x27;s phrased so differently it&#x27;s difficult to search. 
 Any suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and practice, or for quickly getting up to speed on the last twenty years of research in this area?

                    <span>A new release of fakedata has been released: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata
 Brief Summary of what fakedata is: It&#x27;s a library for producing fake data such as names, addresses and phone numbers.
 The changelog contains the list of changes in this release: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata/releases/tag/v1.0
 Note that this release contains breaking change. I have documented it with more detail in the changelog entry. The most interesting one is making Fake type as a transformer which allows writing efficient code more easily. This was done by Isaac Van Bakel and more details are here: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata#using-the-faket-transformer
 The current release also adds various new modules (+ 15), locale improvements and contains updates to fake data sources. Also, the test suite has been enhanced which helped me find bugs in the upstream Ruby data sources (Corresponding fix: https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/pull/2339) . And thanks to Tristan de Cacqueray for fixing the test failure issues related to random 1.2.0 as part of ZuriHac.
 The following packages can be used to create generators out of fakedata:
 * quickcheck integration by Jappie Klooster: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata-quickcheck
 * hedgehog integration by Matt Parsons: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hedgehog-fakedata

 I am using Doom Emacs with (org +pretty) and org-autolist installed (disabling this didn&#x27;t seem to change behavior) if that is relevant.
 I am kinda new to org-mode so apologies if this is dumb. Any help is appreciated including alternate ideas.
 Thank you.

                    <span>I just found Orgzly and would like to use it as a diary/journal.
 I like that I can add entries quickly into my Diary note using the + widget.
 However when I go into the app, I&#x27;d like to see my entries listed by date (with the creation date on the left), instead of as a bullet list... What am I missing?
 Note that I&#x27;m not talking about scheduled tasks/events. I&#x27;d just like to do simple journal entries, and see them in a journal format.
 PS: I&#x27;m posting here because this sub seems to be the most active with Orgzly. To be honest I don&#x27;t really know what orgmode is!

                    <span>I use doom emacs and use org mode in it. I have the below configuration for TODO states.
 (setq org-todo-keywords
 &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;PROJ(p)&quot; &quot;NEXT(n)&quot; &quot;WAIT(w)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot; &quot;CANC(c)&quot;)))
 The fast access to TODO states as mentioned in https://orgmode.org/manual/Fast-access-to-TODO-states.html#Fast-access-to-TODO-states doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me anymore. When I do &quot;SPC m t&quot; it just tries to cycle through the available TODO states TODO-&gt;PROJ-&gt;NEXT ... and not ask for a shortcut letter to my desired state.
 I remember this stopped working after I did a fresh install of doom emacs, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to doom emacs. Any pointers on where to look at?

                    <span>It&#x27;s a small thing and I don&#x27;t know why it bothers me. 
 When I create a list and I hit enter to start the next item, it always indents the cursor. Is there a way to stop this?

                    <span>Hi all!
 I wonder what is the right/common way to collect outputs from multiple asynchronous processes (which may run concurrently) into one log buffer. So far I have found three options:
  
Associate all the processes with the log buffer (as the process buffer). This is discouraged in the manual and indeed seems like a bad idea (it may interleave the outputs).
 
Create a unique process buffer for each process and copy the output from the process buffer to the log buffer at the end in the process sentinel. The problem is that we may have lots of buffers left. It seems to work if we kill the buffer as well in the sentinel, but I am not sure if that works reliably. Here is a sample of this solution:
 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (require &#x27;cl-lib) (defconst output-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*output*&quot;)) (defun copy…</span>

 my emacs config is pretty much vanilla, I&#x27;m just using python-mode. Any ideas? thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to disable a specific behavior in *eshell* buffer, that is very much similar to the result of applying the comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom in inferior buffers, like M-x shell or M-x ielm (and others alike).
 For the buffers that use comint mode, I can simple remove-hook from the comint-output-filter-functions, and whenever I use C-l C-l to recenter current line to be the top one, and evaluate some expression, I like that the top line I was on is still the top line (unless the expression result is bigger than the window height).
 *eshell* always moves current line to the bottom first, then prints the result of the command, which is a bit annoying, as I mostly use it in a long vertical buffer, and going from the top to the bottom visually is very distracting. Clearing previous output is not an option, because I want to refer to it occasionally.
 But I can&#x27;t seem to find anything in eshell that corresponds to this feature, and it doesn&#x27;t use comint either, so any help would be great. Thanks!

                    <span>while googling around, i stumbled upon a project called rmsbolt https://gitlab.com/jgkamat/rmsbolt
 it&#x27;s like godbolt but it is extendable, supports multiple languages, written in elisp and is completely offline. thought i&#x27;d share my discovery :)

                    <span>Unless there are links in the help screens to related functions it is always necessary to use C-h f to search for the related function you want to look at.
 e.g the screen for set-buffer contains links to with-current-buffer, pop-buffer and switch-to-buffer. So if you want to view current-buffer or save-to-current-buffer you have to use C-h f to get them.
 Even more annoying is the set-x family of commands. set, setq, setq-local, setq-default etc.
 Isn&#x27;t there some way around this, eg, setting some advice where on displaying a page you could display your own manual or automatically generated links below them.

                    <span>I am begining go find Emacs key combinations such as Ctrl-Alt-Shift-&#x27; (mark-sexp) too awkward and I&#x27;m now looking at different key schemes such as modalka, god-mode, ryo-modal etc.
 With modalka there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any particular leader key, though I suspect I haven&#x27;t read it well enough or understand it.

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting a really weird issue with my package with Unicode on GHC 9.0.1.
 Where I expect to see, respectively
  
β (or \946) and
 γ (or \947)
  
I instead see
  
β?KQHTLXOCBJSPDZRAMEWNIUYGV and
 γ?EYJVCNIXWPBQMDRTAKZGFUHOS
  
and the appended strings come from elsewhere in my code!
 This one really has me stumped, and any help is much appreciated! It feels like something deep in how Unicode is stored, unless it&#x27;s just my bad code (which has worked fine since GHC 7.10.3).

                    <span>I think this is a pretty straight forward yes or no question, so here goes: as a beginner I&#x27;m starting to see the cleanliness of defining point-free functions. Somtimes I&#x27;m having trouble doing it though, especially when the input variable needs to be fed to multiple intermediate functions, like when you&#x27;d want to find the average of an Int array:
 avg :: [Int] -&gt; Double avg xs &#x3D; fromIntegral (sum xs) / (fromIntegral (length xs)) 
 So I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to do it at all, or if I should even bother.

                    <span>Is the system described in https://youtu.be/sl2zo7tzrO8 still up and running in Facebook? I want to make sure I don&#x27;t provide outdated information when advocating Haskell.
 There are 2 aspects to this:
  
Is Haskell still being used for Spam Filtering?
 Is the system still using Static Rules? Or all static rules are gone and replaced with ML models?
  
Two friends who left Facebook at 2016 gave me contradicting information, one said it was replaced with ML written in C++, and the other said the system is still up and running. So I am asking here to see if anyone has more recent information.

                    <span>(Background issue I&#x27;m facing: https://github.com/snapframework/snap-core/issues/309)
 I think the functionality of MonadUnliftIO is exactly what I want, but unfortunately Snap appears not eligible for:
  
the intuition is that a monad must have no monadic state, but may have monadic context. This essentially limits MonadUnliftIO to ReaderT and IdentityT transformers on top of IO.
  
Then I found Snap has a MonadBaseControl instance, and thought it should work for me. But sadly to find it losing states. Also I failed to find a user side example of MonadBaseControl on Github (as there&#x27;re only instance impl. hits), so I have not way to verify whether that&#x27;s due to my incorrect usage.
 Any way quoting u/snoyberg : https://github.com/fpco/unliftio/issues/17#issuecomment-363655106

                    <span>Hi all, this is a minor question but am curious. I have beorg on my iPhone 6, and every time I start it it takes a number of seconds to sync, even if nothing has changed, and then a few more seconds to “settle down” Usually I hope to quickly add a note, and then move on, so it has some slight friction for usage. Especially when I close and reopen to add another thing — same long wait though nothing has changed. Any thoughts? My org files are not particularly large.

                    <span>Can I, as an historian, use a Zettelkasten for my research?  For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the Zettelkasten &#x27;method&#x27; described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.
The first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…</span>

                    <span>I use pass to store all my passwords. I&#x27;ve started setting up gnus, and I&#x27;ve got it working, though I don&#x27;t want to have to manually write down my passwords in ~/.authinfo. This isn&#x27;t a security issue -- I know I could encrypt it and use ~/.authinfo.gpg -- it&#x27;s a convenience thing. I don&#x27;t want to have to manually change the settings as well as updating my pass database every time I change my passwords (quite often).
 So, is there a way to have gnus read in my pass?
 Come to that, I used to use neomutt, which didn&#x27;t need ~/.authinfo, and all other information (usernames, smtp ports, etc.) could be stored in the config. Could I do this with gnus too and get rid of one more file altogether?
 TIA!

                    <span>Hey there,
 I often do this for work aka these two commands in an &#x27;ansi-term&#x27; session, but have to manually type them, hit enter, and wait for connections for both separate commands:
 gcloud compute ssh --project (name of 1st box) (name of 2nd box)
 ssh (alias for end point box)
 ​
 I&#x27;m being a bit vague because yeah, its for work. 
 But, can someone please help me figure out how I can add Tramp to this combination? Also, how could I configure it to a keyboard macro as well?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve used Tramp to remotely edit my website as if it were local, and I absolutely love it. Wanted to do the same thing and blow some coworkers minds about how you can do this. Reason being is that I can install anything on these endpoint boxes, so I figured maybe Tramp might come to the rescue for this situation.
 ​
 Thanks!

 relative line numbers on the right margin
 line numbers on all buffers, i.e on new/empty ones as well

Now, thanks to this great post on StackOverflow, I achieved points 1 and 2, but 3 I am absolutely unable to get and for 4, I can do it with Meta/Alt-x then linum-mode but not on startup. Kindly help for 3 and 4.

                    <span>Greetings Emacsians! I, emacs noob, am back with additional questions. I am configuring emacs to be my personal calendar and task management system. I really like the &quot;M-x org-agenda a&quot;
 view&#x27;s information, but I don&#x27;t like its formatting.
 First and foremost, long lines look terrible. I have &quot;word wrap visual line mode&quot; activated, which wraps lines in all org files. I also have the &quot;adaptive-wrap&quot; packaged installed and active, and that makes the text wrapping in normal org mode files look much better since indenting is respected. However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. 
 Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like &quot;adaptive-wrap&quot; does for ordinary org mode files?)
 Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I&#x27;d like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).
 (1) Since the todo&#x27;s are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the &quot;todo&quot; keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?
 (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?

 When changing the Gnome theme (I usually switch between &#x27;Adwaita&#x27; and &#x27;Adwaita Dark&#x27;), the Emacs frame decorations get updated accordingly (using 28.0 with pgtk), but the Emacs theme does not change.
 The configuration below sets up a DBus handler that is triggered when the Gnome GTK theme changes, and it sets the appropriate Modus theme.
 (use-package dbus) (use-package modus-themes :after (dbus) :config (defun set-modus-theme-from-gtk () &quot;Set modus theme by checking whether GTK theme is dark.&quot; (let ((gtk-theme (downcase (call-process-string &quot;gsettings&quot; &quot;get&quot; &quot;org.gnome.desktop.interface&quot; &quot;gtk-theme&quot;)))) (if (or (string-match-p &quot;dark&quot; gtk-theme) (string-match-p &quot;black&quot; gtk-theme)) (modus-themes-load-vivendi) (modus-themes-load-operandi)))) (defun gtk-theme-changed (path _ _) &quot;DBus handler to detect when the GTK theme has changed.&quot; (when (string-equal path &quot;/org/gnome/desktop/interface/gtk-theme&quot;) (set-modus-theme-from-gtk))) (dbus-register-signal :session &quot;ca.desrt.dconf&quot; &quot;/ca/desrt/dconf/Writer/user&quot; &quot;ca.desrt.dconf.Writer&quot; &quot;Notify&quot; #&#x27;gtk-theme-changed) (set-modus-theme-from-gtk)) (defun call-process-string (program &amp;rest args) &quot;Call process&#x60;PROGRAM&#x27; with &#x60;ARGS&#x27; and return the output as string.&quot; (with-temp-buffer (apply #&#x27;call-process program nil t nil args) (buffer-string)))

                    <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m pretty inexperienced with ELisp, so if you could help me out that would be great.
 I&#x27;m trying to create a function that I can call with a key binding that will prompt me for a buffer (I&#x27;m thinking (counsel-ibuffer) style), and open the buffer as a new split next to my current buffer. Since the native emacs split functions only take dimensions as arguments (so far as I can tell) and I use evil mode, here is what I have:
  (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (evil-split-buffer &#x27;(counsel-ibuffer))) 
 If you guys know of any way to get this working, please let me know. Thank you!
 EDIT: Resolved, thanks to u/flexibeast. Here is their code for people with this problem in the future:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (ivy-read &quot;Switch to buffer: &quot; (counsel-ibuffer--get-buffers) :history &#x27;counsel-ibuffer-history :action #&#x27;other-buff-to-split-1))
 (defun other-buff-to-split-1 (x) (evil-split-buffer (cdr x))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>I know Emacs can automatically decrypt .gpg file when I open it in dired. However, when I open a .gpg file, the mini buffer stuck at &quot;decrypting 0%&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t prompt me for the passphase no matter how long I wait.
 If I go to the shell and manually use gpg command to decrypt a file, and I enter my passphase in the shell, the passphase is cached for a certain time. When the passphase is cached, I can now decrypt the .gpg file by opening it in dired, and this seems to be the only way that I can successfully decrypt a file automatically. It is not only annoying but stupid.
 Why is Emacs not prompting for anything when it needs my passphase? Am I missing any configurations to make it works?
 I am using Emacs 28.0.5 with native compilation.
 Edit: I am using Arch and Exwm and I use startx to initialize Emacs. I just noticed that, when I quit Emacs, I saw the tty shell was prompting for passphase, I have no way to enter my passphase there when I am in GUI mode, what am I supposed to do?

                    <span>I seem to not be able to stop trying to tweak my lsp configuration regarding which features it uses, and which ones are disabled. Out of the box, it seems very busy. I&#x27;ve found this guide on enabling/disabling features which is quite helpful in understanding what everything is and how to toggle each piece. Nonetheless, i found that I just keep tweaking it; the lsp user interface just seems to always be in my way in some sense, or I end up disabling something I want later. (I&#x27;m using Doom, fyi.)
 I&#x27;m hoping to crowdsource a solution to my continual tweaking. Which combo of lsp features to you find are best for getting helpful info, and otherwise staying out of the way?

 Seems like a possible alternative to using org-mode for todo lists, but I can only find a few mentions of it online.
 I think I like the structure it imposes, because sometimes org-mode&#x27;s many features and flexibility can be distracting. 
 Is it harder to integrate with other parts of Emacs?

                    <span>Is it possible to customize the agenda view that is shown when clicking on a tag? Ideally grouping using org-super-agenda.
 If this is possible is it then possible to have custom views / groupings based on a parent tag? For example if the tag that is clicked on is part of the “people” parent tag, do X otherwise do Y.

 I would like to have GitHub automatically publish something like this: https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#intro (table of contents, folding, on a GitHub.io domain). Is it possible to utilize GitHub CI to automatically 
  
Add all org files in the repository 
 Convert/format it as html (similar to tecosaurs format)
 Publish it

                    <span>I want to create a capture template that writes to the currently open file under a given heading (say Meetings) creating it if necessary. 
 One use case: I work on multiple projects and use an org file for each. I want to use a meeting minutes template that writes to the org file of the project that I have open. 
 I currently use refile but I forget to do so sometimes. I also heard about C-0 but I&#x27;m looking for a better solution. 
 I use Doom emacs if that is relevant. 
 Any help along this line or a different way of dealing with this is appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>Alright, girls, boys, and those who lie in-between. We know there are already libraries written in Scala 3, but how many end-user apps are there? Because I have one for you! 🥳
 ... and it&#x27;s a calculator.
 https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/calculator3
 From here you can download the APK file and install it on your phone with &#x60;adb&#x60; and a USB cable. I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to register this app on F-Droid or, gods have mercy, Google Play Store. In the future, I will do it with a more complex app I have in plans, but for now, &#x60;adb install&#x60; is the way to go). Or you can copy the whole repo and build the app yourselves.
 Here&#x27;s how it looks like:
 Scala 3 Calculator
 This remarkable achievement of razor-edge tech and top-notch UX wouldn&#x27;t be possible without all the brilliant people working on Scala 3, GraalVM, Gluon, JavaFX, and scala-maven-plugin. Me, I&#x27;m just putting the puzzles together.
 That being said, Scala 3 support still needs some love. There are issues, mostly around JVM/Scala compatibility (Java modules *coff* *coff*) . Now I will spend some time describing what I found about them the best I could - and nagging the above-mentioned brilliant people to take a look. But, all in all, I think we&#x27;re really doing great. I didn&#x27;t expect the migration to be so easy. Just as earlier I didn&#x27;t expect all these different pieces would so easily fall into their places and a Scala app on Android would just work. I feel... grateful. And also super happy - hence the tone of this entry.
 Cheers 😊

 Procedural pixel-art campfire
 I&#x27;ve written up a little tutorial on how to make a procedural pixel art fire shader in Indigo (Scala game engine).
 https://indigoengine.io/docs/guides/howto-fire-shader
 If you&#x27;d rather jump straight into the code, there is a GitHub repo that accompanies the how-to guide here:

                    <span>Tutanota works differently to other email providers, and unfortunately I have only been able to get their official desktop client to work. 
 Has anybody here figured out how to get Tutanota to work with Emacs?

                    <span>I&#x27;m really interested in having completion and validation when editing my kubernetes manifest files.
 But can&#x27;t figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on emacs
 I followed the official guide, using npm to install the yaml lsp server and enabling the lsp mode for yaml files.
 FIRST PROBLEM: if I use the combination keys (C-M-i) I used to run company-complete, in yaml mode it runs the ispell-complete-word and I can&#x27;t understand why
 SECOND PROBLEM: when I run lsp-yaml-set-buffer-schema or lsp-yaml-select-buffer-schema and I select a json schema, I get the following error in lsp-resolve-value(set-from-style) function
 (void-variable set-from-style)
 ​
 Did somebody figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on Emacs? You can even apply json schema for some CRD, like the ones managed by Istio?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not sure if I asked it correctly but what I mean is I have a buffer with this text: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (&quot;test&quot; 0 4 (font-lock-face org-level-1))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (which is the output of (propertize &quot;test&quot; &#x27;font-lock-face &#x27;org-level-1) btw)
 and I want to insert processed (faces applied to &quot;test&quot;) version of that text. But my try:
  (insert (with-current-buffer (get-buffer &quot;test&quot;) (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))) 
 inserts the exact same of buffer content.
 I want to insert it as (insert (propertize &quot;test&quot; &#x27;font-lock-face &#x27;org-level-1)) do.
 How can I achieve this?
 Background info: I want to show my daily agenda in the start screen (dashboard) but it takes time, so I&#x27;m trying to do this in emacsclient asynchronously.

                    <span>I tried to set split screen divider-width but it seems it stays that way even when there&#x27;s no split screen, leaving me with a divider that makes no sense.
 (setq default-frame-alist (append (list &#x27;(right-divider-width . 20) &#x27;(bottom-divider-width . 2)))) 
 Is there any way to set divider-width only when there&#x27;s a split screen present, otherwise make it nil?

                    <span>Functions from packages are reported as natively compiled, but my &quot;.el&quot; files are not.
 EmacsWiki: GCC Emacs said:
  
When a byte-compiled Elisp module is loaded, it gets queued for native compilation. Once native compilation has finished, the native-compiled definitions automatically replace the byte-compiled versions.
  
In my config:
 (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation t) (byte-recompile-file file nil 0 &#x27;load) 
 But functions in file are just byte-compiled, even after a looong time. I have seen emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load, but isn&#x27;t it usable for active buffers only?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m using org-mode to write my notes and occasionally I insert a latex code block when org-mode itself isn&#x27;t enough. In those situations I use org-edit-special which pops me into a latex buffer with the contents of the code block, but because auctex doesnt see the usepackage headers that are available on export, it doesn&#x27;t load any of the cool macros or environments I have set up for completion. Does anyone have a workaround for this?
 Edit:
 Here&#x27;s something that works for now:
 elisp (add-hook &#x27;org-src-mode-hook (defun org-src-setup-auctex () (when (eq major-mode &#x27;latex-mode) (apply #&#x27;TeX-run-style-hooks (mapcar #&#x27;cadr org-latex-packages-alist)))))

                    <span>Problem
 If I have a list and I hit return, I want it to add a new item to the list (instead of adding notes to said item). M-return has the functionality I want, but I want it to be mapped to return.
 Basically, I want to swap M-return and return in org-mode.

 I have tried a handful of things, which have all failed.

The end result is that my table became too wide for me. Is there a way to (manually) split the second column over 2 lines? For instance my position is on the middle of the second column. Then I use some function and the rest of the column goes to a new inserted line. Thanks in advance for your help.

                    <span>Is there a way to define a &quot;super type&quot; in Scala? It seems like types can not implement traits. What I want to do is something like this example, where I basically I have this trait:
 type ScrollBar &#x3D; ... type Window &#x3D; ... trait Widget[A] { def CreateScrollBar[B]() : ScrollBar def CreateWindow[B]() : Window } 
 And some type that implement it using ad hoc polymorphism:
 implicit val pmWidget : Widget[PMWidget] &#x3D; new Widget[PMWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[PMScrollBar](): ScrollBar &#x3D; ... def CreateWindow[PMWindow](): Window &#x3D; ... } 
 But I want both ScrollBar and Window to be of a specific type, referent to my PMWidget:
 type MotifScrollBar &#x3D; ... type MotifWindow &#x3D; ... type MotifWidget &#x3D; (MotifScrollBar, MotifWindow) 
 Is there a way to do this using type declarations? I thought about something like:
 type ScrollBar[A] &#x3D; A type Window[A] &#x3D; A 
 But if I implement it like this (using ints just to simplify):
 type MotifScrollBar &#x3D; Int type MotifWindow &#x3D; Int implicit val pmWidget : Widget[MotifWidget] &#x3D; new Widget[MotifWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[MotifScrollBar](): ScrollBar[MotifScrollBar] &#x3D; 0 // type mismatch here def CreateWindow[MotifWindow](): Window[MotifWindow] &#x3D; 0 // type mismatch here } 
 I&#x27;m getting type mismatches where I indicated. Is there some workaround?

                    <span>Hi Zettelkasten friends,
I&#x27;ve been processing papers on psychology lately (on retrieval practice and reading comprehension) but I&#x27;m having trouble implementing the concept of &quot;layers of evidence&quot; as described in https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/.
In the post, @sfast said: (my emphasis for context)

  
The next layer of evidence is the interpretation of data patterns. The phenomenological layer meant you describe what you saw. Here, you interpret why you saw it.
Now the concept of causality can come into play. You can explain the correlation above by saying: Drowning people in swimming pools generates amplifiers for the nuclear power plants in the U.S, and that’s why when more people drown in swimming pools, more energy is generated in nuclear power plants.

                    <span>Hi there, finally I stole some time to:
  
publish my moldable-emacs code (very early release actually, just for the brave users)
 sort my ideas about the vision of the mode
 show how to explore JSON with it
  
Maybe this will be interesting to you too!
 (By the way, I shared earlier how to use this to list all code duplication in a source code buffer.)

                    <span>Hello!
 As in the title; I have forked general.el to add a few autoloaded keywords of my own, by using the :general keyword use-package functions as a template. However, this bit of code, originally used for :general, is not working (read &quot;not being autoloaded&quot;):
 emacs-lisp (defun use-package-handler/:gone (name _keyword args rest state) &quot;Use-package handler for :gone.&quot; (use-package-concat (use-package-process-keywords name rest state) &#x60;(,@(mapcar (lambda (arglist) ;; Note: prefix commands are not valid functions (if (or (functionp (car arglist)) (macrop (car arglist))) &#x60;(,@arglist :package &#x27;,name) &#x60;(general-def (:keymaps &#x27;(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)) ,@arglist :package &#x27;,name))) (plist-get args :arglists))))) 
 The part I have changed is the general-def bit, by adding (:keymaps &#x27;(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)). When demanding the package, it works fine. Am I missing anything here? I&#x27;ve also copied the use-package-autoloads/:general and use-package-handler/:general functions as well, which are exactly the same, and renaming them appropriately.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                    <span>I have an issue where my .dir-locals are getting bigger and bigger, namely due to my current projects using prettier in quite a few different major modes. But also due to specific eglot setups. Enabling prettier and eglot for the relevant major-mode would work in these projects, but would start becoming annoying in the others.
 In trying to move most of the logic to my Emacs configuration and have less duplicates in each of my project roots, I tried the following:
 ;; path/to/my/project/.dir-locals.el ((nil . ((me/eglot-p . t) (me/prettier-p . t)))) ;; dotemacs.el (use-package prettier :preface (defvar-local me/prettier-p nil &quot;Should prettier be enabled?&quot;) :hook (web-mode . me/prettier-mode-maybe) :config (put &#x27;me/prettier-p &#x27;safe-local-variable #&#x27;booleanp)) (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () &quot;Enable &#x60;prettier-mode&#x27; when the prettier executable is found locally.&quot; (when me/prettier-p (prettier-mode))) 
 The issue with that is that dir-local variables are taken into account after web-mode-hook has kicked in, even with nil when no major-mode is specified. So me/prettier-p is always nil in me/prettier-mode-maybe.
 A second attempt, ignoring dir-local variables altogether, looked like this:

 Which is obviously too slow to be acceptable.
 What are your preferred methods to avoid having to copy the same .dir-locals.el every time you start a similar project or even reinstall your machine(s)? That was actually my case btw: I realized while reinstalling my machine how much stuff I had to copy around after cloning all my repositories.

 I have three problems that I cannot fix, if possible, can you help?
  
Close Emacs win LWin+Q
 What I tried:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;s-q&quot;) &#x27;kill-emacs)
 Open shell with &#x60; (tilde key below esc) and if already open, close with &#x60; (tilde key below esc)
 What I tried:
 (global-set-key [f1] &#x27;shell)

 When I create multiple windows (ctrl+x 3, ctrl+x 2) I find it difficult to navigate to the third, fourth or fifth window. Is there a solution?
 Thank you! :)

 I&#x27;ve setup mu4e on another machine, but I would like to use it on the gnus machine. Is there any way I can do this without having to setup offlineimap again? I don&#x27;t think that gnus actually stores emails locally so perhaps that&#x27;s not possible...

                    <span>I run into a problem of ediff-files hanging. How to figure out the root cause? 
 When I performed ediff between two files, after providing file B, the emacs hanged, without displaying the ediff buffers, but the status area shows &quot;processing difference regions ... done&quot;. 
 The emacs process has to be aborted through task manager. C-g would not work, neither SPC q 
 The emacs version is Emacs 27.1. 
 The emacs-config of tecosaur (https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-config) is used with the recent Doom. 
 Here is a screenshot showing where it hanged and the high CPU utilization of the emacs process. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2638417/122454243-05707c00-cf60-11eb-8bb7-93c39339811d.png) 
 I tried ediff-buffers has the same problem.(edited)
 I really like emacs-config that I want to make it work. Thanks in advance for helps!

                    <span>In my Org QL project, I maintain a notes file to track ideas, bugs, etc, similar to the way GitHub issues and milestones can be used. After modifying entries for a while–including setting priorities, to-do/done status, etc–the outline tends to get a bit jumbled. Org has the built-in org-sort command, but it must be run manually, and it only supports one sorting method at a time. It quickly becomes tedious, and it&#x27;s impractical to use regularly.
 But with a bit of code and an after-save-hook, this can be automated so that, every time I save the file, all of its entries are re-sorted according to my criteria (alphabetical, priority, and to-do status), and then the point is repositioned to where it was before the file was sorted (the last feature being one I just added, which makes it much mo…</span>

It remains black (the background color of my theme), and the error: &quot;error in process filter: invalid face: unspecified&quot; appears to be the problem. Not only cannot I not access cmus, I can&#x27;t access anything.
 However, I have no idea what caused this, where to fix it, and how to fix it. Can anyone help? I&#x27;ve looked around, but can&#x27;t find a good answer.
 Also, when I run emacs -Q, the terminal DOES seem to work fine.

                    <span>Have you ever had a technical question about GHC you didn&#x27;t get a good answer for?
 Tomorrow, Saturday June 19, 17:00 Zurich time, there will be a GHC ask-me-anything panel discussion.
 It will be live-streamed on YouTube on the ZuriHac channel.
 We will have Simon Peyton-Jones and Ben Gamari on the panel as GHC developers, and we need you to ask them questions!
 You can ask your questions:
  
Live via the ZuriHac Discord, channel #ghc-panel-discussion
 Live via the libera.chat IRC channel #ghc; prefix your question with nh2: ZuriHac GHC AMA question:
 Here any time (I will collect the questons until 1 hour before the event)
  
The questions will read to the panelists during the event.
 We&#x27;d like to get technical questions about GHC, e.g. “how does class instance lookup work?”, not so much personal questions like “how long have you worked on GHC?”.
  
ZuriHac is the world&#x27;s largest Haskell Hackathon. It is free to join, and this year it is remote, so you can join simply by registering on https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2021/ Registering will send you the Discord invite, in case you want to ask your questions there.

                    <span>What is Hideout?
  
Hideout is a self-hosted service that makes private, persistent chat rooms possible. It requires no installation or account creation. Unlike disposable chat, a Hideout room preserves privacy without expiring.
 The GitHub repo contains a detailed introduction, and guides for hosting, building, and contributing: https://github.com/techmindful/hideout
 A video demo can be watched here: https://vimeo.com/564494164.
 A demo instance is running at hideout-demo.com. Uptime is expected to be unstable. Do not trust it for your own private conversations.
 Language stack is Haskell/Elm. Haskell, Elm, and the privacy community need more killer apps! Hideout tries to be as pretty and feature-rich as possible, so that when people opt for privacy, they won&#x27;t be getting a lackluster alternative.

A data declaration introduces one or more type constructors and one or more value constructors for each type constructor.
  
Out of curiosity, in what syntax can &quot;more&quot; type constructors be defined in &quot;a&quot; data declaration?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 Chordify is hiring again! This post might look familiar to you if you&#x27;ve been around here for a while. That&#x27;s because I posted about a vacancy we had back in October. Since then, we&#x27;ve hired two new developers, but we&#x27;re still expanding!
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

                    <span>Hello reddit!
 I rely heavily on org-capture / org-roam-capture to sort my notes.
 Problem
 Until recently I had a working setup for my capture templates, but at the moment everytime I want to capture a file I get prompted to specify a path to save the capture in – which the template already should have done.
 It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I specify a full path or not – but I dont&#x27;t see the error in my config (except org-capture works without my config quite well)
 Config
 (setq org-directory &quot;~/org/&quot; org-roam-directory &quot;~/org/&quot;) (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;( (&quot;t&quot; &quot;Aufgabe&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/gtd/inbox.org&quot; &quot;Tasks to sort&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?\n %i\n %a&quot;) (&quot;n&quot; &quot;Notiz&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/gtd/inbox.org&quot; &quot;Notes to sort&quot;) &quot;* %?\n %i\n %a&quot;) ;; templates for the org-capture extension in Fi…</span>

                    <span>In my Org QL project, I maintain a notes file to track ideas, bugs, etc, similar to the way GitHub issues and milestones can be used. After modifying entries for a while–including setting priorities, to-do/done status, etc–the outline tends to get a bit jumbled. Org has the built-in org-sort command, but it must be run manually, and it only supports one sorting method at a time. It quickly becomes tedious, and it&#x27;s impractical to use regularly.
 But with a bit of code and an after-save-hook, this can be automated so that, every time I save the file, all of its entries are re-sorted according to my criteria (alphabetical, priority, and to-do status), and then the point is repositioned to where it was before the file was sorted (the last feature being one I just added, which makes it much mo…</span>

                    <span>I have to use a js lib that wants me to reject a promise with a json object:
 { requeue: true } 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to use Variant approach (inspired by https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-chirashi)
 type MyError &#x3D; Variant (ErrorRow ()) type ErrorRow r &#x3D; ( requeue :: Boolean | r ) case foo of Right h -&gt; h Left _ -&gt; Aff.throwError $ mkVariantError (inj (Proxy :: Proxy &quot;requeue&quot;) true) 
 But all I could get was:
 {&quot;variant&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;requeue&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true},&quot;message&quot;:&quot;VariantError&quot;} 
 Is there an easy way to do this? Thanks for any tips.

 I&#x27;m essentially creating a rich text editor and I have the following HTML structure:
 
 foo
 This is a new row
 baz
  
 I have a subscription to an event listener for each p tag to track text input and record it into my Halogen component&#x27;s state. I render the editor div from the Halogen component state.
 I also use the onKeyDown event to refocus the caret for navigation up and down between p tags and for inserting new p tags …</span>

 Code looks like this. This mapping looks quite clear to me and I cant understand why is there type misamatching.

                    <span>Hi All, I am reading a book that talks about parallel programming and starts implementing a method for adding list of elements. He say&#x27;s we need a container to store the result i.e, myresult[ aggSum ] . My question is Why do we need to store the result ( aggSum ) inside myResult ( container ), when we can represent the sum of elements using aggSum. If he says Optional[aggSum] / Either[aggSum] I would understand but he wants to store it in a container. So what exactly is a container ?, why is it&#x27;s purpose ?, does it has to do anything with generics.

This uses two short and straightforward Keyboard Maestro macros. One to place the file in the /media directory and then forms the link, placing it in the clipboard for pasting, and the second calls the file and opens it in its default application. This all works beautifully with my Two Window Workflow keeping the target note in focus while reviewing the attachment alongside in a separate window. Simple is as simple does!

                    <span>Greetings, emacsians. I&#x27;m trying to set up org mode for personal task management and have come across the issue that apparently org mode list items can&#x27;t be todo items (only checkmarked items) and that only headings can actually be org mode todos. This is quite a disappointment as I enjoy the automatic numbering and nicely formatted nestability available for lists and also the agenda views of todo items, and I would very much like to use them together.
 Are there any packages which fix this dilemma? Or any elisp way to do this? Or are miracles real and is there a way to actually do this in normal org mode? Any of these would be much appreciated!
 Thanks!

                    <span>i have work on windows, and i prepare to use emacs from remote ubuntu machine over ssh.
 for some reason when ever i write the file path /ssh:name@ip:path, emacs hangs! i always ssh from emacs into another linux machine, i wonder why it hangs?! is there a better way?
 i do normally access the machine from the terminal, but /ssh:some_name@192.168.5.40:d:\note do take forever!

                    <span>Hello emacsians! I am an emacs noob customizing my config for the first time. Every emacs tutorial seems to call for installing either Ivy or Helm, however few are able to describe why they are necessary without referring to use cases and jargon that I either can&#x27;t relate to or don&#x27;t understand (my use cases for now involve task management, calendar management, and writing with only a small secondary emphasis on coding).
 I&#x27;ve opted not to go with Helm for now based on some complaints about performance, but the question remains of whether or not to install Ivy. So, for those of you who have experienced both vanilla emacs and Ivy emacs, what are the features (if any) that Ivy provides that you just can&#x27;t live without? Also, what are the worst things about Ivy?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know whether it is the suitable place to ask.
 I am using notmuch in Emacs, whenever I sent an email and sync the mailbox, my sent email shown as an unread email in my notmuch emacs client. This is very annoying.
 I am hosting my own Email server using dovecot and postfix. I am not sure whether this is a server side issue or client side issue. I knew it may not be caused by notmuch or Emacs, but I had no issue when using mu4e.
 Is this normal? What can I do to fix?

                    <span>Hi,
 I was wondering what options do we have in org-mode to save metadata on web links.
 I have counted 6500 https?:// links in all my notes and I would like to categorize at least some of them, in time.
 I don&#x27;t want to use titles for them, but I know that only titles have properties, or drawers.
 Right now my pseudo random convention is:
 
 This is a list of useful links:
 Wow, this article is so nice:
 https://example.com/whatever
 &gt; summary line 1
 &gt; summary line 2
 Written by the same author as the previous:
 https://foo.bar.com/stuff
 &gt; summary line
 &gt; summary line 2
 
 I would like to add metadata such as:
  
some tags, or categories for the links (eg: technical, art, spiritual)
 if it&#x27;s a git repo mention the programming language
 if it&#x27;s an article mention the author&#x27;s name
 if I save it offline, take a note about that
 different fields that I don&#x27;t know yet
  
Does anyone use anything like that? Maybe there&#x27;s a library that does something similar?
 Thank you
 edit: fix formatting

                    <span>I&#x27;m an IDE user (JetBrains currently, Visual Studio when I used to write C#) with basic Vim knowledge, using primarily Java and JS with some TS. I&#x27;m getting tired of the less-than-useful vim support in the IDE space, as well as general inflexibility in setting up workflows. I&#x27;ve been looking into emacs (spacemacs) as a daily-driver, and I like almost everything about it. However, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with a certain part of my workflow that relies on refactoring support.
 This applies less to new features, and more to maintenance work on legacy(ish) code, which is honestly a lot of what I do. I&#x27;ve come to heavily rely on Kent Beck&#x27;s &quot;make the hard change easy&quot; advice, combined with Arlo Belshee&#x27;s read by refactoring. I like that I can use chains of known-safe IDE refactorings to rapidly explore and change the structure of a body of code before I even understand what it&#x27;s doing, and know that I&#x27;m not changing the semantics in the process.
 Seems like a decent portion of my go-to tools are supported in JS with js2-refactor, but not all. (Haven&#x27;t looked at whether it works with TS yet, and Tide may also be able to fill some holes even when applied to plain-JS.) On the other hand meghanada has been a bit disappointing in the refactoring department. Rust, if I ever work with that, looks to have an absolutely phenomenal language server.
 In addition to my two primaries, I&#x27;d like to be confident in branching out into, say, Go, Kotlin, or Swift, and I see about as much refactoring support for each of those as what meghanada has for Java; that is, nearly nothing.
 What do experienced emacs-ians do for these tasks? Do former IDE users among you not miss automated refactorings? Do you have emacs-native workflows that reliably work for, say, &quot;extract/inline variable/function/parameter&quot;?

                    <span>Hello, I am beginner learning Haskell and Cabal toolchain/workflow. Currently, I am compiling simple Haskell code with C-wrapper into foreign native shared library on Linux. To make the toolchain commands and package loading/(future) dependencies easier to manage, I am doing it with Cabal. I found a reference in this site (among others):
 http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/so.xhtml
 At first, I missed key point:
 &quot;The Haskell code is to be listed under other-modules.&quot;
 I did not set the other-modules field and my build wasnt working. Now it works. But I wanted to ask why the name of the field was chosen as to other-modules, since it actually makes the connection between Haskell code and the C code wrapper? Without having the clue that &quot;it doesnt work without it,&quot; I would never try to search for something like that ...
 Let me know if this is not the correct place to ask this question and where would a better place for that be.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a lib that would allow me to build up a markdown doc using some DSL out of primitives (Blocks, Inlines, etc) and then simply convert it to a &#x60;Text&#x60; representation (i.e. render into text).
 This seems like such an easy thing to do, I&#x27;ve googled for potential solutions to this however and I&#x27;m having a real hard time figuring out how to do this with current libs available on hackage.
 I&#x27;ve looked at &#x60;cmark&#x60; &#x60;mmark&#x60;, even &#x60;pandoc&#x60; to no avail. It seems to me that libs like &#x60;mmark&#x60; are designed to only parse markdown documents, ensure conformity to standards, and render to html.
 I thought &#x60;pandoc&#x60; would be my saving grace (which I reluctantly tried to use since it&#x27;s such a large dependency), their &#x60;Block&#x60; DSL seems fine, but even &#x60;pandoc&#x60; does not have something like &#x60;render :: Pandoc -&gt; Text&#x60;. It does have &#x60;writeMarkdown :: PandocMonad m &#x3D;&gt; WriterOptions -&gt; Pandoc -&gt; m Text&#x60; but i really want to have a pure rendering function without all this &#x60;PandocMonad&#x60; complication (which seems superfluous if I want to render into a simple &#x60;Text&#x60; doc).
 (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-2.14.0.2/docs/Text-Pandoc-Writers-Markdown.html) 
 Anyone has a suggestion?

                    <span>I have a Haskell project that I&#x27;ve been working on over the last few years.
 One thing I absolutely love about Haskell is that its so easy to refactor with confidence, for example renaming and changing types, and the compiler flags any issues early on.
 What I would like to do now is to consolidate the names of parameters. So for example, I started with a function for working with indices and counts of elements.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 indicesRemaining :: Cnt -&gt; Idx -&gt; [Idx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx &#x3D; 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and say I&#x27;ve renamed the types to be clearer, using a global find-replace:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -&gt; BlockIdx -&gt; [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining cnt idx &#x3D; 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 this is great, but I&#x27;d like to also update cnt and idx, to be blkCnt and blkIdx, for example. I can do in manually, but I&#x27;ve done a load of refactorings, so have a load of these.
 What I am looking for is a tool that can run over my code-base, and spurt out a list of types, and all the different variables names used by that type. So, if I have the following code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; indicesRemaining :: BlockCnt -&gt; BlockIdx -&gt; [BlockIdx]
 indicesRemaining blkCnt blkIdx &#x3D; 
 indexWithinCnt :: BlockCnt -&gt; BlockIdx -&gt; Bool
 indexWithinCnt cntMax idx &#x3D; 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Then, I am looking for something like the following output:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; BlockCnt : blkCnt, cntMax
 BlockIdx : blkIdx, idx
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And I can then go through and manually review cases where lots of different names exist for the same thing.
 Is anyone aware whether something like this already exists? If not, I was wondering if HIE would be a good tools to build something like this on top of??
 Best wishes, and thanks in advance.
 Mike

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been playing around with the ComonadCofree typeclass from free and I stumbled across this cute little function:
 explore :: (ComonadCofree f w, MonadFree f m) &#x3D;&gt; (w a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b) -&gt; w a -&gt; m b explore f &#x3D; wrap . fmap (\w -&gt; f w (explore f w)) . unwrap 
 I&#x27;ve been calling it explore because it behaves as a kind of fold over a cofree comonad into a free monad: the first argument to f is the part of the comonadic &quot;environment&quot; that&#x27;s getting &quot;explored&quot; in this step, and the second argument is the future monadic &quot;exploration&quot; that covers the &quot;rest of the environment&quot;.
 Is this a thing? I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything on Hackage with exactly this functionality, but I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t quite have the categorical vocabulary to easily tell if it&#x27;s a special case of a definition in adju…</span>

 Hoping you can help. I use a bunch of files as part of org - specifically dailies and unique files that are from org-roams concepts. I add todo items to all (but mostly the dailies). I&#x27;m finding that some of my files are not being added to org-agenda automatically even though I&#x27;m using the config below. Am I doing something wrong here?
  (setq org-agenda-files (apply &#x27;append (mapcar (lambda (directory) (directory-files-recursively directory org-agenda-file-regexp)) &#x27;(&quot;/Users/ochaa/Code/org/&quot;))))

                    <span>To ensure I don&#x27;t get flogged with a wet squirrel...I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs btw.
 I&#x27;m getting this &quot;simple date&quot; from (org-read-date), which I would&#x27;ve thought would give various formats. Basically, I&#x27;d like to have a date as exemplified in the title, and be able to determine which day of the week it falls on (i.e. Thursday, Friday, whatever).

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m mostly a Java guy, but with the new functional bits in Java I found Scala people many times have already developed good practices for things we are still struggling with, so I&#x27;m asking here.
 Recently there is a trend in my workplace to replace null-friendly values with Optional, so (simplified case, you get the idea)
 NamedObject obj &#x3D; ..... if(obj &#x3D;&#x3D; null){ return &quot;no object, so no name&quot; } else { return obj.name(); } 
 becomes
 Optiona opt &#x3D; .... return opt.map(NamedObject::name).orElse(&quot;no object, so no name&quot;) 
 I like that, but I don&#x27;t know how to handle logging. When I have
 NamedObject obj &#x3D; ..... if(obj &#x3D;&#x3D; null){ logger.warn(&quot;there was no object&quot;) return &quot;no object, so no name&quot; } else { logger.debug(&quot;using actual name of the object&quot;) return obj.name(); } 
 What would be the proper way to keep the logging functionality in a more functional way?

                    <span>I am trying to use SQL JDBC Driver in my project . I ran a spark job locally and I can see that the code is working fine.
 When I try to make a fat JAR of the code (using SBT-Assembly) and run it , I get an error saying that some method in SQL JDBC Driver module is not found (methodNotFound Exception).
 I checked the JAR file and as far as I can see the class file that provides the method in question is present in the JAR. 
 I have been breaking my head over this. Please help

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to configure notmuch for using with emacs.
 Is it possible to tell notmuch/emacs to take into account the Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding to translate the raw email content and show characters with accents instead. For example &quot;Programação&quot; instead of &quot;ProgramaÃ§Ã£o&quot; ?

                    <span>A bit off-topic but someone might know; I&#x27;m working with jupyter notebook files (ipynb) which are basically json files. Git diff is very noisy so there&#x27;s nbdime which works great in the CLI. Is there a way to have Magit aware of its integration with git diff?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a windows PC for my work now, instead of linux. This means that ensure-system-package doesn&#x27;t work. This code snippet conditionally allows it for non-windows systems, but will stub it for windows so we don&#x27;t get errors about unrecognized setups.
  (if (not (equal window-system &#x27;w32)) (use-package use-package-ensure-system-package) (progn (add-to-list &#x27;use-package-keywords :ensure-system-package) (defun use-package-normalize/:ensure-system-package (name-symbol keywords args)) (defun use-package-handler/:ensure-system-package (name-symbol keyword archive-name rest state))))

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to use languagetool with Emacs to correct both grammar and syntax while I write in French and English. 
 I&#x27;ve tried this package but for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t work, it just exits with an error code, whatever the language. 
 Did someone manage to have this working with multiple languages by any chance ? 
 Thanks

                    <span>Is there any way to do this? I&#x27;d like all my org mode files to be part of an &quot;org project&quot;, regardless of their locations. I use projectile, ibuffer, ibuffer-projectile, and (obviously) org-mode.
 At the moment I&#x27;ve got:
 (setq org-directory &quot;~/.emacs.d/config/org/&quot;) (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups (quote [...] (&quot;orgproject&quot; (or (name . &quot;^\\*Org Agenda\\*$&quot;) (mode . org-mode))) 
 which I thought would do it, but it doesn&#x27;t. I expected all buffers with org-mode active would be listed within an &quot;orgproject&quot; group in ibuffer, and files that are in the org-directory are in that group, but files that are in other directories, even though they&#x27;re open and in org-agenda-files, just go into a general group in ibuffer.

                    <span>maybe the question is wired. Is there a text base web browser that can let me browse youtube but with the text only(not youtube specific, but the web page with tone of javaish thing?)? Because I’m just install gnu guix with exwm yesterday. have no idea what browser I can use. eww just give me a search bar and the rest is just blank.

                    <span>I am trying to use shakle to tame the pop ups that I have (in combination with popper). One case I have is AUCTeX which displays a list of errors if the document fails to compile. Clicking on an error brings up a new window which shows details of the error.
 I wanted to set it so that the list of errors appear at the bottom and then the error description appears at the right of the error list. I tried the following
  (setq shackle-rules &#x27;((&quot;*TeX errors*&quot; :select t :align below :size 0.2) (&quot;*TeX Help*&quot; :select t :align right :size 0.5))) 
 Now, if I have a window displaying the latex file, the list of errors appears at the bottom as expected, but then clicking on an error adds a vertical window spanning the whole interface (both the latex buffer and the error list buffer) instead of splitting the window which displays &quot;TeX errors&quot;. 
 Is there a way to get my desired window splitting?

                    <span>Hey, I want to configure the ivy-rich-display-transformers-list variable from the ivy-rich package. More precisely, I just want to remove the (ivy-rich-switch-buffer-project (:width 0.18 :face success)) part of it, that shows to which project a buffer belongs when switching buffers. Redefining the entire variable without this bit clutters my config a lot since this variable has a lot of content. Is there a few to just remove that bit from the original value of the variable? I tried to do it using my limited elisp, but I couldn&#x27;t do it even in a semi-elegant way. Any tips there? Cheers!

 I tried setting it in many sized, but all of them turns out like this
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package doom-modeline

 :custom ((doom-modeline-height 25))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And i have all-the-icons installed, and did run all-the-icons-install-fonts as well. Any solutions?

                    <span>I learned about M-x auto-insert from this blog post: Lesser known functionalities in core Emacs, and it made me wonder if something similar exists for inserting the file local variable comments at the end of a file?
 I can never remember the syntax, and I don&#x27;t use it often enough to learn it, so it would be most helpful if I could go M-x insert-file-local-variable or something.
 Ok, so this is where Emacs is great:
 After I remembered that it is called &quot;file local variables&quot; I did M-x apropos file-local and found... add-file-local-variable which does exact what I wanted.
 So the answer is: Yes!

                    <span>I am writing an Emacs Lisp package&#x27;s documentation with Org mode. Currently, I am manually exporting the document to the Texinfo format, but I sometimes forget to do this.
 Is there a way to automate this, beyond just using after-save-hook? 
  
Could this be done by Emacs when installing the package?
 Could this be done by Github after I push to the repo?
 Are there existing packages that have automated this step?
  
Thank you.

                    <span>As in here. I couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to do it with Data.TASequence.ConsList. I want to maintain type-aligned-ness in my data structure, but since type information only includes the types of the beginning and the end, I suspect it might be hard to write a function with the right type signature like so:
 split :: ConsList a z -&gt; ConsList a b -&gt; ConsList b z
 or even just:
 tail :: ConsList a z -&gt; ConsList b z
 Alternatively, is this possible using free monads?

                    <span>I am new to both but the documentation for Elm seems to complement what I am learning in the Haskell book Programming from First Principles. 
 Are functional programs similar to each other in the way that imperative languages are to each other?
 My guess is yes but I&#x27;d like to hear detailed explanations from functional veterans.

                    <span>There is a function available that sets the scrollTop property of a DOM Element.
 But the collection of properties provided by Halogen do not seem to include this. How would I set the scrollTop of an element in the render function?

                    <span>I have just finished the first article or a substantial post if you like , where Zettelkasten did help me to gather ideas, combine them and produce something valuable (on how to choose the statistical significance level for your AB-tests and what effect does the choice have).
I happily published it and.. what do you, guys, usually do with the articles of yours then?
The final article definitely does contain some valuable knowledge (valuable to me certainly). If I have found something like this on the internets, I would probably compose several zettles out of it and saved to the local storage for references (I tend to not just link to the web, but also store referred things locally so they don&#x27;t disappear).
But in this particular case, zettels the article was based on do exist already, there&#x27;s nothing new to extract. What do you usually do with the work of yours?
- Do you still add it to your Zettelkasten as a giant Zettel?
- Or do you store it and make a dummy zettel just so that you have a link to this reference in ZK?
- Or do you review your existing zettels that contributed to the article and add a reference to the final target?
- Or do you do nothing as all the knowledge from this article is in your ZK already and that&#x27;s good enough?
- Or something else?</span>

                    <span>So here&#x27;s the setup. I&#x27;ve got two projects. 
 f:\project-base
 f:\project-base\specific-case
 I cannot change the layout of these projects; they&#x27;re not under my control.
 It&#x27;s legitimate to want to compile project-base on its own. However, most of the time I want to compile specific-case.
 Both project-base and specific-case have .dir-locals.el files, and I&#x27;m using the files to define relative paths to tools and the like. I&#x27;ve defined an override variable that I can set within a hydra called project--path-override. However, if I invoke my hydra while visiting a buffer that&#x27;s in project-base, it uses the .dir-locals.el from that directory. That&#x27;s kind of as I expect, but if my override is set, I&#x27;d like to figure out a way to use the locals from the override directory.
 Even if I invoke the hydra and set the default-directory to the project--path-override and call (hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer), the local variables from project-base are still set.
 I don&#x27;t really want to have to defvar all of these configuration variables somewhere and update them every time I switch project directories; being free of that management is exactly why I&#x27;m using .dir-locals.el in the first place. 
 I also thought that I might be able to create a fake buffer as part of invoking the hydra, but that seems like a needless mess of its own. 
 Anyone have a more manageable solution? I can always switch back to a file in specific-case, but I often forget to do that and launch a compile in the wrong directory first. Plus, I&#x27;m doing most of my work in project-base, so I end up having to visit random files that I actually don&#x27;t care about in specific-case just to get the vars to be set right. (I could also modify the .dir-locals.el in project-base to match the one in specific-case, but this falls apart if I ever try to do anything in specific-case2.)

                    <span>Figured I&#x27;d ask here before wasting a bunch of time trying to figure this one out on my own, since Googling and C-h i haven&#x27;t turned up easy solutions yet.
 When I write docstrings in my Lisp code, I like the source to be auto-filled so that line breaks appear in sensible places, but I don&#x27;t like those auto-filled newlines to appear in the runtime versions of those docstrings (since the line width may vary between my editor and whatever is printing the docstring). To that effect, I&#x27;ve been using auto-fill-mode to insert newlines as appropriate, and then manually putting backslash characters at the end of each broken lines. This is undesirable for a few reasons, including that it means auto-fill makes some lines longer than will fit once I&#x27;ve added a space and a backslash.
 Is there any way to get fill-paragraph to insert these backslashes for me?

 I tried to employ tramp on Emacs of windows through putty.(Emacs 27.2 on windows)

 I set tramp method as:

 ​
 What&#x27;s wrong with my usage of plink against tramp?

                    <span>one day, i configured two variables instead of one. &quot;it&#x27;s just one variable&quot;, i said to myself. another day i wrote a function. &quot;what gives, everybody does one or two when they&#x27;re young&quot; i said. then i wrote my first minor mode. i thought, what&#x27;s life without risks? #yolo, after all. then, before i know, i was writing elisp packages, compiling Emacs from git every week. i even tried EXWM at one point, and that was when i grasped the grim reality: i was addicted, consumed, never to be fully restored. i needed help nobody can give, care nobody can take. i had fallen into an abyss, and it is now but a matter of time before i hit the ground.
 mothers, fathers, elder siblings. listen to your little fellows when they come to you, and say &quot;my friends are trying something&quot;, or if they say &quot;when i grow up, i want to customise my text editor&quot;. i beg you, deliver them from this.. this... evil. or else, you may have to watch them edit-last-kbd-macro, with your hands tied, and heart broken. i was young, alone, and misguided, but you&#x27;re adults and you can understand. listen to this lost soul!

                    <span>There are very few things I like about working in LibreOffice, but one of them is the ability to select a sentence with a triple mouse click, or a paragraph with a quadruple click. I guess this is similar to using &quot;expand-selection&quot;, but I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to mimic the LibreOffice behaviour. Any ideas?

                    <span>I would like to compile gruvbox theme to single elisp file without any external dependency, such as auto-themer. So I can configure it once and load it like this, before any other code in my init.el file. I try to speed up load time. I already found very old version of this theme in repo history, but it doesn&#x27;t have all necessary color changes, as latest one have.

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m using mbsync and mu4e with a very large IMAP tree. It takes ages to update. On the other hand, thunderbird very quickly updates the inboxes. I suspect that thunderbird has more frequent checks (polling the IMAP server for new messages) for inboxes compared to other folders. Is something similar possible in mysync ? Right now, the delay between reception on the server and mu4e updating is just too long. 
 Cheers

                    <span>Hi all !
 I&#x27;m looking for a solution to switch between tabs (tab-bar) using ivy counsel. Like bookmarks can visibly be integrated into the list of possible completion in counsel-switch-buffer and was wondering if we could add also a list of tabs for switching to them ? Anybody tried to do something similar ?

                    <span>Hi all,
 A super noob question but I&#x27;ve been digging into theming (as one does) and wanted to know how to tell if a theme is a &quot;color theme&quot; or a &quot;custom theme&quot;? I&#x27;m inclined to go with the &quot;color theme&quot; variant as it seems to be super easy to reset to the original state. Also I am only wanting color changes and not interface changes (yet).
 As an example monokai for emacs.
 Thanks!

 Now he seems to be back but I couldn&#x27;t find any announcements or similar. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, though! I&#x27;m extremely happy that he&#x27;s back and helm is maintained but I&#x27;m curious what changed and if I just missed some announcement 🙂

                    <span>Hi, When I type and latex formula and toggle org-latex-preview, the rest of the line got the different background. The reverse happens when I just type a symbol like \pi and toggle org-toggle-pretty entities, symbol got a different background. 
 Here is a demo: https://ibb.co/BzNbmmf
 How to make everything same color?
 Thank you!

                    <span>Hi all, I have a new notation for rendering function application and composition at the type level. It may make some Haskell concepts clearer and may be useful for expressing other things such as complicated logical combinators
 The change is simple, just write the function result type on a 3-D plate and have the function argument type orbit it--hence the term orbit diagram. It&#x27;s rendered in orthographic perspective. Something about the extra dimension and the clear difference between domain and codomain make it easier to see what&#x27;s going on when function types get complicated. In particular it helped me grasp the Yoneda lemma and continuation-passing style better
 More info in the readme and some examples can be found in the following repo:

                    <span>I want to get better at the language, and the way to achieve that (that makes the most sense to me) is to apply for a job to be trained. So I&#x27;ve been job hunting for Haskell positions. 
 Naturally, I got rejected from most of the applications. I&#x27;m expecting to get rejected in all, tbh. Getting rejected doesn&#x27;t bother me though since I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell anyway. This is pretty much the only expected outcome.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m more concerned with how I can get my first step through an internship. It (internship) appears to be non-existent in the Haskell industry, which it makes it difficult to get some really good hands-on training with the proper learning environment. So with that, it seems like internship is pretty much impossible. I noticed a common expectation among the rejection messages that I&#x27;m expected to have more experience with the language. But getting this experience is rather difficult, and I don&#x27;t really see a clear path to obtain a decent enough experience with it.
 I&#x27;m wondering: 
  
Do personal projects hold any weight in the deliberation process?
 Is contributing to Haskell OSS the only/better way for people to validate that I know something?
 Do I just work for free?
 How do I know what I&#x27;m doing isn&#x27;t a bad approach without anyone there to program with or to act as a mentor? I&#x27;m pretty much alone in self-learning. I tried streaming but it&#x27;s sometimes very distracting, and really daunting.
  
This post isn&#x27;t meant to gather pity from others, please don&#x27;t pity me! I just want to know what I should focus on doing exactly to get a much better chance next time, since this entire thing feels like a chicken and egg situation. If you&#x27;re a business owner, or an employee in a company that uses Haskell in your company, any insight would be much appreciated!
 Thank you

                    <span>AsciiDoc is a plain-text
writing format that tries to combine the readability and intuitiveness of
Markdown with the rigorous requirements of technical authoring and publishing.
It offers power and flexibility without resorting to HTML or tool-specific
extensions for essential syntax such as tables, description lists, footnotes,
or features like automatically generating a table of contents.
This post presents a new AsciiDoc parser and converter in Haskell, called
asciidoc-hs. It has been developed
with the support of a Tweag Open Source Fellowship, and is BSD licensed. It
aims to be the first AsciiDoc processor that can be directly used as a Pandoc
front-end1. It is still far from complete
in terms of AsciiDoc syntax and features, but it hopefully establishes a solid
foundation to build up…</span>

                    <span>Hey there,
 So I use &#x27;Swiper&#x27; but have found that it chugs like crazy on a huge log file (ex: Takes a minute to process a query if its a specific date in a log file).
 I currently use Helm and Company in my config.
 I mention this because I tried employing this workaround in this GitHub post, but it uses Ivy unfortunately:
 https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/416
 ​
 This is the workaround:
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-s&quot; &#x27;ora-swiper)
 ​
 (defun ora-swiper ()
 (interactive)
 (if (and (buffer-file-name)
 (not (ignore-errors
 (file-remote-p (buffer-file-name))))
 (if (eq major-mode &#x27;org-mode)
 (&gt; (buffer-size) 60000)
 (&gt; (buffer-size) 300000)))
 (progn
 (save-buffer)
 (counsel-grep))
 (swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates))))
 ​
 Any ideas on how to avoid conflicts and what I could use instead? It appears from the workaround the &#x27;counsel-grep&#x27; is the way to go though (which I believe is the front-end for &#x27;ripgrep&#x27;).
 ​
 I&#x27;m assuming I would have to find Helm&#x27;s version of &#x27;swiper--ivy (swiper--candidates)&#x27; instead, but wanted to confirm this.
 ​
 Or should I somehow figure out how to grep the entire file for a search query, and redirect it to a new temporary buffer instead?

                    <span>Hi, 
 Repost with a more descriptive header after suggestion from github-alphapapa. :)
 I am a bit lost and need some help to get nudged in the right direction. 
 Using Doom Emacs and Org mode with Org Roam.
 I&#x27;ve set up a set of org-roam-capture-templates. When I try to create a new file, by entering a filename that does not exist, with Org-roam-find-file (SPC n r f), I am prompted with the Capture templates. 
 Before I set up Capture templates, a new file would be created when I entered a filename that did not exist.
 What I want is for the file to be created, as it did before I set up Capture templates.
 I&#x27;ve tried Googling and reading in the manual, but I must be missing it.
 Does anyone know what I can read up on and provide a link, or maybe let me know what I&#x27;ve missed? If you let me know what I&#x27;ve missed, I would be very grateful if you could tip me on what I should have read in order to figure it out myself.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I am running into a weird issue with Emacs recently. I am declaring directory-local variable in a .dir-locals.el, e.g., 
 ((nil . ((pyvenv-workon . &quot;fancy-python-env&quot;)))) 
 When I open a file in the same directory as my .dir-locals.el for the first, emacs used to ask me whether to mark the newly declared variable as safe. But recently, I must have messed something up in emacs config because it longer asks me, but simply prints a warning message:
 Ignoring unsafe file local variable: pyvenv-workon 
 Any way I can revert to the previous behavior of Emacs regarding local variables?

                    <span>In Emacs Lisp, is there a built in system or third party package that helps you trace variables?
 I’m thinking of two ways I might want to do this. 
  
Like trace-function, but for variables i.e. producing a log of updates to a variable
 With a “watch list” buffer like IDEs usually have that updates defined variables or expressions when the variables change
  
I looked through the manual and searched a bit and have not really found anything. This seems like such obvious functionality though so I feel like I must have just missed it. Thought I’d ask here before rolling my own. 
 How are people tracing variables in Elisp?

                    <span>I have a somewhat ugly library I wrote for personal use that sends out emails in bulk when I&#x27;ve finished a task (in this case, grading student papers). Right now I use high-level functions to compose an email in a message-mode buffer via mu4e. But it seems like it would be smarter to just assemble the email as a string (or maybe in a hidden buffer) and then send it using sendmail-program. Has anyone done this kind of thing, and is it hard? I can keep using mu4e if it&#x27;s the best option, but it&#x27;s somewhat slow and I&#x27;d like to reduce the latency if possible. thanks!

 Is this supposed to be normal behaviour?
 Is there some way to write the linefeeds which will prevent this from happening?

                    <span>Edit: I fixed it. It was the package powerline, which modifies the way the minibuffer looks. I just disabled it.
 I&#x27;ve upgraded to 27.2 (Windows). My minibuffer has trippled in size (vertically). 
 I&#x27;ve tried this to no avail:
 (setq resize-mini-windows nil) 
 I specifically get my emacs windows binaries from here if it matters: https://vigou3.gitlab.io/emacs-modified-windows/
 Anyone know how to fix this minibuffer problem?

                    <span>I am currently trying to figure out which library I shall use for the following scenario:
  
application will query a REST service that serves XML (preferred) or JSON
 that XML links to other endpoints that might get queried depending on user-interaction
 the served XML changes infrequently, usually less than once every 2h
  
Because the data gets changed relatively seldomly and I don&#x27;t want to query too much (rate-limits) I want to cache the responses.
 Is anyone doing something similar? What library can you recommend?
  
Currently I am thinking about the following options:
  
hedis: seems a good suit but I will need to figure out Redis
 acid-state or TCache: seem the next best suit?
 beam-sqlite: seems sub-optimal as I don&#x27;t really need persistence but I am familiar with it
  
What options/libraries am I overlooking? Preferably, I would like a more light-weight solution and avoiding pulling in too many dependencies.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [alpha, beta, gamma]
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;
 [ alpha , beta , gamma ] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 First, it is the friendliest with diff tools. Second, those commas separate the expressions and also separate the lines. Last, it is symmetrical.

                    <span>I am happy to announce that I have released my new library - rrb-vector. It provides an implemention of the RRB-Vector data structure, which can be used as an alternative to Data.Sequence.Seq a (from the containers package).
 It supports very fast indexing/updating and iteration (faster than for Seq a), while other operations, like concatenation, append, prepend, take, drop, etc. are also quite efficient. Most of the operations have a complexity of O(log n), but since the logarithms are base 16, that behaves more like O(1) in most cases.
 For more information, see the documentation on Hackage. I&#x27;d be happy for your feedback!

                    <span>This is something I&#x27;ve been trying to do for a while: have an all-day event (like a vacation, or a holiday) marked in a different color than the other events on the agenda so it stands out and easy to find later (good use-case example for me: marking sick days so I can later write them out on our monthly reports). 
 It&#x27;s a bit long, but it contains a lot of different bits of information I hope you&#x27;d find useful. Enjoy!

                    <span>I have two diaries I have written in org-mode, and both of them have entries in top-level headlines, where the next line is an inactive timestamp, like:
 * This is an top-level headline :headlines:orgmode:reddit: [2021-06-14 Mon 13:19] Diary entry goes here. Lots of multiline text. 
 Originally, these diary entries were in reverse chronological order. At some point, I forgot and started adding new entries at the bottom of the document. At this point, the change in order is about halfway through the document. I know I could start moving individual headlines up to the top, one by one, with M-S-up/down, but there are hundreds of entries, and I&#x27;d rather do one command that sorts the entire document.
 Is there an org-mode command that will sort all of the headlines in the document based on the inactive timestamp? Preferably with the options of either chronological or reverse chronological order?

                    <span>For Python I know the open-source library great_expectations. Since we use Spark with Scala, I&#x27;d like to know what my options are for libraries that do something similar in Scala. Thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve looked at various templating engines and Scala.js frameworks/APIs, Twirl etc., but all of them appear to be either purely client-side or server-side. Does anything like this exist on the JVM? 
 In some ways it feels like using a template engine, but the end-user experience is much nicer, because data is streamed from the server and everything is written on/for the backend. Almost, like a hybrid between, say, Twirl and Scala.JS/Laminar, except that client-server communication appears to be entirely transparent to the developer.

                    <span>Hi all!   I have just discovered Zettelkasten via Sonke Ahrens&#x27;s book (How to take smart notes).  I have downloaded ZKN3, and have noticed all &#x27;how to&#x27; videos on youtube are all in German.  Can anyone provide me with any links in English to help me get started?

                    <span>This post could just as easily have gone in the Workflows category, but I ultimately thought it would live better here.
I have been debating about the use of so-called &quot;literature notes&quot; for a while now (actually, since I first learned of them). The definition seemed a bit nebulous. Reading Ahrens&#x27;s book, I got the impression that literature notes were more or less bibliographic entries. They had references to some pages along with keywords and key ideas, but were mostly used for reference. And, being so, they were stored. They were permanent.
Then, reading here, I got the impression from Christian and many others that literature notes were literally notes taken on the literature (or in a notebook): marginalia, brief comments, reminders, etc. Their goal under this view is to be processed a…</span>

                    <span>At least it&#x27;s not evil-mode!
 This is a joke of course. Centaur-tabs is a great package, and I can see it becoming a nifty part of my workflow, but can&#x27;t help think about how buffer-focused emacs is, and yet, tabs are a pretty standard feature in every editor and browser now. I think the tab-bar is a great visual indicator of the open buffers. And DOOM seems to have some nice integrations for it. 
 Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
 Edit - yes, I&#x27;ve leaned into the buffer-centric workflow for a year or more now but tab-bar mode or whatever it is that centaur-tabs offers works for me. https://xkcd.com/1172/

                    <span>I left Linux over a decade ago for OSX. I started using Emacs about 10 years ago.
 I started fooling around with Linux the other day (Pop OS). I just assumed that installing Emacs via &#x27;apt&#x27; would provide me with Emacs 27.x... No dice.
 To keep up to date on Emacs are people really building from source? Is there a package repo that keeps an up to date version?
 If I&#x27;m going to build it myself are there any options I should consider. It&#x27;s a bit embarrassing that I&#x27;m so used to the install and go experience I&#x27;ve been getting with Emacs on the Mac.
 Edit: Turns out it was org-tempo and org-indent-mode, both of which I believe I added for Emacs 27... I can&#x27;t remember if I upgraded to 27 for a specific reason or not on OS X, so I can forget ahead with 26 for now with those disabled.
 Thanks all.

                    <span>dyncloze is an emacs module (offered via Melpa) for testing yourself on language learning. The core idea is that you can take any piece of text in emacs, and form &quot;clozes&quot; (an Anki terminology), that erase the work in question and let you guess what it should be. For example, you can test, in English &quot;in&quot; vs. &quot;on&quot;, and every location of those words will be replaced by a cloze, denoted by &quot;[ ]&quot; and you are led through each of them and asked to guess each one. At the end, it tells you how well you did.
 In version 0.1, we started with the ability just to test two or more words against each other. With this version, 0.2 (just submitted, not yet updated on Melpa), we add the ability to use regex&#x27;s for testing. That opens the ability to do more useful testing, at least with European languages that have a lot of word variants and word-ending grammatical bits.
 I&#x27;ve added two example files, one for Spanish, one for Portuguese to demonstrate. You can load them up and try out functions such as dyncloze-es-ser-estar, which will let you guess every variant of ser and estar (&quot;eras&quot;, &quot;fui&quot;, &quot;está&quot;, &quot;estaba&quot;, etc.), but you just choose which of the verbs it belongs to: ser or estar. There&#x27;s a similar function that lets you choose between perfect and imperfect tenses.
 If you&#x27;d like to contribute, please open pull requests for the language you are studying with more examples (or fix up an issues with the ones I have).

                    <span>I&#x27;m running Emacs (from Homebrew) in iTerm2(build 3.4.8) on Mac OS Big Sur(11.4), When trying universal negative key C-M-- in Emacs it said &quot;C-M-_ is undefined&quot;, not sure how to make this work since this is quite important key chord to maintain the tempo.
 ​
 It seems that only M-- works, C-- is C-_ which is undo command instead.
 Any ideas? Thanks a lot.

                    <span>Does anyone have the feeling that text in emacs (GUI) doesn&#x27;t look as good as vscode? There&#x27;s something about them or the color theme that looks slightly grainy and not as crisp.

                    <span>Hello everybody! I want to set my python interpreter to run inside docker. Pycharm has this instructions. Is this something that can be done in Emacs?
 To give more context, I want to run my tests inside the docker environment and debugger (pdb) with a correct project mapping (so my local path can point to the remote path when debugging and viceversa)
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                    <span>Hello! I present to you my first emacs package - atp. It&#x27;s intended as a component for writing text editing commands and augmenting modal editing modes. Its main feature is the ability to automatically recognize and highlight things at point and apply commands to highlighted things or active region.
 I started working on this package because I was lookig for a new approach that would help me save a couple of keystrokes on each common task such as copying and pasting text, evaluation of lisp expressions and shell-commands, changing letter case, etc.
 For a year I used a wonderful package &quot;expand-region&quot; for that purpose. Despite it being very smart and useful, it requires 2 actions to select an object under the point. First, the user must navigate to the desired location, and then call er/expand-region to select an object. I thought that the second step was redundant and decided to write a package that will work without it.
 At this moment atp is unstable because it was written in a hurry and my knowledge of elisp and emacs internals isn&#x27;t great. I just wanted to write something usable as soon as I could to check the viability of the chosen approach. Here is a repo and a video that demonstrates how atp works in the context of a tiny modal editing mode.

 What do you think about it?

                    <span>Is there a path (and the will) to give Functor a superclass? This excludes Functor F if F has a nominal role
 class (forall x y. x~𝈖y &#x3D;&gt; f x~𝈖f y) &#x3D;&gt; Functor f 
 where (~𝈖) &#x3D; Coercible.
 With this deriving Traversable-like type classes and Distributive becomes possible, as well as type classes with lenses.
 As a reference MonadTrans just got a QuantifiedConstraint superclass
 class (forall m. Monad m &#x3D;&gt; Monad (trans m)) &#x3D;&gt; MonadTrans trans 
 But this will be more challenging, it really depends on if this is something the community wants.

                    <span>A noob who just finished the Haskell book here.
 Should I be concerned with strictness at this point? For example, should I worry about sharing and practice writing code accordingly or be concerned with optimization only when it actually becomes a performance issue?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up a system in org-mode to manage my family&#x27;s daily chores. I figured org-habit would be the best starting point, but I have a few ideas I&#x27;m not sure how to implement because I&#x27;m pretty new.
 First, I want to assign the same chore (TODO item) to different family members on different days. Say, Mom does the dishes on Monday, I do them Tuesday, one of the children does them Wednesday, etc...
 Second, I want to understand how to build a break down in org-agenda to view the whole chore list for a day, week, etc, or by individual.
 Any links to read or suggestions would be a big help, thanks!

                    <span>Hi all,
 The construction of my aggregate is side-effectful. I need to go to the DB, check for some invariants, then decide if I can construct it or not.
 While with side effect-free construction, I&#x27;d just create a smart constructor in a companion objects. For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create(...): Either[Error, Aggregate] &#x3D; ??? } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Since now my creation is side effectful, I consider a few options:
 Option #1 - separate class for the factory
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Aggregate(...)
 class AggregateFactory[F[_]](repository: Repository[F]) { def create(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] &#x3D; ??? } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Then I&#x27;d just pass AggregateFactory around where needed.
 Option #2 - curried smart constructor
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Aggregate(...)
 object Aggregate { def create[F[_]](repository: Repository[F])(...): F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] &#x3D; ??? } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and then I could pass around just the partially applied create function, e.g.
 scala def factory[F[_]]: ... &#x3D;&gt; F[Either[Error, Aggregate]] &#x3D; Aggregate.create(repository)(_) 
 What do you think is the most idiomatic approach to the side-effectful construction?

                    <span>This is a quirk I ran into recently, and am wondering if someone can provide some insight about it.
 I have an abstract trait with a type param that represents some intermediate representation (IR) that can be converted to the type param:
  trait IR[O] { def toOutput: O } 
 I have a concrete implementation of this trait:
  case class StringIR(data: String) extends IR[(Int, String)] { def toOutput: (Int, String) &#x3D; (data.length, data) } 
 Then I want to define a circe Encoder for the IR trait, assuming the O already has an Encoder.
 This is the first way I implemented it:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R  Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 But when I try to get an implicit Encoder for StringIR it results in a compiler error:
  diverging implicit expansion for type io.circe.Encoder[StringIR] starting with lazy value currencyEncoder in object Encoder 
 An interesting thing I noticed is that the error doesn&#x27;t always mention the currencyEncoder. Sometimes it&#x27;s other provided encoders.
 So then I implemented the encoder like this:
  implicit def encoder[O : Encoder, R  Encoder[O].apply(r.toOutput) } 
 The only difference is that I&#x27;m using Encoder[R with IR[O]] instead of Encoder[R]. 
 Here&#x27;s a Scastie with a working example: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/VvnYuNiGS5SN7R5GwV5cHg/25 
 It seems like the implicit resolution doesn&#x27;t know that an Encoder[R with IR[O]] is the same as an Encoder[R]. I know I used Circe here, but I don&#x27;t see how it would be any different for any old type class. Is there any more precise explanation for this?

I use straight.el&#x27;s integration with use-package for managing all my packages. I do this by setting:
 (setq straight-use-package-by-default t) 
 I want to use ebib and biblio together. So, per the ebib manual, I stuck this in my config:
 (use-package ebib-biblio :after (ebib biblio) :bind (:map biblio-selection-mode-map (&quot;e&quot; . ebib-biblio-selection-import))) 
 This didn&#x27;t work. I got a warning that the package ebib-biblio could not be found. I realised that this was because I was using the straight version of use-package, which (only?) looks for packages in the repos, when in this case ebib-biblio is distributes as part of ebib. This didn&#x27;t produce any warnings:

                    <span>Hi all, 
 As there seems to be a demand for practical Haskell examples/applications, I decided to create a video series to show an example of how such an application could be developed. In this case I chose to show how to process streamed binary satellite data and build a Haskell application for this. This starts with basic things like network connections, conduits, goes over logging, config file handling, command line parsing to parsing the binary ground- and space-protocols involved, threading (for parallel processing chains), STM and finally displaying the results in a graphical user interface (with GTK). 
 This also can serve as an introduction to the AURIS mission control system I am writing in Haskell (on ZuriHac and MuniHac there was some demand for more explanations as the project is a bit intimidating and requires some domain knowledge). So I thought I could combine this and provide some insight into this domain, while showing how such an application could work in Haskell. 
 Each video builds on its predecessor. The current ones are: 
  
Video 1: Introduction and Project Setup 
 Video 2: Network Connections and Conduits 
 Video 3: Configuration Files 
 Video 4: Command Line Arguments 
 Video 5: Parsing the Transport Protocol Layer 
 Video 6: Parsing the TM Transfer Layer 
 Video 7: CRC Check, Interfacing C++, Property Tests 
 Video 8: Logging and the RIO Monad
 
 Further ones are planned, but not yet available.
 I might be going quickly sometimes (as I wanted to focus on certain areas and the videos are already quite long), so if there is a demand for more detailed explanations of certain things, let me know.
 The video series as a Youtube playlist:

                    <span>Compilers for languages such as Rust have seen great success in giving each compiler error a unique error code such as E0119. The code can easily be looked up in official documentation and referred to in forums, StackOverflow, etc.. There is work underway which could lead to the same functionality in GHC.
 I wondered whether there&#x27;s a particularly strong reason for numeric error codes as opposed to human readable identifiers. For example, would conflicting_trait_implementations be a more useful error code than E0119? None of the reasons given in the discussion for avoiding readable error codes rang true for me, and, surprisingly to me, no one at all supported readable error codes.
 Are my instincts completely out of tune on this issue, or would readable error codes have some benefit over numeric ones?

 I have tried commenting the org-super-agenda-group setting but its still like this. Can anybody help?
 EDIT
  
checked org-agenda-files variable, seems to be in order
 
Tried removing org-super-agenda, doesn&#x27;t change anything.
