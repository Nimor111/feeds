                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with using GNUS for email. I have several emails configured thus far and seem to have only one strange issue. For example, here is an obfuscated portion of the config:
  (use-package gnus :ensure nil :custom (gnus-select-method &#x27;(nnnil nil)) (gnus-summary-exit-hook &#x27;gnus-summary-expire-articles) (gnus-secondary-select-methods &#x27;((nnimap &quot;mymail&quot; (nnimap-address &quot;mail.mymail.com&quot;) (nnimap-server-port &quot;imaps&quot;) (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnir-search-engine imap) (nnmail-expiry-target &quot;nnimap+mymail:Trash&quot;) (nnmail-expiry-wait immediate))) 
 In particular I want messages to expire immediately and be moved into my Trash folder. When I am inside a group summary, I can manually mark messages as Expired with E. Then I could manually expire them with B e or M-x gnus-summary-expire-articles. When I exit the summary buffer the messages appear in the Trash folder as expected. However I also have the gnus-summary-exit-hook set to call the same function. This configuration is actually unnecessary since that is the default setting. When I just exit the summary buffer, I see Expiring articles...done . . . but they aren&#x27;t moved to the Trash folder. 
 I am pretty confused by this behavior as I see no difference between the two invocations of gnus-summary-expire-articles. My config is also almost a mirror of most recent GNUS guides/configurations so I feel like I must be missing something simple or everyone else would experience the same behavior.
 Has anyone else had this issue?

 SOLVED: You need to install debugpy (source /venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install debupy) inside the virtual environment.

It has no mouse hover text. It shows up in all my buffers, even *scratch*. I don&#x27;t have any fancy doom-modeline customizations. Anyone have an idea?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to configure Emacs as an Email client, currently using IMAPS correctly. Issue being that, when I&#x27;m trying to send mail with the configured mail, I get asked the SMTP server, even though I have configured it through smtpmail-multi.el.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs Doom with Emacs 29.1. And Gnus IMAPS is using the auth-sources configured (maos-keychain-generic) correctly. Reading the smtp Emacs documentation, it apparently can use .authinfo?, which I&#x27;m not using but, another way in auth-sources that works when fetching but someone not when sending. This authentication also works when using IRC circe.
 ​
 Here&#x27;s my configuration:
 (add-to-list &#x27;smtpmail-multi-accounts &#x27;(gmail . (&quot;mymail@yes.com&quot; &quot;smtp.gmail.com&quot; 587 &quot;mymail@yes.com&quot; starttls nil nil nil))) (add-to-list &#x27;smtpmail-multi-accounts &#x27;(gmail . (&quot;mysecondmail@no.com&quot; &quot;smtp.gmail.com&quot; 587 &quot;mysecondmail@no.com&quot; starttls nil nil nil))) (add-to-list &#x27;smtpmail-multi-associations &#x27;(&quot;mymail@yes.com&quot; gmail)) (add-to-list &#x27;smtpmail-multi-associations &#x27;(&quot;mysecondmail@no.com&quot; gmail)) (setq smtpmail-servers-requiring-authorization &quot;\\.com&quot;) ;; More Sending configurations (require &#x27;org-mime) (setq org-mime-library &#x27;mml) (add-hook &#x27;message-send-hook &#x27;org-mime-confirm-when-no-multipart) (setq gnus-dribble-ignore t) 
 Also, these mails have each a lot of contacts that I would need for auto complete, or at least get my mails autocompleted. How do you manage contacts?.
 ​
 TLDR. Updated way to use the integrated SMTP send with different mails.

                              <span>hi, I have created a virtual dired buffer grouping several directories containing .org and .md notes.
 I would like to start a deadgrep search within these subfolders... but deadgrep needs a base folder...not a list of folders.
 I am under Windows10, so fzf in emacs does not work (it does under the CMD... but I want to stay in emacs).
 can you point me please to some direction on how to do this? thanks

 What I&#x27;d love to be able to do is to essentially build an agenda view that parses my goals and sorts/groups them by the timeline etc. 
 I don&#x27;t currently have TODO states for my goals as they are larger projects, but I could add them if required to get them to show up in the agenda. 
 What I&#x27;m looking for is some sort of tutorial or guide to how exactly custom agenda functions work.

 However during install (sudo -E make install), I keep getting this error. I think my LD_LIBRARY_PATH is correct and I have the tree sitter

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best practice to have your custom elisp natively compiled, along with external packages?
 So far I&#x27;ve only succeeded by doing the following: - Move my custom elisp to a new file (emacs-lib.el) which starts with (provide &#x27;emacs-lib) - Manually run emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load while visiting that file - Change my init file to load the library:
 (setq elisp-dir &quot;~/config/elisp&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path elisp-dir) (require &#x27;emacs-lib) 
 After restarting Emacs, I&#x27;ve checked that many of my custom functions are indeed native-compiled.
 It would be nice if I could have my init file take care of compiling the library when missing or outdated. Even better if I didn&#x27;t need the separate file, but that&#x27;s no big deal.

 Maybe someone could help spotting the error?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that Laminar and the newly released Kyo point that they don&#x27;t use a lot of macros as a feature. Laminar says &quot;Easy to understand: no macros&quot;, while Kyo emphasizes &quot;Note: defer is currently the only macro in Kyo. All other features use regular language constructs.&quot; It seems that using less macros is something library users will like.
 While I understand that macros were a problem in the past (Scala 2), and that using them, even in their present form is not for the faint-hearted. My understanding is that, for the user, that should not be a problem (if the macros/libraries are well written). The black magic that macros can introduce, should make the user&#x27;s life easier. Do you avoid libraries that use macros? Why?

                              <span>In a cabal project all the modules must be explicitly listed for building in the .cabal. This would usually result in a very long list of modules. Is there a way/work in progress for regex support to efficiently list them? Like say Utils.* which would recursively include all modules?
 If no or if this might be an anti pattern for some reason, how do very large projects manage this efficiently? Do they copy paste the path by hand for literally every single module?
 I have also seen some projects on github like ShellCheck which first make a library, expose all the modules and then simple add that do build-depends of the final executable. Is this the recommended approach than having just one executable and adding all the modules to other-modules:?

                              <span>I have an org mode document that consists pretty much entirely of top level headlines with properties.
 So far, I have written a couple functions to grab individual properties and grab all properties, then a wrapper that uses completing-read to let me pick a headline and return all properties. Currently, that wrapper only lets me search by headline, because I&#x27;m using completing-read to grab the headline then feeding that headline into my &quot;get-all-properties&quot; function. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying (and failing) to find a way to search by property as well as headline - i.e. If I have headline &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, and &#x27;C&#x27; with property &#x27;:GROUP:&#x27; equal to &#x27;test&#x27; , and &#x27;D&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, and &#x27;F&#x27; with &#x27;:GROUP:&#x27; equal to &#x27;answer&#x27;, I want to show the list of headlines as usual (A,B,C,D,E,F) but type &#x27;test&#x27; into the minibuffer, and narrow the options down to just A B and C. 
 The closest option to this that I found was the &#x27;alt-completing-read&#x27; function (defined more here) but that only seems to let you search by the first element in the alist, not the second.
 If anyone knows of a way to achieve this, I&#x27;d appreciate any advice, thanks!

                              <span>Hi there, 
 I want to try emacs in my terminal-based workflow. I use tiling window manager (i3 - qtile) in ubuntu 
 so super+number changes the workspace. When starting an emacs with -nw, changing workspaces
 super+[1, 2, 3, etc] inserts &quot;IOIOIO&quot; characters in my buffer.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey there, I&#x27;m trying to do a custom config using Orgmode to manage init.el; however, I seem to have hit a snag and cannot seem to install packages. I&#x27;ve tried a few different routes including DT’s GNU Emacs Config with a few modifications. Could you help me figure out where I&#x27;m going wrong? The tangle to the init.el seems to work fine. After opening emacs with the code below, I get messages saying that the packages cannot load. Sorry to be a bother, I&#x27;m just getting back into emacs and it seems my previous configs don&#x27;t work and I&#x27;m hitting a few hiccups.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle &quot;/home/user/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;~/Dropbox/emaconfig.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) #+END_SRC #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (package-refresh-contents) (package-initialize) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (setq use-package-always-ensure t) (use-package doom-themes) (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t ; if nil, bold is universally disabled doom-themes-enable-italic t) ; if nil, italics is universally disabled (load-theme &#x27;doom-one t) #+END_SRC #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (setq org-hide-leading-stars t) #+END_SRC 
 Edit: fixed the reddit code formatting

                              <span>I wrote a library that lets you cycle through the available themes in Emacs. F10 and shift-F10 keys will cycle forward and backward through the themes. The theme name is printed for reference.
 https://github.com/tsengf/theme-cycle
 Installation
 Download theme-cycle.el into ~/.emacs.d.
 Add the following to your Emacs configuration
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path (expand-file-name &quot;~/.emacs.d)
 (require &#x27;theme-cycle)
 ;; Load as many themes as you are interested in exploring.
 (use-package doom-themes)
 (use-package ef-themes)
 (use-package modus-themes)
 (use-package solarized-themes)
 To Use
 Use F10 to cycle forward through the themes. Use shift-F10 to cycle backward through the themes.

                              <span>Thank you to /u/minad for inspiring the Emacs Advent Calendar!
 alphapapa, tarsius, and I just released v0.3.0 of hyperdrive.el!
 Prot and I are presenting the new features at EmacsConf tomorrow!
 Highlights of v0.3.0:
  
Added a new interface to hyperdrive-mirror which uses new features from Transient v0.5.0
 Redesigned the *hyperdrive-mirror* buffer to use taxy-magit-section
 Added support for starting and stopping hyper-gateway from within Emacs on machines without systemd
 Add customization options for displaying hyperdrives using format-spec
  
Some more goodies:
  
Basic Embark integration
 find-file-at-point integration
 Support following relative links in hyperdrive markdown files
 Internally, hyperdrive.el now uses shorthands.el
  
For the full set of changes, please check out the hyperdrive.el CHANGELOG.
 By the time the talk airs, v0.3.0 should be available on NonGNU ELPA and MELPA!
 I&#x27;m excited to see what other projects folks are working on this Emacs Advent!
 Join us for the second day of EmacsConf!!!

 * header 1 ** DONE task 1 ** TODO task 2 :PROPERTIES: :TRIGGER: chain-find(walk-up 1 forward-no-wrap 1 walk-down 1) todo!(TODO) :END: * header 2 ** task 1 ** task 2

                              <span>Hi,
 as a long-time vim (and emacs noobie) user I am using emacs for orgmode and have &quot;(sqet evil-want-minibuffer t)&quot; in my init.el.
 The problem is now that this seems to interfere with orgmode because in the date-picker that you get when inserting a time-stamp S- is now bound to evil-backward-word-begin and not to the function that moves the date one day back (the same happens for S-. S- and S- work as expected).
 Is there a way to have evil-mode in the minibuffer yet use the usual orgmode keybindings in the date picker?
 Many thanks!

 My goal is to use codeblocks in my custom.org Orgmode file in ~/Dropbox write out to ~/user/.emacs.d/init.el
 I&#x27;m trying to use the org-babel-tangle function, but seem to be stuck on how to write it out and the direction of the target. How close am I with the following code? I&#x27;m just getting back into emacs and am still fuzzy and any help would be appreciated, thanks!

 I use helm most of the time but that functionality may be counsel or consult.
 Can anyone refresh my mind?

                              <span>Graal Native Image is a technology to compile Java code ahead-of-time to a lightweight native binary executable, which has the advantages of smaller resources, starts in milliseconds, no warmup needed, and reduce attack surface. The serialization in graalvm is tricky and slow since it doesn&#x27;t support reflection, jit, and bytecode manipulation. Many performance optimization can&#x27;t be applied in graalvm.
 In Fury 0.4.0 version, Fury can run on GraalVM native image efficiently and is super easy-to-use. Neither reflection nor meta config are needed. Fury generates all code for Fury JIT framework and MethodHandle/LambdaMetafactory at graalvm native image build time. Then use those generated code for serialization at runtime without any extra cost, the performance is great.
 Compared to native JDK serialization, Fury can be 46x faster than JDK, and less than half of the serialized size.
 See https://github.com/alipay/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/graalvm_guide.md for example and benchmarks.
 This is a big step for jvm serialization, please give it a try and share us with your feedbacks.

                              <span>Hey! 👋 I&#x27;ve been pondering the idea of diving into Scala and wanted to reach out to the community for some insights. If you&#x27;ve got experience with Scala or have opinions on it, I&#x27;d love to hear from you!
 Why should I learn Scala? What are the pros and cons?
 I&#x27;ve heard that Scala is a powerful and versatile language, but I&#x27;m curious about the real-world experiences of those who have used it. What advantages does Scala bring to the table, and are there any drawbacks that one should be aware of?
 Here are a few questions to get the discussion going:
 Pros:
  
What specific features of Scala do you find most beneficial in comparison to other languages, especially Java?
 Have you found Scala to be particularly well-suited for certain types of projects or domains?
 How has Scala&#x27;s support for functional programming influenced your coding style and project architecture?
  
Cons:
  
Are there challenges or pitfalls you&#x27;ve encountered while working with Scala that newcomers should be aware of?
 How does Scala&#x27;s learning curve compare to other languages, and what resources would you recommend for someone starting out?
 Are there any specific scenarios or types of projects where Scala might not be the best fit?
  
Feel free to share your experiences, tips, or any resources you think would be helpful for someone considering learning Scala. I&#x27;m excited to hear your perspectives! 🚀

                              <span>Hello! I am in the process of learning Haskell, and the first AoC problem looked like it had something to do with updating State. I managed to solve it with the help of State Monad, although I don&#x27;t feel myself very proud of my solution. I think it&#x27;s quite convoluted and probably not too haskellish (I don&#x27;t know if this term exists, but I come from Python and in this community they use the term Pythonic a lot). I have still a long way until writing idiomatic code, so please, if you have suggestions to improve it let me know. 
 Thanks in advance!!
 This is the solution:

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Im currently in my first Semester of studying Computer Science and i have to install haskell since we&#x27;re currently learning that. I only have a windows laptop and have already tried using the Linux subsystem, but this never works. The University hasnt given us any tutorial on how to do it and every youtube video does it very differently, so im really unsure on what i have to do.
 So is there any good tutorial/better way of getting haskell onto my Windows Laptop?
 Any help is appreciated! (Also sorry if my english is weird, its my 3rd language)

                              <span>I’m from JVM world (Scala). Found Haskell extremely interesting, Completely fine with all the basic things, including type classes, types, laziness, etc. I’m using VS Code with hls 2.4.0.0 Only few questions. Is it possible to: - get functionality renaming term under the cursor (including all the references in the current project) - navigate to the source (outside the project, into base, into imported libs) - automatic refactoring during moving file between folders (all corresponding imports, etc) Thanks a lot.

                              <span>I cannot write the simplest Haskell program without having it giving me compilation error due to types. Syntax isn&#x27;t a concern, I guess.
 Besides, I really feel like I did not grasp the whole concept of Functional Programming yet.
 How can I change this? I just REALLY want to write something in Haskell without having my screen flooded with compilation errors.

                              <span>When I tried the latest Haskell AoC template by Martinsos, my first impression was that I didn&#x27;t want cabal to build and install all kinds of dependencies when they where all already available in my Nix store, so I set to add Nix support, but the author preferred to keep their template simple (which I think is a very sensible option).
 So I provided a version that only based on Nix : kephas/aoc-2023-haskell-template

                              <span>Hi r/haskell, we are a research team at Monash University, interested in interactive tools for functional programming. For one of our projects, we created a Haskell puzzle game called Zero to Hero. 
 Here, we invite you to explore 10 unique puzzles; each challenges you to implement a seemingly impossible function. The only help you have is a handful of strange-looking helper functions and your own wits. The game starts easy but quickly elevates into total madness. 
 You can choose to participate in the study or play for fun without any data collection at all. No stress. More details are explained on the landing page. 
 I hope you enjoy the game! I will answer any question in this thread.

 My solution for today:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues :: String -&gt; Int calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues x &#x3D; sum . map parseCalibrationInput $ lines x
 parseCalibrationInput :: String -&gt; Int parseCalibrationInput &#x3D; read . (\x -&gt; [head x, last x]) . filter isNumber
 calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues&#x27; :: String -&gt; Int calculateSumOfAllCalibrationValues&#x27; x &#x3D; sum . fmap (parseCalibrationInput . parseSpelledOutDigits) $ lines x
 parseSpelledOutDigits :: String -&gt; String parseSpelledOutDigits x &#x3D; foldr ((x, y) acc -&gt; replace x y acc) x [ (&quot;one&quot;, &quot;1&quot;), (&quot;two&quot;, &quot;2&quot;), (&quot;three&quot;, &quot;3&quot;), (&quot;four&quot;, &quot;4&quot;), (&quot;five&quot;, &quot;5&quot;), (&quot;six&quot;, &quot;6&quot;), (&quot;seven&quot;, &quot;7&quot;), (&quot;eight&quot;, &quot;8&quot;), (&quot;nine&quot;, &quot;9&quot;) ]
 replace :: String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String replace original new whole@(x : y : xs) &#x3D; if original isPrefixOf whole then replace original new (x : new  xs) else x : replace original new (y : xs)
 replace _ _ [x] &#x3D; [x] replace _ _ [] &#x3D; []

 If i type c-h k to get a help command then press C-g it just exits as it should.
 Any ideas?

I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll have more questions in the future but my main question right now is recurring events. At the month level if I have an event happening every week. The current week&#x27;s instance is the only one that shows up.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s create an Emacs Advent calendar! It would be nice if for every day till Christmas someone takes the opportunity to showcase their Emacs work. It will be interesting to see what you are all working on.
 I&#x27;ll make a start - at the first of December I finally released stable versions of multiple of my packages. The Consult package provides search commands with live preview. Some of the commands run asynchronously. Consult reached version 1.0, a little more than three years after the first release 0.1 and with 2211 commits in the repository. These are the stable versions I have tagged today:
  
Consult 1.0: Search commands with live preview
 Corfu 1.0: Completion popup for code and text
 Cape 1.0: Completion backends for in-buffer completion
 Tempel 1.0: Template expansion
 Jinx 1.0: Spell checker based on Enchant
 OSM 1.0: OpenStreetMap viewer
 Org-Modern 1.1: Org styling
  
Furthermore I have released new versions of Vertico and Marginalia:
  
Vertico 1.5: Minibuffer Completion UI
 Marginalia 1.4: Minibuffer annotations, co-authored with Omar Antolín Camarena
  
All the packages are available from GNU ELPA and MELPA. I&#x27;ll refer you to the changelogs for the details regarding the releases. I am happy to hear your feedback. Thanks!

                              <span>Running 30.0.50. Is there a way (package?) that allows buffer completions? I&#x27;m typing the same words again and again in an org doc. I&#x27;d like to type a few letters and then be offered choices for completion - like in the mini-buffer.
 All googling led me to mini-buffer completions. None led me to text/org buffer.

                              <span>I have a setup that sort of gives what I&#x27;m looking for, but Emacs complains that I&#x27;m not doing it right.
 I have a large number of org-mode appointments that depend on the date of Easter. They are currently in the form of diary sexp, but I don&#x27;t really care what form they&#x27;re in; what I&#x27;m really trying to find is a general solution to &quot;When today is X days before Easter, show arbitrary message &#x27;X&#x27; in the org agenda. When today is Y days after Easter, show arbitrary message &#x27;Y&#x27; in the org agenda.&quot; (In all of my cases, Easter means &quot;the Easter within the current calendar year&quot;.)
 Emacs elegantly figures out the correct date for Easter, but Emacs also has a hard-coded list of Christian holidays that aren&#x27;t useful to me. Instead of a new hard-coded list of holidays, I&#x27;m looking to make arbitrary and changeable use of the Easter calculation - compared to today - without showing any holidays at all.

                              <span>TLDR: I really want to learn emacs, getting frustrated with the basics and seeking help. Can&#x27;t install use-package on my mac installation of emacs.
 I&#x27;ve been using neovim for awhile but have been increasingly frustrated with not being able to understand how things work when they break down. Hoping to learn emacs for fun and maybe to even replace/improve my nvim workflows.
 Things went well at first. I followed the tutorial and got used to some basic navigation as well as window and buffer navigation. I LOVE being able to &#x60;C-h&#x60; for functions, keys, and variables.
 I decided it was time to start trying to configure things and installing packages. I&#x27;m not patient enough to watch 10 hours of system crafters videos and didn&#x27;t really want to buy Mastering Emacs, so I decided to do some googling…</span>

                              <span>Friend of mine was perusing through her late father-in-law&#x27;s paper files over Thanksgiving break. She found fascinating research.
 I imagine my kids sifting through my stuff 50 years from now. If it&#x27;s all in Emacs, they won&#x27;t be able to sift through ANYTHING, because it&#x27;s not intuitive, not navigable. You can&#x27;t click on anything. They would have to learn a few dozen key commands to do ANYTHING. I get that they&#x27;re just text files, but I don&#x27;t think my family would know that. Evernote, on the other hand, while proprietary, is stupid simple to navigate. (FWIW I tend to use one big file with all my notes as org-headings. Maybe individual files would be more non-emacs-user friendly?)
 I know it&#x27;s weird and morbid, but I think about these things. Anyone else? I guess I&#x27;m thinking about long-term archival in a digital system.

                              <span>Hi,
 i am starting out with orgmode and would like to be able to see (and ideally sync 2-way) todos and appointments to my android device.
 So far I have looked into syncing calendar entries and have come up with this:
 Etar as calendar app, ICSx⁵ for syncing it with caldav, radicale as caldav server and org-caldav to sync orgmode.
 This setup works but looks ridiculously complex for such a simple use-case and so I wonder if this is really the way to do it.
 So my question is:
 What is your solution to the problem of getting your orgmode-stuff onto your phone? What apps do you use and how do you sync?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Since installing a new GNU-Linux distribution (MX-Linux), org-bullets-mode does not activate automatically when I open my org documents. I have to activate it manually (M-x org-bullets-mode). Yet, I haven&#x27;t changed anything in my previous configuration (init.el and config.org) and everything was working fine before. Thank you for pointing me towards a possible solution.
 My init.el:
 (org-babel-load-file 
 (expand-file-name &quot;config.org&quot; user-emacs-directory))
 And the part concerning org-bullets-mode in my config.org:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (require &#x27;org-bullets) 
 (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))) 
 #+end_src
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package org-bullets 
 :after org 
 :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode)
 :custom
 (org-bullets-bullet-list &#x27;(&quot;◉&quot; &quot;○&quot; &quot;●&quot; &quot;○&quot; &quot;●&quot; &quot;○&quot; &quot;●&quot;))) 
 #+end_src

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m trying to brush off my emacs and Orgmode since it&#x27;s been years. I&#x27;m hitting a few snags and am also wondering about current standards since there has been many updates.
 My goal: 
 Use Orgmode to customise my emacs and init files while using the Dropbox directory. I would also like to use a custom named init file so it&#x27;s like eckoinit.el instead of init.el (For easier recognition and modification).
 Overall, I&#x27;d like to sync and use emacs from different computers using the same configs.
 I know one of my current snags is I can&#x27;t remember how to tell emacs from Orgmode to use a differently named init file. I feel like this should be an obvious answer that I should have found by now and I feel silly. 
 Thanks for your time!

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 This is my first post every on reddit I hope I don&#x27;t get RTFM ed.
 Problem: Until about a week ago I used to use a doom emacs config I got off of the internet with some modifications just for references in latex. this week I finally decided to code my own literate gnu emacs config but there is one feature I am sorely missing. In the image attached in a org-mode document there is syntax highliting for latex code outside of src_code blocks I want that but I don&#x27;t know how to get it into my new config. Further information can be provided on request.

 I haven&#x27;t checked the doom themes, won&#x27;t they have trouble with packages not in doom?

 I&#x27;m a long time Emacs user, right now using the Doom framework and, I recently took a look at the power Nix, specifically the devenv.sh project. I wonder if someone is using it in some manner. As it being quite powerful and allowing having separate development environments. 
 ​
 Are there any packages for this?, and if not, how complicated would it to be to for example, once entering a project, Emacs gets all of its PATHs (languages like NodeJS and other niceties) so that little by little, the project can be replicated and used completely with devenv and Emacs without having to installing anything globally.
 ​
 Thank you, I would love to hear your workflows!, just wanting to be sure I&#x27;m getting the best of the best in my environment, I will be coding in Javascript, Angular and so on.

 This Emacs config&#x27;s built from scratch by this humble Elisp noob. I want it to be minimal and plain. Love some feedback!

 The problem I am facing currently is that every time i run 
 dap-debug 
 while the file is open i get prompted for executable and when i select the candidate, I get the error
 Wrong type argument: stringp, nil 
 From what I learned we get the above error when a function get a nil value while expecting a string but I don&#x27;t understand why the function will get a nil value when i selected the correct executable with appropriate compiler flags.
 I would appreciate any help in the matter.

                              <span>Hey everyone, quite a while ago I created the Naga theme; it&#x27;s also on MELPA. I used it for a long time (and I&#x27;m still using it in the evenings), but I&#x27;m not totally happy with it. I&#x27;d like to spend a little more time on it, changing some colors, updating the slightly outdated screenshots in the readme and so on. While I&#x27;m at it, I could have a look at packages that don&#x27;t work well with it as well. I have some other ideas for themes, and an improved naga would also give me a better base to work from for these.
 I&#x27;d be glad if some of you could maybe test-drive it and give me feedback, especially if it perhaps breaks or looks plain bad with some packages you use.
 The main idea of the theme was to get a &quot;more modern retro green&quot; theme, with high contrast, but a non-standard foreground color -- green in this case.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs Mac from Homebrew on my M1 Macbook Pro with the notch, and when I toggle fullscreen using (toggle-frame-fullscreen) I see that part of the top line of text gets hidden by the notch (like in image). In other applications fullscreen omits the entire top height of the notch, but for some reason Emacs fullscreen isn&#x27;t like other native fullscreen - the Emacs frame occupies the entire screen but is still in the Desktop space. So I lose words in the middle of the top line. How can I avoid this situation? I don&#x27;t see a ns-use-native-fullscreen variable (or any variables containing the words &quot;ns&quot;, &quot;native&quot;, or &quot;fullscreen&quot; that are useful).

                              <span>Hello emacs and Lisp enthusiasts,
 I remember seeing an article that talked about the superfluity of parenthesis in Lisp code, and how non-Lisp programmers were overwhelmed by them, but Lisp programmers had trained their eyes to look at indentation structure and didn&#x27;t see the parenthesis, and it showed an image of Lisp code without and with the parenthesis faded. I don&#x27;t have a link to the article, but even as a slightly seasoned Lisper I thought the fainter parenthesis improved readability. 
 So I&#x27;m wondering if/how it&#x27;s possible to achieve this effect in emacs. Is there already a minor-mode for it? Would it involve a font-lock/face for parenthesis? I&#x27;ve tried to navigate the syntax highlighting code before and was a bit turned off by the apparent complexity, so any form of introduction would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>ultra-scroll-mac: scroll like lightning
 Emacs-mac is a beautiful port, and was the first to offer pixel-precise smooth scrolling nearly a decade ago. But with modern high-resolution trackpads and high density displays, I found its scrolling handlers just couldn&#x27;t keep up. On large, full-screen buffers in a heavy mode, trackpad scrolling verged on painful, and, maddeningly, was much worse in one direction than the other. And no wonder: modern trackpads deliver scroll events &gt;50⨉ per second! The other key problem with all known smooth scrolling packages is they tend to stutter and loop back as you try to scroll across images taller than the window.
 This package solves both of these problems:
  
Scrolling performance has been increased 25-50⨉ — you move your fingers, the page responds, instantly.
 Large image handling has been worked around so you can scroll right across them without any hiccups.
 As a bonus, dumb mice get pretty good smooth(-ish) scrolling too.
  
I&#x27;ll be contributing the core scrolling functions upstream, so hopefully pixel-precision-scroll-mode (which inspired this package, and is recommended on other builds) can make use of some of these improvements in the future.
 Finally, this was all (to me) surprisingly hard to achieve, which you can read all about if you are a glutton.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I am a Neovim and Obsidian user and plan to move for my notes, and then for coding, to Emacs and org mode. I started to learn vanilla Emacs (and Elisp) week ago, and write simple notes in Emacs, the majority of my note taking is still done in Obsidian however. One feature I miss is a sidebar outlining the contents of the current file. I tend to have very big files and the sidebar makes it easy to navigate it.
 ![Like this sidebar on the right](https://i.imgur.com/uUSh5XR.png). I didn&#x27;t find the solution for this yet. I don&#x27;t aim to replicate my Obsidian setup fully, but I wonder if there is a plugin to this. Or maybe another alternative to navigating big org files.

                              <span>Recently, I got in to emacs org mode. I installed Doom emacs and I have been making my org file to suit my university schedule. It&#x27;s kinda fun I wont lie.
 While I was experimenting recurring tasks, trying to understand the difference between +1w, .+1w, and ++1w (still have no idea btw), I might have pressed something or done something bc now whenever I look at my org agenda my TODO tasks show up twice. Anyone know how to fix this problem? I couldn&#x27;t find any documentation on this issue...
 EDIT: I think this problem is caused by C-c [ .I made a TODO, it appears on the Org Agenda, when I do &quot;C-c [&quot; it appears to duplicate the TODO on the Org Agenda.
 5 TODOs
 makes 10 TODOs

                              <span>I&#x27;ve only been using GHC on Windows 10. Is there a VSCode addon that would just perform a predefined Haskell GHC compilation task (like Microsoft&#x27;s C/C++ addon does). I don&#x27;t need any other properties. So far I&#x27;ve just been manually compiling (command line) but it would be easier to avoid jumping into the console every time I want to compile.
 I won&#x27;t be installing anything on this computer so please do not talk about anything else than just the GHC task.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on some Monad exercises. I&#x27;ve solved the first exercise, but show it here because the second exercise uses it, and is the one I&#x27;m having some trouble with.
 First exercise:
  
Using a state of type [(a,Int)] we can keep track of the numbers of occurrences of elements of type a. For instance [(&#x27;a&#x27;,1),(&#x27;x&#x27;,3)] means that we&#x27;ve seen one &#x27;a&#x27; and three &#x27;x&#x27;s. 
 Implement a State monad operation count that registers the occurrence of the given value. 
 That is, the operation count x should fetch the pair (x,n) from the state, and replace it with the pair (x,n+1). If no such pair is found, the operation should add (x,1) to the state.
  
Examples:
  runState (count True) [] &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; ((),[(True,1)]) runState (count 7) [] &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; ((),[(7,1)]) runState (count &#x27;a&#x27;) [(&#x27;a&#x27;,1),(&#x27;b&#x27;,3)] &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; ((),[(&#x27;a&#x27;,2)…</span>

 I am struggling like crazy trying to understand this piece of code. 
 do word  [&quot;Blue1&quot;,&quot;Blue2&quot;,&quot;Blue3&quot;,&quot;Green1&quot;,&quot;Green2&quot;,&quot;Green3&quot;] 
 What is going on here? The result looks like a nested for loop, but I don&#x27;t get how is it possible? I know the do notation is syntactic sugar, but somehow for IO operations it makes much more sense to me that for lists... 
 I am a total beginner in Haskell, so sorry if this is a very silly question.

                              <span>Making a compiler for my coursework, and it&#x27;s all going fine but for some reason the div function is working differently inside the execute function? For example, -11 div 3 should give -4, and it does that everywhere except inside the provided execute function. But the execute function is pretty much calling that exactly, but gives -3 instead. Whats up with that? Is it shenanigans involving using Int instead of Integer?

 I created a template for AoC targeting beginners who want to jump straight to coding and don&#x27;t want to mess with cabal / stack / dependencies / exectuables ... It main features are:
  
A sensible set of “light” dependencies for AoC (It could be lighter though).
 A very simple bash command-line interface (CLI) which erase the usage of cabal: 
 Create Haskell executable files for each new Advent of Code day.
 Run solutions for each day with ease.
 Automatically manage Cabal files, reducing setup hassles.
 
 VSCode tasks for seamless interaction with the CLI. Press CTRL+Shift+P to open the command panel and type “run task” to see all available tasks.
  
It follows some different approaches than other templates. Mainly
  
each day is a single self-contained executable instead of modules
 you don&#x27;t have to touch cabal file If you don&#x27;t want to
 has built-in integration with VSCode, via tasks
 Has more dependencies
  
None of the above guarantees a better experience
 VSCode integration
 This is how vscode task look like:

                              <span>Hey, are there any tutorials, guides, or anything to help me build a simple type checker or a natural deduction solver in Haskell? That would be much appreciated! I’m primarily interested in the intersection between first order or propositional logic and functional programming.

 I want to automate something and am downloading content from a website, but in order to be able to download it, one has to &quot;sign-in&quot; via some of those above-mentioned, for the content to be generated and served.

                              <span>Hi,
 as nvim-user I am just starting out with orgmode and want to use emacs on 4 systems: 2 linux-boxes and 2 android-systems.
 The linux-boxes run emacs 29, on android (in a termux/proot environment) the emacs version currently is 27.
 I am using emacs only for orgmode with evil-mode and the modus-themes.
 What I want is to have the same environment on all machines and so this is my plan:
 I will use syncthing to sync all my org-files as well as the init.el between all machines and in the init.el I will only load packages with use-package.
 So the idea is that when I e.g. introduce a new package on one machine, the new config is synced to the other machines and when I start emacs there the package is installed automatically - everything stays in sync.
 My question: Would that work in practice or are there pitfalls I am not aware of?

 Warning (Emacs): elpaca version mismatch
 Note 2: I didnt install emacs from the debian repositories because they dont have the version 29.1 so I compile myself the source.

                              <span>Hi,
 every time I try to get into orgmode (which is great) I have to deal with emacs (I ususally use nvim) and I feel that regardless of any productivity boost orgmode may give me, I will never recover the time I have wasted with emacs configuration issues - it seems to be just a very, very fragile ecosystem...
 Here is the latest problem:
 I want to use the modus-operandi theme and have added a use-package clause copied from the documentation.
 But now when I open emacs I get a prompt, informing me that loading a theme can run lisp code and if I wanted to proceed, I say yes, I am asked if this theme should be deemed safe for future sessions, I say yes and then the theme loads fine - but only for this sesssion.
 When I close emacs the whole thing starts again, so my question is: How can I get rid of this annoying prompt?

                              <span>tl;dr I&#x27;m a noob using DooM and it seems I don&#x27;t understand variables
 Firstly; please forgive the gratuitous image of my RGB Steamdeck / Corne / DOOM Emacs &quot;coffee shop&quot; setup - I&#x27;m just enjoying it at the mo, and have a burning desire to share.
 After a quick play with Zone I&#x27;m trying to setup zone-matrix as my &quot;screensaver&quot;
 I did the following:
  
Pulled the files from zone-matrix githib to .emacs.d/zone/
 Added the following to my in my config.el. I realised I was comitting heresy for copying another person&#x27;s config (from a stackexchange answer) and braced myself for errors; 
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun tabbar-mode () (lambda (x) (message &quot;%s&quot;))) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path (concat dotfiles-dir &quot;zone&quot;)) (require &#x27;zone-matrix) (require &#x27;zone-matrix-settings) (require &#x27;zone-settings)
 (setq zone-programs [zone-matrix]) (zone-when-idle 60) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 After a doom sync I get an (to be honest expected) error void-variable dotfiles-dir.
 The issue I have is with the definition dotfiles-dir - I clearly don&#x27;t have that variable set, and wonder which of the following is the least-worst approach:
  
Because I&#x27;m on DooM there is probably already a similar variable set linking to .config/doom/ am I better putting the zone directory in there? If so, do I hard-code the path in the line containing dotfiles-dir?
 
Should I define a dotfiles-dir or zone-matrix-dir instead? I assume that flies in the face of dotfile conventions?
 
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts

                              <span>Is there a way to replace all hyperlinks in a buffer with some shorthand phrase say &quot;link&quot; while keeping them as clickable links to their respective site?
 I&#x27;ve been importing csv files as tables and one of the columns stores links but they&#x27;re quite long and making things awkward looking so I&#x27;d like to replace them with some shorthand.
 Sorry, probably a noob question, still new.

                              <span>There&#x27;s also a small wrapper for the GitHub CLI. I should call this a &quot;survival kit for corporate life&quot;. But since I&#x27;m not that creative, &quot;emacs-utils&quot; it is:
 https://git.sr.ht/~sebasmonia/emacs-utils
 Story below:
 I&#x27;ve had versions of a piece of code to pull info from JIRA, in private repos associated with different jobs, for years now.
 When I started my current gig I realized I should put that code in a public place, and maybe someone would write a &quot;proper&quot; JIRA package out of it. If anything, this lets you read details and comments (doesn&#x27;t do inline images nor attachments). I find it useful in its current state and maybe some of you will too. 
 And last weekend I wrote a Confluence reader. After being BEYOND ANNOYED that you can&#x27;t read pages without JS.I remember the old (and good) versions of Confluence that didn&#x27;t force the fancy editor down your throat and you could write everything in wiki markup...anyway.
 The reader detects when a link isn&#x27;t external, so it doesn&#x27;t send you to EWW. It doesn&#x27;t work in 100% of the cases, will probably revisit that code. 
 Oh and both JIRA and Confluence support Emacs&#x27; bookmarks, thank to EWW&#x27;s implementation and our beloved editor being open in the truest sense of the word.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve using emacs+notmuch to manage my emails. I use emacs via WSL2. I also use outlook.
 When I&#x27;m viewing an email in emacs, I sometimes want to be able to find it in outlook, maybe I want to reply using outlook or maybe it would look better in outlook.
 Previously I would copy the message-id of the email with emacs, then use a VBA function in outlook to find and open the same email in outlook, which works fine, but it&#x27;s a bit slow and convoluted.
 Then I found out recently instead of doing that, I could just copy the maildir file as an .eml file and use outlook to open it(here it is necessary to change the line ending to CRLF).
 Maybe I&#x27;m just stating the obvious here :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a Haskell course that has the following question.
 ​
  
Below you&#x27;ll find a type Result that works a bit like Maybe, but there are two different types of &quot;Nothings&quot;: one with and one without an error description. 
 Implement the instance Functor Result
  
data Result a &#x3D; MkResult a | NoResult | Failure String deriving (Show) 
 My solution:
 instance Functor Result where fmap f (MkResult x) &#x3D; MkResult (f x) fmap _ NoResult &#x3D; NoResult fmap _ (Failure desc) &#x3D; Failure desc 
 Notice that NoResult and Failure are both passthrough, but replacing those with fmap _ x &#x3D; x produces the following compilation error.
  • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘a’ with ‘b’ Expected: Result b Actual: Result a ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: fmap :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Result a -&gt; Result b at Set12.hs:57:3-6 ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: fmap :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Result a -&gt; Result b at Set12.hs:57:3-6 • In the expression: x In an equation for ‘fmap’: fmap _ x &#x3D; x In the instance declaration for ‘Functor Result’ • Relevant bindings include x :: Result a (bound at Set12.hs:58:10) fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Result a -&gt; Result b (bound at Set12.hs:57:3) | 58 | fmap _ x &#x3D; x | ^ 
 Is there a way to avoid the boilerplate pattern matching?

                              <span>I was just playing around with Haskell and there are a few things I couldn&#x27;t understand about the syntax rules of let and do blocks.
 Consider the following code:
 listings &#x3D; [x | i  20] -- [25,36,49,64,81,100] 
 I was thinking instead of using this sugar, why not use a do block, which is a more common sugar. So I came up with this, following this:
 listing &#x3D; do i  20) return x 
 I actually prefer removing the do sugar as well, like this:
 listing &#x3D; [0..10] &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (\i -&gt; let x &#x3D; i * i in guard (x &gt; 20) &gt;&gt; return x) 
 This got me thinking, can I use do so that I can avoid &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and &gt;&gt;, but also keep it a one liner. So I followed this, this and this and got the following to work:
 listing &#x3D; do {i  20); return x} 
 But I was hoping for something like this, which did not work:
 listing &#x3D; do {i  20); return x} 
 I am not really sure why. But I figured it might be because of let. I tried to get rid of it but I wasn&#x27;t able to, unless I just remove all sugar and have something like this:
 listing &#x3D; [0..10] &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (\i -&gt; (\x -&gt; guard (x &gt; 20) &gt;&gt; return x) (i * i)) 
 Which is, funnily enough, shorted then the do version. Long story short, I don&#x27;t understand the rules of do and let. Can someone explain in simple terms? By the way, is let also sugar, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it to me, because my lambda seems to make a dependency on the ordering of variables, but I&#x27;m not sure. I didn&#x27;t consider using where so I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s behavior.

 a. Bool
 b. Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool
 c. (Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool
 The answer is c, but I don&#x27;t understand why. Why not a?

 Does anyone know of a solution?

                              <span>Hi,
 I try to use org-modern together with org-indent and the modus-operandi theme.
 Tables seem to work fine when org-indent is off, but when I turn it on the &quot;beautified&quot; tables somehow acquire an extra empty row below every horizontal line.
 Is there anything I could try to make these two packages play nicely together?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I write to inform you about a session at the upcoming 22nd Annual CUNY IT Conference that might interest you. The &quot;Linking Your Thinking with ChatGPT&quot; session runs at 1 PM on Thursday, November 30th.
The session focuses on creating links between digital notes and articles, a practice relevant to us using or interested in Zettelkasten methods. A group of research assistants and Ph.D. students from the Electrical Engineering department at The City College of New York will lead the discussion, covering approaches to organizing and managing digital notes.
While the session announcement doesn&#x27;t explicitly mention &quot;Zettelkasten,&quot; it is my first opportunity to interact with Zettelkasten aficionados offline and--in case they aren&#x27;t aware of it--advertise the Zettelkasten.de site.
I plan to attend …</span>

                              <span>I recently started to use the bullet journal method and I&#x27;m on the way of ordering a beautiful hobonichi HON to track my week and add my appointments to the included calendar. However, there&#x27;s also always a blank page next to the daily page which also has space for notes or drawings.
I&#x27;d like to learn how to sketch with my fountain or ball pen as an attempt to stay away longer from lcd screens and have a time for reflection or just appreciation of life in general.
Thanks!</span>

                              <span>Some time ago I&#x27;ve read through a &quot;Programming in Scala&quot; book by Martin Odersky and Co, wanted to revisit it, but also to learn new Scala 3 syntax and features.
 The book was written for Scala 2, so it can be cumbersome to translate it page by page to a newer syntax, and I wanted to ask:
 Is there any book that gives you introduction to up-to-date language features as much as giving you full overview of language as in &quot;Programming in Scala&quot;?

                              <span>I have a few newbie questions about theme customisation. In the doom-one-theme.el file, all of the colour definitions have 3 arguments, commented as being &quot;default&quot;, &quot;256&quot;, and &quot;16&quot;.
  ;; name default 256 16 ((bg &#x27;(&quot;#282c34&quot; &quot;black&quot; &quot;black&quot; )) (fg &#x27;(&quot;#bbc2cf&quot; &quot;#bfbfbf&quot; &quot;brightwhite&quot; )) 
 My best guess is that these refer to colour depths, but I&#x27;m feeling a bit out of my depth here (hah!). My questions are as follows:
  
How does Emacs decide which colour/depth to use?
 Are these fields all required, or are they customary/nice to have?
 Why are some colours hexes and others strings? Do the strings refer to some table somewhere with more hexes?
  
I would be extremely grateful for any clarity and/or links to relevant documentation where I can learn more!
 Thanks

                              <span>I recently picked up a new project that uses React. Out of the box, my configuration doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing very well -- indentation is erratic (sometimes thrown off by JSX), no lsp-rename, and generally things are slow.
 Are there any generally recommended approaches for React development with Emacs? Language server, minor modes, tree-sitter, etc? There seem to be a lot of options and modes available.
 The codebase is currently JavaScript and JSX, but I&#x27;m considering Typescript and TSX down the line. Should I just default to the TypeScript tooling?

                              <span>Hi guys, sometimes I try something new to compare with already used packages, this weekend I wanted to try Eglot, however, I ran into a number of problems. One of them is autocomplete.
 For example, when I write in vue, I want to autocomplete a watch function. This function is available in the following packages
 import { watch } from &#x27;vue&#x27;; import { watch } from &#x27;fs&#x27;; import { watch } from &#x27;fs/promises&#x27; ... etc 
 But when I use autocomplete in eglot I only see the first candidate - importing from the fs package. Is there any possibility or workaround to display all possible candidates?
 Example of autocomplete with eglot

 Example of autocomplete with lsp-mode

 ​
 I also know that lsp-mode in conjunction with corfu has a similar problem, but it is impossible to solve it there as the authors of both packages think that the problem is not on their side 😅 Is the situation with eglot the same?

At first, I thought I could just fiddle with text-scale-set and the hooks in mu4e-headers-mode-hook, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the header-line. I&#x27;ve tried also doing a face-remap for the header-line, but when I do it that way I can&#x27;t then adjust the font size further. Any advice?

 This Doom Emacs install is on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, and I have also tried Ubuntu 23.10.1 (Mantic Minotaur) and still the same error.
 This is my org-roam configuration:
 (use-package! org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory &quot;~/RoamNotes&quot;) (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-dailies-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; entry &quot;* %: %?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;%.org&quot; &quot;#+title: %\n&quot;)))) :bind ((&quot;C-c n l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c n f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c n i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert) :map org-mode-map (&quot;C-M-i&quot; . completion-at-point) :map org-roam-dailies-map (&quot;Y&quot; . org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday) (&quot;T&quot; . org-roam-dailies-capture-tomorrow)) :bind-keymap (&quot;C-c n d&quot; . org-roam-dailies-map) :config (require &#x27;org-roam-dailies) ;; Ensure the keymap is available (org-roam-db-autosync-mode)) 
 This is the backtrace of the error:
  set-buffer(#) (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal &#x27;(4))) (closure ((buf . #)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal &#x27;(4))))() apply((closure ((buf . #)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal &#x27;(4)))) nil) timer-event-handler([t 25958 838 237811 nil (closure ((buf . #)) nil (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (org-reveal &#x27;(4)))) nil nil 85000 nil]) 
 I have tried the following:
  
Delete the org-roam-db and then run org-roam-db-sync.
 Going into emacsql directory &gt;&gt; sqlite and running make.
  
Thank you all in advance.

                              <span>For example, let&#x27;s say I were to change backward-delete-char-untabify-method for prog-mode buffers. Naively, I&#x27;d write something like,
 (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method &#x27;hungry))) 
 but the documentation recommends against using lambdas in add-hook calls (which makes sense). I can, of course, just make a named function instead of a lambda and pass that to add-hooks. But, rather than do that, is there any other option for setting variables automatically for modes besides a hook like this?
 Also, as a bonus question, if I wanted to also do something like enable show-paren-mode for all prog-mode buffers, which of the following do you consider &quot;better&quot; (assume that this is not something that is likely to change frequently):
 ;; option 1 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method &#x27;hungry)) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;my-prog-mode-settings) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;show-paren-mode) ;; option 2 (defun my-prog-mode-settings () (setq-local backward-delete-char-untabify-method &#x27;hungry) (show-paren-mode)) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;my-prog-mode-settings) 
 Obviously, I realize that it&#x27;s not really important, but I feel like bike-shedding this morning.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a &quot;Neovim Refugee&quot; trying to get a deeper/better understanding of how emacs lisp works and how i can use it to expand on my emacs setup. I have never done anything in lisp before and still struggle to understand how single quotes signify a function or what ever.
 With that said, i was also planning on doing AoC this year. Originally i wanted to look into zig or go, but now think that this might be the opportunity to dive into lisp for a bit.
 But with knowing basically nothing: Is this even &quot;viable&quot;, or advisable? Should i be looking at common lisp instead? Or would you say that&#x27;s a pretty dumb idea and i should rather learn it in a different way?

                              <span>Made this handy little function I use when edition html templates (Django templating, Jinja2). Haven&#x27;t tested it in other templating engines b/c I don&#x27;t use them. Requires &#x60;projectile&#x60; and &#x60;x-ref&#x60;. Hope someone else finds this useful. I bind it to &#x60;M-.&#x60; and use &#x60;M-,&#x60; to go back (features from &#x60;x-ref&#x60;)
 (defun gopar/html-jump-to-template-def () &quot;When in web-mode, we can use this function to jump to template definition if thing at point looks like a filename&quot; (interactive) (require &#x27;cl-lib) (let (path string-at-point) (setq string-at-point (thing-at-point &#x27;filename t)) (setq path (cl-find-if (lambda (x) (string-match-p string-at-point x)) (projectile-project-files (projectile-project-root)))) (if path (progn (xref--push-markers) (find-file (format &quot;%s%s&quot; (projectile-project-root) path))) (message &quot;No Template File Found&quot;)))) 
 usage:
 {% extends &quot;layouts/single_column_layout.html&quot; %} # Doing M-. on template path will jump to that template {% block main_content %} 
 {% if not invoices %} # Will also jump here {% include &quot;components/invoices/tabs/invoices-empty.html&quot; %} {% else %} # And here {% include &quot;components/invoices/tabs/invoices-list.html&quot; %} {% endif %} 
 {% endblock %} 
 Mainly sharing cause its been a while since i&#x27;ve touched elisp, and was glad I was still able to make something (Small but something regardless). Also if there&#x27;s a package that does this already, please share. thanks

 Here&#x27;s what it does:
  
Selects the current paragraph in Emacs.
 Sends it to ChatGPT for a grammar and spelling check.
 Replaces the original text with the corrected version, all within Emacs.

 The other night I read a post on X that said LLMs would be used to enhance word prediction for texting on phones. I thought another interesting application would be to easily bring spelling and grammar fixes to whatever I&#x27;m editing in emacs.
 It&#x27;s not flawless, but in my experience, it&#x27;s all I need.

                              <span>Hey all,
 at my alma mater we are holding a course on Haskell for the students, and one of the initiatives as part of that course is that students can optionally participate in solving Advent Of Code in Haskell, where they can discuss on our Discord how they solved the tasks, ask for help, and learn together, with other students but also with us teachers. It is a way to get them a bit more excited about Haskell and give them a taste of how Haskell fares on a competition like this.
 In order to make it easier for them to get going with it, and to save them from pitfalls of setting up a project in Cabal, I created this template github repo: https://github.com/Martinsos/aoc-2023-haskell-template .
 I am sharing it here in case anybody has some feedback on how it can be improved, and maybe it also helps somebody else here to get started with AoC in Haskell!
 Regarding improvement advice: keep in mind that we want to keep it simple for relative newcomers to Haskell (so no Nix :D!).

                              <span>Had a couple of questions while exploring cabal,
  
What is the difference between cabal install 
 vs adding package name to .cabal and then cabal run/build?
 Where are cabal package dependencies for a project installed (after cabal init)? Couldn&#x27;t find them in the current directory. I read it can be found in ~/.cabal/packages, but then if they are installed in a common location, how does it manage versions across them? Does it install for every version and use as required for a project? Why not a node-modules like structure?
 Does cabal install behave differently depending on whether .cabal is present in the current directory or not?
 What if after adding a package .cabal, I decided to change my mind and remove it. In the next cabal run/build, will the package be uninstalled from wherever it was stored?
  
Thanks.

                              <span>I have a program that processes a string and returns a special result. I would like ask the user for input and show the results.
 The ways I&#x27;ve found:
  
Console. An easy way, I&#x27;ve implemented it, but it&#x27;s too simple. I want graphics.
 
GUI app. Yes, that&#x27;s what I need. But, I find writing GUIs in Haskell very boring. Also, the user should download and launch an application, which I don&#x27;t really like
 
 Web-based ways:
  
Web server and application in Haskell. Yes! There are frameworks. But I need a free hosting for Haskell applications. Which, currently, I haven&#x27;t found.
 
(Haskell code -&gt; JS library) + NodeJS. Perfect. I have no problem that the computation is performed at user side. Currently exploring this way. (And I can&#x27;t use PureScript)
 
 What are your thoughts?

I’ve developed a new library to filter local files in Nix
which I’d like to introduce!
This post requires some familiarity with Nix and its language.
So if you don’t know what Nix is yet,
take a look first,
it’s pretty neat.
In this post we’re going to look at what source filtering is,
why it’s useful,
why a new library was needed for it,
and the basics of the new library.
This post notably won’t really teach you a lot about the new library,
that’s what the official tutorial
and the reference documentation is for.
But if you’d like to know some background and motivation, please read on!

Why filter sources
You most likely have come across this pattern:
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  src &#x3D; ./.;
  # stuff..

                              <span>Hey there,
 So I know if emacs is lagging I should run the profiler for a bit while it&#x27;s lagging and then review the report. However, I&#x27;m not sure what to do next. 
 It looks clear that company / completion is responsible for the laggy behavior here, especially a jsonrpc-request made by completion. That makes sense, there&#x27;s a slow network call somewhere in the works that&#x27;s gumming things up.
 I&#x27;m using eglot for lsp and would expect that would be the source of a slow jsonrpc call, maybe eglot trying to get completion candidates on every keystroke through the LSP server? But I don&#x27;t understand the stack here well enough to know how to proceed in debugging or fixing things.
 Would love any help. Knowing what to fix is great - but also I&#x27;m really interested in knowing how to know what to do next in general in this scenario.
 Thanks!

 I find accessing Terraform provider documentation on the web to be a little cumbersome, and have often wished for a plain text experience similar to info manuals instead. 
 I recently decided to Google possible solutions, only to discover that /u/txgvnn had already written a package for it. 
 Thanks! I think it&#x27;s awesome! 🙂

 that can be modified by writing Emacs Lisp code (and CSS too),
 with &quot;html templates&quot; that are plain Emacs Lisp data,

 and no dependencies on external static site generators?
  
If so, you might be interested in one.el a simple Static Site Generator for Emacs Lisp programmers and org-mode users.

                              <span>Hi, basically it is working well but I want to remove repetitive msg when evaluated to REPL. 
 for instance, when below code
 nums &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] def double(x): return x * 2 list(map(double, nums)) 
 is evaluated by C-c C-c
 &gt;&gt;&gt; __PYTHON_EL_eval(&quot;nums &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndef double(x): return x * 2\nlist(map(double, nums))&quot;, &quot;/Users/darren/Work/ace/pyth/codi/01-iterations/binary-gap.py&quot;) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] 
 Can I remove this msg?
 __PYTHON_EL_eval(&quot;nums &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ndef double(x): return x * 2\nlist(map(double, nums))&quot;, &quot;/Users/darren/Work/ace/pyth/codi/01-iterations/binary-gap.py&quot;) 
 So it just shows like
 &gt;&gt;&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>For my hobby desktop c/c++ projects I started using emacs, and I really like it. I made my own config, which contains only a couple of packages like vertico, lsp-mode, company etc.
 Professionally I am an embedded systems consultant, working with lot of different uC-s and IDE-s. I have a bigger job currently where I have to work with PIC32 uC, and the project is created with MPLAB X IDE. I wanted use emacs and lsp-mode, but it seems that clangd could not find some of the headers. I have generated the compile_commands.json with a python script called compiledb, but it is not working properly.... maybe clangd can not understand some of the compile flags from xc32-cc ? (the mplab compiler).
 Anyone tried this stuff? Thx for help.

 I have no idea what combination of keys I&#x27;ve hit to effect this change, but it does not happen on start-up. 
 Viewing lossage is not much help because quite a lot of time may have passed and my need to type &quot;C&quot;. (I am not Carl Carlson Chairman of the Classic Car Confabulation Committee. )
 Does anyone have any ideas how even to debug this? I am flummoxed.
 Many thanks!!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for my personal notes/wiki and have quite a few files across a handful of folders. They keep on growing.
 Scenario:
 I&#x27;m sitting in dired and want to rename a file. How does one do that again...? I know I&#x27;ve made notes on this before, but I can&#x27;t remember which file in which folder. I remember I tagged it with :dired:, though.
 What would be the fastest way to search for this? Is there a way to do a search like rename tag&#x3D;dired, or similar, in a folder w/subfolders, across all my org-mode notes?
 I should also mention that I really don&#x27;t want to install any extra packages for this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m puzzled. Whenever I do a package-refresh-contents or whenever I try to launch mastodon.el (M-x mastodon) my #emacs hangs. package-refresh-contents only shows &#x27;Contacting host: elpa.gnu.org:443&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t do much more. I have to ctlr-g to break out or wait a couple of minutes before emacs says that the package refresh is done. mastodon.el is a different beast. After a wait I get &#x27;Wrong type argument: stringp, nil&#x27;.
 Thing is, this does not happen when I&#x27;m on the vpn for work!
 My two other computers at home experience the exact same issue. These two don&#x27;t have any vpn software installed, just plain debian. The computer with the vpn is a Windows 10 with WSL2 running debian as well. I use cntlm when on the vpn and I set my proxy accordingly. On my plain debian home boxes I don&#x27;t use any proxy. I use the same .emacs file on all three machines.
 Was it a debian apt-get update that did this to me? I have no idea. Anyone here with a similar issue?

                              <span>Hi all, I thought I was being very clever by creating a virtual machine build environment so I didn&#x27;t have to litter my main computer with 100s of packages to build emacs. So I built it in a gnomebox and set the prefix to $home/.local/opt/emacs as I saw someone do. It runs fine in the virtual machine
 The issue is now, I&#x27;d like to move the install or the built files to my host machine and run it, but it won&#x27;t run. If I just try to move the $home/.local/opt/emacs folder to my own computer, and run it I get the following:
 ./emacs-29.1.90: error while loading shared libraries: libgpm.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 When I try to move the whole directory (source code and the build directories inside there) out of the virtual machine into the Host and try to run make install (this is after make and compilation completed) it says 
 make install if [ -x ./config.status ]; then \ ./config.status --recheck; \ else \ ../configure --cache-file&#x3D;/dev/null; \ fi /bin/sh: line 4: ../configure: Permission denied make: *** [Makefile:573: config.status] Error 126 
 I have tried to chown -R : ./ to the whole directory but it still gives me the permission denied.
 Any ideas how I might accomplish this task?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all! :)
 Im quite new so please excuse my ignorance.Im currently running doom emacs, and REALLY love it, but i have a few problems which im trying to tackle one at a time.
 The current problem i have is that when i mark a TODO as &quot;DONE&quot;, it still shows up in org agenda weekly schedule view. I did some googling, and have currently tried this:
 (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (setq org-agenda-skip-function-global &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;todo &#x27;done)) 
 None of these options have helped me so far :/
 Worth to point out is that Im using custom labels in doom emacs, so ill paste them here as well, just to double check that the issue isnt there:
  (setq org-todo-keywords ; This overwrites the default Doom org-todo-keywords &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; ; A task that is ready to be tackled &quot;ASMT(a)&quot; ; Assignment &quot;EXAM(e)&quot; ; Exam &quot;PRESNT(p)&quot; ; Presentation &quot;MAIL(m)&quot; ; Mail &quot;MEET(M)&quot; ; Meeting &quot;IDEA(i)&quot; ; Ideas to be done &quot;PROJ(P)&quot; ; A project that contains other tasks &quot;CHORES(c)&quot; ; Chores that needs to be done &quot;LEISURE(l)&quot; ; Leisure / Hobby stuff &quot;APPOINTMENT(A)&quot; ; Scheduled appointments &quot;REMINDER(r)&quot; ; Reminder &quot;WAIT(w)&quot; ; Something is holding up this task &quot;|(k)&quot; ; The pipe necessary to separate &quot;active&quot; states and &quot;inactive&quot; states &quot;DONE(d)&quot; ; Task has been completed &quot;CANCELLED(c)&quot; ) ; Task has been cancelled (sequence &quot;[ ](T)&quot; &quot;[-](S)&quot; &quot;[?](W)&quot; &quot;[X](D)&quot; ) (sequence &quot;OKAY(o)&quot; &quot;YES(y)&quot; &quot;NO(n)&quot; )) org-todo-keyword-faces &#x27;( (&quot;TODO&quot; . &quot;plum&quot;) (&quot;IDEA&quot; . &quot;CadetBlue1&quot;) (&quot;PROJ&quot; . &quot;gray&quot;) (&quot;ASMT&quot; . &quot;cyan1&quot;) (&quot;EXAM&quot; . &quot;tan1&quot;) (&quot;PRESNT&quot; . &quot;bisque&quot;) (&quot;MAIL&quot; . &quot;orchid&quot;) (&quot;MEET&quot; . &quot;thistle3&quot;) (&quot;CHORES&quot; . &quot;gold1&quot;) (&quot;LEISURE&quot; . &quot;PowderBlue&quot;) (&quot;APPOINTMENT&quot; . &quot;pink&quot;) (&quot;REMINDER&quot; . &quot;tomato&quot;) (&quot;WAIT&quot; . &quot;orange&quot;) (&quot;DONE&quot; . &quot;PaleGreen&quot;) (&quot;CANCELLED&quot; . &quot;salmon&quot;) (&quot;[ ]&quot; . &quot;PaleGreen&quot;) (&quot;[-]&quot; . &quot;orange&quot;) (&quot;[?]&quot; . &quot;khaki&quot;) (&quot;[X]&quot; . &quot;gray&quot;) (&quot;OKAY&quot; . &quot;gray&quot;) (&quot;YES&quot; . &quot;gray&quot;) (&quot;NO&quot; . &quot;salmon&quot;))))

Does anyone have a trick or a package that you use to remove the visible #+Begin and #+END markup and maybe add italics and even a left-side bar to the quote as an alternative visual cue? Though I live in Emacs, sometimes I miss the kind of simplicity that a web-based editor or a messenger like Slack could provide. Thank you!

                              <span>web-view is a library for type-safe HTML and CSS with intuitive layouts and composable styles. This is an idea I&#x27;ve been experimenting with for a few years, and I&#x27;m happy to finally release it! I&#x27;ve used this approach on multiple professional projects, and it is currently being used at the National Solar Observatory. It combines the best ideas of Tailwindcss and Elm-UI with Haskell.

 myPage &#x3D; col (gap 10) $ do el (bold . fontSize 32) &quot;My page&quot; button (border 1) &quot;Click Me&quot; 
 Instead of relying on CSS&#x27;s poor programming features, we can use normal Haskell functions to factor and reuse our app&#x27;s styles
 header &#x3D; bold h1 &#x3D; header . fontSize 32 h2 &#x3D; header . fontSize 24 page &#x3D; gap 10 myPage &#x3D; col page $ do el h1 &quot;My Page&quot; ... 
 It has more features, including
  
Intuitive Layouts with &#x60;row&#x60;, &#x60;col&#x60;, &#x60;grow&#x60; and &#x60;space&#x60;
 Embedded page-specific CSS
 Stateful styles (like hover) and responsive designs
  
Any and all questions or feedback welcome! The reasoning behind using utility classes for CSS is explained well here. Also, stay tuned in the coming weeks for the upcoming release of Hyperbole, a server-only interactive web-framework that leverages this library.

 http://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_functions
 I see this as problematic, because whether a function is partial is mostly a question of type. But to ensure valid values for a specific type, for example all numbers from zero to 2^16 - 1 (unsigned 16-bit integer) or &quot;Natural&quot; as a subset of Haskell&#x27;s &quot;Integer&quot;, you need a smart constructor that produces an error message for incorrect number arguments; a function that behaves partially relative to the values of an original type such as &quot;Integer&quot;. Would it be practical here to always work with an optional type, Haskell&#x27;s &quot;Maybe&quot;? I don&#x27;t think so! Because that would result in almost all types being &quot;maybe&quot; and the code be littered with unnecessary pattern matching.

                              <span>This is the first of a series of blogs/tutorials I am writing on using scala to perform machine learning inference. Nvidia Triton is a highly configurable server for deploying models. In this post I only use a small vision classification model, but it has the ability to deploy pretty much any architecture including LLMs. I am still learning scala/FP and would love some feedback.

 Please take a minute to share your opinion (using the poll link above) on how semiauto derivation of circe Decoders and Encoders should work in Scala 3, i.e. when you call any of these methods explicitly:
 Decoder.derived[Foo] Decoder.derivedConfigured[Foo] Encoder.AsObject.derived[Foo] Encoder.AsObject.derivedConfigured[Foo]

 We have also taken advantage to improve ergonomics and clarify some concepts. 
 We use endless in prod to run event-sourced functional apps on top of Pekko or Akka (and we are working on a cats-effect native runtime).

 &quot;stack ghci .\Factors.hs&quot; can correctly load it.
 I install package by: stack install parallel
 It is so confusing, I configure the dev environment for hours, still not working.
 I uninstall and install GHCup already, I have no idea how to install Haskell and parallel package correctly.
 my WSL ubuntu is also broken, by removing stack.yaml will make the error disappear but still has the same problem that cannot recongnize parallel package.

 Now, I want to setup a correct dev environment.
 Looks like vscode or hsl extension don&#x27;t knokw the stack package.
 How to make stack package can be found by vscode.

                              <span>I recently had a situation where I wanted all maximal elements of a list. Base has maximum but that just gives a single element. A maximal function that gives all maximal elements would be a straight forward generalization with the added benefit that it’s defined for the empty list. Then one could just have
 maximum &#x3D; head . maximal 
 On Hoogle I couldn’t find something like this. Neither in base nor any package. 
 Very often when I think &quot;why is this not in base?&quot; it turns out that there actually is something and what I wanted is just a special case. Or you can trivially compose it out of other functions. Does this apply here?
 I also noticed, when I tried to define maximal for Foldable instead of lists, I did not know how to do it without specializing the return type (ie list). Is that possible? And if not, is that maybe the problem why it’s not in base?

 Capture text from Safari into your inbox.
 https://github.com/mmagnus/orgmode-capture-all
 A simple hack to right click on selected text and capture it (with URL if this is Safari) to your OrgMode Inbox.
 I hope someone else will find this useful.
 This works pretty much in all apps on macOS (e.g. Mail)
 The hack is composed of workflow for Automator and a small Python script (that might need some adjustment for your case)

                              <span>Hi,
 could someone please explain how to get org-caldav to work with a radicale-server as I don&#x27;t know what I am doing wrong...
 Or maybe give an org-mode noob a tip on how to debug such issues as I have tried and given up on orgmode several times in the past.
 So I have a radicale server that works with my android-clients and I am trying to sync with org using this in my init.el:
  (use-package org-caldav :ensure t :config (progn (setq org-caldav-url &quot;http://10.10.10.100:5232&quot;) (setq org-caldav-calendar-id &quot;mh&quot;) (setq org-caldav-inbox &quot;/home/mh/test/calendar/cal.org&quot;)) ) 
 But when I then run org-caldav sync I am prompted for username and password and the eventual message &quot;CalDAV sync finished. Nothing was done&quot;.
 So how do I get this to work?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to collaborate around a Laminar implementation of Material UI 5 using Scala.JS. I think this combination would make a compelling platform for Scala developers to create beautiful websites quickly and easily with the full power of Scala at hand.
 The roadblocks to this plan seem to be:
  
ScalablyTyped/Converter doesn&#x27;t (yet) support the generation of Laminar Web Components, but only React and Slinky. The path of least resistance is to augment this tool to generate Laminar Web Components, too, but I have no clue how to do that (yet), or even if this is the optimal path.
 I&#x27;m fairly new to this ecosystem, so I&#x27;m looking for pointers, effort estimates, existing implementations, help, ideas, etc. before I launch in this direction. I&#x27;m surprised this doesn&#x27;t exist already because, to me, it is a winning combination! path.

 Existing things I&#x27;ve researched but I&#x27;m not interested in (so please don&#x27;t bother suggesting them):
  
Things like the incomplete and archived Laminar Web Components because it is unmaintained, outdated, and based on a complicated generator that is only known to work on Material UI 3
 The st-material-ui repository because it only generates for ReactJS or Slinky right now, although the approach used by this library is nearly exactly what I want if it only supported Laminar Web Components
  
Thanks in advance for any thoughts you may have.

 Attempting to use slime on a fresh install gives the error:

 wth is this? ):
 Edit:
 Ubuntu 23.10.
 Emacs 29.1
 Journey so far: M-x package-list-packages  -&gt; found slime -&gt; clicked install.
 M-x slime-mode -&gt; got error.

                              <span>Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts,
 I&#x27;m reaching out to see if there&#x27;s anyone here who&#x27;s successfully integrated a modern development environment within Emacs for Python programming. Specifically, I&#x27;m interested in a setup that incorporates eglot, tree-sitter and company.
 I&#x27;ve encountered a significant issue: whenever I enable python-ts-mode, Emacs consumes all my system&#x27;s memory and crashes. While I&#x27;ve managed to use a more basic setup that limits tree-sitter to syntax highlighting only, I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that I&#x27;m missing out on some great functionality.
 To help with investigation:
  
I am running on a Mac
 The bare minimum to reproduce this problem is on the following gist: https://gist.github.com/hnarayanan/a6397d6723fce19e2802d4305071e611
 I happen to use Emacs from MacPorts, but to double-check, I also attempted to download it from https://emacsformacosx.com and it crashed in the same way
 This seems to happen independent of the language server used in the backend. I intend on using python-lsp-server, but it fails even if I don&#x27;t have it installed.
  
Has anyone faced a similar problem and found a solution? Perhaps I am doing something very wrong with my config? I&#x27;m eager to learn from your experiences and would greatly appreciate any advice or tips you can offer.
 Thank you!
 ⚠️Edit⚠️
 This appears to be something inherently broken with tree-sitter as installed by MacPorts (or the particular language grammar for Python). I decided to dig into this and built both tree-sitter and Emacs from scratch, and they work really well together without my memory problems.

                              <span>When I do: M-x comment-line or C-x C-;
 It puts a space after comment marks, i.e, the line, that I want to comment:
 some line
 It does this:
 // some line
 I use a different style of coding, i.e. I don&#x27;t like to put spaces between the comment mark and the comment line.
 In customize, I&#x27;ve searched for all the places, where it could be configured and set 0 for spaces after comment mark and removed the space from the field, that said, that it is responsible for putting spaces after the comment mark, but it didn&#x27;t help. The space still appends and I have to manually remove it.
 Can you help me to set it up correctly.
 I am new to Emacs and still trying to figure it out.

                              <span>Calc&#x27;c elisp functions (imho) all have the prefix calcFunc-. So in order to use a calc function like vlen in an org table lisp formula, one could use calcFunc-vlen. That&#x27;s nice.
 What bothers me is the lack of &quot;on-line&quot; documentation (i.e. usable with eldoc or completion frameworks).
 All calc functions are nicely documented here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html , thats good.
 It is possible to modify a elisp&#x27;s function documentation. e.g. like so:
 (put &#x27;calcFunc-vlen &#x27;function-documentation &quot;Computes the length of a vector. The length of a non-vector is considered to be zero. Note that matrices are just vectors of vectors for the purposes of this command.&quot;) 
 Now calcFunc-vlen would have a nice &quot;on-line&quot; documentation, usable with C-h f, autocompletion and eldoc.
 Has anyone already bothered to gather some of those strings from the manual, in a more machine processable form? So I could save some work to create &quot;on-line&quot; documentation of the calc functions?
 Edit: following screenshots are intended to make it clear, what I want it for:
 company completion and echo help
 ivy ivy-rich and function docstrings

 I am using native Emacs build for Android.
 Is there a way to send notification from my Emacs app to Android using some package?
 Has anyone found a way or a workaround?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new in Haskell. Currently I&#x27;m working on a &quot;SQL&quot; project and I got stuck on deserializing JSON file contents. This is how the file looks like:
 {
 &quot;Table&quot;:&quot;flags&quot;,
 &quot;Columns&quot;:[
 {&quot;Name&quot;:&quot;flag&quot;, &quot;ColumnType&quot;:&quot;StringType&quot;},
 {&quot;Name&quot;:&quot;value&quot;, &quot;ColumnType&quot;:&quot;BoolType&quot;}],
 &quot;Rows&quot;:[
 [{&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;StringValue a&quot;}, {&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;BoolValue True&quot;}],
 [{&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;StringValue b&quot;}, {&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;BoolValue True&quot;}],
 [{&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;StringValue b&quot;}, {&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;NullValue&quot;}],
 [{&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;StringValue b&quot;}, {&quot;Value&quot;:&quot;BoolValue False&quot;}]
 ]
 }
 And this is what I&#x27;ve been working with:
 data FromJSONColumn &#x3D; FromJSONColumn {
 deserializedName :: String,
 deserializedDataType :: String
 } deriving (Show, Eq, Generic)
 ​
 instance FromJSON FromJSONColumn where
 parseJSON (Object v) &#x3D;
 FromJSONColumn  v .: &quot;Name&quot;
  v .: &quot;ColumnType&quot;
 parseJSON _ &#x3D; mzero 
 And I don&#x27;t understand why I&#x27;m always getting this error: 
 https://preview.redd.it/b5mrhhkc4k2c1.png?width&#x3D;864&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;82aa3a6fa320aa66251830e84b6e9cd76932e991
 Could somebody explain how to write instances for such files (files that contain tables) ? How should I do it? I&#x27;m truly lost.
 P.S. This is the DataFrame I&#x27;m working with: 
 data ColumnType
 &#x3D; IntegerType
 | StringType
 | BoolType
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 data Column &#x3D; Column String ColumnType
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 data Value
 &#x3D; IntegerValue Integer
 | StringValue String
 | BoolValue Bool
 | NullValue
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 type Row &#x3D; [Value]
 data DataFrame &#x3D; DataFrame [Column] [Row]
 deriving (Show, Eq)

 Thanks to work of u/angerman we now can compile mobile apps for iOS and Android with 9.6.3, but iPhone 7 (and earlier) and Android 10 are not supported yet with this build, so it uses GHC 8.10.7 for mobile apps and 9.6.3 in desktop apps.
 Some observation about 9.6.3 on mobile: it seems to have reduced overall CPU usage, but made apps much less responsive. Surprisingly, it was resolved by moving hs_init call to background thread - nothing in the docs suggested that it would made any difference, but it made the apps much more responsive on iOS (yet to test on Android).
 Does anybody know why it could have happened?
 We now use these RTS options that also help responsiveness and reduce memory usage by 10% (when the usage was large): - -A16m (chunk size for new allocations) - -H64m (initial heap size) - -xn (non-moving GC)
 Let me know if you have any comments on these!
 Thank you!

 ( [x | x  173 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 300, x &#x60;mod&#x60; 3 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0] :: [Integer] ) 
 Problem is this infinite list version goes crazy because it&#x27;s not being overruled. Is there a way to, e.g., take just the numbers in the following range clause?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m learning Haskell by writing a client library for NATS (nats.io). I&#x27;ve come to a point where I need to use UUIDs, and the examples I&#x27;ve come across online rely on running the &#x27;app&#x27; in a monad that provides the UUIDs. 
 Given that I&#x27;m writing a library, when interacting with this library as a consumer would you expect to interact with it in the context of a monad, or is there some pattern that avoids this?
 Edit: the example mentioned above is shown here https://stackoverflow.com/a/58908135

                              <span>Other than EMURGO Academy, are there any instructor led Haskell courses/bootcamps? I’m on a waitlisting for a cohort in January and I’ve got a feeling I’m not gonna make it. So in the likely event I’m forced to wait until spring, does anyone know any alternatives?

 Since 3.3.1 (September 7th) that appears to have stopped. Anyone know what&#x27;s changed, or is this just a temporary delay?

                              <span>Recently, I started to sense that I was really struggling with using my Zettelkasten. For whatever reason, feeling some order in the midst to the chaos, seemed out of my grasp without spending a lot of time figuring things out. So, I thought to myself, &quot;What if I just started over, and tried out folgezettel even though I think @Sascha has convinced me it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary?&quot;
Well, I have to report early that, while I feel like someone that should be able to workout without the need for a personal trainer, I like the personal trainer... a lot.
I don&#x27;t know what it is! But, there is something about the id&#x27;s and just needing to loosely relate one to the next one that helps to create focus and clarity.
I&#x27;m sorry for this moment, leaving: 20231125055521 -- At least for now. Maybe one day, I&#x27;ll be able to exercise without a personal trainer. But, today, I&#x27;m just happy I&#x27;m working out.</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I am not sure if many people are using alerts for the appointments, I do, I like the behavior where it brings Emacs to the front and shows a message in the mini buffer. However, when I am quickly writing in another application I sometimes end up writing in the active buffer. I am contemplating creating a function which puts the buffer in read only mode before showing switching to Emacs, if it was not already Read Only, and restores it when the reminder disappears. That should be enough to avoid accidental writing.
 Before I embark in that task I would like to know if anybody has done anything like that, or any other creative ideas to avoid contaminating the current buffer.
 Thanks!

 I open files over tramp and use a remote login machine to do that. Said login machine is shared by many people and thus I can’t run a language server on it. I’d like to use eglot but don’t want to run the language server on it. 
 I’ve been trying to either run the language server on a computer machine (another remote one) or on my local Mac (Mac would be preferable). 
 Has anyone managed to point a language server running on a local Mac to files over ssh?

 hi all,
 I installed emacs using
  
brew install --cask emacs
  
when I launch Emacs from the terminal with
  
emacs
  
None of the keystrokes respond in emacs and all show up in the terminal window.
 I&#x27;m running:
  
Macbook pro m3 max
 Sonoma 14.1 (23B2073)
  
Never had this problem when emacs was previously installed on my macs. Any ideas on what the issue might be?
 thank you

                              <span>Hi!
 Lennart gave a presentation about combinators and graph reduction at the FP seminars at Chalmers a few months ago. He wrote a little implementation to demo at the talk, and just never stopped writing code. Today he came back and gave a presentation about MicroHaskell. It is an &quot;extended subset&quot; of Haskell, which is compiled to combinators and evaluated via graph reduction, implemented by a runtime-system written in 2500 lines of C.
 Here is a recording of the presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Zk5SJ79nOnA
 Here is his repo: https://github.com/augustss/MicroHs
 I hope some of you find it as interesting as we did :)

                              <span>I really enjoy using Kafka, and in my company we currently use it as the central piece of our event-driven architecture. We are a Node and Python shop. 
 Given Kafka is written in Scala and Java, are we missing anything by not using Scala (or even JVM-based) clients?

                              <span>The Commit Mono font has a feature that it calls &quot;smart kerning&quot;. Monaspace has a similar feature that it calls &quot;texture healing.&quot; Characters are moved around slightly, or swapped out for a slightly larger or smaller character to even out the spacing, for example, when a wide character like an &#x27;m&#x27; is followed by a narrow character like an &#x27;l&#x27;. 
 The effect looks nice on their web sites. It worked in VSCode, but not in Emacs. The &quot;smart kerning&quot; / &quot;texture healing&quot; features did not seem to be activated when I tried the fonts in Emacs. 
 How would I get this to work in Emacs? The Monaspace docs say you have to add &quot;&#x27;calt&#x27;&quot; to &quot;editor.ligatures&quot; in the VSCode Settings. Commit Mono just worked without changing the settings.
 I might end up hating the moving around, but I&#x27;d have to try it for a few hours to see. I&#x27;m just not sure how to set that up in Emacs, or if Emacs supports that sort of thing.

 I don&#x27;t think this makes sense, obviously the encrypted file would have bad UTF-8 characters but why would Emacs complain about this? This file is an org-mode file that was encrypted with GPG. The warning pops up reliably a few seconds after I save, and sporadically when I&#x27;m editing. It is making it unusable because it pops up even after I select an option.
 Any suggestion on where I could even begin to try fixing this?

 This is done with Emacs slurping text from any buffer and barfing it into the standard Java repl, run in a background process. These phases are glued together using the repl-driven-development.el package.

 I did this in c-mode, and formatted it properly as above, but in c-ts-mode, the syntax is not properly highlighted (or highlighted, period), and moreover, if trying to type and format it, it does not seem to recognize it (specifically the backslashes to allow continuing on the next line).

                              <span>Hey! I use Cherrytree for journaling, but it has a few things I want to change, and lack a few things that I need. Plus, I&#x27;m worry about locking myself in one app, so I&#x27;m exploring the possibility of using Neovim or Emacs, but I&#x27;m aware there&#x27;s a learning curve, and before investing time, I wanted to know if I&#x27;m using the right tool.
 I need to do the following in a quick way:
 1- Encrypt a whole folder, and acces it. This folder will keep other folders with pictures and text files.
 2- Set a number of columns for the page, like 80 or 100.
 3- Have a tree-like explorer on the left, to navigate the files with the entries.
 4- Do bold, italics, and different colors.
 5- Make an index or a different way to navigate the entries, besides the tree explorer.
 6- Export everything in case I want to change the program I use to read my entries.
 7- Inserting an image from a folder, like a picture I took. It can be a miniature to click and open the original picture.
 Can Emacs do that? 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m considering to use dired as main file browser for Windows. I would like to use &quot;context.exe&quot; app (http://www.maddogsw.com/cmdutils/ ) that shows explorer context menu of specified file, but the app is not updated for more than 20 years and it seems no longer working.
 Is there any modern version of file context menu tool nowadays?

                              <span>Hello r/emacs! First-time poster here!
 I recently wanted to visualise some data in org-mode using a Python source block to generate an image, which was then rendered directly in the buffer.
 It took my a couple of goes to work out how to do it. 
 Given some data like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +begin_src bash :results output file :file data.njson
 echo &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Spock&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;James Kirk&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Vim&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Dr McCoy&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Vim&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Scotty&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Worf&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;ed&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Geordi LaForge&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Data&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Jean-luc Picard&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;VS Code&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Wesley Crusher&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;VS Code&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;William Riker&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Vim&quot;} &#x27;
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 A visualisation can be rendered as follows:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +begin_src python :results output file :file usage.png
 import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import sys
 df &#x3D; pd.read_json(&quot;data.njson&quot;, lines&#x3D;True) axes &#x3D; sns.histplot(df, x&#x3D;&quot;editor&quot;) axes.get_figure().savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The main trick here is to set the :results output file header argument to write the output to a file, and to save the figure to sys.stdout.buffer from Python.
 I&#x27;ve written about this on my blog too, where you can see the [unsurprising] results of the analysis!

                              <span>tl;dr why do my org links not have a space before them (e.g. check out thisLINK)? I feel I&#x27;m missing something very basic here.
 I was using org-roam today in doom emacs and forgot how irritating adding a new node is while writing. 
 It nestles nicely up to the text before it - with no space in between. After posting on r/orgroam a kind soul told me this might be a wider issue - at least related to org itself, and maybe doom.
 Does anyone know how to get a leading space before the node name / link? For example; my nodes come out looking like:
 something interesting is in thisNODENAME/LINK check it out
 For the love of RMS I want a space between this and NODENAME
 I&#x27;m clearly being dumb, but can&#x27;t figure this out. Surely enough people use emacs / doom emacs / org mode, and they are not all adding links everywhere with no leading space?
 A suggestion on r/orgroam was put a double space before a link - is that it?

 Can the search be restricted to the column with the names?

                              <span>Hey All,
 I wrote another beginner-focussed blog about the Table based testing in ScalaTest. 
 https://yadukrishnan.live/effective-test-parameterization-with-scalatest-tables
 This might be too basic for experienced developers. However, during code reviews and other discussions, I have noticed that a lot of test could be converted into Table-based test to improve the readability and maintainability. Hence thought of writing this.
 Please have a look and let me know if you find this useful.
 Thanks!

                              <span>For those who have reservations about the syntax of comprehensions, and there are a few, here&#x27;s one possible alternative
 The approach is to extend an existing function to handle additional argument types, so that it replicates a comprehension via a single function call. For instance a function of two integers is among other things extended to also apply to two ranges of integers. There are some similarities with vectorization (see R, MATLAB, Julia and the like), although here you don&#x27;t have to mix row vectors and column vectors.
 It&#x27;s a kind of Polish notation for comprehensions: you&#x27;re saying the same thing as before, but everything has been rearranged, and the main function comes first. Perhaps not unlike the original Polish notation, it takes some getting used to, and won&#x27;t be to everyone&#x27;s taste. But there are arguably a few advantages:
  
no need for specialized syntax: no on-the-fly variable bindings, so no left-arrows (or &quot;for&quot; or &quot;yield&quot;)
 generally more concise notation that meshes well with Scala&#x27;s use of underscores for lambda functions
 a direct style that can be used with effect handling, e.g. with Cats or ZIO
 a clear distinction between independent and dependent terms, determined by the static types
  
This last property means that by default the library is a bit of a hybrid of David Turner&#x27;s original list comprehension (which can handle any case, but always returns a sequence), and a more Julia-style array comprehension when things are &quot;rectangular&quot;. This makes it straightforward to plot a function (via JavaScript and plotly). It also means an inherent distinction between the parallelizable and the sequential, i.e. applicatives and - the term was bound to crop up eventually - monads.
 Essentially it&#x27;s a function-centric version of comprehensions, for those who would prefer not to use specialized syntax or macros, or maybe just want comprehensions in Java.

 Solution 2: (Generates pascals triangle and then indexes at the (n,k) value)
 import Control.Monad (replicateM_) main :: IO () main &#x3D; readLn &gt;&gt;&#x3D; flip replicateM_ (do l  combinations) where nextRow l@(_:t) &#x3D; 1 : (zipWith f l t) ++ [1] f x y &#x3D; (x + y) &#x60;mod&#x60; (10^8 + 7) 
 Solution 2 gets accepted but Solution 1 gets timedout for 2 test cases. They look and feel exactly the same, so wth is going on? What compiler black magic is under hood for this one?
 Solution 2 literally generates the frikin pascal tree and then indexes into that, shouldn&#x27;t this be slow compared to the bottom up approach which only looks at the previous row entry of size k?

                              <span>The FunFixture class looks like it works well when you have one or two indepenent items that need to be set up for the test. However, in my more complicated tests, I tend to have many things that need to be set up and which depend on each other.
 At the moment, using an ad-hoc set up like
 ​
 class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: var foo: Foo &#x3D; null var bar: Bar &#x3D; null var quz: Quz &#x3D; null var xyzzy: Xyzzy &#x3D; null override def beforeEach(context: BeforeEach): Unit &#x3D; foo &#x3D; Foo() bar &#x3D; Bar(foo) quz &#x3D; bar.getQuz xyzzy &#x3D; Xyzzy(foo, quz) widget &#x3D; Widget(foo, bar) test(&quot;complicated&quot;) { val results &#x3D; widget.doStuff(xyzzy) assertEquals(results, xyzzy + foo.use(bar).use(quz)) } 
 I&#x27;m not seeing a good way to write this with FunFixture My best guess is something like
 class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: val foo &#x3D; FunFixture[Foo](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Foo()) val bar &#x3D; FunFixture[Bar](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Bar(howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo())) val quz &#x3D; FunFixture[Quz](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; somehowGetBar().getQuz val xyzzy &#x3D; FunFixture[Xyzzy](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Xyzzy(getFoo(), getQuz()) val widget &#x3D; FunFixture[Widget](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Widget(getFoo(), getBar()) // Make everything into one fixture with some impressively ugly code val everything &#x3D; FunFixture.map2(FunFixture.map2(foo, bar), FunFixture.map3(quz, xyzzy, widget)) // Run the test. Make sure you get the parentheses nesting right! everything.test(&quot;complicated) { ((f, b), (q, x, w)) &#x3D;&gt; val results &#x3D; w.doStuff(x) assertEquals(results, x + f.use(b).use(q)) } 
 By this point, ad-hoc is looking simple and clean. And that&#x27;s assuming that howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo can even be written and doesn&#x27;t make it look even more complicated. And I&#x27;m not even certain you can unwrap the parameters like I did, so there may be more boilerplate just trying to get the actual values out.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a new emacs user and I&#x27;ve been using doom emacs for a while now and i&#x27;m willing to learn Elisp, but found out that it might not be as easy as it might seem at first, because as i found out, lisp is quite different from other programming languages that i&#x27;m used to, especially knowing that i&#x27;m not a programmer by any means and my programming knowledge is very little, not mentioning that elisp is pretty old so the learning resources might not be as much as other more popular programming languages
 so my question is, Is it worth it?
 like what is the level of mastery do i need to achieve to start implementing custom elisp in my configs to enhance my emacs experience?
 and how exactly can i improve my emacs experience if i learned elisp?
 in other words, how rewarding it would be

                              <span>As in topic, emacs normally open files in instant, but when autosave (#filename#) exists, it takes about 1 sec to open file.
 Any idea how to fix this without disabling autosaves? It doesn&#x27;t seem to be config problem since same happens with -Q flag.

                              <span>From the launch of the first version of Metanote on iOS to now, it&#x27;s been almost three months, and after several iterations, there have been significant improvements. I believe it&#x27;s essential to update everyone on the progress of Metanote. 
 So far, Metanote has comprehensively supported the customization options for Org mode&#x27;s Agenda view, including settings for tags, properties, subtasks, and most of the major InBufferSettings. I won&#x27;t list them all here, but you can find detailed documentation.
  
InBufferSettings
 Agenda views
 A Simple and Effective GTD Workflow
  
This weekend (November 24-27), I hosted a promotional event. If Metanote has brought convenience and value to your life and work, this might be a good time to get it.
 Upcoming Features:
  
Custom Capture
 Visibility Cycling and Rich Text
 Roam Research and Backlinks
  
Thank you all.

                              <span>I use ripgrep for searching in a project and I want to save the ripgrep buffer with the links.
 Simply saving the buffer just removes the links and leaves only plain text.
 ​
 (The reason for this is, I want to go through several parts of the code which I found with ripgrep. This will take some days, and I want to be able to keep track of my progress by going through the search results and delete the ones I already worked on.)

All of those i&#x27;ll use throughout the day but don&#x27;t do simultaneosly. I&#x27;m trying to set it up so i can save the current state for buffers and open project for work, switch to my org notes, do something there, and switch back with all buffers in place and files open where they where.
 Things like desktop-save-mode seem to handle restoring the last buffers, but aren&#x27;t working for multiple sessions. So what&#x27;s my best bet to have multiple separated &quot;setups&quot; depending on what i&#x27;m working on at the moment?

On EMACS startup after a restart, I will get an error about the permissions to autogen.sh for Auctex. I tried modifying the permissions in it, and after I get the startup warning...

Error (use-package): Cannot load xxx
  
I rechecked load-path lists and move packages to another one directory mentioned in load-path lists, which is loacted in Emacs installtion directory named site-lisp. THEN (use-pakage xxx) returned to normal and didn&#x27;t rose a warning.
 It&#x27;s so weird, and I just want to set a custom packages load-path. Does anyone know what goes wrong?

                              <span>I can grab links to specific messages in the desktop version of Apple Mail. I use Logseq to open my org files and I see the links which do open the mail app. But the message is not opened. 
 If I open them on a different desktop machine they do open the same message, just not on iOS. 
 Is there a way to do this? Maybe using a different program? I am open to anything.

                              <span>Helm-mini enables acting on the file list by using Ctrl-Space to pick those required, though I don&#x27;t know if that is the only action to be done on the selection.
 Is that behaviour unique to helm&#x27;s completing read implementation, or do other such functions exist?
 I need to create an SQL command from a selection from a long list of databases and need something that can pick them individually with highlighting, so once I press Enter, the selection is passed to a function.
 The default completing-read-multiple of typing a match and adding a comma is not suitable for this.
 UPDATE
 After some more searching I&#x27;ve come across this Embark discussion which may help me in what I need. I just need that kind of functionality in a completing-read command, basically something which lets me mark a list of items from a list and apply some arbitrary action to them.

                              <span>When debugging some code, I learned that if you call pop-to-buffer and pop-to-buffer-same-window inside save-excursion or save-current-buffer, the original buffer will not be restored at the end of the save-. You can get around this by using save-window-excursion; however, I still feel like save-excursion ought to work. Does anyone know why it doesn&#x27;t?
 (You can check this by eval-ing the following in any buffer other than *Messages*: (save-excursion (pop-to-buffer-same-window &quot;*Messages*&quot;)).

                              <span>So I was solving a couple of problems on hackerrank using haskell and I came across a question where the Data.Vector package might be useful. So ideally what I would like is since vector is not available by default, is to install it where ghc and ghci is able to see it and import Data.Vector and :m Data.Vector just works and call it a day. Kind of like in c, where you sudo apt install 
, and #include 
 works.
 Apparently for some reason it seems like a very difficult task to do. Every website/forum which I read suggest to set up a full fledged application with cabal init and then cabal install. 
 I learned that cabal packages and ghc packages are two different things (cabal list --installed and ghc-pkg list). Both maintain their own package databases (installed packages) and ghc and ghci can only see and work with ghc packages. Theres this command cabal install --libs but people on github are saying it can cause some issues and suggest against it (with one person saying it outright &quot;evil&quot;). 
 I couldn&#x27;t find a straightforward solution to this except years old articles and tons of open issues on github with people having similar problems.
 Is there no simple way to achieve this than to manually download or cabal init?

                              <span>As I get deeper into learning haskell I have noticed what seems to be &quot;Imperative Creep&quot; for the lack of a better term.
 It seems as the code gets more &quot;real world&quot; it becomes ever more imperative. In many examples across the web I see code very similar to the imperative style of a language like python. I&#x27;m not really understanding the point of all the great functional aspects of the language if you can&#x27;t write functional code for real world use cases.
 I&#x27;t&#x27;s very confusing for a beginner to wrap their brains around the functional paradigm. Then, almost immediately after understanding this new programming concept you&#x27;re hit with the Monad and all the educational literature starts you a new with imperative code - it&#x27;s maddening. Every tutorial explains that &quot;do&quot; notation makes it easier to grok the monad by allowing a more imperative approach. WTF.
 I&#x27;m not changing any minds for certain. But, honestly I think this &quot;crutch&quot; has hampered my absorption of the learning material and perhaps increased the learning curve. Additionally this also makes the beautiful syntax of haskell look more like some JS crap with all the &quot;do&quot; &quot;if&quot; and &quot;case&quot;, I mean really you can&#x27;t use functors, applicatives or monads with &quot;pattern-matching&quot;, &quot;guards&quot; and &quot;where&quot;. Perhaps I have not learned anything of functional programming?
 I&#x27;m just ranting, apologies for the negative vibes. Probably delete post after some self-reflection.

                              <span>Hello! I have to give a presentation soon about shape-generic code. I’m going to be doing it on the difference between the Foldable class and that mad thing you can do with ~~~ fold :: Bifunctor p &#x3D;&gt; (p a b -&gt; b) -&gt; Fix p a -&gt; b ~~~
 I think I can explain the functions pretty well, but I’d love to have a definition of an F-algebra that someone outside of the abstract-algebra/category theory bubble could grok.
 I should say, I’m also outside of those bubbles and only have a functional understanding of it. I can write you a type which is the F-algebra of another with no idea of what that means, only why I’d want to!

                              <span>I think I wrote some comments on this web, but I have never taken the time to introduce myself.
So... Hello! I am Fernando Nóbel :-)
I am Spanish. Still, I work in Belgium as a post-doctoral researcher in control engineering applied to synthetic biology and bioprocesses. My passions are reading, learning, and creating. I also write online about productivity, creativity, and writing. You can find my writings on my web (https://eljardindegestalt.com/).
I have participated in the ZK101 workshop with Sascha, I use Vim (with minimal plug-ins and configuration) for my Zettelkasten, and the size of my Zettelkasten reached 1.000 notes recently.
If you want to use Vim for your Zettelkasten, or if you have any other questions,  feel free to ask me anything 
See you around!</span>

                              <span>I have been a user of emacs for more than a decade. I am not a pro, but my config has swollen little by little. What really got me into emacs was the interaction with the python repl. It was amazing. Only Jupyter notebooks did something similar for me. Lately I have been using VScode, as the notebook experience for data science is very good and emacs cannot really compete here as notebooks are web based since the beggining, and vscode is an electron app. Packages like ein was just an ok replacement. Also I have been using logseq instead of org-mode, as the android app is very good and allow me to add stuff from the camera and using the pen with the whiteboard. I am mainly using org-mode to define large project files and leaving logseq for note taking. 
 The later but the hype with neovim a…</span>

                              <span>Have been using emacs for a while now with doom and have a question to the community:
 When you have a project inside of docker with packages instead by pip, how to you have your eMacs and LSP resolve the import statements?
 I have heard of TRAMP but this seems like a solution for jacking into a docker container that is running to just modify files. 
 Thanks, Aaron

 Steps: 1. When the default-directory set to ~/, M-x browse-emacs-config to open a file list of ~/.config/emacs in the minibuffer 2. embark-act on a file lisp/init-lib.el 3. o and b to open the selected file horizontally 4. A buffer opened on the right side, but the directory is still using the default-directory in step 1 instead of the buffer&#x27;s directory, causing the buffer to visit ~/lisp/init-lib.el instead of ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-lib.el.
 Config:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (defun find-file-in-project (&amp;optional dir) (interactive) (let ((project (project-current nil dir))) (project-find-file-in nil nil project)))
 (defun browse-emacs-config () (interactive) (find-file-in-project &quot;~/.config/emacs&quot;))

                              <span>It happens pretty often that I want to compute something with numbers that are between two extremes. For example, if a thing will cost between 100 and 120€ and I will need to buy betwen 2 and 4 of them, then it will cost  *  &#x3D; .
 A few times, I would like to do that with probability distributions. It&#x27;s rarer, but if I had a handy tool, I&#x27;d do that a lot of times.
 A range or a distribution could not have a valid Num instance (mostly because it has no notion of sign), but it could have a perfectly valid Field instance. Is there such a library already?

                              <span>Hello! I am fairly new to Haskell. After years of lurking into it, but scared with the syntax and so many abstractions, it was watching the first series of lectures of Cateogory Theory for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski what made me decide to start. As a mathematitian, his explanations made me very excited. I am reading some books and following at the same time this MOOC. 
 Ok, so my question is the following. I am doing the exercises of the MOOC and in one of them I am asked to do this:
  
Implement a type class Cycle that contains a function step that cycles through the values of the type.
 
Implement instances for Color and Suit that work like this:
  
step Red &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Green
 step Green &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Blue
 step Blue &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Red
 
  
The suit instance should cycle suits in the order Club, Spade, Diamond,…</span>

                              <span>I would like to sync my .org files to my website&#x27;s server in order to do the following: Every x minutes, it takes all my org files as an input and generates an .ics file which my calendar apps (on my phone, tablet, desktop, etc...) can pull to sync themselves.
 It feels kinda bloated to install a fully fledged emacs onto a small server where I only have about 50Gb of storage only to generate calendar files. Is there a way to:
  
Install only the tool that generates .ics files
 Automate it to run at a regular interval (whithout user intervention) with a crontab.
  
Thanks folks! :)
 FYI: I don&#x27;t mind that the .ics is public. I don&#x27;t store any confidential info in my tasks ;)

                              <span>I have a complex subquery (written in slick), that has a distinct on primary key tuple in it: select distinct on (intId, strId) ... from table where ....
 I also need to sort the resulting set using arbitrary columns/set of columns, so to accomplish this i would write sth like select * from(select distinct on (intId, strId) ... from table where ...) order by ....
 How do I do that in slick? Were it not for the composite primary key I would write table.filter(_.id in subQuery).sortBy(...). I don&#x27;t want to include a sorted column in a depends on clause because that might tank performance quite a lot.

                              <span>Hello all, I would like to implore the gurus around here, could you show me some magic to make this declaration shorter?
 I have this code: ~~~ getSearchV2 a &#x3D; withRequestEncrypted a proc
 where
 proc :: ProcEncrypted {} (Array Int)
 proc c b zgCode cred &#x3D; do
 pure $ Just [12]
 ~~~
 It would be nice if I can make it like this: ~~~ getSearchV2 a &#x3D; withRequestEncrypted a $ \c b zgCode cred -&gt; do
 pure $ Just [12] ~~~
 but I got the error: ~~~ The inferred type 
 forall t274. ReadForeign t274 &#x3D;&gt; Config -&gt; Context -&gt; Effect Unit 
 has type variables which are not determined by those mentioned in the body of the type: 
 t274 could not be determined 
 Consider adding a type annotation.
 ~~~
 I suppose ReadForeign comes from the definition of ProcEncrypted. So the question is: - How should I annotate the type ProcEncrypted {} (Array Int) ? - Is this can be used for forall a b. ProcEncrypted a b ?
 Thank you very much for your kind responses dear Gurus, may your light shone brighter and clearer everyday...

                              <span>I hope my question makes sense.
 I am using Doom Emacs for a while now and have become fairly proficient. But I feel like whenever I am browsing emacs content online there are still many topics for me to discover. So I was wondering if there is anything that I might be &quot;missing&quot; yet which might help with my productivity or improve my development skills.
 Sofar I what have learned, on top from my head:
  
Org/Org Agenda (refile etc.)
 Magit
 Vterm
 LSP Commands
 Multiple Cursors
 Literal Config
 Navigating Emacs itself (which key, debugging, reading Emacs-Lisp (abit))
 Using Language specific commands, i.e. send buffer to repl 
 Using Undo with Vundo
  
Only thing I know that I still need to learn is beeing more proficient with vim keybindings, but with that I know where to start.
 I know the question is quite broad, but maybe there some &quot;killer features&quot; worth to explore which I am not aware of yet.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any input.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wanting to get Eglot working so that I may use its LSP for my classes and in the future. Right now I&#x27;m trying to get it working for Python and I have pyright installed with pip (as well as node as the GitHub repo stated I&#x27;d need that installed).
 As the title says, when Eglot is trying to connect to the server, I get a jsonrpc error:  [client-reply] (id:0) ERROR Mon Nov 20 09:19:00 2023: (:jsonrpc &quot;2.0&quot; :id 0 :error) (:code -32603 :message &quot;Internal error&quot;))  I so far haven&#x27;t found any solutions on how to fix this. I&#x27;m using Windows Emacs 28.2

                              <span>Neo emacs is a configuration for GNU Emacs which is based on doom emacs and focuses on the java web application coding environment. Here is a detailed tutorial to teach you how to install doom emacs for beginners. And here have many common configurations for beginners too.
 ![img](https://github.com/sincebyte/neo-emacs/blob/master/image-use.png) 
 Neo emacs has the following features:
  
Code completion: Lsp-java supports maven and gradle project.
 Http client: Rest-client is a tool to manually explore and test HTTP REST webservices just like Postman.
 SQL client: Ejc-sql turns Emacs into a simple SQL client which supports various databases.
 Redis client: Eredis Non-blocking Redis client with focus on performance and robustness.
 Terminal emulator: Emacs-libvterm (vterm) is fully-fledged terminal emulator inside GNU Emacs based on libvterm.
 Knowledge management system: Org-roam borrows principles from the Zettelkasten method, providing a solution for non-hierarchical note-taking.
 doomorgstyle: An org html style template similar to doom doc.
  
Here I follow the rules, Try to keep the configuration of doom and enhance it. As a veteran, you may not use neo emacs directly. But the configuration here may also be useful to you! Thanks for the support!

 In this Screenshot you see the frames of two Emacs processes. The left frame has been started by emacs -q, while the right frame has been started by emacs -Q. So no personal configuration (besides .Xresources) is used. The version is Emacs 29.1., X11, Linux.
 The left frame shows the font I&#x27;d like to use, and used since many years with Emacs already. But the left frame also shows a &quot;distorted&quot; display of example characters. The important character is …. It is clearly visible in this screenshot, that Emacs changes the font (glyph?) to display this character if the character needs to be rendered in bold. (similar things happen to other characters or itallic)
 Each frame has 3 windows. The top window shows an org buffer with various characters.

                              <span>Hey, I was working on this one off and on for a few days after briefly trying out skeleton-mode, yasnippet, and some other stuff, and not really being too happy with them. I find that I have a lot of repetitive editing tasks where I need to do something to a small block of code a lot, but in the process change some names or values in a way that&#x27;s just a little bit different each time. Normally this is where people would start to reach for yasnippet and auto-yasnippet, which is fine if that works for them, but personally that&#x27;s just a bit more heavyweight and powerful than what I normally need. What I wanted was just a way to enhance a regular Emacs keyboard macro to support that sort of thing, so I wrote this. If it helps you too, wonderful!

                              <span>No, it&#x27;s not a troll post.
 I just spent an hour in a tute with our lecturer trying to honestly convince us that emacs/orgmode is literally the best tool for everything ever. Even after someone asked him to add an image to his little demo and it took literally FIVE MINUTES and then he cant even format it or move it on the page.
 Every Youtube tutorial is the same - people typing and typing and tying for 20 minutes at a time to do what I can on my phone in literally 30 seconds. Endless Endless ENDLESS obscure shortcuts and menus inside menus beneath submenus - all with no intuitive or conceptual link to navigate between disconnected dumps of unformatted text.
 Even within a single page, theres never anything resembling a visual cue to explain what youre doing to what. And even when you do figure out what one peice of random highlighting means, you can&#x27;t get anywhere without typing MORE obscure &quot;shortcuts&quot;. HOW is this better than point and click? Who in their right mind would abandon ~30 years of interface progress for this demonstrably worse navigation method?
 I WOULD say it&#x27;s the worst UX I&#x27;ve ever seen on any utility, ever - except there literally is not UX . All you end up with, everywhere, is a nigh-on-useless bricks of text, only clumsily navigated through with MORE STUPID SHORTCUTS . How anyone could be expected to manage anything with this is beyond all of us.
 Now he expects us to bring lesson summaries to the tute every week in this incomprehensible garbage, and literally NOBODY in the class has ANY idea how to organise anything in what as far as we can tell is just a glorified notepad, or why it even exits.
 What am I missing?
 EDIT: Well, from the look of the downvotes and cope in the comments, this is going to be one of THOSE &quot;open source&quot; communities. So I think I&#x27;ll drop the course for something useful instead. Thanks!

                              <span>The title pretty much says it all, but here’s the verbose bit.
 I’m storing all of my Ansible playbooks in an Org doc, with each play getting its own separate heading. Ansible requires a name for each play, and I’m already naming the heading, so I’m attempting to save a touch of typing.
 What I have:
 * Disable screen locking #+begin_src yaml - name: Disable screen locking community.general.dconf: key: &quot;/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled&quot; value: &quot;false&quot; state: present #+end_src 
 What I’m aiming for, that when tangled, comes as out as above:
 * Disable screen locking #+begin_src yaml - name: $HEADING community.general.dconf: key: &quot;/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled&quot; value: &quot;false&quot; state: present #+end_src

                              <span>Apologies if the following seems dumb. I’m trying to figure something out with cats-effect-3 and scala. I have the following class structure:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; trait Resource { def execute(): F[Output] }
 class A[F[_]] extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] &#x3D; ??? }
 class B[F[_]](a: A[F]) extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] &#x3D; { a.execute().flatMap(…) } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Each Resource type has an execute method whose output I want to memoize. So that dependent classes (there may be a third class C that can call a.execute) may call it multiple times in any order but they will all get the same value as a result. This would be pretty straightforward with scala’s Future (if I use It instead of F).
 I‘ve seen Async.memoize. However, that changes the signature to F[F[Output]] and I can only execute the “outer” flatMap once, or the results are re-calculated. In this case, I’m not sure how I would allow the dependent classes to use the memoized output.
 I’m relatively new to the Typelevel ecosystem, and I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this correctly. How would I modify the code such that my effect gets executed only once, no matter how many times I call it?
 Should I use the non-typelevel concurrency primitives to handle this outside the effect-system and then wrap it in F?
 I know I can probably orchestrate the “graph” of execution without having each dependent class doing this. But I need to chain the calls these way for the time being.
 ——
 UPDATE [2023/11/20]: For now, I’m going with an AtomicCell that wraps an Option value, and setting it to Some if it’s None (the initial value) using evalUpdateAndGet. This doesn’t seem very elegant though.

I cant run them directly from vscode using Metal. I looked around and found a way to run the libraries directly but it only works with Scala worksheets.
 This is an example of what was used.
 import $dep.&#x60;org.typelevel::cats-core:2.10.0&#x60;
 ​
 But I want to know how I could import and run 3rd party libraries directly from vscode without getting the error &quot;Cats not found&quot;

                              <span>I am confused of what the workflow when developing with Haskell is these days.
 For example I am not sure whether I should from the very beginning of a project have a .cabal file, i.e. whether I should start all projects by running cabal init first. Shouldn&#x27;t building a package be one of the last steps in a project?
 What do people do if they, say only want to try out a package? With python for example you would probably create a virtual environment, install the package in it, import it in your source file and go.
 The analog to that solution would be sandboxes I assume, but as far as I understand those are depreciated these days.
 I used Haskell ~3 years ago, always installed packages globally, and then worked mainly with ghci. This was probably not ideal back then, but seems to not even work quite the same way today (cabal install 
 says 
 is not exposed or something along these lines).
 From what I read here, it seems that a &quot;python like workflow&quot; maybe works when working with nix (instead of cabal?).
 Can somebody help lift my confusion? I find it very difficult to get started with Haskell these days, bc I find the tooling and the documentation really confusing.

                              <span>I&#x27;m attempting to make a minimal JSON validation thing to work with aeson like so (relevant bits):
 -- the (-.) is just a flipped (.) ensure :: (Validation v, ValType v ~ a) &#x3D;&gt; Parser a -&gt; v -&gt; Parser a ensure parser validator &#x3D; (parser &gt;&gt;&#x3D; validate validator -. maybe (fail $ errMsg validator) pure) &#x60;parserCatchError&#x60; \path _ -&gt; do let !_ &#x3D; traceShowId @JSONPath path undefined class Validation v where type ValType v validate :: v -&gt; ValType v -&gt; Maybe (ValType v) errMsg :: v -&gt; String data NotBlank &#x3D; NotBlank instance Validation NotBlank where type ValType NotBlank &#x3D; Text validate _ txt &#x3D; guard (not $ T.null txt) $&gt; txt errMsg _ &#x3D; &quot;can&#x27;t be blank&quot; 
 and with basic usage like so:
 newtype Action &#x3D; Action { body :: Text } deriving (Show) instance FromJSON Action where parseJSON &#x3D; withObject &quot;Action&quot; $ \v -&gt; Action  v .: &quot;body&quot; &#x60;ensure&#x60; NotBlank 
 which is all fine and dandy but when it does fail from my own manual fail calls, it doesn&#x27;t pass the JSONPath to the error handler
 λ&gt; eitherDecode @Action &quot;{ \&quot;body\&quot;: 3 }&quot; [Key &quot;body&quot;] λ&gt; eitherDecode @Action &quot;{ \&quot;body\&quot;: \&quot;\&quot; }&quot; [] -- No path to be seen :( 
 I know I could manually pass in the key/path to the validation types (like v .: &quot;body&quot; &#x27;ensure&#x27; NotBlank &quot;body&quot;), but like, that takes extra characters to write, and I don&#x27;t have the time for that :)
 I&#x27;ve tried looking around but there&#x27;s basically zero info on this sort of thing. Any suggestions/solutions?

 The question is:
 Am I right, despite a huge functionality included in the base, Haskell doesn&#x27;t have a simple State Monad, encapsulating s -&gt; (a, s) in the Base?
 To cope with that, I added mtl 2.3.1 and imported Control.Monad.State 
 Maybe I&#x27;m missing something?

 So this is probably naive question, but have to ask it because I need an advice. It is a longer post, so if you do not want to read it all, just check the bold text.
 3 weeks ago I started with Haskell. I do not have a background in CS and my job is CS/IT unrelated. I program since elementary school (I&#x27;m now 36) and do it as a hobby and for fun. I use Ruby and Javascript/Typescript, with some quite limited experience in C++. I did try with Haskell before, like in 3-4 occasions (for the first time more than 10 years ago), but usually I just gave up (primary because of lack time and the things were going slow, so I just lose motivation and interest).
 Now I want to do the right thing and push it all the way to the &quot;end&quot; (&#x3D;&#x3D; actually write something, then improve it further by pra…</span>

                              <span>New to the world of zettelkasten and could use some guidance about my zettels. So what Ive done here is I created my first 3 zettels out of a reference note from this article: https://ckrybus.com/static/papers/luhmann1981.pdf supplemented with the translation from sacha on this website since my German is &quot;meh&quot; at best.
The first 2 share some overlap, don&#x27;t know if I should combine them. Tried to stay true to the 1 idea per note thing. All tips are welcome so dont hold back!

Communication with a zettelkasten favors an open system without hierarchy, structure and/or order, but instead focuses on making connections. While communicating with your zettelkasten the openness could lead to unexpected connections/insight. This is were the power of the zettelkasten lies.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always been curious about Emacs but never made the plunge. I usually prefer vim/markdown vs org-mode/emacs. I&#x27;ve been using Logseq for some time but find the interface too sluggish. I found &quot;ekg&quot; emacs plugin but it&#x27;s missing a few features to replace Logseq. I would like for all my notes to be combined into a single graph where they can be directly edited/manipulated without having to open up another buffer. Any other plugins aside from ekg that would give me a Logseq-like experience? (no org-mode, no note titles) Thanks!
 ​
 edit: thank you all for your valuable input. Everyone has been so nice and helpful, what a great community!

                              <span>I am 100 % a keyboard only user, but sometimes i want to relax and browse dired only with one hand. But the standart behaviour of dired , when clicking on files or directories, is really ass. Thus i wrote some code to gain this functionality:
 Left-Mouse-Click: The same as Pressing Enter
 Right-Mouse-Click: close current buffer and go to last visible buffer
 ​
 thus you can left click on entry, then go back with right click which is super fast and handy. Try it out !!!
 (I am using evil, but you can easily bind the keys with :
 (define-key dired-mode-map .... )
 code:
 ​
 (defun my/dired-jump (event)
 (interactive &quot;e&quot;)
 (mouse-drag-region event)
 (dired-find-file))
 ​
 (defun my/dired-jump-close ()
 (interactive)
 (kill-current-buffer))
 ​
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/dired-jump-close)
 ​
 (evil-define-key &#x27;(normal visual motion emacs) dired-mode-map
 (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/dired-jump)

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to preview the results of a grep search within files as well as fold the output when there are multiple matches in the same file.
 helm-projectile-ag is my current grepping tool but doesn&#x27;t seem to offer such a facility, unless I haven&#x27;t read the docs well enough.
 My issues are:
  
It can present a lot of hits in the same file it but lists each one separately. A good option would be to fold the output when there are multiple matches, then I can use the Tab keep to expand the fold and scan through the previews and even edit them right away.
 
The search panel is modal. It doesn&#x27;t create a result buffer which you can save and then return to later to continue to select files to edit. Once you lose focus it is gone. It doesn&#x27;t even seem to retain the search term so you can use it later.
 
It would be nice to have a window that shows the actual CLI command passed to the search utility. I see them once in a while but it would be good to show them up front or make them easily accessible.
 
 Do any of the project grep tools or helm-projectile-ag itself offer such features?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I&#x27;m mostly a Java dev who ran into Scala 2 a few years back and now I wanted to try out version 3, just for fun. My IDE of choice is IntelliJ, so I tried to make it work there, but so far, not very successfully.
 The first attempt was &quot;the way I know&quot; - build using Maven and use the IntelliJ Scala plugin for everything. But there was basically no help from the IDE (no autocomplete etc.).
 So I tried doing it &quot;the Scala way&quot; - installed SBT, created a project using the official guide, imported as a BSP project into Intellij using this guide and everything seemed to work - I can run the thing at least :-)
 But when I try to Ctrl+Click something from the standard library (like Seq or max on an Iterable), the IDE navigates to sources of 2.13 instead of 3.3.1. I tried enabling the BSP logs and the classpath SBT is returning is something like
 [ &quot;file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/classes/&quot;, &quot;file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/test-classes&quot;, &quot;file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala3-library_3/3.3.1/scala3-library_3-3.3.1.jar&quot;, &quot;file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.10/scala-library-2.13.10.jar&quot; ] 
 is it OK that it&#x27;s sending both Scala 2 and 3 jars? How can I make IntelliJ go to the Scala 3 stdlib on Ctrl+click?
 I&#x27;m sure I must be doing a simple msitake somewhere, but I&#x27;m out of ideas what to try. I already tried creating a new project from scratch, updating Intellij to the latest version, reinstalling SBT, nothing helps...
 Thanks in advance for any help or pointers!

                              <span>Hello there! I am playing around with Scala 3 inline features and trying to implement some compile-time safe things. Now I am wondering, is there any way to proof that if N &gt;&#x3D; 0, then S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 in compile-time? I.e. can I derive an instance of S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true from the instance of N &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true?
 I&#x27;ve tried a naive way to implement this using inline given:  inline given snGeq[N &#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true): (S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true) &#x3D; summonInline  however the compiler cannot type check it in case when I try to use this implicit on type level, e.g. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import scala.compiletime.ops.int.* import scala.compiletime.*
 inline given snGeq[N &#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true): (S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true) &#x3D; summonInline
 sealed trait SizedList[+A, Size &#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true) case object SNil extends SizedList[Nothing, 0] case class SCons[+A, TailSize &lt;: Int](head: A, tail: SizedList[A, TailSize]) extends SizedList[A, S[TailSize]] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; does not type check.

                              <span>When using cs-ts-mode, it incorrectly forces me to use paranthesis. For example:
  if (whatever &#x3D;&#x3D; -1) 
 it won&#x27;t auto-indent the next line unless I use braces {} with the if statement, even if there is just one statement with a semi-colon after the if. Also, as I&#x27;m typing, it weirdly indents my functions as I type them.
 Any way to fix these?

                              <span>Aside from new language sources that the community can contribute at any time, this package feels more or less feature complete now.
 v1.0.0 on GitHub
 For those who don&#x27;t know, treesit-auto enables automatic detection, installation, and usage of tree-sitter grammars and modes in Emacs 29+. Vanilla Emacs exposes some variables and functions that facilitate this behavior, but without treesit-auto it&#x27;s up to you to check when tree-sitter is available and configure how Emacs behaves when it is (or isn&#x27;t). This package takes that work away from you and is designed to fit what the vast majority of users would expect from automatic use of tree-sitter in Emacs.
 This started out as just my own configuration to treesit-language-source-alist, major-mode-remap-alist, and auto-mode-alist, but now has a lot of features that didn&#x27;t exist just under a year ago when I first announced it.
  
Automatic detection and installation for built-in tree-sitter modes, such as rust-ts-mode, yaml-ts-mode, toml-ts-mode, typescript-ts-mode, and go-ts-mode. You can get this behavior through the treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist function (the name is too long...I know)
 Less buggy behavior overall, such as ensuring we switch to the tree-sitter mode after installing it
 Detecting and installing grammars required by the current mode, such as TypeScript and TSX requiring each other
  
This package isn&#x27;t perfect. It&#x27;s honestly still a bit of a hack, and many parts of the code are too clever for my own liking. It does its job, though, and I&#x27;ve been a happy, daily user of it for the last 9 months or so. Of course, a big thank you to all who have supported the project and contributed to it along the way!

                              <span>Hello, I have immensely nested directories and very long filenames, some take up 3 lines when full screen.
 Is there a way to shorten them or have just the name of the bookmark/file show up in the dashboard?
 Sorry if noob question but I am a noob.

                              <span>Im looking for a package or code snippets implementing a virtual keyboard in an emacs buffer, similar to what calc does but allowing full keyboard input (e.g. meta, super, letters, return ...). Is something like this allready in existance or does it have to be writen based on the calc code?

                              <span>Hey hey.
 I use the heck out of tuedachu/ytdl. One thing I would like to improve about it is that when you queue a download with ytdl-download it appears to be a synchronous call and it freezes emacs until youtube-dl/yt-dlp is able to start the actual download.
 I&#x27;ve yet to dive into the code to see what synchronous function is being called -- I&#x27;m very aware of the &quot;single-threaded&quot; nature of Emacs -- but I use other libraries that are likely shelling and they do not hang like this and so I would like to see if there&#x27;s a way to I can bring whatever technique they are using over to a PR against tuedachu/ytdl.
 Appreciate any advice from the crew here.

                              <span>Hi everyone. So im new to emacs and im currently using doom emacs on my laptop.
 Everything is working fine, but today i decided to install it on my desktop. Im using all the settings from my laptop, but for some reason when i press enter on a link for example, emacs just goes down a line similiar to me pressing the down arrow/j key. This happens on all the links.
 Any idea what the issue could be? This doesnt happen on my laptop
 Edit: Just to clarify, clicking on the link with my mouse works normally.
 Edit 2: Okay so apparently i needed to just do a doom sync since no profile was loaded i think. It said &quot;generating profile&quot; and now it works :) Noob misstake, but ill let this post still be here if anyone runs into the same problem in the future

 You can take a look here https://github.com/TxGVNN/project-tasks
 I developed and use it a long time, and it helps me a lot of to manage tasks I need to run on a project.
 Example: tasks.org
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +name: docker-compose up
 +begin_src compile :name &quot;docker-compose-up&quot; :results none
 docker-compose up -d
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 You can see more examples in tasks.org on repository.

                              <span>Hi all!
 This is mostly the question. I decided to give to lsp-bridge a chance, but I am having this issue with Corfu. 
 https://preview.redd.it/vh8ku4xru31c1.png?width&#x3D;629&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;3a69667f9c63b6948e0b91ad2ea8254b27ff3524
 I installed Corfu using this PR in doom https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/pull/7002
 I would like to use lsp-bridge when there is an LSP server available, but Corfu otherwise (minibuffer, plain text, etc.). Moreover, I tried this, but it didn&#x27;t work:
 (add-hook! &#x27;lsp-bridge-mode-hook (lambda () (corfu-mode -1))) 
 Thanks for your assistance!

                              <span>EDIT i guess i found a solution stackoverflow
 End EDIT
 ----
 as mind map user I like to jot idea with parent, children, sibling hierarchy.
 I am not satisfied with the present method of creating the three above as need to do a lot of adjustments ex option+ enter to create a new sibiling then ,Shift+ to adapt the sibiling as a parent or sub. As I am in a creative process would like a faster way to achieve this.
 For long list of sibilings I resolved writing in plain text the list and then shift+V and jjjj to select the list and then i launch toggle-heading, but this does not work if I add myself spaces in the plain text.
 Please do you know a fast way to open a parent/children/sibiling node, I see a shortcut could be a solution, but do not know if is a good idea because should combine more commands

                              <span>I have a number of edits I need to do to yaml files. I&#x27;d like to drive emacs in the following way: mapcar over a list calling a function that opens a file, searches for a match, switches to interactive mode so I can adjust point, inserts some pre-formatted data specific to the match, allows me to edit the insertion to fix the inevitable typos that exist and, when I&#x27;m ready, saves the file and moves to the next element. I&#x27;m automating the file and buffer navigation as well as the content insertion but doing precise placement and editing by hand. Sadly, I did this once previously years ago but I don&#x27;t remember how.
 Relevant rant: this stupidity&#x27;s only necessary because yaml&#x27;s flexibility for too many ways to do the same thing so reading the yaml in, adjusting the data structures and writing it back out make pull requests horrific as minute semantic changes can have massive syntactic ones.

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Workouts and exercise programs for a 67-year-old who wants his final decade to be active.
I&#x27;m tweaking my ZK Dashboard. I&#x27;m trimming information that is distracting and reformating some, so it is more engaging. This is an iterative process. This work fits my personality.
I&#x27;m seriously thinking of restarting my ZK fresh. So far, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits, but the difference is getting closer to a tipping point.

                              <span>The following code works as I would expect, printing 4:
 do return 4 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print 
 However, I was surprised to find that this works just as well:
 do return 4 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print 
 Naively, since both lines are at the same indent level, I expected this code to be equivalent to do { return 4; &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print } which does not typecheck, as expected. 
 Apparently, the correct equivalence is do { return 4 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print }. It seems that the two separate lines have been treated as one, despite being at the same indent level in a do block.
 What is the rule that governs this?

                              <span>I sometimes run into this slightly annoying situation when I&#x27;m building up a programme, in which I would like to eliminate, add, or swap arguments around in a function definition.
 I&#x27;m going to talk about this from the perspective of this simple set of definitions:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; newtype Person &#x3D; Person { name :: Text } data Lang &#x3D; EN | FR
 hello :: Lang -&gt; Text hello EN &#x3D; &quot;hello&quot; hello FR &#x3D; &quot;salut&quot;
 greet :: Person -&gt; Lang -&gt; Text greet person lang &#x3D; hello lang  &quot; &quot;  name person &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Let&#x27;s take the Helix editor (which I&#x27;m playing with as my daily driver). It&#x27;s annoying because, even if I use the treesitter integration to, say, select the object, delete it, move to the other side of the arrow, and paste it in, I still have to go and write/delete a load of -&gt;. Admittedly, this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but I remember when I was playing with clojure many years ago in vim, and I sort of loved the ability, via vim-sexp, to move things around -- into lists, out of lists, forward and backwards within a list, etc..
 I was therefore thinking: &quot;I wonder if it&#x27;s possibly to do this in my editor&quot;, and wanted to start with something as simple as &quot;can I move the argument backwards / forwards&quot;, by which I mean, with respect to the greet function defined above: &quot;can I swap the Person and Lang arguments so instead of greet myPerson EN I do greet EN myPerson?&quot;
 I thought maybe treesitter would be a nice way to achieve this, but I really have no idea where to start (and if there is a better way). Any ideas?

                              <span>Except for popular libraries. Most of the libraries have insufficient or no documention / tutorial at all. For other programming languages such as Java/Python, one will find many blogs/tutorials/docs on almost all fields. While for Haskell there are not even YouTube videos of &quot;How to do&quot;.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>This is a bit off-topic because it&#x27;s not necessarily using Haskell but it&#x27;s connected enough that I hope it&#x27;s ok that I post here.
 I&#x27;d like to write proofs about category theory, and I&#x27;d like to mechanize them, so that the compiler/type checker will check the proofs for me. Think, for example, of writing the proofs for the usual exercises you find in category theory books (e.g., from Benjamin Pierce&#x27;s book, page 35, &quot;Show that in any Cartesian closed category, B{AxA&#x27;} is isomorphic to (BA )A&#x27;&quot;, or page 41, &quot;Show that if an F-algebra (F a) is initial in the category F-Alg [defined before] then a is an isomorphism&quot;).
 What would be good languages to write such proofs? Idris? Lean? Agda?

                              <span>I use the feed provided by https://updates.orgmode.org/feed/updates, but I see that https://updates.orgmode.org/ is down -- I get a 502 error. Has this page been deprecated or is this just a temporary hitch? 
 I realize I could switch to https://list.orgmode.org/new.atom , but just thought I should check.

                              <span>i&#x27;m pretty sure i&#x27;m overthinking this but why does doom emacs have
 SPC-c c for compiling
 and SPC-c C for recompiling
 i thought it should&#x27;ve been other way round as i generally put the command for compiling and then just keep recompiling repeatedly and i believe doing SPC-c c is faster than pressing SPC-c C
 ​
 when so you either have four keys to press by doing SPC-c c  to recompile
 or you have to press four keys by doing SPC-c c assuming you press shift for C
 what i prefer doing is using SPC-c c for recompiling only three keys to press 
 and SPC-c c for compiling normally
 ​
 it&#x27;s just a little thing annoying me whenever i go from one config of doom emacs to another
 every person i&#x27;ve seen doesn&#x27;t reconfigure this. but they do seem to be bothered by this they do realize how annoying it is but don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle to remap that
 ​
 what do you guys think am i too paranoid about this is my OCD kicking in or do you feel the same ?

                              <span>I just installed emacs for Android from the fdroid store. I do not see a way for me to grant storage access to my local device. Without that permission, I don&#x27;t see how I can edit files, particularly org files, on my local device
 I will put a screenshot of my apps permissions in a comment.

 I switched to guix as the package manager following system-crafters tutorial. I have correct setup the PATH variable so that binaries from guix are accessible, but still magit is not able find emacsclient even though it is there and I can launch it from shell. No changes to the configure has been made. Used to work this morning but after removing apt emacs and installing emacs via guix I get this issue.
 Config:
  (use-package magit :bind ((&quot;C-c g&quot; . #&#x27;magit-status)))

                              <span>For whatever reason I do not like leading whitespace. Is there any way to configure org-mode to treat - - as a list subitem, instead of (or in addition to) the \ \ -?
  - This is a foo - - This is a foo subitem - This is a bar - - This is a bar subitem - - This is another bar subitem

 Killing the buffer and reopening the file lets me update the table once.
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>emacs noob here.
 I&#x27;m rewriting my init.el file from scratch using use-package macro. In my existing init file I use require to configure MELPA package archive. 
 (require &#x27;package)
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;MELPA&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 (package-initialize)
 Can I rewrite this using use-package macro?

                              <span>hi fellow r/emacs ers,
 I use org-attach a lot in my notes. And I also have a default temp folder on my disk where everything I collect lands in (created automatically by emacs at startup, using the date as variable for its name).
 When I try to attach a file using org-attach, the default folder shown is the root of my note folder, it varies according to the notes.
 What can I do to have my default temp directory (created using &#x27;(make-directory mydailytempdir)&#x27; ) to be the first goal shown when opening an &#x27;org-attach&#x27; process looking for new attachments?
 I tried to look into the elisp file &#x27;org-attach.el&#x27;, but my elisp-fu is not good enough...
 I guess using embark could help, but it would add many keypresses... I&#x27;d like to avoid it.
 is there a way to have a selection of path to choose from when opening org-attach (that could be defined in the init.el)??
 thanks for your time and replies

                              <span>Still on Emacs 27.1. I&#x27;m sure this behaviour is recent and has not always been the case. At startup my after-save-hook is nil. When I first open an org file this changes to (rmail-after-save-hook) despite not using rmail. This is normal though based on this answer from Eli. In other org buffers the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t) whether under version control or not as global-diff-mode is enabled. For python files the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t ws-butler-after-save) as ws-butler-mode is enabled in the prog-mode-hook. What am I missing that could cause this behaviour? It is occurring irrespective of the buffer and only if there are changes to be saved.

That is I wanting buffers that I don&#x27;t have to name or explicitly save that will still be there if emacs (or computer itself) are restarted.

                              <span>Say I&#x27;m using Shardcake 2.1.1 which has a dependency on Caliban 2.4.0, which has zio-http 3.0.0-RC2 as a dependency.
 In the same app I want to also use zio-http 3.0.0-RC3 directly for an API, and want that version specifically because it has some features I really want (namely the new routes DSL). It&#x27;s compiling just fine, but I&#x27;m getting run time errors:
 java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information: localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:8087 
 Is there a way to handle this without having to fork and/or compile my own versions of Shardcake and Caliban locally until a release or snapshot is made with zio-http-RC3 (or some other future version that has the features I want)? I think I remember having a similar issue in the past because I wanted to use tapir with Caliban and each had a dependency on a different version of zio-http... I got it to compile and then run by breaking up the project into several sub-projects making sure there were no overlaps in dependencies, but this was kind of unwieldy considering it was a fairly small project, so I&#x27;d rather not do that again.
 Do correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but from what I&#x27;ve read this isn&#x27;t an Scala-only thing and also affects Java, so I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a commonly known workaround for this that I don&#x27;t know of (maybe some eviction policies in the sbt file, or in Java&#x27;s case pom file?).

 I&#x27;ve also learnt they are actively hiring (Bloomberg in general) but at least for entry level positions there is a team matching where you can find a team that uses Haskell in production.
 Thought it might be interesting to some other Haskell fans in search of jobs! :)

Announcing conformance by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
This post announces the conformance library factored out from ical. It implements RFC 2119 in order to help you write implementations for other specifications. The conformance library exists to let you write a single parser that you can then run in multiple modes: strict and lenient.

A mess of cables and knobs
I used to play piano as a kid.
As a teenager, I became frustrated by the limitations of the instrument and started getting into synthesizers.
That was a thrilling experience. Being able to turn a few knobs and get a totally different — and brand new — sound was an amazing feeling.
But it was also frustrating. There are so many ways in which you can tune such an instrument (including so many ways of getting an awful sound out of it) that I ended up spending all of my time trying to come up with the right sound, and I didn’t have any left to a…</span>

 Is there any method or configuration that allows imenu to select the function currently under the cursor as the default choice?

                              <span>Context: 
 I&#x27;ve used Emacs off and on for many years at this point. Throughout that time there have been periods where I really leaned in to it and tried to use it for everything, and there have been periods where I only used it for org and/or magit, etc. I&#x27;ve learned lots of things about it and I&#x27;ve forgotten lots of things about it, but I&#x27;ve never been what I would call an &quot;expert&quot; or even a &quot;power user&quot;. So, when I feel like something isn&#x27;t working well in Emacs, I almost always default to the assumption that I&#x27;m doing something wrong or misunderstanding something, etc. 
 So, it very well may be that I&#x27;m wrong/crazy in my recent conclusion that use-package might not be the ideal abstraction for managing Emacs packages.
 With that out of the way, I&#x27;ll say that when I first saw use-packag…</span>

                              <span>Good morning,
 I recently have become enamored of Typst for document creation. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s approachable, it&#x27;s cross platform, and it&#x27;s extremely capable even in preview beta. I never really got the swing of LaTeX with all the backslash/curlybrace mayhem. 
 In any event, I find myself actually working on a long technical document in Typst in Emacs. There does exist typst-ts-mode so thanks tree-sitter and all those people who manage the grammar libraries for it. However I&#x27;m finding myself in need of a better way of navigating the huge document to get to sections I want to do.
 I looked into the baked-in bookmarks and I could probably use that capability, though I was hoping for more of an customizeable outline mode. Manually setting the bookmarks for an entire document seems tedious. I mainly just want to navigate by headings and that would be sufficient.
 What do people use for this sort of thing (possibly in the LaTeX world?) Just bookmarks with some sort of automated way of populating the bookmarks? I did check the typst-ts-mode and while there are some functions there for compiling, there don&#x27;t seem to be any functions for navigating by semantic structures. Perhaps that&#x27;s baked into tree-sitter itself?
 Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated here.

 I&#x27;m excited to share my new package with you that I&#x27;ve been working on - EMT (Emacs MacOS Tokenizer).
 EMT leverages macOS&#x27;s built-in NLP tokenizer by dynamic module to tokenize and handle CJK words in Emacs. It also introduces a minor mode (emt-mode) that remaps functions forward-word, backward-word, mark-word, kill-word, and backward-kill-word to their CJK compatible versions.

                              <span>So after my struggles getting this setup going I&#x27;m really enjoying this setup.
 Thought I&#x27;d post here as there is quite a bit of intersectionality between the emacs, Arch, Steamdeck, Nix and Mechboards communities.
 Spec as follows:
  
Steamdeck (LCD);
 SteamOS 3.5 Preview (Arch based and compatible with Nix packages);
 Emacs 29 (via Nix package);
 DooM config + some tweaks of my own; and
 Corne Light v2 with random DSA caps.
  
Ambitions for this setup are:
  
Better emacs-fu (thanks to everyone here with their help so far);
 RGB underglow on the keyboard for 90s vibes;
 Printed keycaps in jazzy colours;
 Better keymap (maybe Miryoku or something with homerow mods)

                              <span>Hi,
 I was thinking how we can solve the ctrl+c &quot;problem&quot;, I found that the ctrl+c with cua-mode is working as copy when a region is selected and it is working az prefix when there is no region selected.
 I would like to ask that is possible to change the ctrl+c in the &quot;c&quot; codebase easily or I don&#x27;t know where ?
 It can be a patch and create a custom build to myself ...
 Or I just live with it and there is no way to put this &quot;user prefix&quot; to an other key combination ?
 thanks for the answers!

 I&#x27;m trying to set up emacs for webdev and I cannot get good completions for html and css. I have installed lsp-mode and html-ls along with css-ls, but completions are still rather poor compared to VSCode.
 Is there a way to get better autocomplete?

                              <span>A few days ago I asked if there was a Vim port of Denote. Well, I went ahead and had ChatGPT help me make one.
 Here it is: https://git.sr.ht/~ashton314/vim-denote
 Why make this? So my Vim-using friends (what can I say—I&#x27;m a tolerant guy) can work with me on some shared Denote-formatted notes.
 Is the package awful? Yes. Am I gonna fix it? No. I&#x27;ve written enough Vim script to last a long time. I&#x27;ll go back to the nice land of Emacs Lisp now. (In spite of all its warts, it&#x27;s still a Lisp and therefore beautiful.)

                              <span>In the spirit of transparency and buzz and excitement, I want to share with you some progress I&#x27;m making on The Archive&#x27;s plugin system.
Starting with an odd one to not spoil all too much at once 
Today was the first time I used the very much work-in-progress development view to verify a couple of JavaScript quirks in the interactive REPL. It&#x27;s basically line-by-line code execution to test algorithms and poke around things:

The top part is the actual script editing part and filled with a placeholder comment. Nothing to see there yet.
So here&#x27;s a verified rumor -- the scripting language will be JavaScript by default. Reason for that is the excellent and secure environment Apple provides out of the box. (Other languages I would have preferred would require us to ship the language environment or depend on the user installing everything. So this is currently the only sane way to get started. Let&#x27;s see what the future holds, though.)</span>

                              <span>In my experience, if you view mathematical programming as hammering a nail in, MATLAB gives you scissors when you really need a hammer.
 I wish to abstract away from all MATLAB code writing by creating a code generator in Haskell. I am curious if you know of any projects that deal with similar problems I could use for inspiration. For now, I have a scope for the problem:
 The generator should be able to produce algorithms dealing with arrays and linear algebraic objects. Combining the right types from the vector-space and linear libraries, it should be possible to
  
operate on types like SquareMatrix, which get translated to an if condition with error on the start of the MATLAB function- evaluate linear functions, operators, maps and folds as imperative code from some basic building blocks.
 These computations will likely be in their own possibly monadic type and it should be possible to evaluate actions into either MATLAB code or direct execution as if it were a (almost) pure haskell function.
 Actions can be used to define MATLAB functions. Code generated from computations using a defined function should not repeat code, but generate the correct call instead

 So, I&#x27;m using Guix to manage my dependencies because of its high reproducibility. Guix has the wonderful &#x60;shell&#x60; command that allows the user to spawn a shell with the desired tools and use it. So, I&#x27;m writing an org file for a research project of mine that has shell, R, and Python blocks.
 The &#x60;:shebang&#x60; command works quite well to orient the shell where to run a particular block:
 #+NAME: no-cow #+BEGIN_SRC shell :shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash cowsay &quot;Hello Babel&quot; || echo &quot;There isn&#x27;t any cow here.&quot; #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: no-cow : There isn&#x27;t any cow here. #+NAME: has-cow #+BE…</span>

                              <span>The context here is, I&#x27;m working in a company environment that is using https://trunk.io in its dev environment, which is kind of a meta-linter for many languages. It wraps a bunch of backend lint tools and combines their results, and enforces a company wide policy on all of them. They provide integrations for a few IDEs, but nothing specific to emacs yet. What they do provide is an LSP proxy to their tool. I have been looking if there is any support in flymake or flycheck to use a generic LSP server as the checker backend, and I haven&#x27;t found anything. Does anyone know if this is possible? Or if there&#x27;s an existing backend that&#x27;s close enough that could be tweaked to do this? I&#x27;ve attempted to duplicate the trunk configuration using individual flymake backends, and the maintenance is just too much. It would be way easier to just make use of the tool directly.

                              <span>By forward function declarations I mean what is needed when a function defined later in the file is called from a preceding one.
 By circular I mean file A requires a function in file B which requires a function in file A. Something along those lines
 PS. Apologies for inquiring about this again. I am sure I enquired sometime in the past and forgotten the actual question and the response to it.

 I was surprised to see Emacs on wayland was running slower than its counterpart on Xwayland. Also the fonts issue was not fixed.
 While zooming in makes the fonts look better. On X i don&#x27;t have this issue.

                              <span>If I understand it right, goto-last-change should go to the places where I made the last edits. But often, when I want to go back, it seems to have &quot;forgotten&quot; them, jumps to a very old edit, and then displays &quot;No further change info&quot; in the minibuffer.
 I just had the problem again. I made sure the edits are very far away, many lines in the same org-buffer. Neither goto-last-change-reverse nor goto-last-change does find them. But when I use undo-redo, all my &quot;forgotten&quot; edits are found and subsequently undone. How can that be?
 Do you use a different function for going back to the last edits? Or am I using goto-last-change in a wrong way? The variable glc-default-span is set to 8, and I am using Org mode version 9.6.9 and Emacs 29.1. Thank you for any advice!
 Edit: I also use undo-fu-session, could it be that this interferes with goto-last-change?

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m getting really frustrated by how unpredictable &#x60;C-&#x60; mappings are when it&#x27;s bound to both uppercase and lowercase character. What I&#x27;ve tried:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-q&quot;) &#x27;cmd) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-Q&quot; | &quot;C-S-q&quot; | &quot;C-S-Q&quot; | &quot;C-\S-q&quot; | &quot;C-\S-Q&quot; | ...) &#x27;cmd-2) 
 and swapping the lines.
 I never manage to get the intended behaviour – it keeps translating the uppercase to lowercase or vice-versa. And sometimes it doesn&#x27;t – there seems to be no pattern.
 Could someone help me out?

                              <span>I&#x27;m losing my mind over emacs as a python IDE. It seems that no matter which LSP concept I attempt, the experience is suboptimal. At best it is riddled with odd issues, and at worst almost bordering unusable.
 I work as a python developer, and I work on quite large code bases. The LSP experience is essential for me given the complexity, but I&#x27;m at the point of giving up, even though I&#x27;ve been an emacs user for the better part of a decade.
 I use doom emacs, by the way, but I&#x27;m quite happy to try anything to solve this. I have considered to build an emacs config from scratch again to see if I can narrow down the experience, but right now I have not invested the time. But again, considering how frustrated and desparate I am, everything is on the table.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;m currently using doom emacs with eglot. And I&#x27;m quite happy of how lightweight it is. However, I&#x27;m only able to see the diagnostics message when hovering the cursor over some error.
 I wonder if there is any similar package or eglot configuration to replicate what Error Lens does in vscode? Thank you in advance.
 My config looks as follows, I&#x27;d kindly appreciate any suggestion that could help me to improve my eglot experience:
 (use-package! eglot :defer t :init (setq eglot-autoshutdown t) :config (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilities &#x27;(:hoverProvider :documentLinkProvider :inlayHintProvider :documentOnTypeFormattingProvider)) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(rust-mode &quot;rust-analyzer&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(scala-mode &quot;metals&quot;)) (add-hook &#x27;eglot-managed-mode-hook (lambda () (flymake-mode -1))) :hook ((rjsx-mode rust-mode typescript-mode js2-mode scala-mode) . eglot-ensure))

                              <span>Monoid is a monoid in Hask (-&gt;), with a unit () and a pair as the tensor.
 Moniod &#x3D; MonoidalOf (-&gt;) () (,) 
 It is famous that Monad is a monoid in the (~&gt;) category
  
&quot;A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, ..&quot;
  
with the Identity functor as unit and functor composition as a tensor.
 What is less well-known is that Applicative is a similar monoid with a different tensor.
 Monad &#x3D; MonoidalOf (~&gt;) Identity Compose Applicative &#x3D; MonoidalOf (~&gt;) Identity Day 
 These are explained in &quot;Notions of Computation as Monoids&quot;: https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/pubs/Notions_of_Computation_as_Monoids.pdf.
 Here is a compilation I have made of other monoid typeclasses, I haven&#x27;t seen a more complete list elsewhere. I put the focus on structuring them clearly to elucidate the pattern.

                              <span>I tried looking at org-ql and found it to be a little overcomplicated for my more limited use cases.
 I felt like something simpler should exist, so I&#x27;m thinking of creating a mini query language that can be used to reference specific notes.
 Some examples:
 mynotes.org/0 -- grab first note in mynotes.org, a file in the current directory.
 /0/0 - grab first note of the first note of the current file.
 ../sibling note -- subnote of parent of current note with title &quot;sibling note&quot;.
 /0/0/1 -- relative to current file, 2nd note of the first subnote of the first subnote.
 ./0/1 -- 2nd subnote of the first subnote relative to current note.
 ../0/0 -- 1st subnote of the first subnote relative to the 
 The query function would have &quot;find one&quot; and &quot;find all&quot; functions. find one would fail if there were 0 or 2+ results.
 This query language would be focused around the following needs:
  
Ability to straightforwardly pass a reference to a note from one command line app that reads org mode to another.
 Ability to programmatically reference one note from another by relative or absolute location. There are some command line applications I&#x27;d like to build around org mode which would need something like this.
 Simplicity. I could add all sorts of bells and whistles to this but it would overburden it.
  
The other idea I had was to just use xpath but apply it to org mode. xpath is well known but I think it&#x27;s not so well liked, and the above queries would be possible but a lot more gnarly.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Bad idea?

 I posted this benchmark in the rust and golang subreddits some time ago and the community made suggestions that sped up the code...so I thought it&#x27;d be fair to post it here to get some feedback.
 nb: This is my first time writing scala.

                              <span>I came across an issue using Emacs when switching to a wayland compositor (hyprland).
 The fonts don&#x27;t look right as you can see at the screenshot below, but zooming in makes it better.
 My current emacs build is using LUCID no PGTK.
 I&#x27;m thinking of building another Emacs build with PGTK support that runs natively on Wayland without Xwayland. However i&#x27;d like to install them both.
 As i use Lucid version on XMonad most the time, but still when i switching to wayland i could still have a better font.

                              <span>I use doom emacs, and while I love the default purple / blue / orange - I fancy a change and wonder what synthwave themes are out there?
 Do recommend your favourites!
 So far I&#x27;ve seen:
 ​
  
the port of the VScode Synthwave &#x27;84 theme - though: 
 not noob friendly as it&#x27;s not in doom-themes
 seems to not have the extra-cool glow effect (no idea how to achieve that on emacs)
 
 the doom-themes port of laserwave
  
Any others I should consider?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s any way to make a variable automatically save its old value, so that I can, e.g., write a minor mode that will automatically restore the old values of variables when it&#x27;s deactivated (without having to declare a bunch of -old-value variables).

 Warning: Unknown type: proper-list

 (cl-check-type &#x27;(a b) (satisfies proper-list-p))

 Is anyone aware, if this is intended behavior?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a noob (of nearly 3 years using emacs).
 Buffer / window management still confuses me.
 I haven&#x27;t really learned to use / position / switch windows and buffers. Simply because I used to one org-mode window most of the time.
 Now I&#x27;m using org-roam, amd dealing with multiple small files, I keep getting stuck in silly situations, like ending up with:
  
a roam buffer and my fallback buffer vertically stacked - when I want to &quot;fullscreen&quot; the window with the roam buffer, I can&#x27;t delete or kill the fallback window / buffer.
 
two fallback buffers vertically stacked. Neither of which I can kill or delete.
 
 Is there a good guide somewhere?

                              <span>Just in case someone else also stumbles over this: Somewhere between 27.1 and 29.1, the behavior of format-spec has changed, when the substitution is a symbol.
 Prior to upgrading to from 27.1 to 29.1, invocations
 (format-spec &quot;Hello %a!&quot; &#x27;((a . world))) 
 would evaluate to the string
 &quot;Hello world!&quot; 
 As of 29.1, the behavior depends on whether a function is bound to world: If no function is bound to world&#x27;, the same result as in 27.1 will be obtained, but if a function is bound toworld&#x27;, it will be invoked without arguments, and the return value will be used instead of the symbol name.
 This has bitten me in my &#x60;.emacs&#x27;, where I had code using 
 (format-spec &quot;[...] &#x60;%s-p&#x27; [...]&quot; &#x60;(... (?s . ,type-name) ...)) 
 to generate a doc-string, and got an unexpected error
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (1 . 1) 0) 
 upon start-up, due to a function some-type-p being called without arguments under the new behavior, instead of interpolating it as symbol-name.
 Order of execution
 This was especially confusing, due to the introduction of a dependence on the order of execution. E.g. create a file /tmp/test.el with contents 
 ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*- (format-spec &quot;Hello %s!&quot; &#x27;((?s . foo-p))) (defun foo-p (obj) t) (princ &quot;Done.\n&quot;) 
 then 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el Done. 
 but
 &gt;&gt;&gt; emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el --load /tmp/test.el Wrong number of arguments: ((t) (obj) t), 0 Done. Error: wrong-number-of-arguments (((t) (obj) t) 0) mapbacktrace(#f(compiled-function (evald func args flags) #)) debug-early-backtrace() debug-early(error (wrong-number-of-arguments ((t) (obj) t) 0)) foo-p() format-spec(&quot;Hello %s!&quot; ((115 . foo-p))) eval-buffer(# nil &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) load(&quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) command-line-1((&quot;--load&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; &quot;--load&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot;)) command-line() normal-top-level()

                              <span>Hi
 I managed to setup lsp and java for emacs. I can compile and all works fine.
 I set compile command in init.el to run javac and java command so I see the result, as below.
 (setq compile-command &quot;javac YourJavaFileName.java &amp;&amp; java YourJavaClass&quot;)
 For now I have to replace &quot;YourJavaClass&quot; with current class. Can anyone help me to automatically pass currently opened class name to that command, please?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Is there some way to make visual-line-mode more smart about line-breaks? As depicted in fig.1, visual-line-mode doesn&#x27;t really handle overly-long lines (e.g. due to URLs) well. Disabling it entirely makes a bad overall trade-off in files containing mostly textual lines (fig.2).
 It could improve by allowing line-breaks on some non-whitespace characters (like &quot;-&quot; or &quot;/&quot;) or simply disabling visual-line-mode entirely for &quot;words&quot; that anyway need more than one line. Better yet, for any word exceeding a maximum character-length (e.g. 50) in order to better handle lines containing a few words, but also a moderately long URL (e.g. when using the markdown syntax [link name](link url)).
 I&#x27;ve found no existing options in the M-x customize interface, nor any relevant packages in M-x package-list-packages (including MELPA).
 Fig.1 When breaking long \&quot;words\&quot; like URLs, visual-line-mode is not very smart about where to break the lines.
 Fig.2 For URLs, having no visual-line-mode line breaks active would be preferable, but the disadvantage of disabling visual-line-mode for lines with actual text is too big to just disable visual-line-mode entirely.

 It would be great to use dekstop save mode without saving/restoring frame postion and size.
 I am aware of desktop-restore-frames but unlike it&#x27;s name, at least on Emacs 29, setting this to #f also doesn&#x27;t restore tab configuration and window layouts what I don&#x27;t want.

                              <span>Are there any existing plaintext file format to for storing discussion forums posts like this one or ubuntuforums. I want to archive the discussion I like locally. i have been using singlefilez for download the whole page into my machine, but i prefer plaintext formats. When I tried Org-web-tools, it does not seem to properly extract reddit discussion pages for example.
 I suppose I can write a scraper and dump content in json format. I&#x27;d prefer a plaintext format like org-mode and was designed with some thought put into this, instead of me cobbling something together.

                              <span>Introduction to Erules Library: A Practical Guide
 Erules is a lightweight, simple, and functional Scala library for rule evaluation. In this article, we will explore how to use this library to define and evaluate rules efficiently. Follow step-by-step for a detailed and hands-on understanding of use cases.
 What is Erules?
 Erules is a library that provides a rule evaluation engine in Scala. It is designed to be straightforward, typed, and functional, leveraging the power of Cats core. With Erules, you can define rules clearly and evaluate them on various data types concisely.
 Step 1: Import the Library
 To get started, add Erules as a dependency to your Scala project. You can do this in the build.sbt file with the following declaration:

                              <span>Using optparse-applicative I&#x27;m trying construct a parser that collects everything after the first argument into a list of strings. My goal is to write a tool that wraps another tool, adding a few commands and passing all unknown commands on.
 I&#x27;d hoped to find that strArgument would take anything and turn it into a string, i.e. that something like this would work:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; main :: IO () main &#x3D; do execParser optParser &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print
 data Opts &#x3D; OptFoo String [String] deriving (Show)
 optParser &#x3D; info (fall  helper) fullDesc where fall &#x3D; OptFoo  strArgument (metavar &quot;CMD&quot;  help &quot;git command&quot;)  many (strArgument mempty) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It works nicely for ordinary arguments:
  ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly OptFoo &quot;baz&quot; [&quot;silly&quot;] 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work with options
 &#x60;&#x60; ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly foo --bar Invalid option--bar&#x27;
 Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and it also picks up --help
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly --help Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD
 Available options: CMD git command -h,--help Show this help text &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I suspect optparse-applicative simply wasn&#x27;t written with this use case in mind and I&#x27;m failing to see any way of writing such a parser. Is there a way to do this using optparse-applicative, or should I look at other option/argument parsing packages?

                              <span>tl;dr - see Question below
 Background / my setup
 So I&#x27;ve used a GTD-like setup in org-mode for a few years now. I&#x27;m very much still a noob.
 One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I&#x27;m making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).
 For example, I&#x27;d write something like the below and need to type &quot;Big/Small Important Work Project&quot; a number of times with my big fat fingers:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ** Big Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project
 ** Small Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (Note, I don&#x27;t actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)
 In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone 
 I therefore get tasks like &quot;call amit&quot; or &quot;book room&quot; a lot, devoid of context.
 Question:
 Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children? Maybe appended to them?
 I realise this is not nessecarily an Org, or emacs, problem but I hope I can solve it programatically in emacs.

                              <span>For those interested, I just released orgmunge version 0.2.0 (GitHub, PyPi). This version will attempt to parse the TODO keywords specified in the input file/text if they exist; otherwise, it lets you flexibly specify the TODO keywords as an argument to the parser or via a local file.

                              <span>I read the documentation of using MTL library but I would love some more examples to work this through. Say that I have Haskell code looking like:
 haskell foo :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; State Int () foo global local | local &gt;&#x3D; 10 &#x3D; put 100 | otherwise &#x3D; do if (ord local) &#x60;elem&#x60; global then do put (local) foo global (local + 1) else do return () 
 Note: This program means absolutely nothing. This is a very basic structure of a program I am working on. As you see that the first parameter is a read-only global variable which I wish to abstract out in a Reader monad. I know I have to work with StateT.
  newType State s m a &#x3D; State { runStateT :: (s -&gt; m (s, a)) } -- where m is the inner monad 
 My understanding is that I should change my function signature to:
  foo :: Int -&gt; StateT Int (Reader String ()) foo &#x3D; undefined -- I don&#x27;t know how to implement this 
 Can someone please help me with this?

                              <span>How do I use the fixed-pitch font for math fragments in org-mode buffers? I.e., I want to use a monospace font for all strings of the form \(...\) or \[...\], where ... may include newline characters as well, as is common for equations written in math display mode. 
 I&#x27;m an Emacs newb, so the best I could come up with was a regex-based font-lock:
 (progn (setq-local font-lock-keywords &#x60;((,(rx (group (or &quot;\\[&quot; &quot;\\(&quot;) (zero-or-more anything) (or &quot;\\]&quot; &quot;\\)&quot;))) (1 &#x27;fixed-pitch)))) (font-lock-fontify-buffer)) 
 And then running this on an org-mode-hook.
 But this is definitely wrong. Not only does it remove all the nice org-mode styling applied to things like section headers, but it&#x27;s also applying the fixed-pitch font to more than just the intended math fragments, suggesting issues with the regex at least.

 - transient menus
 - asynchronous process calls
 Overall: more accessible a much faster, less resource intensive. Thanks for all feedback in the last days, that helped me bring it forward!

 idk what these icons symbolise i don&#x27;t want any lavish gif as icons but these icons just don&#x27;t make sense to me is there any font pack i have to modify or do i have to modify any icons file contents
 i want to patch this issue i&#x27;m just annoyed with this issue at this point i have been using this since last two years i didn&#x27;t care much to resolve this but now it&#x27;s just annoying
 i did nerd-icons-install-fonts to install fonts in my computer i even did something else to set fonts i don&#x27;t remember what it was

                              <span>Eglot is a lot more bare-bones than lsp-mode – leaving &#x27;UI chrome&#x27; to external packages that can work generically with emacs&#x27; existing ecosystem (flymake/eldoc/etc.) – and this generally works for me. Making similar migrations in my config has worked out very well – notably to use vertico family of packages for completions.
 Are there packages you like that provide additional chrome on what eglot makes available? I&#x27;m particularly interested in project diagnostics from flymake, but I&#x27;m curious to see what else folks have come across.

                              <span>Is there some package in Emacs, that works as a web server, that can be used for testing the project, that you are currently working on?
 For example, I have a project folder, that&#x27;s currently opened in Emacs with html, css and js files is there a package, that will run a web server on the project&#x27;s working path.
 I mean, it&#x27;s possible to just open files on the web browser, but, there are situations in HTML5, that are prohibited without using web server, i.e. AJAX and WebSocket and some other technologies. Also, if you use local version (not the web server), you cannot use absolute paths to files in the project, because they will differ from those on the web server.

                              <span>Hello, I was wondering, if Emacs has an ability or some package, that will allow me to open resources, being referenced from the source code, i.e., let&#x27;s say, I have an html file with code:
 
 
 
  
   Next page  
 
 
 ---
 I would like to be able to click, or use some hot key, while cursor being over urls, in this case: &quot;style.css&quot;, &quot;script.js&quot; and &quot;page2.html&quot;, and it would open that document for editing or, if the document&#x27;s file doesn&#x27;t exist, it would open an empty file with such name.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m looking for a package to manage bookmarks for inside Emacs.
 I&#x27;ve tried the built-in functionality but the configuration contains a lot of junk which makes it hard to manage and share between machines.
 With junk I mean information besides configuration such as time last changed.
 Configuration what any configuration is, the individual bookmark with title location and so on.

 I present to you kickstart.emacs.
 A starting point for Gnu Emacs with good defaults, vim keybindings and packages that most people may want to use without needing to watch hours of tutorial videos to get started.
 One of the project goals is to become something like kickstart.nvim.
 Or, to be a reference if someone doesn&#x27;t know how to do something.
 I would appreciate any feedback.
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>I have this type of code in my init.el each loads the features in a directly and it turns out that because the file names contained the - character they were not being loaded, as the regex checks for only alphanumeric filenames which are not hidden.
 (let ((default-directory (expand-file-name &quot;wsi/lisp&quot; user-emacs-directory))) (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path (directory-files default-directory nil &quot;[^\\.][a-z0-9]*&quot;))) 
 By the way I copied this from someone&#x27;s init.el and I&#x27;ve suffered from it for ages, an object lesson on how one should not copy init.el files and other Emacs lisp code without fully understanding the code in them.
 I&#x27;m not sure but it looks like the regex will not even match file names with capitals in them.
 I guess the question I want to ask is how to add arbitrary non-alphabetical characters to a regex matching alphanumeric characters, with the proviso that they are acceptable in file names..

                              <span>i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need elisp as i&#x27;m using emacs distribution
 i want to learn basics elisp so that i can understand how to map keys how to send commands etc.
 constructs that all beginners require
 please don&#x27;t send a 300 page pdf for elisp as i don&#x27;t want to learn everything i just want a basic max 10 page rulebook for elisp 
 ​
 my teacher told me to use emacs and i love the experience so far thanks to the support from this community
 i have not yet learned how to execute command like 
 menu-bar--display-line-numbers-mode-relative
 i don&#x27;t know how to 
 run tab-width command with and set it to 4 after using M-x to open dialogue box to run command
 (i think it&#x27;s called buffer not dialogue box)
 ​
 so this is the level i&#x27;m at not much i know but i hope that emacs gods help me in finding true peace

                              <span>Hey there,
 I ve been experimenting with Monads. Then i realized (-&gt; a) is a Monad (that made me so happy and made the monads more accesible somehow ).
 Today i started to play with Comonads. My intuition was like hmm probably (-&gt; * a) is a Comonad. I wasnt sure how to express that in Haskell. Also :i Comonad only showed ((,) e).
 Before giving up though i tried the Comonad functions on types of (-&gt; a)They worked !
 λ&gt;&#x3D; extend (\x -&gt; x [1 ,2 ] ) length [10] 3 it :: Int λ&gt;&#x3D; extract (++[10]) [10] it :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; [a] λ&gt;&#x3D; duplicate (++[10]) [1] [2] [1,2,10] it :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; [a] 
 Could someone explain how it works please?

 Just found and installed it and it works great. You only need an API Key from Open AI.

                              <span>Could you recommend themes (dark or light) with warm green background? The closest one to what I&#x27;m looking for is Robin Hood. Organic Green, Shaman, and Kingsajz are too blueish for my taste. And most other &quot;green&quot; themes only use green as foreground colour.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have encountered an oddity preventing me from using DooM EMacs on my work Intel MacBook Pro (Linux user at home). 
 I installed Doom EMacs from the official GitHub page using Homebrew emacs-mac package. 
 Conditions:
  
If I open a file using the Mac terminal &#x60;emacs test.org’ then 2 instances of DooM EMacs will instantiate. 1) that is of the document I requested, and 2) a DooM Emacs home screen. 
 
If I click an icon through the Mac finder then all works as expect. 
 
If I create a zsh or bash shell script with emacs test.org and execute then the script will hang.
 
 My .zsh looks as so:  alias emacs&#x3D;&#x27;open /Applications/EMacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs&#x27; 
 Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been acquainting myself with Emacs (vanilla) and am currently reading through the tutorial. I&#x27;m at the part about creating new frames and, as you can see on the image, the new frame shows up small and squished. This also happens sometimes when opening Emacs regularly. I doubt that is intended. I have not found any topics related to this behaviour (maybe my google-fu is just bad). Anyone encounter this before and have a potential fix? I don&#x27;t have an init file yet and I&#x27;m on Fedora if that helps.
 Edit: Just now realised reddit didn&#x27;t include the image, don&#x27;t know how to do it afterwards, but &quot;solved&quot; anyway.

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I decided to learn Org mode recently, and wanted to add some of my custom vim keybindings to Doom emacs, but there are two keybindings i have problem with.
 The first one being with avy where i want to use &quot;s&quot; in normal mode to start the search. But this isnt working:
 (map! :after evil :n &quot;s&quot; &#x27;avy-goto-char-2)
 I have similiar syntax with other binds and they work. I added &quot;:after evil&quot; since that was a suggestion in another reddit thread i found
 Another binding i want to add is to make &quot;C-d&quot; act as &quot;C-d-z-z&quot; (I want to have the current functionality of vim/emacs, but center the text when i scroll) Any ideas on how i can achieve this?

                              <span>I have been using Magit and Forge for several years, mainly with projects on self-hosted Gitlab instances. The experience has been great!
 One of the nice things that Forge did for me was showing the numbers of merge requests (in !123 form) in my magit-log views. Some time ago, however, this stopped working. Actually, this stopped working quite some time ago, maybe a year or more. I was too lazy to report it and too busy to investigate. IIRC it didn&#x27;t stop working right away for all repos, so I guess it is not related to e.g. upgrading to Emacs 28 (and it was definitely before I upgraded to Emacs 29.1). 
 To investigate this in more detail, I created new clones of several projects, but that didn&#x27;t change anything. I also tried a simplified Emacs config in a new home directory to make sure that Forge&#x27;s database was created from scratch. Same problem persists. 
 On Forge&#x27;s Github pages, I found some references to interactions of Forge with bug-reference-mode, so maybe it somehow has to do with that? On the other hand, given that I used a fresh Emacs config + new clones, I guess this isn&#x27;t the cause of the issue either. 
 Does anyone know how to get the MR numbers back in Magit&#x27;s log view?

                              <span>Here&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t figure out: When using dired to manage files, let&#x27;s say I have a top level directory with a ton of subdirectories, each with a GoPro video inside (unique name/time/date for each file name). How do I move them all at once to that top level directory for easier management/renaming? I don&#x27;t want to have to go into each directory and move them one at a time with R. Let&#x27;s say all of the files are MP4 or HEVC.

                              <span>I am a Neovim user, and I am trying out Emacs.
 I recently started with doom emacs, it feels pretty good. However, one issue I am facing is that pyright works very slow. I know that it is an issue with pyright, which I faced with Neovim also.
 However, I made it faster for my use-case by changing some settings. Neovim allows to have these settings in the setup function for LSP. I was trying to figure out how do I change these settings with doom emacs. Pyright docs suggest to have these settings in pyrightconfig.json.
 I think this is more of a pyright issue, but feel like somebody might have already solved it.

 PlantUML works as expected when generating images, for instance:
 :file *.png
 The problem is, there is no ASCII generated in results: verbatim mode:
 :results verbatim
 png generated in RESULTS instead of expected ASCII text. What could go wrong?
 The same problem observed here: https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/problem-with-plantuml-src-block-results/3603
 According to this article:
 https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-plantuml.html
 there seems to be no reason why this should not work.
 UPDATE:
 The docs appear to be somewhat outdated or smth is not correctly setup. I&#x27;ve found that specifying a :file .txt actually allows to generate ASCII in a text file. The only question is: how to preview it in the org-mode now? 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +begin_src plantuml :file ascii.txt
 Bob -&gt; Alice : Hello World!
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 [[file:ascii.txt]]

I use parallel compilation in Cabal and Nix, and I split my projects into smaller sub-packages already, and unless I get a decent compilation time improvement for M3 Max over M2, I&#x27;d prefer keeping a lighter and smaller M2 Air for now and maybe wait for another iteration.
 Has anyone been lucky to test that new chip in a compilation-heavy environment already?

                              <span>A recent post got me thinking about how we might go about extracting nested optional values with the convenience of Kotlin and TypeScript, but while still leveraging Scala&#x27;s rich monadic types. Odersky&#x27;s comment on another post indicated a way to reproduce a version of the ? syntax using Scala&#x27;s boundary/break. His example works only with A | Null values, however. I wanted to see if I could accomplish the same while:
  
Supporting ? on any optional/failable type,
 Preserving failure types by returning an Either and tracking any failure types encountered in the get chain, and
 Still avoid any intermediate allocations (only construct the Either at the end)
  
You can see my attempt in this gist
 The syntax is:
 val result: Either[F1 | F2 | F3, A] &#x3D; getEither(obj1.?.obj2.?.obj3) 
 Where F1, F2, and F3 are the failure types of obj1, obj2, and obj3. Option fails with Unit, Try fails with Throwable, and Either fails with its left type.
 I&#x27;m doubtful I&#x27;d ever actually use this: having to a) import &#x60;getEither&#x60; and &#x60;?&#x60;, b) wrap the statement in &#x60;getEither&#x60;, and c) add a dot before each &#x60;?&#x60; seems like just a little more would make me skip the usual syntax, but it was fun and interesting to work out how to do it. I&#x27;d be curious to hear others&#x27; thoughts.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Along similar lines, it occurred to me that you could produce an implementation of Option that has no allocation overhead. You can check out my attempt at that here. It just uses A | Null under the hood as an opaque type. It&#x27;s two limitations that I know of are:
  
toString does not show None or Some(x) but null and x (this is just a limitation of opaque types)
 I can&#x27;t figure out a way to implement exhaustive extractors. Instead, you can use the fold method (which I&#x27;ve been using more and more these days anyways)

It&#x27;s a couple of minutes long, but beware: it&#x27;s in German.  🇩🇪
Nothing of interest about the Zettelkasten, I&#x27;d say, just a short bio. So you don&#x27;t miss out if you don&#x27;t understand a word.</span>

                              <span>Hello there .
 I am using as my OS devuan gnu+linux .
 The point is I like philosophy of Unix using like tmux + nvim + mutt .
 and I love the vi keybings so much .. 
 Sometimes I am thinking to switch to gnu emacs .. but I feel that I will find some difficulties
 and I am afraid . 
 Is there a easy way to use emacs ?
 can someone help or give me some YT videos to watch to have a good idea about emacs ?

I need to collaborate on some notes with a Vim user. It&#x27;d be nice if there were some tools in Vim that they could use to navigate Denote-formatted Markdown files as easily as I can. Does anyone know of a Vim plugin that works with Denote?

                              <span>Hi Everyone.
 I&#x27;m using emacs and ripgrep to find what I&#x27;m looking for in a folder. Ripgrep shows the result of what I&#x27;m looking beautifully. Thats great. Every time I open a result, ripgrep buffer disappears. 
 Does anyone know how to open a temp buffer to view result then I can close it and go back to rg result again, so I don&#x27;t have to type my search query.
 Thanks.

Now when (while still being in agenda) I do switch buffer among the options I see are the org agenda files. I don’t want that.
 If I ever want to see them I will open them explicitly (not want to see them when they were opened automatically by agenda)

                              <span>I want to be able to use outline-minor-mode to fold my use-package blocks at convenient points. Ideally, I want to be able to fold sections following :config, :init, :custom, etc. as well as definitions inside those blocks. The current value of outline-regexp when in emacs-lisp-mode is: 
 &quot;;;;;* [^ \n]\\|(\\|\\(^;;;###\\(\\([-[:alnum:]]+?\\)-\\)?\\(autoload\\)\\)&quot; 
 I thought appending \\|[[:space:]]*:\\(init|config|custom\\) to this would work, but it doesn&#x27;t. Any help would be much appreciated. 
 (I see there&#x27;s a related post here, but I didn&#x27;t find anything there that helped me.)

                              <span>When checking the weather for different locations in org-babel, I encountered an issue where the symbol for partly cloudy was not displayed correctly. Here is the code I used: 
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output curl &#x27;wttr.in/{Paris,SanJose,Washington}?format&#x3D;4&#x27; #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : Paris: 🌧 🌡️+10°C 🌬️↗9km/h : SanJose: ☀️ 🌡️+16°C 🌬️↘15km/h : Washington: ⛅️ 🌡️+12°C 🌬️↓4km/h 
 The symbol of partly-cloudy in washington was not rendered:

 I&#x27;m currently using Emacs 29.1 on Windows 10, and have set the symbol fonts as &quot;&quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot; which does have symbol of partly-cloudy.
 (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot; nil &#x27;prepend) 
 I alterntively tried &quot;Symbola&quot; font but the issue repeats. How could solve the problem?

I know that I can use the linter with an after-save-hook, but is there any other solutions with flycheck or lsp integrations? (I tried flycheck-clang-tidy but I didn&#x27;t get any warrings or indicators, not sure if clang-tidy can detect them though)

I understand enough to know that this might not be possible for all haskell programs, but if I understand correctly it is a step in the CLASH compiler which supports a very large portion of the language (libraries no, but language yes). I am aware of various pragmas to direct GHC to attempt to do this in specific places, but is there anything like this available in the GHC libraries?

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the latest release of mig-0.2 library. It is a library to write composable servers for simple / boring haskell. The main focus of this release is the ability to serve Swagger UI from the server with ease and ability to create clients from the same code as servers. I&#x27;m happy to confirm that both goals are reached with this release. 
 The tutorial for library was created.
 Also there are many other improvements:
  
OpenApi schema for servers
 swagger servers support (we can add swagger to server with one line of code: withSwagger def server )
 clients from the same code as servers
 redesign of internal types
 redesign of DSL for routes
 many ergonomic improvements
 packages for extra utils
 split of mig package to several packages: 
 mig - core
 mig-wai - rendering servers to wai apps
 mig-client - clients
 mig-extra - extra utils
 mig-server - mig servers with batteries
 mig-swagger-ui - swagger ui server
 
 tutorial and quickstart guide on github pages
 CI for repo with formatter, build and tests and update of docs on github pages
  
The internal type for Servers was redesigned so that we assemble handler function with API description at the same time. In the first release it was just handler function under the hood.
 As a refresher mig is a family of libraries to write lightweight, simple, type-safe and composable servers. It strives to be in the middle ground between scotty and servant. To be composable, flexible and type-safe as servant and simple and lightweight in concepts as scotty.
 Thanks to Ambros for contribution. Also I&#x27;d like to thank authors of packages servant, servant-swagger-ui and servant-openapi3 packages for inspiration for my work in this release. Many lines of code are influenced by those packages.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.17 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This release introduces compatibility with what4 versions up to 1.5.1, and replaces several functions in copilot-core. The second change is a breaking change: the functions replaced have been deprecated and new alternatives introduced instead.
 As always, we&#x27;re releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Jan 7th, 2024.
 In our last announcement, we mentioned that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-libraries and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].
 There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We&#x27;ll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m pulling out my hair trying to figure this out. I don&#x27;t have much experience with the advanced Haskell features (Lenses, constrained type variables) they&#x27;re using in this library so I need halp.
 I&#x27;m trying to write a ToParamSchema instance for a type that will be documented in swagger (link). This is my code:
 instance ToParamSchema DeprSchedule where toParamSchema _ &#x3D; let dollarSchema &#x3D; toSchema (Proxy :: Proxy Dollar) daySchema &#x3D; toSchema (Proxy :: Proxy Day) in mempty &amp; type_ ?~ SwaggerArray &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] 
 When I try to compile, I get this huge error
 src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:357:15: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘t’ with ‘&#x27;Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKindSchema’ arising from a functional dependency between: constraint ‘Data.Swagger.Lens.HasItems (ParamSchema t) (Maybe (SwaggerItems &#x27;Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKindSchema))’ arising from a use of ‘items’ instance ‘Data.Swagger.Lens.HasItems (ParamSchema t1) (Maybe (SwaggerItems t1))’ at  ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: toParamSchema :: forall (t :: Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKind (*)). Proxy DeprSchedule -&gt; ParamSchema t at src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:351:5-17 • In the first argument of ‘(?~)’, namely ‘items’ In the second argument of ‘(&amp;)’, namely ‘items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema]’ In the expression: mempty &amp; type_ ?~ SwaggerArray &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] • Relevant bindings include toParamSchema :: Proxy DeprSchedule -&gt; ParamSchema t (bound at src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:351:5) | 357 | &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] | ^^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded. 
 Plz help, I have no idea what to do with this error.

                              <span>I made a function to check whether a number is divisible only by 2, 3, or 5. After some modifications this is the current form:
 isHammingF :: Integer -&gt; Bool isHammingF number | number  Integer -&gt; Bool recur 1 _ &#x3D; True recur n i | i &gt; 5 &#x3D; False | n &#x60;mod&#x60; i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; recur (n &#x60;div&#x60; i) i | otherwise &#x3D; recur n (i + 1) 
 I based this function from its Kotlin counterpart:
 fun Int.isHammingF(): Boolean { val number &#x3D; abs(this) tailrec fun recur(number: Int, i: Int): Boolean &#x3D; if (i &gt; 5) false else if (number % i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) recur(number / i, i) else recur(number, i + 1) return if (number &lt; 8) number in 1..6 else recur(number, 2) } 
 I&#x27;m trying to make the function easy to translate in the two languages. However, some things are getting in the way:
  
How do I make the value of parameter number absolute? In Kotlin, I just have to make a new variable that holds the absolute value of the parameter in a line, making it more ‘step to step’. But in Haskell, I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s possible to do that in functions.
 Why does when I remove the recur 1 _ &#x3D; True line from the Haskell code, it only evaluate 1–6 as true? I tried to make a list of numbers 1–256, filtered using this function with recur 1 _ &#x3D; True removed, and the result is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. If it were correct, it should still produce [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,…, 250, 256]. I also tried to change it into recur 5 _ &#x3D; True or other numbers, and the resulting list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,…] followed by Hamming numbers divisible by that number. What is recur 1 _ &#x3D; True really? How to remove it if it&#x27;s okay to?
  
Any help is appreciated.

 Elm-like ScalaJS Calculator App
 Hey there,
 I wanted to share my recent experiment with ScalaJS and frontend development. Despite I use Scala for a long time, I don&#x27;t know shit about frontend development. Still, Elm&#x27;s simplicity got me thinking - maybe some of its principles could work in Scala too. So I made a basic calculator app written in ScalaJS and using Tyrian.
 Hope you dig it! Feel free to drop your thoughts.
 Best,

 Can someone help me understand why this is necessary?

As a programmer, you have to constantly be asking, “How Good is my Code?”. There are a lot of different ways code can be “good” or “bad”, but one of the key indicators in many cases is the time performance of your code. How long does it take your code to run…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
A few years ago, I started to take daily note and take a lot, but at the end of a day, I have difficulty on how to deal with those notes.
The major problem is, I can&#x27;t decide the size of a note derived from my daily note.
Say, I take a note like &quot;5 students have sent me the language test invoice regarding applying for an academic reward. In my understanding, this could be directly put into &quot;Academic Reward&quot; or &quot;Things related to Academic Reward for Language Test&quot;. But if I do so, I feel guilty because it looks not even a bit like a Zettel systems.
I heard a lot of so-called atomic notes, but I never really see a real-world, down-to-earth workflow of authentic zettel.</span>

                              <span>While working for a Tweag client, improving and optimizing their Bazel build system, the client gave us a side quest: Enable their CI pipeline to produce regular and complete coverage reports with Testwell CTC++ — a code coverage tool from Verifysoft. This article explains how we integrated Testwell CTC++ coverage testing into their Bazel build system.
Integrating coverage testing with Testwell CTC++ into a project that builds with Bazel has its own unique challenges. We navigated the combination of these two tools to provide a solution that was a good fit for our client.

The mismatch between Bazel’s built-in coverage support and CTC++
As described in its documentation, Bazel does include some support for code coverage reports, however, it is relatively limited and inflexible, only suppor…</span>

                              <span>When I run emacs -nw (Emacs 29.1) in an iterm2 window on a MacBook Pro, it does a decent job of rendering the theme colors. But if in the same window (outside of emacs) I ssh to a server (that has an identical init.el) and run the same, the colors are way off. I&#x27;m looking for advice (beyond &quot;use TRAMP&quot;) for how to get better theme colors over ssh.
 In both cases the value of $TERM is xterm-256color. The output of msgcat --color&#x3D;test is the same in both shells. But in emacs the output of M-x list-color-display is quite different in the two cases: in the local window there are 556 colors with many descriptive names, but in the ssh context there are 256 colors with limited names (color-NNN for NNN in 16 through 255).

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 the title already is quite specific, so I&#x27;ll just try to explain a bit more.
 I use &#x60;text-mode-hook&#x60; to activate &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60; when I am in an org-mode buffer. This approach works quite alright, but I am struggling to make it work with another recent addition to my workflow, &#x60;desktop.el&#x60;.
 I want to use &#x60;desktop&#x60; to save opened files, window and tab bar configurations. After some tinkering this also works out fine, however, when I use &#x60;desktop-read&#x60; on a constellation that contains org-mode buffers, it seems like darkroom-mode is applied twice, i.e. the font is even bigger than with normal &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60; applied.
 I have tried to use &#x60;desktop-after-read-hook&#x60; to re-initialize &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60;:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (defun or/re-initialize-darkroom ()
 (progn
 (darkroom-mode -1)
 (darkroom-mode +1)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, this does not seem to work, because the text still is oversized. If it were only for one tab or buffer where this is the case, I&#x27;d swallow that pill. However, it is the case in all org buffers, which is a tad too annoying with four tabs containing four different org files.
 Thus, I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences, maybe you&#x27;ve got a tip or two for me?
 Have a good day!

 My only issue is mostly aesthetic. I use EXWM and usually run kitty inside it because I like having my terminals have a different background color than my buffers. 
 Is it possible to have emacs color my Eat buffers differently than others? 
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>So my excitement at emacs on my Steamdeck was shortlived
 I rebooted the Steamdeck and Emacs won&#x27;t launch.
 This is a containerised install (with the app exported to the OS&#x27; launcher) on an immutable OS. I&#x27;m struggling (perhaps) because this is my first experience of either.
 I used the Steamdeck install guide on the distrobox wiki
 The only clues I have (apologies for the shorthand, I&#x27;m on my phone and my Steamdeck has no internet) are:
  
If I try to list my distrobox containers I get invalid internal status, try resetting the pause process with ... podman system migrate
 
If I try that command I get Error: could not find a working conman binary and then a list of (non home) paths.
 
 However, the path to conmon is correct in containers.conf
 Is distrobox looking for something (conmon) but I don&#x27;t have the location right in a config file somewhere?

When I use &#x60;rgrep&#x60; to search for occurences in buffers, which are already open, and use the mouse to jump to the matching buffer and occuence, point jumps to the closest visible occurence but doesn&#x27;t &quot;open&quot; details which are hidden because of outline mode.
 Is there a way to reveal the actually matching details?

                              <span>Dear emacs neckbeards, perspective-el (https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el) works really nice but there is some visual clutter because the indicator for the workspace names are visible in each window ( i know doom emacs doesn&#x27;t which is cleaner) , does someone has a solution please ? ( see in picture please )
 To be conicse i just want the workspace indicator e.g [main | second] to be displayed once, at the top left corner, and not 3 times in each window.

 edit: I found out, that the text &quot;[main|second]&quot; is on the header line of each window, controlled by the variable &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; header-line-format &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; which has the value (&quot;&quot; (:eval (persp-mode-line))) in my case.
 One idea would be to track the number of windows in the current workspace with window-list, 
 if it is greated then 2 -&gt; add a hook to every new created window in the workspace and set the variable &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; header-line-format &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; to nil, thus it should be empty, but sadly i dont have time for that at the moment.

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Training for my Centenarian Decathlon
I&#x27;m interested in adopting a &quot;gradient descent&quot; approach to help me systematically identify and explore the most relevant aspects of an idea&#x27;s structure.
I&#x27;m refactoring my ZK Dashboard and the Python programs that create it.
My class on Atmosphere Science is getting interesting as it comes to an end in a few weeks. I&#x27;m concentrating on the final project: a state application for a prescribed burn.
Today (November 8, 2023) is the 5th anniversary of my ZK with The Archive.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Attia, Peter and Gifford, Bill. Outlive: the science &amp; art of longevity. 2023.
Calvino, Italo. The road to San Giovanni. 1994.
Cowen, Tyler. GOAT: Who is the Greatest Economist of all Time and Why Does it Matter?. 2023.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Jeff Oster

 Any ideas how to get rid of them?
 I suggested a workaround using: 
  (defun my-python-completion-filter (completions) &quot;Filter out the unwanted &#x27;__PYTHON\_EL&#x27; from COMPLETIONS.&quot; (cl-remove-if (lambda (completion) (string-match-p &quot;__PYTHON_EL&quot; completion)) completions)) (advice-add &#x27;python-shell-completion-get-completions :filter-return #&#x27;my-python-completion-filter) 
 but I feel like I should better understand the exact source of the problem and have a more robust solution.

 It seems that the situation is just like one described in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnus-english/2014-02/msg00047.html
 After some debug, I found that GNUS just doesn&#x27;t apply any faces, so (get-text-property pos &#x27;face) returns nil for summary buffer.
 Now I&#x27;m not even sure where should I look for a clue: GNUS sources don&#x27;t seem to be changed much, the same GNUS works fine with emacs 28 and 27, so apparently it&#x27;s a change in emacs itself. Are there any obvious places to check?

 My current workaround is to copy from Emacs, paste in any other application (often Firefox), then copy from there, and finally paste in Brave.
 Has anyone else seen this behaviour? How do I change it?
 (I guess I&#x27;m hoping this is a Brave/Chrome problem, as Firefox handles it brilliantly, but I thought I&#x27;d ask here first as it&#x27;s only when I copy text from Emacs that this happens.)
 (Oh, and yes, unfortunately I do need to use a Chrome-based browser for work. Thank you Microsoft!)

                              <span>Has anyone seen any efforts to make emacs behave more similar to TextMate on macOS? The goal would be to make most keybindings work similar to not only TextMate, but generally accepted keyboard bindings for macOS as well as quitting/opening saving and restoring the &quot;desktop&quot; session saving functionality.
 This would be utilizing the railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport port via brew install emacs-mac --with-emacs-big-sur-icon --with-native-compilation --with-imagemagick --with-librsvg --with-mac-metal --with-starter

                              <span>Following a recent-ish complaint about how a double-width char looked in the popup, I now pushed a somewhat ambitious update to the Company popup&#x27;s rendering (the default, built-in frontend), to master.
 It should better co-habitate with such characters (inside the buffer and in completions) and with other advanced elements (larger text, small images, etc).
 Of course it&#x27;s still overlay-based, and some things are unchanged: e.g. how the text &quot;under&quot; it becomes devoid of certain elements like button decorations (when those are themselves created using overlays) and line numbers.

                              <span>Recently, many folks have been claiming that their Large Language Model (LLM) is the best at coding. Their claims are typically based off self-reported evaluations on the HumanEval benchmark. But when you look into that benchmark, you realize that it only consists of 164 Python programming problems.
 This led me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how helpful LLMs actually are with different programming, scripting, and markup languages. I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit. Below you will find what I have figured out about Scala so far.
 Do you have any feedback or perhaps some anecdotes about using LLMs with Scala to share?

                              <span>Recently, many folks have been claiming that their Large Language Model (LLM) is the best at coding. Their claims are typically based off self-reported evaluations on the HumanEval benchmark. But when you look into that benchmark, you realize that it only consists of 164 Python programming problems.
 This led me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how helpful LLMs actually are with different programming, scripting, and markup languages. I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit. Below you will find what I have figured out about Haskell so far.
 Do you have any feedback or perhaps some anecdotes about using LLMs with Haskell to share…</span>

                              <span>I was using magit normally, but it suddenly stopped working. Specifically I can&#x27;t commit files outside my home directory. Commits in home directory works file, but when committing a file on other partitions fails. Here is the error message:
  1 git … commit -- hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Not inside Git repository 
 With debug info on, here is the full debug message:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Setting ACL&quot; &quot;Operation not permitted&quot; &quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot;) set-file-acl(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) set-file-extended-attributes(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; ((acl . &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer-copy(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG&quot; &quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; 511 ((acl . &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer() basic-save-buffer-2() basic-save-buffer-1() basic-save-buffer(t) save-buffer(1) funcall-interactively(save-buffer 1) call-interactively(save-buffer nil nil) command-execute(save-buffer) 
 I&#x27;ve tried reinstalling emacs and magit, clearing the elpa directory and cache. I&#x27;m on linux. A thing to note is that it suddenly stopped working. A few hours ago it was working fine, but now it errors. I believe there is some permission error on other partitions, but can&#x27;t figure out what.
 Edit: The partition is NTFS formatted.
 Edit #2: The problem is almost certainly due to the partition beign NTFS. For now, I&#x27;ve switched to a ext4 partition.

                              <span>Hello. I am having some difficulty setting up my emacs to do spell check and offer the correct spelling when in LaTeX mode. 
 I currently have got emacs highlighting spelling errors correctly, but cannot get emacs to present the correct spelling for me. 
 I currently hide the tool bar as a like to use emacs mouse free in i3. I use GNU Emacs 28.2 on Debian. I currently only get spell check via :
 (add-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook &#x27;flyspell-mode)
 Does anyone have any advice on how to get emacs to present the correct spelling (ideally without a mouse) while in latex mode. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am not sure this is the right place to share the issue. But I found a bug with typing Korean characters that &quot;overwrite-mode&quot; is not actually working well. (For Japanese/Chinese characters, there is no issue at all.)
 aeoiu
 &#x3D;&gt; あえu
 &#x3D;&gt; 阿榜u
 &#x3D;&gt; 아에aeiou (not working)
 ​
 In the thread, one of the Japanese users reported a bug but it is not appropriate for Korean characters which requires a combination of sub-characters to make a character unlike other Japanese or Chinese characters.
  
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-05/msg00039.html
  
​
  
Is there anyone who has encountered and found a workaround for this? (I know there are a few Korean Emacs users... sadly.. )
 I guess I have to report this issue and try something to fix it. Where can I start with?

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import qttools
 def askPasswordDialog(): translator &#x3D; qttools.name_with_typo(language_code) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The package qttools is contained in the same folder/project. The function name_with_typo() does not exist in qttools. This cause an AttributeError when run with a Python interpreter.
 I do use Emacs 27 and 29 with eglot and flake8. The described error is not detected because eglot/flake do not look into the imported package if the function really exist in there.
 Can I fix this somehow?
 Beside of that tested flake8 on shell. It is also not able to detect such a problem.
 Not sure if I can improve the detection within my Emacs environment?

                              <span>Hi, I am using functions from u/daviwil including one adding any roam node containing TODO keywords to the list of agenda files. I see that I must have done something wrong, since I have more than 200 files in my variable org-agenda-files (nothing bad).
 Of course, I can select them one by one and remove them. But this problem lead me to wonder if there is a function in emacs that allows to create a Dired buffer out of a list of files (typically org-agenda-files), in order to be able to remove them if need be with the Dired functions (mark, delete)
 thanks for any info regarding this

                              <span>I just watched Haoyi’s Scala Days talk on his Mill build tool and it made me really want to give it a try. Has anyone here been using it recently? Any pitfalls I should be aware of? Is there a plug-in ecosystem (or whatever the Mill equivalent is) that would support most typical use cases without my having to roll my own? (I’m thinking like docker build, publishing to Sonatype, graal native image, etc.)
 Or to put it another way, what am I going to end up missing from sbt down the road if I switch to Mill?
 For those who haven’t seen the talk: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;UsXgCeU-ovI

                              <span>The idea is really simple - I think a major factor that makes type level programming (Edit: syntax within the type namespace) confusing for someone coming from the imperative world is that it shares so much syntax with value level programming (the value namespace). Obviously once you&#x27;ve learned it that&#x27;s really nice and clean, but before you have it can add a lot of confusion. So I came up with these custom instructions that I added to ChatGPT, and type level programming (the type namespace) instantly became much clearer.
 These instructions were generated by ChatGPT and since I don&#x27;t know the language well it&#x27;s possible they could be improved. I&#x27;d really love feedback if anyone experienced sees an issue with how ChatGPT structured these instructions.

                              <span>Hi, there,
One thing I still yet figure out is how to name my files.
On macOS, it&#x27;s not that a big problem as I have DevonThink 3 Pro, tags and smart folders that help me retrieve files. But whenever I don&#x27;t have access to macOS and look through my long list of files in my external SSD, it was so painful. Currently, I only add a timebase UID to the end of all my files. And my file name is already long and lasting.
Is there any suggestion on how to better name my files, making it friendly to both windows, iOS and macOS?</span>

                              <span>I am working through the red book and trying the examples and exercises in a folder on my computer. I created two files GettingStarted and List, both of which I selected as new Scala classes and then Objects in Intellij.
  
I&#x27;ve noticed that I can only have one main function. I can&#x27;t put a main in both GettingStarted and List. The IDE only recognizes the one in GettingStarted. I&#x27;m thinking this entire folder is considered one project, and you can only have one entrypoint in main. Is this right?
 I put extends App in List, and then I could run and debug things in List. I guess extending the main function from GettingStarted, I can then run the List file on its own.
  
Can someone explain to me how I should be thinking about files interacting with each other? In python I would use a __name__ &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;__main__&quot; to run code in each file. In C, I could write an int main() in each file and run each separately. But it seems in Scala it&#x27;s very specific in terms of how def main() can appear.

                              <span>I know there is Iron and there is Refined, but both of those use some synthetic type under the hood and type conversions. 
 Is there any library that provides ways to simply refine types with simple intersection types? This would mean the code would read naturally and the subtyping/supertyping would work out of the box, eg. Int &amp; Positive &amp; Even would be an Int, a Positive number and an even number &quot;0, 2, 4, 6, etc&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving from Doom to Vanilla Emacs because I wanted a better understanding of emacs from the ground up and I&#x27;m trying to replicate the features I liked most from Doom. I&#x27;m using C-h k and entering key-sequences to figure out the underlying functions and installing packages as needed.
 The one I&#x27;m interested in now is &quot;consult-buffer&quot; which I found useful in that it merged open and recently closed files in order that I had worked with them from session to session.
 There are small things bugging me as I&#x27;m not convinced the &quot;sort&quot; for most recently used files/buffers is reliable with the ideal being that the 2nd last used file shows up in the list first, and the 3rd last used file shows up second.
 Doom has configuration set to modify the consult-buffer there to hide the currently active buffer which is at the top by default when I call consult-buffer. I&#x27;m not finding the consult documentation much help (maybe lacking basic background on some of the concepts to grok it) and I was thinking there would be some of setq that you could use like (setq consult-buffer-ignore-top-items 1). I&#x27;m not sure how to dig into Doom&#x27;s internals to see what it is doing either.

C-h k ( gives that &quot; &#x27;(&#x27; runs the cdlatex-pbb ... insert a pair of parens, brackets or braces&quot;. Same for all the other keys { and [.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to setup sql completion in org-babel-src code block based on this article https://bitspook.in/blog/using-org-mode-as-an-sql-playground/
 But I can&#x27;t make it work.
 Lsp-mode for sql works properly in test.sql file but it doesn&#x27;t work in org-mode. 
 After I ran &#x27;lsp-org&#x27; I got &#x27;progn: Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, nil [2 times]&#x27;. 
 Any idea how to fix it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using password-store package to interact with https://www.passwordstore.org/ which I use for all my passwords and so far everything seems to work correctly, except that, somehow the passwords copied to the clipboard are removed from emacs kill-ring after the timeout but NOT from the system clipboard (e.g. in KDE the password persist and I can see it through KDE&#x27;s clipboard contents).
 When using pass through my terminal everything works as expected and passwords are removed from the system clipboard after the timeout.
 Does anybody knows how to fix this? I want copied passwords to be removed from all clipboards after the given timeout.

Currently, it still shows the items I need at the top, since I use savehist-mode, but the order changes depending on what I select. I&#x27;m using vertico &amp; consult for the selection.
 My current idea is to create a different completing-read command which has the commands I want pinned and I can add &quot;execute-extended-command&quot; as another in there. But a way to pin items would be easier for my use-case.

 Hi; I am using emacs (emacsclient) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with the Gnome desktop (wayland session). I am looking for a way to give emacs a dark title bar to go along with the dark theme, without setting global dark mode (I like some other applications better light), so basically to ask for a dark window decoration on application-basis. Has anyone done this?

 I have found other posts (like this one: https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/doom-emacs-2 or this one https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14129/gtk-enable-set-dark-theme-on-a-per-application-basis) but the solutions here don&#x27;t seem to work for me...

                              <span>Hey all,
 I was hoping to get some advice before I lose a lot of time down this rabbit hole. 
 An important factor in my note taking is accessibility on mobile devices. 
 I&#x27;ve been considering switching my note taking and programming over to Emacs, however those are all markdown.Hence my interest in log seq.Does it work well without mangling your notes like it would for markdown?And how does query suport transfer between the two? As currently obsidian datavieuw queries are a large part of my notetaking flow, and I would like to keep that.
 I&#x27;m aware and in awe of the true power of Emacs, and almost dove into setting up Vim to be the environment I live in, but found Emacs just in time.
