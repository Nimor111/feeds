                              <span>When it comes to choosing http library to serve some endpoints, are there any reason NOT to choose tapir these days? It became a go-to tool for me. Why would I bother with akka-http, zio-http, http4s etc when I can just use tapir? 
 Am I missing something?
 Kudos to Adam Warski and Softwaremill for creating such a great tool!

                              <span>Hi !
 I see that there are still frequent commits to the repo, but no release since May 2023. Releases were quite regular and frequent before that.
 Also, the docs seem inconsistent, switching versions from a page to another.
 I ask because I am considering a little side projet with zio, zio-http, zio-quill,... But I am wondering if the choice will stand the test of time. I am coming from Akka/pekko and I am doing this project also to learn zio and see if it is worth it.
 Thanks in advance ! ;)

                              <span>We are hiring! My team (Plutus Core at IOG) is looking for up to two compiler engineers. Plutus Core is a smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain.
 The main responsibility of the role is to work with a team of experienced engineers and researchers in designing and implementing missing features in Cardano smart contract languages, compilers and runtime systems, and writing documentation for users of the languages.
 We love statically typed functional languages, and we are committed to building a friendly, welcoming, and diverse community of Cardano smart contract developers.

Job posting: https://apply.workable.com/io-global/j/3F1AAE5F43/. Note that the Location section, which currently says &quot;US only&quot;, is inaccurate, and I&#x27;m working to get it updated. We are certainly also hiring from Europe (in fact that would be preferred as most of the current team members reside in Europe, and most of the meetings occur in afternoons of European time), and we also have some flexibility to hire from other parts of the world.
 Codebase: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus. The main components include four languages (Plutus Tx, Plutus IR, Typed Plutus Core, Untyped Plutus Core), compilers from one to the next, the Untyped Plutus Core interpreter, and Agda formalization.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I use orgmode links extensively. In particular, I have hundreds (our thousands) of links to emails (in notmuch). I would very much like to add a tag to any email that is being referenced from org.
 So, what I need to do first is be able to find all matches of a regular expression in all my org files. Non-interactively.
 I have been playing around with xref-matches-in-directory but that would not cover when multiple emails are mentioned in the same line...
 I have been looking and looking but everything I find missed the non-interactive part. 
 So: What is the function to &quot;search for this REGEX in FILES in DIR and return the first capture group&quot;? (the regex has a capture group for the msgid)
 The regex:  (rx-to-string (rx &quot;notmuch:id:&quot; (group (1+ (not &quot;]&quot;)))))

 I have accomplished the first part using the regex match [0-9]\{10\}

                              <span>hi everyone, I am working in IT support, and occur (and even more multi-occur-in-matching-buffer) ist my tool of choice.
 But I would like it to do more (because why not?) I would like to be able to ignore matches, if terms (let&#x27;s name them excludees) are found in the next 5 lines from the search string match or within a number of lines defined by a variable.
 It would allow to save excludees as a list, and ignore certain matches when for instance the &quot;ERROR&quot; relates to a known bug, and we do not want to see it in occur searches any longer.
 Ideally, this could be triggered by a keymap in occur-mode-map, (toggle-ignore-excludees), so that it is up to the user to activate it or not.
 is there already a similar function that does it? How would you proceed to achieve this?
 thanks for your feedback

 I assume this error only happens with emacs native functions, not with the most of the commands coming from other packages.
 How can I fix this? thanks for your help.

 Given that eglot has been part of the core emacs, I believe this is a long lasting wish for a lot of emacsers that has finally been fulfilled. (a stand alone DAP implementation that does not rely on LSP-mode)

 The thing is, after quite a bit of web searching, I only managed to get git, gitman, Python, Common Lisp, and SICP. 
 Is there any repository/FTP/storage that has a treasure trove of info manuals ready to add to Emacs?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Ever since DistroTube finished his Configuring Emacs series a couple of months ago, I moved from using (the somewhat monolithic and impenetrable in my opinion) Doom Emacs every now and then, to seriously using Emacs with his config about a month ago, and I&#x27;ve fallen in love. So much so that I clearly wanted to start using Emacs as my window manager.
 I really like having a statusbar, so since I had been using dwm (also, if you want dwm-like window management, Edwina is the package for you), I figured it was finally time to set Polybar up. I did, but as many people experienced, Polybar had the issue of workspaces being off by one with the standard EMWH module. I looked around, and wasn&#x27;t able to find the solution anywhere else, so I&#x27;ll post my solution.

  and it seems to work well, but whenever i open an individual java file to test it, i get a prompt that this file is not a project file, and gives me options  test.java is not part of any project.
 i &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project root /home/maksatr/Documents/ I &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project by selecting root directory interactively . &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project at current directory /home/maksatr/Documents/ d &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do not ask again for the current project by adding /home/maksatr/Documents/ to lsp-session-folders-blocklist D &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do not ask again for the current project by selecting ignore path interactively n &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do nothing: ask again when opening other files from the current project
 Select action: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; is there a way to set it up so that it works with just a java file as well, instead of working only with large projects? I tried eglot, and it seems to work well as a linter, but for some reason it does not have autocomplete.

                              <span>I have been experimenting with PlantUML in Org Babel recently, and it has greatly enhanced my ability to visualize concepts mentally. During post-meal walks, I often engage in mental planning exercises, such as sketching Gantt charts. However, my deficient drawing abilities consistently impede my progress, particularly when it comes to mentally manipulating lines, arrows, and objects. Since discovering PlantUML, the visualization skills have steadily improved, thanks to its intuitive text-to-graph syntax.
 When reading &quot;Marcovaldo: Or, The Seasons in the City&quot; before bedtime for sleep aid, I spend a significant amount of time immersed in its pleasing pages, sometimes without a clear sense of progress. In such instances, I draw a Gantt chart to gain a visual representation of the slow progr…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m an Emacs newbie (using Doom Emacs with GNU Emacs 29.1). I came from vim, and battling with undo there was crazy enough, but I won using this:
 inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap , ,u inoremap . .u inoremap ( (u inoremap [ [u inoremap &#x3D; &#x3D;u inoremap \&quot; \&quot;u inoremap  u inoremap  u 
 Also, I had autogroup that breaks undo every 4 seconds.
 Basically, this configuration breaks undo on almost every possible type command, every Spacebar, Enter, comma, bracket, moving up, down, everything. This is because I hate when undo deletes the whole screen of text.
 How do I replicate this in Emacs? I read this, but it doesn&#x27;t say what is considered a &quot;recent change&quot;.

 ;; older setting ;; ... (nnimap &quot;gmail&quot; (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;) (nnimap-inbox &quot;INBOX&quot;) (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl)) ;; ... 
 I looked for a solution, or rather asked ChatGPT about the oauth2.el thing. And it suggested the following,
 ;; new settings ;; ... (nnimap &quot;gml&quot; (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;) (nnimap-inbox &quot;INBOX&quot;) (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnimap-authenticator oauth2) (nnimap-oauth2-client-id &quot;client-id&quot;) (nnimap-oauth2-client-secret &quot;client-secret&quot;) (nnimap-oauth2-credentials &quot;~/.emacs.d/.gmail.oauth2-token&quot;)) ;; ... 
 I created a new project in Google Cloud Console, enabled Gmail API and generated client-id and client-secret for the above. But this doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. When I launch Gnus (M-x gnus), it is stuck at &quot;Openning connection to imap.gmail.com via tls...&quot;. Default browser is not launched for the oauth2 workflow.
 I have tested the following code. It launches the default browser and works just fine,
 (require &#x27;oauth2) (defvar my-oauth2-token (oauth2-auth-and-store &quot;https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth&quot; &quot;https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token&quot; &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email&quot; &quot;client-id&quot; &quot;client-secret&quot;)) 
 Has anyone here done this kind of configuration - gnus+gmail+oauth2?

                              <span>For speed, I wish to disable everything that a language server (in this case clangd) provides *except* for code completion. I use eglot. How would I do this?
 PS: No I don&#x27;t want to use lsp-bridge because I want my own custom completion style.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2701/what-zk-software-can-parse-datetime-id-links-between-notes">

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Rene&#x27;s Sublimeless Zettelkasten for a few years, building up a note archive that uses datetime ID links. I think The Archive follows the same convention.
For example, if I create a note called &quot;Test note&quot; now, the text file will have the name 202310191918 Test note.md, and the link inside the software will look like this: [[202310191918]] Test note.
It would be interesting to try an alternative app/software at some point. I&#x27;ve looked around quite a bit, and I&#x27;m surprised about how few there are who supports this link ID syntax. Most software like Obsidian, Roam, and the like, uses the &quot;[[full title inside the brackets]]&quot; style, making them unable to parse my note link syntax. Some allows for choosing slightly different ID types, but usually never this specific one which I thought was one of the simpler ones.
For example, clicking the &quot;test note&quot; link in Obsidian would just result in the software creating a blank note called 202310191918.md. The only software I&#x27;m aware of can parses the datetime link ID type, are these two:
1Writer for iOS mobile phone
The Archive for MacOS
I haven&#x27;t found anything that supports the datetime link ID for neither Android nor Windows. Are any of you aware of any software I&#x27;ve missed that can be used? All platforms are interesting, from iOS/Android to Windows/Linux/Mac. I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s a possibility to edit all of my notes using a Python script or similar to make them compatible, but that would break compatibility with the software I use today. Happy for any tips. Cheers</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;ll be joining a company in 10 days that primarily uses Haskell. I want to be better prepared when I join. 
 What&#x27;s the best way to go about it? I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll do the following in parallel:
 SICP Haskell for Imperative Programmers (YouTube)
 My background: 1.5 YOE Previous experience in Java, Python and Javascript. Haven&#x27;t written pure functional code with any of them.
 Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I just got into Haskell, I&#x27;ve been going through the book &quot;Learn you a Haskell&quot; from the website. right now I am in the Higher Order functions chapter.
 The author talked about implementing a custom map function. I thought to implement it with the little knowledge I had and then compare it with author. I used the list comprehension and the author used the recursion. Same as the standard library 
 map1:me map2:author
 Why is recursion chosen above list comprehension? is it more performant ?

                              <span>Whenever I type a capital M in org, which-key pops up. Emacs thinks I want to type a key chord command. Before I go deleting parts of my config to identify the problem, does anyone know what setting might cause this? I definitely haven’t assigned M to a key chord...
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been using org-mode for a while. I use it mostly for academic-writing, but I plan to explore more possibilities. 
 If I posted this a year ago, probably I would say that I wanted some people&#x27;s settings and just borrowed them. But the more I use org-mode (and Emacs), the more I appreciate the space for personalized settings. So, I decide to start building up my own settings as a rookie.
 Here is my question. I feel that I understand some basics of org-mode, but I am not familiar with &quot;how powerful&quot; it is--with all the great things I can do in org-mode. So, I am looking for a comprehensive introduction or settings of org-mode. It does not have to be for beginners, but I would like to see how a powerful org-mode environment looks like, probably with many useful packages.
 Suggestions? Thank you.

Convenience in Haskell: Ergonomics of Cabal by Vance Palacio
Should we be trying to create some type of wrapper around hpack/cabal that focuses on user experience, avoiding the work of creating a cabal exact-printer, not burdening cabal maintainers with thinking about perfect UX, and leaving cabal alone to be a good packaging tool/power user tool?

                              <span>At Tweag we have been cooking up a JSON Schema to Nickel contract converter, that we’re excited to announce!

Background
Nickel is a configuration language being developed at Tweag. You can get some deep dives into its design from previous blog posts. I’ll summarize it here as JSON, plus functions, plus types and contracts. One of its main use-cases is generating JSON configurations for other programs (Terraform, GitHub actions, etc). Functions allow you to generate large configurations without repeating information; types and contracts help detect problems early when the configuration is malformed and determine where the problem is.
In the JSON world, the role of contracts is served by JSON Schemas, which likewise specify the form that some JSON-encoded data should have. It’s very natural…</span>

                              <span>I use pdf-tools for reading and recently started using bookmark+ and dired+ for navigating. Unfortunately these two great packages seems to conflict. 
 One of the issues I noticed was that the bookmark+ command for bookmarking a pdf location in a pdf-tools buffer didn&#x27;t work; it gave an empty buffer warning. Turns out bookmark+ creator Drew Adams had already suggested a workaround which I discovered here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/72786/bookmark-plus-and-pdf-tools-pdf-view-error
 So that solved or at least patched that issue. But then I noticed that with dired+ installed and any fairly large pdf opened in pdf-tools, emacs will freeze if you attempt to do dired-jump or helm-find-files. Dired-jump without dired+ is not affected by the size of the pdf at all and just opens the underlying directory immediately. But with dired+ anything above about 1mb or so hangs it for quite a while, anything around 10mb or more just freezes it for minutes on end to the point that unless you want to go make yourself lunch and coffee, you will have to force kill emacs to keep working.
 As a noob, non-techie, non-developer, I just wanted to ask, what is the right way of asking about possibly getting this issue fixed, because I love these two packages and would love to have both in working order, but obviously don&#x27;t have the coding know how to do it myself. Of course if anybody knows of a fix that&#x27;s already out there for this issue, I&#x27;d love to know about that as well.

                              <span>I have a bunch of one off functions to do frame/window layout. But an issue I run into is that if I do, say  (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 255 80) (some-other-function-that-looks-at-frame-size-to-split-windows)  Half the time the resize hasn&#x27;t finished by the time the split function runs, and so it splits incorrectly. I&#x27;m assuming the resize happens asynchronously, but I don&#x27;t see a hook or event I can make use of to make sure I&#x27;m splitting after the fact. Is there something I&#x27;m missing? Sleeping doesn&#x27;t seem to fix it because that just delays the resize as well.

 Has someone experienced something similar? Is there a way to improve this?

 I found code here dnd images into auxtex. I am using the excellent Zotra package. I modified the dnd to auctex code to allow drag and drop pdf files into bibtex. My attempt below works. It creates a bibtex &quot;file&quot; field and fills it with the link to the file. However, it would be nice if I could add the following functionality: change the path of the uri to the directory citar-library-paths, change the file-name (excl ext) to the bib-key, move the file to the new path and then sets the file field. This will be useful when one has to manually add files to the bibtex database (in case where the Zotero translation server doesn&#x27;t find the file. Any help or pointers to a package that works similarly would be appreciated.
 (defcustom BIBTex-dnd-protocol-alist &#x27;((&quot;^file:///&quot; . BIBTex-dnd-bibtex-file) (&quot;^file://&quot; . BIBTex-dnd-bibtex-file) (&quot;^file:&quot; .

                              <span>I have recently approached the world of Emacs, which I find great... The problem though is that I feel I&#x27;m wasting too much time trying to have it running in order to do the real work (and I&#x27;ve seen, there are several memes about it), so I was wondering what are the must-have extensions to quickly fire something functional (similar to vscode... Don&#x27;t make me get back to that please) for development.
 By the way, I&#x27;ve seen several configurations scattered around the web, and something tells me that I&#x27;ve ended up in another anarchic realm (which is, something I both hate and love), as if that of distros -being the same except for one thing- wasn&#x27;t enough.
 Of interest are: Python, Go, Bash, Clojure, Elixir, yaml (Docker, Terraform, Ansible), json, csv
 I would also appreciate the general must-have extensions, currently I&#x27;m getting lost navigating Doom Emacs and Melpa packages.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 Anyone aware of any package/code snipped that could replicate the paste behavior of vs code? To elaborate what I mean by that. When I copy image in file manager and paste it in a markdown file in vscode it automatically converts it into relative path from the current file. Alternatively is there a way to auto complete in the &#x60;C-c C-i&#x60; mini buffer?

                              <span>Hey guys, took me a while to figure this out since there isn&#x27;t much information about this anywhere so I figured I&#x27;d leave this here for anyone else having the same issue.
 If you&#x27;re a terminal aficionado and you&#x27;re using Kitty, all you have to do is install kkp.el and enable it in your config and all keybindings will work properly.

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/17af6qf/tried_plantuml_for_drawing_and_it_amazing_on_org/">

                              <span>I am not skilled in drawing, but after trying PlantUML, I found that I can create visual representations directly using code. This has greatly aided my spatial imagination. 
 Take, for example, the usecases diagram:
 @startuml :user: -right-&gt; (Right) :user: -up-&gt; (Up) @enduml 
 https://preview.redd.it/1bx7h7sa7vub1.png?width&#x3D;152&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6271256f6855b88a93a62abf63569f1bc542ded5
 With the use of directional terms like &quot;up&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; you can intuitively draw the diagram as shown. it lowers barrier for non-artists - no drawing ability needed and focuses thought process on structural elements and relationships. 
 When immersed in text, our spatial imagination can often become less active. For example, when trying to imagine the hierarchical structure of an article such as org-mode, our mental representation tends to be more like a bullet structure in an editor, rather than a graphical tree structure. 
 PlantUML addresses the challenge of limited spatial imagination by providing an intuitive text-graph syntax. One notable feature is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) functionality.
 Consider the following example:
 @startwbs !theme mono Emamcs ** Texting Editing ** Note taking ** File Manager ** Literature Programming @endwbs 
 https://preview.redd.it/95b2mg6w9vub1.png?width&#x3D;567&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;2e0f00c54e4d411ec731eba7b23a46a665ed78fc
 The WBS feature in PlantUML facilitates the effortless transformation of a vertical structure into a horizontal representation. This allows me to mentally interpret and visualize the PlantUML code, automatically converting the vertical structure into a spatially-oriented horizontal structure in mind. Consequently, it effectively resolves the issue of my limited visual imagination and improving it continually.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like magit-status to open full frame, ie a single window. When I hit q to exit, I&#x27;d like my previous window configuration to be restored.
 What&#x27;s the best way to do this? Setting the follow var causes it to open full frame, but removes all windows except for one upon exit:
  (setq magit-display-buffer-function #&#x27;magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1) 
 I can get to my previous window layout with winner-undo, but I&#x27;d like q to do the right thing in this case.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hello, I usually run the same command with async-shell-command, however I have to navigate back to the last command history to trigger my last run command, is there any way async-shell-command (and shell-command) can autofill with last run command so that I just hit enter without extra steps? (i am using doom emacs, btw)
 ​
 edit:
 answer to my own question, after a few hours of digging into &#x27;advice&#x27;, turns out it very simple, just 2 lines of code:
 (advice-add #&#x27;read-shell-command :filter-args #&#x27;(lambda(args) (list (car args) (car shell-command-history))))

                              <span>The org agenda can warn you about upcoming deadlines and scheduled items. It would be useful to optionally have warnings about other sorts of events. Birthdays are an obvious case but this should also include non-repeating events (e.g. a friend&#x27;s concert). Has anyone achieved this?
 As suggested here, you can use diary-remind for this. But this is an awkard general solution, as it requires these entries to use a different syntax to normal agenda items. I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone&#x27;s got a more integrated approach by now? I imagine this might use something like -7d in the timestamp, or a WARNING_PERIOD property.

I&#x27;m using doom emacs but can&#x27;t seem to find a built-in keybind and I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution in the docs or from googling. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, redditors. Haskell beginner here. So I tried to solve this problem on codewars. And this was the best I could do
 ​
 module CalculatingWithFunctions (plus, minus, times, dividedBy, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine) where plus, minus, times, dividedBy :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int plus &#x3D; (+) minus &#x3D; (-) times &#x3D; (*) dividedBy &#x3D; div zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine :: (a -&gt; Int) zero _ &#x3D; 0 one _ &#x3D; 1 two _ &#x3D; 2 three _ &#x3D; 3 four _ &#x3D; 4 five _ &#x3D; 5 six _ &#x3D; 6 seven _ &#x3D; 7 eight _ &#x3D; 8 nine _ &#x3D; 9 
 When I try the following unit test:
 (one $ plus $ one) &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (2 :: Int) 
 I get the following error message
 test/CalculatingWithFunctionsSpec.hs:9:19: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘a0 -&gt; Int’ • Probable cause: ‘one’ is applied to too few arguments In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘one’ In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘plus $ one’ In the first argument of ‘shouldBe’, namely ‘(one $ plus $ one)’ | 9 | (one $ plus $ one) &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (2 :: Int) 
 If I understand correctly, &#x60;one&#x60; expects some argument, but obviously nothing is provided. I&#x27;m just lost can&#x27;t figure out what to do next. Please help.

                              <span>Hey everybody!
 So I&#x27;ve been working with PostgreSQL and the JVM for very long now, and I&#x27;ve always been frustrated with the experience. The tedious manual writing, the ease with which you can break things, and the difficulty of testing have all been constant irritations.
 Some months back I started working towards my dream integration layer, with focus on type-safety and developer experience. Powered by cutting-edge code generation.
 I am excited to announce the first version of Typo, and invite you to have a look at what it can do. Through introduction and documentation at https://oyvindberg.github.io/typo/docs/ .
 Github repo with issues for future work here https://github.com/oyvindberg/typo . 
 Curious to hear thoughts on the direction this is headed in :)

                              <span>I have a pattern that I wanted help analyzing. It may be nothing but I wanted to give it more eyes. Applying it to the continuation Monad
 type Cont :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type newtype Cont res a where Cont :: ((a -&gt; res) -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont res a 
 produces an equivalent definition using an existential Functor w. It does so by abstracting a -&gt; .. into a functor application w .., then adding an extra argument of type w a.
 type Cont&#x27; :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type data Cont&#x27; res a where Cont&#x27; :: Functor w &#x3D;&gt; w a -&gt; (w res -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont&#x27; res a 
 Doesn&#x27;t this look weird? Basically translating from Cont ~~&gt; Cont&#x27; we decide what existential functor we want, and we instantiate w ~ (a -&gt;).
  Cont&#x27; @(a -&gt;) :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; ((a -&gt; res) -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont&#x27; res a 
 This turns the first argument w a into into a -&gt; a a…</span>

 data Holder &#x3D; Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length object where object &#x3D; object holder -- Uh Oh 
 Uh oh! We named both the variable and the field accessor function the same thing. We have two options:
  
Rename the variable
  data Holder &#x3D; Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length o where o &#x3D; object holder 
 
Rename the field accessor function
  data Holder &#x3D; Holder {hObject :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length object where object &#x3D; hObject holder 
 
 I know this is depends a lot on preference. Normally, when using other languages, I start functions with uppercase, and variables with lowercase, but I can&#x27;t do this here.
 What do you prefer?

 Scroll to the bottom, and you&#x27;ll see a new Functor-tier (10,000-24,999.99 USD / year) donor.

 Hopefully, if anyone is trying to push Haskell at work, Google&#x27;s presence and support helps.

 It seems as though this has been a thing since at least Sunday.

 Question
 In the context of having bigger hierarchical organizations of your files (around topic, context, purpose, whatever), how do you organize your org files specifically? 
 Background
 What I have now is shown below (edited for privacy and compactness).
 ​
  
I have one Git repository (&quot;academics&quot;) which is organized by projects and employers and topics, with .org files scattered kind of willy-nilly, the same way any other kind of file might be. This organization isn&#x27;t structured around taking advantage of org-mode&#x27;s inter/multi-file features at all.
 Within &quot;academics&quot; I have two directories that are (kind …</span>

                              <span>I am a total orgmode noob, and only use it as an outliner tool to create notes for a second brain system. I don&#x27;t really use it as a task management system that much. 
 I write walls of text so it becomes chaotic to know which is useful. I write useful notes next to useless notes because these notes share the same context. Example:
 * My first day at PizzaLLC
 ** The manager was my high school classmate! (layer 5 - archive/journal)
 ** I would potentially start my own PizzaLLC (layer 1 - idea)
 *** Hiring good employees is essential (layer 2)
 *** Can call my bank for a loan (layer 1 - todo)
 ** Don&#x27;t touch hot oven (layer 0)
 The layers are effectively a way to prioritize more important information. I want to be able to:
  
Only view certain layers at a time and hide the unimportant layers (e.g. hide layer &lt;&#x3D;4). 
 Sort &quot;ideas&quot;, &quot;journal&quot;, &quot;todos&quot; separately. I suppose the best way to do that would be to use tags?

How well EXWM performs nowadays?
 Is it resource heavy compared to other tiling window managers?
 Is it still an issue EXWM not being multi-threaded?
  
My daily tasks involves just opening chrome, telegram and/or slack, watching movies and coding of course. Would it be a good fit for my needs?
 I&#x27;d love to know your thoughts if you use or have some previous experience with EXWM. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hey there,
 Maybe I&#x27;m just missing something obvious, but I&#x27;m a little bit confused as to how eat-eshell-mode works. If I, for example, fire up Eshell with Eat installed:
 emacs-lisp (elpaca-test :interactive t :init (elpaca eat (eat-eshell-mode)) (eshell)) 
 Then I try running e.g. top, I&#x27;d expect top to open in an Eat buffer, but it&#x27;s not doing that for me right now: it just opens in plain ol&#x27; dumpy Term mode.
 What am I missing? Is this not what Eshell integration is supposed to do? How do you use Eshell and Eat together?

When I started writing code in C, after adding the header file, auto completion advised me to add a comment to the code and other strange things. What could this be related to?

                              <span>It might be a bit controversial notion. But when I try to look for extensions say for completion framework there are many available and I used ido and then moved to ivy. I knew helm existed and is much more powerful in terms of feature-set, but never used it. 
 I read that emacs can report on keyboard usage (I think from xahlee&#x27;s posts). Can it be repurposed to monitor which extensions are used often in users setup and they can share that report if they wish to public say via melpa like services. I suppose that melpa downloads can be used as a measure of usage.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m currently experiencing a lot of input lag and slowness when working on javascript projects. May I ask what extra configuration I&#x27;m missing in order to fix this issue? I&#x27;m using doom emacs. My configuration looks as follows:
 (use-package! lsp-mode :hook (rustic-mode . lsp) (json-mode . lsp) (sh-mode . lsp) (typescript-mode . lsp) (javascript-mode . lsp) (js2-mode . lsp) (rjsx-mode . lsp) :commands lsp :config (setq lsp-log-io nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-render-all nil) (setq lsp-inlay-hint-enable nil) (setq lsp-lens-enable nil) (setq lsp-signature-render-documentation nil) (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable nil)) (use-package! lsp-ui :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :config (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq eldoc-documentation-functions nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-diagnostics nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-peek-always-show nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-render-all nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable nil)) 
 As you can see, I have most lsp features disabled to improve performance, but yet I&#x27;m having a bad experience while working on JS files. I&#x27;d kindly appreciate any suggestion.

                              <span>I just read Mickey&#x27;s wonderful article on window management, and has given me the push I need to take control over my emacs windows/frames. I have an idea of what I will configure; maximum of two windows per frame, and if is my portrait frame split horizontally and split vertically for my landscape frame, plus some additional config for Magit. Before I take the plunge, I wanted to quickly reach out to see what other people have done for their configs to get some ideas. Figure might also be good to collect a few different configurations of window configs for people interested.
 Some configs I have found on the way and will update with any suggestions people have:
 *Edit - I will add some more here as I find them/people suggest them
  
Karthink&#x27;s config, good integration with the popper package
 emacs-pure - has some display-buffer-alist settings for magit which are of interest to me, as the built in magit methods for handling new frames isn&#x27;t exactly what I want.
 Sacha&#x27;s config using set-window-configuration and current-window-configuration more than display-buffer-alist. The Ediff settings stick out to me
 burly.el by u/alphapapa - might be an easier way to approach the current-window-configuration/set-window-configuration that Sacha has implemented
 Prot&#x27;s window config - A lot of custom functions to help tailor the window management experience to his liking. 
 eyebrowse - package to make Emacs be like i3. Example config from Karl Voit and the use of eyebrowse-restore to help make the configurations stick around.

 Any recommendations, please feel free to share them.

 The fact that the read function yields symbols instead of strings from user-input was a delightful revelation. This discovery convinces me that the fundamental nature of symbols in elisp when compared to strings.

                              <span>I just tried out eglot today, and I must say that I am very very impressed. However, like all software, the julia language server has a few quirks that need to be worked around. Long story short, I have two folders (not nested or anything):
  
folder1 - A git repository of a large julia project that I cloned. Starting eglot here only works partially. Anything imported from other packages is a missing reference.
 
folder2 - A folder I created with various scripts that I wrote for the project in folder1. It contains a Project.toml detailing the necessary julia environment for those scripts to work. Starting eglot here works flawlessly. Both functions defined in folder1 as well as the other packages folder1 relies upon are referenced correctly.
 
 Is there a way for me to start eglot in folder2 but have it work as if I have started it in folder1? 
 I believe one potential solution might be to tell Project.el that the git repository in folder1 belongs to the project in folder2, but I couldn&#x27;t find a command for doing so.
 Alternatively, can I tell eglot in folder1 to connect to the language server that was started by eglot in folder2?
 edit: Hope the question makes sense, and apologies if not everything is phrased in the correct language. I&#x27;m pretty new to both eglot and project.el. Many thanks in advance for any help or hints!

                              <span>Hey everybody, first time poster here.
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a while now, but just recently starting toying with configs, experiencing new packages, learning some elisp so I can customize my emacs experience and overall making it my own.
 A while back I noticed I needed some sort of dark mode functionality to change the theme to a darker one when there is less sunlight. After searching for some packages, I found none that really suited me.
 So I decided to write my own: https://github.com/pedroangelo/theme-rotation.el
 Check it out and tell me what you guys think. I&#x27;ve also included a sort of related work section in the README that discusses similar packages, and why I didn&#x27;t found them to my taste. 
 PS: I wrote this package for my personal use. But if more people find it useful, I&#x27;d be quite satisfied with myself.
 Also, do you think I should work towards getting it published in MELPA? I don&#x27;t mind the work if it something that potentially many people might enjoy using.

                              <span>While a for-loop is a straightforward construct in other programming languages, the loop macro, despite its power, can present challenges due to its intricacy. I find myself frustrated by its complexity.
 However, its conceptual abstractions are intriguing. Take, for example, the following code snippet:
 (loop for i below 10 sum i) 
 The utilization of the term &quot;below&quot; in this context is particularly striking. Contrastingly, in languages like JavaScript, I typically read &quot;i &lt; 10&quot; as &quot;i less than 10,&quot; pronouncing the two words &quot;less than&quot; in order to read the &quot;&lt;&quot; symbol.
 The act of reading &quot;&lt;&quot; as &quot;less than&quot; momentarily interrupts my cognitive flow between the two words. The loop macro condenses it as a single word, &quot;below,&quot; allowing me to pronounce &quot;i &lt; 10&quot; more succinctly and smoothly, without interruption. Another viable alternative could be &quot;under.&quot;
 Moreover, the expression &#x60;1 &lt; i &lt; 10&#x60; can be read as &quot;from 1 to 10.&quot;
 (loop for i from 1 to 10 sum i) 
 It enhance code readability mentally and streamline cognitive processing.

                              <span>Hi, Im not sure if this is the right platform to ask on. Long story short, Im stuck at this GIS job, massive computing experience under my belt, but close to 20% experience in GIS. Im playing around with SmallWorld locally and on a cloned repo. But they also have a Development environment on a remote server. Everyone here says theres no way to use your own Emacs version (28) on this one, except Emacs 23. Do you have any comment on this? Talk to me like Im a child. Im not sure if its an SSH setup. A senior told me it isnt (in a very thick accent). He might be bullshitting. (They use a VPN and sometthing called &quot;f5 networks endpoint inspector&quot;)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to make my Emacs configuration more reproducible, in part by creating variables with paths to packages, directories which depend on what machine I&#x27;m on:
 (if my/laptop-p (progn ... (defvar my/mu4e-dir &quot;/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e&quot; &quot;Location of local &#x60;mu4e&#x27; files installed by system package manager&quot;) ... )) 
  
 Here, my/laptop-p tests if (equal (system-name) &quot;my-thinkpad&quot;).
 This system works well, so that for the relevant example of mu4e (which is apparently quite tricky to set up in straight.el ) I can use:
 (use-package mu4e :straight (:local-repo my/mu4e-dir :type built-in) ... ) 
  
 The package loads and the configuration works fine.
 But doing straight-freeze-versions gives:
 straight--dir: Wrong type argument: stringp, my/mu4e-dir 
 This can be fixed by replacing my/mu4e-dir with the string &quot;/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to avoid this if I can.
   Is there a way I can keep using my defined variable my/mu4e-dir instead of the full path name?

                              <span>Once I saw nil or &#x27;nil from some (setq ..), it usually worried me.
 The barely nil appears to be a variable name no more than &#x60;foo bar zoo&#x60; and there shoud be a value it points to.The quoted &#x27;nil seems to be a data or a value in data mode and there might exist a name it is given.it looks no difference with symbols as &#x27;nilll &#x27;nilllllll or &#x27;nillllllllll as data.
 Every time see them, I find myself hesitating, uncertain and disturbing.
 This picture tells they are identical and comfort me to get an insight that lisp is much more pragmatic in evovling by patching up.
 As a result, I stop worring its theoretical consistency and confidently proceed with using &#x60;nil&#x60;.
 4 disguises of nil
 The wizard book SICP states it as:
  
Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort. Instead, it evolved informally in an experimental manner in response to users&#x27; needs and to pragmatic implementation considerations.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a pretty solid workflow now based loosely on GTD with TODO tasks in categories, projects and NEXT tasks, weekly and monthly reviews etc.. I have a good org-super-agenda config that I&#x27;ve been using happily for months.
 The issue I have is that out of the myriad of tasks I have available to work on at any one point, I am not good at just picking one and getting on with it. Almost like flicking through Netflix and never actually deciding what to watch.
 Might be more of a behavioral problem, but I wondered if anyone has a function or utility for picking a task at random from a given org buffer and highlighting it in a new buffer, or similar. Idea being this would force selection from a set of tasks you know you could progress.
 Or has anyone got good suggestions on how to tackle picking a next task on which to spend time? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily bad task definition, and it&#x27;s also not that they should be someday/maybe tasks to which I&#x27;m not firmly committed.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I believe this is a bug, but I want to make sure I&#x27;m not missing something obvious. 
 I know I can kill entire trees by folding them and then calling org-kill-line with point at the beginning of the line where the heading is. I do this all the time (though I have set org-ctrl-k-protect-subtrees to t to avoid accidents). 
 However, if visual-line-mode is on and the heading text continues to a second visual line, this stops working as expected. 
 Take for example the following two trees: 
 * Heading This is some text * This is a heading on the longer side for an example This is some text 
 Now, using emacs -Q, evaluate the following code (I set the frame size as narrow as I did so that the second heading only wraps around to a second visual line): 
 (org-mode) (visual-line-mode) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 30 50) (org-overview) 
 With point on the first heading, call kill-line. The entire subtree will be killed. 
 With point on the second heading, now, call kill-line. Only the first visual line occupied by that heading will be killed. 
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>I want to define the config for all the programs I use in emacs org-mode. One thing I need to be able to do, is to change the colorscheme of my system. I define a set of variables, that then get updated in the config of various different programs.
 For example, I have this code block:
 #+begin_src css :tangle ~/test.css .test_class { background: $color } #+end_src 
 I would like to be able to define the color variable, be it in the org-document, or somewhere else, and then when org babel tangles it, the resulting file should have the variable changed.
 So, if color&#x3D;&quot;#ffffff, then test.css should look like:
 .test_class { background: #ffffff } 
 Since I need to do this for many different programs, it needs to be language agnostic. Org babel simply needs to treat the code block as a piece of text, and replace the variables.
 What is the easiest way to achieve this?

                              <span>I have an issue where I cannot authenticate with Haskell, but it works fine from Mongo express or Mongo Compass.
 I have the following docker setup:
 version: &#x27;3&#x27; services: mongo: image: mongo environment: - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE&#x3D;badminton ports: - &quot;27017:27017&quot; mongo-express: image: mongo-express environment: - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER&#x3D;mongo - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT&#x3D;27017 - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ENABLE_ADMIN&#x3D;true - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_DATABASE&#x3D;admin - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD} depends_on: - mongo ports: - &quot;8888:8081&quot; ENV: MONGO_ROOT_USER&#x3D;devroot MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD&#x3D;devroot MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN&#x3D;dev MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD&#x3D;dev 
 And then this simple example:
 import Database.MongoDB mongo :: IO () mongo &#x3D; do pipe  show closed is_auth  show is_auth dbs &lt;- access pipe master &quot;badminton&quot; allDatabases print dbs close pipe 
 Which prints:
 &quot;Closed? False&quot; &quot;AUTH: False&quot; ingest-exe.EXE: expected (&quot;databases&quot; :: [[Field]]) in [ ok: 0.0, errmsg: &quot;Command find requires authentication&quot;, code: 13, codeName: &quot;Unauthorized&quot;] CallStack (from HasCallStack): error, called at .\Data\Bson.hs:113:10 in bson-0.4.0.1-5H36pPFgi2uLQl05dXyxb6:Data.Bson 
 I am sorry to just throw this code dump, but I have no idea what I am missing. I have tried &quot;
 setLocaleEncoding utf and ascii&quot;.
 EDIT:
 I just tried with version 3.6 of mongodb, and then it works. So it seems the library is not up to date with latest version of mongodb.

 If anyone is interested in the operating system, here is a paper.
 http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rsc/Resources/context-OS.pdf
 This is the piece of code
 open :: Tree -&gt; CC r (Z r) open tree &#x3D; promptP (\p -&gt; let visit n &#x3D; shiftP p (return . Yet n) in liftM Done (traverse visit tree)) 
 traverse is a procedure, and Tree and Z is a data type, see
 data Tree &#x3D; Leaf Int | Node Tree Tree data Z r &#x3D; Done Tree | Yet Int (Maybe Int -&gt; CC r (Z r))

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am pretty familiar with OOP &amp; imperative languages in general, and so my thought process is perhaps completely wrong, in the context of Haskell, when it comes to solving this :
 How would you go about managing an interface-implementation type of pattern?
 Let me give you a concrete example to illustrate : I have written two Window management abstractions for my application using GLFW &amp; SDL2, which are just defined as &#x27;Window&#x27;
 data Engine &#x3D; Engine { window :: Window } 
 Both of my implementations have the same function signatures and so for the moment I can decide which variant to use in my &#x27;Engine&#x27; / program by which module I end up importing ; obviously given they share the same function names, I can only import &amp; use one at a time.
 What I would like to do is be able to choose at runtime/dynamically or at least through a parameter.
 Now with my meager experience with Haskell &amp; functional programming in general, I can see two ways to achieve this :
  
Using typeclasses, i.e. have a class Window, which defines my &#x27;interface&#x27; 
 Then declare an instance for both my GLFW &amp; SDL2 version
 
 Or an abstract data-type which uses record-syntax to list the functions of that interface. 
 Then create a new value our of this datatype &amp; pipe the respective function implementations.
 
  
I realise the above probably makes more sense in an OOP kind of way, so I would be interested to know how this sort of pattern would typically be achieved the Haskell way?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating a parser framework and am testing it on JSON. Currently, I have json &#x3D; object  array  string  number  bool  null which is fine if there is no parse error, but when there is one I only get the null error message which is not helpful. I need something like failIrecoverable for times when an opening array bracket has already been parsed so the next alternative is not run and the proper error is returned. Is there a transformer like this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to announce an even newer release of stan, a static analysis tool for Haskell. This release extends last week&#x27;s release by adding support for 9.6, extending the supported range to 8.8-9.6.
 About stan
 Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions on how to do so. Read more about stan in its README.
 Installation
 I recommend obtaining stan from Hackage by following the installation instructions in the README.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stan-0.1.0.0
 Help wanted
 stan lacks active maintainers and is currently in essential maintainance only mode. I am helping out to make sure stan can continue to build with newer GHCs. I would welcome assistance, particularly on the following issues:
  
Supporting GHC 9.8
 Prospective support for GHC 9.10
 Fixing caching on Github Actions
  
If you would like to contribute to Stan please create an issue on the Github repository.
  
[1] Some point releases are excluded because the GHC API doesn&#x27;t seem to provide enough type information, notably the later releases in the 9.2 series.

 I am currently learning functional programming and I am unsure how to implement this while following the paradigm. The problem I am facing is that I want to implement a function that stores an arbitrary large string (e.g. a sentence) by appending it to the data structure such that the system is building a text. The only operations that will be used is append and clear the data structure. 
 I have thought about implementing a rope data structure but I am afraid that it is overkill for this purpose. What do you think?

                              <span>One of useful properties of IO monad is that it is lazy: functions return not a result but wrapper that can be evaluated later and, more importantly, altered in builder style:
 doSomething().handle { case e: Exception &#x3D;&gt; &quot;oops&quot;}.timeout(10.seconds) 
 What&#x27;s interesting this behavior can be reimplemented on contextual functions, without syntactic and runtime overhead
 // contextual functions without context are not supported // so we have to add something here trait CanLazy // looks like eager evaluation but in fact it is not, like by-name parameter def doSomething(): CanLazy ?&#x3D;&gt; String &#x3D; throw Exception(&quot;my error&quot;) extension[A](v: CanLazy ?&#x3D;&gt; A) // classical error handling for IO monad but without IO monad def handle(f: Throwable &#x3D;&gt; A)(using CanLazy): A &#x3D; try v catch case e &#x3D;&gt; f(e) given CanLazy &#x3D; new CanLazy {} // handle will correctly wrap doSomething() invocation // prints &quot;my error&quot; to the console println(doSomething().handle(_.getMessage)) 
 In addition:
  
handle will not compile on &quot;totally eager&quot; functions like println()
 handle will work on context functions of several arguments.
 def foo: (CanLazy, Context, CanThrow[MyError]) ?&#x3D;&gt; Result. Doesn&#x27;t it look familiar?
  
As for overhead:
  
CanLazy parameter can be eliminated by erased definition (experimental)
 inlining handle together with erased reduces overhead to single val proxy &#x3D; () -&gt; doSomething()
 I believe compiler could be fixed to reduce overhead to zero
  
I find this fascinating and is wondering whether can new programming style emerge from this? To combine power of lazy evaluation and simplicity of eager functions.

 I&#x27;m back to Emacs after trying NeoVim for awhile and trying to make my config as minimal as possible. projectile-project-root is (I think) the only thing I&#x27;m missing from that package to get my old workflow back.

Denote is a wonderful package that I use to organize my notes, and having the possibility to have a code block with links to specific notes works well with my workflow (having rx conditions is great in Denote 2.0!). However, things would be perfect if there would be a way to have all the content of those links files (sans the front matter) in an org-mode buffer (or an org file). Can this be done? It&#x27;s Emacs, so I&#x27;m sure it can, but what would be the most elegant approach to this?

                              <span>Hello to all,
 I recently stumbled upon the setopt function introduced in emacs 29.
  
defmacro setopt (&amp;rest pairs)
 Set VARIABLE/VALUE pairs, and return the final VALUE. This is like &#x27;setq&#x27;, but is meant for user options instead of plain variables. This means that &#x27;setopt&#x27; will execute any &#x27;custom-set&#x27; form associated with VARIABLE.
  
So basically it looks like a customize-set-variable but shorter. Indeed, both are defined almost next to each other, with most of the interesting bits duplicated.
 After reading its source code, I have the impression that its only major difference with customize-set-variable (besides the fact that customize-set-variable is also a user command) is related to user theme.
 I am not sure about the impact of using one over the user, do you guys have an opinion about this ? Cheers

                              <span>Ok, I&#x27;m quite new to Emacs and have a hard time fighting the learning curve. I&#x27;m using Spacemacs now because documentation is good, although stability is abysmal. But I kind of managed to configure it to an extent.
 Here&#x27;s a problem. I need a tool that does basically this: I type a search phrase (name) and it shows every entry in an org file that contains this name, and if there&#x27;s no entry with this name (i.e. heading with this name), automatically creates it.
 So it&#x27;s basically deft, but deft works on multiple files which I find extremely inconvenient. I read the docs, but found no way to configure it to work on a single file.
 I believe it is possible to do with a simple org-capture using a custom function that checks if there is a heading in an org file and creates it if there is not. But elisp is high above my knowledge level right now and I don&#x27;t want to invent the bicycle given how simple my problem is.
 I am extremely overwhelmed with options, but I think there must be some simple way to do this that does not require writing some custom code and (preferably) installing more plugins than I already have.

                              <span>I recently update my whole Emacs installation on my Artix Linux box.
 The operation, apparently, went wrong because centaur tabs aren’t working, leaving a message
 Symbol function definition is void: left
 Running with —debug-init reveals the culprit is effectively in centaur tabs.
 Never saw this error before. Any hint?

                              <span>I want to embed my tex source and my org mode file inside a pdf. I use org 9.7 which allows for the building of a conditional preamble. It seems that when I compile an org mode with emacs, the jobname is not the file name., so nothing gets embedded. If I include...
 \begingroup\escapechar&#x3D;-1 \xdef\jobname{\expandafter\string\csname main\endcsname} \endgroup \usepackage[main,include]{embedall} 
 then if the org file my tex file compiles to is named &quot;main,&quot; then the file embeds successfully. I&#x27;d like to make it so that &quot;main&quot; is the name of whatever file I am working on at the moment.
 In my org configuration file, I currently have...

                              <span>Hello,
 This may be a silly question but I cannot figure it out, I&#x27;m using company-mode to autocomplete my C code, so for example I get this completion:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/cb45kdq9i9ub1.jpg?width&#x3D;1111&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;d2bc3dd5b90fe0fccdb927603b0fe66178df92c4
 The first field is highlighted and when I start typing I replace the content of the placeholder with my code, but how can I move to the next one? or what&#x27;s the best way to deal with this situation if this is not possible? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>With the kitty terminal, I could control exactly how the font is rendered by using text_composition_strategy: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#opt-kitty.text_composition_strategy
 I usually use it to make the fonts slightly thicker and easier to read. Is there anything similar in Emacs? For reference this is how my fonts looks in the terminal vs. Emacs:

 Emacs just looks so damn thin for my poor eyes. I can probably just increase the weight, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a better approach.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using vertico+consult+orderless.
 I&#x27;m not happy with the default completion behavior in find-file, which selects the first candidate instead of just completing what is common to all candidates like the default emacs behavior.
 
 Lets suppose I have a directory with the following files inside: myfile1 myfile2 and myotherfile.
 With vertico, when I use find-fille in this directory, if I press my then TAB then myfile1 will be added to the minibuffer prompt.
 What I want is the default behavior of emacs (emacs -q):
  
if I press my then TAB, nothing should happen, then I add f and the completion should be myfile.
 if I press myo then TAB, myotherfile should be added to the minibuffer.
  
 
Do someone know how I can achieve this ?

                              <span>Just trying out c++-ts-mode with Emacs 29.1 (now that I have finally updated), but one thing I can&#x27;t get to work is configuring directory-specific indentation rules.
 Previously I set c-file-style in dir-locals-set-class-variables depending on the directory and it all worked fine. With c++-ts-mode I have changed that to set c-ts-mode-indent-style instead, but it doesn&#x27;t seem the take effect (well, the variable gets set correctly for the buffer, but the indentation style isn&#x27;t applied). Only after using c-ts-mode-set-style in that buffer to set the style, indentation is set up correctly.
 Any idea how I can get this working?

 it looks like the internet doesn&#x27;t work, but I asked people in different countries to try, and get the same result. 
 after I added the &#x27;Port 993&#x27;, I get error

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m having some difficulty trying to create a helper function for a keyboard shortcut. The error claims that [init-ocaml-project] is void, so I assume I am mis-constructing it in some way? Thanks!

 I tried to get this into Melpa, but was rejected because it&#x27;s a smart-compile fork. I have extended its functionality so much it may as well its own project.
 I&#x27;ve been using this for many years, with enhancements along the way, like it,for example, being able to find the root of your github project to run compiles from there.
 You will need to manually install this, but that should be no effort for most Emacs users.

                              <span>Is it possible to modify Orgzly with Lisp? I want to add more functionality to Orgzly.
 Eg:
 (I) Repeat a task on every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday without having to add repeaters and then mark as complete every time I want the task to move forward (similar to how Google calendar or tasks.org can do it)
 (II) Configure in such a way that anything marked with specific tags (or a cluster of tags) should appear on a specific day/s of the week, such as all the tasks tagged with &#x27;backup&#x27;, &#x27;upkeep&#x27;, &#x27;repairs&#x27; and &#x27;meta&#x27;, appearing on Sunday
 (III) Add dates that denote &#x27;from&#x27; and &#x27;to&#x27; dates, and configure so that they appear that way on the agenda/schedule
 etc.
 If Orgzly does not support that, is there any other way I can do it? Another app maybe?
 Also, I am not super tech-savvy. I can read a documentation and understand stuff. I have done basic programming, but nothing with near-low-level type languages. As of right now, I know nothing about Lisp. So Orgmode enthusiasts, would you say that this is feasible.

                              <span>Hi !
 I made Horn, an org parsen written in typescript.
 I needed a js org parser for one of my PWA related project and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the ones I found (couldn&#x27;t parse large files, failed to understand /bold italic/, written in an alien-to-my-eyes js...). 
 I decided to build it myself; it is right now available on npm and github. It can parse 10mB files within 1-2 seconds, and it has a good support of org features.
 You can reach me here if you have some suggestion. I hope it may be useful to the community !

                              <span>Most of Will&#x27;s ZK focuses on self-improvement ideas. Is self-improvement a bad thing?  I don&#x27;t think so. He needs a lot of improvement. They are reminders. Once he hears or reads an idea, it seems so naturally intuitive. He thinks, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard that before.&quot; He&#x27;s unsure if capturing the idea in a note or writing it into the world makes a difference.
As soon as Will makes such a declaration, Will finds a truckload of notes that don&#x27;t exactly fit the self-improvement line of ideas. Notes on ideas from Python, materials engineering, atmospheric science, architecture, self-driving cars, dog training, uji, vision, and many others. These others only make up a fraction of Will&#x27;s ZK.
Will is hunting for interesting things to take notes on that are not philosophically based on self-improvement.
This evolving process is happening from the bottom up. He is finding it to be quite enjoyable and is training his mind, enjoying the journey rather than just the end result.
Is Will off base? Is this a thing? How do you view the mix of the content of your zettels?
He presently processed a self-help article 1 that pointed out three &quot;hobbies worth pursuing.&quot;

                              <span>So I use doom emacs and I&#x27;ve just installed the evil tutor on packages.el to cure my stupidity, problem is, the tutor doesn&#x27;t want to start. When I run &#x60;evil-tutor-start&#x60; using M - x, it says &#x60;Cannot open load file: no such file or directory, evil-tutor&#x60;.
 I did everything I was supposed to, I ran doom sync and restarted emacs. I don&#x27;t get why it hates me.

                              <span>Hello friends,
 I recently tried installing kde-plasma-desktop with sddm on an Ubuntu 22.04 installation with GNOME. I didn&#x27;t try it in a vm first and thought I could just get away with having both on my machine with no problems. Stupid, I know. I ended up removing KDE and reinstalling gdm, but now I&#x27;m missing all of my GTK icons when I start up Emacs.
 https://i.imgur.com/fRdlr8o.png
 The strange part is, that only sometimes the usual GTK icons will show up, and it&#x27;s always when I least expect it. I suspect that some of the config changes that happened when I installed KDE conflicted with my GTK and my QT themes.
 I&#x27;ve tried removing gtk3.0 and gtk4.0 folders from my ~/.config directory, removing ~/.local/share/icons, and inspecting ~/.themes, but I see nothing related to icons there. I&#x27;m just wondering what could be causing this behavior, and if it&#x27;s conflicting with other applications on my system I haven&#x27;t discovered yet. GNOME tweaks says I&#x27;m using Yaru-magenta-dark, which appears to be working everywhere except for Emacs.
 Interested what people&#x27;s thoughts are on this. I don&#x27;t care much for the icons in the first place, but I thought this behavior was strange. Thank you

                              <span>Hi. I have an issue with project.el (and projectile for that matter). They both seem to think they know better than me. They both try to auto-detect the root folder for a project, depending on if there&#x27;s some specific files present, or if the folder contains a git repository.
 I don&#x27;t like this. Why does it work like that? What I want about these packages is to let me define what folder is a project, explicitely. I want to tell them, &quot;hey, this folder is a project&quot;, even if its empty, and I never want them to automatically add any project.
 Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi, im new to the emacs space and am looking to dig deeper into modding emacs.
 I&#x27;m a web developer working a lot with typescript in the frontend and backend.
 I started off with some basic packages like projectile, LSP, magit and evil. However I&#x27;m getting kind of annoyed using evil mode, because i have to consider stuff like deactivating certain keys wenn i&#x27;m in another buffer (e.g xref buffer) or undos that dont work out of the box properly.
 Furthermore I would also like start learning more elisp, for which reason I&#x27;m doubting if i should even use vim bindings, because paredit seems to be a thing that i cant get working with vim bindings.
 However I also dont want to leave my vim skills behind and would rather prefer a professional emacs config that is tailored around evil, if thats possible.
 Can someone recommend a lightweight emacs config repository for ergonomic evil usage? Something thats really small and easy to understand and extend (So no spacemacs or doom).
 ​
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Seeing this post explain how to install and use Emacs on Android (native build), I wanted to share a tip on how to have a unified init.el file which can be synced across both Android and Linux so you don&#x27;t have to change anything manually.
 Here is an example for my org notes:
 ;; Setting the base directory for org files (setq org-directory (cond ((eq system-type &#x27;gnu/linux) &quot;~/Notes&quot;) ((eq system-type &#x27;android) &quot;/storage/emulated/0/Notes&quot;) (t &quot;~/Notes&quot;))) 
 Essentially, for each part of the init.el file which is different based on the system it runs on, you can detect the appropriate system and do a different configuration.
 This will resolve any of your Android specific changes you need to implement, like I have with my org notes location in the presented example.
 With this, you can have the same init.el file and simply sync it across your systems.

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m a long time Spacemacs user who is just now transferring to a roll my own config. I&#x27;ve been using and loving Magit for years, and I&#x27;ve just discovered Forge while browsing packages to add to my config.
 My question is, can you use this for code review? I&#x27;d like to be able to view all of the code changes that a Pull Request (my team uses Github) contains and I&#x27;d like to be able be able to add comments to changed lines in the PR. I can&#x27;t figure out how to do that with Magit and Forge. Is this a workflow that&#x27;s possible and do you have any pointers on how I can achieve this?

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve used both project.el and Projectile I want to know what are the differences between the two.
 I learnt on IRC that Projectile is much older than project.el so there are more plugins for it. But I want to know some specific examples of things that Projectile can do but project.el can&#x27;t. And specific examples of things that project.el can do but Projectile can&#x27;t.
 Anyone has good experience with both to share this stuff?

                              <span>I&#x27;m exporting an org file with images to html, and using the #+ATTR_HTML attribute to resize the image. That&#x27;s having no effect, because the Emacs I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t have ImageMagick enabled.
 Yes, I can rebuild from source and enable it, but presumably the emacs devs disabled it by default for a reason. Furthermore, I&#x27;m finding that multiple sources that I might get a prepackaged Emacs from have this feature disabled. Rebuilding from source feels like I&#x27;m punching open a hole someone intentionally closed.
 Is there a workaround for what I&#x27;m trying to do? The best I can come with (other than rebuilding Emacs from source) is to use an external program to resize my image to the size I want it to be. That&#x27;s fairly cumbersome, and it will clutter my directory with various image sizes as I experiment and figure out what i want. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to announce a new release of stan, a static analysis tool for Haskell. stan now supports GHCs in the range 8.8-9.4[1].
 About stan
 Stan is a command-line tool for analysing Haskell projects. It discovers which parts of the code can potentially be improved, and offers suggestions on how to do so. Read more about stan in its README.
 Installation
 I recommend obtaining stan from Hackage by following the installation instructions in the README.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stan-0.1.0.0
 Help wanted
 stan lacks active maintainers and is currently in essential maintainance only mode. I am helping out to make sure stan can continue to build with newer GHCs. I would welcome assistance, particularly on the following issues:
  
Supporting GHC 9.6
 Supporting GHC 9.8
 Prospective support for GHC 9.10
 Fixing caching on Github Actions
  
If you would like to contribute to Stan please create an issue on the Github repository.
 Credits
 Thanks to the Kowainik team for creating stan in the first place. Thanks to Veronika Romashkina for accepting me as a new maintainer for the project.
  
[1] Some point releases are excluded because the GHC API doesn&#x27;t seem to provide enough type information, notably the later releases in the 9.2 series.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a very strange bug when using emacs remotely. Currently my .emacs file is commented out except the lines defining the theme:
 When i start editing a file, i experience a severe display bug that prevents me from reading an edited line until i quit and reload the file, It is difficult to explain, but i&#x27;ve attached a screenshot of a line of text before and after typing the string &quot;bannana bannana bannana bannana&quot; at the start of the line (and pressing no other keys). I can start emacs with the -q flag to avoid this error, but I would prefer not to as I very much like having the theme set. I&#x27;ve also tried enabling a theme after starting with -q (in case there is a typo in my emacs file), and I get the same errant behavior.
 Has anyone here encountered a bug like this before?

                              <span>Seems as if one wants to learn lisp, one has to learn emacs first. That said, I am looking for resources for the absolute beginner to learn emacs, looking for something along the lines of Common lisp A gentle introduction to symbolic computation., but for emacs. Something that assumes you know nothing, starts at the absolute beginningwith lots of exercise and answer to those exercise. Any help will be appreciated. 
 Thanks
 For the record I have been through search, but the signal to noise ratio is pretty high.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested to know what the future of remove development with emacs might look like. I&#x27;m a long time emacs user, and use rust, lsp-mode, magit and projectile heavily. The remote experience with tramp just isn&#x27;t very good. I&#x27;ve had to work around several bugs that lead to hangs, and even though I&#x27;m only ~20millis away from my remote machine performance is pretty bad. I believe I&#x27;ve already done everything I can to make it fast (ssh control master, etc.), and I&#x27;m still not happy. On the other hand, VSCode (which I&#x27;m not familiar with) or IntelliJ make remote development a breeze. I really like how they hide latency, and handle reconnects well. I&#x27;ve also tried terminal emacs on the remote machine, but I just can&#x27;t deal with the input lag.
 It&#x27;s remarkable how emacs has been able to adapt over the years, and so I&#x27;m interested to hear about some ideas to keep emacs relevant for this usecase.

                              <span>I&#x27;m seriously considering buying an M2 MacBook, after over 20 years on Linux. My main concern is whether it will be difficult to set up Emacs after such a long-term investment in my init files. I would love to hear from others who have made the same transition -- was it hard? Do you have tips to make it easier? 
 Thanks in advance!

 My story:
 Evil: I came to Emacs after a long time of using Vim. Everyone told me to just use Evil and be done with it. I tried Devil but I dont know what it is about it that it left me dissatisfied. There was this feeling that I need to learn Emacs way of doing things. Because all documentation or tutorials I get have Emacs keys. Virtually none of them tell how to do same things in Evil. Always felt like an outsider. Jokes like C-x M-c M-butterfly made me feel like I am not in on the joke because I use Evil. I wanted to learn the Emacs way.
 Pure Emacs: So I uninstalled Evil and went all in to pure Emacs keys. I learnt them quickly but key chords always felt difficult on my fingers. Then I found God mode and Devil…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I recently did &quot;something&quot; in an emacs buffer and lost a bunch of text in different places, and I was unable to undo the deletions. I tried to use ediff (I guess I should have used ediff-backup?) to recover the lost text but not being competent I mixed up buffers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and ended up copying the deletions to the backup file and couldn&#x27;t recover from there .... :-).
 Now I am curious if there are recent &#x27;best practices&#x27; to 
  
Avoid doing &#x27;something&#x27; that causes text to disappear
 Have a more robust, for a beginner like me, set of autosave and associated settings.

                              <span>Hi! Seaman Emacs is my attempt at a literate, modular (module-layer), extensible Emacs configuration.
 Seaman makes it easy to add new packages or combinations of packages to your config and safely test them out, as well as phasing out unused packages and remove bloat from your config. Lastly, all source code is easily navigable and documented, with a single .org file in charge of running the show.
 If you use Emacs 29 it&#x27;s super easy to try it out with --init-directory !
 I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback/suggestions/contributions a lot :)
 https://github.com/alopezrivera/Seaman-Emacs/
 Design choices:
  
Source: seaman.org contains is the source of all modules and layers. All source files are asynchronously tangled when saving. config.org contains the source code of your (in this case my) config. All blocks inside are asynchronously tangled to init.el when saving
 Package manager: straight.el
 Key bindings: Emacs + custom
  
Out of the box:
  
Clean UI
 Homescreen
 Easy theme switching (light/dark)
 &quot;Full pack&quot; Org Mode with org-agenda, org-calendar, org-roam etc.
 &quot;Full pack&quot; PDF support with pdf-tools (highlighting, etc.)
 Magit for VC
  
Example config:
 My personal config built with Seaman is here:

 ​
 WOndering if anyone has a workflow that gets you from org-mode text to Google Slides quickly and painlessly? I am not talking about anything fancy, and I&#x27;m also not talking about org-reveal or org-re-reveal -- just somehow getting to the point of having one slide per headline, with text. And I can apply templates and formats &amp; add pictures after I have a draft up. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting interested in learning Haskell, and I&#x27;m trying to find a good first project to really sink my teeth into. Like the title says, I&#x27;m mainly targeting scientific applications -- nothing fancy right now, mostly just diagonalizing some matrices and numerical integration -- and I&#x27;m looking for some good libraries to use.
 I&#x27;ve already done a bit of searching on Hackage, but I&#x27;m mainly interested here in what people would recommend for N-dimensional arrays and matrix diagonalization. What&#x27;s the general feeling on HMatrix?
 I guess I should also mention that I&#x27;m coming from a Python+Rust background, where my workflow was to do all the heavy lifting in Rust, serialize the data to a npy/npz file, and then do all the plotting in Python with matplotlib. One thing I haven&#x27;t found on Hackage is something to handle the serialization step -- ideally, I&#x27;d like to take an HMatrix object (or some other equivalent) and just call a function to write it to a file. Does anyone know of a good solution for that? Otherwise, what are some nice, ergonomic (preferably matplotlib-like) plotting libraries?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, please bear with me as my core talents are not in programming but I’m interested in learning Haskell and generally inspired by the project and community.
 I have two projects in mind. One is to build a user friendly app on the web for general budgeting, and for more advanced cases; financial modelling and business use. This is a product idea, but my heart is really in number theory and various applied areas of mathematics. So second idea is to build a function library for a similar calculator catering to that. I know there’s good stuff out there but partly it is to develop my skills and understanding. 
 Is Haskell suitable for this? Would it be unwise to try hit two birds at once and just have a common library? Or should I keep the product idea seperate and use a more commonly understood language like python? Much thanks in advance!

In the case of the Scala standard library, I only receive a message stating &quot;No information available&quot; (as shown in screenshot 3). Have you ever encountered this situation, or is there something I might be overlooking?

 screenshot 2: hover on std library

                              <span>Hey all - just throwing this out to see if anyone understands what is going on in the industry? At this time last year after my contract ran out recruiters were knocking down my door trying to get my 10+ years of functional Scala experience to one of their many clients that wanted it. This year after a similar situation I am being rejected by 9/10 applications off the rip and those I have gotten an interview with have either ghosted or rejected and my previous recruiters have nothing in their pipelines. Now I know there are several variables that could be at play but I can&#x27;t remember ever having such bad luck in my entire career at least getting in the door somewhere. Does anyone have any advice, commiseration or burning desire to team up and start a consulting company?

An alternative frontend for Haskell? by gilmi
In this post I’ll explore 11 ideas I would pursue if I were to build an alternative syntax for Haskell (a new compiler frontend for a modified language that compiles to GHC Haskell source code) to solve some of the most repeated complaints about Haskell.

In this blog post,
we will learn how to include Bayesian machine learning in a reactive rhine application.
Imagine a program that reacts in real time to a sensor input:
It might be a robot, an app using GPS data on a phone,
or a device to track an object’s location.
Also assume that we have some prior knowledge about how this data is produced,
so it makes sense to express this knowledge as a Bayesian model,
and use Bayesian machine learning to infer the best estimate of the state of the robot, phone, or object.
Then our program should be able to react continuously in real time to this estimate.
There exist numerous libraries for Bayesian modelling and inference, such as Stan, PyMC, and (in Haskell) monad-bayes,
but it is not straightforw…</span>

 If I copy them to another buffer, they turn out to be a backtick followed by two spaces: &quot;&#x60; &quot;.
 Does anybody know how to get rid of them?
 I tried downloading the latest eglot (rather than using the one that comes with Emacs 29) and setting &#x27;eglot-prefer-plaintext&#x27; to &#x27;t&#x27;, but this got rid of all syntax highlighting.

                              <span>In my quest to create a personalized note-taking system, I chose to use Emacs. While I&#x27;m aware of various existing packages like roam, zk, and org-journal, I wanted a solution that precisely catered to my needs, without unnecessary features or the loss of essential ones. This drove me back to Emacs from Logseq, as I realized I only required a simple system for taking daily notes.
 With that in mind, I crafted a configuration to facilitate note-taking and accomplished a feature I had long desired: integration with Raindrop to fetch my bookmarks. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward process.
 This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the versatility of Emacs, allowing it to be tailored to meet one&#x27;s unique requirements. I&#x27;m now fully immersed in the world of Emacs.
 Feel free to take a look at my configuration and offer any tips, code suggestions, or ideas on how to further enhance, simplify, or expand it. You can find the configuration here:

Every once in a while, it&#x27;ll get &quot;out of sync&quot; from the buffer. i.e. even after I correct the syntax error it reports, it still sends the old code to LSP, and therefore keeps reporting the fixed errors.
 &#x60;elgot-reconnect&#x60; fixes it, but it&#x27;s really not a solution to call &#x60;eglot-reconnect&#x60; every 10 minutes.

                              <span>Hey friends! I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and have vc-gutter enabled. When I make changes, a single character (for example &#x3D; pops up on the left side of the line numbers. This has the effect of shifting the line numbers and all content of the buffer to the right. Ideally, I&#x27;d just like the column to ALWAYS be present even if there are no changes. I tried modifying multiple variables, but I believe all the fringe ones are for graphical. Does anyone have guidance? Thanks! 
 Update: git-gutter:hide-gutter is already set to nil and it doesn&#x27;t seem to preserve that column.

                              <span>Hello to all, As some of you probably did, i jumped on the treesitter train with emacs 29.1.
 I replaced my major modes by their ts counterparts, and gave it a try. For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. 
 Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules. I have used mainly the following so far : - cmake-ts-mode - c++-ts-mode - yaml-ts-mode
 Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or &quot;fix&quot; indentation rules to my liking.
 On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily
 On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. 
 I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze. 
 How has your treesitter Journey been so far ?

 I would like to simplify my file and use variables for some file locations (using a variable in agenda section, etc).
 What is the right way to do that in lisp?
 Is it as simple as this?

 (setq linux-file-location &#x27;(&quot;/home/username/Desktop/filename.org&quot;))

 I have read (but not tested it yet) that logseq has a module to browse or search in the Discogs DB, and I thought &quot;pffff.... emacs has it for years already&quot;... but I hardly find anything on this topic.
 I have found an old project on github from Mineo regarding Musicbrainzm but I was expecting more.
 Is there any reason for this lack of solutions?
 I am no developer, I am not complaining, but I am surprised, this is probably the first domain where I can not find a good solution for my needs with emacs (I may also have poorly searched, would it be the case, please show me the path to the truth!!!!) 
 Any idea why? Thx for your insights!

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Does anyone know if there is a plugin for Emacs that offers like a popup where you search recent files.
 Right now I use counsel and it works in minibuffer below...but I saw a video where you could have that working like a mid-screen popup and search files.

                              <span>Is there a way I can compile then run my compiled application, if its already running then exit recompile and run.
 So current work flow is compile switch to terminal run binary, switch back make changes compile return to terminal Ctrl + C to kill then run again, be nice if I could do all this from inside emacs.
 I guess a bash script could be an option but curious if others have this work flow and how it works ?
 Currently in a golang workflow but even better if there is a generic solution.

                              <span>I use Consult, Vertico and orderless in my config. But when I am looking for a file (consult-ls-git) I would like it not to include subpath or the path when filtering the results, or if it&#x27;s possible to show matches in filename first - so they have more score for the sorting. Is this possible. 
 /LoginView/SomeFile.swift
 /LoginView/LoginView.swift 
 Right now I would get this when I type &quot;Login&quot;, that fine but if it&#x27;s not possible to exclude non matching files, I would like the LoginView to be the first choice.

 but I rather have everything hapenning in one go, using the q letter for this. (lazyvim sems to have that setup by default which i seems to have got used to it)
 It&#x27;s easy enough to redefine an object like this:
 (define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map &quot;q&quot; &#x27;evil-a-double-quote) (define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map &quot;q&quot; &#x27;evil-inner-double-quote) 
 which obviously only select the double quotes, anyone would know how to extend this to backquote &#x60; or single quote &#x27;

                              <span>I don&#x27;t want to create 2 extra endpoints because otherwise it would be an API change (to the outside). 
 What I want is to have an endpoint that if it optionally gets a header Accept -&gt; text/event-stream, it executes logic A, otherwise logic B.
 Anyone have any ideas, thanks in advance.
 scala // with optional header &quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;text/event-stream&quot; // real stream with single datapoints def a &#x3D; endpoint .post .in(&quot;data&quot;) .in(clientIp) .in(pathBindables) .in(jsonBody[DataQuery]) .errorOut(stringBody) .out(serverSentEventsBody[IO]) 
 scala def b &#x3D; endpoint .post .in(&quot;data&quot;) .in(clientIp) .in(pathBindables) .in(jsonBody[DataQuery]) .errorOut(jsonBody[ErrorMessage]) .out(streamBody(Fs2Streams[IO])(sttp.tapir.Schema.any[Stream[IO, Byte]], CodecFormat.Json.apply()))

                              <span>Hi ! 
 I am looking for a working example of an import of a package from Github Packages Maven repository using scala-cli. 
 My use case would be to import libs shared internally in my company org. And if I get it working for private packages, then it should work for public ones too ! 
 Currently I have :
 scala-cli config --dump
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json
 { &quot;repositories&quot;: { &quot;credentials&quot;: [{&quot;host&quot;:&quot;https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;value:PrivateToken&quot;,&quot;password&quot;:&quot;env:GITHUB_TOKEN&quot;,&quot;matchHost&quot;:true}]
 } }
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and the following using directives 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; //&gt; using repository &quot;https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG&quot; //&gt; using lib &quot;my.org::my-lib:0.1.0&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which yields an unauthorized error on import.
 I also tried setting the repositories.credential.host to maven.pkg.github.com and maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG without success. 
 As for the repository in the using directive I have also tried ( not sure if I tried every combination of both ): - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/_ - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/REPO_OF_MY_LIB
 I am sure the token works. The unauthorized error seem to indicate either the crednetials are not passed or I am targeting the wrong URLs. Any idea on what&#x27;s wrong with my setup ?

                              <span>Slipped in between paragraphs about being worried that her family&#x27;s hiding place will be discovered by a new building owner and the fairness of rationing butter, Anne Frank mentions being gifted a zettelkasten to track her reading:

  
Father emptied a card file for Margot and me and filled it with index cards that are blank on one side. This is to become our reading file, in which Margot and I are supposed to note down the books we’ve read, the author and the date.


Niklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927-1998), famous for his own 90,000+ slip reading file, was a year and a half older than Anne Frank (June 12, 1929-1945) who received her first card index file in February 1943 (likely between the 27th, the date of her diary entry mentioning it and the prior diary entry on February 5th). It was given to her by her father at the age of 13. As would have been commonplace, she was intended to use it as a &quot;reading file&quot; to note down the books she&#x27;d read along with the author and the date.
One can only wonder at how many entries she would have made over the span of her life had it not come to such an abrupt end.

                              <span>It would be really nice to have everything in org mode, but I continually find myself coming back to planning with paper for all but the toy cases.
 It would be really nice, as a Computer Person, to have all of my notes and project management in a computer system. For instance, I have to manage my work sprints using Linear. But I find that org mode, and to some extent emacs, has too much friction for my liking.
 In the first place, it is not trivial to use with a mobile phone. Right now I have an emacs instance running inside termux, and notes have to be ported over with Syncthing. This necessitates (at least ideally) running a spare machine 24/7 to sync with. Not to mention that using my smartphone probably increases my risk of cancer at least slightly.
 If I have to write something down, I&#x27;m reluctant to open a new emacs window, navigate to my buffer, and then write down the point.
 Also, the default org-agenda views are much inferior to the typical calendar or timetable.
 Sorry for the emotional nature of this post. I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anybody was in a similar place, and where they ended up going.

                              <span>Some context: I&#x27;m a Java programmer, but I don&#x27;t like it. I have a background in mathematics so naturally I am interested in (pure) functional programming. At my dayjob, I have expressed my feelings towards Java and expressed I would like to do something more &quot;mathematically motivated&quot; and coined Scala and their effect systems as examples. My teamlead, who himself is a developer, wanted me to give him a bit more of an explanation of what I meant by this, so I set out to gather some information I can present to him.
 But
 I am confused as to how I can unite the following two descriptions of effects:
  
Rob Norris in his talk &#x27;Functional Programming with Effects&#x27; talks about mathematical functions and then talks about effects as basically ways to be able to do the stuff we&#x27;re used to in programming like functions not being total, mutability, ... He then talks about the 6 most known &#x27;effects&#x27; and wants to be able to compose them, then concludes that basically an effect is an &#x60;F[_]&#x60; which is a Monad.
 Cats-Effect, from the docs says that their typeclass hierarchy describe, fundamentally, what it means to be a functional effect. But their typeclass hierarchy is for their specific runtime and focusses almost exclusively on asynchrony, parallelism and concurrency. I don&#x27;t see &#x60;Option&#x60; or &#x60;Either&#x60; fitting in here.
  
So what gives? I am really confused at this point, but I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. 
 Bonus question: In the same talk, Rob Norris says that there are a lot of other effects out there. How do I find them? This sounds silly, but does he just mean like &quot;custom monads&quot; that we might define in our business which are only applicable in our custom business environment, or does he mean more powerful abstractions which are just more complex than the ones he showed?

                              <span>Does anybody have a good resource about emacs29 tree-sitter indentation? In particular I&#x27;m interested on not indenting inside namespaces for C/C++ styles.
 With cc-mode this works: (c-set-offset &#x27;innamespace [0]), for example.
 This is what I have so far that, of course, it is not working:
 &#x60;&#x60; (use-package c++-ts-mode :ensure nil ;; emacs built-in :preface (defun my/c-ts-indent-style() (;; do not indent namespace children ((parent-is &quot;namespace_definition&quot;) parent-bol 0)
  ;; append to bsd style ,@(alist-get &#x27;bsd (c-ts-mode--indent-styles &#x27;cpp)))) :bind (:map c++-ts-mode-map (&quot;M-&quot; . treesit-beginning-of-defun) (&quot;M-&quot; . treesit-end-of-defun)) :config (setq c-ts-mode-indent-offset 4) (setq c-ts-mode-indent-style #&#x27;my/c-ts-indent-style)) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 SOLUTION: In another thread my question was answered, here&#x27;s the link to that thread if anybody is interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16zhgrd/comment/k4aw2yi/?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3

                              <span>I have a latex header in my org document which changes the default verbatim environment to something where it&#x27;s boxed and says RESULTS above it. I&#x27;d like to define a new verbatim environment for results, s.t...
 #+results: #+begin_example hello world #+end_example 
 or...
 #+results: : hello world 
 get transcoded to LaTeX as...
 \begin{results} hello world \end{results} 
 while something like...
 #+begin_example hello world #+end_example 
 gets transcoded as...
 \begin{verbatim} hello world \end{verbatim} 
 Any help is appreciated (also, as a side note, wasn&#x27;t there a way to get syntax highlighting inside example blocks? I could be wrong, but I thought I did this at one point).

I have been facing this friction when i want to switch editors from vim (neovim ) to emacs that i am very accustom to my keybinds in vim and i use those binds everywhere possible in my browser in pycharm , c lion , vs code if i ever have to use that Question i want to ask is this : if i use vim bindings inside emacs (i heard that you can do that and that made me want to try emacs) how far can i go before i hit the limit of what&#x27;s possible using emacs , will i have to switch back and learn normal emacs key bindings to use advanced features and configure it to my liking is there a hard limit to the customizations you can do with vim bindings this may seem like a stupid question but this thought of keep using vim bindings in emacs and then having to relearn all of the muscle memory again is keeping me from trying it , but i want to use something like emacs for my personal development all the time for now on to forever it is advisable to use emacs on windows system or should i get started with it inside my Wsl system any recommendations, suggestions , roadmap to learn emcas better and efficiently is very well appreciated ,any links to videos articles blogs and resources for learning are appreciated as well

                              <span>If you would have the power to change any Emacs-default setting, what would that be and why?
 What kind of setting do you think would be useful for a lot (or a majority) of Emacs-users?
 One of my examples:
 (fido-vertical-mode t)
 Because seeing a list of candidates as you type and being able to choose from it with meaningful key-bindings is way more convenient and efficient than the tab-completion-system (I think this claim is backed by the way all those external packages work; helm, ivy, vertico). This is especially suited for a default because you can still use the tab-completion-system with it. So nobody needs to change habits.

 I just fired up magit to merge my dev branch into master, and somehow the keys have changed or are not working. I used to hit &quot;b l&quot; to checkout a local branch (in this case master) where I&#x27;d then merge dev into it, push it to github, and then checkout out dev again.
 I get this message:-
 ​
  
&quot;transient-setup: Suffix magit-branch.
.merge/remote is not defined or autoloaded as a command&quot;
  
Hopefully someone here has recently done the slog and can save this lazy individual some time. What changed? I havent touched my magit setup for literally years.
 (magit-checkout from minibuffer works fine).

                              <span>In this post I share a basic model built in Haskell to help plan for education expenses (or other large, future, time-bounded expenses).
 This beginner-friendly post demonstrates many simple Haskell functions, especially for working with lists. It also shows how to build and execute stateful computations using State
 from mtl. I (mostly) avoid type signatures and just focus on defining the terms, but there are plenty of links to API documentation. At the end of the post I suggest some enhancements to the model that would be good exercises for learners (and might be fun even for more experienced Haskell programmers).

                              <span>I periodically run an emacs batch command using (org-store-agenda-views) to generate plain text and html versions of my org-agenda. This process works fine generally.
 However, some of my TODO headlines contain org-formatted links (i.e. within the headline). In both the .txt and .html generated files, these links appear with the full text of the org link - i.e. with [[link destination][link title]] visible in the generated/viewed file - rather than just &#x27;link title&#x27;.
 Is this expected behaviour? Are there any settings that affect this behaviour? I would prefer not to see the full org link source in the generated files.
 (I&#x27;m currently running org version 9.6.10 and emacs 29.1 on Linux. When I first started generating these agenda files, the links in headlines exported correctly. I suspect that the current behaviour began after an org version upgrade, but I cannot remember which one, and have just been living with it since.)

 end up w/ preceding commas. I&#x27;ve tried w/ emacs -q and I have the same issue. Is there any short term fix for this?
 ​
 UPDATE
 I realize now this is a quoting mechanism to prevent confusion inside an org document, and that this should not be removed. Instead is there a good way to font lock these commas so that they are barely visible?

                              <span>Hello, I’m after some help please? I have this installed from Melba and when I do any sort of docker list commands images, containers etc the buffer opens with the correct headers but no content. I can run docker ps just fine on a term and get results, I’m in the docker group so no audio or root required. I have removed any options relating to docker from my init.el. Any thoughts on how I can debug this?

                              <span>In deadgrep, I&#x27;m having a hard time using the glob option to exclude files. Using rg globs, I can do something like rg Foo -g &#x27;!gtest*cpp&#x27; to exclude all of my gtest files.
 In deadgrep, the same glob filter, !gtest*cpp returns NO results. If I remove the exclude, !, I ONLY get gtest*cpp results.
 Does deadgrep handle excluding glob patterns differently?

                              <span>Hi fellow r/emacs ers,
 I am trying to have fzf working under windows 10 in emacs. So far, calling it with M-x only show errors:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Spawning child process&quot; &quot;Invalid argument&quot;) make-process(:name &quot;fzf&quot; :buffer # :command (&quot;/bin/sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;stty -nl echo rows 20 columns 80 sane 2&gt;NUL;if [ $...&quot; &quot;..&quot; &quot;sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) start-process(&quot;fzf&quot; # &quot;/bin/sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;stty -nl echo rows 20 columns 80 sane 2&gt;NUL;if [ $...&quot; &quot;..&quot; &quot;sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;) term-exec-1(&quot;fzf&quot; # &quot;sh&quot; (&quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) term-exec(# &quot;fzf&quot; &quot;sh&quot; nil (&quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) make-term(&quot;fzf&quot; &quot;sh&quot; nil &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;) fzf--start(nil fzf--action-find-file) fzf(nil) funcall-interactively(fzf nil) command-execute(fzf record) execute-extended-command(nil &quot;fzf&quot; #(&quot;fzf&quot; 0 3 (face (nano-strong nano-salient)))) funcall-interactively(execute-extended-command nil &quot;fzf&quot; #(&quot;fzf&quot; 0 3 (face (nano-strong nano-salient)))) command-execute(execute-extended-command)  I do not know why /bin/sh is called
 I have Msys64 installed, fzf works in my terminal. I also have bash.exe working fine.
 In emacs, I have modified these variables in order to have bash.exe called instead of /bin/sh
  
sh-shell is set to bash
 sh-shell-file is set to the path to bash.exe
  
I have also search for mentions of /bin/sh using deadgrep... nothing useful. I do not know what to do.
 please help me fix this problem. thx

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am a big user of GMail&#x27;s &quot;Scheduled Send&quot; feature. It allows me to reply at my pace and make sure the thread does not become a ping-pong match and replies won&#x27;t come back earlier than expected.
 How to do that &quot;on my own&quot;? I use notmuch + msmtp (within emacs) to handle most of my email but like half of it I have to manage via Gmail&#x27;s web interface because of the scheduling needs.
 I know about msmtp-queue but it is a all or nothing solution. I would love to be able to schedule my emails, either at Emacs level or SMTP level, with some header or something.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Has anyone been able to get xwidget-webkit to work under Wayland? I saw that support for pgtk was added a couple of years ago so I decided to give it a whirl. Compiled emacs 29.1 on Linux x86_64 with webkit2gtk-2.42.1 and the configure options &#x60;--with-xwidgets&#x60; and &#x60;--with-pgtk&#x60;. I tried opening a url with &#x60;xwidget-webkit-browse-url&#x60;, but emacs crashed with the error:
 &quot;ERROR **: 12:43:15.326: GDK is not able to create a GL context: The current backend does not support OpenGL.&quot;
 which is weird, because &#x60;eglinfo&#x60; does not report anything out of the ordinary. 
 xwidgets has always been finicky for me and there&#x27;s very little information available on the internet so I&#x27;d be interested in knowing if others have got it to work and it&#x27;s just a problem with my setup.

                              <span>I would like to use gnuplot to make a linear regression on data with org / babel
 I try to get the output of the fit function (it should be plain text), but there is nothing appearing
 Here is a sample for the source block in org file
 #+begin_src gnuplot :export both :results output $data &lt;&lt; EOD 140 492 150 482 160 474 EOD f(x) &#x3D; m*x + b fit f(x) $data using 1:2 via m,b #+end_src #+RESULTS: 
 No result is shown.
 If I type this into gnuplot directly I get following output
 iter chisq delta/lim lambda m b 0 3.3073100000e+05 0.00e+00 1.06e+02 1.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 1 1.0051585134e+04 -3.19e+06 1.06e+01 2.884742e+00 1.013012e+00 2 3.3702517596e+03 -1.98e+05 1.06e+00 3.198022e+00 1.063524e+00 3 3.3179216992e+03 -1.58e+03 1.06e-01 3.166605e+00 5.868544e+00 4 1.0413329062e+03 -2.19e+05 1.06e-02 1.377710e+00 2.749980e+02 5 8.3116008254e-01 -1.25e+08 1.06e-03 -8.713637e-01 6.133585e+02 6 6.6666666933e-01 -2.47e+04 1.06e-04 -8.999964e-01 6.176661e+02 7 6.6666666667e-01 -4.00e-04 1.06e-05 -9.000000e-01 6.176667e+02 iter chisq delta/lim lambda m b After 7 iterations the fit converged. final sum of squares of residuals : 0.666667 rel. change during last iteration : -3.9991e-09 degrees of freedom (FIT_NDF) : 1 rms of residuals (FIT_STDFIT) &#x3D; sqrt(WSSR/ndf) : 0.816497 variance of residuals (reduced chisquare) &#x3D; WSSR/ndf : 0.666667 Final set of parameters Asymptotic Standard Error &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; m &#x3D; -0.9 +/- 0.05774 (6.415%) b &#x3D; 617.667 +/- 8.673 (1.404%) correlation matrix of the fit parameters: m b m 1.000 b -0.999 1.000 
 which I would like to see directly inside of the org file. 
 Has anybody an idea, what I am doing wrong?

                              <span>I use org-roam-bibtex to manage bibliography notes, and use org-roam capture templates to create roam nodes associated with each reference in my bibliography.
 The org-roam-bibtex context allows for access to some bibliography entry fields like the path to the PDF file on my system. I&#x27;d like to org-attach this PDF to a heading that expands in the org-capture template while retaining the option :immediate-finish t. Is this a possibility?

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t developed or even looked at the source code of either. So I suppose I&#x27;m asking those who have.
 IntelliJ&#x27;s Scala plugin really doesn&#x27;t work too well. I really like IntelliJ&#x27;s IDEA, but it&#x27;s substantially harder to debug Scala 3 in my experience.
 I&#x27;m aware there are LSP servers for IntelliJ. How outlandish would it be use Metals in IntelliJ?
 (I&#x27;m asking out of curiosity, even if I could, I&#x27;m more of a VSCode user)

Ideas I&#x27;m thinking about:
Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics
OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT as writing tutor
Should I quit? It would free me to switch to a more worthy, interesting opportunity. Something more in line with my goals.
Do I know what it means to write for the benefit of others?
Interstitial Journaling
The Indian Monk Tilopa&#x27;s Six Nails and how they relate to mindfulness.
I&#x27;m thinking about the tension between what is easy, fun, and comfortable and what adds value to my life.
How do I physically review my ZK notes and journal entries? How do I make sense of this process? How do I connect with what is valuable in this process?
The ephemerality of thought.
Self-mentoring.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Emerson, Hannah and Martin, Chris and Nisinzweig, Aviv. The kissing of kissing: poems. 2022.
Davis, Lydia. Essays one. 2020.
Chabon, Michael. The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union. 2008.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
SUSS
Jazz for Study
Jeff Oster - howling loon
★★★★★
The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

I have tried to map a universal keyboard shortcut in System Settings -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts -&gt; App Shortcuts -&gt; New Item to The Archive&#x27;s &quot;Switch Archives...&quot; Command.
For some reason, it won&#x27;t work for me.  Any insight into why that is?</span>

This is a story of how I recently had a problem and I came up with a cool way to solve it using dired, registers, regex, and macros. In particular, I realized I could maintain state during macro execution using a register. IMO I found a cool solution and I&#x27;m proud of myself.

 Today I would like to share another package for FPGA &amp; ASIC development: fpga.el
 - https://github.com/gmlarumbe/fpga
 ​
 It provides features for major vendors and open source tools:
  
Xilinx, Altera, Lattice, Cadence, Siemens, Synopsys and Yosys tools
 Synthesis/simulation compilation modes for error regexp matching: 
 Colorize error codes and jump to files where errors appeared
 
 Interactive shells with syntax highlighting and auto-completion
 Major-modes with syntax highlighting and auto-completion: 
 Vivado XDC major-mode
 Quartus SDC and QSF major-modes
 Cadence vManager VSIF major-mode
 Yosys script major-mode
 
 Global Gtags creation from files in Vivado XPR and Quartus QPF project files
 And some others...
  
​
 A couple of demo videos and screenshots:

 #+PLOT: title:&quot;What off-task behaviors are you doing during virtual meetings?&quot; ind:1 deps:(2) type:2d with:histograms set:&quot;yrange [0:]&quot; |  |  | | Task | Percentage (%) of respondants | |----------------------------+-------------------------------| | Checking emails | 55 | | Cellphone/Texting | 51 | | Multitasking | 51 | | Snack | 45 | | Social Media | 39 | | Surf the internet | 33 | | Daydreaming | 23 | | Socializing with coworkers | 21 | | Doodling/drawing | 19 | | Household activities | 16 | | Childcare | 9 | | Video Games | 9 | | Other | 7 | 
 When I press &#x27;C-c &quot; g&quot;, the labels on the X-axis are scrunched up. Is there any way I can make the bar chart horizontal to avoid this?

                              <span>I’m using a monospace font that supports variable weights. In some applications you can specify the weight as a number between 1 - 1000, similar to CSS. For example, iAWriter supports this.
 Is there a way to set a custom weight in emacs? I’d like more fine grained control than light, regular, medium, etc.

 Screenshot of Emacs with three Eat terminals and a Eshell. Upper-left: line mode Upper-right: Sixel. Lower-left: Eat running Emacs, using truecolor support. Lower-right: Eat inside Eshell.
 Eat 0.9 has been released! 🎉
 Notable changes include:
  
Support for Emacs 26
 Sixel support
 Line mode (like Term mode&#x27;s one)
 Various bug fixes (including that cursor jumping bug).
  
Eat is a reasonably fast terminal emulator for Emacs written entirely in Emacs Lisp, with various features like shell intergration, 24bit colors, complete mouse support and Sixel support, etc. It can run most (if not all) full-screen terminal programs. It also allows to run full-screen programs in Eshell.

                              <span>I am writing a small major mode in Emacs, and I want to add some support for when electrc-*-modes are enabled.
 In particular, I need the following functionality:
  
Automatic newline when | is typed; and
 Indent and newline when [ is typed.
  
I have been looking into different ways of doing this, and I have come up with the following:
  
Using electric-layout-mode, e.g. (add-to-list &#x27;electric-layout-rules &#x27;(?| . before)); and
 Using electric-indent-mode, e.g. (setq-local electric-indent-chars (append electric-indent-chars &#x27;(?\[))).
  
I have also read about the electric-pairs-mode which might be more appropriate for the latter. There are also more manual ways of doing this, with hooks (post self insert hooks?).
 However, I am struggling to find any documentation on any electric functions, and different other major modes do these kind of things in different ways. My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after? If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better. But maybe it&#x27;s best that I keep these separate in case the user wants to enable, for example, layout mode but not pairs mode.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from developers of major modes with experience implementing such a feature!

                              <span>Typst is a very young but very promising markup language with use-cases similar to LaTeX. One big objective advantage of typst over LaTeX is compilation speed.
 For that reason alone, it would be nice to be able to export org to PDF through typst.
 Does anyone have a fledgling ox-typst implementation (open to contributions)?

But there&#x27;s one little annoyance that I&#x27;m not able to get rid off. That is, whenever I start emacs, it opens up with *elpaca-log* buffer. Is this the default behaviour? Or is it happening only with me because of my config? How can I fix this?

 In this post I will show how to significantly improve the performance of combinator based reducers by using a alternative abstraction algorithms. These algorithms are based on the paper λ to SKI, Semantically by Oleg Kiselyov and closely follow Ben Lynn’s implementation of Kiselyov’s ideas.
 I will also give detailed comparisons of the different approaches regarding emitted code size and execution performance on different reducers.

                              <span>TL;DR: New to Haskell and looking for an existing tool that can automatically insert traceShow statements for debugging. Also open to alternative suggestions or better ways to debug. Thanks in advance! 
 Hello, Haskell enthusiasts! 👋
 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and I&#x27;ve been exploring the language through a project I&#x27;m working on. To debug my code, I&#x27;ve been manually inserting &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements from the Debug.Trace module. While I find this method effective, it&#x27;s also quite time-consuming.
 Problem Statement:
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s an existing tool that can automate the insertion of &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements into Haskell code at key points. This would significantly streamline my debugging process.
 haskell
 -- Example: Original Code getMiddle2 :: String -&gt; String getMiddle2 sourceString | isOddLength &#x3D; takeMiddle 1 | otherwise &#x3D; takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength &#x3D; length sourceString ... 
 What I Would Like the Tool to Produce:
 haskell
 -- Example: With traceShow statements getMiddle2 :: String -&gt; String getMiddle2 sourceString | traceShow (&quot;Checking isOddLength:&quot;, isOddLength) isOddLength &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Taking middle 1:&quot;, takeMiddle 1) takeMiddle 1 | otherwise &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Taking middle 2:&quot;, takeMiddle 2) takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Source Length:&quot;, sourceLength) length sourceString ... 
 What I&#x27;ve Considered:
 I&#x27;ve thought about crafting a tool myself that involves parsing the Haskell source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traversing this tree to insert &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements. But before going down that rabbit hole, I wanted to consult the community. Is there already a tool out there that can help me with this?
 Open to Suggestions:
 Being new to Haskell, I&#x27;m also open to any advice or alternative approaches for debugging or learning the language. If there&#x27;s a better way to do things, I&#x27;m all ears! 🐰
 Thank you for any recommendations, experiences, or advice you can share. I appreciate it! 🙏

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am delving into the development of a turn-based card game and exploring technology stack options. Considering the essential need for distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-availability systems in the game, I am leaning towards utilizing Scala and Akka. The revenue scope of the project stays within the bounds making Akka usage free. 
 Here are a few points I&#x27;m pondering upon:
  
How effective is Akka in managing distributed systems for a gaming application, especially concerning fault tolerance and high availability?
 
For a turn-based card game, does Scala (along with Akka) provide a viable and efficient development pathway, or should I be looking at different languages/libraries?
 
If you have experience using Scala/Akka in game development, are there any pitfalls or challenges that you encountered which might be insightful for a beginner in this stack?
 
 Any insights, alternative suggestions, or experiences shared will be incredibly valuable. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey Scala devs,
 Quick question: why no colons in extension methods? Object and class declarations use colons to group things neatly (methods, fields), but extension methods don&#x27;t. What&#x27;s the rationale behind this syntax difference? Is it just a stylistic choice or something more?

                              <span>Hi, for a project I was trying to import the upickle dependency and added it to my build.sbt file in IntelliJ
 &quot;com.lihaoyi&quot; %% &quot;upickle&quot; % &quot;3.0.0&quot;
 Added to library dependencies, but when I try to do
 import upickle.default._
 It is saying that upickle is not found. Are there any solutions to getting the dependencies to update?

                              <span>I am at a Russel Group University for computer science and physics and I haven’t done programming for around 2 years since school. I did good at computer science at school with an A aswell as an A at maths and B at physics. This being said however, I’m finding it really difficult to understand my computing classes. We are doing Functional programming with Haskell and the only thing I have programmed in was Visual Basic. Does anyone have any advice on getting good grades/better at Haskell programming

                              <span>I can fold functions/methods/classes but not code blocks (e.g. for, if, ...) or doc strings.
 How can I achieve the latter? Which component is responsible? Which doc I should read?
 I do use Emacs 27 and 29 with eglot and evil-mode.

                              <span>OK, first of all, I&#x27;ve tried the orgmode and I think it&#x27;s awesome. I like a lot of the advantages that emacs provides not being restricted to being a terminal app. However, despite it&#x27;s huge potential, I don&#x27;t know how people use it productively, I mean afaik it&#x27;s as potent as an OS so you can do crazy things like &quot;making a script to get code from anywhere&quot; so... Basically I want to ask you about the features that you like the most. I&#x27;m not a guy who is going to use just ONE editor tho, I have to use VSCode for several stuff, I use orgmode for... well documenting, organizing (I should use the code features that it provides, which blew my mind) and oc I use nvim. I want to know what are the things that people do that boosted their productivity in emacs vs other editors, I think each one has their strengths and weaknesses. Ty in advance.

                              <span>Is it possible to add vertical space at the top and bottom of the frame? I&#x27;ve found a mode for centering horizontally (thx, olivetti) but I&#x27;d really like something for vertical space as well. Preferably, buffer-local (specifically my org-mode buffers).
 Some searching showed me some really hacky things like creating two windows at the top and bottom, abusing faces, and other things.
 This seems like a trivial thing. Is this really not built in? I can play pong, run a terminal, manage X windows, browse the web, but I can&#x27;t add top and bottom margin without hacks?

                              <span>Projectile seems intent on sub-dividing my npm-based monorepo despite having placed this defun specifying that it should only consider a project root if it&#x27;s a vc-root-dir:
 ;; we need this wrapper to match Projectile&#x27;s API (defun projectile-vc-root-dir (dir) &quot;Retrieve the root directory of the project at DIR using &#x60;vc-root-dir&#x27;.&quot; (let ((default-directory dir)) (vc-root-dir))) (setq projectile-project-root-functions &#x27;(projectile-vc-root-dir)) 
 That was taken line-for-line from the Projectile docs. Despite this, and despite nuking all of my Projectile projects/caches (to be 100% sure), anytime I open a library directory within my monorepo; Projectile will consider that a new project and act accordingly (i.e. I can no longer search outside of that library&#x27;s directory). To put it more explicitly:
 / monorepo-root | |--libraryA |--libraryB 
 ... when I initially enter my project and search for a file, I can see that Projectile is correctly searching through all directories. However, when I then enter into, say, libraryA and again try to search for files in the monorepo, Projectile is only searching under libraryA (I understand it as being seen as a different project in Projectile&#x27;s eyes).
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>When doing some functions like (shell-command) or (project-compile) the minibuffer has control of the cursor meaning the text can be manipulated using the various text editing commands. 
 When in I-search though the cursor only flashes to the minibuffer and then returns to the buffer so whenever I do the text editing commands it edits the actual buffer and not the I-search target phrase.
 Is there a way to make I-search take control of the cursor in a similar way to the others? I tried swiper which takes control but it is very slow for me when search large files ~3000 lines.

                              <span>Hi,
 now that the Matrix bridge for libera.chat is closed, I&#x27;m trying to use irc the proper way with an irc client.
 I&#x27;ve a ZNC server running and it expects username and password in this format username:password , but ERC expects it in two seperate fields, one for each.
 This is what I currently have in my config:
 ;; C-c erc, keybinding will start erc (global-set-key &quot;\C-cerc&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (erc-ssl :server &quot;zncserver.org&quot; :port &quot;6697&quot; :nick &quot;nickiename&quot; :password &quot;password123&quot;))) 
 and this is the format ZNC server instruction page has:
 /server zncserver.org 6697 username:password 
 When I try the above ERC config, connection to the ZNC server fails.
 Then I tried using :nick &quot;nickiename:password123&quot; format in above ERC config, then connection was sucessful however ERC doesn&#x27;t recognize the second half as password and uses the whole as nick and ZNC server asks for the password again.
 How can I resolve this issue?

                              <span>I was recently looking through someone&#x27;s .emacs repo and saw they were using use-package chords for avy. I decided to give it a try. I can see the potential but it seems too slow. I&#x27;m forced to pause typing for a moment to allow it to register the chord before I can choose the char to go-to.
 I attached a gif below first showing what it looks like with a pause and then what happens when I type all the necessary commands in sequence. (in my case jw for avy-got-word and then o to go to words beginning with &#x27;o&#x27;)
 my setup is shown below
 (use-package avy
 :chords
 (&quot;jw&quot; . avy-goto-word-1))
 Is there anything i can do to make it more smooth and reliable?

 I recently hopped on the Emacs train and I came across an article where this screenshot was shared. I really liked the colors, fonts and the way it just looked. I was wondering if that was an available theme to download and if anyone could point me to it. I tried image searching, looking maybe the Doom Emacs themes, but could not find something that resembles it.

 - This is a test #+caption: This is a test 
 gets rendered as...
 - This is a test caption: This is a test 
 This causes issues when working in org lists since the indentation breaks after the #+ lines. Is there a way to fix the rendering and indentation with org modern? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

 I wanted to share a new emacs package I&#x27;ve been working on, which is built on top of another project I created ~6 years ago. I let vzi bitrot for too long. I live inside emacs to the extent that I can, but one of the areas I&#x27;ve long been frustrated in is the ability to visualize data controlled from an emacs buffer. I&#x27;ve lately been enjoying deno, and got inspired and decided to finally rewrite vzi using it. Of course, I needed to be able to control it all from emacs with a few keystrokes, and hence vzi.el was born. If you are like me, you might appreciate these packages.
 The rough architecture of vzi is that it controls the browser remotely using the chrome devtools protocol, and pipes data to a host page from stdin. A final html report…</span>

                              <span>Hey all, anyone has tips on how I can replicate Neovims diff view merge request flow in Emacs/Magit. Diff view supports diffing a branch against master which opens up a side panel with the changes, with 2 code buffers- one old, one new/local - while having LSP support on the current branch. https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/blob/main/USAGE.md. Any idea if it’s possible to do something in Emacs?
 I’m not looking to leave comments directly in Emacs (yet). I just want to be able to compare the diffs with some code intelligence. Thanks!

                              <span>A tip and questions about org-table formulas.
 I often use the bottom of a table to calculate some statistics (here in this example it is always just the sum of the column). To easily deduce, what was calculated, I like to add a simple string to the result (in this example it is always &quot;Sum:&quot;). 
 Now here is an example with the various methods I know to achieve this:
 | just append | it fails | utilize calc | plain elisp | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | | 3 | - | - | - | | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | | 8 | - | - | - | | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 55 Sum | m | Sum: 44 | Sum: 44 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$1&#x3D;vsum(@I$1..@III$1) Sum #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vsum(@I$2..@III$2);N Sum #+TBLFM: @&gt;$3&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;Sum: %s&quot; (calcFunc-vsum @I$3..@III$3));N #+TBLFM: @&gt;$4&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;Sum: %i&quot; (apply #&#x27;+ (mapcar #&#x27;string-to-number &#x27;(@I$4..@III$4)))) 
 As you can see, the first method fails in the second column, due to not all data are numbers.
 Now my question(s): How do you deal with calculating some column statistical data and what do you do to identify the results later? Have you maybe written a nice wrapper around those methods to make them easier to write/use them as table formulas?

 According to C-h and this website, one needs to set org-support-shift-select-mode to always. However, adding the following line to my init.el does not have the desired effect:

 It doesn&#x27;t seem like chatgpt is tailored to emacs well enough. But in theory this should be possible to do right?

 I got tired of trying different calendar solutions in the desktop to manage appointments, when I take notes I want to refer to the dates of events, so it makes sense to keep it all in Emacs.
 There&#x27;s a lot of calendar/appointment options for org-mode, but I am not an org user, and was intrigued by the built in diary/calendar pair. After experimenting with them for a bit, and finding out there are built ins for:
 1. converting ics files to dairy-mode entries
 2. displaying notification for upcoming events
 3. communicating with DAV servers 
 I decided to try to build a package to sync events between diary files and a CalDAV server. I never quite figured out #3 but I was already so into the package that it didn&#x27;t matter :)
 There&#x27;s a plan to…</span>

 And this is how it looks like when I &#x60;cat&#x60; from terminal, when I run the script it runs fine so it definitely has to do with the way emacs indents the file.

 Indentation in emacs just looks wrong, is there anything I can do about?

                              <span>Org agenda is populated differently for today than for any other day. It fills the &quot;todo&quot; area with all the pending tasks. This is not done for any other day -- not for yesterday or for next month, when it shows only the agenda items that are active for that day or spanning that day. There are obvious performance reasons for this, and it is usually what I want -- except for when I am doing my daily journaling, when it would be massively useful to pull up the agenda AS IF I were on a previous day (usually &quot;yesterday&quot;). I only need this to be done once, for when I am journaling. How can I make a &quot;view as today&quot; command for my orgmode agenda?

 Does anyone know a fix for this.

                              <span>An active chat room helps a project grow and improve faster. The cabal project has been making great use of theirs (#hackage on Libera IRC), but it seemed to me that there was no equivalent for stack users and devs. I did some digging and discovered four stack-related chat rooms:
  
#stack-users and #stack-collaborators on the Haskell Foundation slack (the current maintainer is there)
 #haskell-stack on Libera IRC
 #haskell-stack:matrix.org on Matrix (created in 2018; was bridged to Libera for a while; the past and current maintainers are there)
  
All of these are currently low activity, but the Matrix room in particular has recently been spruced up and I&#x27;d like to invite you there to get and give help. Stack users, stack developers, stackage curators, haskell package maintainers, interested spectators - all are welcome. Hope to see you there!

Ian or &quot;zenhack&quot; may not have been the biggest name in the community, but I remember how obviously brilliant and eager to share with others he was. 
 Anyways, I guess I am just sharing because I hope that others can appreciate the work Ian has done and pick up the torch. Others who were closer have written kind words as well:

Convenience in the Haskell ecosystem by bradrn
My motivation yesterday was wanting to do a spot of data analysis. Nothing complicated: essentially, I just needed to plot some fields from a JSON file.
Episode 34 – Lindsey Kuper by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra chat with Lindsey Kuper, Assistant Professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. They discuss what to do when your data center gets hit by a tornado, life in academia versus life in industry, and what is choreographic programming.

Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult
to use.

Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user
interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium:
Simplicity: Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often
not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways,
leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers.
Memorability: How does one remember all those different options?
It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking
the usage text, man pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour.
Discoverability: Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know
(or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full

 I&#x27;ve written a function &quot;custoEnergia&quot; which receives two parameters: &quot;salário&quot; and &quot;energia&quot;. It is defined just like this:.
 custoEnergia salario energia &#x3D; salario/ 5 * energia * 0.85
 The &quot;problem&quot; here is that the result is being truncated up to 2 decimals. I&#x27;d like it not to behave like this and show all numbers after the decimal.

                              <span>Hey folks, I created a toy clone of git using Haskell. I have been on and off learning Haskell for a while but never really did anything practical using it. Most resources (that I encountered) just teach you what monads are and that&#x27;s about it. I had the hang of monads for a while but never really had the confidence to make something practical using Haskell.
 Recently I decided to change that by doing some practical stuff using Haskell. So I present to you Hagit: A git clone written in Haskell. It is fairly limited but if you really try you can actually do version control using it (at least locally). It can also clone a repo.
 I have also extensively documented what I have done. As for how my experience was, I really enjoyed it, baring a few annoyances. The code is probably not idiomatic, as this is more or less my first attempt at making something practical with Haskell. If you have some time at your hand and want to dive into git internals please give it a read (the readme has links to 3 articles that have the details) and if possible please suggest what I could have done better.

                              <span>Packages are also used for distribution: the idea is that a package can be created in one place and be moved to a different computer and be usable in that different environment.
  
But that&#x27;s not true! I can&#x27;t give you a Haskell library package, not even in source form, and have it be usable in your environment!
 Cabal packages can only reference other packages in one of three cases:
  
If the package is available on Hackage.
 If both packages are part of the same directory structure.
 If the referencing package hardcodes the exact path to the referenced package.
  
None of those is suitable for third-party distribution of packages outside of Hackage!
 How is a package usable on another computer if it hard-codes the exact location of every dependency it has?
 C has an include path. Java has an include path. Why does Haskell require a .cabal file to hard code the path to all of its dependencies?!

Passing arguments as header args, and 2.) Treating org files as executables without a harness (or maybe a very lightweight one).

                              <span>Looking for a comfortable way to use emacs for ssh-ing to the servers of our company, but still having issues. Non solution is ideal. I have to use a proxy command to login as a user and after logged in can use sudo to get root.
 My preferred solution in emacs would be eshells cd /ssh: way. With this I also have the default directory synchronized and can easily use C-x C-f to edit files. Tab completion works too, as long I do not sudo -i .
 If I do - completions will break, which is not ideal because I have several scripts in the root path which I need to complete.
 If I leave the eshell way and use mx-shell oder eat-shell etc. I will have tab completion everywhere but the directory is not synched.
 I know I can just type C-x C-f /ssh:user@host|sudo::/file
 But the hostnames we are using are quite long and generic. So this would be a bit of a hazzle.
 Does anyone has a hint for me how I could come around this?
 My last idea would be a small function which gets the hostname from the eat buffer and triggers find-files with the correct path. But maybe there is something better and yes - I would prefer eshell for the whole thing.

                              <span>I have a laptop, work laptop, and monitor all of different resolutions. The two laptops have different default font sizes in my init, and when they&#x27;re plugged into the monitor, I need to manually adjust each frame for the font to be readable. Is there any way to make Emacs automatically adjust the font-size so that it increases until it can fit fill-column within the frame?

 This is mostly to put a stable tag on a bunch of changes that have been in master for a while (and to justify some riskier changes next). But hopefully some will find this list useful anyway.

 But the port is always 25. If I manually run this code from the scratch buffer, it changes fine, and I can send mail correctly. Happens when using both mail and compose-mail.
 Anyone knows what might cause this?

                              <span>Since installing Firefox on Debian via flatpak, so that I can keep up with the latest version instead of the apt realease, Emacs is erroring whenever I try to open org links for example, with &#x27;Searching for program: No such file or directory, firefox&#x27;.
 Thanks to a helpful answer on StackExchange I&#x27;ve got both my shell and eshell aliases set up so that I can simply run firefox at the prompt, as an alias for flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox
 I guess the answer to my question probably likes somewhere in modifying the variables browse-url-firefox-program , or browse-url-generic-programme ?

 How much support for older versions of Emacs should I provide? Is it unreasonable to require version 27 or newer of Emacs for this simple mode?

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 through work, I have discovered TimeTimers some years ago. I have found it easy to work with, which is why I&#x27;ve bought one for myself. However, I&#x27;ve been meaning to have something like this in emacs, because I&#x27;ve noticed that no matter the package (be it built-in or tmr), I am missing the convenience that a TimeTimer provides.
 First off, I&#x27;d like to know if any of you know a package that does this or something like this: conveniently display (in the modeline, maybe?) a bar or clock that shows the passage of time in a continuous fashion, i.e. showing a graphic representation (like a bar going from full to empty or a pie chart going from full to empty) instead of changing numbers (the customary form of representing a timer in my experience).
 If that&#x27;s not a thing -- and I&#x27;d be flabbergasted about that to be frank --, I&#x27;d love to get some tips on how to implement this. If I were to choose, I&#x27;d preferably have a timetimer implemented as a decreasing progress bar in the mode line. The width would be depending upon the &quot;available space&quot; (dunno if there is a way to find that out for different configurations of modelines), the progress bar would be recalculated in regular intervals and the (pseudo-)continuous steps would be calculated depending on the time input when setting the timer. Maybe, the progress bar could &quot;blink&quot; (i.e. disappear and reappear) an amount of times to be set by a variable. For graphical representation, I am eyeing the SVG-LIB by Nicolas Rougier.
 I am grateful for tips and pointers, I am a bit at a loss as to where to start.
 Have a good day!

                              <span>Often times I find doing various commands in org-mode adds/removes whitespace around headings. This can lead to inconsistent whitespace throughout the file. Kind of annoying.
 Are there any tools to manage this? Like an auto formatter or something?

                              <span>Hi everyone! Last week I released version 0.4 of ekg, which is an extensible tag-based, sqlite-backed note taking application for emacs.
 This version has been in the works for months, and has notable improvements:
 Drafts! You can now save (with C-x C-s) long notes and they will be tagged with &quot;draft&quot; and not show in other places until you commit the note.
 Magic tags! You can now have tags that automatically execute some elisp, useful for special notes that need some different editing. The standard example is setting your input method for notes with a tag indicating it&#x27;s in a different language.
 LLM integration! Now you can have LLMs response to your notes inline, with prompts configured based on your tags. We use the new GNU ELPA llm package, so we support whatever it supports (right now Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex&#x27;s APIs)
 File notes! Just like you can have notes on URLS, can you now have notes on files! It&#x27;s basically a way to annotate any file. And because of how our prompt, template, and prefixing rules work, the directory structure can control the templates and prompts for any LLM integration you have.
 Also, here&#x27;s a video demonstrating these features!
 Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, notably Jay Rajput, Umar Ahmad and Qingshui Zheng!

Is anyone else experiencing Marked 2&#x27;s Streaming preview feature crashing with use of the Archive? I&#x27;ve recently updated to the new OS and this is the only change I can think of that could be the cause of the error. Marked 2 still works if I go to zettle and open manually.
Anyone else having this issue?</span>

It&#x27;s more an idea-of-an-idea right now, but I wanted to share early to get feedback before making it more concrete.
 Haskell Camp will be a time-bound, online event where people who wish to learn Haskell (&quot;Learners&quot;) get connected with people who wish to help people learn Haskell (&quot;Helpers&quot;).
  
You can sign up either as a Helper or a Learner.
 Learners will be grouped and paired with a Helper.
 Each Helper will have a guided exercise meant to get a beginner&#x27;s feet wet in Haskell. 
 Think of it like a &quot;craft&quot; you&#x27;d do at camp as a kid. They have guided structure around the technical parts, but still allow for the pers…</span>

                              <span>So the problem is to find the length of the longest run of spaces in a string. Just out of curiousity, I wanted to know if there is a way to use optics to solve it. Now, I know that I could write a function like this: runs :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]] that finds all the runs of elements, based on a predicate and make a traversal out of it, but if I already had a function like this, there would be no point in doing that. So, my question is: is there a way to use just optics to succinctly solve this problem?

                              <span>Let the following be functors
 newtype F x &#x3D; F x instance Functor F where fmap f (F x) &#x3D; F $ f x newtype G x &#x3D; G x instance Functor G where fmap f (G x) &#x3D; G $ f x 
 Then the following is a Natural transformation
 eta :: F a -&gt; G a eta (F a) &#x3D; G a 
 Which can be seen (though not proved, as it would require singletons) by providing the definition for the legs of the natural transformation.
 etaLeg1 :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F a -&gt; G b etaLeg1 f &#x3D; eta . fmap f etaLeg2 :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F a -&gt; G b etaLeg2 f &#x3D; fmap f . eta 
 Now, let the following be functors (The following does not type check. Or I don&#x27;t know how to make it type check.)
 newtype Monoid x &#x3D;&gt; F&#x27; x &#x3D; F&#x27; x instance Functor F&#x27; where fmap f (F&#x27; x) &#x3D; F&#x27; $ f x newtype Monoid x &#x3D;&gt; G&#x27; x &#x3D; G&#x27; x instance Functor G&#x27; where fmap f (G&#x27; x) &#x3D; G&#x27; $ f x 
 In both instances, f is a monoid homomorphism. The above can be seen to make sense by defining the following, which are basically restricted fmap&#x27;s:
 fmapF&#x27; :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; F&#x27; b fmapF&#x27; f (F&#x27; x) &#x3D; F&#x27; $ f x fmapG&#x27; :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; G&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b fmapG&#x27; f (G&#x27; x) &#x3D; G&#x27; $ f x 
 Would, then, the following be a &quot;Restricted&quot; Natural Transformation?
 phi :: Monoid a &#x3D;&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; a phi (F&#x27; a) &#x3D; G&#x27; a phiLeg1 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b phiLeg1 f &#x3D; phi . fmapF&#x27; f phiLeg2 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b phiLeg2 f &#x3D; fmapG&#x27; f . phi 
 It seems to be obvious that phi is a natural transformation, but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that something could be wrong.

                              <span>A variation of this question have been asked before, unfortunately, I am not bright enough to understand them. So I am asking this question to hopefully get a more concrete answer from a particularly generous haskeller.
 When I researched the type of IO in haskell, I get this from ghci info:
 (GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld -&gt; (# GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld, a #))
 I am not quite sure what any of this means, but from what I gather, this abstracts to something like this: IO _ :&#x3D; (RealWorld -&gt; (RealWorld, _ )). This looks like the state monad, which has type: [W, W × _ ], for a choice of state handling type W. The StateT monad I see in documentation is a little different since it has monad composition StateT (s -&gt; m (a, s)), so I guess I should say that we require the monad m to be the idenitity monad. 
 My question is, why do we need to use these primitive types? Somehow, this makes it possible for IO functions to interact with the outside environment, like call other programs or writing to the file system. But how does that happen exactly? 
 Second, what is this RealWorld? Is it a bitestring? An integer? A constant? When updating the state, what actually happens? 
 Lastly, the ST monad, which has definition: ST s a. This type allows us to perform mutations to inside variables but it does not allow effects. From what I gather, this does in fact mutate memory. It also has a function to &quot;escape&quot; the ST wrapper, called runST. Obviously, this makes practical sense, but what is stopping up from simply writing a function runIO that escapes the IO. That would most certainly be a bug, but what is preventing us from doing it?

 I heard the Haskell online community was supportive so I decided to look for some help.
 For context: I have never touched Haskell or Prolong
 I just started a Haskell class last week and this is insanely difficult (for me). I don&#x27;t understand the Syntax of this language. Worst part is my exam is all code and i have 9 weeks to prepare :(
 Any good resources?

 As the VSCode Haskel extention now requires HLS 2.3.0.0, I updated it together with cabal and stack (both upgraded to the recommended version). Ever since though, the extention is not working. 
 I’ve nuked ghcup and reinstalled the extension to try to solve the issue, but it did not work.

 Any suggestions on what to do?

It seems like it &quot;solves&quot; many issues or annoying things from Haskell. I wanted to know the opinion of Idris in comparison with Haskell. Is there something Haskell can do better from a type-system perspective? If Idris had the same community size as Haskell and the same maturity, would you choose Idris instead?

 VSCode doesn&#x27;t recognize implicit returns so you have to unindent manually when you move to the beginning of the next line if youre starting a new function and indent manually when you start a function. Scalafmt doesn&#x27;t recognize bad indentation either.
 Intellij Idea object MyProgram: def abs(n: Int): Int &#x3D; if n &lt; 0 then -n else n private def formatAbs(x: Int) &#x3D; &lt;-- val msg &#x3D; &quot;The absolute value of %d is %d&quot; &lt;-- Metals doesn&#x27;t indent msg.format(x, abs(x)) &lt;--Metals doesn&#x27;t indent @ main def hello: Unit &#x3D; println(formatAbs(-42)) 
 I tried Idea and their support is even worse it wouldn&#x27;t even let me unindent the private which defaulted to the indentation level of the &#x60;else&#x60; statement in the abs function. 
 How can I get VSCode to behave correctly? I don&#x27;t really want to manually adjust indentation on every line every time that just seems tedious.
 Edit: from my research I can just use curly braces after the &#x3D; in definitions and this will enforce the indentation rules. https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/other-new-features/indentation.html
 Is this safe/reasonable to do? I imagine it’s not idiomatic, but having to do this manually will drive me nuts. 
 I want to learn FP but this is really I convenient if this isn’t viable I’ll probably just opt to learn Ocaml instead.

 tree-sitter doesn&#x27;t recognize FOOPTY_API since it&#x27;s a dllexport, and I think it&#x27;s probably a windows-only construct. How would I go about making sure it parses that part properly?
 Also, the GENERATED_BODY() specifier is an Unreal-ism, and I don&#x27;t think it causes any trouble, but it would be nice if I could add it (and other Unreal specific identifiers) to a list for specific highlighting and/or indentation instructions. 
 Where&#x27;s a good place to start with these sort of small-scale tweaks? I&#x27;ve seen some links to posts with titles like, &quot;Let&#x27;s write a major mode&quot; but I&#x27;m really just trying to tweak the existing C++ mode to handle a couple weirdo special cases. (Though I think maybe the dllexport thing MIGHT be big enough that it should be included, so maybe I should file a bug?)

                              <span>Lots of people use python interactively through M-x run-python and send code to it with things like C-c C-c and C-c C-r. That&#x27;s fair enough, but it has it&#x27;s problems. When an imported library changes the only sensible way to deal with it is to stop the python process and start another one. (That&#x27;s because in Python the built in &quot;import&quot; statement doesn&#x27;t reload the file. You could reload each library with reload, but that would be tricky.)
 For that reason, I would like to use M-x compile. It&#x27;s suitable for that kind of thing and I&#x27;ve used it for running programs written in other languages. (I think this is a fairly well known Emacs trick).
 The problem is Venvs. My projects use venv. If I just start a fresh python using M-x compile then it won&#x27;t be in the right venv. I&#x27;ve thought about writing a batch file to solve this problem. I expect though, someone has already written a package to solve this?
 Is there such a package?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying for the past three days to get elfeed to display desktop notifications. It was suggested that elfeed-new-entry-hook can be used and it works, but parsing it is a painful trial and error.
 I&#x27;ve added https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed?unit&#x3D;second&amp;interval&#x3D;10 feed to be able to test it.
 This works for example:
 (add-hook &#x27;elfeed-new-entry-hook (lambda (entry) (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) &quot; -_ &quot; (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity &#x27;high ))) 
 But changing elfeed-entry-title (on the 5th line) to elfeed-entry-tags or &#x60;elfeed-entry-feed makes it fail (no notifications appear anymore).
 Does anyone have any idea why?
 UPDATE: Solved it (defun created for debugging):
 (defun elfeed-desktop-notifications (entry) &quot;Parse and display new feeds as desktop notifications.&quot; (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-feed-title (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-feed entry))) &quot;\n&quot; (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity &#x27;high )) (add-hook &#x27;elfeed-new-entry-hook #&#x27;elfeed-desktop-notifications)

                              <span>Hello guys,I sometimes use the windows version of emacs at work, and one neat feature of windows is Super (windows key) + V, which is like the traditional copy/paste except that it lets you browse your clipboard history before pasting.
 The menu does pop up but selecting an entry does nothing.
 I use it quite often for other programs, but emacs ignores it (vanilla emacs 29.1, launched without init.el (-Q option).
 Have you succeeded in making it work ? In general, I am curious as to how the sync between clipboard and kill-ring is done.

                              <span>Hello all. I&#x27;ve recently made another video about my 3D game engine project Game :: Dangerous (written in Haskell), which can be found as follows.
 Project repos: https://github.com/Mushy-pea
 Video: https://youtu.be/wOSQ1cYoZXM?si&#x3D;bF2UtM_zr8OYOPHi
 I&#x27;m interested in what people think about some of the design choices I&#x27;ve made. One of the most interesting things to me about software development is how design and implementation interact. So briefly, the engine is not a development framework such as Unity or Unreal (nor anywhere near that complex) but more similar to GZDoom for example. It&#x27;s a program that loads a text file, within which is encoded environment geometry, game logic scripting and references to asset files. The game logic scripting is implemented through a virtual machine in the engine that runs a bytecode form of the engine&#x27;s custom scripting language.
 I spent a long time deciding how to implement a map editor, when I probably should have decided early on and developed it in parallel. What I eventually decided to do (in June 2022) was to write a local web server that loaded the same map files as the engine, allowed their state to be queried and modified through API requests from a client and could save that state back to the same text file format. That server now makes up about 20% of the Haskell code in the main repo and shares some static libraries with the engine. I&#x27;ve also started writing the web client that provides a UI for the map editor, a prototype of which is shown in the video.
 Anyway, thanks for reading and looking forward to feedback if anyone feels like it.

                              <span>I want to make my code look consistent and neat. I don’t have any personal stylistic preferences at the moment – I want to pick a widely accepted style and stick with it. I’m used to tools like Rust’s rustfmt, which have a well-defined style with good defaults.
 What formatters does Haskell have that are similar to them? ormolu and fourmolu look like good options with sensible defaults.

 ​
 However I was curious if you guys have some more experience with libraries that are more suited for game development? Not necessarily engines (tho with would be nice if Haskell has them), but something that can handle more complex cases.

                              <span>This is a general question, though it comes up because I&#x27;ve started using Emacs 29 and tree-sitter.
 There are 4 presets listed for tree-sitter, with a few more for the standard C(++) modes:
  
Gnu
 BSD
 Linux
 K&amp;R
  
Where in any of the emacs documentation are these indentation styles explained? I eventually found them on wikipedia, but that&#x27;s frankly a terrible cop-out on the documentation side. The manual helpfully gives shrug-emoji style descriptions like this, for the BSD style: &quot;Also known as “Allman style” after Eric Allman.&quot; 
 Moreover, I&#x27;d like to know what exactly emacs (or tree-sitter) thinks these styles mean. Just because there&#x27;s a definition on wikipedia doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what&#x27;s being adhered to.
 But even better is if I could just use the clang-format style in real time, rather than waiting for it to clean up after me. Is there anything that already does that?

 then the \coloneq command is prettified. How can I achieve what I want?

 Feedback welcome.
 Looking for a few brave souls to give it a try. Love to find bugs and functional improvements that my dogfooding hasn&#x27;t uncovered.
 Thanks!

The icons used in the breadcrumbs and treemacs were really blurry so I installed treemacs nerd icons and now treemacs has icons that are much cleaner but lsp breadcrumbs still has the blurry icons. 
 Anyone know how to get a crisper icon in lsp mode breadcrumbs?

 If I run sage-shell:run-sage to get a SageMath shell in Emacs, and run help(), I get the standard help message, which starts with &quot;Welcome to Sage 10.1!&quot;.
 But if I try help(diff) or any other specific function, Emacs hangs. Doing C-g allows me to use Emacs again, but the SageMath session is no longer responsive: trying to enter any other command results in hanging. Even C-c C-d no longer works, I have to try C-c C-\ and wait for the SageMath kernel to crash, or do M-x kill-process.
 This all seemed to work before I upgraded Emacs and changed my package manager to straight.el.
 I&#x27;m on Emacs 29.1, using sage-shell-mode v0.3.
 I&#x27;ve covnfigured it as follows:
 (use-package sage-shell-mode :straight t :defer t :custom (sage-shell:sage-executable (executable-find &quot;sage&quot;)) (sage-shell:set-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:check-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit nil) (sage-shell:use-simple-prompt nil) ) 
 (However, I find that the custom settings aren&#x27;t being respected either ...)
 I also use ob-sagemath, which allows me to use SageMath in org-src-blocks, which works fine as far as I can tell.

                              <span>I am using EWW to read articles and I want to capture notes into an exisiting file not part of capture templates. The overall workflow is as follows. Lets say I want to catch up on the GPT agents of generative AI and prompt engineering. I google the topic in EWW and just read with a org file open on the side buffer. I want to take notes and capture quotes into a that org file. when I select text from EWW, and intiate capture I want to insert text into the org file on the side where the point (cursor) is or even at the end of the file. How can I configure org-capture for this?
 EDIT:
 Think of it like this. I want to have a org file each reading session and I have have multiple reading sessions in parallel (session don&#x27;t mean single chunk of time). How can i configure org-capture so that I can create a new org file for each reading session. or org-capture is not the right tool for this? Some other workflow?

                              <span>Hello Emacs users, I&#x27;m currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that&#x27;s going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.
 I&#x27;m trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven&#x27;t figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. 
 I&#x27;ve already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. 
 Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won&#x27;t come out as clean as I think. 
 Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the  key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don&#x27;t align properly, but I suspect that&#x27;s another issue maybe fixed by puni.
 ​
 The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I&#x27;ve heard mixed opinions on that, some say it&#x27;s great, some say it&#x27;s terrible, I don&#x27;t really know. Without electric-indent I don&#x27;t have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. 
 (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code &gt;:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) 
 If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful. Thanks for your time in advance. :)

                              <span>Hi!
 I just stumbled upon a difference between the Scala 2 and Scala 3 compilers that originated in at least one bug in the form of NullPointerExceptions, that we didn&#x27;t have to worry about before.
 It&#x27;s super simple to reproduce, given a REPL:Scala 3.3.1
 scala&gt; val test: String &#x3D; test val test: String &#x3D; null 
 Scala 2.13.11
 scala&gt; val test: String &#x3D; test ^ warning: value test does nothing other than call itself recursively val test: String &#x3D; null 
 That warning is the difference between knowing that you are doing something weird or not. Although I&#x27;m not sure why this is even a warning and not an error, when would you ever want to initialize a variable by assigning to itself?Is this something that should be fixed in the Scala 3 compiler? 
 EDIT: this is already a known issue https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14429

                              <span>Dotty-cps-async 0.9.19 ( https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async ) is on Maven Central.
 New in this release:
  
Optional loom support for JDK-21. With the help of Loom, we can transform arguments of high-order functions without requiring a shifted variant of this function to be available.
  
​
 def topScored[A](c:Iterable[A], n: Int)(score: A&#x3D;&gt;Double) &#x3D; c.map(a&#x3D;&gt;(a,score(a)).sortBy(- _._2).take(n) ... val top100 &#x3D; topScore(c,100)(a &#x3D;&gt; await(fetchScore(a.id)) 
 Note that this also works for effect monads.
  
Direct context encoding: it&#x27;s still under experimental annotation but much closer to full functionality. Now we can call a direct-encoded function over G[_] in the context of F[_] if the inclusion of G in F. This can be a foundation for the natural encoding of monadic effect stacks:
 type IOResource &#x3D; [X]&#x3D;&gt;&gt;Resource[IO,X]
 def open(name: Path, options: OpenOption*)(using CpsDirect[IOResource]): AsynchronousFileChannel &#x3D;
 .....
 def read(input: AsynchronousFileChannel, bufSize: Int)(using CpsDirect[IO]): ByteBuffer &#x3D;
 ....
 //Then later inside asyncScope[IO]:
 val channel &#x3D; open(name, READ)
 val data &#x3D; read(input, BUF_SIZE) 
 ....
 
A few bug fixes.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I just published a new scala blog, especially for total beginners to the language. I explained about the usage of Scala-CLI, Scala Toolkit and Scastie to make the Scala learning easier for beginners. 
 With this, I am hoping that some of you who are starting out with the Scala journey might find it useful.

                              <span>As far as I understand function with class constraints are transformed into a function with an extra parameter being the typeclass dictionary. This allows the function to not have to be specialized and only decide at runtime what to do exactly (sorry for the bad explanation). In short Show a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; String is transform internally to Dict a -&gt; a -&gt; String.
 I have a discussion on discourse where people consider this extra parameter as part of the function: Show a -&gt; a -&gt; String has TWO parameters.
 My intuition is that this extra parameter is only the result of an implementtaion choice. An hypotetical compiler could work back from the main an instantiate all functions with required types. Therefore passing a class dictionaly might be needed for practical reason but not in theory.
 Am I right or is dictionary passin the only way to implement typeclass in Haskell ?

                              <span>Hi, Gnu Emacs noob here. I&#x27;m having trouble debugging AUCTeX. When I run TeX-command-run-all with C-c C-a Biber is not run for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, and I must run it manually with C-c C-c Biber RET to have my citations properly compiled. 
 Does anyone know how I can forse C-c C-a to run Biber as well as the other commands? 
 My config is pretty vanilla and for AUCTeX is as follows: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; Auctex (require &#x27;package) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;auctex) (package-install &#x27;auctex))
 (require &#x27;tex)
 (push (list &#x27;output-pdf &quot;Skim&quot;) TeX-view-program-selection) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 29.1 downloaded from MacPorts on a MacBook Air m1.
 thanks!

                              <span>The files have a relatively uncomplicated syntax. Plain statements ending with a semicolon, and blocks delimited by curly braces (see for example https://github.com/jtkristoff/junos/blob/master/firewall.conf).
 I tried the junos-mode but it behaved rather weirdly.
 Is there a programming language mode that will be suitable for this format?
 If not, is there a mode which can do the following, or something close to these?
  
Backspace at whitespace indents properly with previous block
 Ability to collapse and expand blocks depending on indent level or matching brace
 spell check using words already used in the buffer
  
Will appreciate your help!

 I want to be able to expand/collapse my functions such like in the picture below.

 These 3 dots; I want to be able to click them to open/close the code. I searched quite a bit and found nothing about having them open/close with mouse. If they can be opened/closed with keyboard as well even better, but mainly I want to with mouse.
 The language I use is python.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I was wandering what do you guys use to program -let’s say a package- and test it as you go? So far I’ve been coding in the scratch buffer and executing blocks, but that seems really inefficient, I’m sure there is another way, more so in the case of writing long packages. 
 I’m used to coding in Python in emacs using the repl which includes a python interactive console, but I cannot find the equivalent for emacs lisp.
 I would be grateful if you could point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>I am editing an i3 file and it opens up with conf-mode. Indent-region remove all indentations from the region. The syntax is the following:
 conf { content } 
 I am aware that I need to setup indent-line-function to make this work, but I don&#x27;t know enough Elisp to write a function to parse the file and make the proper indentation. A hack I thought of is use to use another&#x27;s mode indent function like nginx&#x27;s nginx-indent-line. I could also copy the function and use it by itself, not requiring to load the mode, but I don&#x27;t know if this is the most appropriate way to handle this problem.
 EDIT: I already use Alexander-Miller/i3wm-Config-Mode which only improves the syntax highlighting.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 4 months now, and seriously, and I don&#x27;t want to go back to VSCode because of the fact that I can do everything in it (notes, task management, and programming; I also love org-mode). Unfortunately, my development experience has been okay-ish with Emacs. I have installed lsp along with corfu for completions (and web-mode for ReactJS) but the completions are not as good as VSCode. They are quite slow too. Here&#x27;s the link to my config file. How can I improve the completions? I would also like it to highlight unused imports (flycheck isn&#x27;t doing it, idk why). Just this much would suffice :) I don&#x27;t need anything else from a code-editor (although Emacs is so much more than that).

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m new to emacs and so far it&#x27;s really easy to use and it&#x27;s very effective. One annoying thing however is that every time I edit the code I&#x27;m writing, I have to quit() in the interpreter, close the window (Ctrl-x + 0), restart the interpreter (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) and reimport the code.
 I edit the code and then just write &quot;import *script*&quot; but the changes don&#x27;t appear unless I do it as mentioned above.
 Even if I just quit(), I can&#x27;t just (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) again because I have to close the buffer for it to start again.
 Is it supposed to be like this? Or am I doing something wrong?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello!
 (short to-the-point question under)
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs, ubuntu and all those stuff; I&#x27;m studying computer science, I&#x27;m a first year and we&#x27;re using Linux and (I&#x27;m using) emacs. On the school computers we have to input given commands in the Linux console to get access to the &quot;import cv2&quot;, but I do most of my work home and I have a windows.
 I was then wondering how I can download (?) and make it so I can import &quot;cv2&quot; and use it&#x27;s commands like &quot;cv2.imread(&#x27;plane.jpg&#x27;)&quot; and so on. I&#x27;ve searched on google but found nothing useful.
 I&#x27;m kind of just starting out so I don&#x27;t understand what it means to &quot;mix&quot;/&quot;import&quot; OpenCV into emacs and such things. I have downloaded OpenCV (I think) but I couldn&#x27;t just start emacs and start using the functions from &quot;import cv2&quot;.
 ​
 Short question: How can I use the &quot;import cv2&quot; on emacs and start working with pictures? As beginner friendly as possible.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Now that the future of vim is uncertain, I am looking at emacs as I see the project is quite active and there&#x27;s still a very healthy ecosystem of plugin development. I am not interested in neovim as they have removed a critical feature to my work (cscope) and I feel that they do not value the kind of stability and support for working with older tools and languages that I need.
 I mainly work on real time kernels for embedded systems, boot loaders, etc. written in C. I also frequently write in Make, Bash, Rust, Python, and Go. I use a very minimal set of Vim plugins, primarily ALE for linting and LSP support and fzf for finding files, symbols (with ripgrep) etc. Frequently, LSPs are not a perfect fit for my work because of the large index size and the need to switch between different workin…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m on emacs 29 and use treesit. Code in typescript most of the time.
 Wondering if there&#x27;s module that highlights the current syntax tree branch (or de-emphasizes the rest) in the editor like this:
  
function 
 statement 1
 statement 2
 branch 
 sub branch
 some code
 sub branch 2
 
 
  
I imagine such feature would be very useful for multiple if-else, case(s), and other nested code with lots of leafs

 Changes since v2.11.1:
 Release notes:
  
Further to the release notes for Stack 2.3.1, the -static suffix has been removed from the statically linked Linux/x86_64 binaries.
 The binaries for Linux/Aarch64 are now statically linked.
 Binaries are now provided for macOS/AArch64.
  
Changes since v2.11.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
Build artefacts are placed in .stack-work/dist/
/ (hashed to a shorter path on Windows), rather than.stack-work/dist/
/. This allows build artifacts to be distinguished by GHC version.
 By default, the stack build progress bar is capped to a length equal to the terminal width.
 When building GHC from source, Stack no longer uses Hadrian&#x27;s deprecated -…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to org-mode but think it&#x27;s the best tool for task and project management I&#x27;ve ever used.
 But there are reasons why I would like to stick to markdown for my general note-taking.
 So I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to: 1. Make org-mode recognise.md files (I know this is YES). 2. Make org-mode pick-up TODO states from org-mode headings appearing in .md files with otherwise md syntax (*** TODO Read this, somewhere in md file) and show it in agenda. 3. Or even make org-mode recognise some md elements (headings or Obsidian-style checkboxes) with TODO states.
 I know 1 is possible, though not sure who uses this for what. I think 2 might be possible? And would probably be exactly what I need. Option 3 smells like somethink no-one should ever attempt, yet I&#x27;m not sure why (not).
 Thanks!!

                              <span>I have a trait and several case classes that extend the trait.
 each case class shares the definition for &quot;update&quot; methods that use the copy function that they get from being case classes. Since the methods are all the same I want to declare them once in the trait definition but can&#x27;t because it would require using copy() which is automatically generated for case classes. 
 I&#x27;m new to Scala but this seems like an issue that would come up often unless I am not writing in the best Scala style or it&#x27;s not that big of an inconvenience.
 are case classes syntactic sugar for normal classes that inherit or extend a special class or trait that I exploit?

                              <span>I would appreciate your thoughts on how to improve the data type modelling for my app. This gonna be a relatively long post. If you don’t find it appropriate to be posted here, please let me know.
 My goal is to follow u/lexi-lambda’s principle of &quot;Parse, don’t validate&quot; as close as possible, but I have the feeling of failing big in this regard.
 I am currently working on a GTK4 app that loads a yaml file and creates form widgets for the entries in this file. It might look like this
 inputForms: - &#x27;#key&#x27;: text &#x27;#type&#x27;: textarea &#x27;#title&#x27;: Text &#x27;#multiple&#x27;: -1 # we can have infinitely many of them. &#x27;#value&#x27;: - &#x27;Some input text.&#x27; # we saved two - &#x27;Some more&#x27; # and will create to widgets when loading - &#x27;#key&#x27;: person &#x27;#type&#x27;: name &#x27;#title&#x27;: Person &#x27;#multiple&#x27;: 6 # we can have 6 of them. - &#x27;#ke…</span>

 Also I&#x27;ve noticed that emacs users... kind of don&#x27;t use notifications (org-agenda, elfeed)? Do you all guys just have photographic memory, see the future, read minds to not need to keep up with any schedule?

                              <span>I started using emacs this week and have been interested in using org. I went for a modular config and attached my very simple org module below.
 From what I&#x27;ve read so far there isn&#x27;t necessarily a &quot;correct&quot; way to configure emacs but I&#x27;m asking for a critique on anything in this module. Whether that be my use of use-package (especially as I&#x27;ve found its documentation somewhat unclear), my custom function, code style, or anything. I would appreciate any two cents or bits of wisdom as I begin my journey configuring emacs.

                              <span>There is a really niche, but simple package for elfeed that adds system notifications: https://github.com/flocks/elfeed-notifier/blob/master/elfeed-notifier.el
 However loading it by default with straight package manager doesn&#x27;t work:
 (package! elfeed-notifier :recipe (:host github :repo &quot;flocks/elfeed-notifier&quot;)) 
 Nothing happens, no function or variables are available.
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s the standard procedure for loading such packages? I assume that it has something to do with use-package?

                              <span>through little bit of research i have found a way to make Emacs faster with lsp and eglot none of this are my code i just found it from browsing on reddit
 (fset #&#x27;jsonrpc--log-event #&#x27;ignore) remove laggy typing it probably reduces chatty json from lsp to eglot i guess
 (setq eglot-events-buffer-size 0) disabling event logging in eglot
 (setq eglot-sync-connect nil) disabling elgot freeze the UI for up to 3s when you open file maybe large one
 install gcmh package to increase the gc value when necessary and decrease it. nice package btw
 (add-hook &#x27;focus-out-hook &#x27;garbage-collect) optional, if you don&#x27;t want to use gcmh package
 (setq eglot-connect-timeout nil) optional &quot;my code actually&quot;
 set this values on company package or
 (setq company-idle-delay 0) how long to wait for company mode to wait after it got completion obviously you don&#x27;t want to wait so just set it to 0
 (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1) how many characters you want to type before popping up the completion UI obviously 1 right
 if there is anything that i am missing pls let me know guys, am new to Emacs i want to learn from you all. i would love to see your config too to learn how to configure mine too

                              <span>I&#x27;m running emacs off the master branch, compiling with the following flags:
 ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-modules --with-cairo --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;no
 When I open a PDF and enable pdf-tools with pdf-tools-install the performance is initially great. However, after I resize with +,- the performance dramatically drops, scrolling becomes extremely laggy to the point of being unusable. Resetting the buffer restores the performance. Running the profiler didn&#x27;t illuminate anything useful.
 I&#x27;ve eliminated there being something in my configuration since the issue persists even when I run emacs with the -Q flag. Of note for my system I&#x27;m running on wayland. I&#x27;ll post an update when I&#x27;m able to test on Xorg.
 Are there some packages that I might be missing on my system? Or some configuration options I might be missing?
 Thanks a million for the help!
 update issue appears on the same machine running xorg.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have an orgmode file to host all my personal notes.
 I want to archive all DONE taks in the same file.
 For now I have an header called Archived and I move the done tasks to there but I wanted to make this semi automatic (lets say I execute a command and that is moved to that header).
 Is there a way to do this?

 Bellow is my orgmode config

                              <span>Based on my understanding, compile it without sudo might be a safer option. I recall that when I used the sudo installation of Emacs, the old binaries remained even after I removed Emacs with sudo make uninstall, make clean and make distclean.
 This is the way I compile Emacs right now: (Notice, I&#x27;m using sudo make install)
 $ ./autogen.sh $ ./configure --without-compress-install --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-mailutils --with-tree-sitter CC&#x3D;gcc-12 $ make -j 4 $ sudo make install 
 If I were able to compile it in the home folder, I believe it would be safer in the sense that it wouldn&#x27;t interfere with any system libraries, right? And it would be easier to uninstall, correct?

                              <span>I do run emacs (most of the time 29) on a headless Debian 12 using Windows command prompt with SSH client and tmux on the server side.
 The emacs conf do use doom-modeline and all-the-icons. Of course this do not work correct. And I understand why.

 Is there a way to work around that? Does doom-modeline has a config switch to use something different than all-the-icons?

                              <span>I often grab let-alist for this which results in this code:
 (let-alist json-alist (let-alist (aref .choices 0) .message.content)) 
 Now, I wondered if there is something like https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/get-in (example: (get-in json-alist [&quot;choices&quot; 0 &quot;message&quot; &quot;content&quot;])) which reads a lot nicer? It&#x27;s mostly about mixing vectors and alists.
 I tried -let but I couldn&#x27;t make it work in a single statement.
 Thanks :)

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m thinking about:
My life is slowly imploding.
How I can be compassionate to myself. Let the breath coddle, hug, nurture, and fill me with wonder.
The tutoring possibilities of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT.
Blogging my notes.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
The 28-hour Jazz for Study Spotify playlist

                              <span>Hi folks, 
 When I use the mouse to close a tab on the tab-line, all works as expected. The context menu choice &quot;Close&quot; removes the tab from the tab-line and buries the buffer. 
 However, when I call tab-line-close-tab() with M-x, or from a keybinding, or by evaluating it in *scratch*, this error is returned: (args-out-of-range 0 0). 
 Here&#x27;s the relevant part of the backtrace:

The Elisp for tab-line-close-tab() shows that it takes an optional argument, EVENT. I&#x27;m wondering this: if I provided an argument to EVENT, an argument to indicate something other than a mouse click, would the function then work?

                              <span>(I&#x27;m starting to realize and accept that certain agree I am handicapped and I&#x27;m really losing the ability to type consistently with my right hand. I&#x27;m also finding Voice control and dictation software to be severely lacking. But I do feel like with the right Emacs set up I should be able to do more with less)
 Has anyone had success using emacs to help deal with their RSI? On a basic level I&#x27;m thinking of things like auto capitalizing sentences after. Or some kind of English friendly hippie expand to auto complete words using context. In the dream version maybe you can occasionally dictate words and then feed that through Local LLM to fix up the inevitable problems. Also, personally, something like a super abbreviation module that was great at auto completing words or guessing it words only using the left side of a split keyboard.
 The ultimate irony here is I&#x27;d love to take on some of these projects myself, but I can&#x27;t effectively type anymore. Sad panda. After a few days of rest I&#x27;m able to test new keyboard, I got excited for a few hours, and then spend the rest of the day watching the pain in my right forearm intensify. I&#x27;m hoping to get up to some base level of functionality using existing tools that I can use the bootstrap my own development.
 Anyway, if there&#x27;s anything you know of or directions you can put me in I greatly appreciate it.
 (if my current depression is coming through this post please excuse me, chronic pain is just a bitch and AA so when you can&#x27;t do any of the things that you would normally do to take your mind off it. I guess I should be happy voice control works on this iPad at all, I just wish it was better and hooked up to a local LLM. Peace)

                              <span>So I was using Emacs 25 on Windows 10 and I had a macro saved in my .emacs. The macro basically executed &quot;run-python&quot; and then maximised the buffer in which the python shell opens. It worked fine on Emacs 25, but after I updated to version 29.1.2, I am getting the following error message 
 kmacro-exec-ring-item: Invalid function: ([134217848 114 117 110 45 112 121 116 104 111 ...] 0 &quot;%d&quot;) 
 The code of the macro is as follows: 
 ;; A macro to execute run-python, switch window to it, then maximize the window (fset &#x27;shortcut-run-python-maximize (lambda (&amp;optional arg) &quot;Keyboard macro.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote ([134217848 114 117 110 45 112 121 116 104 111 110 return 24 111 24 49] 0 &quot;%d&quot;)) arg))) ;; Macro code to run python ends here ;; Bind shortcut-run-python-maximize to the following key sequence (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c r p&quot;) &#x27;shortcut-run-python-maximize) ;; Bind shortcut-run-python-maximize code ends here

                              <span>I know I can use a shell src block to run linux commands and shell scripts, but I&#x27;d like to try and figure out something more like the the org-AI block package that is able to generate a prompt. I am wondering if there is a way to basically make a block generate a shell prompt (just a $ would be enough) where I can input a command, run it w/ C-c C-c and have the output appear inside the block, below it w/out a prompt, or maybe just writing a command to run a shell command at the point if it is in one of these blocks. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I would like to use either space or RET to follow hyperlinks in org-mode documents and in the Emacs documentation. How might I configure that? I&#x27;ve read this fine post but as an Evil user it does not help!
 And in any case, what is the built-in Evil keypress to follow links in documentation? C-c C-o does work in org-mode, but it does not work in Emacs documentation.
 Thank you!

But when org-src-preserve-indentation is set to t (to solve some indentation issues) the results are not exported anymore (but the code blocks are). Any idea why?

                              <span>Hi ... absolute emacs fan here (using emacs solely to write prose) and now that I updated to 29 (macOS) I encounter a strange problem in org-mode: return doesn&#x27;t work at the end of an org-headline when folded, it&#x27;s just stuck. Normally placing point behind ellipsis and then hitting return would just place point at the beginning of the line below the headline (while it stays collapsed).
 Now point is stuck behind the ellipsis! Why?!
 Removed my complete config to test emacs out of the box and the problem ist still there and googled around but could not find anything about this problem.
 Is this a bug or something new that I don&#x27;t understand?
 Would be very thankful if somebody could tell me something about this.
 Thanks for reading.
 Many greetz
 Arthur

Charting a course toward a stable API for GHC by Alexis King
Our plan of attack is to start small. We cannot hope to address all the complex needs of, say, typechecker plugins or HLS right out of the gate, but we believe we can provide real, immediate utility to many existing tools.
Defeating Return Type Polymorphism by Philipp Hagenlocher
This post is an exploration of a generic technique to effectively circumvent return type polymorphism in Haskell programs using GADTs and existential quantification.

 Stan is a static analysis tool for Haskell. Its maintainers seem to have stopped supporting it after the GHC 8.x series because the GHC API changed too frequently for them to want to keep making adjustments.
 Last year I did quite a lot of work to bring Stan and its dependencies up to 9.4. I made a PR to the Stan Github repo last month:
 https://github.com/kowainik/stan/pull/506
 I haven’t heard anything from the maintainers.
 The only maintainer I know of is Veronika Romashkina. I’ve sent her a private email about this but had no response. Does anyone know how I can get in contact with Veronika or another Stan maintainer, if there is one?
 I would be willing to be a comaintainer for Stan and the rest of the Kowainik ecosystem (if only to make sure they continue to work with future GHCs).

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently exploring the integration of Azure services with Haskell for a production project. I&#x27;ve previously used &#x60;Amazonka&#x60;, the Haskell library for interacting with AWS services, and found it quite useful. The main services used are EC2, S3, Secrets Manager, SES (via Amazonka).
 I&#x27;m trying to port the above (working) Haskell-based backend to work in Azure.
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone has experience using Haskell to work with Azure services in a production (or test) environment. Specifically, I&#x27;m interested in hearing about:
  
Your experiences or challenges faced while integrating Azure services with Haskell
 Recommendations on Haskell libraries or tools that you found effective for interacting with Azure services, similar to how Amazonka is used for AWS.
  
Thanks in advance for your input! 😊

                              <span>Suppose I have a data type CPInfo. 
 data CPInfo &#x3D; CU ConstUtf8 | CI ConstInteger | CF ConstFloat deriving (Typeable) newtype ConstUtf8 &#x3D; ConstUtf8 String newtype ConstInteger &#x3D; ConstInteger Int newtype ConstFloat &#x3D; ConstFloat Float 
 And I can unwrap CPInfo respectively. But there are warnings: Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive. How can I get rid of these warnings.
 readConstUtf8 :: CPInfo -&gt; ConstantUtf8 readConstUtf8 cp &#x3D; let CU x &#x3D; cp in x readConstInteger :: CPInfo -&gt; ConstantInteger readConstInteger cp &#x3D; let CI x &#x3D; cp in x readConstFloat :: CPInfo -&gt; ConstantFloat readConstFloat cp &#x3D; let CF x &#x3D; cp in x 
 I can use typeOf to check the type, and there are no warnings. 
 I want to define a generic function like checkType to make readConstUtf8 as simple and pragmatic as readCU.
 checkType :: TypeRep -&gt; CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo checkType re cp &#x3D; if typeOf cp &#x3D;&#x3D; re then cp else error &quot;Unmatched type.&quot; readCU :: CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo readCU &#x3D; checkType $ typeOf CU readCI :: CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo readCI &#x3D; checkType $ typeOf CI readCF :: CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo readCF &#x3D; checkType $ typeOf CF

                              <span>I was reading the following two passages written by Martin and Mitch when I realize a seemingly simple yet complex question, how do we define a single idea/core idea in a literature note?
Let&#x27;s say I just read a passage on how to make a cake and create a number of highlights and comments. Now is the title &quot;how to make a cake&quot; a core idea? Or should I go into more detailed title like which flour should I buy or how do I use the oven? If I need to go to the detailed titles, does it mean I need to create a separate note for each title?

                              <span>As part of my ongoing quest to incorporate functionality from Excel-like programs into Org tables, I made company-org-table, a completion backend for Org table cells that mimics the auto-complete behavior of spreadsheet programs like Excel, LibreOffice, and Google Sheets: 
 https://github.com/shankar2k/company-org-table
 By default, the completion candidates are the contents of other cells in the same table column, but company-org-table can also be configured to dynamically generate candidates based on the table name and column header.
 The animation below illustrates company-org-table in action:
 Auto-completion in an Org table using company-org-table. Completion candidates in the first two columns are predefined lists, but in the second two columns are other table cells in the same column.
 I hope some of you find this useful!

                              <span>I have a java project (don&#x27;t be mean) im working on. Now, I really rely on the debugger to make sense of the janky code I wrote. Since im an advanced genius, my project uses java preview features. LSP correctly sets this up (due to it being specified in my pom.xml, I assume).
 When I try to start the debug using M-x dap-java-debug however, it wont run due to the missing --enable-preview-features flag.
 So i wrote a custom debug template that should fix this - only problem is, since I have already picked a debug template the first time I launched the debugger, I can&#x27;t figure out how to now switch to my new template. If it matters: im using doom.

                              <span>because org-capture automatically calls org-store-link, and because I have org-id-link-to-org-use-id set to t, sometimes when I do org-capture while the cursor is at the very top of an org file, for example a file like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +FILETAGS: :gtd:
  
task1 &#x60;&#x60; org would add aPROPERTIESdrawer before the#+FILETAGS: :gtd:line and add anID&#x60; property. I find this annoying because 1) I never link to files, always to headings 2) this looks ugly.
 
 Is there a way to configure org to not to do this? something like, please only create ID property for headings, not for files.

 I have a function:  superLongFunctionNameNotInSnakeCase  and I&#x27;m here:  superLo  I can complete this using M-/, but I would like to use . My question is. How can I make this happen?
 Obviously, in some contexts, tab may do other things (like adjust indentation to different levels), but in this context, is there a way to make emacs intelligently understand that I would like it to code complete?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
This theme has been discussed previously, but I&#x27;m approaching it from the perspective of knowledge work and research. What are your personal views on AI, specifically ChatGPT and related models, in relation to how we engage with knowledge and conduct research?
Recently, I had the opportunity to work with ChatGPT-4. I&#x27;ve been inputting numerous academic papers for analysis and summarization. From my perspective, this is one of its most valuable applications. I&#x27;m exploring worlds of CFS and Fibromyalgia, and as someone who isn&#x27;t currently in academia (though I have past experience), ChatGPT has empowered me to undertake my own research. I believe I can do so reliably, evaluating various sources to draw practical, science-based conclusions. It has also allowed me to simplify complex topics by explaining concepts in clear, jargon-free language.
A couple of additional questions: Are there any drawbacks to this approach? How do you engage with these models, if at all?</span>

 Without the Ord &amp; Eq bounds, I know it will be as follows:

 So, the question is, how do I add the Ord and Eq bounds to the Assoc type?

                              <span>Hi! So, part of my bachelor’s thesis is basically running a CNN over some images that can hold letters, numbers, and a couple of logic symbols. This being my first time ever handling an ML task, I wanted to go safe with pytorch.
 The thing is, I’m having a couple of type issues with the library, and I don’t really understand much about what the functions should get as input, or what they return… So, I thought that maybe a more statically typed programming language might help, hopefully, my favorite one :).
 I’m looking for library recommendations that:
  
Allows me to write a simple CNN at first (like LeNET) and then maybe jump into other architectures (AlexNet maybe?)
 
Can run on an AMD Radeon GPU
 
Runs on windows? (not mandatory, but desirable since my it’s my tutors OS)
 
 Thanks in advanced

 I am trying to find a way to archive todo tasks in to a separate todo-archive.org file, but preserve the sub tree structure above, so for example if I archive Task 5, it will be archived in the following way, showing both the level 1 and 2 sub trees:
 * Project 1 ** Sub Project 2 *** DONE Task 5 
 I already tried adding another :ARCHIVE: property like this:
  :PROPERTIES: :ARCHIVE: todo-archive.txt::* Project 1/Sub Project 2 :END: 
 However this doesn&#x27;t work.
 Does anyone know of a solution?

                              <span>Using Doom Emacs. My modifications basically include
  
Adding packages to packages.el and
 I have defined my org directory in config.el
 I have defined custom todo keywords in config.el
 additionally I have created functions within my config.el to create org-ql queries which are relatively straight forward - basically sorting the above defined custom keywords in a view.
  
Configuration:
 GNU Emacs v29.1 nil
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre HEAD -&gt; master 844a82c4 2023-09-22 23:18:31 +0200
 Doom modules v23.09.0-pre HEAD -&gt; master 844a82c4 2023-09-22 23:18:31 +0200
 Issue:
 This whole setup was working wonderfully till about 2 weeks ago when I am not if I modified something by mistake or if it was because I ran doom upgrade.
 Now every time I try to call the function, I get : Error running timer ‘org-reveal’: (error &quot;‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer # (+doom-dashboard-mode)&quot;) [19 times]
 I have nuked my doom directory and reinstalled, yet I still get the same error. I furthermore tried starting emacs with &quot;emacs -Q&quot; and then inserting &quot;:org-mode&quot; but that also gives me the same error. What am I missing here?

 My hope in building this project is that it will be a base for people to build other things on top of it that involve programmatically editing Org files.

                              <span>Hi all. It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but I recently released Orgro 1.33.3 with simple editing support.
 At the moment you can:
  
Toggle list item checkboxes
 Cycle the TODO status on headlines
 Undo/redo changes
 Auto-save the edited document back to the original file, or if permissions don&#x27;t allow, then you will be prompted to share or discard the document
  
I&#x27;ve added lots of other improvements as well; see the changelog for details.
 I&#x27;m still thinking about other kinds of editing operations and how they can be exposed comfortably in a mobile UI (especially one that tries to mimic the &quot;native&quot; appearance of an Org Mode doc in Emacs). If you have ideas, suggestions, or other feedback, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.
 A final thing to mention is that I&#x27;m still a bit worried about Orgro making unwanted changes to files when saving them. I tried hard to be able to write files back verbatim (modulo edits), but if you notice any incidental changes then please report them.

                              <span>Can anyone give an overview of how to install treesitter for org-mode? I attempted via this package (https://github.com/milisims/tree-sitter-org) but it seems to be oriented towards Neovim, and I&#x27;m not sure what the actual process would be for installing a non-standard treesitter grammar. 
 I&#x27;m open to other ideas or avenues as well, this just seemed like the most complete option. Thanks in advance!

 +PROPERTY: CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL current

 Edit:
 I think I figured it out: org-use-property-inheritance needs to be set to non-nil.

 i find my self doing M-x and then searching for the command, sometimes there is a keybind that i will remember, but sometimes there is none, so is there a way to add a keybind to something directly from there? if not, then what is the easiest way to do so?

                              <span>Hi I am trying to copy my emacs configuration over to a new installation, but I am getting some error messages:
 ​
 ■ Error (use-package): doom-modeline/:init: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, compat
 ■ Error (use-package): doom-modeline/:catch: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, compat
 ■ Error (use-package): vertico/:init: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, compat

 ■ Error (use-package): doom-modeline/:init: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, compat
 ■ Error (use-package): doom-modeline/:catch: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, compat
 ​
 Does anyone know what this means? Everything works fine on my other computer. 
 I am using the emacs-git version on arch linux (30 something)
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>I was wondering how can I start ansi term in a separate window like as it&#x27;s own terminal not inside of emacs. I would also like to launch programs GUI programs inside of an emacs buffer. I got this idea from exwm I am not sure if the programs are actually running inside a buffer but I would like to know if its possible and how to do it.

                              <span>Is there an reliable way to have Emacs keybindings in the jupyter notebooks?
 Unfortunately, I cannot use emacs-jupyter because I am working on an assignment that uses animations. I tried ein but it does not produce animations. I am using Firenvim + neovim right now and while very useful I have issues with the editor size and position in the browser page. 
 I think that the best thing would be to have Emacs keybindings in the text areas. Is there any way to setup this in a reliable way? Some of the shortcuts are reserved by Firefox, such as Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, Ctrl-f etc.
 I am using Sway, so emacs-everywhere does not work.
 Thank you for any suggestion or pointers.

 I don&#x27;t care about vim, but i just want to learn vim keybindings (so that i can use it in a way you use internet explorer to install chrome/Firefox)
 Yesterday i wanted to use vim, but i was facing some problems (you can see my history), and after that i tried emacs (doom) and it worked like a charm, but i just want to know evil-mode keybindings, so is the game good to learn it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using centaur emacs which has dump-jump by default.
 I tried dump-jump on simple &quot;hello world&quot; and other cpp project and it doesn&#x27;t work. Definition is not found. 
 I tried on pop-os(emacs 29) and ubuntu(emacs 27). 
 ripgrep is installed on the PC.
 I tried to force it to be used with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher &#x27;rg) and (setq dumb-jump-prefer-searcher &#x27;rg) 
 I added (add-hook &#x27;xref-backend-functions #&#x27;dumb-jump-xref-activate) to use M-. 
 Also, put a .projectile and .dumbjump 
 I saw nothing with set-variable dumb-jump-debug t 
 I was expected it work easily because the search is with ripgrep only. 
 What could be wrong ?

                              <span>I use doom Emacs and it works well. Always I use multi frames for multi-tasks. Recently I find there is a few seconds stuck to show point of cursor in new frame when switch between frames, for example 2~3 seconds, so I will wait a few seconds after switch frames by &quot;Alt + Tab&quot;. Sometimes it feels bothered. Any clue to debug or tune this stuck? Thanks

                              <span>If any of you get sick of trying to scroll entire pages at once using C-v and M-v try adding this to your init file:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-.&quot;) &#x27;scroll-up-line)
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-,&quot;) &#x27;scroll-down-line)
 C-. and C-, feel pretty natural, and they aren&#x27;t bound by default. scroll-up-line and scroll-down-line aren&#x27;t bound by default either, and they&#x27;re nice cause they move the screen up or down a line instead of an entire page.

Now that the foundations are laid out, we decided to publish our work-in-progress specification. However, much remains to be done. In the coming months, we will integrate the missing pieces we mentioned at the beginning of this post.
 In the meantime, this specification can already serve as a reference for many core aspects of Scala 3.

                              <span>Hi there, I just had a question I wonder if someone could help me with.
 I recently came across The Guardian newspaper&#x27;s style guide checker, and thought something similar could be really useful to me in my work. The code for the project is open source on Github, so in theory it should be doable. However, apparently most of it is in Scala, and my programming experience is already very limited to basically only some beginner Python.
 How doable would it be to use The Guardian&#x27;s code as a base to create something similar myself, given this background? I&#x27;m willing to invest time and learning into it, but just wanted to ascertain the scale of the undertaking before committing to that.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any opinions or advice on this. Thank you very much!

                              <span>What I&#x27;m trying to do is to export an .ics file daily that can be imported to Google Calendar so that I can view all unfinished TODOs on my phone. In Emacs, I have org-agenda show the unfinished TODOs on today&#x27;s view. How can I achieve this when exporting to iCalendar?
 I&#x27;m currently using org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files to export the TODOs from all my agenda files. I don&#x27;t want to reschedule the TODOs to today, as many of them are recurring items and I don&#x27;t want the next repeat time to be based on today when I do mark them as DONE.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve just installed GHC 9.6.2 with &#x60;stack --resolver nightly-2023-09-26&#x60;.
 Previously, the GHC docs were installed along with GHC, but this doesn&#x27;t seem the case anymore: I can&#x27;t find the &quot;users_guide&quot; docs anywhere on my disk now. I did find the docs for the libraries and also for base, but the users guide seems to be absent.
 Has it not been packaged with the new GHC version, or am I missing a setting for stack? :)
 Could I download the docs separately from somewhere else? I can only find an online version and don&#x27;t want to use some kind of crawler.
 Regards,
 Hai

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use dependent types to make my code more typesafe and concise, while also being able to express precise invariants for it. One problem, though, is that I want, at some point, to read a list, which was previously saved to a files, that has it&#x27;s type parameterized to a Dependent Sum. The following example closely resembles code I&#x27;m writing at the moment (as this is an example, I don&#x27;t know if all pragmas need to compile the following are included in here. Please shout me out if corrections are needed):
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} import Data.Kind (Type) import Numeric.Natural (Natural) type Alt :: FooType -&gt; a -&gt; b type family Alt a b where Alt &#x27;Foo1 a &#x3D; a Alt &#x27;Foo2 a &#x3D; () data FooType &#x3D; Foo1 | Foo2 deriving (Show, Read) data SFooType :: FooType -&gt; Type where SFoo1 :: SFooType &#x27;Foo1 SFoo2 :: SFooType &#x27;Foo2 data Bar :: FooType -&gt; Type where Bar :: forall (s :: FooType). {a :: Alt s Integer, b :: Alt s Natural} -&gt; Bar s deriving instance Show (Bar &#x27;Foo1) deriving instance Show (Bar &#x27;Foo2) deriving instance Read (Bar &#x27;Foo1) deriving instance Read (Bar &#x27;Foo2) data SomeBar :: Type where SomeBar :: forall (s :: FooType). SFooType s -&gt; Bar s -&gt; SomeBar instance Show SomeBar where show (SomeBar s b) &#x3D; case s of SFoo1 -&gt; show @(Bar &#x27;Foo1) b SFoo2 -&gt; show @(Bar &#x27;Foo2) b 
 As you can see, I could figure out how to write show instances for a dependent sum. Read instances, though, are not as straight forward. I&#x27;ve tried, without success, to write an instance for it on my own.
 Now I want to hear from you. Am I approaching this from the wrong angle? If not, what would you suggest I do to make this possible?
 Thanks in advance, guys.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think my title explains this well. Basically, what I mean is that, as also the case with jupyter notebooks, if I am doing an analysis and I run a cell which updates a variable itself in a self-referential way, without forgetting to run the cell where it was initialized, I get the wrong output. Is there a way to make sure one if I run an src block that depends on another src block, that the dependent src block will run before the one that I am currently running. I realize, I would need to manually tie these together. I feel like something could be done w/ the preamble attribute and writing an elisp function that just runs another src block, but I don&#x27;t know how that elisp function would look. As an MWE, I imagine the functionality kind of looking like...
 #+name: initialize #+begin_src python x &#x3D; 5 #+end_src #+begin_src python :preamble (call_src &quot;initialize&quot;) x+&#x3D;1 #+end_src 
 I tried...
 (defun call_src (name) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block name) (org-babel-execute-src-block)) 
 but it seemed not to load the variables before running the cell (possibly because I am using Jupyter-Emacs w/ asynchronous src blocks). 
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>Background bits: I&#x27;m running 29.1 on a Mac (Big Sur) and installed Emacs via homebrew, and I use completely vanilla Emacs with my own config. For email I use Apple&#x27;s Mail app and a slip of a finger earlier today just revealed to me that for some reason basic Emacs keybindings are working when composing a message. C-n, C-p, C-a, C-e, C-f, C-b etc. 
 I have absolutely no clue why this should be the case, what I may have installed and forgot about, or how to go about finding out what&#x27;s going on. I assume there is an embarrassing and simple explanation that is hiding in plain sight? Thanks in advance for the pointers!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am newcomer to both Emacs and C++ so please be patient. I am trying to set up eglot + clangd. I have this in my config:
 (require &#x27;eglot)
 (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((c++-mode c-mode) &quot;clangd&quot;))
 (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure)
 (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure)
 and I have followed the instructions at https://clangd.llvm.org/installation and have version 12.0.1-19ubuntu3 of clangd installed.
 The project I am working on right now is compiled using CMake so I have also created &quot;compile_commands.json&quot; succesfully using cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS&#x3D;1 which should be loaded correctly as the *Eglot stderr* buffer gives me &quot;Loaded compilation database from ....&quot;
 However, several definitions using xref are not working, I just get &quot;No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point&quot;, and when I try to eglot-rename a variable I get &quot;jsonrpc-error: &quot;request id&#x3D;85 failed:&quot;, (jsonrpc-error-code . -32001), (jsonrpc-error-message . &quot;Cannot rename symbol: there is no symbol at the given location&quot;), (jsonrpc-error-data)&quot;. 
 Can somebody guide me in how to properly set up eglot + clangd or help me figuring out what is wrong?
 Thanks a bunch!

Now I have a problem with the header line: the line is far longer than what my screen allows to display, and I do not want the line to be continued as a second visual line, since it makes the align function useless.
 Instead I want to have to scroll right, in order to see the fields on the right.
 I guess I have to play with a kind of ~fill-column~ or ~auto-fill-mode~ but I do not understand the many finesses of these options.
 is there any visual post (with Screenshots and examples) explaining how to set this right?

                              <span>Hey fellow org-mode enthusiasts,
 I&#x27;m currently working on customizing my org-mode setup, and I&#x27;ve run into a little snag with Treemacs. I would like to have Treemacs display the #+title:property of my org files instead of the file name in the directory tree.
 I&#x27;ve scoured the documentation and tried various configurations, but I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve this. Has anyone successfully done this before or has any ideas on how to accomplish it?
 Here&#x27;s an example of what I mean:
 org code:
 #+TITLE: Project XYZ * My Awesome Project ** Task 1 ** Task 2 
 In Treemacs, instead of seeing &quot;My_Project.org,&quot; I would like it to display &quot;Project XYZ&quot; for that entry.
 The reason that i ask for this is that i am using OrgRoam and the file names start with a pretty large id.
 Any guidance, tips, or even pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 On a personal note, this was my first time executing the rather lengthy and finicky GHC release process. I took a ton of notes and hopefully I will be able to smooth off a lot of the rough edges before the next release cycle.

 Did I define the Api well ?

 also the official ones don&#x27;t mention in the description what version they cover. 
 Is this about ZIO2? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wsTIcHxJMeQ&amp;t&#x3D;1s 
 just want to avoid learning old content.

                              <span>I’m so mad at myself for being so stubborn, and yet I want this to work. Emacs can be so frustrating.
 I have to write a status report every two weeks that follows a specific format. I have created a template file for this. I would like to:
  
Prompt myself for a date using the calendar
 Create a file based on this date that I picked
 Use the selected date again in the template file to interpolate the date again
 Write this to the file created in step 2.
 Stretch goal: put the cursor in the first section. (I have %? in the template)
 I would like to have the capture template opened wherein I can ctrl+c ctrl+k to abandon
  
After having spent yesterday trying to accomplish this, I tried ChatGPT today. That didn’t go well.
 In the unlikely event I can get this figured out, I may try and add …</span>

I never use the tool bar and it makes the look and feel a lot more clean for me. Along the same veins are menu-bar-mode and scroll-bar-mode.
 My intention for this thread is as a sort of knowledge-sharing. I know for me, I wished I had discovered the above a lot earlier.

                              <span>I want to move point forward one line in a buffer other than the current one. This is part of a package I&#x27;m writing, so I&#x27;m talking about doing this programmatically, in code. My instinct is to use forward-line inside a call to with-current-buffer. My code didn&#x27;t work and I&#x27;ve isolated the problem -- my call to &#x60;forward-line&#x27; doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve tested outside the program and the same thing happens. Try the following code in a buffer other than scratch:
 (with-current-buffer &quot;*scratch*&quot; (forward-line)) 
 It should switch temporarily to scratch, call forward-line and switch back. It doesn&#x27;t do anything on my machine, even with emacs -q (no personal config file).
 I&#x27;m on 30.0.50.
 TIA!

 &quot;Stay in search mode in Vim by using ctrl-g and ctrl-t&quot;
 It&#x27;s very promising, but it&#x27;s not implemented by default.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been exploring Vim for the past 2 months, and i decided to invest sometime to learn my editor instead of relying on other people&#x27;s configs. It turns out to be quite complicated, so i decided that i would rather invest that time and effort in something like emacs. I tried doom for a few days, but i couldn&#x27;t get anything near the experience i had in Vim. i couldn&#x27;t even enable syntax highlighting for the different programming languages i use, so i would like to ask for any helpful resources about how to configure emacs as an IDE, videos, articles, books, well documented configs would be helpful Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s possible to use dir-locals, projectile, or some other scheme in order to map major modes to certain file types conditionally. Specifically, when working on static site generator projects, I routinely need markdown files to not only use web-mode (which I wouldn&#x27;t normally use for markdown), but I need web-mode to set its templating language to something specific. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to do this. With dir-locals, I&#x27;m afraid modifying the auto-mode-alist would leave it in a bad state if and when I move onto a different repo. Meanwhile, projectile doesn&#x27;t seem to have a clean way to hook into changing project types (unless you do it manually). Any suggestions?

2.12: https://tpolecat.github.io/2017/04/25/scalac-flags.html
 
2.13: https://nathankleyn.com/2019/05/13/recommended-scalac-flags-for-2-13/
 
 Has anyone published a list of flags for Scala 3? (Scala 3.3).
 Last time I used Scala 3 (3.0), a lot of options were missing. Has Scala 3.3 bridge the gap?
 I&#x27;m planning to try to upgrade one of our projects at work but looking for feedbacks on this before. A lot of these flags are mandatory to get the full power/safety of Scala IMHO.

                              <span>I have been using C++ (and some C#) professionally for about 5 years and enjoy it immensely. My next project is in Scala. What are some good resources targeted to folks with a native C++ programming background? I am particularly interested in understanding the nitty gritty of what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes.
 FWIW, I used to write a lot of Java in college.

                              <span>Hi all, Yesterday I asked you guys a question about cats vs native Scala. Thanks for your answers! They were all awesome!
 I spent few hours checking the job market for Scala jobs in Data Engineering (I&#x27;m a Data Engineer). But daaaaaaamn I really thought Scala/Spark was way more a thing! It&#x27;s really all PySpark now. What a disappointment 😢 Especially with Scala 3, honestly any data engineer who knows Python could easily write Spark job in Scala. 
 Hard to find the motivation to keep learning FP in Scala when the Scala opportunities are so limited. I guess it will teach me FP so that&#x27;s good. But there&#x27;s a depressing vibe to it.
 I guess only very big tech companies or banks or companies still relying on a on-premise infra may still use Scala.

                              <span>I want to add stack trace support for debugging purposes. I downloaded the GHC bindist (Fedora 33 with DWARF support) from the GHC download website and followed the instructions in the INSTALL file. I executed ./configure --prefix&#x3D;/home/user/ghc and then ran make install. The installation seemed to succeed, but when I ran ghc --info | grep libdw, it returned ,(&quot;RTS expects libdw&quot;,NO).
 What did I miss? Do I need to manually compile GHC from source instead?
 Thanks

                              <span>I was reading this and I noticed that the words before :: in an unordered list were highlighted and the colons themselves. I tested it in my Emacs and it works. It works in headlines too. Strangely, it doesn&#x27;t work in normal text or ordered lists. 
 My question is: What is this actually doing? What is the purpose? Does it just highlight, that&#x27;s it? If so, why did they add it?

                              <span>Is there a way to dynamically filter an agenda by todo state? For example , if my agenda shows items in TODO, WAITING, and DONE states, I&#x27;d like to press a key to filter it down to just the WAITING states - similar to org-agenda-filter-by-tag, etc, but for todo states.
 I realize I can use org-agenda-custom-commands to create canned commands of items in a certain todo state, but I&#x27;d like to be able to do it dynamically.
 Thanks!

                              <span>A few days ago my package llm was added to GNU ELPA. This package isn&#x27;t for end-users, it&#x27;s for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are &quot;large language models&quot;, very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.
 To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There&#x27;s obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic&#x27;s API, or Llama 2.
 The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn&#x27;t clear that there&#x27;s a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it&#x27;s pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I&#x27;ll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.
 If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I&#x27;d encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.

                              <span>MisTTY is a major mode for Emacs 29.1 and up that runs a shell inside of a buffer. It is built on top of term.el. It is available on MELPA. Check out its project page at https://github.com/szermatt/mistty.
 Such a buffer feels very much like comint mode: you can move around freely and run any Emacs command you want - until you press TAB and end up with the native completion or notice the shell autosuggestions. With MisTTY you have access to both Emacs and the shell commands and editing tools.
 Additionally, commands that take over the entire screen, such as less or vi also work, temporarily taking over the window, while scrollback remains available in another buffer.
 MisTTY works well with Bash and ZSH, but it is especially well suited to running the Fish shell; you get autosuggestions, and completions in full colors.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a theme with a few specific qualities, and was wondering if anyone might have some suggestions. Basically, here are my requirements:
  
Dark them with black background
 Predominantly white text
 Fairly high contrast, but with a subtle colour palette
  
I find a lot of dark themes are either low contrast, or the colour palette is mainly based on simple bright primary colours which I personally dislike.
 Anyone use a theme that sounds like it might fit the bill?

                              <span>Recently I declared init bankruptcy, upgraded to emacs 29 and configured for my webdev needs from scratch. 
 About 75% of my configuration was plain sailing. Most of the remaining 25% is related to completions. 
 One massive problem I have is the *completions* minibuffer. I hate it. 
 I don&#x27;t want a minibuffer for completions. I&#x27;m trying to bend company to my needs. But the *completions* minibuffer pops up anyway. And when it does, it is very intrusive. It changes the layout of my frames. And when I make it go away, the buffer that I&#x27;m working in is repositioned. 
 At the moment, it is the bane of my workflow. I&#x27;m working on a complex set of problems that require a lot of focus. And having my frames re-arranged unpredictably messes with my head. 
 My understanding is that the *completions* minifbuffer can&#x27;t be removed. Is there a way to prevent it from being invoked?

                              <span>I remember seeing someone put at the top of their init file something like:  ;; --:**-- init.el -- ;; Code:  so I did the same in mine. Just now, I saw that it said Elisp/d in my mode line, and the d was highlighted. I clicked it, and I got a comment -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- at the top of my file, and it said it enabled lexical binding.
 What are these special comments? It seems suspiciously similar to the above that I mentioned in seeing someone&#x27;s init file (whose style I copied) and it has an actual effect (when removed, the Elisp/d comes back instead of Elisp/l). Is there docs on these?
 Stylistically, these make me recall the sh shebangs, like #!/bin/sh.

                              <span>I just bisected my init file to find this issue, but doing (tool-bar-mode -1) causes a flash of white (regular emacs theme) or flash of theme-color (if do it after initialize your theme) and makes the emacs GUI hang for about half a second. I am running on macOS. Does anyone else have this issue? Should this be reported as a bug? In the meantime, I&#x27;ve put this in my early-init.el.
 edit: the same issue occurs with (scroll-bar-mode -1).

I found key-chord which somewhat emulates the functionality I need, but I want something easier/simpler to execute. 
 What are some ways I could let emacs know a key has been released even if it only works in the GUI version?

                              <span>hello guys, its me ya boi again 
 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and this subreddit. I was reading Learn You a Haskell and stumbled across this operator -: here, 
  
Haskell ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0))) (3,1)  When we apply the function landLeft 1 to (0,0) we get (1,0). Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting in (1,1). Finally two birds land on the left side, resulting in (3,1). We apply a function to something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we make a function like this: haskell x -: f &#x3D; f x  We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function: haskell ghci&gt; 100 -: (*3) 300 ghci&gt; True -: not False ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 2 (2,0)  By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable manner: haskell ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2 (3,1) 
  
according to my expert research at this point in time there was no pipe operator in Haskell, so I looked up and found this page.
 here two operators are mentioned -: and :-, used together, could allow us also use expression in infix notation, instead of just functions.
 I checked in ghci and there are no such operators available. are these old operators that were removed? what&#x27;s their story?

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m a noob Haskeller, 1 week experience.
 I was using GHC and a Makefile to compile and run and making a new file for every &quot;day&quot;. Eventually I wanted to use splitOn so I made a cabal project. Then I found out it automatically loads your modules into the repl with cabal repl which is sick. 
 Unfortunately I&#x27;m trying to work in modules/day3.hs and import rund3 to Main.hs and run it. However Cabal can&#x27;t see my non exported functions inside modules/day3.hs. this is a bit unfortunate.
 Solution I can think of is working inside Main then transferring to a different file when I&#x27;m done but maybe there&#x27;s a totally different set up that works better?

                              <span>hi, im new to Haskell and I wanted to install it and run a simple hello world program in intellij.
 However I cannot get it to compile and run in IntelliJ.
 It&#x27;s possible with the ghci console, but I am used to just click the run symbol in IntelliJ and it compiles (also for debugging). 
 I already installed the Haskell plugin for it (https://github.com/rikvdkleij/intellij-haskell/blob/master/README.md) and stack is installed via ghcup. 
 ​
 This is how it looks in IntelliJ:

                              <span>I gave Scala a try today and find everything slow to start. Running scala a.scala takes 2 seconds before seeing the Hello World message. Formatting in VSCode using scalafmt takes 30 seconds to finish. Running sbt takes a while before it reports error (this is because of scala slowness I guess?). Is this situation normal or I get something wrong with my setup?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I have a Java and Python background.
 I used Scala before to develop Spark jobs. That being said I haven&#x27;t dug too deep into the FP aspects of Scala.
 I&#x27;m planning to learn more in-depth about FP in Scala.
 After I understand the FP basics, would you recommend I dive into cats or perhaps it&#x27;s advisable to have some experience with &quot;native&quot; Scala first before digging into Cats or ZIO?
 I have no clue how overwhelming those libraries can be for a developer with very limited experience with FP. 
 Thanks again!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a novice using scala, but I&#x27;ve been programming with other languages for a while. I really enjoy writing SQL and type safe code. When using OCaml, this library is great: https://github.com/darioteixeira/pgocaml
 It uses a PPX macro which reads the raw SQL string before compilation and asks Postgres server for the data type which will be returned when the SQL would actually be executed. This way OCaml knows the return type of each SQL query even if they are just pure SQL.
 Is there anything similar for Scala? I searched quickly for Scala SQL libraries but they don&#x27;t seem to provide both raw SQL usage and high type safety.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a report generator that consists of a table with links. While I&#x27;d normally use groff because it has no dependencies and plays well with shell pipelines, mixing tables and links in groff barely works so I was going to generate LaTeX instead.
 Possibly interesting idea: have an org-mode literate program with code that generates other org-mode programs that ultimately end up as exportable in various forms using Make and emacs-lisp called in batch mode.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a long writing piece which I&#x27;d like to organize and edit in Emacs, but large swathes of it have already been written in LibreOffice Writer. There are plenty of italics and bolded keywords throughout the text and I can&#x27;t find an easy, pre-existing way to preserve them in Org mode markup.
 So far it seems the easiest means of automating this would be to dump the clipboard contents to an HTML file or other suitable in between and then write a script to process it into Org mode markup, but that seems ludicrous. I&#x27;d use Bash because that&#x27;s what I know—I can&#x27;t find a preexisting solution in Emacs elisp. There is a very, very old .odt importer called odt2org and it requires a now obsolete version of Python which I&#x27;d like to avoid setting up. 
 Literally copy/yanking the text from Writer into a text-file, and manually copying the italics would be faster. Am I missing something? I see lots about exporting from Emacs, but what about preserving formatting into Emacs? If there&#x27;s a means which includes formatting headers, block quotes into #+begin_quote/#+end_quote tags etc, that&#x27;d be perfect but I&#x27;ll settle for just italics and bold.

 &quot;EMACS stood for Editing Macros, before we realized that EMACS is composed of functions written in a programming language rather than macros in editor TECO&quot;.
 Should Emacs have been named Efuns?

                              <span>Ironically my Emacs journey started out not touching the Easy Customization Interface at all and has progressed to using it frequently. It occurred to me that It would a more pleasant UX experience if I could modify .dir-locals.el using the Easy Customization Interface. Does this already exist? Conceptually it doesn&#x27;t seem hard to implement so I feel like I&#x27;m just searching for the wrong terms.

 Usually， I work with swiper to search, ivy-occur to freeze the results in mini-buffer, then C-x C-q makes it editable for further actions.
 How could get such a workflow done with “M-x occur&quot; result?

 After much documentation reading and searching I ended up using C-u 49 C-f to move the cursor 49 days forward. How clever! 🤓
 Similarly, we can also use: - C-n, forward week - M-}, forward month - C-x ], forward year

                              <span>Indentation doesn’t work well for me out of the box in Emacs when working on a c file. E.g when a curly bracket is created it auto puts the closing one which is great. When I press enter it aligns it down nut right under e.g the if keyword. It would look like this:
 If () {
  }
 Are there packages for proper indentation for programming languages?

 Hi, I&#x27;m learning React 18 using ScalaJS 1.13.2 and Slinky 0.7.4+1-e3ba8c29. I&#x27;m having a hard time trying to maintain state in a React context.
 For the snippet below, status seems to reset every time I navigate between pages. I expect the state not to be reset since I&#x27;m using state from a context.
 I appreciate any help fixing this.

                              <span>I am writing a big calculator. This calculator has many, many inputs and many, many outputs. My fundamental type is a Partner. Conceptually it makes sense to associate both inputs and outputs with a Partner. Also, some of the outputs are both important on their own and as inputs to later parts of the calculation.
 My question is: how do I architect this in Haskell? I can imagine having a big Partner record type that has a field for each input and each output. The downside of this is I&#x27;d have to initialize it with empty values for all the outputs. Would I then make those a Maybe type? That might get annoying.
 Do I instead define a separate type for each new output as it&#x27;s calculated? Say we start with just a PartnerInput object that only holds the inputs. Then we calculate the first output and put the result in a PartnerInputAndFirstOutput object. I.e. the first function has type PartnerInput -&gt; PartnerInputAndFirstOutput. Then the next function has type PartnerInputAndFirstOutput -&gt; PartnerInputAndSecondOutput, and so on. Intuitively this feels silly.
 Like any good Haskeller I want to use the type system to help guarantee the correctness of my code, but I can&#x27;t figure out how in this case. I&#x27;m interested to hear your thoughts.

 I noticed that in emacs 29 this pattern no longer works. Does anyone have any idea as to how I could get that functionality again?

                              <span>This release fixes the default face definitions so that it is easy on eyes. (I&#x27;m sorry to take too long to fix it, I didn&#x27;t notice it earlier.)
 IWindow is an interactive window choosing and switching package, similar to Ace Window. Why not Ace Window? Because I use EXWM, and Ace Window&#x27;s window highlighting (which uses Avy) doesn&#x27;t work with EXWM buffers. I needed something more customizable, and IWindow was borned. By default it uses mode line to show window selection keys.

                              <span>I defined a custom link for exporting subfigures in latex (source)
 (org-link-set-parameters &quot;subfig&quot; :follow (lambda (file) (find-file file)) ;; :face &#x27;(:foreground &quot;white&quot; :weight bold :underline t) :display &#x27;full :export (lambda (file desc backend) (when (eq backend &#x27;latex) (if (string-match &quot;&gt;(\\(.+\\))&quot; desc) (concat &quot;\\subcaptionbox{&quot; (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\s+&gt;(.+)&quot; &quot;&quot; desc) &quot;}&quot; &quot;{\\includegraphics&quot; &quot;[&quot; (match-string 1 desc) &quot;]&quot; &quot;{&quot; file &quot;}}\n\\quad\n&quot;) (format &quot;\\begin{subfigure}\\includegraphics{%s}\\end{subfigure}&quot; desc file))))) 
 With this, I can write in org mode...
 #+caption: Lorem impsum dolor #+attr_latex: :options \centering #+begin_figure [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C &gt;(width&#x3D;0.6\textwidth)]] #+end_figure 
 and have it transcoded to latex like...
 \begin{figure} \centering \subcaptionbox{Caption of A}{\includegraphics[width&#x3D;0.2\textwidth]{example-image-a}} \quad \subcaptionbox{Caption of B}{\includegraphics[width&#x3D;0.2\textwidth]{example-image-b}} \subcaptionbox{Caption of C}{\includegraphics[width&#x3D;0.2\textwidth]{example-image-c}} \quad \end{figure} 
 I am wondering if it is possible to automatically automatically wrap consecutive subfigures in a centered figure environment, and add the space separator between them, ie. I want to be able to write just...
 [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C &gt;(width&#x3D;0.6\textwidth)]] 
 and have it transcode the same way as it does above.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

 int main() { while (something) { do something; } return 0; } 
 But I want the {} of the while loop to be under the while and not indented, like this:
 int main() { while (something) { do something; } return 0; } 
 Does anyone know how to edit aggressive-indent&#x27;s behaviour to do that?
 This is my current setup:
  (use-package aggressive-indent :ensure t :config (add-to-list &#x27;aggressive-indent-dont-indent-if &#x27;(and (derived-mode-p &#x27;c++-mode) (null (string-match &quot;\\([;{}]\\|\\b\\(if\\|for\\|while\\)\\b\\)&quot; (thing-at-point &#x27;line))))) (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook &#x27;aggressive-indent-mode))

                              <span>I was using Emacs 27.1 on Ubuntu recently, and then I made the switch to Debian 12 and Emacs 28.2. Emacs 28.2 gave me a ton of warnings about the packages I was using (managed with straight.el). I thought that was weird, so I built Emacs 29.1. All the warnings disappeared after that!
 I&#x27;m not an experienced user, so I wanted to ask here why some versions of Emacs seem to dislike my init.el and other versions are fine with it. Is there a way to avoid this in the future?

                              <span>I found this interesting concept on Howard Abrams&#x27; web page:
 https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/new-window-manager.html
 TLDR: he launches Emacs in fullscreen with xinitrc, but without EXWM. He uses xterm to start other applications such as firefox.
 I use Emacs with Sway, but I was wondering if anybody here is using Emacs as a window manager without EXWM or in some deeper synergy with some other minimal window manager. I have used EXWM and I already know what are the good and what are the bad parts. So I am interested in alternative ways in which Emacs can be used as a window manager.
 Another cool concept is here: http://perma-curious.eu/repo-ewx/
 Another window manager that could integrate well with Emacs, and perhaps even re-create the EXWM experience by writing some glue code in Elisp, could be river: https://github.com/riverwm/river
 I am collecting ideas so please feel free to share how Emacs integrates or controls your window manager.
 Thank you.

                              <span>What is Haskell code&#x27;s time complexity for classic algorithms, such as Dijkstra, sorting, and twoSum?
 Is it always the same as the code written in traditional language such as Java? 
 I personally find it impossible to solve some classic algorithm questions in Haskell and achieve the same time complexity.

 Do you think it&#x27;s a good time to move on?
 I&#x27;m using 2.13.x :)

 ​
 Is there any way to publish a .org file to HTML but showing the record of time invested in an activity?
 Today I use .org files for tracktime in my projects. And I publish them in HTML for my clients to access. But in some cases the &quot;Clock table&quot; is not enough because it summarizes everything and I cannot highlight the time invested in specific tasks by highlighting the days I worked.
 To get around this I am using two sections of &quot;Clock Tables&quot;, one summarizing everything and in the second section several &quot;clock tables&quot;, one per day (as shown in the print). But this format has proven confusing for some of my clients.
 I would like the daily log to appear in the HTML, the simple format of :logbook: would be interesting, but whenever I export it it is hidden.
 Thank you very much in advance.
