                              <span>I have been able to set up neovim with HLS in NixOs using home-manager, since i wanted syntax highlighting i added haskell-tools and tree-sitter and made sure to enable its haskell highlighting but... all the highlighting i get is green strings, everything else is white
 im fairly new to NixOs so i might have made a mistake, especially when im using home-manager to configure neovim 
 (i will leave a part of home.nix in the comments) (if im able to i will also leave a link to a screenshot to show the almost lack of highlighting)
 i would really appreciate help in setting up the highlighting (every other plugin i enabled works fine)

                              <span>I have this function to get the handle of a port and maybe convert its exception into a locatable custom error:
 type EvalResult a &#x3D; StateT [Env] (ExceptT SchemeError IO) a makePort :: IOMode -&gt; [LispVal] -&gt; Loc -&gt; EvalResult LispVal makePort mode [String filename] loc &#x3D; do handle  throwError $ IOErr err loc Right h -&gt; return $ Port h 
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to properly lift the try value to match the transformer stack.
 Right now the error says: &quot;Expected: IO (Either IOError Handle), Actual: t0 IO (Either IOError Handle)&quot; when doing the lift operation. However I dont know how to remove the t0 type-var to properly match the type. Doing liftIO mismatches IO (Either ...) with StateT.

What would be some good open source projects to contribute, and if you guys have any, can you let me know ? Thanks

                              <span>Hi there. I had an idea for a package, but it&#x27;s the sort of thing that feels like it must already exist, and I&#x27;d love to look at existing packages before reinventing the wheel. 
 The basic idea would be that you could schedule code to run using org agenda entries with timestamps. For example, you could write an entry like 
 * Update the package cache :exec: :PROPERTIES: :TaskName: update-package-cache :END:  
 Then you&#x27;d define a search like +exec and associate functions to various task names. The package would provide a function/mode to set up timers to watch the agenda and run scheduled tasks when emacs is idle within the scheduled window. Maybe if the entry is a TODO, update the timestamp with org-mark-done.
 But yeah, this feels like the sort of thing that would already exist in some form. I&#x27;ve seen a few packages to notify about tasks, but not to act on them more generally. If anyone has any leads/thoughts, I&#x27;d appreciate it. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started learning emacs recently, and after some experimentation I decided that I want to experience vanilla emacs navigation keybindings (moving the point around with C-f / C-n etc), without evil/meow/boon etc.
 I am a casual vim user, and otherwise used JetBrains IDEs for like 15 years now. I&#x27;m trying to switch to emacs to be more productive with editing code, because I feel like I use the mouse too much in JetBrains and it slows me down.
 Needless to say, I am suffering and it feels like torture. My question is that: are the vanilla emacs keybindings viable? Can you get used to it and be as fast as in vim, or as in other editors? Is anyone using the default keybindings, or are you all just rebinding those?
 If yes, how long it took for you to get used to it?

                              <span>I need to access multiple docker containers with the same name deployed on different servers. I connect to then using eshell with command like this:
 cd &quot;/ssh:username@host|docker:container_name:/&quot; 
 Emacs functions like dired, find-file, etc work fine. However actual shell commands involving binaries on remote do not pick correct host. Emacs somehow remembered the first host that I accessed container with this name first and always runs shell commands there. Even if I explicitly run 
 &quot;/ssh:username@host_that_I_need|docker:container_name:/bin/bash&quot; 
 it always runs
 &quot;/ssh:username@emacs_favorite_host|docker:container_name:/bin/bash&quot; 
 When I do &quot;C-x C-f&quot; and just type &quot;/docker:container_name:/&quot; it also goes to &quot;emacs_favorite_host&quot;. Do I need to configure something or this is how TRAMP normally works?

 I have the following line in my Emacs settings file:
 (setq elpy-project-root &quot;~/Development&quot;)
 However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as expected. I still have to manually call elpy-set-project-root from within Emacs. However, this isn&#x27;t persistent. As soon as I jump to a file and it resets to the directory of the currently opened file.
 How can I permanently set the project root in Elpy?
 Thanks in advance!

 I remember that during the commit process I pressed the wrong key at some stage or clicked in the magit buffer and got prompted about running some kind of git command which I aborted.
 Could that process have left some temporary files created with the .work extension?

                              <span>It has often been debated here whether we should use folgezettel in the digital context, often contrasted with the &quot;timestamp method&quot;. This post is not intended to rekindle that debate (and that false dichotomy, as I now see it), but merely to report my method and how it helps me, in case others find it useful.
I exclusively used the timestamp method until I read the Bob Doto book, which completely changed by Zk practice, and now I happily merge the two.
First, the benefits of the two methods, as I have seen them expressed here. The timestamp method is flexible, and does not force us to choose a pre-meditated structure; the ZK can grow organically. The folgezettel, on the other hand, helps maintain some coherence in a sequence of notes, keeping the historical context in which notes were ar…</span>

                              <span>Being interested in Miso, I&#x27;ve noticed that it now supports the GHC WebAssembly backend, which is great. One concern I have is that HLS doesn&#x27;t support the GHC WebAssembly and JS backends. (edit: I have managed to make HLS work with Miso, see comment) I&#x27;m interested in using Haskell on the frontend and would like to ask the sub a few questions.
  
If you&#x27;ve used Haskell on the frontend recently, what was your stack and how was your experience?
 In your opinion, what are the Haskell frontend setups with the best developer experience at the moment?
 Is Haskell on the frontend with HLS support likely to ever happen? Are there specific problems an individual developer can contribute toward solving to make it possible?

                              <span>Reading the thread of remaking emacs in a modern environment, apart from the C-core fixes and improvements, as always there were a lot of comments about elisp.
 There are a lot of people that criticize elisp. Ones do because they don&#x27;t like or directly hate the lisp family, they hate the parentheses, believe that it&#x27;s &quot;unreadable&quot;, etc.; others do because they think it would be better if we had common lisp or scheme instead of elisp, a more general lisp instead of a &quot;specialized lisp&quot; (?).
 Just so you understand a bit better my point of view: I like programming, but I haven&#x27;t been to university yet, so I probably don&#x27;t understand a chunk of the most theoric part of programming languages. When I program (and I&#x27;m not fiddling with my config), I mainly do so In low level, imperative programming languages (Mostly C, but I&#x27;ve been studying cpp and java) and python.
 That said, what makes elisp a great language for emacs (for those who it is)?
  
Is it because of it being a functional language? Why? Then, do you feel other functional languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being a &quot;meta-programming language&quot;? (whatever that means exactly) why? Then, do you feel other metaprogramming languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being reflective? Why? Then do you feel other reflective languages could accomplish the same? Why/why no?
 
Is it because of it being a lisp? Why? Do you think other lisp dialects would be better?
 
Is it because it&#x27;s easier than other languages to implement the interpreter in C?
 
 Thanks

                              <span>Good morning everybody,
 I am glad to say that I&#x27;m getting used to elisp. This is my second attempt on making an emacs package. This is called entr-runner.el, it permits to run custom commands on file or directory change directly inside emacs. 
 Check it out on : https://github.com/SamuelVanie/entr-runner.el
 I&#x27;ll be happy to get feedbacks on the source code or any other things that will make a student like me a better programmer.

                              <span>After using Spacemacs for long time, I decided to give a try at setting up my vanilla config!
 I soon noticed that default themes like tango-dark come with highlight face that is too bright for my taste + it removes the coloring from the text it is highlighting, since it sets the whole highlighted text to the same foreground.
 I ended up setting the face attributes for highlight so that foreground is unspecified, and so that background is darker (I set it to default but darkened a bit further -&gt; I found this works great for any theme, in my opinion.
 I did a similar thing for region face.
 The part where I struggle now is consistently executing this on theme-load -&gt; I sometimes change themes and I would love if this get applied after any theme change.

 My solution was to hook server-after-make-frame to run some applescript which brings emacs to the front. It&#x27;s not perfect, since it brings all emacs frames to the front, but I rarely have more than one or two, and it solves my immediate problem of having to hunt down my new frame.
 (defun initd/bring-emacs-to-front () &quot;Using applescript, force the Emacs frame to be activated.&quot; (when (eq system-type &#x27;darwin) (start-process &quot;bring-emacs-to-front&quot; nil &quot;osascript&quot; &quot;-e&quot; &quot;tell application \&quot;Emacs\&quot; to activate&quot;))) (add-hook &#x27;server-after-make-frame-hook #&#x27;initd/bring-emacs-to-front)

                              <span>Basically the title. I think I remember reading somewhere it was officially recommended to switch the file extension to .txt and not use the unique .org extension as they are functionally the same. Both are plain text formats, you might just have different txt files, that are not formatted in orgdown there too. Is that all or have I missed something? Is there an actual downside like a dependency of org-roam that you end up in dependency hell if you decide to use txt or another file extension instead of .org. Bc otherwise everytime you don&#x27;t have an org parser around and are on a system like a tablet, it will straight up refuse to open the file, locking you out of your data complete. This can be avoided by using orgdown formatting, but utilizing the .txt extension. 
 Cheers and thanks for your insights

                              <span>Is it possible to specify that members of a PROPERTIES block should always come in a specific order?
 For example, when I create an entry, I set a CREATED property value with the current date. If I change the entry later, I use the org-set-property function to add a MODIFIED property with the date of the change. I would very much like the MODIFIED entry to be inserted immediately following the CREATED property. Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi! basically i am mostly trying to set up an IDE in which i could comfortably write haskell in nixos
 i should say that i am pretty new to nixos and i dont have much of a clue about what im doing...
 im trying to set up neovim, but if it happens so that VSC is simpler to set up, i will happily jump on that oportunity.
 i have tried to use home-manager to declare the haskell-tools plugin but i was not able to get it to work.
 any help is greatly appreciated! and im sorry if i should have asked in the nixos subreddit.

                              <span>Hello Haskellers,
 I&#x27;m writing a C compiler. In the assembly generation stage, an abstract syntax tree is converted into a List of x64 instructions.
 To model a C language expression as an AST node, I used this algebraic type:
 data Expression &#x3D; Value Int | Unary Uop Expression | Binary Bop Expression Expression
 The Expression type is used to represented nested unary and binary expressions such as -2, -(~2), 1+3, (6 *2) + (5* (9 -2)), etc... Uop and Bop are unary and binary operators, respectively.
 Parsing these expressions recursively looks like a classic fold operation, and I implemented my own folding function that works. But I can&#x27;t help but feel there&#x27;s a better approach to this, a better abstraction to traverse a recursive data structure and &quot;flatten&quot; it into a List.
 Obviously I can&#x27;t use Foldable since the datatype is not kind &#x60;* -&gt; *&#x60;. Would it make sense to use a phantom type so that Expression is of kind &#x60;* -&gt; *&#x60;?
 Any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

 Is this possible? I guess I need to add a hook but can&#x27;t seem to get it to work. Thank you!

 I have emacs server running and emacs-everywhere installed from MELPA.
 Anyone perhaps have a suggestion on how to fix this?

                              <span>Hello, reading the use-package docs, I found that it has support for both diminish and delight.
 At first sight, they seem pretty similar. Both can hide modes, or change how they are displayed on the mode line; although I believe delight has a couple extra features.
 The Emacs manual recommends going for diminish if you have doubts, but why is that so? 
 What are their most important differences?
 Thanks

Since people always wonder how to use many of Hyperbole&#x27;s features together, leaning towards the Videos rather than Hyperbole Use Cases, I asked it to explain how to use buttons and Hyperbole&#x27;s subsystems together on a work task. This is the result. (Install Hyperbole as an Emacs package from melpa or elpa-devel).
 The Hyperbole manual provides a wealth of information about Hyperbole&#x27;s individual features, but let&#x27;s explore how they can work together to achieve a specific work goal. Imagine you&#x27;re working on a research project that involves:
  
Gathering information from various sources (websites, files, research papers)

 I had nothing to do last weekend so I wrote a small package for a mode-line.
 Its not (a) very:
 ...customizable
 ...stable or bug free
 ...likely it work in terminal
 ...good name of mode line (sorry)
 ...to work with people that don&#x27;t use Evil/Project.
 It is though:
 ... very fun to do stuff so why not write a mode-line
 ... likely someone finds it useful
 Feel free to do PR or add bugs.
 Cocaine-line repo at GitHub
 Before anyone asks. The theme is mito-laser port from NVChad. It will has it own repo soon.

                              <span>Hi everybody, 
 I am trying to build a template with minad&#x27;s &#x27;tempel&#x27; package. I want to mimic the behaviour found in this excellent article that uses yasnippet, specifically the &quot;faster frac&quot; bit https://karthinks.com/software/latex-input-for-impatient-scholars/#faster-frac
 Basically, I want to write for instance &quot;3 fra&quot; then I hit my tempel-complete key and then it expands to &quot;\frac{3}{}&quot;. 
 I tried some variants and I tried to inspire myself of karthinks snippets, so I have the following template : 
 (fra (progn (backward-sexp) (kill-sexp)) &quot;\\frac{&quot; (current-kill 0) &quot;}{&quot; p &quot;} &quot; q)
 But, there is a problem. The placeholder p is not registered, the expansion is this &quot;\frac{3}{} &quot;. It quits directly I think. 
 Can someone help me ? I don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s happening. Why is the placeholder p skipped ?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m facing an issue when trying to run a compiled Scala object. Here is the code from my Twofer.scala file:
 object Twofer {
 def twofer(name: String &#x3D; &quot;you&quot;): String &#x3D; {
 s&quot;One for $name, one for me.&quot;
 }
 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; {
 println(twofer())
 println(twofer(&quot;Leonardo&quot;))
 }
 }
 I compiled the file using the command: scalac Twofer.scala
 The .class files were generated correctly: &#x27;Twofer$.class&#x27; Twofer.class Twofer.scala Twofer.tasty
 However, when I try to run the compiled object using: scala Twofer
 I get the following error: [error] Twofer is not a scala sub-command and it is not a valid path to an input file or directory.
 Try viewing the relevant help to see the list of available sub-commands and options.
 scala --help
 I also tried with the classpath: scala -cp . Twofer
 But the error persists. Can anyone help me resolve this issue?

 If you had tried the integrations with other effect systems before, give it a try again and please report any issues!
 New Features
  
More flexible integration with ZIO and cats-effect: The integrations were previously implemented with custom effects, which had limitations with some Async operations. The new implementation is based directly on Async, allowing unrestricted use of ZIO and cats-effect computations with Kyo&#x27;s async primitives.
 Safe class tags: The kyo-data module provides an alternative to Scala&#x27;s ClassTag that can express union, intersection, and literal types. The SafeClassTag implementation ensures materialized tags always properly represent their types without falling back to java.lang.Object for special types like Any…</span>

                              <span>I am using Parsec to write a math parser. The code here is working fine for parsing a number, either an Int or a Float but always returning a Float in Haskell (I want to add support for different types of numbers in the calculator later but for now its all floats).
 pNumber :: Parser MathExpr pNumber &#x3D; N  (try pFloat try pInt  &quot;number&quot;)  many1 digit pFloat :: Parser Float pFloat &#x3D; try $ read  do whole  parse (pNumber  parse (pNumber  (try pInt  try pFloat  &quot;number&quot;) I get parse errors on the same input for decimal numbers:
 *Main Text.Parsec&gt; parse (pNumber  parse (pNumber &lt;* eof) &quot;&quot; &quot;0.5&quot; Left (line 1, column 2): unexpected &#x27;.&#x27; expecting digit or end of input 
 Anyone know why this is happening? I have thrown trys all over to avoid consuming input when I don&#x27;t want to.

                              <span>I have used conduit a bit (not extensively, but somewhat) but I&#x27;m poking around at other streaming libraries, and I&#x27;ve noticed most of them design their streams much like lists, for example, in streamly, SerialT m a analogous to [a], and has the same usual Functor, Applicative and Monad instances.
 conduit on the other hand, has it&#x27;s last parameter being a &quot;result&quot; type, which is NOT the output type of the stream, it&#x27;s just a completely different single value. And it also seems like the conduit code suggests you just compose things with await and yield, instead of using more standard combinators like fmap, mapM and fold (although their are Conduit specific versions of things like fmap and fold which one can use).
 I feel like the conduit interface is a bit more clunky and not as &quot;Haskell like&quot;. But I suspect there&#x27;s a benefit of this... there&#x27;s surely a reason why one would make the interface quite a bit different to what people are used to manipulating, namely lists?
 Could someone give some examples of things which work nicely in conduit but are clunky in more &quot;list like&quot; streaming libraries?
 Or are more recently developed streaming libraries just better than conduit in every way (which I find hard to believe)?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using evil mode and started using custom keybindings recently. General is great and all, but when I bind the space key as mod, it gets mixed up with evil keybindings and I have to press space a couple of times before which key pops up. So, is it possible to disable the space key(or any key really) in only the normal mode?

                              <span>For the life of me, I cannot get lsp-docker to work. My goal is to use lsp-docker with lsp-pyright and ruff server, but I&#x27;d be happy with just pyright or pylsp. I can always run ruff with flymake.
 Previously I used eglot + flymake for JVM but my new job has heavily leaned into Mac + VSCode&#x27;s devcontainers and in order to get a proper lsp environment and debugger I need to switch to lsp-mode + lsp-docker + dap-mode.
 The first step is getting lsp-mode connected to the webserver&#x27;s container which has pyright as a dev dependency.
 Note, I&#x27;m also new to Python coming from a JVM and Lisp on Linux background so I may be making Python or Mac errors. I am also completely new to developing inside containers, I have previously only used containers for deployments.

                              <span>Does anyone know how to contact Irreal (or http://irreal.org/blog/)?
 Their blog used to have comment functionality, but that is gone. I also could not find any email address or link to another profile.
 Since it appears to be difficult to come by this information, it could be that they don&#x27;t want their identity known (though I was able to dig up a real name), so please send me this information privately. Thanks for your help!
 Of course it would be easiest if Irreal themselves saw this, which they probably will eventually.

                              <span>Hey there, have my configs setup in an org file babeled out automatically with location being set by :tangle header properties. Wondering if there might be some built in mechanism to create a variable for things like different color formats on various things or. If not a way to list files set to be babeled by or so I could do it myself, I guess with a really long var name.

                              <span>Hi,
 A bit of background: I come from more of a math/physics background, and got drawn into functional programming late in college, then took a compilers course in my last semester (in OCAML) and got really into it. Have a journeyman level understanding of other languages, have worked in SW for three years and counting.
 I have been making my way through the haskell MOOC (the university of Helsinki one). I stumbled on these two books which, by the accounts I have read previously, seem to go into more depth mathematically with respect to haskell. In the mean time tryng build up on C++, and learning small bits of CL here and there as well to get more perspective and be a better problem solver overrall.
 So, what I&#x27;m asking:
 From my understanding, Hutton (Programming in Haskell) is drier than Bird (Thinking Functionally With Haskell), though both are solid texts with a good backing in math (i.e. strong on the &quot;equational reasoning&quot; front EDIT: category theory is welcome too), and wanted to see if there was a consensus on either of them, or at least consolidate people&#x27;s different opinions and experience between the two, especially from people who have read both. There hasn&#x27;t the been most testimony comparing and contrasting the two as I&#x27;ve seen scouring this subreddit.
 I ask because I would rather not approach FP just as a programmer but in addition and moreso as a computer scientist instead (in the way SICP aims to teach CS book and is not simply a Scheme tutorial).
 Other books that have come on my radar (for this purpose) are: The Haskell Book (aka Haskell from First Principles) and Introduction to Computation: Haskell, Logic and Automata.
 That&#x27;s about all, cheers!

                              <span>Hello, beginner here. I understand that the $ function, for function application, essentially creates parentheses around the rest of the expression which follows it. Likewise, I understand that the (.) function, for function composition, composes two functions together. I am trying to better understand the behavior of these two functions in the context of them being combined in a single expression.
 Function 1 and its return value are below;
 ghci&gt; zipWith max [1..5] [4..8] [4,5,6,7,8] 
 Now, we&#x27;ll add the function print and the (.) function
 Function 2 doesn&#x27;t function;
 ghci&gt; print . zipWith max [1..5] [4..8] :53:9: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘a -&gt; ()’ with actual type ‘[Integer]’ • Possible cause: ‘zipWith’ is applied to too many arguments In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘zipWith max [1, 2, 3, 4, ....] [4, 5, 6, 7, ....]’ In the expression: print . zipWith max [1, 2, 3, 4, ....] [4, 5, 6, 7, ....] In an equation for ‘it’: it &#x3D; print . zipWith max [1, 2, 3, ....] [4, 5, 6, ....] • Relevant bindings include it :: a -&gt; IO () (bound at :53:1) 
 * Note: I read this error message multiple times and am struggling to make sense of it.
 Now, we add the $ function between the two lists, and the function returns successfully.
 Function 3 and its return value are below;
 ghci&gt; print . zipWith max [1..5] $ [4..8] [4,5,6,7,8] 
 I don&#x27;t understand how the $ function affects function composition. Why is Function 1 fine, Function 3 fine, yet Function 2 produces an error?
 Thank you in advance

Is there a general way to approach this so that as I switch themes the color matches the currently selected theme.

 I&#x27;ve tried converting them with Pandoc like I can for markdown but I always get an error. Not sure if I need to use more flags other than the basic input and output one.
 I&#x27;ve look around and mainly just seen stuff on exporting and not importing. If there&#x27;s any macros or tools either built-in or that I can install that would be great to know. Ideally if it can do more than just JSON that would be great.
 Any help is appreciated.

 Anyone else have the experience that when editing elisp, aggressive-indent will erroneously indent docstrings unrelated to the editing context like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun function-i-am-writing () ;; copy paste edit incomplete fragments that cause indentation below point (let ((x &quot;x&quot;) ( )
 (defun foo () &quot;This is a function called foo. It accepts no parameters.&quot; )  ...edit code allowing aggressive-indent to do its thing...and BAM!...flymake complains about new issues such as indented docstrings...  (defun foo () &quot;This is a function called foo. It accepts no parameters.&quot; ; &lt;- this is erroneously indented ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; In emacs-lisp-mode, I do have
  (setq-local aggressive-indent-comments-too nil) 
 not that I&#x27;m sure this does anything.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m having an issue where I have to hold on to Ctrl for a moment, then g in order to quit. Namely, exiting out of a completion - and deactivating a mark.
 If I press C-g once, I see a Quit in the echo area, but it&#x27;s not quitting what I want it to. I have to hold Ctrl for a split-second, then g for it to work.
 Oddly this is only an issue if I&#x27;m focused on a buffer with display-line-numbers-mode on. If I turn it off, the problem goes away.
 This also only affects my Moonlander, a QMK keyboard. I tried using a standard keyboard and it was fine.
 I checked wevand the only difference is that the Moonlander registers the g input immediately (1 ms) after Ctrl, whereas the standard keyboard registered it around 100ms after.
 Is there a reason why keyboard-quit would not work if the interval between Ctrl and g is too short indisplay-line-numbers-mode? Is it because a keystroke will trigger some sort of background process or refresh - and that&#x27;s the process I&#x27;m quitting with C-g if I do it too quickly?
 Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas.

 (I&#x27;m using emacs-plus@29 on macOS Sequoia.)
 Edit: Thanks to those who answered. The --debug-init flag helped. There were relative paths (I’m guessing) along with customisation lines set by emacs. But deleting that block helped. I’ve since learnt that I can move it to its own file.

                              <span>I wrote some custom code around a year ago seeing if the scrolling-by-pixel functionality from the built-in pixel-scroll could be generalized to all scrolling commands. I forgot I was &quot;testing&quot; the code out every since then... I only remember today that I had been using this code all this time.
 I&#x27;ve pasted the code below. Essentially what this does is override scroll-up, scroll-down, and recenter such that every command that scrolls and recenters does so as if the user were scrolling-by-pixel. I was motivated to write this as a potential solution for the visual confusion that comes with (at least for me) quick, repeated scrolls and recentering (i.e. recenter-top-bottom). &#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (defun kb/pixel-recenter (&amp;optional arg redisplay) &quot;Similar torecenter&#x27; but with pixel scrolling.

                              <span>tl;dr What changes when emacs is launched from a shortcut vs the command line?
 When using a package which needs curl I get the following error:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ChatGPT(chatgpt-4o-latest/General)&gt; testcurl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificateMore details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In this case it is using chatgpt-shell, but it&#x27;s not exclusive to it.
 When I launch emacs with &#x27;emacs&#x27; from the terminal this issue is not present, when I launch it from a shortcut the issue is present. The .desktop file is using the exact same binary:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 !/usr/bin/env xdg-open
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name&#x3D;Emacs
 GenericName&#x3D;Text

 Terminal&#x3D;false
 Categories&#x3D;Development;TextEditor;
 StartupNotify&#x3D;true
 StartupWMClass&#x3D;Emacs &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I also tried a more minimal .desktop file and full path to the binary, /usr/bin/emacs in this case, with the same results.
 I know this issue is likely not caused by emacs itself, but in order to find the answer I think I&#x27;ll need to know how/why emacs is different when launched with /usr/bin/emacs in the terminal vs /usr/bin/emacs from a .desktop file?
 Does anyone have any ideas?

                              <span>How do I reset my Aquamacs Emacs user-init-file variable to its default value?
 My user-init-file got changed to the customary ~/.emacs. For Aquamacs, the standard is ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el. 
 I think I ran some faulty Python code in an org-mode code block (I wrote it!) that triggered my Aquamacs to hang up. I used my Mac OS to force quit Emacs and subordinate Python process. Upon restarting Aquamacs, I got an error about being unable to find emacsql file (error thrown from the initialization file .emacs). I used C-h v user-init-file to verify that the init file is in fact .emacs. How do I tell Aquamacs to use ~/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el instead of ~/.emacs?
 Thanks in advance for any help.

18 months of the Haskell Unfolder by Edsko de Vries, Andres Löh
Eighteen months ago we launched The Haskell Unfolder, a YouTube series where we discuss all things Haskell. From the beginning the goal was to cover as broad a spectrum of topics as possible, as well as show-case the work of many different people in the Haskell world. We’d like to think we succeeded at that; below you will find a summary of the topics covered in the first year and a half, organized roughly by category.

                              <span>hello everyone!
 was curious about how Logseq, my note-taking daily driver, and org-mode compare to each other. i&#x27;ll say i know next to nothing about org-mode and the usual text editors common in UNIX spaces apart from nano haha
 i like logseq mainly as it is a block-based outliner, and it has a workflow that heavily encourages using the journal / writing on daily notes, which thanks to its backlink features, tagging and very solid query system let you have a very efficient workflow where you just write stuff in the journal and then everything falls into place, given you configured stuff well.
 does org-mode let you have this same amount of &quot;mindlessness&quot; where you can just put notes, have them be organized by themselves and be done with it? i know you can add plugins in org-mode and other things but i wouldn&#x27;t know of how to go about it, so i thought it better to directly ask people who have experience with the software.
 cheers!

                              <span>I am considering switching to orgmode from Obsidian, so I am making the exact same post I made on Obsidian, since I would have a lot more incentive if orgmode or orgroam would have a way to do the things I mention in the following post, 
 Over the summer I changed my workflow by taking rigorous notes on the textbook I was working through, as a result I ended up with a beautifully distilled version of the chapters (pictured below).
 https://preview.redd.it/9pxpid8fvutd1.png?width&#x3D;1684&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;bf98f97a76d432b2530485811031a0fd6291e5b2
 Unfortunately even though these were great, this took too much time and I realized that I had spent a lot of time jotting down stuff that I could have just as easily highlighted. I needed to come up with a more efficient system, so after thinking about it for a while I came to the realization that the only new information in my notes would be of the following type:
  
Explaining a certain step of a derivation in more detail. (by adding more steps)
 Adding additional information that was relevant. (an alternate explanation or my own explanation)
 Connecting the given information with some other piece of information. (like how you link stuff in Obsidian)
  
That&#x27;s how I came to the realization that if I could have like the comment feature that you usually have in word, but with more obsidian features for pdfs then that would be a game changer. For example, being able to upload a textbook to obsidian, then highlight a word/sentence or para (or the space in the between them) and then be able to write comments on it (both in Latex and normal text) or to be able to link that with other notes.
 I would be extremely grateful if somebody could let me know if there is a way to implement these features.
 Thnx!

 I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs, but not to text editors. I use Neovim on day to day job and coding, but I do lack that feeling of IDEs where you can run the code without leaving the editor. And I think Emacs can help me with that (beside the OBVIOUS reason of org mode).
 I&#x27;ve seen some tutorials including the onde from DistroTube, System Crafters (if i&#x27;m not mistaken) and tried looking some documention (Of course all of it is nearly impossible in two weeks).
 But the feeling that prevails is overwhelmed by the possibilities. I know I can do ANYTHING in Emacs, but for now I want a good documentation resource with code (jupyter vibes).
 I know some things that I think I want, like magit, a fast LSP server, auto complete, syntax checking and efficient buffer management.
 Well, I know it is impossible to ask for this but what would you recommend to add to Emacs to make it look like an IDE but still keep room to grow any opinions are highly appreciated.
 P.S.: Is there a good resource to search for plugins based on user ratings or functions?

                              <span>I am using the urxvt terminal with i3wm on Arch Linux. I recently installed emacs to try it out, when i tried to run emacs it kept exiting without even showing the default emacs screen and logging Undefined color: &quot;[60]#141c21&quot;. I discovered this is the BG color i had set on ~/.Xresources ( the [60] stands for transparency out of 100 ). I should also point out I am using picom for the transparency.
 I tried changing the hex representation to an rgba one: rgba:0000/0000/0000/cccc. This also didn&#x27;t work, i searched if there was any way to make emacs ignore the terminal colors, or overwrite them, but i didn&#x27;t find a solution there. The only way emacs works now is if i supply -nw --color&#x3D;no.
 Is there any way to not change my .Xresources and have emacs work even with different colors?

                              <span>After receiving some great feedback from the Neovim community on a comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim, and later also a bunch of encouragement words talking about this idea on both r/neovim and r/emacs, I&#x27;ve been inspired to create something new*:
 Emacs-Kick — a lightweight, beginner-friendly Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim
  
Github: https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-kick
  
https://preview.redd.it/kg1oei01artd1.png?width&#x3D;1239&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;1ad6022340c96739e2bb79a24dcb1979a4657a60
 What Makes Emacs-Kick Special?
 While there are many Emacs kickstarter configs out there, Emacs-Kick is focused on providing a simple and accessible setup for Neovim users who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully dive into the Emacs way of doing things.
 Key Features:
  
Terminal-first: No need for a GUI. Works seamlessly with tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and other terminal tools.
 Vim bindings by default: For a smooth transition from Neovim.
 Pre-configured Treesitter and LSP: Get up and running quickly with modern code features.
 Simple defaults inspired by kickstart.nvim: Familiar setup to help ease the learning curve.
  
The goal of Emacs-Kick is not to replace Neovim but to act as a secondary tool that you can experiment with. Whether you&#x27;re interested in trying out Emacs&#x27; unique features or just want to see what all the fuss is about, Emacs-Kick makes it easy to explore without being overwhelmed by complex setups like Doom or Spacemacs.
 I’m excited to share it with the community—feel free to try it out and reach out with any feedback or questions on GitHub. Let’s build something great together!

                              <span>So, I think this is kind of both a Git and Magit question, but I&#x27;m now lost in the middle of something and hoping like crazy I haven&#x27;t screwed anything up.
 It&#x27;s a common enough situation. I have a feature branch with many commits, and master has a few commits past the branch point. I desired to squash the commits and rebase my feature onto the current tip of master to stay updated.
 Here&#x27;s what I did:
  
I switched to master, and made sure to pull the local branch to the tip.
 
I switched to my working branch, and made sure the origin was pushed and up to date with the current commit level, and stashed the current modified files.
 I performed a rebase onto branch with r b and selected the local master branch.
 I rewrote the commit for the first commit of the series and squashed the rest.

                              <span>I love ido mode but I have one frustration with it. If I want to create a new file and the file name resembles an existing buffer I’m always switched to that buffer. I know why this happens, but as a web developer in svelte, this can be frustrating since many files are named for instance “+page.svelte” , and the only difference is the file path. So, I’ll dired my way to a path and try to create a new file right there, and instead jump over to an existing buffer elsewhere and totally not have created the new file I want.
 Anybody got suggestions on how I can force create a new file buffer right where I just navigated to with dired ,even if the buffer name matches some other buffer?
 My lame workaround is to create a weird name like xyzzyzzyzy.svelte , write or paste some code in it, save, c-x d to the dired, hit r to reload the directory list, and then rename the file to what I actually want. Pretty tedious.
 All ideas welcomed!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started learning Haskell yesterday, going through the &quot;blog generator&quot; tutorial. This page instructs me to implement even and odd using mutual recursion and decrementing by one. I&#x27;ve came up with this and tried it inghci:
 even num &#x3D; case num of 0 -&gt; True; _ -&gt; odd (num - 1)
 odd num &#x3D; case num of 0 -&gt; False; _ -&gt; even (num - 1)
 This works as expected and e.g. odd 9 produces True.
 Then, just for the lulz, I triedodd (-9), expecting it to crash the interpreter. But, to my amazement, negative numbers also seem to work correctly and instantenously! What kind magic is this? Does it cause some kind of overflow that provides correct results by coincidence?

                              <span>Hi!
 I want to try Scotty web framework, but when i put it as build dependency in cabal file i get an error (below). Tried to build the same stuff on other machine, get the same result.
 In ghci session i can use scotty with command :set -package scotty.
 Any idea how to solve this? Or to try different framework (which one)?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m a beginner in using emacs (20++ years working in vim and recently nvim), for some time now I&#x27;ve been using org mode in emacs as a combination calendar/todo/notebook. I keep my files on a shared google drive, I&#x27;ve also connected it to org-mobile on my phone and generally it works ok, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.
 However, I recently read a book about building a second brain and decided to tidy up the system a bit. While writing or linking notes is not a problem, I probably don&#x27;t understand the idea of ​​tags/properties or I have something set up wrong with the search. No matter how I set tags in my notes, I can&#x27;t search for them. It looks a bit like the search only works in a few files that I have in my org-agenda-files(and even then not always) and nowhere else.
 I want to be able to search for topics, e.g. by tags in my entire &quot;second brain&quot; without adding them all to my agenda. I&#x27;m just afraid that soon I&#x27;ll have dozens (hundreds?) of files and emacs will take half an hour to start. What&#x27;s the best way to do it?
 P.S. I&#x27;ve been recently reading about org-roam , but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s a bit too complicated, especially since it requires a working database, which will severely limit file portability between platforms...

                              <span>I have been reading about the fast tag selection interface in the manual, and I would like to use it, but only in some cases.
 When I set tags for some kind of topics grouping, I am fine using the completion mini buffer, I still have too many tags to make a letter selection paractical. It also depends a lot on the context; mostly, am I tagging tasks or general notes, the former having far fewer &#x27;topic&#x27; tags.
 I have however a few tags that I use for maintenance purposes, or status indication like &#x27;DRAFT&#x27;, &#x27;WIP&#x27;, &#x27;REFILE&#x27;, etc... In those cases, the fast selection interface combined for mutually exclusive group tags is exactly what I need.
 I would rather not set the &#x60;TAGS&#x60; keyword in all of my files (I also use &#x60;org-roam&#x60; so I have a lot !), and I am trying to simply keep my settings as is…</span>

                              <span>I received on LinkedIn a couple of inMails from consultancy recruiters. It seems Apple is contracting a company to setup a « new team » (i read, not « new project »), but not hiring directly.
 Here is the message:
  
Hi I’m partnering with a global consultancy to build Apple’s new Scala team in Malmö, and we’re on the hunt for top talent to join this incredible journey! with a potential 5 year contract. If you&#x27;re ready to work on ground breaking projects with one of the world&#x27;s most iconic tech giants, I’d love to tell you more. Drop me your phone number and availability, and let’s chat! This could be your next big move!
  
It feels a bit like a scam, or at least like a dishonest approach, for instance if they have a retention problem on their Scala team and are hiring people to support their legacy.
 What do you think?

                              <span>Recently someone asked about filling (aka wrapping) text within columns. It&#x27;s a useful feature, so I added it to the simple package speedrect, which implements a little modal interface that comes alive during rectangle-selection mode.
 Just highlight a rectangular region of text (C-M-mouse-1 works great, or C-x SPACE then move), and hit f to wrap. The wrap width defaults to the rectangle&#x27;s width (e.g. to expand an existing wrapped block). Otherwise, use a numeric prefix (e.g. M-20 f) or regular prefix (C-u f) to prompt for the width. The selected rectangle&#x27;s height sets the height of the safe fill region (usually extending down to the next distinct &quot;row&quot; of data). If the newly filled text exceeds this height, additional lines are added below.
 speedrect has lots of other useful features for moving rectangles around, operating on them, and sending them back and forth to calc. To use it, just select a rectangle...

                              <span>I use Emacs with Evil. I often search in Org Mode headings thusly:
 /* .*foo / Start the search * Asterisk literal, followed by a space literal (signifying the end of any heading level) .* Any number of any character foo The search query 
 Is there either:
  
A better way to search headings?
  
or
  
A way to configure e.g. / to fill in /* .* as that is cumbersome to type, especially now that I&#x27;m in a cast?

                              <span>I&#x27;m setting up a deno dev loop in Emacs and I&#x27;m working from the deno site&#x27;s recommendations on editor config for Emacs and eglot:
 https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/#eglot
 elpaca is complaining about not being able to find js-mode and, agreed, I don&#x27;t see it on MELPA etc. I suspect perhaps something, for my version of emacs, has replaced js-mode? Or maybe for all versions of Emacs since the deno docs were written?
 Thoughts?
 Emacs version: GNU Emacs 29.4
 ty
 EDIT: LLMs say js2-mode has replaced js-mode however I&#x27;m seeing conflicting reports on that in this sub and elsewhere.

                              <span>I have this org file:
 | | 1 | i | j | k | | / | &lt; | | | | |---+---+----+----+----| | 1 | 1 | i | j | k | | i | i | -1 | k | -j | | j | j | k | -1 | | | k | k | j | -i | -1 | \quad | | 1 | i | j | k | | / | &lt; | | | | |---+---+----+----+----| | 1 | 1 | i | j | k | | i | i | -1 | k | -j | | j | j | k | -1 | | | k | k | j | -i | -1 | 
 That produces this TeX file:
 \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{l|llll} &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] \hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] i &amp; i &amp; -1 &amp; k &amp; -j\\[0pt] j &amp; j &amp; k &amp; -1 &amp; \\[0pt] k &amp; k &amp; j &amp; -i &amp; -1\\[0pt] \end{tabular} \end{center} \quad \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{l|llll} &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] \hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; i &amp; j &amp; k\\[0pt] i &amp; i &amp; -1 &amp; k &amp; -j\\[0pt] j &amp; j &amp; k &amp; -1 &amp; \\[0pt] k &amp; k &amp; j &amp; -i &amp; -1\\[0pt] \end{tabular} \end{center} 
 How do I disable the auto-centering? The only options on the manual page are to enable it
  
  
The answer was to set org-latex-tables-centered to nil.

                              <span>Wonderful folks of this sub-reddit, 
 I have decided to rebuild my emacs config (switching from Doom) and I am using the emacs-frosted from Homebrew. I have installed emacs@plus-30 (with native-comp) and while trying to run my initial run a lot of the packages are failing to build - and the error I get is &#x27;error invoking gcc driver&#x27;. 
 I am not at all a technical person but from a bit of googling around I understand this mainly has to do with setting the path from where Emacs calls this library. Apart from fixing this problem I would like to learn about this as well, so I have two questions -
  
I have gcc installed from Homebrew. It is situated in a bin folder under the cellar directory. I have two versions (14.1.0_2, 14.2.0). I have added the snippet below in my early-init -  (setenv &quot;LIBRARY_PATH&quot; &quot;/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/14.2.0/bin&quot;)  However this not solve my issue. 
 Do I need to do this in my earl-init, or can I just add this in my zhrsc profile? I do not understand whats the difference between both. 
  
PS - Yes, I have exec-from-shell package installed and I&#x27;ve added use-package in my init file.
 EDIT - Yes, I&#x27;m on Sequoia
 EDIT 2 - SOLVED - https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/733

                              <span>We are working on a project and need to both create SVGs and read our created SVGs (or also user supplied SVGs, but we can specify which SVG elemtns are allowed).
 When reading svgs we need to know which shapes are contained in the svgs (only circles and rectangles are relevant for us). If there are shapes using the svg , / in the file this would certainly make life easier for reading the svg.
 Mainly based on another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tlvopj/looking_for_svg_library_recommendations/ I&#x27;ve found the following libraries that supports both reading and writing:
  
svg-tree: Features both reading and writing. But reading and writing seems to not be super easy but I was able to accomplish both things as a POC. Also the documentation is almost non existent. For an easier to use writing interface I imagine that we could also use lucid-svg.
 
diagrams with diagrams-svg and diagrams-input: Features both reading and writing. The writing api is amazing and really well documented! And I was able to read an svg file created by the library into a Diagrams type. But I was not able to find a way how I can find out what shapes are contained in this Diagram (what circles and rectangles are there in the file?). It doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily possible, as it just saves Paths in the types and also in the file? But maybe I&#x27;m wrong. Unfortunately combining the writing API of diagrams and using the svg-tree library to parse them also doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily possible, as again, only paths are saved in the file.
 
 Does someone know whether this is possible using diagrams? Or does someone have any suggestions on a different library we could use to read or write an svg? (e.g. a better writing interface that will work together with svg-tree)
 Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

 I&#x27;m seeking input regarding Yampa&#x27;s API, public definitions, and module hierarchy (other possible improvements, such as documentation, examples, code style, test coverage, performance, etc. are out of the question).
 You can navigate Yampa&#x27;s API here:
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa-0.14.10
 If you have any thoughts, could you please help me by sharing them here: https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/discussions/312
 Thanks!

 It would be nice if it started from basic first principles with lots of concrete examples and then expanded to larger, more complex problems and their solutions.
 Is there anything like Scala Koans where the learning is integrated into an immediate problem-solving loop to better understand, ground, and integrate the new concepts?

                              <span>I’m aware that Python is hugely popular in the data engineering space, but I believe that this might be more due to its popularity than its actual advantages over other languages. Scala, in my opinion, has features that, if leveraged properly, can outperform Python in certain areas.
 I’m curious if anyone in our community here is using Scala exclusively for data engineering without relying on Python at all. I’ve been a full-stack software engineer working in Scala for over five years, and I’m considering transitioning to data engineering. Should I invest time in learning Python, or is focusing solely on Scala a viable option in this field? Would it be better to spend that time deepening my Scala skills in more advanced areas instead?

                              <span>Today when I opened up Emacs and ran the LaTeX previews in my org-file, the LaTeX font is suddenly rendered as very tiny, to such an extent that you cannot read the math. It worked fine yesterday and I have not played around with anything since that in my config. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Running org-version gives me &quot;Org mode version 9.6.15 (release_9.6.15 @ /snap/emacs/current/usr/share/emacs/29.4/lisp/org/)&quot;

                              <span>There is &#x60;Logview&#x60;, but it does not support JSON structured logs out of the box.
 I found this nice article detailing some useful commands such as keep-lines and flush-lines which are built-in.
 However, I would like to pretty print the logs first using the json-pretty-print-buffer command, and then run keep-lines to say, keep only logs that have the level field set to error.
 This doesn&#x27;t really work because it only matches the line itself (of course); it is not aware that is inside a JSON object, thus the rest of the JSON object is hidden.
 Is there a better way of doing this?
 And also, how do you usually trek through logs in Emacs?
 I really like lnav and being able to easily enable filters. It seems that keep-lines stacks, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an easy way to toggle filters?
 Thanks

                              <span>I really like the way Doom emacs works and the features it has, especially how it automatically makes your schedule and lists your todo&#x27;s for you, and be able to run code in the same place. I haven&#x27;t used org roam yet, but I have not found a proper tutorial on how to even enable it or just use it. But I also wish to have access to my doom emacs notes from any device I want, but i figured its a pain to set it up on my android for example. So i want opinions of people for wether i should switch or not, and how i can use it easily or make it more accessible

                              <span>If this is relevant I am Org/Org Roam on Doom Emacs. 
 As a writer with a severe case of ADHD I sometimes need the temptation of distraction. I am perfectly aware that it is not really possible to completely lock up Linux or Emacs, but just making it a bit harder to lose focus is often enough. So a simple function that made it so that I can&#x27;t leave the file I&#x27;m working at for the time being would be quite helpful.
 ALSO...
 If you feel compelled to say &quot;just make an effort instead&quot;, please don&#x27;t. Looking for ways to make my environment and tools less distracting is effort. 
 I&#x27;m glad you have good self control. I don&#x27;t. So keep this to yourself.

my-3x4-mode for writing in a 3x4 pixel pseudo-font in braille characters
 my-3x4-display-mode for displaying an existing buffer as such.
  
There is no good reason to do it, but after having defined the actual alphabet in a python converter script, it was fast to implement.
  
The Emacs Lisp modes: https://pastebin.com/zfbH40Je
 The Python script: https://pastebin.com/PJ1KKMKF
  
I strongly recommend against actually coding like this. Preferable use is for being \&quot;that\&quot; guy in a chat.

                              <span>Hi!
 I just upgraded my emacs, now I am using this org-mode version:
 Org mode version 9.7.11 
 But I am getting this nasty error:
 {lisp} Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Tab width in Org files must be 8, not 4. Please adjust your ‘tab-width’ settings for Org mode&quot;) error(&quot;Tab width in Org files must be 8, not %d. Please adjust your &#x60;tab-width&#x27; settings for Org mode&quot; 4) org-element--list-struct(8081) #(8081 element nil nil) org-element--parse-to(7594) org-element-at-point() org-at-item-p() org-indent-add-properties(# 10437 (0 2 0)) org-indent-initialize-buffer(# (0 2 0)) org-indent-initialize-agent() apply(org-indent-initialize-agent nil) timer-event-handler([t 0 0 200000 t org-indent-initialize-agent nil idle 0 nil]) 
 The Org release notes suggest to run this in existing org files:
 {lisp} (defun org-compat-adjust-tab-width-in-buffer (old-width) &quot;Adjust visual indentation from &#x60;tab-width&#x27; equal OLD-WIDTH to 8.&quot; (interactive &quot;nOld &#x60;tab-width&#x27;: &quot;) (cl-assert (derived-mode-p &#x27;org-mode)) (unless (&#x3D; old-width 8) (org-with-wide-buffer (goto-char (point-min)) (let (bound (repl (if (&lt; old-width 8) (make-string old-width ?\s) (concat &quot;\t&quot; (make-string (- old-width 8) ?\s))))) (while (re-search-forward &quot;^ *\t&quot; nil t) (skip-chars-forward &quot; \t&quot;) (setq bound (point-marker)) (forward-line 0) (while (search-forward &quot;\t&quot; bound t) (replace-match repl))))))) 
 But I am doing it, and (1) nothing changes when I run that code, (2) the error persists.
 What should I do?
 Thanks in advance

 What is it I&#x27;m missing? Have I found some bug in org-mode or is there some bug in my configuration?
 I thought it was something in the formula references, but after replacing them with column numbers the error still persists.
 Is there some other thing in the org configuration that can cause this?

                              <span>Hello fellow Emacsers. 
 Id like some tips on how to write a function that lists titles of all my open Tabs in a specific browser (Eg: Brave). Any clue on how to go about this? Do i need a specific browser plugin for this. Any browser doesnt matter. If I have a working example that simply assigns to a list variable, I can start off from there to add more functionality. (of course, needs a function that auto updates on a key combination).
 Edit: It&#x27;s on a Windows

                              <span>So I randomly decided to start learning Haskell (and FP) a few days ago and actually really enjoyed it. Some concepts were definitely a bit hard to grasp at first, but after figuring them out, I was almost instantly able to see how using said concept could be more beneficial than an imperative approach. That being said, I was somewhat disappointed when I learned that Haskell is considered to be &quot;niche&quot; in the software industry and that there aren&#x27;t as many jobs for it as there are for other FP langs like Scala (and of course Java), but there are certainly still a few. 
 For the minority of Haskell programmers who do it for a living, what exactly do you program? Do you prefer doing your work in Haskell as opposed to another FP language (e.g. Scala, Elixir, OCaml, Clojure...) as well as imperative languages (e.g. Python, Java, C#...)?

                              <span>Hi All,
 The Cask micro-framework is my go-to building block for REST services. It hits the productive, approachable sweet-spot for what scala could and should be IMHO.
 I’m also a fan of contract-first development for REST services, and noticed cask was missing as an option, so I took the liberty of providing one and wrote about it here.
 Beyond cask, I took the liberty of addressing a number of other issues I’ve found lacking in the other offerings: 
  
being able to just jar-up my generated code
 offer an easy example for bootstrapping my project
 have the generated code target both JVM and ScalaJS
 correctly implement validation, ‘additionalProperties’, and other open-api features
  
Anyway, it’s currently available, though perhaps alpha-quality (so comments / bug reports / contributors welcome)
 A big thank-you too to William Cheng and the wonderful maintainers of the openapi templates, and of course Li Haoyi for his excellent “Singapore stack” :-)

The promise of the Zettelkasten method is that it will allow you to create an artificial writing partner that will surprise you with new ideas and help you write high-quality texts.
However, the typical situation for inexperienced spectators is to be disappointed when they visit someone else&#x27;s Zettelkasten; they cannot see how a Zettelkasten lives up to its promise, and they cannot see the ghost in the box.
The underlying problem is that if you don&#x27;t understand the true nature of a Zettelkasten, you won&#x27;t be able to see the ghost in the box.
So, what is the true nature of a Zettelkasten? A Zettelkasten is a thinking environment. The ghost does not hide inside the box; it hides in the private mental process of a user interacting with his Zettelkasten.
How do you find the ghost in…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding that I frequently need to glimpse at or copy over code from one branch to another. For example, it would be amazing if I could view a function on one branch and modify it on another without needing to have two clones of the repo.
 How do you guys deal with this? Is there a nice Magit feature or Emacs package to handle this? I know that you can view diffs between branches with magit, but the diff menu can get a bit convoluted when you&#x27;ve made a ton of changes.

                              <span>Hi folks. I&#x27;ve been using emacs for 20+ years for C[++], Python, and a specialty language called SPIN, written by Parallax Inc for its Propeller and Propeller2 multicore microcontrollers. I have been living without TAGS for SPIN since the language was introduced in 2009 or so, but I&#x27;m wondering if this group can help me figure out how to make it work.
 SPIN syntax is similar to Pascal, but it uses indentation instead of BEGIN/END blocks. Single line comments start with a single quote (&quot;&#x27;&quot;) and are not ended. Multiline comments are bracketed with double curly braces (&quot;{{&quot; and &quot;}}&quot;). Global variables are typed by &quot;LONG,&quot; &quot;WORD&quot; or &quot;BYTE.&quot; Functions (&quot;methods&quot;) are untyped, always returning int32, and declared with &quot;PUB&quot; or &quot;PRI&quot;. The local variables are also untyped (all int32) and follow th…</span>

 But when typing in a .rs file I didn&#x27;t get any code completion. plus I&#x27;m using it on Windows10.

                              <span>So I am using tinymist as an LSP for typst files and it works for everything except formatting
 Here is my current configuration. I&#x27;m on emacs 29.4
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package typst-ts-mode :ensure (:type git :host sourcehut :repo &quot;meow_king/typst-ts-mode&quot; :files (:defaults &quot;*.el&quot;)) :config (setq-default eglot-workspace-configuration &#x27;(:exportPdf &quot;onSave&quot; :outputPath &quot;$root/target/$dir/$name&quot; :fontPaths [&quot;./fonts/&quot;] :formatterMode &quot;typstyle&quot;)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 An equivalent helix config works ootb.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [[language]] name &#x3D; &quot;typst&quot; auto-format &#x3D; true language-servers &#x3D; [&quot;tinymist&quot;]

 I get this in my minibuffer on invoking eglot-format-buffer
  eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability :documentFormattingProvider&#x27; 
 I found a (possibly) related neovim issue here
 Can someone help me fix this? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am an Emacs newbie. I am trying to setup eglot with use-package. According to eglot doc I need add eglot-ensure to c-mode-hook. But it cannot work. This is my configuration:
 (use-package eglot
 :after (cc-mode)
 :hook (c-mode-hook . eglot-ensure))
 When I press C-x C-e to eval it, I get (eglot-ensure) in minibuffer, it seems successful, but I get nil when I press C-h v to check value of c-mode-hook.
 And it will be work when I use following configuration:
 (use-package eglot
 :after (cc-mode)
 ;; :hook (c-mode-hook . eglot-ensure)
 :config
 (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure))
 I have readed use-package doc, and searched relevant posts in here. I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong there. 
 Thanks for everyone!

                              <span>https://www.twitch.tv/ultrono. The idea is to give a way for others to see and participate in a lecture when they cannot attend it and it is not being streamed or recorded. A quick look at the available videos, such as https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2267245752, should give some flavor. 
 A side effect may be to advertise some lesser known features available today in Emacs/AUCTeX/ELPA/…, such as automatic and live previews with correct numbering, folding for everything, etc. Any feedback welcome!

                              <span>i am trying to code a terminal snake game and when i run the the file with runghc it works as intended bur when i do with &quot;cabal run&quot; multithreading doesnt work so it only shows the board borders and it blocks,
 i set the -threaded option in the .cabal file and did a &quot;cabal clean&quot; to run it again and nothing changes, again it works as intended with runghc so what am i missing?
 [EDIT] i tryed compiling instead of runghc abd it also doesnt work, is there some ceremony needed to run concurrent programs? what am i missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at a company which has a cult like behaviour towards Haskell. I&#x27;m fairly decent in Haskell but don&#x27;t really mind using other languages. I understand that Haskell is a great language but the way my colleagues talk about Java or Python seems to be slightly fanatical. They keep harping on about how amazing Haskell is and how crap oop is. These are senior engineers and the way they are so opinionated makes me wary. From my POV, I think OOP or imperative languages are used in like 95% of all software which means they surely have something going for them because at the end of the day only the ones that make money matters.
 I think both have their usecases in different places but it&#x27;s just uncomfortable to be in an office that craps on OOP all the time with no effort on being at least slightly objective. How do I keep my sanity while working here or are they correct with their views?

                              <span>I&#x27;m spending many hours trying to make org-mode export to PDF look decent for business purposes and failing miserably. I&#x27;m aware how much more popular latex is in academic community, so it&#x27;s no surprise that out of the box export looks like an academic paper. However, my attempts to make it look more like an office document failed. A lot of basic features of org mode like tables or indentation are just not there out of the box.
 Does anyone have any ready made templates that I could just include and they would &quot;just work&quot;?
 Here is my current setup:
 headers.tex included at the top of the document: https://pastebin.com/9nYe45bP
 headers in org-mode documents:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \input{/home//latex/headers.tex} #+OPTIONS: \n:t #+OPTIONS: H:6 #+OPTIONS: toc:nil #+LATEX_COMPILER: xelatex 
 export command: emacsclient --eval &#x27;(progn (find-file &quot;.org&quot;) (org-latex-export-to-pdf))&#x27;

 It is for sure my most used key combination in Emacs, I use it way too much, so much so that I also accidentally press it when I am using other programs and it just quits because C-x is sometimes a shortcut for exit like in nano :(

                              <span>I recently started emacs for programming purpose. But it&#x27;s so rich i was thinking to myself if i can use it as my notepad. The thing is my main notepad program is CherryTree since it has hierarchial noting i use it for storing pdf files, texts, etc. it&#x27;s my personal archive. Do you think configuring emacs for this is worth the learning and time or stick to cherrytree for this? (In the long term i&#x27;ll probably use emacs for a lot of things besides programming in my linux distros, i currently use it in my win system.)

I can get python cells to run successfully in the notebook but none of the markdown in the page is rendered as markdown. Not even simple headers. I&#x27;ve tried toggling markdown mode, and I&#x27;ve tried installing poly-markdown. What&#x27;s the right way to debug this, and has anyone else had this issue?

                              <span>What is Aider
 Aider is an AI pair programming tool in the terminal. It allows you to pair program with large language models (LLMs) to edit code in your local Git repository. You can start a new project or work with an existing Git repo. Aider works best with GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can connect to almost any LLM. The GitHub page for Aider is GitHub - Aider-AI/aider: aider is AI pair programming in your terminal, and the project currently has nearly 20k stars.
 Aider has performed well in solving real coding problems on SWE-bench.
 Introducing Aider.el
 Recently, the Cursor editor has been gaining popularity. As a long-time Emacs user, I don&#x27;t want to switch to Cursor just because of AI. Currently, Aider only has plugins for Vim and VSCode, but Emacs has a tradition of integrating command-line tools. So I decided to write my own, as a humble attempt: GitHub - tninja/aider.el: aider emacs plugin forhttps://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider.
 This plugin offers the following advantages over using Aider directly from the command line:
  
Pop-up menu: No need to remember commands. (aider-transient-menu)
 Git repository-specific Aider sessions in Emacs: It automatically identifies the Git repository of the current file and creates a new Aider session for it. Multiple Aider sessions can exist for different Git repositories, allowing you to work on several repositories simultaneously without interference.
 Region-based refactor support: You can select a region (e.g., a code block) in a file and ask Aider to refactor it.
  
In fact, most of this plugin itself was generated using Aider / aider.el.
 If you&#x27;re interested in AI-assisted programming and, like me, prefer not to leave the Emacs environment, perhaps you could give Aider and aider.el a try. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you have about aider.el. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, Been using for vim for more than a decade, and wanted to change to emacs or say try it, I&#x27;m on MAC (M-series)primarily, so got a question. i want to try this from DT &quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;d1fgypEiQkE&amp;list&#x3D;PL5--8gKSku15e8lXf7aLICFmAHQVo0KXX&quot; but before putting the time and effort, would like to know, is it easier to setup, cause when i read some comments under the first video, lots of people complaining about package manager not able to install, something like that. And i didn&#x27;t see any responses to their comments. I researched about DOOM EMACS as well, and you guys suggest me to jump to that, or try this? I want to configure this as a hobby, and it wont disturb my work in any way, I used to use plain VI for a long time now, and don&#x27;t want to try vscode.

                              <span>Let me paint a picture for you all: I do some technical writing using org-mode (mostly papers on computer science), but I must confess I got a terrible spelling, both in my mother tongue and English, so spell checking is a must to everything I do. 
 I used to use flyspell + enchant, but it would cause severe lag (I tend to write hole documents in one file), so I have changed to jinx, and it&#x27;s amazing in terms of performance. One thing I think I could upgrade in my workflow, is that the suggestions are too far off the real word I mean, even thought the error is somewhat minor, most of the words I don&#x27;t even know existed! 
 On the other hand, I also have ltex installed, and its suggestions are 99% of the time on point, but it comes at the cost of only updating when I save the buffer and being somewhat slow. So to do a final pass is great, but to spell check while writing is impossible.
 One other thing I have seen in the past but never got my head around doing was using dabbrev to fix recurring mistakes, but I don&#x27;t think this would solve the problem. Another (crazy) idea is to use some small LLM to better predict the word based on context, but if LanguageTool can do it without it (I think), is there any other way?
 So, anyone have tackled those difficulties? I am accepting any tips or tricks you all have!

                              <span>I recently made this post describing a weird issue I have where Emacs frames are being automatically deleted.
  
 I followed u/mocam6o suggestion of using the following hook
 (add-hook &#x27;delete-frame-functions (lambda (_) (backtrace))) 
 and after a while I managed to catch Emacs in the act of killing frames. Here is an example backtrace:
 backtrace() (lambda (_) (backtrace))(#) run-hook-with-args((lambda (_) (backtrace)) #) delete-frame() funcall-interactively(delete-frame) repeat(nil) funcall-interactively(repeat nil) call-interactively(repeat) #f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #)() funcall-interactively(#f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #)) command-execute(#f(compiled-function () (interactive nil) #)) 
  
 By contrast, when I manually kill a frame (containing just a window with the *scratch* buffer), the backtrace is:
 backtrace() (lambda (_) (backtrace))(#) run-hook-with-args((lambda (_) (backtrace)) #) delete-frame() funcall-interactively(delete-frame) 
  
 The cause of the automatic deletion seems to be a compiled-function, and looking at other backtraces, the function seems to be associated with #.
  
 How do I find out the name or source of this compiled function, or work out how it&#x27;s being called? (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to find the source name of compiled code ...)

I would like to use exwm as my desktop manager, but I am not sure how to get it up and running, I was going to use systemcrafters tutorial on yt, but it looks like one of his pre requisites is downloading his emacs config, I&#x27;ve only been using emacs for half the year now and have just been learning slowly, I think I would like to keep my config as it is for the time being. His tutorial also differs in some details, compared to others, so there must be more than one way. I&#x27;m a little uncertain which one to follow. What would you suggest in my case? I can provide any relevant details if it would be helpful. 
 Thanks!!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to pick up emacs for the first time. I have been playing around with some basic customizations via elisp in my intit.el file after watching systemcrafters videos.
 I guess whats happening after reading around is that the customize GUI is injecting some settings into my init.el file?
 It was my understanding that the init.el isn&#x27;t &#x27;connected&#x27; to the GUI customize interface.
 I&#x27;ve added the following to the top of my init.el file for now to keep the settings that I can&#x27;t seem to control in another file. But I can&#x27;t help but think I don&#x27;t understand something or am doing something wrong....
 (setq custom-file &quot;~/.config/emacs/custom.el&quot;)
 (load custom-file)
 My question(s):
 When making your own configuration is it the Customize GUI, init.el, or both being used in conjunction with one another? Does it matter or should I be disabling the GUI interface?

                              <span>I know many people who use Emacs map CapsLock to Ctrl to avoid “Emacs pinky” and many vim/nvim users map it to esc since esc, the most used key in Vim, is far away from home row.
 So it seems the best solution would be to do a system-wide remapping to let CapsLock trigger esc when tapped and Ctrl when hold down (this can be achieved by keyd program on Linux and karabina elements on macOS). While this works, I found it to accidentally trigger esc frequently when I try to do movement or C-g in Emacs, which is annoying.
 I’m wondering if there is a better solution. I was thinking of disabling esc completely in Emacs (not sure if it’s achievable via .emacs file) as I’ve never used it but it seems like the esc key has its own use in Emacs.
 I’d love to know if anyone had a different workflow. I’d like to stop using keyd program as it seems to have issues with key repeat on my machine. By the way I use vanilla Emacs and have no intention to use evil mode. Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Did my Bachelors in CS in India, and currently doing my Masters in Belgium. We never had Scala in our Bachelors, so I&#x27;ve never learnt it. Currently, I have a subject called Software Architectures, and we use Scala in this. They took just 2 hours of class time to cover the basics of Scala. Brother what is this language? Where do I even begin with this? Any youtube tutorial or Udemy tutorial to learn the language?
 Thankyou!

                              <span>Hi, I am just learning play framework and trying a toy application with slick DB!
 But I am having a hard time using metals with methods suggestions or definitions support.
 For more info
 I am using scala 3.3.3, Play 2 +, Java 11, SBT 1.10
 Metals is updated as well 
 When I try to look at metals logs I don&#x27;t see any issue whatsoever which I can understand. From Doctor it gives yellow icon at semantic DB, also I am not able to find semantic db files through command (metals: semantic db file in vs code) 
 Mostly I am having those issues with any file that is doing anything with slick DB, for slick I am using play-slick 6.1
 which uses slick 3.5._ which is compatible with scala 3
 Please help, am I making any mistake or is it a metals problem!
 Also, in IntelliJ things are working well! But I can&#x27;t use IntelliJ in WSL (IntelliJ takes 10 gigs of ram alone in WSL) 
 https://reddit.com/link/1fwlnfc/video/lzx7pbkocwsd1/player
 I am attaching a video to demonstrate what I am facing !
 I want to have methods definition at least after typing &#x27;.&#x27; . 
 Another thing I want to point is that Compilation is working perfectly, see the red underlines that comes and go! But it is the definitions and autosuggestions that metals is not picking up !
 HELP !!

Link at the random &quot;note-to-note&quot; level, and add context about why I&#x27;m linking between the two notes


Link at the &quot;train of thoughts&quot; level: I have to spread out the related notes, read through them, and finally write down an idea from the book that matches the cluster of notes.</span>

                              <span>Hey, folks, new to Haskell. I find that I learn best by mucking up code - get some code to work, then try to refactor it to see it in a new light. Stuck on this gem and hope to get some insight from you all:
 Context: I&#x27;m working towards a text adventure app where you put the name of the adventure in as a command line argument: &#x60;LaunchAdventure --adventure myAdventure:&#x60;.
 This works:
 -- #1 greet :: AdventureOptions -&gt; IO () greet (AdventureOptions a ) &#x3D; putStrLn $ &quot;You chose: &#x27;&quot; ++ a ++ &quot;&#x27;.&quot; main :: IO () main &#x3D; (greet &#x3D;&gt; putStrLn &quot;And just for testing&quot; 
 Where parse is of type parse :: IO AdventureOptions (I&#x27;m using the optparse-applicative package as part of this experiment).
 What I want to do is to see if I can get rid of thegreet function completely. I&#x27;ve cobbled a few attempts together like these:
 -- #2 main &#x3D; \a -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;You chose: &#x27;&quot; ++ a ++ &quot;&#x27;.&quot; &#x3D; parse &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn $ &quot;You chose: &#x27;&quot; ++ (a :: AdventureOptions) ++ &quot;&#x27;.&quot; 
 But I keep running into errors like &quot;Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘[Char]’ with actual type ‘AdventureOptions’&quot; (with regards to a) or worse. I get what the error is saying; what I can&#x27;t figure out is how to solve it inline.
 The working greet example (#1) has the function declaration of greet :: AdventureOptions -&gt; IO () so I gather that that is how the compiler is inferring things there. How does one indicate that type in an inline fashion?
 Is &quot;casting&quot; a to AdventureOptions a possibility in some way? I know I&#x27;ve seen documentation regarding in-line type syntax, but can&#x27;t find a solid example that is applicable here. And is a lambda even the right thing to attempt here at all?

                              <span>Hello there! 👋
 After receiving some encouraging feedback from the Neovim community on a recent comparison I made between Emacs and Neovim (here), I’ve been inspired to create something new (new for me):
 Emacs-Kicks — a lightweight Emacs configuration inspired by kickstart.nvim.
 What sets this project apart from the many existing kickstart packages for Emacs? The main focus is to offer a simple, Neovim-user friendly setup for those who are curious about Emacs, without asking them to fully transition or embrace the entire &quot;Emacs way&quot; of doing things.
 Some key features:
  
No need for GUI, making it tmux, zellij, lazygit, starship, and terminal tool friendly
 Vim bindings as default
 Treesitter and LSP pre-configured
 Simple defaults based on kickstart.nvim for familiarity
  
The idea is for Emacs to act as a secondary tool, not as a replacement for Neovim, so users can experiment and explore Emacs without feeling overwhelmed by setups like Doom or Spacemacs.
 The project is almost ready, and I’d love to get feedback from the Emacs community. This could also be a helpful entry point for Neovim users who want to dip their toes into Emacs without too much complexity.
 If anyone would be interested in testing it or offering feedback, I’d love to hear your thoughts!
 Wish me luck over at r/neovim 😊

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ve had a disappointing day... I restarted my MacBook Pro this morning as an update required it. There&#x27;s me thinking &quot;what could go wrong, all MY stuff is in Emacs&quot; (side note, it&#x27;s not, I&#x27;m working towards it). Once the machine came back up, I have this weird issue where Emacs works, sort of. I can&#x27;t seem to open any org documents running Emacs in GUI mode, I just get the spinning beach ball and the machine locks up. I have to wait to force close Emacs before I regain control. I don&#x27;t use Emacs in the terminal (because I have the GUI and love it), however I have no issues with opening/editing/reading org files through emacs in terminal.
 I am wondering, has any one come across this issue today/in the past? Am I missing something (is there some manual I didn&#x27;t read - if you point it out and it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;m happy to look stupid for a little while, but please show me the answer)? Also, if there&#x27;s a load of &quot;I have no idea what you did&quot; then are there others out there to simply share in this misery (I had such a lovely set up, still got it, but this blemish (I hope it&#x27;s a blemish) is busting ma danglies.
 And if you just stopped by to read this guy crying in to the inter webs: Hi, I use Emacs (almost badly?) btw, nice to meet you - and you should really use Emacs hopefully it won&#x27;t slap you in the fan-dangles like it has me today.

 The actual link: https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/
 And the repo: https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist
 I&#x27;m interested in replicating a couple of features and was wondering if anyone else had a similar project I could build from.
 I&#x27;d like to replicate the code browse in columns depicted here: https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/vim-panes.jpg
 What might be more difficult would be replicating this history view: https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/history.jpg
 Does anyone know of a similar Emacs project?

                              <span>Doing academic research, I often have cases where I want to reference, for example, a specific chapter from a book (like collective works, or collected essays from one author). I create these as individual items in my library (exported as bibtex by Zotero/better bibtex but I don&#x27;t think that is important). I would like to be able to keep the notes for these chapters connected to the source book, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to get citar-open-notes to recognise this. Calling citar-open-notes for a new library item creates a new org file with the appropirate metadata (including roam-refs) and the citekey as the filename; this is fine default behaviour, but I&#x27;d like it to first check if the citekey already exists as a roam_refs property in another file before creating a new one.
 Can I get it to do this somehow? Thanks!

 Source code: https://github.com/eval-exec/cargo-jump-xref.el
 When i&#x27;m visiting cargo project&#x27;s Cargo.toml file, when I put cursor on a cargo dependency, I wanto to jump to the dependency&#x27;s source file, so I developed cargo-jump-xref.el. It will add a cargo-jump-xref to xref-backend-functions, then when you M-x xref-find-definitions on a Cargo dependency in Cargo.toml. It will jump to the dependency&#x27;s source file.

                              <span>Hello scala expert.
 I&#x27;m new in the scala world and i try to expose my swagger config from a scala api.
 Everything is working fine with finatra swagger.
 But one of my endpoint response is a case class with a property of type trait.
 With this response i will have my response correctly exported in definition but the CodedErrorContract trait will not be exported so i cannot generate client because of a missing object.
 Do you have an idea how to solve that with keeping my trait in the response.
 I know i could refactor my model to use class instead of a trait but i would try to avoid that solution.
 Thanks for your help
 case class Response( isError: Boolean, error: Option[CodedErrorContract] } @JsonDeserialize(as &#x3D; classOf[CodedErrorImpl]) trait CodedErrorContract { def message: String def errorCode: Int @transient def httpCode: Int &#x3D; 400 } object CodedErrorContract { type Ensured[+T] &#x3D; Either[Seq[CodedErrorContract], T] } case class CodedErrorImpl(message: String, errorCode: Int) extends CodedErrorContract

                              <span>Hey, we have just finished another live stream of a Scala Space Podcast episode! If you missed it, link to yt video is below. Our guest today was Billy Autrey, engineer working at Engflow on customer success with Bazel build tool and Engflow&#x27;s remote caching. We&#x27;ve talked about Bazel, its internals and ecosystem and massive Scala builds. We&#x27;ve also learned that sbt 2 will incorporate some of the lessons learned with Bazel. That in turn means some nice speedups are coming to your sbt build quite soon! View the podcast here:

                              <span>Hi,
 I am needing some assistance with a Haskell task. It is medium difficulty and will need knowledge of functional programming. Open to quotes.
 It involves creating a parser to convert special text to HTML.
 Thanks

                              <span>I’ve released library that helps to build web applications. It is situated between scotty and servant, avoiding complex types (where possible), while at the same time providing a typed interface and introspection capabilities.
 Here is “hello, world” using Minion. More can be found at Hackage (Web.Minion.Examples.*) and Github
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedLists #-} module Main where import Web.Minion import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp qualified as Warp main :: IO () main &#x3D; Warp.run 9001 app app :: ApplicationM IO app &#x3D; serve api api :: Router Void IO api &#x3D; &quot;api&quot; /&gt; [ &quot;about&quot; /&gt; handlePlainText u/String GET about , &quot;hello&quot; /&gt; capture u/String &quot;name&quot; .&gt; handlePlainText u/String GET hello ] where about &#x3D; pure &quot;Hello-World Minion server&quot; hello name &#x3D; pure $ &quot;Hello, &quot;  name  &quot;!&quot; 
 I assume that the library currently has some bugs and may have an inconvenient interface and not very detailed documentation. But I hope to solve these problems with the help of the community. Try it out in your projects, send bug reports, thank you.

                              <span>I have javascript code with section like this:
 const def_vs &#x3D;/*glsl*/&#x60;#version 300 es precision mediump float; in vec3 position; in vec2 texcoord; in vec3 color; out vec2 vtex; out vec3 vcolor; void main() { vcolor &#x3D; color; vtex &#x3D; texcoord; gl_Position &#x3D; vec4(position, 1); } &#x60;; 
 I was wondering if anyone here has used the packages polymode or MMM-mode for this type of purpose, where the file his highlited in one mode, but tagged strings are highlighted in another? Is either package better, or does anyone have usage tips? thanks.

                              <span>... and I see some older references to conf-mode and being able to tangle to a &quot;conf&quot; language. However, when I require conf-mode and then add &quot;(conf . t)&quot; to org-babel&#x27;s load languages it says it cannot find ob-conf.
 Anybody have advice as to the happy path on how to tangle up some plain-text / configuration files (for Literate DevOps)?
 I&#x27;d like to avoid a HEREDOC in a sh|shell|bash language block because that doesn&#x27;t lend itself to great syntax coloring. These tangles are as often InSpec code as they are plain-text. (No, the org-babel Ruby language support doesn&#x27;t like InSpec.)
 thx
 EDIT:
 - GNU Emacs 29.4 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.41, cairo version 1.18.0)
 - Org: Org mode version 9.6.15 (release_9.6.15 @ /gnu/store/ajigj8zcm0zxnbvk91148j9zkhxy3wc6-emacs-29.4/share/emacs/29.4/lisp/org/)
 EDIT: 
 It&#x27;s not a perfect solution but since neither &#x27;conf&#x27; nor &#x27;text&#x27; seems to work, I am able to use &#x27;org&#x27; to get what I want via an oddly indirect route:
 #+begin_src org :tangle /tmp/bash.rb describe os.family do it { should eq &#x27;debian&#x27; } end #+end_src

                              <span>I can only change the theme for the current session. I&#x27;ve been googling two days now, but I don&#x27;t find a straight answer. Any hint? Thank you :) 
 EDIT: the issue was solved, thank you all. After u/Great-Gecko asked to see my init file, I founded this line: (custom-enabled-themes &#x27;(dichromacy)). I changed dichromacy with wombat, and case closed. Thank you all.

 Hi everyone. I decided to give emacs a go and coming from vim, doom sounded like a good idea. I&#x27;m encountering a strange issue though. I&#x27;m getting two different lists of completions and the one in the background is focused. The only package I have turned on appears to be company. Has anyone else experienced and resolved this issue?

                              <span>Hi
 I have some simple org-babel code which I have reduced to a test case as follows
 # -*- mode:org ; eval:(visual-line-mode t) -*- #+name ruby-double #+begin_src ruby :var x&#x3D;2 puts x*2 #+end_src #+RESULTS: : 4 #+name: double #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var x&#x3D;2 (* 2 x) #+end_src #+RESULTS: double : 4 #+CALL: double(x&#x3D;4) #+RESULTS: : 8 #+CALL: ruby-double(x&#x3D;4) 
 Starting at the top I can run ruby-double on its own, double on its own, and the call to double with x&#x3D;4 by executing C-c C-c in the right place. 
 However when I try this on the call to ruby-double this line is not being recognized as code (because I get no code execution prompt) and I get no output and no error message in the minibuffer or in the *messages* buffer.
 The sequence gives the following in *messages*
 Evaluate this ruby code block on your system? (y or n) y Executing Ruby code block at position 68... Wrote /var/folders/50/9y75bf_x77q9fpz7rr32ykx40000gn/T/babel-ESjvl7/ob-input-LVBC7N Code block evaluation complete (took 0.1s). Evaluate this emacs-lisp code block (double) on your system?

Code block evaluation complete. 
 I seem to be missing a setting to allow ruby to be used in the #+CALL construct but I have been unable to find it anywhere.
 Does someone have a pointer to the cause of this, or possible, how to debug it.

I came up with a simple naive one and I know it wont be as performant as the optimal solution to this but I didnt expect it to be so bad that it failed over &quot;Memory exceeded&quot;. 
 Leetcode 102:
 Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes&#x27; values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
 object Solution { def levelOrder(root: TreeNode): List[List[Int]] &#x3D; { def lazyOrder(root: TreeNode): LazyList[LazyList[TreeNode]] &#x3D; { if (root &#x3D;&#x3D; null) return LazyList() lazy val levels: LazyList[LazyList[TreeNode]] &#x3D; LazyList(root) #:: (for { level  LazyList(node.left, node.right)).filter(_ !&#x3D; null) } yield nextlevel) levels } lazyOrder(root).map(_.toList.map(_.value)).toList } } Expected: Example 1: Input: root &#x3D; [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]] Example 2:Input: root &#x3D; [1] Output: [[1]] Example 3:Input: root &#x3D; [] Output: []

                              <span>After spending a while coding in Scala.
 Now that I get back to develop in Python. My Python code is very functional.
 The latest versions of Python allow structural pattern matching which is quite good.
 There are also some minimalist FP libraries. Some are more evolved. 
 I think Python isn&#x27;t such a bad candidate for some kind of FP lite.
 Obviously the lack tailrec recursion is problematic for FP.
 But not such a bad language to implement basic FP.
 Obviously it will depend on your definition of FP. 
 Do you implement some kind of FP in Python? Do you use any FP libraries?

                              <span>I think most of you have seen the article Fifteen ways to use Embark, and one of my favorites is 
 &#x60;&#x60; (eval-when-compile (defmacro my/embark-ace-action (fn) (defun ,(intern (concat &quot;my/embark-ace-&quot; (symbol-name fn))) () (interactive) (with-demoted-errors &quot;%s&quot; (require &#x27;ace-window) (let ((aw-dispatch-always t)) (aw-switch-to-window (aw-select nil)) (call-interactively (symbol-function &#x27;,fn)))))))
 (define-key embark-file-map (kbd &quot;o&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action find-file)) (define-key embark-buffer-map (kbd &quot;o&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action switch-to-buffer)) (define-key embark-bookmark-map (kbd &quot;o&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action bookmark-jump)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which allows me to:
  
Run consult-buffer and select the buffer I want spawned
 Run embark-act, press o
 Have ace-window show up, where I can select where I want the buffer to be spawned
  
However, I am puzzled by how I can do the same with consult-grep. 
 I&#x27;ve tried:
  (use-package embark-consult :ensure t :hook (embark-collect-mode . consult-preview-at-point-mode) :config (define-key embark-consult-search-map (kbd &quot;w&quot;) (my/embark-ace-action embark-export))) 
 but 
  
This wouldn&#x27;t work anyway, as embark-export spawns its own buffer; the way that my/embark-ace-action is set up is that it spawns ace-window to switch to the buffer we want (e.g. by creating a split), and then running the command (in this case this would be embark-export)
 For some reason I get dired opened instead of the grep results?
  
Any pointers on how I can accomplish this?
 I see there&#x27;s a variable embark-targets or something like that, which stores the results. Is there a way to render the grep results in the same buffer instead of spawning a new one?
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m trying to get code folding to play nice with treesit auto. The closest package I could find was ts-fold: https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold
 But it seems to expect the external tresitter package instead? When I try to enable it in a python-ts-mode buffer I get: tree-sitter--setup: No language registered for major mode ‘python-ts-mode’
 Any advice?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out how to transform this text:
 Parameter Default Description &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; timezone (required) Timezone (from /usr/share/zoneinfo) to use for date conversions instrument_files (required) List of @c instrument-*.json files to be used for defining instruments 
  
 ...into this:
 Parameter Default Description &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; timezone (required) Timezone (from /usr/share/zoneinfo) to use for date conversions instrument_files (required) List of @c instrument-*.json files to be used for defining instruments 
  
 In other words, a kind of (fill-paragraph) that operates only within two columns (in this case columns 40-75), or alternatively, within a rectangular region. But in any case leaving the rest of the text unchanged. I would be happy to do this on a line-by-line basis, and it feels like this wants to be some incantation of (fill-paragraph), but I haven&#x27;t been able to crack it.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>I love monads and LC, so the Haskell logo feels like the perfect combo of both, It’s been 5 years since I started using FP languages, and I even work with them now. I’m seriously thinking about getting the logo as a tattoo, but I’m a little bit ignorant about trademark stuff. Can I just go for it, or do I need to check the rules in different parts of the world first?
 I&#x27;m kinda ignorant when it comes to laws and stuff, lol.

                              <span>I am looking for an Emacs theme that distinguishes different types of texts well. For example, I would like the following types of the texts all in different colors, including the main-text, bullet points/lists, quotes, headers (and different levels of headers), italics, bolded texts, etc. 
 The result might be too colorful, but I guess I would like to go toward that direction. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hello, Emacs newbie here...
 I&#x27;m trying to add a refile target where title is not a URL. So I added the following line to my configuration:
 (setq org-refile-targets &#x60;((&quot;some-refile.org&quot; :regexp . ,(rx bol (+ &quot;*&quot;) &quot; &quot; (not &quot;[&quot;))))) 
 Everything is good so far, but when I do a org-refile I expect file names to be in the following format: header (file-name.org) and that is the case for other targets where I use :maxlevel but for the target that I use :regexp file name is missing, and it is displayed in following format heading...
 I don&#x27;t know if this is the expected behavior or not, so I thought I might just ask...

 I have a decent understanding of FP.
 I wanted to learn more about effect systems cats, cats-effects, zio.
 I know there&#x27;s no right answers. But which one would you suggest?
 cats and cats-effect?
 zio?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I have been wondering about the proportion of people who use effect systems (cats-effect, zio, etc...) compared to those who use standard Scala (the Martin Odersky way). 
 I was surprised when I saw this post:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/lfbjcf/does_anyone_here_intentionally_use_scala_without/
 A lot of people are not using effect system in their jobs it seems.
 For sure the trend in the Scala community is pure FP, hence effect systems.
 I understand it can be the differentiation point over Kotlin to have true FP, I mean in a more Haskell way.
 Don&#x27;t get me wrong I think standard Scala is 100% true FP. 
 That said, when I look for Scala job offers (for instance from https://scalajobs.com), almost all job posts ask for cats, cats-effect or zio.
 I&#x27;m not sure how common are effect systems in the real world.
 What do you guys think?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have configured re-builder to use &#x27;string mode.
  (require &#x27;re-builder) (setq reb-re-syntax &#x27;string) 
 In re-builder, after I finished with my regex, e.g. \(lambda\) (), I use C-c C-w to copy the regexp. But I noticed a message saying the copied regex is \\(lambda\\) (). The \ is escaped, which makes the regex useless in other places in emacs.
 According to https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/re-builder-interactive-regexp-builder, in &#x27;string mode, the output of the re-builder is supposed to be used for other regex search input.
 I wonder what I missed or messed up in my emacs configuration, or I just missed some key stroke.

                              <span>There has been big lag in my python eglot buffer. The behaviour is kind of like the one where emacs takes seconds to do GC - emacs freezes and you input appears after the freeze(or if you are moving around, cursor jumped to the direction), only that emacs is not doing GC. (I turned on gcmh-verbose, which prints gc message if you have gcmh-mode enabled, to check)
 I run profiler just now and out of 3 runs one of them have 80% CPU time on eldoc. Other 2 0%. I disabled eldoc-mode and suddenly it is as smooth as fundamental-mode.
 It is wierd that it didn&#x27;t appear on other 2 profiler runs. So if you have eglot lag issue you can try this. I have the following doomemacs keymap to help quickly toggle eldoc-mode
  (map! :map doom-leader-map &quot;t e&quot; #&#x27;eldoc-mode )

                              <span>local-key-set seems to set a keybind local to the buffer, regardless of which mode it is in. Keys defined with keymap-local-set upon entering a buffer aren&#x27;t available if you switch modes. Did something replace this functionality or was it removed? I doubt local-key-set will ever get removed, but if there is a non-legacy function that does this I would like to use it.

                              <span>Hi folks, I need sone advice on best practices related to DB calls. I’ve a project, where I run MySQL queries with simple JDBC, writing every statement manually, and using the java PreparedStatement and ResultSet Now, each statement can have 3 possibilities. One, it returns one or more rows, Two, it returns 0 rows Three, it crashes due to a database error
 In FP world, we ideally wrap SQL statements with Try, but how to handle 3 possibilities ? Should I create a monad with 3 possible states, or use Try[Option] to wrap the ResultSet, or just follow plain java and throw the exception in the DAO layer itself ?

                              <span>Disclaimer, I have only been writing Scala for a few months.
 I&#x27;m still learning my way figuring out what breaks syntax. If you look at the snippet below, &#x60;Try&#x60; has to be on its line. &#x60;: db &#x3D;&gt;&#x60; has to end the line. &#x60;toEither&#x60; is inline with &#x60;result&#x60;.
 I saw a recent Odersky quote where he says we should all move to braceless syntax, but I can&#x27;t help but feel it&#x27;s not quite there yet. I have to adjust my whitespace and newlines more often than expected such that it breaks my flow.
 Typically, in Go or Typescript, I can write super messy code, then a fmt command aligns every for me.
 val result &#x3D; Try: dbClient.transaction: db &#x3D;&gt; db.run(query) .toEither

                              <span>Hello All,
As someone with ADHD, the idea of a system that can organize a maelstrom of ideas into something retrievable is irresistible. (I imagine many can relate.) But every attempt, over decades, from pen and paper to Obsidian to Notion, has ended in a mess that becomes unusable. Once the system gets bloated, I start over with the best intentions, trying to keep things simple. I&#x27;ve lost countless hours in this cycle and hope to figure out where I&#x27;m going wrong before I start again.
I have thousands of ideas, thoughts, journal entries, research, etc.
I have various ways to jot things down quickly, but if I don&#x27;t categorize them, I know I’ll never look at them again, especially long journal entries. I used to record notes, which are automatically transcribed, but now I have hundreds or even thousands of transcriptions that are effectively meaningless. I don’t know what I’ll do with them, so they just pile up, collecting, not connecting.
If I try to organize them, that creates friction, and after a valiant effort, things get out of hand. There are too many notes and too many ways to link them, and many are just the same idea phrased differently.
Even with proper linkages, at some point, 200 notes on a topic become clutter, and there’s no way to distill it when I need it.
Sometimes I feel like all this effort to manually do what my brain cannot is futile. If I’m writing something and want to reference a topic, I get overwhelmed by too much information.
Should I stop trying, or is there a method that can help someone like me?
I was excited about AI in Obsidian or Notion, but the results were inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., “show me all my notes on a topic” or “how many notes do I have?” give partial results). Maybe I didn’t set it up correctly, but figuring it out was too overwhelming.
Best,
R</span>

 So I come here to seek guidance from scala experts who are more in touch with the current happenings than I am:)

                              <span>UPDATE:
 [reddit comment](Some searching indicates it may have arrived in Emacs 29 - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/122hw51/how_to_make_customthemesetfaces_work_i_used_it_to/jfzqi75/.)
 I am still on 28
 Mastering Emacs
  
New hooks &#x27;enable-theme-functions&#x27; and &#x27;disable-theme-functions&#x27;. These are run after enabling and disabling a theme, respectively.
  
 I want to try out some new themes but need to ensure that some of my org-todo-keyword-faces settings and a whole load of other faces are compatible with them?
 Questions like suggest there is a _pent-up_demand for such a feature:
 Does emacs have a hook for when the theme changes?
 Is there a universal &#x27;after-theme-load&#x27; hook?
 This manual page A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading suggests something like that may be in the offing and it seems Modus themes come with such a function.
 It is Prot&#x27;s EF themes I want to try out so they might include such a hook.
 PS. Isn&#x27;t the hook example there the kind being deprecated?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve switched on MacOS x86 from
 https://emacsformacosx.com/ https://github.com/caldwell/build-emacs
 to
 https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds/releases/tag/Emacs-29.4 https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds
 The performance of the latter has been excellent and it&#x27;s not just Andrea Corallo&#x27;s magic native jit (unsupported in the caldwell builds). The misbehaviors I was experiencing/suffering from of the former do not seem apparent. This is despite ostensibly sharing the same GNU Emacs code base (independent of patches Jim applies which seem unrelated to my issues).
 For anyone suffering from Emacs performance issues or issues that appear to be bugs, I recommend giving Jim Myhrberg&#x27;s aka u/jimehgeek builds a try. Up next: Emacs 30 testing and ARM.
 Many thanks to both David and Jim for supporting the Emacs community with their Mac builds.

                              <span>I often have to insert special characters into a buffer and I find the default emacs bindings unconvenient and hard to remeber. Thus, I created this function in my init.el which offers an easier way to select a accented character to insert:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; emacs-lisp (defun accented () (interactive) (let ((char-option (completing-read &quot;-&gt; &quot; &#x27;(&quot;A&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;S&quot;))))
 (let ((my-char-list (cond ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;A&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;á&quot; &quot;Á&quot; &quot;à&quot; &quot;À&quot; &quot;â&quot; &quot;Â&quot; &quot;ä&quot; &quot;Ä&quot; &quot;ã&quot; &quot;Ã&quot; &quot;å&quot; &quot;Å&quot; &quot;æ&quot; &quot;Æ&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;E&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;é&quot; &quot;É&quot; &quot;è&quot; &quot;È&quot; &quot;ê&quot; &quot;Ê&quot; &quot;ë&quot; &quot;Ë&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;I&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;í&quot; &quot;Í&quot; &quot;ì&quot; &quot;Ì&quot; &quot;î&quot; &quot;Î&quot; &quot;ï&quot; &quot;Ï&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;O&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ó&quot; &quot;Ó&quot; &quot;ò&quot; &quot;Ò&quot; &quot;ô&quot; &quot;Ô&quot; &quot;ö&quot; &quot;Ö&quot; &quot;õ&quot; &quot;Õ&quot; &quot;ø&quot; &quot;Ø&quot; &quot;œ&quot; &quot;Œ&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;U&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ü&quot; &quot;Ü&quot; &quot;ù&quot; &quot;Ù&quot; &quot;ú&quot; &quot;Ú&quot; &quot;û&quot; &quot;Û&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;C&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ç&quot; &quot;Ç&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;N&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ñ&quot; &quot;Ñ&quot;)) ((string&#x3D; char-option &quot;S&quot;) &#x27;(&quot;ß&quot;))))) (insert (completing-read &quot;-&gt; &quot; my-char-list))))) 
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-&quot;) #&#x27;accented) &#x60;&#x60;
 This function works and does what i need to do but it feels quite clunky to me; so, as the title says, I&#x27;m asking to the elisp veterans out there: is there a smarter way to do this in elisp?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Neovim, and someone recommended emacs to me. I&#x27;m interested in trying it out, but they mentioned it might not play super nice with windows. How well does it work? Is it stable, do the functions work properly, do packages have compatibility issues, etc.?

                              <span>I&#x27;m contemplating a migration from Visual Studio Code to Emacs, and I wanted to replicate one of my favorite VSCode features: instant preview for lightweight markup languages. As part of this transition, I&#x27;m exploring Org mode as a powerful alternative to Markdown and AsciiDoc.
 To make this transition smoother, I&#x27;ve created a template that provides a portable Emacs Org Mode setup with instant HTML preview and auto-refresh functionality. Here are the key features:
  
Automatic HTML export on save
 Instant preview using Emacs&#x27; built-in eww browser
 Auto-refresh preview on each save
 Automatic package installation (org, htmlize, magit)
 Maximized Emacs window on startup
  
The entire setup is contained in a .dir-locals.el file, making it easy to use in any Org Mode project. Just clone the repo, copy the .dir-locals.el file to your project directory, and you&#x27;re good to go!
 I&#x27;m new to the Emacs ecosystem, so I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or any tips for improvement. Has anyone else created similar setups for transitioning from other editors? What other Emacs features should I explore to enhance my Org Mode experience?

When i need to run some basic C code into my org file( with an src block),windows simply tells me that i can&#x27;t do it,i tried msys as well because i thought i missed some packages about the gcc compiler.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a portable Emacs Org Mode setup that I can store on GitHub and clone to any machine with a fresh Emacs installation. My goal is to replicate a workflow similar to what I used in Visual Studio Code with Markdown files. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m aiming for:
  
Open an .org file on the left and have an &quot;instant view&quot; of the corresponding .html file on the right, automatically updated when I save.
 Use Emacs&#x27; built-in HTML viewer eww in GUI mode for the preview.
 Automatically install any required packages (e.g., impatient-mode) if they&#x27;re not already installed.
 Set up the layout so that only the source .org file (on the left) and the .html preview (on the right) are visible—nothing else.
 Automatically maximize the Emacs window on startup.
 Accomplish all of this using .dir-locals…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have read multiple times that a good way to learn is by reading code.
 Do you have any favorite code to recommend - for any reason? 
 (e.g. good example of some concept, bad examples, or just beautiful code that caught your attention, or possibly helped you learn a concept or a technique)

 for example here is a what I would like to have:
 GET /test HTTP/1.1 custom-header: {{&quot;this is a python generated code&quot;.upper()}} 
 I want to highlight every aspect of the request using my custom font-lock-keywords, which I can do easily, but I want the text inside the {{ }} to be highlighted with python font-lock, which I cannot figure out how to do.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve only just gotten started with Emacs this week though I do have experience using Vim. I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to set my fonts to what I would like but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I&#x27;ve done my best to follow the examples provided by the Doom Emacs setup guide as well as examples from users but I seem to still be getting the syntax wrong.
 Here&#x27;s what I have in my config.el:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font Mono&quot; :size 16 :weight &#x27;semibold) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font&quot; :size 16 :weight &#x27;regular) doom-big-font (font-spec :family &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font Mono&quot; :size 20 :weight &#x27;semibold) ) 
 I don&#x27;t get any errors thrown when I reload but the font doesn&#x27;t seem to change. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong since set-frame-font works so Emacs is detecting system fonts.
 I&#x27;ve tried only doing it without variable pitch font and big font and that didn&#x27;t work. Trying it with the whole thing like &quot;FiraCode Nerd Font Mono-semibold-normal-normal&quot; or changing the weight to :weight semibold-normal-normal hasn&#x27;t worked either.
 I&#x27;m at a loss at this point. Any help would be appreciated.

 I keep having to evaluate my init.el manually every time I start Emacs so my keybindings work. I have no idea what the issue is.
 Relevant part of my config, I hope:

 Also, I didn&#x27;t found something similar for that, so you if you do, share it!
 And one more thing, I am really noob in elisp&#x27;ing)

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve been working with setting up Eglot for development use, and I&#x27;ve gotten it to connect with pylsp. However, there seems to be a problem when trying to get the full documentation of a function. Suppose we have a functions like so:
 foo(bar): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function that does stuff&quot;&quot;&quot; return x 
 When hovering over a use of this function with the point, the minibuffer would say foo(bar) and leave out the documentation in the docstring. I&#x27;ve had one case where the documentation is displayed, but only the first line of a multi-line dosctring. Is this a problem with Eglot, Pylsp, or something else?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying out Nix / Home Manager on Ubuntu and used it to install Emacs. It worked pretty easily, which was great, but I noticed that some weird stuff is happening with my config. E.g. I set the frame position inside of a (when window-system) but that now has no effect on startup. If I eval-buffer it then loads. All the other settings from the config file load, though, and Messages doesn&#x27;t show any errors.
 I also am seeing some weird stuff like if I change the theme in my config and close and open Emacs again, it hasn&#x27;t taken affect. But then after I message around with home-manager switch a but the theme loads, but still no frame position change.
 Anyone know what the issue could be?
 The other weird thing is why I open emacs from the terminal, everything works as expected. This is only when opening using the GNOME desktop icon.
 I also just noticed that GNOME has two icons - Emacs (Client) and Emacs. When I open Emacs it works, but Emacs (Client) still has this issue. But it also looks like Emacs just triggers Emacs (Client) to open...

                              <span>Edit2: solvedsolvedsolvedsolvedsolved
 In every monad tutorial they&#x27;re called clean and elegant, but I am currently dealing with an IO (maybe Hashmap) and every time I want to perform a lookup I have to do it using
 fmap (fmap (lookup &quot;key&quot;)) hashmap
 Im writing a little program that imports a hashmap from JSON and that hashmap then has to constantly be called in my code to check configurations, and I think having to nest fmaps like that is quickly going to make my program completely unreadable, could you imagine having to calculate something using
 5 * (fmap (fmap (lookup &quot;key&quot;)) hashmap) ? My first instinct would be to write a function to perform a double fmap with a given function and value, but that just sounds wrong
 how are you supposed to structure your code to prevent something like this? Is this normal?
 Edit: the solution was a refactor and binding the hashmaps in my main function! Thanks a lot!

 Coming from Neovim, reading documentation went from being a reference to reading a full book to read to understand the package (might be just orgmode).
 How would you recommend getting into the feature-rich packages?

Backend optimizations to further enhance code robustness, modularity, and improve plugin stability.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where rapid updates to the overview file caused synchronization errors with quick notes and marked text.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where the file naming strategy led to frequent re-creation of overview files in Denote mode.
 
Fixed an issue in version 0.3.2 where the overview file failed to synchronize correctly due to improper index file retrieval.
 
 After this period of development, the code for org-zettel-ref-mode has finally become modular and robust. No new features will be introduced before version 0.4. Instead, the focus will be on further componentization of the code and providing more customization options.

Is emacs so usefull to write code in another languages as is to lisp dialects? Thanks for any perception

                              <span>Now that use-package is bundled with Emacs 29.1, I&#x27;d like to know how many of you have converted all your config to use use-package? And how many of you still remain with with-eval-after-load?
 To make the survey interesting and insightful for the community, I&#x27;ve got a few questions for you to answer.
  
Which year did you first use Emacs?
 How many lines of Emacs configuration (init.el, other .el called by init.el, etc.) do you have today?
 Approximately, how many external packages do you install from ELPA/MELPA?
 Do you use with-eval-after-load or use-package or something else like straight.el?
 If you switched from with-eval-after-load to use-package or something else, in which year did you make that switch?
 If you switched from with-eval-after-load to use-package or something else, why did you make the switch?
 If you still use with-eval-after-load, why do you still use it?
 What are the pros and cons of with-eval-after-load in your experience?
 What are the pros and cons of use-package (or another solution) in your experience?

                              <span>I wrote a coupe of short advices to change the behavior of ace-window in the following way: calling ace-window repeatedly cycles through the first aw-dispatch-when-more-than most recently used windows, and then ace-window key jumping behaviour is enabled, when there are more than aw-dispatch-when-more-than window available.
 The code is largely untested with other ace-window features which I rarely use, but I am sharing it below in case somebody wants the same behaviour for window switching.

                              <span>So in Obsidian, I had this &quot;productivity view&quot; where I can view a set of files in a layout. For example, on the left were my to-dos and on the right were upcoming events. I had 6 different files arranged in a layout. Another thing, when I open this workspace, it abandoned other files currently open. Whatever I saved as the workspace is what will appear, so I&#x27;m not looking for something similar to desktop workspaces. Is there a package for that does this for buffers?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
I’m excited to share a project that could be useful for those of you using Raspberry Pi devices in your Zettelkasten workflow. I’ve developed an Ansible playbook that automates the setup of Raspberry Pis, including tools that could enhance your note-taking and text-processing environments.
What’s Included:
Network Configuration: Easily set up Wi-Fi networks, access points, and even USB gadget mode for Raspberry Pi.
Text Processing Tools: Install tools like Pandoc and TexLive, essential for converting notes. There&#x27;s also a role for my Zettel Composer tool.
Emacs Environment: If you work with Emacs, the playbook can build it from source and set up Spacemacs with integrated tmux.
Ancient Greek Texts: For anyone working with classical languages, there’s a setup for Diogenes with Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) data.
Seafile Client and Sync Notifications: You can configure Seafile for seamless syncing of notes across devices and set up sync notifications to stay updated on changes.
If you’ve got a Raspberry Pi or a whole fleet of them, this playbook should help you get everything up and running quickly. It’s especially handy if you like to experiment with different setups or need consistency across multiple devices.
You can find the playbook here.
Enjoy!</span>

 Any ideas as to how I could go about implementing this?

 When I used the C-h k command to check it out, the previous help page didn&#x27;t include the first two key codes with the g. The second paragraph read:
  It is bound to C-M-@, C-M-SPC. 
 rather than the current
  It is bound to g C-M-@, g C-M-SPC, C-M-@, C-M-SPC. 
 The current output.
 Something I did must have triggered it
  
C-M-@ runs the command mark-sexp (found in global-map), which is an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘lisp.el’.
 It is bound to g C-M-@, g C-M-SPC, C-M-@, C-M-SPC.
 (mark-sexp &amp;optional ARG ALLOW-EXTEND)
  
What is the significance of the leading g?
 I also notice it in Doom, but generally not in regular Emacs.

                              <span>I am configuring vanilla Emacs for the first time (v29.4) and it seems as if parts of my init.el file is not being evaluated during startup. The entire init.el is provided below.
 The issue that I am having is that gcmh-modeis not being installed, despite use-package-always-ensure t. Additionally, load-path is not being modified to include my modules sub-directory. Both are confirmed at the bottom of the file.
 It is not obvious to me why that would be the case. Everything works fine when I manually open and evaluate the init.el buffer. Similarly, emacs --debug-init does not reveal any issues.
 Am I missing something obvious here?

                              <span>I am currently in the process of migrating from Notion to Org-Mode. So far, I have done a lot of manual copy and paste and the occasional conversion from CSV to org-tables, which works quite nicely. But now I want to migrate some databases to a list of headings, and have not found a suitable solution to this yet. I was thinking that perhaps a template-based solution might be convenient - I can for example create a template entry in Yasnippet like this:
 * $0 :PROPERTIES: :SOME_PROPERTY: $1 :END: $2 
 With the idea of applying this to the following CSV snippet:
 title,some_property,some_content My Heading,Important,Lorem Ipsum... 
 Now unfortunately yasnippet does not seem to be really suitable for this, since the fields need to be input manually (I don&#x27;t think you can easily pass in the $? parameters as a list?). I am wondering if other template libraries might be more suitable for this task, or if anyone has any other bright ideas.

                              <span>Is there a way to generate c++ function definition from a class function declaration? I wonder someone has already done that with the help of built-in treesit.
 I have look into an old post stating the same ability with semantic mode, which is not very helpful with modern lsp and treesit setup.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nglu7z/autogenerating_a_c_implementation_file_from_its/
 If there is not one out there, I may have to make one myself. I already have a half working version.
 Edit: Since no one is replying me, I made my own implementation in elisp.

                              <span>I use tab-bar in Emacs 30.0.91 (installed with brew on macos, emacs-plus@30). I&#x27;m trying to customize the face of the active tab, to make it stand out more:
 (use-package tab-bar :if (display-graphic-p) :config (set-face-attribute &#x27;tab-bar-tab nil :foreground (doom-color &#x27;yellow)) (tab-bar-mode)) This does not work, however, at least not when starting up Emacs. On startup, the face is not customized for the active tab. But if I eval the code above, the customization takes effect. I have tried placing the face customization code in an :init statement instead of :config, but that did not work. Any ideas how this could be done?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the following C style definition as the default for many years:
 (defconst my-c-style &#x27;(&quot;linux&quot; (c-basic-offset . 4) (c-offsets-alist . ((inextern-lang . 0))) (indent-tabs-mode . nil)) &quot;My C style&quot;) (c-add-style &quot;my-c-style&quot; my-c-style) (setq c-default-style &quot;my-c-style&quot;) 
 After switching to Emacs 29.3, opening a new C file results in the style being applied, except for indent-tabs-mode, which is set to true. I used the Lisp debugger and put a watchpoint on the variable. It is set to nil first when the style is applied, and then immediately to true from the same Lisp function. If I remove the Linux base style then I get nil, as expected. Also, applying the style manually with c-set-style works (i.e., indent-tabs-mode is set to nil).
 Has anyone seen this?

                              <span>Typed lambda calculus extends the untyped lambda calculus by introducing a type system. It’s important to note that, unlike untyped lambda calculus, there are multiple typed lambda calculi, each differentiated by the specific features of the type system used. The exact features of the type system can be chosen with considerable flexibility. In this article, we explore some of the common choices.

                              <span>Hello, as the title suggests, I am a beginner and I am asking for clarification in order to understand more clearly how currying is being used in the following example;
 data Address &#x3D; Address { city :: String, street :: String } deriving Show -- without currying mkIncompleteAddress :: String -&gt; Address mkIncompleteAddress street &#x3D; Address &quot;NYC&quot; street -- with currying mkIncompleteAddress&#x27; :: String -&gt; Address mkIncompleteAddress&#x27; &#x3D; Address &quot;NYC&quot; 
 I would like to understand better what&#x27;s happening &#x27;under the hood&#x27; in the example *without currying*.
 As an aside to support the above point, I continued the depth of the example *without currying* from above by taking *both* the city and the street as input into the function, and using currying for both inputs, as so;
 mkIncompleteAddress2 :: String -&gt; String -&gt; Address mkIncompleteAddress2 &#x3D; Address Prelude&gt; mkIncompleteAddress2 &quot;NYC&quot; &quot;ABC Street&quot; Address {city &#x3D; &quot;NYC&quot;, street &#x3D; &quot;ABC Street&quot;} 
 The idea about what&#x27;s happening in the background still eludes me. I would appreciate clarification as to understand the functionality better.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello, as the title suggests, I am a beginner and I am asking for clarification about a specific detail concerning lambda expressions in Haskell.
 While GHCI allows me to do the following,
 Prelude&gt; (\x y -&gt; x + (\z -&gt; z) y) 100 1 111 
 I am unable to do the following;
 Prelude&gt; (\x -&gt; x + (\y -&gt; y)) 100 1 * Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num (p -&gt; p) (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this) * When checking the inferred type it :: forall p. (Num p, Num (p -&gt; p)) &#x3D;&gt; p 
 As seen above, attempting to run this results in an error (which I can&#x27;t make sense of). I am trying to assign 100 to &#x27;x&#x27;, and 1 to &#x27;y&#x27;. What is preventing 1 from being assigned to &#x27;y&#x27;?
 I was under the impression that currying would allow for first filling in &#x27;x&#x27;, then afterwards, filling in &#x27;y&#x27;. Clearly, my assumption was wrong.
 Thanks in advance

 When moving the cursor over a flycheck error it should display a message and show the global-map keymap.
 When moving the cursor to a character with a flycheck overlay emacs freezes (the cursor doesn&#x27;t move):
 Frozen emacs (the cursore is just before the &#x60;f ;&#x60;
 The message appears briefly and is then replaced with the first line of (which-key-show-keymap &#x27;global-map) and if I press any key emacs unfreezes and displays the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) redisplay--pre-redisplay-functions(t) redisplay_internal\ \(C\ function\)() read-key-sequence-vector(nil nil t nil nil t) read-key() which-key--show-keymap(&quot;global-map&quot; (keymap #^[nil nil keymap ...)) which-key-show-keymap(global-map) funcall-interactively(which-key-show-keymap global-map) test-overlay-cursor(# 46 entered) cursor-sensor--detect() 
 I tested with emacs -Q and I have the same behaviour. If I remove the (which-key ...) part, no bug/freeze appears. It looks like I&#x27;m not supposed to call a function that creates a new buffer.

 #+TODO: QUERY THOUGHT INSIGHT INTERESTING-QUOTE | QUERY-CLEARED THOUGHT-RESOLVED INSIGHT-INTERNALISED
 The keywords can be changed according to needs and they can filtered for view in org-agenda view (t view). You can shorten the keywords also according to your sensibilities. I use Q for queries and questions. Period (.) for thoughts and insights that are my own and double quotes(&quot;&quot;) for quotes of interest. This way, you may make systematic notes to your readings. You get a filtered view and the org file itself in which you take the notes acts as a linear document that takes notes as the readings goes forward. Multiple frames of view are retained. Feel free to ask for any clarifications or critique my post (I am new to reddit, I would like to learn the norms).

                              <span>Using Orgzly-revived, I have some agenda items which describe events that start at a certain time, like meetings or phone calls. I&#x27;d like the notification for the event to occur some time before the event is scheduled, e.g. 30 minutes or an hour beforehand, in the same way that Google Calendar allows me to set the notification time.
 Is this possible? I can&#x27;t find such a setting on the app. Or is there a property I have to set in the Org heading for the event to get this to work (like the SCHEDULED: or DEADLINE: properties)?

Disclaimer: I used Google Translator a lot. Expressions can be strange. I would appreciate your feedback 
This is to help Zettelkasten newbies easily understand how to do Zettelkasten.
How to do Zettelkasten is simple:
Let&#x27;s look at them one by one.
1. Take notes.
Just take a note. Easy, right? When taking notes, write only one piece of knowledge per note. Let&#x27;s take an example.
# 202409260746 Zettelkasten is a toolkit for thinking

Zettelkasten means slip-box in German
and is a note-taking method used by Niklas Luhmann.

He published 50 books and over 600 articles with Zettelkasten.
What makes Zettelkasten so powerful is its ability to link notes
together.

The benefits of using the Zettelkasten method are as follows…</span>

Curious to hear your thoughts about &quot;flashcards&quot;. I recently used them to get over a big hump.
I was trying to learn something specific in programming. It is a huge library, and although I am a fluent programmer (having programmed everyday for the last two decades), I was resisiting this.
What helped me over the hump was a combination of my Zk with Anki, a free flashcard system, which does spaced repetition. I think I now know the library I wanted to master really well: the size is what had been a hinderance and no longer seems to be. I made around 200 cards, and I know them inside out now.
Long term, of course, it is the zettelkasten that will help me with the big picture. But @Sascha or others: have you experimented with Anki and if so how has it worked out?</span>

 I need to prep a Presentation about Bucket Sort and my teacher expects to see an example in Haskell. I&#x27;ve already spent hours searching and just found one really long example on github. Maybe I&#x27;m looking at the wrong places?
 Can anyone tell me where I can find an example code for bucket sort in haskell?

                              <span>Hi...I haven&#x27;t programmed since I was 13, that is to say, I know nothing about programming. I want to learn Haskell as my first language, but it seems that a lot of the resources for it are aimed at people who already program imperatively. Does anyone have advice or resources for someone who knows nothing? Preferably resources that will show how different aspects of Haskell are used within programming...I enjoy thinking abstractly but programming seems so different to the type of thinking I&#x27;m used to. Also, could anyone help me install Haskell? I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get it to function. I&#x27;ve just been trying stuff in the Haskell playground.

 Check out more details here: https://bitnomial.com/jobs#haskell-software-engineer
 We&#x27;re targeting Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, and New York at the moment, but will consider remote candidates within American time-zones.
 We also have a bunch of open source projects: https://github.com/bitnomial
 Tech stack:
  
Haskell (GHC)
 React/Typescript
 PostgreSQL
 Nix
 Nomad
 Terraform
 AWS
  
US Base Salary Range: $150-$225k base salary depending on qualifications + equity options
 This is a wide range because we&#x27;re considering many different candidates with varying skill levels.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m using ligatures.el and I would like to enable all ligatures for every programming language except VHDL, for which &#x60;&lt;&#x3D;&#x60; should look like an arrow instead of &#x60;≤&#x60;.
 I tried the following:
 (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;prog-mode &#x27;( ... &quot;&lt;&#x3D;&quot; ... ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;vhdl-mode &#x27;( ... ... ) ) 
 But the more specific mode doesn&#x27;t override prog-mode, so all ligatures are enabled in any case. I also tried to defining a custom mode like this:
 (define-derived-mode prog-except-vhdl-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook (lambda () (when (and (not (derived-mode-p &#x27;vhdl-mode)) (not (derived-mode-p &#x27;prog-except-vhdl-mode)) ;; otherwise I get an infinite loop ) (prog-except-vhdl-mode) ) ) ) (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;prog-except-vhdl-mode &#x27;(... ...)) (ligature-set-ligatures &#x27;vhdl-mode &#x27;(... &quot;&lt;&#x3D;&quot; ...)) 
 This &quot;works&quot; (I get the ligature in prog mode but not in VHDL) but prog-except-vhdl-mode overrides the file type&#x27;s associated major mode so I lose syntax highlighting for everything except VHDL.
 Is there a way to create a non-exclusive major mode like prog-mode? (ligature-set-ligatures doesn&#x27;t take a minor mode)

                              <span>I have this project that I&#x27;m writing using Netbeans: https://github.com/danilomo/KleinLisp/
 I&#x27;m trying to work on this using Emacs, but I couldn&#x27;t make the LSP work with it. I used the configuration from this tutorial that is linked in the github page of java-lsp package:
 https://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/java-programming-in-emacs/
  
Open emacs, wait for first time execution of init.el
 Open project folder, open some file, wait for lsp server be installed
 Emacs suggests adding project folder to workspace, I accept its suggestion and give the project root
 LSP is activated but gives me the following message: &quot;xxx.java is a non-project file, only syntax errors are reported&quot;
  
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do:
  
Tried to open the project in VSCode (found this message in stackoverflow from VSCode users), LSP works with my project
 Created a new gradle project, copied source code to it, LSP works with this gradle project
  
What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;m so confused.
 Edit - found the problem:
 I&#x27;m really unlucky. I put a &quot;.project&quot; folder with some notes in todo org files to be like a &quot;personal mini jira&quot;... Eclipse server needs this path for its &quot;.project&quot; XML file. It&#x27;s so embarrassing lol

                              <span>I use Eglot and clangd. After changing branches in git (using magit) or doing other git operations that update files on disk, I get the following error message when I visit an updated file that has been opened in a buffer, and try to run some Eglot operation on it (like listing references for a member);
 jsonrpc-request: jsonrpc-error: &quot;request id&#x3D;2096 failed:&quot;, (jsonrpc-error-code . -32602), (jsonrpc-error-message . &quot;trying to get AST for non-added document&quot;), (jsonrpc-error-data) 
 The only way to recover from this is restarting Emacs and opening the project up again (using Projectile). Why is this happening, and can I do anything about it?

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently came across emacs, and wanted to give it a go. I installed the most recent version from the main GNU ftp server. However, I somehow managed to install directly onto my desktop folder rather than in program files like every other typical install I would do. Long story short, all my files have disappeared from that folder. Uninstalled emacs assuming I had downloaded a virus but after doing several system checks I can&#x27;t identify anything. I have looked through practically all my files on my pc and local disk storage hasn&#x27;t changed much which seems to tell me they&#x27;re still somewhere? Files are pretty important (don&#x27;t have a full back up) so any help would be appreciated.
 Details:
 I downloaded this file here: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/emacs-29.4-installer.exe
 PC is running windows 10 64 bit.
 Files are a large number of .docx files along with photos (jpg and png mostly) and a bunch of miscellaneous txt files etc.
 Folder/Path I&#x27;m talking about is: This PC &gt; Desktop.

                              <span>Using Emacs 29.4 here. 
 Bibtex-mode knows two dialects, bibtex and biblatex. But the glossaries-extra package in LaTeX and the accompanying bib2gls program support keeping glossaries in bibtex files that should (I think) have their own dialect following the examples in section 7.1 of The bib2gls beginner guide. Has anyone created such a dialect?

Please see the hyperdrive info manual for installation and setup instructions. hyperdrive-org-transclusion augments the org-transclusion package by Noboru Ota by allowing you to transclude hyperdrive content over a network. You can also transclude specific Org document headings by linking to them.
 This package is similar in nature to org-transclusion-http, which also lets you transclude content over the network (HTTP, not hyper).

                              <span>Aim : to filter assigned tasks by assignee to poll for updates.
 I was thinking to do the following: * List of tasks 1. Item 1. Person A. 2. Item 2. Person B. 3. Item 3. Person A. And so on, where person name is a tag. But, tags go to the * ie List of tasks. So that would not work. The other way is write as above and search with C-c s name. Wondering if this is the only way or is there some other mechanism or a smarter way to do it.
 Pointing to the appropriate documentation would be enough. Thanks for your time.

 I need to replace one string with another as follows:
 &quot;abc&quot;-&gt;&quot;klm&quot;; &quot;Abc&quot;-&gt;&quot;Klm&quot;; &quot;ABc&quot;-&gt;&quot;KLm&quot;, etc
 Could you pls. advise if there is a possibility to achieve desired result in one go, e.g. without manual string replacement for each combination?
 Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m experiencing some wierd behaviour with indent-bars-mode. It works flawlessly when called interactively (via M-x or custom key-binding is the same). When called via hook, on the other hand, it activates the mode, but it does not draw the bars, therefore I have to call it manually twice (once to deactivate the mode and a second time to re-activate it); although this gets the bars showing, it completely messes up my syntax highlighting. The -very minimal- configuration that I have used is:
 lisp (use-package indent-bars-mode :ensure t :hook (rust-mode . indent-bars-mode))  am I the only one having this issue? am I doing something wrong?

                              <span>Try M-: (yes-or-no-p &quot;what? &quot;) RET yes RET
 Then check C-x b *Messages* RET. The return value t is shown in the *Messages* buffer:
 t 
 Now try M-: (y-or-n-p &quot;what? &quot;) RET y
 Check C-x b *Messages* RET again. The return value t is shown in the *Messages* buffer. But it is preceded by the prompt string and the answer string too. Like so:
 what? (y or n) y t 
 Why does this difference in behavior exist? Why does y-or-n-p need to print the prompt string and the answer string?
 Source of y-or-n-p where it decides to print the prompt and answer: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/subr.el#L3952 But I don&#x27;t understand why it was written like this to print the prompt and answer?
 This is a problem for me while defining interactive functions. Like so:
 (defun toggle-linum-good () (interactive) (when (yes-or-no-p &quot;toggle line numbers ? &quot;) (display-line-numbers-mode &#x27;toggle))) (defun toggle-linum-bad () (interactive) (when (y-or-n-p &quot;toggle line numbers ? &quot;) (display-line-numbers-mode &#x27;toggle))) 
 Now if I run M-x toggle-linum-good RET, it toggles the line numbers without printing the prompt and my answer once again at the echo area.
 But if I run M-x toggle-linum-bad RET, it toggles the line numbers but after doing that, it prints the prompt and my answer once again to the echo area.
 Why does y-or-n-p need to print the prompt and answer again?

 Version 0.3.2 mainly focuses on backend optimization, reducing the codebase by nearly half, resulting in improved runtime efficiency.
 v0.3.2 (2024-09-24)
 • Improved compatibility with Org-roam v2: it is now possible to update literature notes into the Org-roam database.
 • Minor improvements to file naming.
 • Streamlined and modularized the code.

 I would like to use shackle for managing this, here is my configuration with the part for eshell which does not work

                              <span>I almost exclusively use rust, for web applications and games on the side. I took a look at Haskell and was very interested, and thought it might be worth a try. I was wondering is what I am doing a good application for Haskell? Or should I try to learn it at all?

 What are your thoughts ?

                              <span>Hi all!
I&#x27;ve recently been demoing The Archive app, and one feature I&#x27;ve really come to appreciate is the link-as-search functionality (as opposed to the more common link-as-direct functionality found in other editors). This got me wondering—what other editors have link-as-search?
I searched the forums and found this thread where @Sasha mentioned that Zettlr has link-as-search functionality:

  
One big reason for Zettlr is the link-as-search functionality. This is perhaps the most important feature implementation to make an app software-agnostic.


Zettlr&#x27;s documentation covers link-as-search here.
Additionally, I found a thread on the topic of link-as-search vs link-as-direct
Does anyone know of any other editors with built-in link-as-search functionality?</span>

                              <span>The Python programming language, and its huge ecosystem (there are
more than 500,000 projects hosted on the main Python repository,
PyPI), is used both for software engineering and
scientific research. Both have similar requirements for
reproducibility. But, as we will see, the practices are quite
different.
In fact, the Python ecosystem and community is notorious for the countless ways it uses to declare dependencies.
As we were developping FawltyDeps1,
a tool to ensure that declared dependencies match the actual imports
in the code, we had to accommodate many of these ways.
This got us thinking:
Could FawltyDeps be used
to gain insights into how packaging is done across Python ecosystems?
In this blog post, we look at project structures and dependency declarations across Python projects,…</span>

 Other than the standard hotkey-binding scheme, are there other, alternative, popular ones?

                              <span>Hi everyone! New to emacs here. I needed some help in how emacs is setting up my background color. If I start emacs with just that, it works. But emacsclient still gives the original background color of the theme.
 I&#x27;m using elpaca with use-package integration.
 Here is my config:
  (use-package doom-themes :demand :config (load-theme &#x27;doom-tokyo-night t) (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) &#x27;background-color &quot;#0A0A0A&quot;) (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) &#x27;alpha-background 95) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(alpha-background . 95))) 
 Background transparency works in both of them, however, the colour is set to black in only emacs. How can I fix this? Thanks.

                              <span>I have just switched to 29.3, and the following code, which I have had in my init file for years, no longer binds up/down:
 (add-hook &#x27;eshell-mode-hook &#x27;(lambda () (local-set-key (kbd &quot;C-a&quot;) &#x27;eshell-bol) (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;previous-line) (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;next-line))) 
 I have also tried M-x keymap-local-set, but the  key stays bound to eshell-previous-matching-input-from-input. Curiously, it looks like eshell-mode-map does get updated:
 (keymap (down . next-line) (up . previous-line) (1 . eshell-bol) (27 keymap (12 . eshell-show-output) (13 . eshell-queue-input)) (13 . eshell-send-input) (3 . eshell-command-map)) 
 Any ideas?

How to deal with this?

 I would like something like leap in neovim that allows one to automatically jump to the first match of a 2 character search but if the first match is not the match that the user would like to go to, it shows avy like labels for other matches.

 idk why but Haskell has started to seem attractive (?) to me. i wanted to learn Haskell so i started setting up by installing ut on my laptop. it has been 4 hours and i have yet to complete it as issues after issues arise. latest issue is that after i installed stack seperately (i had first installed just GHCup), i tried installing HLS but failing to do that as well.this is the powershell interaction: 
 PS C:\Users\user\Project Haskell&gt; stack install haskell-language-server &gt;&gt; Warning: No packages found in snapshot which provide a &quot;tasty-discover&quot; executable, which is a build-tool dependency of generic-arbitrary Error: [S-4804] Stack failed to construct a build plan.

                              <span>I came across an analogy someone made about passion years ago that has stuck with me ever since. The analogy is:
You can tell if an Italian chef is still passionate about what they do not through the inspired specials or the amazing cannolis or tiramisu, but all you have to do is look at the red sauce. The red sauce is something they’re supposed to make fresh every day; It’s one of the main fundamentals of being an Italian chef. It’s also something that can easily become the mundane if they’re not careful. It’s in the fundamentals that a dip in passion is shown in.
I’m VERY new to building my network of notes, so I’m curious, would most people put this analogy as a separate note like “Red Sauce Analogy” or would this live in a note for the overall concept titled “When passion slips, it shows in the mundane first”?</span>

                              <span>When I started my ZK in 2018, I adopted the Barbell Method of Reading as my note-taking workflow. I&#x27;ve made only minor tweaks over time. Today, I still adhere to the core idea of reading freely, quickly noting everything that captures my interest, and then revisiting and processing those notes before adding them to my ZK, connecting them with existing ideas.
This is my second processing of @Sascha&#x27;s article. Thank you, Sascha, for the clear coaching on the simple idea of the two stages of note-making that got me going.
Critiques welcome.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for some advice on optimizing a search functionality in Emacs. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to achieve:
  
Search Goal: 
 Use ripgrep (rg) to search through my ~/notes directory.
 Search for multiple words that may appear in any order, across multiple lines within files.
 The search should be case-insensitive and only return file names that contain all the specified words.
 Integrate the search with Helm to have a dynamic, real-time updating interface.
 
  
What I&#x27;ve Tried:
  
Using helm-rg and helm-ag**:**
  
I wrote a custom Emacs function to adjust the search pattern using lookahead assertions, enabling multi-word, any-order searches.
  
Here&#x27;s the Emacs Lisp code I&#x27;ve been using: (defun my-helm-rg-notes-file-names () &quot;Search ~/notes directory for files containing m…</span>

 Emacs EWW (Emacs Web Wowser) is a web browser package for Emacs, allowing users to browse URLs within an Emacs buffer. It provides a simple and lightweight way to access the web from within the Emacs environment. EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen and is now maintained by the GNU Emacs project.
 One of the key features of EWW is its ability to display web pages inline, without requiring an external browser. This is achieved through the use of an HTML renderer, shr.el, which renders HTML pages directly within the Emacs buffer. EWW also supports viewing PDFs inline, using the doc-view-mode, and can be customized using the mailcap mechanism.
 EWW has several unique features that set it apart from other web browsers. It can display images inline, if Emacs was built with image support, and can block specific images completely by customizing shr-blocked-images. Additionally, EWW uses the colors declared in the HTML page, but adjusts them if needed to maintain a certain minimum contrast.
 Users can interact with EWW using a variety of commands, including eww-copy-page-url to copy the URL of the current page into the kill ring, and eww-bookmark-kill to delete bookmarks. EWW also provides a buffer for managing bookmarks, which can be accessed using M-x eww-bookmarks.
 EWW is highly customizable, with many variables and options available for tweaking its behavior. For example, the eww-history-limit variable controls the number of history entries kept, and can be set to nil to allow the history list to grow indefinitely. Additionally, users can customize image display using shr-inhibit-images and shr-blocked-images.
 Overall, Emacs EWW provides a convenient and flexible way to access the web from within Emacs, making it an attractive option for developers and power users who value the integration and customization offered by the Emacs environment.

                              <span>Lispy is a package which combines modal editing with Lisp by turning on modal editing whenever the cursor is near parens. This allows for single keystroke operations, such as e to evaluate an s-expression (which with eros will then show the result inline). It&#x27;s paredit with less keystrokes!
 There hasn&#x27;t been a Lispy release since 2015, and a commit or PR merge for a couple of years. 
 abo-abo, a hero of mine, disappeared from Lispy around the time his child was born. And who can blame him? We&#x27;re happy for him! He deserves the time with family after all he has done for us.
 But many of us depend upon the Lispy package, so I have made a temporary fork here until abo-abo returns: https://github.com/enzuru/lispy
 I have applied the last few important PRs to get Lispy working again. I have tested it successfully on Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, Guile, and Clojure. Let me know if it works for you!

                              <span>Heya!
 I&#x27;m using emacs to keep my journal (notes, tasks, etc) but it&#x27;s really frustrating that I can&#x27;t just carry my macbook with me all the time.
 It&#x27;d be nice to have a tiny (maybe the size of iPad mini) laptop I could reasonably use emacs on (and some coding stuff like lisp/ruby/jvm).
 There&#x27;s a range of GPD devices that seem to fit the profile but they&#x27;re made for gaming and are really pricey. I just want a simple linux machine (I&#x27;d even be ok if it didn&#x27;t have X, years ago I had a netbook running Arch I used without graphics for a year).
 I also found a better priced laptop from Fsjun. Never heard of them before. And apparently, there&#x27;re other similar brands.
 Any recommendations?

                              <span>I have two almost identical Debian Bookworm installations. Linux kernel: 6.1.0-25-amd64, Gnome: 43.9, Emacs: 28.2. Same Emacs packages installed. The only difference is that in machine A I have X11 (since I have NVIDIA Quadro T1000 Mobile graphics card in machine A and the nvidia driver 535 (that comes with Bookworm) does not work well with Wayland) and in machine B I have Wayland (no nvidia card).
 For some reason machine A (with X11) is slow when I type fast. The characters appear in the screen after some lag, which is really annoying. 
 I have tried Emacs profiler in both machines, and the profiler shows pretty much the same in both machines:
 187 66% - command-execute
 187 66% - call-interactively
 187 66% - apply
 187 66% + call-interactively@ido-cr+-record-current-command
 64 22% - linum-update-current
 64 22% - linum-update
 64 22% - linum-update-window
 8 2% display-graphic-p
 25 8% + ...
 6 2% + redisplay_internal (C function)
 The only difference is in the X11 machine: &quot;display-graphic-p&quot;.
 Is there some advice how to debug this lagginess issue?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m uncertain if this is the right place to post this. I originally was going to post here because I was going to ask about the differences in features/usage between org-roam and denote, but I kept thinking about it, and I feel like my overarching question should be about my notetaking strategy in general, which tools are then subordinate to.
 I have been trying GTD recently. I find the idea of the inbox to be really valuable, and I did an initial thoughtdump of every potential open loop I had in my mind. It turned out that a lot of it was less task-oriented and more introspective: things about my future, things about how I should engage with parts of the world, and so forth. The only &quot;next action&quot; I could get for these was to journal about it.
 Now, I&#x27;m attempting to determine how I should organize journal-notes like these. I think extracting parts of my introspective writing into its own note, and linking those notes together would have value to me (I don&#x27;t particularly think I&#x27;d want to duplicate a full-on Zettelkasten system, but parts of it seem useful to pick up). But I don&#x27;t really know. A lot of the systems I&#x27;ve read about are either about explicit actionability (GTD, PARA...) or about synthesizing sources and finding interesting connections (Zettelkasten). Is there anything for structured introspection? does anyone do that, and what does your system look like?

                              <span>Hey folks!
 I just hacked together a clone of Python&#x27;s instructor library and I&#x27;m looking for early feedback. That library makes using LLMs programmatically very convenient and it seems elisp would benefit from that.
 The core of what Instructor does is allow coders to define a class in Python and then to use that class to define the function-calling / JSON structured output of the LLM as well as instantiate that class based on the response of the LLM. So I tried to replicate this with defstructs as I could.
 Here&#x27;s the link to the repo (obviously it&#x27;s called instructor.el). It&#x27;s fewer than 100 lines of code at the moment. https://github.com/Trevoke/instructor.el
 And the basic usage pattern looks like this:
 (setq llm (make-llm-ollama :chat-model &quot;llama3.1&quot;)) ;; for valid types see the help for &#x60;make-llm-function-arg&#x27; and look at the type. (instructor-defstruct dnd-character (name nil :type string :description &quot;The character&#x27;s name&quot;) (class nil :type string :description &quot;The character&#x27;s class&quot;) (race nil :type string :description &quot;The character&#x27;s race in the D&amp;D setting&quot;) (skills nil :type (list string) :description &quot;The skills the character has&quot;)) (instructor-call :llm llm :type &#x27;dnd-character :prompt &quot;Make a starter character for D&amp;D 5th edition.&quot;) ;; (#s(dnd-character :name &quot;Eilif Stonefist&quot; :class &quot;Fighter&quot; :race &quot;Human&quot; :skills ;; [&quot;Acrobatics&quot; &quot;Athletics&quot;]))

                              <span>I don&#x27;t use emacs for programming, I use orgmode as an outliner a lot and for some task management. I want to integrate PDF and epub highlights into my notes, so I tried to install the org-noter package on my emacs 29.4.
 I mindlessly copied the following from the github page to my ~/.emacs file:
 (use-package org-noter
 :load-path &quot;
&quot;
 :ensure t
 :demand t)
 It returned the error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install org-noter: https://melpa.org/packages/org-noter-20240509.1756.tar: Not found
 Error (use-package): Cannot load org-noter
 I tried M-x package-install and got a similar error:
 Contacting host: melpa.org:443
 package--with-response-buffer-1: https://melpa.org/packages/org-noter-20240509.1756.tar: Not found
 Then, I actually read the lines, and it seems like it&#x27;s expecting me to tell it a directory? I don&#x27;t want to download and manually install the package, I want it to update automatically, but I don&#x27;t see how to do that. I&#x27;ve already installed the which-key package with use package, without providing a directory, with:
 (use-package which-key
 :init (which-key-mode)
 :diminish which-key-mode
 :config
 (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5))

                              <span>TL;DR
Hello everyone!
This is my first post on the forum and I think it is due, as I have not been able to find an answer.
This current college year I started doing my zk on Obsidian and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful!
I know that each app is different and that it&#x27;s better for me to adapt to those apps instead of looking for one that is perfect for my needs. 
Yesterday I found Sublimeless Zettelkasten by @rene. It really meets all my needs, it&#x27;s amazing!
However I have never used IDs for my notes, but used the title directly; so all the links in my notes are like this: [[note-title]]. I know that Sublimeless ZK works with IDs so I added to all my notes an ID before the file name according to their creation date so that I could see them in the application.
The problem is in the links inside the notes (those I don&#x27;t plan to change because they are exaggeratedly too many xd).
I already read the README on GitHub of the application, but I understand little or almost no code, so my question is: 
An apology if the question is very naive but I really loved Rene&#x27;s app and would love to use it as soon as possible with my existing notes.
Best regards and thanks for reading,

 That paper was quoted by Erik Meijer in FP101x several years ago.
 Do you happen to know the title of such paper or where to find it these days?
 There is only one piece of information about it In the forum thread in which the paper was quoted.
  
It is especially remarkable since, in the Haskell community, monads are still considered as one of the most advanced and difficult features to master
  
Thanks a lot! 
 Please do have a nice day.

                              <span>So I watched this Tsoding Video on JSON parsing in Haskell. I have studied that video over and over trying to understand why exactly is a certain abstraction he uses so useful and refactorable. Implementing interfaces/typeclasses for some types for certain transformations to be applicable on those types and then getting these other auto-derived transformations for the type so seamlessly is mind-blowing. And then the main recipe is this whole abstraction for the parser itself which is wrapped in generic parser type that as I understand allows for seamless composition and maybe... better semantic meaning or something?
 Now the problem is though I understand at least some of the design abstractions for this specific problem (and still learning functions like *&gt; and &lt;* which still trip me), I dont get how to scale this skill to spot these clever abstractions in other problems and especially how to use typeclasses. Is the average Haskeller expected to understand this stuff easily and implement from scratch on his own or do they just follow these design principles put in place by legendary white paper author programmers without giving much thought? I wanna know if im just too dumb for haskell lol. And give me resources/books for learning. Thanks.

Read free online: https://leanpub.com/haskell-cookbook/read Note: I used Alexander Thiemann&#x27;s unofficial OpenAI Haskell client code, discarding my own older OpenAI client code.
 I also added added more text explaining code examples, fixed many typo and other small corrections.
 I hope you enjoy it!

                              <span>I had a hard time understanding Scala 3 metaprogramming, so I kept searching the internet for articles. Finally, I came across one that helped me understand what Scala metaprogramming is and how it ensures type safety at compile time.
 The article is called “Inline your boilerplate – harnessing Scala 3 metaprogramming without macros.” Even though it’s a bit old and doesn’t have fully working code, after studying with ChatGPT for a week based on the content, I was able to grasp the concept of Scala metaprogramming.
 It seems like many people are looking for resources on Scala 3 metaprogramming, and I believe reading the article I shared will be very helpful for you as well.
 I also completed the code based on the blog post and created a Gist I hope this will be helpful to anyone who needs it.

                              <span>Hi, this is something I have been struggling with for a while. Every now and then I accidentally rebind a key that I didn&#x27;t want to rebind. I could not figure out how to &quot;undo&quot; that. In some cases, if it is a simple command and I know which command it was before, I guess I can rebind it (although sometimes this is hard if it only applies to particular modes).
 But it just so happens that I now accidentally rebound C-h and I have no clue on how to fix that (other than completely restarting emacs, which does not seem like a very elegant and satisfying solution).
 Is there a way to &quot;restore&quot; a keybinding to its default state? Or (next best option) a way to &quot;save&quot; my keybindings, so I can restore from a restore-point?
 For now, I guess I will have to restart emacs (again....) which is always a bummer if you have 100 open buffers and a bunch of tabs with stuff you are working on.

                              <span>Hello everyone ! 
 This is my first time posting here to get some help from you ! :)
 As the title say, i&#x27;m a main vim user for the past year. But, for any reason, I wanted to try emacs (with evil mode of course aha). 
 I&#x27;m still a bit confused with some keybinding, not because of evil mode or emacs, but because i&#x27;m on a Mac. 
 So, the fact is that I mainly program in C. I see that there is something called lsp-mode here :
 https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/
 The installation process is really smooth and i&#x27;m now using a super duper cool looking IDE ! But here&#x27;s lay my problem :
 On the website, there is a lot of keybinding like this :
 s-l r r
 But even with this on my fresh init.el file :
 (setq mac-command-modifier &#x27;super)
 I cannot do &quot;super key&quot; command. Do you have any advice to help me ? :)
 (also, I you have any tips with evil mode, or with emacs itself, please don&#x27;t hesitate and tell them to me!)

                              <span>Novice emacs user here. I&#x27;m slowly starting to use org mode for TODOs, capturing fleeting ideas/ thoughts and structuring my notes.
 One thing that I&#x27;m struggling with is using the agenda functionality. I really like the idea of using it to get an overview of my events/ scheduled items, and I do schedule things, but I keep forgetting to actually look at the agenda view. I know that this is 90% a me problem, but I was wondering what the best solutions for this is, either packages or some custom elisp (although I don&#x27;t really know how write elisp yet).
 I would like the agenda to be a little bit &quot;in my face&quot;, in terms of making me remember to look at it, and it would also be nice to have some sort of reminder, notification or alert when there are events/ scheduled items in the next X days.
 If you have any suggestions, ideas for how to build a better workflow or just pointers to some resources, I would be very grateful.

                              <span>Hi all!
 This release has been in development for a while. Some eye candy there, but mostly it&#x27;s updated for the behavior basics and the backend protocol (e.g. full parity with completion-at-point-functions and adding some extras on top while staying mostly backward compatible with the original company-mode backends).
 Completion in the middle of a symbol, general &quot;expand common&quot; behavior, more consistent and powerful &quot;backend grouping&quot;, better rendering for the completions popup and support for completion-styles in more built-in backends.
 See detailed changes here: https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/blob/master/NEWS.md#2024-09-21-100

                              <span>Not a Haskell-specific question, but I was wondering if anyone can point me at any resources to read about the background on subtyping and type variance. I&#x27;m vaguely familiar with the notion of (co|contra|in|bi)variant relation. The examples I&#x27;ve seen, however, felt very specific and naive. That gives me a rough idea, but am interested in knowing more on the theory (I must add, &quot;if I can&quot;, as the the literature on types and category theory often terrifies me).

                              <span>Hi! I shared one of my Zettels and a query around it 2 weeks ago and I received some feedback that forced me to reflect on some fundamental questions.
The most pressing of which is - what exactly constitutes evidence?
Zettelkasten is a way to express my thought process, so if my thought and reasoning processes are flawed then I will end up with subpar knowledge. Requesting you all to lend your guidance and help me reach a deeper level of understanding.
Adding some more context to the situation -
In one of my notes, I made a claim that growth follows certain principles. One of which is accumulation - that repetitions of a task add competence (see attached note) 
Now - this is based on simple observations such as regularly practicing a new language will add on proficiency, regularly working …</span>

 I don&#x27;t have evil-collection to keep things minimized.
 But what I&#x27;ve been noticing is that when I run the following, there is a side-effect of dired-sidebar closing.
 M-x dired-sidebar-toggle-sidebar ;; dired-sidebar opens in the left of my window M-x evil-window-right ;; focus the buffer on the right side of dired-sidebar M-x evil-window-split ;; split horizontally so two buffers top and bottom M-x evil-quit (or M-x evil-window-delete) ;; delete the buffer I&#x27;m working on 
 I notice that both the buffer where the evil-quit/evil-window-delete was ran in, and the dired-sidebar buffer closing. Has anyone run into this issue?

                              <span>Is it possible to make eglot handle completions within an inferior-ess-r-mode? Most of my work I do in orgmode and I wanted to start eglot when opening org-babel-switch-to-session-with-code, which in my understanding opens an inferior-ess-r-mode. Now, this inferior mode is not associated with a file on disk, which makes it impossible to run the eglot lsp backend? 
 Is there a way to circumvent this?
 My eglot config starts with:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package eglot ;; no :ensure t here because it&#x27;s built-in :defer t ;; Configure hooks to automatically turn-on eglot for selected modes
 :hook ((org-mode . eglot) (ess-r-mode . eglot) (ess-mode . eglot)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hey there!
 I wrote an Emacs package for note taking (Zettelkasten). It is similar to u/protesilaos &#x27;s wonderful Denote, but a whole lot simpler.
 I found out about his package when I&#x27;d finished writing mine and, even though it&#x27;s simpler, I thought someone might find it useful. At least, I use it intensely :D
 You can take a look at https://github.com/villarragut/org-zk
 Also, here&#x27;s a screenshot:

                              <span>Hello,
 I developed a super-hint.el for emacs: https://github.com/eval-exec/super-hint.el
 I add a descriptino video in the github repo&#x27;s READMD.md.
 It can show which-function as hint for rg&#x27;s result buffer, or xref&#x27;s result buffer, like this:
 The bottom left provides a hint from super-hint, guiding you to understand the context of the line
 If you find super-hint.el helpful, please give it a star.
 Do you have any ideas or suggestions to improve super-hint.el?
 Thank you. 💙

                              <span>Hey all , recently I started as a Junior Scala developer using Scala and play , and wanted to know about everyone&#x27;s thoughts on Scala , particularly relating to the job market in the UK. 
 Is it worth going deep into and how fun is it ? 
 Any resources would also be greatly appreciated.
 P.S this is my first coding role

 Explore the compile-time arsenal that Scala 3 gives us without resorting to dirty tricks. (You may know them as macros ;)).
 I shouldn&#x27;t have to know what kind of syntax tree a constructor call desugars into, I just want to transform between two extremely similar data types because the Internet told me I should separate my domain models into layers before I shove them between curly brackets on a socket somewhere.
 Are these the kind of thoughts you entertain on a daily basis?
 See, you actually CAN have the latter without the former in Scala 3 with no loss to your compile-time comfort zone, so kiss your ASTs goodbye - we won&#x27;t be seeing them again. 
 With that in mind, you can strap in for a gauntlet style run through match types, mirrors, typeclass derivation and the new, exciting and experimental named tuples to build a micro-library that does one-liner conversions between similarly shaped data types with some live demos where we desperately try to make the compiler really mad at us sprinkled in.

                              <span>A while ago - perhaps a months ago - in this subreddit I came across a post mentioning a build tool(?) like Bazel that it can build different languages, the build syntax is like yaml, and it also integrates function for building docker IIRC. 
 I am sure it&#x27;s not mill, sbt. However, I tried searching again here with the keywords like build tool, docker, yaml, and so on but I no longer am able to find it now. Scrolling through the post does find related posts either.
 Anyone has read something like that? Many thanks.

                              <span>Hi all. I recently released Orgro 1.40.4 with probably the most-requested features since it launched ~4.5 years ago:
  
Full-text editing support: enter a separate editor view to freely edit the plain markup. Works on narrowed sections as well. [demo]
 id: link resolution across files. This has been most requested by Org-roam users. Requires directory permissions per the FAQ. [demo]
  
I&#x27;ve added lots of other improvements as well; see the changelog for details.
 Full-text editing is all well and good, but I&#x27;m still thinking about other kinds of &quot;structured&quot; editing operations and how they can be exposed comfortably in a mobile UI (especially one that tries to mimic the &quot;native&quot; appearance of an Org Mode doc in Emacs). If you have ideas, suggestions, or other feedback, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

 Is it just me or &quot;#&quot; breaks the search in Consult? Both in grep and find file functions, I consistently can&#x27;t get any results. 
 Every time I open consult-find or consult-ripgrep, I have to delete the # character first;

 My consult config:
 (use-package consult :config (setq consult-ripgrep-command &quot;rg --null --line-buffered --color&#x3D;ansi --max-columns&#x3D;500 --no-heading --line-number . -e ARG OPTS&quot;) (setq xref-show-xrefs-function #&#x27;consult-xref xref-show-definitions-function #&#x27;consult-xref)) 
 Any ideas what am I doing wrong?

I just created it to save myself time while writing graphics code; maybe you&#x27;ll like it too. It&#x27;s not on MELPA or anything yet. It&#x27;s also the first public package I&#x27;ve ever created, despite being an Emacs user since around 1982. Comments/questions/PRs gratefully accepted of course!

 I have a project that has a number of nested submodules. I didn&#x27;t structure it this way, it&#x27;s something provided to me. In any event I think I have all the submodules fetched, however I&#x27;m getting a strange reaction from magit on this last one I know about.
 In this directory, at the command line if I issue git status it comes back with information about the version controlled module. It&#x27;s in a detached HEAD state, but that&#x27;s alright for the moment. Basically it reports just fine.
 If I am in magit, and I start at the top, and then open submodules on the way down, when I get to this submodule it says &quot;Corrupt Git configuration&quot;. I find this puzzling since Git status seems to work.
 Any ideas on what is going on here? It&#x27;s an awfully short error message that doesn&#x27;t really let me know what the corruption is about (and there&#x27;s nothing further in Messages to explain further.)

 It precisely means that the command has to: 
 &quot;Close the frame without ask for confirmation unless it is the last frame opened and there are unsaved buffers&quot;
 That&#x27;s the statement that describes the command. 
 Can someone help me? I&#x27;m new in Emacs. 
 Thank you in advance :)

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m a student using i3wm on Arch Linux, and I’m struggling to decide between Neovim and Emacs as my main text editor. I really don’t have much time to keep switching between editors, so I’m looking for something I can stick with long-term.
 Here’s some context:
  
I type at around 150 WPM, so I want something fast and efficient.
 I’ve been using both Neovim and Emacs for about two months, and I’m comfortable with the keybindings of both.
 I like Neovim because it feels simpler and more straightforward, which is great since I’m learning a lot of new things (programming, using i3wm, etc.).
 However, Emacs is appealing because it seems to be this all-in-one tool where you can do everything from text editing to managing your entire workflow. Plus, I have to admit, using Emacs makes me feel a bit superior, like it’s a “power user” tool, which makes my decision even harder.
  
One important thing: I also want to focus on building actual projects rather than spending too much time customizing my editor. Neovim feels more minimal, which might help me stay focused, but at the same time, I wonder if I’d be missing out on something Emacs offers, like Org mode for note-taking, which I’ve heard is amazing.
 Ultimately, I want to commit to one text editor for life. I don’t want to spend months switching between them or tweaking configurations. My goal is to focus on programming, taking notes, and building real projects—without getting too distracted by endlessly customizing my editor.
 So, should I stick with Neovim and its simplicity, or is it worth diving into Emacs for its extra features and potential? I’d really appreciate your advice, especially from anyone who’s been in a similar position.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>I installed emacs and it is version 31.0.50. I am following this guide https://medium.com/swlh/installing-and-configuring-emacs-development-on-linux-378414a06bbc . But for me I see no emacs folder in the .config directory. No init.el and early-init.el file either. Can you suggest where to add the init.el file?

                              <span>This is not a Homework question.
 I am a current university student and asked to set up environment for programming course, steps are shown below (Picture 1 ), it was said that there was a problem with HLS in the process. After doing all the stuff I found that visual studio code keep telling me to install ghcup, so I used the order &quot;Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol &#x3D; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; try { &amp; ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/sh/bootstrap-haskell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing))) -Interactive -DisableCurl } catch { Write-Error $_ }&quot; in powershell to install ghcup, and then it says that ghcup was failed to install (Picture2).

 I&#x27;ve also tried to install ghcup using the terminal, but things did also go wrong

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;d like to share my library for reading and writing Parquet files—ZIO Apache Parquet—which perfectly fits the ZIO ecosystem. It is built around ZIO Schema&#x27;s codec derivation mechanism. As a nice bonus, the filter predicates are type-safe.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a beginner fper and I&#x27;ve chosen scala because of jvm ecosystem. My background is python, JavaScript web stacks and a little bit of java in android development. I started learning scala a few months back using the following resources: Alvin Alexander&#x27;s fp simplified 2e ( Waiting eagerly for it to be completed :( ), Functional programming in scala 2e, Scala with cats, Essential effects. While those were great books, I still don&#x27;t feel confident about writing entire projects in fp scala. My end goal is to shift my algo trading system to scala, (from python) to take advantage of parallelism and spark. Are there any resources (books preferably) which teach, in a practical way, to write a server or a web api or any large project in a functional way? For beginner fper. Most of the videos on YT assume a high working knowledge of fp in scala already. I can write things in oop way in scala (tranlating code from python), however I would love to learn functional style. I know there are rockthejvm courses, but thats wayyy too expensive for me, since I&#x27;m not looking to use scala professionally, (I&#x27;m self employed) Thanks

                              <span>v0.4.0 of hyperdrive.el is available on NonGNU ELPA!
 hyperdrive.el is an Emacs interface to hyperdrive, a mutable, versioned, peer-to-peer shared filesystem. Among other things, hyperdrive.el has these features: Share unlimited files of unlimited size; Explore file history with built-in versioning; Stream video and audio; No signup or account creation; Free as in Freedom!
 Highlights of v0.4.0:
  
 Transclude hyperdrive content using org-transclusion (until hyperdrive-org-transclusion is available on NonGNU ELPA, please use package-vc-install).
  Easier installation of the external gateway program dependency with M-x hyperdrive-install.
  Save disk space by &quot;forgetting&quot; your copy of a file with M-x hyperdrive-forget-file.
  Security measures added to avoid loading major modes in potential unsafe buffers (hyperdrive-mark-as-safe).
  Improved, asynchronous interface for starting and stopping the gateway.
  See at a glance which files have been already downloaded based on their faces in the directory and history buffers.

                              <span>indent-bars: fast, configurable indentation guide-bars
 ➤ v0.7.4, now on ELPA!
 Since the last update a year ago, indent-bars has improved substantially. New capabilities:
  
Bar depth can be held fixed in parenthesized expressions (e.g. long function calls) and multi-line strings.
 tree-sitter support — with tree-sitter&#x27;s help, indent-bars can do more: 
 scope-focus: emphasize the current scope (e.g. function, if block, etc.),
 omit blank-line bar display in certain contexts (e.g. top-level module),
 and more.
 
 Fully configurable styling (colors by-depth, bar width, pattern, more) for both in-scope and out-of-scope bars.
 Auto-updating theme support.
 3 methods for depth selection for highlighting the bar at the current depth, including a new default.
 Immediate feedback when changing bar setting in the Customize interface.
 Support for lots of new languages.
 When showing the same buffer side-by-side, stipple bars are displayed correctly in each window.

                              <span>Last week I ditched Doom Emacs for Emacs Bedrock, and from there I carve my Emacs configuration to fit my taste and needs on another file that is loaded at the end of &#x60;init.el&#x60;.
 At first, I decided to install projectile because it appeared that project management was lacking in Emacs, and it didn&#x27;t come installed by Bedrock; however, I discovered that Emacs actually provides a built-in alternative to projectile called &#x60;project.el&#x60;. I implemented some enhancements that someone else kindly shared on the web.
 However, I noticed that there is no customization or command for discovering projects recursively. In project.el project discovery is something 100% manual, the user has to do. Thus, I wonder if someone else has already solved this problem and could share emacs-lisp snippets, maybe? :)

In the pdf file generated from org-mode, the spacing between paragraphs is the same as the spacing between lines.
 My question is: how to make the spacing slightly wider in the pdf generated from org-mode? I prefer not to manually set a number but to use a package or some other way? Thank you!

                              <span>I use yadm to manage my dotfiles. It works by setting up a bare git repo in ~/.local/share/yadm/repo.git, so the dotfiles themselves are not in a traditional git repo. (That&#x27;s nice because otherwise git would try to manage all of $HOME.) 
 I use built-in project.el, not projectile. I&#x27;m running a recent self-built emacs off master.
 When I edit my .bashrc, I use eglot with a bash lsp server. Eglot (or something called from it, maybe in project.el?) thinks everything in $HOME should be managed by this server, and runs a giant find . command, which eventually times out and restarts the LSP server endlessly.
 A possible solution to this is to tell emacs that my dotfiles are in an opt-in project that only contains those dotfiles, nothing else. (I&#x27;d rather not have to put all my other dirs under ~ into some ignore list -- that&#x27;s why yadm is so nice, because it&#x27;s opt-in, not opt-out.) If I could teach emacs that the dotfiles are backed by the actual bare git repo, that would be even nicer, but mostly I just want to avoid eglot trying to manage my whole home dir.
 Any advice? Anyone tried anything like this?

                              <span>Forgive me if this post looks messy/topicless.
 I was trying to style the sidebar notes of org-roam-ui. It&#x27;s been a journey but my finding is mainly that for any change(including style) to take effect, you have to run npm run build or next build in the repo to build a new ./out. That&#x27;s when I find out about that https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui do not work (Node.js version Node.js v20.13.1, ▲ Next.js 14.2.12) anymore. I think it still works on lower version of node.
 The package still works now for me as emacs doesn&#x27;t build it and just use the prebuilt one(2 years old) included in the git repo.
 There&#x27;s 2 main things I found out about it:
  
Most of them on https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/forks don&#x27;t build now (on my setup) for the above reason. They have identical next.config.js. I don&#x27;t know how to fix it (so it build on my setup, which involves editing next.config.js and possibly the project to adapt for node20), so if someone knows please comment. I think it still build with node.js v12 because in odomanov&#x27;s fork, the build 3 months ago went through and that one&#x27;s using github action https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v2 which appears to use node12.
 
https://github.com/odomanov/org-roam-ui have built some interesting thing called &quot;desk&quot; similar to https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-canvas &#x27;s effect. the latter uses obsidian&#x27;s graph and emacs to make html, odomanov on the other hand made something like this:
 
 click on the \&quot;open desk\&quot; button
 will open this \&quot;desk\&quot; where you can have small snippet of node&#x27;s html previews to drag around
 and on a side note 3. That&#x27;s all there is. the only other works on org-roam-ui I&#x27;m aware of is https://github.com/ikoamu/publish-org-roam-ui (which builds on https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro &#x27;s fork) which replaces the websocket communication to emacs to get org-roam-nodes with a js stub thus made org-roam-ui static.

                              <span>Problem Description:
 After the recent Denote upgrade, for some reason, using commands like M-x denote (see the issue: https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/440) does not display the list of notes.
 Since my notes rely on numbering, naming new notes has become a frustrating issue, as I don’t know when I accidentally repeat a number.
 I reported this to the plugin developer, Protesilaos (Port), and he asked if I had enabled savehist-mode. However, after enabling this mode, the problem persisted.
 Unable to tolerate this anymore, I decided to write my own function to solve the issue. I must say, Emacs’ flexibility makes me love it even more.
 Code:
 emacs-lisp (defun my-denote-with-preview () (interactive) (let* ((existing-notes (denote-directory-files)) (existing-titles (mapcar (lambda (file) (or (denote-retrieve-title-value file &#x27;org) (file-name-base file))) existing-notes)) (chosen-title (ivy-read &quot;Choose or enter new note title: &quot; existing-titles :caller &#x27;my-denote-with-preview :action (lambda (x) (setq ivy-text x)) :require-match nil))) (if (member chosen-title existing-titles) (find-file (car (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (file) (when (string&#x3D; (or (denote-retrieve-title-value file &#x27;org) (file-name-base file)) chosen-title) file)) existing-notes)))) (denote chosen-title))))

                              <span>Using shell-script mode, there are some constructs that result in very weird indentation in Emacs when capturing output. The two examples I could come up with (command part usually being multiple lines of code):
 # Capture output of multiline command into variable variablename&#x3D;$( ls -l ) # Capture output of command into array line by line IFS&#x3D;$&#x27;\n&#x27; variablename&#x3D;($( ls -l )) 
 More desirable would be indentation along the lines of
 variablename&#x3D;$( ls -l ) variable-name&#x3D;($( ls -l )) 
 I could not find any relevant options in M-x customize-group sh-indentation. Is there some other way to achieve it?

 I am using emacs 29.1 with native compilation enabled. I have tried to clear the eln-cache multiple times. I think it is possible that native compilation mess up some of the functions.
 But I have tried also emacs **without** native compilation. The phenomenon persists.
 I also tried emacs -Q and things didn&#x27;t get better.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs since a year or so and since the beginning I&#x27;ve always struggled to understand how different pieces fit together in relation to projects.
 Perhaps it&#x27;s a &quot;me&quot; problem, but there seem to be many different concepts and interactions that I fail to even understand how I should go about them in terms of workflow:
  
Treemacs
 Projectile
 Workspaces
 Perspectives
  
I initially tried to simply add my projects/folders with &#x60;SPC p a&#x60;, but they don&#x27;t show up anywhere.
 I also tried &#x60;treemacs-edit-workspaces&#x60;, crafted a set of perspectives each containing a set of projects I&#x27;d epect to be grouped together, but then every time I open a new file everything gets replaced in treemacs.
 Hopefully somebody can shed some light on how all these modules fit together
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a pretty simple approach to debugging: usually all I need to do to find a bug is insert a bunch of statements throughout the code printing to stdout the value of certain variables at various points:
 print(f&quot;keys : {keys}&quot;) console.log(&#x60;x : ${x}&#x60;) etc 
 I have written a few elisp functions to do just that (see here for example). Right now I&#x27;m only covering the few languages I&#x27;ve been working with lately, but I&#x27;m interested in expanding the approach further so it covers multiple languages and is easy to adapt.
 A few questions:
  
am I re-inventing the wheel? Is there already a package that provides this feature? The only similar one I found in package-list-packages is ll-debug, which seems simple but also not actively maintained, and adding modes to it isn&#x27;t super intuitive
 if no to the above questions: is this something people would be interested in? Ideally this package would be: simple to setup with minimal overhead, easy to customize and to add support for new languages. I can&#x27;t guarantee it will be ready soon, but I&#x27;m already working on it for my own workflows, so it&#x27;s in the early stages (unless I find a better approach: see questions above and below)
 I&#x27;m curious what approach to debugging you all use: am I making a mistake by keeping things so simple? what are some more complex debugging capabilities, and are there ways to run these in a way that is consistent across languages (like the debug-print approach)?

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 If your org-roam database is large, chances are you are waiting more than 1 second for org-roam-find-node to show candidates.
 This is a package that improves the performance of org-roam-find-node. It runs between 4-10 times faster, while maintaining total compatibility. In fact, you can enable/disable the package without any adverse effects.
 The package also extends the org-speed-commands with a hydra, accessible with the letter m. Only two commands are accesible: org-roam-refile and org-roam-extract-subtree (open an issue if you would like to see other commands).
 The only potential issue is if you use a custom template. One of the areas where org-roam spends a lot of time is formatting the template. To reduce this time the template can be a function (which is much faster than processing the template string). The template function provided in the package should be good enough for most users, but adding a new template function is easy. See code for details.
 It is a minor mode, so to enable and disable simply run org-roam-gt-mode
 https://github.com/dmgerman/org-roam-gt
 if somebody can point me to information on how to upload it to a repo of packages, I&#x27;ll do that. In the meantime, download it from github.

Don&#x27;t know if this problem belongs to Workflows or Research &amp; Reading category
As title says, how to manage such inflow of info and (lingering) diverse bits of info (and use them)?
I was researching this forum but couldnt find the solution.
I&#x27;m aware of collector fallacy and low value of inactive ideas.
I will name an item in the following text any atomic idea, observation, concept, relation, insight, fact, definition, tool, app, inspiration etc.
Even with filtering out the inflow the problems persist.
Situation:
Some amount of items impossible to relate anywhere at the moment.
So they stay in that big pile or amalgam inside inbox.
You are sure that those items are important, you have come up with usage for them. But it&#x27;s impossible because of missing parts you don&#x27;t know of (lack o…</span>

                              <span>I imagine that inlining everything will result in a higher-performance executable. First, is my premise wrong? Second, I see two practical problems: (1) looooooong compile times, and (2) huge size of the resulting binary executable. Problem 2 doesn’t sound like a showstopper to me, so is Problem 1 the only real barrier. Are there other practical problems I’m unaware of?

                              <span>Hey fellow Haskellers,
 I’m excited to announce that Functional Design and Architecture has just been released by Manning! 🎉 This project has been years in the making, and it’s finally ready to make a splash in the world of functional programming. 🌍
 Why should you care?
 For years, Haskell users have been asking for more guidance on best practices, application architecture, and design patterns—things we’ve seen abundant in OOP, but far less in FP. This book aims to fill that void. (You can find my article &quot;The Voids of Haskell&quot; very interesting in this regard; it&#x27;s about imaginary Haskell books we could have but don&#x27;t yet.)

                              <span>Hey everyone! I relatively recently developed an SBT plugin for Buf
 A quick primer as to what Buf is that shamelessly copies the docs:
 The buf CLI is a tool for working with Protocol Buffers.
  
The ability to manage Protobuf assets on the Buf Schema Registry (BSR).
 A linter that enforces good API design choices and structure.
 A breaking change detector that enforces compatibility at the source code or wire level.
 A generator that invokes your plugins based on configurable templates.
 A formatter that formats your Protobuf files in accordance with industry standards.
 Integration with the Buf Schema Registry, including full dependency management.
  
If this sounds interesting, and you want to delve further into all the things Buf can do for you, I&#x27;d recommend taking a look at Buf&#x27;s Do…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to insert a template as a child in a current heading.
 I would like to use something like this target (from template elements@org-doc):
 (id &quot;id of existing org entry&quot;)
 which enters the template as a child of the current heading. But in my case my entries don&#x27;t (as a rule) have ID&#x27;s.
 So ideally, there would be target option in addition to (here) which will insert it at the point (which is close but not exactly what I want)
 (body-of-current-entry)
 I can try and write a function, but I&#x27;d rather not re-invent the wheel.
 Thanks!

 as not to repeat myself here is an issue I opened in their repo https://github.com/sourcegraph/emacs-cody/issues/40
 TLDR; cody runs for about a minute and then the node process is no longer responsive.
 if anyone has it working would you please post your requirements config, I would really appreciate that.

                              <span>Hello.
 I am currently in the process of deciding on my next long term working and development environment and Emacs is a hot contender.
 Due to specific personal interests and requirements, I would like to begin my Emacs adventure with a maybe slightly unconvential approach, that is, starting with nothing but the Emacs runtime and step by step adding all keybinds for commands that I require and desire, sort of a bootstrap process for building my own environment.
 As far as I can tell I would need the following:
  
Removal of all default keybinds
 Discovery of available commands (external is fine, I don&#x27;t care about &quot;purity&quot; in the boostrap)
  
Can you point me to any resource that would help me in my plan? Maybe someone with experience going for this approach?

 2024-09-17 09:25:15.751 Emacs[2368:31256] +[IMKClient subclass]: chose IMKClient_Legacy 2024-09-17 09:25:15.751 Emacs[2368:31256] +[IMKInputSession subclass]: chose IMKInputSession_Legacy
 Not concerned, this is just an experience report. Emacs is 30.0.90 from homebrew emacs-plus@30.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve recently started using Gnus to manage my emails but haven&#x27;t been able to configure the Summary buffer exactly as I&#x27;d like. Specifically, I want all threads to be collapsed into a single article (the most recent one) and have the threads sorted by the latest date, in descending order.
 Here are lines from my config:
 (setopt gnus-thread-sort-functions &#x27;(gnus-thread-sort-by-number gnus-thread-sort-by-most-recent-date) gnus-subthread-sort-functions &#x27;(gnus-thread-sort-by-number (not gnus-thread-sort-by-date)) gnus-sort-gathered-threads-function &#x27;gnus-thread-sort-by-date gnus-summary-thread-gathering-function &#x27;gnus-gather-threads-by-subject gnus-thread-hide-subtree t gnus-thread-ignore-subject t) 
 With this setup, all threads are hidden behind their root articles and sorted by the most recent date. However, the issue I’m facing is that the Summary buffer shows the root article instead of the most recent one in each thread.
 I&#x27;ve tried to play with gnus-subthread-sort-functions without success.
 Does anyone know if it’s possible to achieve what I’m aiming for?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi there,
 It find myself, very often, in the situation of having to create CLOCK entries in LOGBOOK drawers by hand.
 Either because I forgot to clock in, or most commonly: because I was doing several things AFK and want to log them all when back.
 Right now I do it by hand, I tyope &quot;CLOCK: &quot; then the timestamps. Which feels... archaic.
 Does anyone have a nice cool function that will ask me for two timestamps (or an initial timestamp and a duration) and create the CLOCK entry?

 xmonad 0.18.0.9 (Ubuntu 22.04 underneath)
 GNU Emacs v29.4
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre
 Doom modules v24.10.0-pre 
 I&#x27;m struggling to get doom modelline to stop truncating my vcs branch name at &quot;-&quot;, which happens regardless of whether I set vcs-max-length to 1000000. When there is no &quot;-&quot; in the name, there is no problems.
 I have tried this whole scratch setup in config.el:
 (setq doom-modeline-vcs-max-length 1000
 doom-modeline-vcs-display-function #&#x27;doom-modeline-vcs-name)
 I&#x27;ve also tried to write my own version doom-modeline-vcs-name, but I&#x27;m not strong at elisp, and I&#x27;ve never managed to get a &quot;HelloWorld&quot; through on the modelline.
 Could somebody please help me? :)

 From what I understand, if it&#x27;s possible for Kittens to derive instances of - Eq, - Show, - Functor or - Foldable
 for custom ADTs, those instances are respectively the only mathematically possible ones.
 This might not be true for Traverse, instead.
 TIA! 🙏

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I want to talk about lack of DevOps expertise inside the organizations. Not every company can or should have a full time DevOps Engineer. Let’s say we want to train Developers to handle DevOps tasks. With the disclaimer that DevOps is the approach and not a job position 😉 
 1/ What are the most common cases that you need DevOps for, but you&#x27;re handling it?
 2/ What kind of DevOps challenges do you have in your projects?
 3/ What DevOps problems are slowing you down?
 Is there any subject you want to know from scratch or upgrade your existing knowledge - with DevOps mindeset/toolset?
 Thanks in advance!

 A week ago I was interviewed by Frank Delporte about JavaFX, GraalVM Native Image, and how to make Android app in Scala. Here&#x27;s the link. I hope you enjoy. If you have questions, let me know, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer the best I can.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have been going over my config lately to simplify my first orgmode setup. The more I learn, the more I can see that I have been trying to reinvent the wheel. Anyway, I have been playing around with the clock, and the &#x27;effort&#x27; estimates and I am considering using effort to simplify some of my lists.
 The problem is that I use exclusively &#x60;org-ql-blocks&#x60; for my agenda views, and I was unsuccessful in my attempts at filtering them using &#x60;se&#x60; and then selecting some criterias. I tried some other filters too, and I could only restrict the org-ql-blocks within agenda views when using &#x60;sc&#x60; and &#x60;st&#x60;, respectively category and tags.
 Since I know from the documentation that &#x27;everything is supposed to work&#x27; in agenda views but not guaranteed to, I was wondering if the problem was on my side or if someone else could reproduce the error.
 When trying to restrict an org-ql-block using a regex for example, I do not get an error even if it does not work as I would expect, but when trying to apply an &#x60;effort&#x60; filter, I get the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (args-out-of-range 0 0) get-text-property(0 effort-minutes nil) (let ((effort (get-text-property 0 &#x27;effort-minutes (org-get-at-bol &#x27;txt)))) (funcall op (or effort (if org-agenda-sort-noeffort-is-high 32767 -1)) value)) org-agenda-compare-effort(&#x3D; 30.0) (and (org-agenda-compare-effort &#x27;&#x3D; 30.0)) eval((and (org-agenda-compare-effort &#x27;&#x3D; 30.0)) t) (if (eval org-agenda-filter-form t) nil (org-agenda-filter-hide-line type)) 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi Org-Mode community! Long time lurker, first time poster. I&#x27;m using Org-Mode to produce LaTeX files. Basically, I&#x27;m looking for a way to export the &quot;+&quot; plain list item as &quot;\item[$\square$]&quot; and the &quot;-&quot; plain list item as &quot;\item[$\bullet$]&quot;, but I can&#x27;t find any way to do it. I tried using the variable org-latex-listing but it seems that this variable is obsolete.
 (defun my-org-latex-customize-lists ()
 &quot;Customize LaTeX export of Org-mode lists.&quot;
 (setq org-latex-listings
 &#x27;((+ . &quot;\\item[$\\bullet$]&quot;)
 (- . &quot;\\item[$\\square$]&quot;))))
 I did make my own latex-class. I suspect I have to change something here...
 ;; &gt; Creating latex-classes and adding them to org-latex-classes :
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes
 ( list &quot;org-report&quot;
 (concat &quot;\\documentclass[10pt]{article}&quot; contenu-preambule)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\section{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\section*{%s}&quot;)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\subsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\subsection*{%s}&quot;)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\subsubsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\subsubsection*{%s}&quot;)
 &#x27;(&quot;\\paragraph{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\paragraph*{%s}&quot;)))
 In any case, I know you can do it, because I already do it in Org-Mode with Org-Superstar...
 (use-package org-superstar
 :ensure t
 :hook (org-mode . org-superstar-mode)
 :config
 (setq org-superstar-item-bullet-alist
 &#x27;((?* . &quot;•&quot;) ;; Puce pour les listes à puces
 (?+ . &quot;▪&quot;) ;; Puce pour les sous-listes
 (?- . &quot;•&quot;)))
 So I&#x27;m looking for a variable that look likes the superstar one to change the export. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ChatGPT didn&#x27;t help either.
 Edit : Correcting mistakes.

                              <span>I am surprised that no one has created a literal index card box, digitally. Rendering an actual box, actual drawers, and a search function to pick out a card.
I will say this, the closest I have seen is a small program on itchio called Decker
It is a recreation and expansion of the old index card mac program (back when Apple still looked like the fruit), very versatile, very user- supported.
I designed a primitive template to use as index cards. Linking cards is not fluid, but maybe someone will make a deck that does that.
Check it out.</span>

                              <span>I am an app addict.
Just when I get cozy with one app; I need a theme or extension or just a new experience.
I have gone from real index cards, bullet journals, tiddlywiki, feather wiki, trillium, zettlr, and now on Logseq. Then back and forth between analog and digital.
This movement gets in the way of the actual work; and unfortunately it’s worse for straight fiction- writing.
Anyone else have this problem? Suggestions?
PS: I tried hypernomicon too; and the only great thing it has is the name- so cool!</span>

                              <span>I’m very eager to start using zettlelkastan to help with generating new ideas and creating blogs and aiding me in my research. I’ve only watched a few videos of it and have a vague idea how it works but I don’t wanna end up overplanning and never doing it. I want to do a physical and digital zettlekastan system. I have bought post it tabs (not sure if useful but it could be used to tab my dividers) and index cards. How do I store my index cards? Are there places to buy boxes made specifically for storing index cards or will I have to make them?</span>

When I press  after I select some top level function, instead of jumping to that function, imenu present me a new list with variables names defined in that function, and so on....
 Is there a way to jump to a top level function?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to get mu4e (latest version, using emacs 29.3) to show an email&#x27;s date/time in my local time zone. This works in the headers view, but not in the message view, where the time typically is shown in UTC time zone or sometimes in other time zones (it might be using the sender&#x27;s time zone?).
 While debugging the message view, &#x60;mu4e~headers-field-value&#x60; seems to return the time in my local time zone (correct behaviour), but something else seems to change it afterwards to a different time zone. I haven&#x27;t altered the values of &#x60;mu4e-headers-time-format&#x60; (&quot;%X&quot;) or &#x60;mu4e-headers-long-date-format&#x60; (&quot;%c&quot;). Also, &#x60;current-time-zone&#x60; returns the right time zone for my locale.
 Any ideas what is changing the time zone in mu4e&#x27;s message view, or how to force using my current time zone?

Like consult-buffer separates open buffers and bookmarks, and consult-ripgrep separates sections by files. These section titles are colored black which makes them hard to see with a black background. I can&#x27;t seem to find which face to change to change the color of these titles.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;d started writing some code to integrate the BiomeJS Javascript linter/formatter and having done most of the hard work (arguably a bunch of hacks, but it works) I was now writing here to tell you folks about it.
 I knew about the prior existence of https://github.com/cxa/lsp-biome, which I was going to mention here and explain I don&#x27;t use LSP hence why I&#x27;d written more code instead of using that package.
 But when I did search for lsp-biome, I actually stumbled upon two packages that do exactly what my package do but better:
  
https://github.com/yadex205/emacs-biomejs-format
 https://github.com/craneduck/flycheck-biomejs
  
I don&#x27;t know how the hell I missed them in my initial search but here they are...
 In the hope that it might prevent someone else from writing a bunch of hacks, I thought I&#x27;d keep writing this post anyway and leave the instructions to set them up together:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp ;; BiomeJS Flycheck integration (straight-use-package &#x27;(flycheck-biomejs :type git :host github :repo &quot;craneduck/flycheck-biomejs&quot; :require t))
 ;; BiomeJS format-on-save (straight-use-package &#x27;(emacs-biomejs-format :type git :host github :repo &quot;yadex205/emacs-biomejs-format&quot; :require t :config ( (add-hook &#x27;js2-mode-hook &#x27;biomejs-format-mode) (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;biomejs-format-mode)))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Continuing a previous objective:
  
Ergonomic folds: generics-sop recursion schemes, without &quot;base functor&quot;
  
A previous post reminded me of the idea to improve the ergonomics of recursion schemes.
  
What exactly is the point of recursion schemes
  
I haven&#x27;t worked with plugins but I wanted to find a way to use recursion schemes by giving algebraic datatypes a virtual base functor. The base functor structure is already latent in recursive datatypes and can be recreated by abstracting out recursive positions:
 type Base :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type data Base as a instance Functor (Base as) 
 This is an empty datatype declaration, Base [a] list is the base functor of lists. Then the way to construct values of type Base [a] is to use the constructors of the recursive type: [] and (:), obviously at a different type. This is more natural than dealing with a separate datatype and it helps keep it in sync, but to avoid confusion they can be renamed, Base.[].
 {- -- virtual datatype defined by the plugin type Base :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type data Base [a] list where Base.[] :: Base [a] list (Base.:) :: a -&gt; list -&gt; Base [a] list deriving stock Functor -} -- project &#x3D; unsafeCoerce project :: [a] -&gt; Base [a] [a] project [] &#x3D; Base.[] project (a:as) &#x3D; a Base.: as cata :: (Base [a] res -&gt; res) -&gt; ([a] -&gt; res) cata alg &#x3D; res where res &#x3D; alg . fmap res . project len :: [a] -&gt; Int len &#x3D; cata \case Base.[] -&gt; 0 _Base.:n -&gt; 1 + n 
 Is there any way to make this work?

                              <span>We are working on a research paper titled “What about Haskell bugs? Adapting bug taxonomies to Haskell’s features and community”. The goal of this research is to investigate whether existing bug taxonomies from literature can accurately capture bugs in Haskell and assess their potential usefulness for the Haskell community.
 We are looking to speak with experienced Haskell developers or maintainers who are willing to participate in a short, 30-minute recorded interview (recordings and transcripts will remain private; only anonymized excerpts and quotes may be shared). During the interview, we&#x27;ll discuss your experiences handling Haskell bugs — how you identify, understand, classify, and fix them. We&#x27;ll also present some existing bug taxonomies for you to share your opinions.
 If you are interested or know someone else who might be you can contact me at [R3c55+HaskellDevCall@proton.me](mailto:R3c55+HaskellDevCall@proton.me) or my colleague, Leonhard, at [l.h.applis@tudelft.nl](mailto:l.h.applis@tudelft.nl).
 Thank you for considering this opportunity!
 All the best, 
 Razvan

 Despite the long struggle to make streaming abstractions finalize (release resources) promptly (for example, by implementing special-purpose bracketing operations using ResourceT for conduit and SafeT for pipes), they still fail in this task. At best, they have &quot;promptish&quot; finalization.
 Streams implemented in Bluefin, on the other hand, do finalize promptly and can even use general-purpose bracketing!
 My article explains the situation.

 In the code below is the some syntax which allow the SQL command to be applied to each row.
 I have seen some examples which based on Elisp which use some mapxxxx and cl-destructuring-bind functions to obtain the values with Elisp and format them for other languages, but I think there is a syntax where org-mode recognizes the var used for the table and uses the values in the formula.

                              <span>I need clarification to the Zettlekaten parts and their function. For example tags, bibliography etc. I am going to create strictly an analog system. I have yet found anyone to fully explain the exact parts and function. I read Scott’s book but it is very confusing and elusive. The language littered with unclarified concrete explanations. I’ve tried to watch and read as much as possible but still very elusive. Thanks</span>

 Is it an attribute that the font itself needs to support?
 Does it depend on the particular type of font?

                              <span>On many modes, e.g. text-mode, M- calls ispell-complete-word. This function suggests word completions from a dictionary.
 In my case, M- yields an error: ispell-lookup-words: No plain word-list found at systemdefault locations. Customize ‘ispell-alternate-dictionary’ to set yours.
 However, I have Hunspell 1.7.2 installed (on NixOS) and spellchecking (M-$ ispell-word) works fine. But Hunspell dictionaries do not seem to work as plain word lists and I don&#x27;t really know how to set this up. Any ideas how to fix this?
 There are some related reports, like https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomEmacs/comments/qw8xn7, but I haven&#x27;t found a solution. In my case this issue happens on GNU Emacs 29.4 with no .emacs or init.el configuration.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am trying to use the calendar/diary of emacs in italian, and so I set 
 (setq calendar-date-display-form (quote ((if dayname (concat dayname &quot;, &quot;)) day &quot; &quot; monthname &quot; &quot; year)) 
 which correctly shows me Lunedì, 16 Settembre 2024 if I press d on a day of the calendar where there is some data in the diary. This is the format I want on display.
 The problem is that if I set that variable, inserting a new appointment in the diary with i d, the date is inserted with this format:
 16 Set 2024
 and is not showing in the calendar (No diary entries for Lunedì, 16 Settembre 2024).
 Without that variable setting, instead I get in the diary entry the standard format:
 Set 16, 2024
 which is parsed correclty and shows in the calendar.
 How can I make the whole thing work in italian?
 thanks!

                              <span>Since installing Emacs 31, I noticed a strange issue: if I try to look at the documentation of pcase, Emacs becomes very, very slow. It takes a few seconds to a) show the result in Vertico and b) open the documentation. Even evaluating (describe-function &#x27;pcase) is extremely slow. I discovered that, for some reason, not loading lsp-mode and related packages improves the issue. I&#x27;ve also tried disabling and sequentially re-enabling packages from my config but couldn&#x27;t find the culprit. To do that, I tried to put my config in a catch statement (to stop the execution at a certain point), like this:
 (catch &#x27;my-exit ;; I want to execute this (throw &#x27;my-exit &quot;Stop here&quot;) ;; I don&#x27;t want to execute this ) 
 I&#x27;m pretty sure that what I did there is probably stupid, but I&#x27;m not an Elisp expert. Anyway, after putting all my config in the catch-throw statement (even with the throw as the last line), I couldn&#x27;t reproduce the bug.
 I initially experienced the (describe-function &#x27;pcase) bug on macOS and thought that this was in some way OS-specific, but I compiled Emacs 31+ on my Linux machine today and the same thing happens.
 At this point, I&#x27;m just very curious about what is happening. If someone has a clue, I&#x27;d appreciate it!

                              <span>Heya! 
 I’m curious if anyone in this community knows if it’s possible to setup a ctrl lock key instead of caps lock? 
 My hands don’t do chording too well and begin to hurt overtime. I know there is god mode which I can use to avoid it, but even better in my mind would be to set up a “ctrl lock” in the place of caps lock . That way I don’t have to install a plugin and complicate my .emacs.
 I am curious if anyone has any idea if that can be setup on Linux Xorg?

 It is not rare to have my macbook spinning fans at maximum speed, cpu usage high and battery going down, just because I loaded some file with a &#x27;not yet compiled&#x27; dependency.
 Also, a &quot;emacs --native-compile-all-packages&quot; to run in advance in order to reduce this sort of compilations while really using Emacs would be great.
 Is there something we can control about it?

 This lighter color line in the mode line is bugging me. Is it an extra border or is it misplaced?
 I really like Solarized Theme, but this thing keeps me away from it.

                              <span>I installed emacs-mac using brew: brew install emacs-mac --with-natural-title-bar --with-mac-metal --with-xwidgets --with-dbus --with-glib --with-imagemagick
 Even if I start it without loading any configuration: /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q, it still takes about 3 seconds for the main window to appear.
 If I start it in the terminal /usr/local/opt/emacs-mac/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q -nw, it takes about 0.8 seconds to show up. This is acceptable.
 I also tested https://emacsformacosx.com/ and got similar results.
 Why does the UI of emacs on Mac take so long to appear? Is there any way to speed it up? 
 For comparison, the UI of VSCode takes about 1 second, and Zed&#x27;s UI takes about 0.5 seconds to appear.
 My Mac is a MacBook Pro 15-inch, 2019 (2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7, 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4).
 Please do not suggest using emacsclient; this post focuses on solving / investigating the initial startup window / UI display speed of emacs-mac.

With the chromebook, i was using--and learning--linux, and *the ways of linux* (via chromeos&#x27;s-lxd-vm-&quot;crostini&quot;-container-thing). It felt like being a programmer in the 1970s. Terminals? Unix? Bash?? Looks like Perl! Fish--now we&#x27;re in the 80s, baby! Dotfiles? Nvim!? Nvim configs? \barf*.* Now that i&#x27;ve got a proper windows laptop from the lovely Taiwan, i am immediately delighted to toss out unix (*nix?) for powershell. This may be the one time i&#x27;m deeply grateful for Microsoft&#x27;s strict &#x27;n consistent naming conventions (im-a-bit-unconventional).

 Thanks to Protesilaos (also known as Prot).
 When I use Emacs 29, I only used the default theme because it was simple and eased my eyes. I tried other light themes including Modus operandi but it&#x27;s a little high contrast to my eyes. But with Emacs 30.0.91 the modus-operandi theme is much better. Prot has included a total 8 modus themes on 30.0.91, all other Modus themes also have very good quality. Some pictures of the modus-operandi theme on my (Doom) Emacs:

                              <span>Compatible with Emacs 30 and later versions.
 Overview files now have more elegant names, reducing repetitive occurrences of the word “overview.”
 Fixed an intermittent (setq, 5) error.
 Removed the dependency on conda.el in org-zettel-ref-mode.el, and the detection of the Python environment is now entirely handled by convert-to-org.py. 
 Automatically sets up a virtual environment via the python venv command and installs required libraries. 
 Note: After updating to this version, running convert-to-org.py will reinstall third-party libraries. If you prefer a clean environment, you may want to manage this manually.
 
 
 Improved synchronization mechanism for overview files, preventing multiple overview files from being created for the same source file. Also improved the robustness and stability of this feature. 
 A hash table is now used to map source files to overview files. One great thing is that you don’t need to manually set the hash table file location.
 The overview file header now includes a new property block: #+SOURCE-FILE: to confirm the mapping.
 New commands: 
 org-zettel-ref-check-and-repair-links - Check and repair links between source files and overview files.
 org-zettel-ref-maintenance-menu - Display a menu for org-zettel-ref-mode maintenance operations.
 org-zettel-ref-refresh-index - Manually refresh the overview index.
 org-zettel-ref-rescan-overview-files - Rescan the overview directory and update the index.
 org-zettel-ref-status - Display the current status of org-zettel-ref-mode.

                              <span>Hey everyone, my first post in this community - the emacs fever has taken hold. I am currently holding my first weekly review with org-mode and was wondering if it is possible to display all the tasks I have completed in the last 7 days... of course, its emacs probably there is a function for it :D
 I enabled org-log-done and will now have my future DONE tasks logged. I found that by using the &quot;m&quot; option on the Agenda I can filter for TODO&#x3D;&quot;DONE&quot;&amp;CLOSED&gt;&#x3D;&quot;&quot; and the agenda shows me what I want.
 Now, I know we can run lisp in org-files and I want to add a snippet to my Weekly review template that queries the org-agenda and inserts the output under the current subheading. I have looked trough a few StackOverflow posts and I am quite frankly lost were to even start since I dont understand what Helm calls as a function to query the org-agenda. 
 I would love to learn what your process is when you create such a workflow, how can I solve this problem without just copy and pasting a solution? I really want to learn the mindset to get my hands dirty with future problems.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m trying to install Haskell on windows and I followed these instructions from the official site (https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/). The install gets through the main phase, but then I get this error message:
 ERROR: The certificate of ‘www.haskell.org’ is not trusted.
 ERROR: The certificate of ‘www.haskell.org’ doesn&#x27;t have a known issuer.
 Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? I&#x27;m very new to writing to the shell so I&#x27;m not really sure how to do the manual installation and which commands to change. Thanks!
