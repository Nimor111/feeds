 Thanks to work of u/angerman we now can compile mobile apps for iOS and Android with 9.6.3, but iPhone 7 (and earlier) and Android 10 are not supported yet with this build, so it uses GHC 8.10.7 for mobile apps and 9.6.3 in desktop apps.
 Some observation about 9.6.3 on mobile: it seems to have reduced overall CPU usage, but made apps much less responsive. Surprisingly, it was resolved by moving hs_init call to background thread - nothing in the docs suggested that it would made any difference, but it made the apps much more responsive on iOS (yet to test on Android).
 Does anybody know why it could have happened?
 We now use these RTS options that also help responsiveness and reduce memory usage by 10% (when the usage was large): - -A16m (chunk size for new allocations) - -H64m (initial heap size) - -xn (non-moving GC)
 Let me know if you have any comments on these!
 Thank you!

 ( [x | x  173 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 300, x &#x60;mod&#x60; 3 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0] :: [Integer] ) 
 Problem is this infinite list version goes crazy because it&#x27;s not being overruled. Is there a way to, e.g., take just the numbers in the following range clause?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m learning Haskell by writing a client library for NATS (nats.io). I&#x27;ve come to a point where I need to use UUIDs, and the examples I&#x27;ve come across online rely on running the &#x27;app&#x27; in a monad that provides the UUIDs. 
 Given that I&#x27;m writing a library, when interacting with this library as a consumer would you expect to interact with it in the context of a monad, or is there some pattern that avoids this?
 Edit: the example mentioned above is shown here https://stackoverflow.com/a/58908135

                              <span>For awhile Scala was on a more or less 6-week rolling release schedule.
 Since 3.3.1 (September 7th) that appears to have stopped. Anyone know what&#x27;s changed, or is this just a temporary delay?

                              <span>Recently, I started to sense that I was really struggling with using my Zettelkasten. For whatever reason, feeling some order in the midst to the chaos, seemed out of my grasp without spending a lot of time figuring things out. So, I thought to myself, &quot;What if I just started over, and tried out folgezettel even though I think @Sascha has convinced me it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary?&quot;
Well, I have to report early that, while I feel like someone that should be able to workout without the need for a personal trainer, I like the personal trainer... a lot.
I don&#x27;t know what it is! But, there is something about the id&#x27;s and just needing to loosely relate one to the next one that helps to create focus and clarity.
I&#x27;m sorry for this moment, leaving: 20231125055521 -- At least for now. Maybe one day, I&#x27;ll be able to exercise without a personal trainer. But, today, I&#x27;m just happy I&#x27;m working out.</span>

                              <span>I talked to someone about the extensibility of emacs, but the person I was speaking to assumed that any IDE is just as extensible by using Plug Ins.
 Without turning the conversation into a university style lecture, what is one or two simple actions I can do in emacs to show someone what separates it from other IDES.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am not sure if many people are using alerts for the appointments, I do, I like the behavior where it brings Emacs to the front and shows a message in the mini buffer. However, when I am quickly writing in another application I sometimes end up writing in the active buffer. I am contemplating creating a function which puts the buffer in read only mode before showing switching to Emacs, if it was not already Read Only, and restores it when the reminder disappears. That should be enough to avoid accidental writing.
 Before I embark in that task I would like to know if anybody has done anything like that, or any other creative ideas to avoid contaminating the current buffer.
 Thanks!

 I open files over tramp and use a remote login machine to do that. Said login machine is shared by many people and thus I can’t run a language server on it. I’d like to use eglot but don’t want to run the language server on it. 
 I’ve been trying to either run the language server on a computer machine (another remote one) or on my local Mac (Mac would be preferable). 
 Has anyone managed to point a language server running on a local Mac to files over ssh?

 hi all,
 I installed emacs using
  
brew install --cask emacs
  
when I launch Emacs from the terminal with
  
emacs
  
None of the keystrokes respond in emacs and all show up in the terminal window.
 I&#x27;m running:
  
Macbook pro m3 max
 Sonoma 14.1 (23B2073)
  
Never had this problem when emacs was previously installed on my macs. Any ideas on what the issue might be?
 thank you

                              <span>Hi!
 Lennart gave a presentation about combinators and graph reduction at the FP seminars at Chalmers a few months ago. He wrote a little implementation to demo at the talk, and just never stopped writing code. Today he came back and gave a presentation about MicroHaskell. It is an &quot;extended subset&quot; of Haskell, which is compiled to combinators and evaluated via graph reduction, implemented by a runtime-system written in 2500 lines of C.
 Here is a recording of the presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Zk5SJ79nOnA
 Here is his repo: https://github.com/augustss/MicroHs
 I hope some of you find it as interesting as we did :)

                              <span>I really enjoy using Kafka, and in my company we currently use it as the central piece of our event-driven architecture. We are a Node and Python shop. 
 Given Kafka is written in Scala and Java, are we missing anything by not using Scala (or even JVM-based) clients?

                              <span>The Commit Mono font has a feature that it calls &quot;smart kerning&quot;. Monaspace has a similar feature that it calls &quot;texture healing.&quot; Characters are moved around slightly, or swapped out for a slightly larger or smaller character to even out the spacing, for example, when a wide character like an &#x27;m&#x27; is followed by a narrow character like an &#x27;l&#x27;. 
 The effect looks nice on their web sites. It worked in VSCode, but not in Emacs. The &quot;smart kerning&quot; / &quot;texture healing&quot; features did not seem to be activated when I tried the fonts in Emacs. 
 How would I get this to work in Emacs? The Monaspace docs say you have to add &quot;&#x27;calt&#x27;&quot; to &quot;editor.ligatures&quot; in the VSCode Settings. Commit Mono just worked without changing the settings.
 I might end up hating the moving around, but I&#x27;d have to try it for a few hours to see. I&#x27;m just not sure how to set that up in Emacs, or if Emacs supports that sort of thing.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running into an issue where Emacs (Spacemacs if relevant) would complain about invalid UTF-8 characters in the temp file buffer that was generated when saving a file I was editing with EPA. Telling me to select a fallback coding system.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; These default coding systems were tried to encode the following problematic characters in the buffer ‘ temp file’:
 Coding System Pos Codepoint Char
 utf-8 1 #x3FFF84 �
 ... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I don&#x27;t think this makes sense, obviously the encrypted file would have bad UTF-8 characters but why would Emacs complain about this? This file is an org-mode file that was encrypted with GPG. The warning pops up reliably a few seconds after I save, and sporadically when I&#x27;m editing. It is making it unusable because it pops up even after I select an option.
 Any suggestion on where I could even begin to try fixing this?

 This is done with Emacs slurping text from any buffer and barfing it into the standard Java repl, run in a background process. These phases are glued together using the repl-driven-development.el package.

                              <span>Hey! I use Cherrytree for journaling, but it has a few things I want to change, and lack a few things that I need. Plus, I&#x27;m worry about locking myself in one app, so I&#x27;m exploring the possibility of using Neovim or Emacs, but I&#x27;m aware there&#x27;s a learning curve, and before investing time, I wanted to know if I&#x27;m using the right tool.
 I need to do the following in a quick way:
 1- Encrypt a whole folder, and acces it. This folder will keep other folders with pictures and text files.
 2- Set a number of columns for the page, like 80 or 100.
 3- Have a tree-like explorer on the left, to navigate the files with the entries.
 4- Do bold, italics, and different colors.
 5- Make an index or a different way to navigate the entries, besides the tree explorer.
 6- Export everything in case I want to change the program I use to read my entries.
 7- Inserting an image from a folder, like a picture I took. It can be a miniature to click and open the original picture.
 Can Emacs do that? 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m considering to use dired as main file browser for Windows. I would like to use &quot;context.exe&quot; app (http://www.maddogsw.com/cmdutils/ ) that shows explorer context menu of specified file, but the app is not updated for more than 20 years and it seems no longer working.
 Is there any modern version of file context menu tool nowadays?

                              <span>Hello r/emacs! First-time poster here!
 I recently wanted to visualise some data in org-mode using a Python source block to generate an image, which was then rendered directly in the buffer.
 It took my a couple of goes to work out how to do it. 
 Given some data like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +begin_src bash :results output file :file data.njson
 echo &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Spock&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;James Kirk&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Vim&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Dr McCoy&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Vim&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Scotty&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Worf&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;ed&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Geordi LaForge&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Data&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Emacs&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Jean-luc Picard&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;VS Code&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Wesley Crusher&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;VS Code&quot;} {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;William Riker&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;: &quot;Vim&quot;} &#x27;
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 A visualisation can be rendered as follows:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +begin_src python :results output file :file usage.png
 import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import sys
 df &#x3D; pd.read_json(&quot;data.njson&quot;, lines&#x3D;True) axes &#x3D; sns.histplot(df, x&#x3D;&quot;editor&quot;) axes.get_figure().savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The main trick here is to set the :results output file header argument to write the output to a file, and to save the figure to sys.stdout.buffer from Python.
 I&#x27;ve written about this on my blog too, where you can see the [unsurprising] results of the analysis!

                              <span>tl;dr why do my org links not have a space before them (e.g. check out thisLINK)? I feel I&#x27;m missing something very basic here.
 I was using org-roam today in doom emacs and forgot how irritating adding a new node is while writing. 
 It nestles nicely up to the text before it - with no space in between. After posting on r/orgroam a kind soul told me this might be a wider issue - at least related to org itself, and maybe doom.
 Does anyone know how to get a leading space before the node name / link? For example; my nodes come out looking like:
 something interesting is in thisNODENAME/LINK check it out
 For the love of RMS I want a space between this and NODENAME
 I&#x27;m clearly being dumb, but can&#x27;t figure this out. Surely enough people use emacs / doom emacs / org mode, and they are not all adding links everywhere with no leading space?
 A suggestion on r/orgroam was put a double space before a link - is that it?

                              <span>When I do package-list-packages and I&#x27;m searching for a package, the search is not restricted to the package names, but searches the descriptions as well, and this requires scrolling down before starting the search.
 Can the search be restricted to the column with the names?

                              <span>Hey All,
 I wrote another beginner-focussed blog about the Table based testing in ScalaTest. 
 https://yadukrishnan.live/effective-test-parameterization-with-scalatest-tables
 This might be too basic for experienced developers. However, during code reviews and other discussions, I have noticed that a lot of test could be converted into Table-based test to improve the readability and maintainability. Hence thought of writing this.
 Please have a look and let me know if you find this useful.
 Thanks!

                              <span>For those who have reservations about the syntax of comprehensions, and there are a few, here&#x27;s one possible alternative
 The approach is to extend an existing function to handle additional argument types, so that it replicates a comprehension via a single function call. For instance a function of two integers is among other things extended to also apply to two ranges of integers. There are some similarities with vectorization (see R, MATLAB, Julia and the like), although here you don&#x27;t have to mix row vectors and column vectors.
 It&#x27;s a kind of Polish notation for comprehensions: you&#x27;re saying the same thing as before, but everything has been rearranged, and the main function comes first. Perhaps not unlike the original Polish notation, it takes some getting used to, and won&#x27;t be to everyone&#x27;s taste. But there are arguably a few advantages:
  
no need for specialized syntax: no on-the-fly variable bindings, so no left-arrows (or &quot;for&quot; or &quot;yield&quot;)
 generally more concise notation that meshes well with Scala&#x27;s use of underscores for lambda functions
 a direct style that can be used with effect handling, e.g. with Cats or ZIO
 a clear distinction between independent and dependent terms, determined by the static types
  
This last property means that by default the library is a bit of a hybrid of David Turner&#x27;s original list comprehension (which can handle any case, but always returns a sequence), and a more Julia-style array comprehension when things are &quot;rectangular&quot;. This makes it straightforward to plot a function (via JavaScript and plotly). It also means an inherent distinction between the parallelizable and the sequential, i.e. applicatives and - the term was bound to crop up eventually - monads.
 Essentially it&#x27;s a function-centric version of comprehensions, for those who would prefer not to use specialized syntax or macros, or maybe just want comprehensions in Java.

 &gt; In type Recipe, field ingredients, entry flour: Weight must be non-negative, but is -53.3
 or
 &gt; In source file Foo.dsl, definition bla, expression blub: bar must have type Int, but is Bool
 I can achieve this with a ReaderT for the context and ValidationT/ExceptT/whatever for the error, but is there a premade package that does that kind of thing?

 Solution 2: (Generates pascals triangle and then indexes at the (n,k) value)
 import Control.Monad (replicateM_) main :: IO () main &#x3D; readLn &gt;&gt;&#x3D; flip replicateM_ (do l  combinations) where nextRow l@(_:t) &#x3D; 1 : (zipWith f l t) ++ [1] f x y &#x3D; (x + y) &#x60;mod&#x60; (10^8 + 7) 
 Solution 2 gets accepted but Solution 1 gets timedout for 2 test cases. They look and feel exactly the same, so wth is going on? What compiler black magic is under hood for this one?
 Solution 2 literally generates the frikin pascal tree and then indexes into that, shouldn&#x27;t this be slow compared to the bottom up approach which only looks at the previous row entry of size k?

Attribution armored code by Joey Hess
Attribution of source code has been limited to comments, but a deeper embedding of attribution into code is possible. When an embedded attribution is removed or is incorrect, the code should no longer work.

                              <span>This article aims to introduce and explore the practice of splitting debug
symbols away from C/C++ build artifacts to save space and time when building
large codebases. Note that we want to retain access to the debug symbols if and
when they are needed at a later date, hence we don’t want to merely remove
(aka strip) the debug symbols.1
This exploration is largely inspired and based on what I have learned in various
places around the web, most notably:

 class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: var foo: Foo &#x3D; null var bar: Bar &#x3D; null var quz: Quz &#x3D; null var xyzzy: Xyzzy &#x3D; null override def beforeEach(context: BeforeEach): Unit &#x3D; foo &#x3D; Foo() bar &#x3D; Bar(foo) quz &#x3D; bar.getQuz xyzzy &#x3D; Xyzzy(foo, quz) widget &#x3D; Widget(foo, bar) test(&quot;complicated&quot;) { val results &#x3D; widget.doStuff(xyzzy) assertEquals(results, xyzzy + foo.use(bar).use(quz)) } 
 I&#x27;m not seeing a good way to write this with FunFixture My best guess is something like
 class MySuite extends munit.FunSuite: val foo &#x3D; FunFixture[Foo](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Foo()) val bar &#x3D; FunFixture[Bar](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Bar(howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo())) val quz &#x3D; FunFixture[Quz](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; somehowGetBar().getQuz val xyzzy &#x3D; FunFixture[Xyzzy](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Xyzzy(getFoo(), getQuz()) val widget &#x3D; FunFixture[Widget](setup &#x3D; _ &#x3D;&gt; Widget(getFoo(), getBar()) // Make everything into one fixture with some impressively ugly code val everything &#x3D; FunFixture.map2(FunFixture.map2(foo, bar), FunFixture.map3(quz, xyzzy, widget)) // Run the test. Make sure you get the parentheses nesting right! everything.test(&quot;complicated) { ((f, b), (q, x, w)) &#x3D;&gt; val results &#x3D; w.doStuff(x) assertEquals(results, x + f.use(b).use(q)) } 
 By this point, ad-hoc is looking simple and clean. And that&#x27;s assuming that howDoIGetTheValueOfFoo can even be written and doesn&#x27;t make it look even more complicated. And I&#x27;m not even certain you can unwrap the parameters like I did, so there may be more boilerplate just trying to get the actual values out.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a new emacs user and I&#x27;ve been using doom emacs for a while now and i&#x27;m willing to learn Elisp, but found out that it might not be as easy as it might seem at first, because as i found out, lisp is quite different from other programming languages that i&#x27;m used to, especially knowing that i&#x27;m not a programmer by any means and my programming knowledge is very little, not mentioning that elisp is pretty old so the learning resources might not be as much as other more popular programming languages
 so my question is, Is it worth it?
 like what is the level of mastery do i need to achieve to start implementing custom elisp in my configs to enhance my emacs experience?
 and how exactly can i improve my emacs experience if i learned elisp?
 in other words, how rewarding it would be

 Any idea how to fix this without disabling autosaves? It doesn&#x27;t seem to be config problem since same happens with -Q flag.

                              <span>From the launch of the first version of Metanote on iOS to now, it&#x27;s been almost three months, and after several iterations, there have been significant improvements. I believe it&#x27;s essential to update everyone on the progress of Metanote. 
 So far, Metanote has comprehensively supported the customization options for Org mode&#x27;s Agenda view, including settings for tags, properties, subtasks, and most of the major InBufferSettings. I won&#x27;t list them all here, but you can find detailed documentation.
  
InBufferSettings
 Agenda views
 A Simple and Effective GTD Workflow
  
This weekend (November 24-27), I hosted a promotional event. If Metanote has brought convenience and value to your life and work, this might be a good time to get it.
 Upcoming Features:
  
Custom Capture
 Visibility Cycling and Rich Text
 Roam Research and Backlinks
  
Thank you all.

                              <span>I use ripgrep for searching in a project and I want to save the ripgrep buffer with the links.
 Simply saving the buffer just removes the links and leaves only plain text.
 ​
 (The reason for this is, I want to go through several parts of the code which I found with ripgrep. This will take some days, and I want to be able to keep track of my progress by going through the search results and delete the ones I already worked on.)

All of those i&#x27;ll use throughout the day but don&#x27;t do simultaneosly. I&#x27;m trying to set it up so i can save the current state for buffers and open project for work, switch to my org notes, do something there, and switch back with all buffers in place and files open where they where.
 Things like desktop-save-mode seem to handle restoring the last buffers, but aren&#x27;t working for multiple sessions. So what&#x27;s my best bet to have multiple separated &quot;setups&quot; depending on what i&#x27;m working on at the moment?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has been having this issue, but I am getting errors on startup related to auctex when using straight.el. This seems to happen after restarting my computer and the only fix I have, so far, is to delete my straight directory and rebuild all my packages from scratch. On EMACS startup after a restart, I will get an error about the permissions to autogen.sh for Auctex. I tried modifying the permissions in it, and after I get the startup warning...
 error: :pre-build command error in &quot;auctex&quot; recipe in command &quot;(\&quot;./configure\&quot; \&quot;--without-texmf-dir\&quot; \&quot;--with-lispdir&#x3D;.\&quot;)&quot; To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file.

                              <span>To manage packages conveniently, I set new load-path by (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;c:/emacs/.emacs.d/lisp&quot;)
 After that I checked load-path lists through C-h v load-path, which confirms &quot;c:/emacs/.emacs.d/lisp&quot; had been added into load-path lists successfully. Then I run (use-pakage xxx) inside my custom init.el, but a warning occurred said 
  
Error (use-package): Cannot load xxx
  
I rechecked load-path lists and move packages to another one directory mentioned in load-path lists, which is loacted in Emacs installtion directory named site-lisp. THEN (use-pakage xxx) returned to normal and didn&#x27;t rose a warning.
 It&#x27;s so weird, and I just want to set a custom packages load-path. Does anyone know what goes wrong?

                              <span>hi all,
 i have a pretty vanilla vertico configuration
  (use-package vertico :ensure t :config (vertico-mode)) 
 in a directory, i have sub-directories organized like so:
  . |-- dot-emacs.git |-- doomemacs &#x60;-- vanilla.config 
 now, a C-x C-f in the above directory does not display the &#x27;dot-emacs.git&#x27; directory at all.
 how do i fix it ?
 
 thank you !

 If I open them on a different desktop machine they do open the same message, just not on iOS. 
 Is there a way to do this? Maybe using a different program? I am open to anything.

                              <span>Helm-mini enables acting on the file list by using Ctrl-Space to pick those required, though I don&#x27;t know if that is the only action to be done on the selection.
 Is that behaviour unique to helm&#x27;s completing read implementation, or do other such functions exist?
 I need to create an SQL command from a selection from a long list of databases and need something that can pick them individually with highlighting, so once I press Enter, the selection is passed to a function.
 The default completing-read-multiple of typing a match and adding a comma is not suitable for this.
 UPDATE
 After some more searching I&#x27;ve come across this Embark discussion which may help me in what I need. I just need that kind of functionality in a completing-read command, basically something which lets me mark a list of items from a list and apply some arbitrary action to them.

You can get around this by using save-window-excursion; however, I still feel like save-excursion ought to work. Does anyone know why it doesn&#x27;t?
 (You can check this by eval-ing the following in any buffer other than *Messages*: (save-excursion (pop-to-buffer-same-window &quot;*Messages*&quot;)).

                              <span>So I was solving a couple of problems on hackerrank using haskell and I came across a question where the Data.Vector package might be useful. So ideally what I would like is since vector is not available by default, is to install it where ghc and ghci is able to see it and import Data.Vector and :m Data.Vector just works and call it a day. Kind of like in c, where you sudo apt install 
, and #include 
 works.
 Apparently for some reason it seems like a very difficult task to do. Every website/forum which I read suggest to set up a full fledged application with cabal init and then cabal install. 
 I learned that cabal packages and ghc packages are two different things (cabal list --installed and ghc-pkg list). Both maintain their own package databases (installed packages) and ghc and ghci can only see and work with ghc packages. Theres this command cabal install --libs but people on github are saying it can cause some issues and suggest against it (with one person saying it outright &quot;evil&quot;). 
 I couldn&#x27;t find a straightforward solution to this except years old articles and tons of open issues on github with people having similar problems.
 Is there no simple way to achieve this than to manually download or cabal init?

                              <span>As I get deeper into learning haskell I have noticed what seems to be &quot;Imperative Creep&quot; for the lack of a better term.
 It seems as the code gets more &quot;real world&quot; it becomes ever more imperative. In many examples across the web I see code very similar to the imperative style of a language like python. I&#x27;m not really understanding the point of all the great functional aspects of the language if you can&#x27;t write functional code for real world use cases.
 I&#x27;t&#x27;s very confusing for a beginner to wrap their brains around the functional paradigm. Then, almost immediately after understanding this new programming concept you&#x27;re hit with the Monad and all the educational literature starts you a new with imperative code - it&#x27;s maddening. Every tutorial explains that &quot;do&quot; notation makes it easier to grok the monad by allowing a more imperative approach. WTF.
 I&#x27;m not changing any minds for certain. But, honestly I think this &quot;crutch&quot; has hampered my absorption of the learning material and perhaps increased the learning curve. Additionally this also makes the beautiful syntax of haskell look more like some JS crap with all the &quot;do&quot; &quot;if&quot; and &quot;case&quot;, I mean really you can&#x27;t use functors, applicatives or monads with &quot;pattern-matching&quot;, &quot;guards&quot; and &quot;where&quot;. Perhaps I have not learned anything of functional programming?
 I&#x27;m just ranting, apologies for the negative vibes. Probably delete post after some self-reflection.

                              <span>Hello! I have to give a presentation soon about shape-generic code. I’m going to be doing it on the difference between the Foldable class and that mad thing you can do with ~~~ fold :: Bifunctor p &#x3D;&gt; (p a b -&gt; b) -&gt; Fix p a -&gt; b ~~~
 I think I can explain the functions pretty well, but I’d love to have a definition of an F-algebra that someone outside of the abstract-algebra/category theory bubble could grok.
 I should say, I’m also outside of those bubbles and only have a functional understanding of it. I can write you a type which is the F-algebra of another with no idea of what that means, only why I’d want to!

So... Hello! I am Fernando Nóbel :-)
I am Spanish. Still, I work in Belgium as a post-doctoral researcher in control engineering applied to synthetic biology and bioprocesses. My passions are reading, learning, and creating. I also write online about productivity, creativity, and writing. You can find my writings on my web (https://eljardindegestalt.com/).
I have participated in the ZK101 workshop with Sascha, I use Vim (with minimal plug-ins and configuration) for my Zettelkasten, and the size of my Zettelkasten reached 1.000 notes recently.
If you want to use Vim for your Zettelkasten, or if you have any other questions,  feel free to ask me anything 
See you around!</span>

What really got me into emacs was the interaction with the python repl. It was amazing. Only Jupyter notebooks did something similar for me. Lately I have been using VScode, as the notebook experience for data science is very good and emacs cannot really compete here as notebooks are web based since the beggining, and vscode is an electron app. Packages like ein was just an ok replacement. Also I have been using logseq instead of org-mode, as the android app is very good and allow me to add stuff from the camera and using the pen with the whiteboard. I am mainly using org-mode to define large project files and leaving logseq for note taking.

                              <span>Have been using emacs for a while now with doom and have a question to the community:
 When you have a project inside of docker with packages instead by pip, how to you have your eMacs and LSP resolve the import statements?
 I have heard of TRAMP but this seems like a solution for jacking into a docker container that is running to just modify files. 
 Thanks, Aaron

                              <span>I added an embark config from: https://karthinks.com/software/fifteen-ways-to-use-embark/#open-any-buffer-by-splitting-any-window, which works really good, the only problem is that if a file is opened with project-find-file-in, it doesn&#x27;t respect its own directory.
 Steps: 1. When the default-directory set to ~/, M-x browse-emacs-config to open a file list of ~/.config/emacs in the minibuffer 2. embark-act on a file lisp/init-lib.el 3. o and b to open the selected file horizontally 4. A buffer opened on the right side, but the directory is still using the default-directory in step 1 instead of the buffer&#x27;s directory, causing the buffer to visit ~/lisp/init-lib.el instead of ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-lib.el.
 Config:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (defun find-file-in-project (&amp;optional dir) (interactive) (let ((project (project-current nil dir))) (project-find-file-in nil nil project)))
 (defun browse-emacs-config () (interactive) (find-file-in-project &quot;~/.config/emacs&quot;))
 (eval-when-compile (defmacro my/embark-aw-action (fn) &#x60;(defun ,(intern (concat &quot;my/embark-aw-&quot; (symbol-name fn))) () ,(format &quot;Open %s buffer selected with ace-window&quot; (symbol-name fn)) (interactive) (with-demoted-errors &quot;%s&quot; (require &#x27;ace-window) (let ((aw-dispatch-always t)) (aw-switch-to-window (aw-select nil)) (call-interactively (symbol-function &#x27;,fn)))))))
 (define-key embark-file-map (kbd &quot;o&quot;) (my/embark-aw-action find-file)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>It happens pretty often that I want to compute something with numbers that are between two extremes. For example, if a thing will cost between 100 and 120€ and I will need to buy betwen 2 and 4 of them, then it will cost  *  &#x3D; .
 A few times, I would like to do that with probability distributions. It&#x27;s rarer, but if I had a handy tool, I&#x27;d do that a lot of times.
 A range or a distribution could not have a valid Num instance (mostly because it has no notion of sign), but it could have a perfectly valid Field instance. Is there such a library already?

                              <span>Hello! I am fairly new to Haskell. After years of lurking into it, but scared with the syntax and so many abstractions, it was watching the first series of lectures of Cateogory Theory for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski what made me decide to start. As a mathematitian, his explanations made me very excited. I am reading some books and following at the same time this MOOC. 
 Ok, so my question is the following. I am doing the exercises of the MOOC and in one of them I am asked to do this:
  
Implement a type class Cycle that contains a function step that cycles through the values of the type.
 
Implement instances for Color and Suit that work like this:
  
step Red &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Green
 step Green &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Blue
 step Blue &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Red
 
  
The suit instance should cycle suits in the order Club, Spade, Diamond,…</span>

                              <span>I would like to sync my .org files to my website&#x27;s server in order to do the following: Every x minutes, it takes all my org files as an input and generates an .ics file which my calendar apps (on my phone, tablet, desktop, etc...) can pull to sync themselves.
 It feels kinda bloated to install a fully fledged emacs onto a small server where I only have about 50Gb of storage only to generate calendar files. Is there a way to:
  
Install only the tool that generates .ics files
 Automate it to run at a regular interval (whithout user intervention) with a crontab.
  
Thanks folks! :)
 FYI: I don&#x27;t mind that the .ics is public. I don&#x27;t store any confidential info in my tasks ;)

                              <span>I have a complex subquery (written in slick), that has a distinct on primary key tuple in it: select distinct on (intId, strId) ... from table where ....
 I also need to sort the resulting set using arbitrary columns/set of columns, so to accomplish this i would write sth like select * from(select distinct on (intId, strId) ... from table where ...) order by ....
 How do I do that in slick? Were it not for the composite primary key I would write table.filter(_.id in subQuery).sortBy(...). I don&#x27;t want to include a sorted column in a depends on clause because that might tank performance quite a lot.

                              <span>Hello all, I would like to implore the gurus around here, could you show me some magic to make this declaration shorter?
 I have this code: ~~~ getSearchV2 a &#x3D; withRequestEncrypted a proc
 where
 proc :: ProcEncrypted {} (Array Int)
 proc c b zgCode cred &#x3D; do
 pure $ Just [12]
 ~~~
 It would be nice if I can make it like this: ~~~ getSearchV2 a &#x3D; withRequestEncrypted a $ \c b zgCode cred -&gt; do
 pure $ Just [12] ~~~
 but I got the error: ~~~ The inferred type 
 forall t274. ReadForeign t274 &#x3D;&gt; Config -&gt; Context -&gt; Effect Unit 
 has type variables which are not determined by those mentioned in the body of the type: 
 t274 could not be determined 
 Consider adding a type annotation.
 ~~~
 I suppose ReadForeign comes from the definition of ProcEncrypted. So the question is: - How should I annotate the type ProcEncrypted {} (Array Int) ? - Is this can be used for forall a b. ProcEncrypted a b ?
 Thank you very much for your kind responses dear Gurus, may your light shone brighter and clearer everyday...

                              <span>I hope my question makes sense.
 I am using Doom Emacs for a while now and have become fairly proficient. But I feel like whenever I am browsing emacs content online there are still many topics for me to discover. So I was wondering if there is anything that I might be &quot;missing&quot; yet which might help with my productivity or improve my development skills.
 Sofar I what have learned, on top from my head:
  
Org/Org Agenda (refile etc.)
 Magit
 Vterm
 LSP Commands
 Multiple Cursors
 Literal Config
 Navigating Emacs itself (which key, debugging, reading Emacs-Lisp (abit))
 Using Language specific commands, i.e. send buffer to repl 
 Using Undo with Vundo
  
Only thing I know that I still need to learn is beeing more proficient with vim keybindings, but with that I know where to start.
 I know the question is quite broad, but maybe there some &quot;killer features&quot; worth to explore which I am not aware of yet.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any input.

 As the title says, when Eglot is trying to connect to the server, I get a jsonrpc error:  [client-reply] (id:0) ERROR Mon Nov 20 09:19:00 2023: (:jsonrpc &quot;2.0&quot; :id 0 :error) (:code -32603 :message &quot;Internal error&quot;))  I so far haven&#x27;t found any solutions on how to fix this.

                              <span>Neo emacs is a configuration for GNU Emacs which is based on doom emacs and focuses on the java web application coding environment. Here is a detailed tutorial to teach you how to install doom emacs for beginners. And here have many common configurations for beginners too.
 ![img](https://github.com/sincebyte/neo-emacs/blob/master/image-use.png) 
 Neo emacs has the following features:
  
Code completion: Lsp-java supports maven and gradle project.
 Http client: Rest-client is a tool to manually explore and test HTTP REST webservices just like Postman.
 SQL client: Ejc-sql turns Emacs into a simple SQL client which supports various databases.
 Redis client: Eredis Non-blocking Redis client with focus on performance and robustness.
 Terminal emulator: Emacs-libvterm (vterm) is fully-fledged terminal emulator inside GNU Emacs based on libvterm.
 Knowledge management system: Org-roam borrows principles from the Zettelkasten method, providing a solution for non-hierarchical note-taking.
 doomorgstyle: An org html style template similar to doom doc.
  
Here I follow the rules, Try to keep the configuration of doom and enhance it. As a veteran, you may not use neo emacs directly. But the configuration here may also be useful to you! Thanks for the support!

 In this Screenshot you see the frames of two Emacs processes. The left frame has been started by emacs -q, while the right frame has been started by emacs -Q. So no personal configuration (besides .Xresources) is used. The version is Emacs 29.1., X11, Linux.
 The left frame shows the font I&#x27;d like to use, and used since many years with Emacs already. But the left frame also shows a &quot;distorted&quot; display of example characters. The important character is …. It is clearly visible in this screenshot, that Emacs changes the font (glyph?) to display this character if the character needs to be rendered in bold.

                              <span>Hey, I was working on this one off and on for a few days after briefly trying out skeleton-mode, yasnippet, and some other stuff, and not really being too happy with them. I find that I have a lot of repetitive editing tasks where I need to do something to a small block of code a lot, but in the process change some names or values in a way that&#x27;s just a little bit different each time. Normally this is where people would start to reach for yasnippet and auto-yasnippet, which is fine if that works for them, but personally that&#x27;s just a bit more heavyweight and powerful than what I normally need. What I wanted was just a way to enhance a regular Emacs keyboard macro to support that sort of thing, so I wrote this. If it helps you too, wonderful!

 Note: Someone asked a very similar question earlier. I am curious about the same thing, but I wanted to ask the question with a more polite tone.

                              <span>No, it&#x27;s not a troll post.
 I just spent an hour in a tute with our lecturer trying to honestly convince us that emacs/orgmode is literally the best tool for everything ever. Even after someone asked him to add an image to his little demo and it took literally FIVE MINUTES and then he cant even format it or move it on the page.
 Every Youtube tutorial is the same - people typing and typing and tying for 20 minutes at a time to do what I can on my phone in literally 30 seconds. Endless Endless ENDLESS obscure shortcuts and menus inside menus beneath submenus - all with no intuitive or conceptual link to navigate between disconnected dumps of unformatted text.
 Even within a single page, theres never anything resembling a visual cue to explain what youre doing to what. And even when you do figure out what one peice of random highlighting means, you can&#x27;t get anywhere without typing MORE obscure &quot;shortcuts&quot;. HOW is this better than point and click? Who in their right mind would abandon ~30 years of interface progress for this demonstrably worse navigation method?
 I WOULD say it&#x27;s the worst UX I&#x27;ve ever seen on any utility, ever - except there literally is not UX . All you end up with, everywhere, is a nigh-on-useless bricks of text, only clumsily navigated through with MORE STUPID SHORTCUTS . How anyone could be expected to manage anything with this is beyond all of us.
 Now he expects us to bring lesson summaries to the tute every week in this incomprehensible garbage, and literally NOBODY in the class has ANY idea how to organise anything in what as far as we can tell is just a glorified notepad, or why it even exits.
 What am I missing?
 EDIT: Well, from the look of the downvotes and cope in the comments, this is going to be one of THOSE &quot;open source&quot; communities. So I think I&#x27;ll drop the course for something useful instead. Thanks!

                              <span>The title pretty much says it all, but here’s the verbose bit.
 I’m storing all of my Ansible playbooks in an Org doc, with each play getting its own separate heading. Ansible requires a name for each play, and I’m already naming the heading, so I’m attempting to save a touch of typing.
 What I have:
 * Disable screen locking #+begin_src yaml - name: Disable screen locking community.general.dconf: key: &quot;/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled&quot; value: &quot;false&quot; state: present #+end_src 
 What I’m aiming for, that when tangled, comes as out as above:
 * Disable screen locking #+begin_src yaml - name: $HEADING community.general.dconf: key: &quot;/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled&quot; value: &quot;false&quot; state: present #+end_src

                              <span>Apologies if the following seems dumb. I’m trying to figure something out with cats-effect-3 and scala. I have the following class structure:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; trait Resource { def execute(): F[Output] }
 class A[F[_]] extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] &#x3D; ??? }
 class B[F[_]](a: A[F]) extends Resource { override def execute(): F[Output] &#x3D; { a.execute().flatMap(…) } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Each Resource type has an execute method whose output I want to memoize. So that dependent classes (there may be a third class C that can call a.execute) may call it multiple times in any order but they will all get the same value as a result. This would be pretty straightforward with scala’s Future (if I use It instead of F).
 I‘ve seen Async.memoize. However, that changes the signature to F[F[Output]] and I can only execute the “outer” flatMap once, or the results are re-calculated. In this case, I’m not sure how I would allow the dependent classes to use the memoized output.
 I’m relatively new to the Typelevel ecosystem, and I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this correctly. How would I modify the code such that my effect gets executed only once, no matter how many times I call it?
 Should I use the non-typelevel concurrency primitives to handle this outside the effect-system and then wrap it in F?
 I know I can probably orchestrate the “graph” of execution without having each dependent class doing this. But I need to chain the calls these way for the time being.
 ——
 UPDATE [2023/11/20]: For now, I’m going with an AtomicCell that wraps an Option value, and setting it to Some if it’s None (the initial value) using evalUpdateAndGet. This doesn’t seem very elegant though.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been messing around with HTTP4s and Cats and realised that I can only run 3rd party libraries by compiling them with SBT and then running them. I cant run them directly from vscode using Metal. I looked around and found a way to run the libraries directly but it only works with Scala worksheets.
 This is an example of what was used.
 import $dep.&#x60;org.typelevel::cats-core:2.10.0&#x60;
 ​
 But I want to know how I could import and run 3rd party libraries directly from vscode without getting the error &quot;Cats not found&quot;

                              <span>I am confused of what the workflow when developing with Haskell is these days.
 For example I am not sure whether I should from the very beginning of a project have a .cabal file, i.e. whether I should start all projects by running cabal init first. Shouldn&#x27;t building a package be one of the last steps in a project?
 What do people do if they, say only want to try out a package? With python for example you would probably create a virtual environment, install the package in it, import it in your source file and go.
 The analog to that solution would be sandboxes I assume, but as far as I understand those are depreciated these days.
 I used Haskell ~3 years ago, always installed packages globally, and then worked mainly with ghci. This was probably not ideal back then, but seems to not even work quite the same way today (cabal install 
 says 
 is not exposed or something along these lines).
 From what I read here, it seems that a &quot;python like workflow&quot; maybe works when working with nix (instead of cabal?).
 Can somebody help lift my confusion? I find it very difficult to get started with Haskell these days, bc I find the tooling and the documentation really confusing.

                              <span>I&#x27;m attempting to make a minimal JSON validation thing to work with aeson like so (relevant bits):
 -- the (-.) is just a flipped (.) ensure :: (Validation v, ValType v ~ a) &#x3D;&gt; Parser a -&gt; v -&gt; Parser a ensure parser validator &#x3D; (parser &gt;&gt;&#x3D; validate validator -. maybe (fail $ errMsg validator) pure) &#x60;parserCatchError&#x60; \path _ -&gt; do let !_ &#x3D; traceShowId @JSONPath path undefined class Validation v where type ValType v validate :: v -&gt; ValType v -&gt; Maybe (ValType v) errMsg :: v -&gt; String data NotBlank &#x3D; NotBlank instance Validation NotBlank where type ValType NotBlank &#x3D; Text validate _ txt &#x3D; guard (not $ T.null txt) $&gt; txt errMsg _ &#x3D; &quot;can&#x27;t be blank&quot; 
 and with basic usage like so:
 newtype Action &#x3D; Action { body :: Text } deriving (Show) instance FromJSON Action where parseJSON &#x3D; withObject &quot;Action&quot; $ \v -&gt; Action  v .: &quot;body&quot; &#x60;ensure&#x60; NotBlank 
 which is all fine and dandy but when it does fail from my own manual fail calls, it doesn&#x27;t pass the JSONPath to the error handler
 λ&gt; eitherDecode @Action &quot;{ \&quot;body\&quot;: 3 }&quot; [Key &quot;body&quot;] λ&gt; eitherDecode @Action &quot;{ \&quot;body\&quot;: \&quot;\&quot; }&quot; [] -- No path to be seen :( 
 I know I could manually pass in the key/path to the validation types (like v .: &quot;body&quot; &#x27;ensure&#x27; NotBlank &quot;body&quot;), but like, that takes extra characters to write, and I don&#x27;t have the time for that :)
 I&#x27;ve tried looking around but there&#x27;s basically zero info on this sort of thing. Any suggestions/solutions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m continuing my journey with Haskell.
 The question is:
 Am I right, despite a huge functionality included in the base, Haskell doesn&#x27;t have a simple State Monad, encapsulating s -&gt; (a, s) in the Base?
 To cope with that, I added mtl 2.3.1 and imported Control.Monad.State 
 Maybe I&#x27;m missing something?

 So this is probably naive question, but have to ask it because I need an advice. It is a longer post, so if you do not want to read it all, just check the bold text.
 3 weeks ago I started with Haskell. I do not have a background in CS and my job is CS/IT unrelated. I program since elementary school (I&#x27;m now 36) and do it as a hobby and for fun. I use Ruby and Javascript/Typescript, with some quite limited experience in C++. I did try with Haskell before, like in 3-4 occasions (for the first time more than 10 years ago), but usually I just gave up (primary because of lack time and the things were going slow, so I just lose motivation and interest).
 Now I want to do the right thing and push it all the way to the &quot;end&quot; (&#x3D;&#x3D; actually write something, then improve it further by pra…</span>

                              <span>New to the world of zettelkasten and could use some guidance about my zettels. So what Ive done here is I created my first 3 zettels out of a reference note from this article: https://ckrybus.com/static/papers/luhmann1981.pdf supplemented with the translation from sacha on this website since my German is &quot;meh&quot; at best.
The first 2 share some overlap, don&#x27;t know if I should combine them. Tried to stay true to the 1 idea per note thing. All tips are welcome so dont hold back!

Communication with a zettelkasten favors an open system without hierarchy, structure and/or order, but instead focuses on making connections. While communicating with your zettelkasten the openness could lead to unexpected connections/insight. This is were the power of the zettelkasten lies.

I&#x27;ve been using Logseq for some time but find the interface too sluggish. I found &quot;ekg&quot; emacs plugin but it&#x27;s missing a few features to replace Logseq. I would like for all my notes to be combined into a single graph where they can be directly edited/manipulated without having to open up another buffer. Any other plugins aside from ekg that would give me a Logseq-like experience? (no org-mode, no note titles) Thanks!

                              <span>I am 100 % a keyboard only user, but sometimes i want to relax and browse dired only with one hand. But the standart behaviour of dired , when clicking on files or directories, is really ass. Thus i wrote some code to gain this functionality:
 Left-Mouse-Click: The same as Pressing Enter
 Right-Mouse-Click: close current buffer and go to last visible buffer
 ​
 thus you can left click on entry, then go back with right click which is super fast and handy. Try it out !!!
 (I am using evil, but you can easily bind the keys with :
 (define-key dired-mode-map .... )
 code:
 ​
 (defun my/dired-jump (event)
 (interactive &quot;e&quot;)
 (mouse-drag-region event)
 (dired-find-file))
 ​
 (defun my/dired-jump-close ()
 (interactive)
 (kill-current-buffer))
 ​
 (evil-global-set-key &#x27;normal (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/dired-jump-close)
 ​
 (evil-define-key &#x27;(normal visual motion emacs) dired-mode-map
 (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/dired-jump)

 helm-projectile-ag is my current grepping tool but doesn&#x27;t seem to offer such a facility, unless I haven&#x27;t read the docs well enough.
 My issues are:
  
It can present a lot of hits in the same file it but lists each one separately. A good option would be to fold the output when there are multiple matches, then I can use the Tab keep to expand the fold and scan through the previews and even edit them right away.
 
The search panel is modal. It doesn&#x27;t create a result buffer which you can save and then return to later to continue to select files to edit. Once you lose focus it is gone. It doesn&#x27;t even seem to retain the search term so you can use it later.
 
It would be nice to have a window that shows the actual CLI command passed to the search utility. I see them once in a while but it would be good to show them up front or make them easily accessible.
 
 Do any of the project grep tools or helm-projectile-ag itself offer such features?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I&#x27;m mostly a Java dev who ran into Scala 2 a few years back and now I wanted to try out version 3, just for fun. My IDE of choice is IntelliJ, so I tried to make it work there, but so far, not very successfully.
 The first attempt was &quot;the way I know&quot; - build using Maven and use the IntelliJ Scala plugin for everything. But there was basically no help from the IDE (no autocomplete etc.).
 So I tried doing it &quot;the Scala way&quot; - installed SBT, created a project using the official guide, imported as a BSP project into Intellij using this guide and everything seemed to work - I can run the thing at least :-)
 But when I try to Ctrl+Click something from the standard library (like Seq or max on an Iterable), the IDE navigates to sources of 2.13 instead of 3.3.1. I tried enabling the BSP logs and the classpath SBT is returning is something like
 [ &quot;file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/classes/&quot;, &quot;file:~/IdeaProjects/my_project/target/scala-3.3.1/test-classes&quot;, &quot;file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala3-library_3/3.3.1/scala3-library_3-3.3.1.jar&quot;, &quot;file:~/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.10/scala-library-2.13.10.jar&quot; ] 
 is it OK that it&#x27;s sending both Scala 2 and 3 jars? How can I make IntelliJ go to the Scala 3 stdlib on Ctrl+click?
 I&#x27;m sure I must be doing a simple msitake somewhere, but I&#x27;m out of ideas what to try. I already tried creating a new project from scratch, updating Intellij to the latest version, reinstalling SBT, nothing helps...
 Thanks in advance for any help or pointers!

                              <span>Hello there! I am playing around with Scala 3 inline features and trying to implement some compile-time safe things. Now I am wondering, is there any way to proof that if N &gt;&#x3D; 0, then S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 in compile-time? I.e. can I derive an instance of S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true from the instance of N &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true?
 I&#x27;ve tried a naive way to implement this using inline given:  inline given snGeq[N &#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true): (S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true) &#x3D; summonInline  however the compiler cannot type check it in case when I try to use this implicit on type level, e.g. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import scala.compiletime.ops.int.* import scala.compiletime.*
 inline given snGeq[N &#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true): (S[N] &gt;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true) &#x3D; summonInline
 sealed trait SizedList[+A, Size &#x3D; 0 &#x3D;:&#x3D; true) case object SNil extends SizedList[Nothing, 0] case class SCons[+A, TailSize &lt;: Int](head: A, tail: SizedList[A, TailSize]) extends SizedList[A, S[TailSize]] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; does not type check.

  if (whatever &#x3D;&#x3D; -1) 
 it won&#x27;t auto-indent the next line unless I use braces {} with the if statement, even if there is just one statement with a semi-colon after the if. Also, as I&#x27;m typing, it weirdly indents my functions as I type them.
 Any way to fix these?

                              <span>Aside from new language sources that the community can contribute at any time, this package feels more or less feature complete now.
 v1.0.0 on GitHub
 For those who don&#x27;t know, treesit-auto enables automatic detection, installation, and usage of tree-sitter grammars and modes in Emacs 29+. Vanilla Emacs exposes some variables and functions that facilitate this behavior, but without treesit-auto it&#x27;s up to you to check when tree-sitter is available and configure how Emacs behaves when it is (or isn&#x27;t). This package takes that work away from you and is designed to fit what the vast majority of users would expect from automatic use of tree-sitter in Emacs.
 This started out as just my own configuration to treesit-language-source-alist, major-mode-remap-alist, and auto-mode-alist, but now has a lot of features that didn&#x27;t exist just under a year ago when I first announced it.
  
Automatic detection and installation for built-in tree-sitter modes, such as rust-ts-mode, yaml-ts-mode, toml-ts-mode, typescript-ts-mode, and go-ts-mode. You can get this behavior through the treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist function (the name is too long...I know)
 Less buggy behavior overall, such as ensuring we switch to the tree-sitter mode after installing it
 Detecting and installing grammars required by the current mode, such as TypeScript and TSX requiring each other
  
This package isn&#x27;t perfect. It&#x27;s honestly still a bit of a hack, and many parts of the code are too clever for my own liking. It does its job, though, and I&#x27;ve been a happy, daily user of it for the last 9 months or so. Of course, a big thank you to all who have supported the project and contributed to it along the way!

 Is there a way to shorten them or have just the name of the bookmark/file show up in the dashboard?
 Sorry if noob question but I am a noob.

Is something like this allready in existance or does it have to be writen based on the calc code?

                              <span>Hey hey.
 I use the heck out of tuedachu/ytdl. One thing I would like to improve about it is that when you queue a download with ytdl-download it appears to be a synchronous call and it freezes emacs until youtube-dl/yt-dlp is able to start the actual download.
 I&#x27;ve yet to dive into the code to see what synchronous function is being called -- I&#x27;m very aware of the &quot;single-threaded&quot; nature of Emacs -- but I use other libraries that are likely shelling and they do not hang like this and so I would like to see if there&#x27;s a way to I can bring whatever technique they are using over to a PR against tuedachu/ytdl.
 Appreciate any advice from the crew here.

                              <span>Hi everyone. So im new to emacs and im currently using doom emacs on my laptop.
 Everything is working fine, but today i decided to install it on my desktop. Im using all the settings from my laptop, but for some reason when i press enter on a link for example, emacs just goes down a line similiar to me pressing the down arrow/j key. This happens on all the links.
 Any idea what the issue could be? This doesnt happen on my laptop
 Edit: Just to clarify, clicking on the link with my mouse works normally.
 Edit 2: Okay so apparently i needed to just do a doom sync since no profile was loaded i think. It said &quot;generating profile&quot; and now it works :) Noob misstake, but ill let this post still be here if anyone runs into the same problem in the future

                              <span>I would like to share with you a new Emacs package called project-tasks that I had been working on. With project-tasks, you can effortlessly manage tasks within your project using the power of org-babel.
 You can take a look here https://github.com/TxGVNN/project-tasks
 I developed and use it a long time, and it helps me a lot of to manage tasks I need to run on a project.
 Example: tasks.org
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +name: docker-compose up
 +begin_src compile :name &quot;docker-compose-up&quot; :results none
 docker-compose up -d
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 You can see more examples in tasks.org on repository.

                              <span>Hi all!
 This is mostly the question. I decided to give to lsp-bridge a chance, but I am having this issue with Corfu. 
 https://preview.redd.it/vh8ku4xru31c1.png?width&#x3D;629&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;3a69667f9c63b6948e0b91ad2ea8254b27ff3524
 I installed Corfu using this PR in doom https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/pull/7002
 I would like to use lsp-bridge when there is an LSP server available, but Corfu otherwise (minibuffer, plain text, etc.). Moreover, I tried this, but it didn&#x27;t work:
 (add-hook! &#x27;lsp-bridge-mode-hook (lambda () (corfu-mode -1))) 
 Thanks for your assistance!

 End EDIT
 ----
 as mind map user I like to jot idea with parent, children, sibling hierarchy.
 I am not satisfied with the present method of creating the three above as need to do a lot of adjustments ex option+ enter to create a new sibiling then ,Shift+ to adapt the sibiling as a parent or sub. As I am in a creative process would like a faster way to achieve this.
 For long list of sibilings I resolved writing in plain text the list and then shift+V and jjjj to select the list and then i launch toggle-heading, but this does not work if I add myself spaces in the plain text.
 Please do you know a fast way to open a parent/children/sibiling node, I see a shortcut could be a solution, but do not know if is a good idea because should combine more commands

                              <span>I have a number of edits I need to do to yaml files. I&#x27;d like to drive emacs in the following way: mapcar over a list calling a function that opens a file, searches for a match, switches to interactive mode so I can adjust point, inserts some pre-formatted data specific to the match, allows me to edit the insertion to fix the inevitable typos that exist and, when I&#x27;m ready, saves the file and moves to the next element. I&#x27;m automating the file and buffer navigation as well as the content insertion but doing precise placement and editing by hand. Sadly, I did this once previously years ago but I don&#x27;t remember how.
 Relevant rant: this stupidity&#x27;s only necessary because yaml&#x27;s flexibility for too many ways to do the same thing so reading the yaml in, adjusting the data structures and writing it back out make pull requests horrific as minute semantic changes can have massive syntactic ones.

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Workouts and exercise programs for a 67-year-old who wants his final decade to be active.
I&#x27;m tweaking my ZK Dashboard. I&#x27;m trimming information that is distracting and reformating some, so it is more engaging. This is an iterative process. This work fits my personality.
I&#x27;m seriously thinking of restarting my ZK fresh. So far, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits, but the difference is getting closer to a tipping point.

 do return 4 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print 
 However, I was surprised to find that this works just as well:
 do return 4 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print 
 Naively, since both lines are at the same indent level, I expected this code to be equivalent to do { return 4; &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print } which does not typecheck, as expected. 
 Apparently, the correct equivalence is do { return 4 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print }. It seems that the two separate lines have been treated as one, despite being at the same indent level in a do block.
 What is the rule that governs this?

                              <span>I sometimes run into this slightly annoying situation when I&#x27;m building up a programme, in which I would like to eliminate, add, or swap arguments around in a function definition.
 I&#x27;m going to talk about this from the perspective of this simple set of definitions:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; newtype Person &#x3D; Person { name :: Text } data Lang &#x3D; EN | FR
 hello :: Lang -&gt; Text hello EN &#x3D; &quot;hello&quot; hello FR &#x3D; &quot;salut&quot;
 greet :: Person -&gt; Lang -&gt; Text greet person lang &#x3D; hello lang  &quot; &quot;  name person &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Let&#x27;s take the Helix editor (which I&#x27;m playing with as my daily driver). It&#x27;s annoying because, even if I use the treesitter integration to, say, select the object, delete it, move to the other side of the arrow, and paste it in, I still have to go and write/delete a load of -&gt;. Admittedly, this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but I remember when I was playing with clojure many years ago in vim, and I sort of loved the ability, via vim-sexp, to move things around -- into lists, out of lists, forward and backwards within a list, etc..
 I was therefore thinking: &quot;I wonder if it&#x27;s possibly to do this in my editor&quot;, and wanted to start with something as simple as &quot;can I move the argument backwards / forwards&quot;, by which I mean, with respect to the greet function defined above: &quot;can I swap the Person and Lang arguments so instead of greet myPerson EN I do greet EN myPerson?&quot;
 I thought maybe treesitter would be a nice way to achieve this, but I really have no idea where to start (and if there is a better way). Any ideas?

                              <span>Except for popular libraries. Most of the libraries have insufficient or no documention / tutorial at all. For other programming languages such as Java/Python, one will find many blogs/tutorials/docs on almost all fields. While for Haskell there are not even YouTube videos of &quot;How to do&quot;.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>This is a bit off-topic because it&#x27;s not necessarily using Haskell but it&#x27;s connected enough that I hope it&#x27;s ok that I post here.
 I&#x27;d like to write proofs about category theory, and I&#x27;d like to mechanize them, so that the compiler/type checker will check the proofs for me. Think, for example, of writing the proofs for the usual exercises you find in category theory books (e.g., from Benjamin Pierce&#x27;s book, page 35, &quot;Show that in any Cartesian closed category, B{AxA&#x27;} is isomorphic to (BA )A&#x27;&quot;, or page 41, &quot;Show that if an F-algebra (F a) is initial in the category F-Alg [defined before] then a is an isomorphism&quot;).
 What would be good languages to write such proofs? Idris? Lean? Agda?

                              <span>i&#x27;m pretty sure i&#x27;m overthinking this but why does doom emacs have
 SPC-c c for compiling
 and SPC-c C for recompiling
 i thought it should&#x27;ve been other way round as i generally put the command for compiling and then just keep recompiling repeatedly and i believe doing SPC-c c is faster than pressing SPC-c C
 ​
 when so you either have four keys to press by doing SPC-c c  to recompile
 or you have to press four keys by doing SPC-c c assuming you press shift for C
 what i prefer doing is using SPC-c c for recompiling only three keys to press 
 and SPC-c c for compiling normally
 ​
 it&#x27;s just a little thing annoying me whenever i go from one config of doom emacs to another
 every person i&#x27;ve seen doesn&#x27;t reconfigure this. but they do seem to be bothered by this they do realize how annoying it is but don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle to remap that
 ​
 what do you guys think am i too paranoid about this is my OCD kicking in or do you feel the same ?

                              <span>I just installed emacs for Android from the fdroid store. I do not see a way for me to grant storage access to my local device. Without that permission, I don&#x27;t see how I can edit files, particularly org files, on my local device
 I will put a screenshot of my apps permissions in a comment.

 I switched to guix as the package manager following system-crafters tutorial. I have correct setup the PATH variable so that binaries from guix are accessible, but still magit is not able find emacsclient even though it is there and I can launch it from shell. No changes to the configure has been made. Used to work this morning but after removing apt emacs and installing emacs via guix I get this issue.
 Config:
  (use-package magit :bind ((&quot;C-c g&quot; . #&#x27;magit-status)))

                              <span>I&#x27;m putting the output of M-x grep in an org src block, so I can save it and come back to it later. I want to be able to click on a line and jump to the match, but I get the error &quot;No org-babel-execute function for grep!&quot;. I can&#x27;t find anything like ob-grep. Any ideas?

 Killing the buffer and reopening the file lets me update the table once.
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>emacs noob here.
 I&#x27;m rewriting my init.el file from scratch using use-package macro. In my existing init file I use require to configure MELPA package archive. 
 (require &#x27;package)
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;MELPA&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 (package-initialize)
 Can I rewrite this using use-package macro?

                              <span>hi fellow r/emacs ers,
 I use org-attach a lot in my notes. And I also have a default temp folder on my disk where everything I collect lands in (created automatically by emacs at startup, using the date as variable for its name).
 When I try to attach a file using org-attach, the default folder shown is the root of my note folder, it varies according to the notes.
 What can I do to have my default temp directory (created using &#x27;(make-directory mydailytempdir)&#x27; ) to be the first goal shown when opening an &#x27;org-attach&#x27; process looking for new attachments?
 I tried to look into the elisp file &#x27;org-attach.el&#x27;, but my elisp-fu is not good enough...
 I guess using embark could help, but it would add many keypresses... I&#x27;d like to avoid it.
 is there a way to have a selection of path to choose from when opening org-attach (that could be defined in the init.el)??
 thanks for your time and replies

                              <span>Still on Emacs 27.1. I&#x27;m sure this behaviour is recent and has not always been the case. At startup my after-save-hook is nil. When I first open an org file this changes to (rmail-after-save-hook) despite not using rmail. This is normal though based on this answer from Eli. In other org buffers the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t) whether under version control or not as global-diff-mode is enabled. For python files the (buffer local) value is (diff-hl-update t ws-butler-after-save) as ws-butler-mode is enabled in the prog-mode-hook. What am I missing that could cause this behaviour? It is occurring irrespective of the buffer and only if there are changes to be saved.

That is I wanting buffers that I don&#x27;t have to name or explicitly save that will still be there if emacs (or computer itself) are restarted.

It unifies several existing ML Frameworks and new Microsoft algorithms in a single, scalable API that is usable across Python, R, Scala, and Java. SynapseML is usable from any Apache Spark platform (or even your laptop) and is now generally available with enterprise support on Microsoft Fabric.

                              <span>Say I&#x27;m using Shardcake 2.1.1 which has a dependency on Caliban 2.4.0, which has zio-http 3.0.0-RC2 as a dependency.
 In the same app I want to also use zio-http 3.0.0-RC3 directly for an API, and want that version specifically because it has some features I really want (namely the new routes DSL). It&#x27;s compiling just fine, but I&#x27;m getting run time errors:
 java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information: localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:8087 
 Is there a way to handle this without having to fork and/or compile my own versions of Shardcake and Caliban locally until a release or snapshot is made with zio-http-RC3 (or some other future version that has the features I want)? I think I remember having a similar issue in the past because I wanted to use tapir with Caliban and each had a dependency on a different version of zio-http... I got it to compile and then run by breaking up the project into several sub-projects making sure there were no overlaps in dependencies, but this was kind of unwieldy considering it was a fairly small project, so I&#x27;d rather not do that again.
 Do correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but from what I&#x27;ve read this isn&#x27;t an Scala-only thing and also affects Java, so I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a commonly known workaround for this that I don&#x27;t know of (maybe some eviction policies in the sbt file, or in Java&#x27;s case pom file?).

This one is an atomized idea from my reading of _Manguel, Alberto. A history of reading. 2014. _ It is longish at 436 words and includes AI help with translation, a Wikipedia link, the relevant quote, and my assimilation into my ZK. With your help, it can be improved.
The content of this note might be of interest to those who like to follow the history of what has evolved to become the ZKM.
Let me know what you think of the form and the content of this note. Do you have any questions? I frantically created it yesterday. The energy of the idea was brain-boffing, mind-mashing, and the incarnation of amazing.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve had an interesting opportunity to talk to some engineers at Bloomberg and learnt that some teams are using Haskell in production! 
 I&#x27;ve also learnt they are actively hiring (Bloomberg in general) but at least for entry level positions there is a team matching where you can find a team that uses Haskell in production.
 Thought it might be interesting to some other Haskell fans in search of jobs! :)

Announcing conformance by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
This post announces the conformance library factored out from ical. It implements RFC 2119 in order to help you write implementations for other specifications. The conformance library exists to let you write a single parser that you can then run in multiple modes: strict and lenient.

A mess of cables and knobs
I used to play piano as a kid.
As a teenager, I became frustrated by the limitations of the instrument and started getting into synthesizers.
That was a thrilling experience. Being able to turn a few knobs and get a totally different — and brand new — sound was an amazing feeling.
But it was also frustrating. There are so many ways in which you can tune such an instrument (including so many ways of getting an awful sound out of it) that I ended up spending all of my time trying to come up with the right sound, and I didn’t have any left to a…</span>

                              <span>Context: 
 I&#x27;ve used Emacs off and on for many years at this point. Throughout that time there have been periods where I really leaned in to it and tried to use it for everything, and there have been periods where I only used it for org and/or magit, etc. I&#x27;ve learned lots of things about it and I&#x27;ve forgotten lots of things about it, but I&#x27;ve never been what I would call an &quot;expert&quot; or even a &quot;power user&quot;. So, when I feel like something isn&#x27;t working well in Emacs, I almost always default to the assumption that I&#x27;m doing something wrong or misunderstanding something, etc. 
 So, it very well may be that I&#x27;m wrong/crazy in my recent conclusion that use-package might not be the ideal abstraction for managing Emacs packages.
 With that out of the way, I&#x27;ll say that when I first saw use-packag…</span>

                              <span>Good morning,
 I recently have become enamored of Typst for document creation. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s approachable, it&#x27;s cross platform, and it&#x27;s extremely capable even in preview beta. I never really got the swing of LaTeX with all the backslash/curlybrace mayhem. 
 In any event, I find myself actually working on a long technical document in Typst in Emacs. There does exist typst-ts-mode so thanks tree-sitter and all those people who manage the grammar libraries for it. However I&#x27;m finding myself in need of a better way of navigating the huge document to get to sections I want to do.
 I looked into the baked-in bookmarks and I could probably use that capability, though I was hoping for more of an customizeable outline mode. Manually setting the bookmarks for an entire document seems tedious. I mainly just want to navigate by headings and that would be sufficient.
 What do people use for this sort of thing (possibly in the LaTeX world?) Just bookmarks with some sort of automated way of populating the bookmarks? I did check the typst-ts-mode and while there are some functions there for compiling, there don&#x27;t seem to be any functions for navigating by semantic structures. Perhaps that&#x27;s baked into tree-sitter itself?
 Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated here.

 I&#x27;m excited to share my new package with you that I&#x27;ve been working on - EMT (Emacs MacOS Tokenizer).
 EMT leverages macOS&#x27;s built-in NLP tokenizer by dynamic module to tokenize and handle CJK words in Emacs. It also introduces a minor mode (emt-mode) that remaps functions forward-word, backward-word, mark-word, kill-word, and backward-kill-word to their CJK compatible versions.

                              <span>So after my struggles getting this setup going I&#x27;m really enjoying this setup.
 Thought I&#x27;d post here as there is quite a bit of intersectionality between the emacs, Arch, Steamdeck, Nix and Mechboards communities.
 Spec as follows:
  
Steamdeck (LCD);
 SteamOS 3.5 Preview (Arch based and compatible with Nix packages);
 Emacs 29 (via Nix package);
 DooM config + some tweaks of my own; and
 Corne Light v2 with random DSA caps.
  
Ambitions for this setup are:
  
Better emacs-fu (thanks to everyone here with their help so far);
 RGB underglow on the keyboard for 90s vibes;
 Printed keycaps in jazzy colours;
 Better keymap (maybe Miryoku or something with homerow mods)

                              <span>Hi,
 I was thinking how we can solve the ctrl+c &quot;problem&quot;, I found that the ctrl+c with cua-mode is working as copy when a region is selected and it is working az prefix when there is no region selected.
 I would like to ask that is possible to change the ctrl+c in the &quot;c&quot; codebase easily or I don&#x27;t know where ?
 It can be a patch and create a custom build to myself ...
 Or I just live with it and there is no way to put this &quot;user prefix&quot; to an other key combination ?
 thanks for the answers!

 I&#x27;m trying to set up emacs for webdev and I cannot get good completions for html and css. I have installed lsp-mode and html-ls along with css-ls, but completions are still rather poor compared to VSCode.
 Is there a way to get better autocomplete?

                              <span>A few days ago I asked if there was a Vim port of Denote. Well, I went ahead and had ChatGPT help me make one.
 Here it is: https://git.sr.ht/~ashton314/vim-denote
 Why make this? So my Vim-using friends (what can I say—I&#x27;m a tolerant guy) can work with me on some shared Denote-formatted notes.
 Is the package awful? Yes. Am I gonna fix it? No. I&#x27;ve written enough Vim script to last a long time. I&#x27;ll go back to the nice land of Emacs Lisp now. (In spite of all its warts, it&#x27;s still a Lisp and therefore beautiful.)

                              <span>In the spirit of transparency and buzz and excitement, I want to share with you some progress I&#x27;m making on The Archive&#x27;s plugin system.
Starting with an odd one to not spoil all too much at once 
Today was the first time I used the very much work-in-progress development view to verify a couple of JavaScript quirks in the interactive REPL. It&#x27;s basically line-by-line code execution to test algorithms and poke around things:

The top part is the actual script editing part and filled with a placeholder comment. Nothing to see there yet.
So here&#x27;s a verified rumor -- the scripting language will be JavaScript by default. Reason for that is the excellent and secure environment Apple provides out of the box. (Other languages I would have preferred would require us to ship the language environment or depend on the user installing everything. So this is currently the only sane way to get started. Let&#x27;s see what the future holds, though.)</span>

                              <span>In my experience, if you view mathematical programming as hammering a nail in, MATLAB gives you scissors when you really need a hammer.
 I wish to abstract away from all MATLAB code writing by creating a code generator in Haskell. I am curious if you know of any projects that deal with similar problems I could use for inspiration. For now, I have a scope for the problem:
 The generator should be able to produce algorithms dealing with arrays and linear algebraic objects. Combining the right types from the vector-space and linear libraries, it should be possible to
  
operate on types like SquareMatrix, which get translated to an if condition with error on the start of the MATLAB function- evaluate linear functions, operators, maps and folds as imperative code from some basic building blocks.
 These computations will likely be in their own possibly monadic type and it should be possible to evaluate actions into either MATLAB code or direct execution as if it were a (almost) pure haskell function.
 Actions can be used to define MATLAB functions. Code generated from computations using a defined function should not repeat code, but generate the correct call instead

 So, I&#x27;m using Guix to manage my dependencies because of its high reproducibility. Guix has the wonderful &#x60;shell&#x60; command that allows the user to spawn a shell with the desired tools and use it. So, I&#x27;m writing an org file for a research project of mine that has shell, R, and Python blocks.
 The &#x60;:shebang&#x60; command works quite well to orient the shell where to run a particular block:
 #+NAME: no-cow #+BEGIN_SRC shell :shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash cowsay &quot;Hello Babel&quot; || echo &quot;There isn&#x27;t any cow here.&quot; #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: no-cow : There isn&#x27;t any cow here. #+NAME: has-cow #+BE…</span>

                              <span>The context here is, I&#x27;m working in a company environment that is using https://trunk.io in its dev environment, which is kind of a meta-linter for many languages. It wraps a bunch of backend lint tools and combines their results, and enforces a company wide policy on all of them. They provide integrations for a few IDEs, but nothing specific to emacs yet. What they do provide is an LSP proxy to their tool. I have been looking if there is any support in flymake or flycheck to use a generic LSP server as the checker backend, and I haven&#x27;t found anything. Does anyone know if this is possible? Or if there&#x27;s an existing backend that&#x27;s close enough that could be tweaked to do this? I&#x27;ve attempted to duplicate the trunk configuration using individual flymake backends, and the maintenance is just too much. It would be way easier to just make use of the tool directly.

                              <span>By forward function declarations I mean what is needed when a function defined later in the file is called from a preceding one.
 By circular I mean file A requires a function in file B which requires a function in file A. Something along those lines
 PS. Apologies for inquiring about this again. I am sure I enquired sometime in the past and forgotten the actual question and the response to it.

 I was surprised to see Emacs on wayland was running slower than its counterpart on Xwayland. Also the fonts issue was not fixed.
 While zooming in makes the fonts look better. On X i don&#x27;t have this issue.

                              <span>If I understand it right, goto-last-change should go to the places where I made the last edits. But often, when I want to go back, it seems to have &quot;forgotten&quot; them, jumps to a very old edit, and then displays &quot;No further change info&quot; in the minibuffer.
 I just had the problem again. I made sure the edits are very far away, many lines in the same org-buffer. Neither goto-last-change-reverse nor goto-last-change does find them. But when I use undo-redo, all my &quot;forgotten&quot; edits are found and subsequently undone. How can that be?
 Do you use a different function for going back to the last edits? Or am I using goto-last-change in a wrong way? The variable glc-default-span is set to 8, and I am using Org mode version 9.6.9 and Emacs 29.1. Thank you for any advice!
 Edit: I also use undo-fu-session, could it be that this interferes with goto-last-change?

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m getting really frustrated by how unpredictable &#x60;C-&#x60; mappings are when it&#x27;s bound to both uppercase and lowercase character. What I&#x27;ve tried:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-q&quot;) &#x27;cmd) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-Q&quot; | &quot;C-S-q&quot; | &quot;C-S-Q&quot; | &quot;C-\S-q&quot; | &quot;C-\S-Q&quot; | ...) &#x27;cmd-2) 
 and swapping the lines.
 I never manage to get the intended behaviour – it keeps translating the uppercase to lowercase or vice-versa. And sometimes it doesn&#x27;t – there seems to be no pattern.
 Could someone help me out?

                              <span>I&#x27;m losing my mind over emacs as a python IDE. It seems that no matter which LSP concept I attempt, the experience is suboptimal. At best it is riddled with odd issues, and at worst almost bordering unusable.
 I work as a python developer, and I work on quite large code bases. The LSP experience is essential for me given the complexity, but I&#x27;m at the point of giving up, even though I&#x27;ve been an emacs user for the better part of a decade.
 I use doom emacs, by the way, but I&#x27;m quite happy to try anything to solve this. I have considered to build an emacs config from scratch again to see if I can narrow down the experience, but right now I have not invested the time. But again, considering how frustrated and desparate I am, everything is on the table.

 I wonder if there is any similar package or eglot configuration to replicate what Error Lens does in vscode? Thank you in advance.
 My config looks as follows, I&#x27;d kindly appreciate any suggestion that could help me to improve my eglot experience:
 (use-package! eglot :defer t :init (setq eglot-autoshutdown t) :config (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilities &#x27;(:hoverProvider :documentLinkProvider :inlayHintProvider :documentOnTypeFormattingProvider)) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(rust-mode &quot;rust-analyzer&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(scala-mode &quot;metals&quot;)) (add-hook &#x27;eglot-managed-mode-hook (lambda () (flymake-mode -1))) :hook ((rjsx-mode rust-mode typescript-mode js2-mode scala-mode) . eglot-ensure))

                              <span>Monoid is a monoid in Hask (-&gt;), with a unit () and a pair as the tensor.
 Moniod &#x3D; MonoidalOf (-&gt;) () (,) 
 It is famous that Monad is a monoid in the (~&gt;) category
  
&quot;A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, ..&quot;
  
with the Identity functor as unit and functor composition as a tensor.
 What is less well-known is that Applicative is a similar monoid with a different tensor.
 Monad &#x3D; MonoidalOf (~&gt;) Identity Compose Applicative &#x3D; MonoidalOf (~&gt;) Identity Day 
 These are explained in &quot;Notions of Computation as Monoids&quot;: https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/pubs/Notions_of_Computation_as_Monoids.pdf.
 Here is a compilation I have made of other monoid typeclasses, I haven&#x27;t seen a more complete list elsewhere. I put the focus on structuring them clearly to elucidate the pattern.

                              <span>I tried looking at org-ql and found it to be a little overcomplicated for my more limited use cases.
 I felt like something simpler should exist, so I&#x27;m thinking of creating a mini query language that can be used to reference specific notes.
 Some examples:
 mynotes.org/0 -- grab first note in mynotes.org, a file in the current directory.
 /0/0 - grab first note of the first note of the current file.
 ../sibling note -- subnote of parent of current note with title &quot;sibling note&quot;.
 /0/0/1 -- relative to current file, 2nd note of the first subnote of the first subnote.
 ./0/1 -- 2nd subnote of the first subnote relative to current note.
 ../0/0 -- 1st subnote of the first subnote relative to the 
 The query function would have &quot;find one&quot; and &quot;find all&quot; functions. find one would fail if there were 0 or 2+ results.
 This query language would be focused around the following needs:
  
Ability to straightforwardly pass a reference to a note from one command line app that reads org mode to another.
 Ability to programmatically reference one note from another by relative or absolute location. There are some command line applications I&#x27;d like to build around org mode which would need something like this.
 Simplicity. I could add all sorts of bells and whistles to this but it would overburden it.
  
The other idea I had was to just use xpath but apply it to org mode. xpath is well known but I think it&#x27;s not so well liked, and the above queries would be possible but a lot more gnarly.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Bad idea?

 I posted this benchmark in the rust and golang subreddits some time ago and the community made suggestions that sped up the code...so I thought it&#x27;d be fair to post it here to get some feedback.
 nb: This is my first time writing scala.

                              <span>I came across an issue using Emacs when switching to a wayland compositor (hyprland).
 The fonts don&#x27;t look right as you can see at the screenshot below, but zooming in makes it better.
 My current emacs build is using LUCID no PGTK.
 I&#x27;m thinking of building another Emacs build with PGTK support that runs natively on Wayland without Xwayland. However i&#x27;d like to install them both.
 As i use Lucid version on XMonad most the time, but still when i switching to wayland i could still have a better font.

 Do recommend your favourites!
 So far I&#x27;ve seen:
 ​
  
the port of the VScode Synthwave &#x27;84 theme - though: 
 not noob friendly as it&#x27;s not in doom-themes
 seems to not have the extra-cool glow effect (no idea how to achieve that on emacs)
 
 the doom-themes port of laserwave
  
Any others I should consider?

 and indeed it does work. However, after upgrading from Emacs 27.1 to 29.1, I am suddenly getting a compiler warning 
 Warning: Unknown type: proper-list 
 for such lines, unless I either rewrite it more verbosely as
 (cl-check-type &#x27;(a b) (satisfies proper-list-p)) 
 or provide an explicit type definition
 (cl-deftype proper-list () &#x27;(satisfies proper-list-p)) 
 Is anyone aware, if this is intended behavior?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a noob (of nearly 3 years using emacs).
 Buffer / window management still confuses me.
 I haven&#x27;t really learned to use / position / switch windows and buffers. Simply because I used to one org-mode window most of the time.
 Now I&#x27;m using org-roam, amd dealing with multiple small files, I keep getting stuck in silly situations, like ending up with:
  
a roam buffer and my fallback buffer vertically stacked - when I want to &quot;fullscreen&quot; the window with the roam buffer, I can&#x27;t delete or kill the fallback window / buffer.
 
two fallback buffers vertically stacked. Neither of which I can kill or delete.
 
 Is there a good guide somewhere?

                              <span>Just in case someone else also stumbles over this: Somewhere between 27.1 and 29.1, the behavior of format-spec has changed, when the substitution is a symbol.
 Prior to upgrading to from 27.1 to 29.1, invocations
 (format-spec &quot;Hello %a!&quot; &#x27;((a . world))) 
 would evaluate to the string
 &quot;Hello world!&quot; 
 As of 29.1, the behavior depends on whether a function is bound to world: If no function is bound to world&#x27;, the same result as in 27.1 will be obtained, but if a function is bound toworld&#x27;, it will be invoked without arguments, and the return value will be used instead of the symbol name.
 This has bitten me in my &#x60;.emacs&#x27;, where I had code using 
 (format-spec &quot;[...] &#x60;%s-p&#x27; [...]&quot; &#x60;(... (?s . ,type-name) ...)) 
 to generate a doc-string, and got an unexpected error
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (1 . 1) 0) 
 upon start-up, due to a function some-type-p being called without arguments under the new behavior, instead of interpolating it as symbol-name.
 Order of execution
 This was especially confusing, due to the introduction of a dependence on the order of execution. E.g. create a file /tmp/test.el with contents 
 ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*- (format-spec &quot;Hello %s!&quot; &#x27;((?s . foo-p))) (defun foo-p (obj) t) (princ &quot;Done.\n&quot;) 
 then 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el Done. 
 but
 &gt;&gt;&gt; emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el --load /tmp/test.el Wrong number of arguments: ((t) (obj) t), 0 Done. Error: wrong-number-of-arguments (((t) (obj) t) 0) mapbacktrace(#f(compiled-function (evald func args flags) #)) debug-early-backtrace() debug-early(error (wrong-number-of-arguments ((t) (obj) t) 0)) foo-p() format-spec(&quot;Hello %s!&quot; ((115 . foo-p))) eval-buffer(# nil &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) load(&quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) command-line-1((&quot;--load&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; &quot;--load&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot;)) command-line() normal-top-level()

                              <span>Hi
 I managed to setup lsp and java for emacs. I can compile and all works fine.
 I set compile command in init.el to run javac and java command so I see the result, as below.
 (setq compile-command &quot;javac YourJavaFileName.java &amp;&amp; java YourJavaClass&quot;)
 For now I have to replace &quot;YourJavaClass&quot; with current class. Can anyone help me to automatically pass currently opened class name to that command, please?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Is there some way to make visual-line-mode more smart about line-breaks? As depicted in fig.1, visual-line-mode doesn&#x27;t really handle overly-long lines (e.g. due to URLs) well. Disabling it entirely makes a bad overall trade-off in files containing mostly textual lines (fig.2).
 It could improve by allowing line-breaks on some non-whitespace characters (like &quot;-&quot; or &quot;/&quot;) or simply disabling visual-line-mode entirely for &quot;words&quot; that anyway need more than one line. Better yet, for any word exceeding a maximum character-length (e.g. 50) in order to better handle lines containing a few words, but also a moderately long URL (e.g. when using the markdown syntax [link name](link url)).
 I&#x27;ve found no existing options in the M-x customize interface, nor any relevant packages in M-x package-list-packages (including MELPA).
 Fig.1 When breaking long \&quot;words\&quot; like URLs, visual-line-mode is not very smart about where to break the lines.
 Fig.2 For URLs, having no visual-line-mode line breaks active would be preferable, but the disadvantage of disabling visual-line-mode for lines with actual text is too big to just disable visual-line-mode entirely.

                              <span>I do use desktop-mode to restore my tab and window layouts and loaded buffers. I also switch workplaces regulary and use different monitor layouts with different scaling factors.
 It would be great to use dekstop save mode without saving/restoring frame postion and size.
 I am aware of desktop-restore-frames but unlike it&#x27;s name, at least on Emacs 29, setting this to #f also doesn&#x27;t restore tab configuration and window layouts what I don&#x27;t want.

 I suppose I can write a scraper and dump content in json format. I&#x27;d prefer a plaintext format like org-mode and was designed with some thought put into this, instead of me cobbling something together.

                              <span>Introduction to Erules Library: A Practical Guide
 Erules is a lightweight, simple, and functional Scala library for rule evaluation. In this article, we will explore how to use this library to define and evaluate rules efficiently. Follow step-by-step for a detailed and hands-on understanding of use cases.
 What is Erules?
 Erules is a library that provides a rule evaluation engine in Scala. It is designed to be straightforward, typed, and functional, leveraging the power of Cats core. With Erules, you can define rules clearly and evaluate them on various data types concisely.
 Step 1: Import the Library
 To get started, add Erules as a dependency to your Scala project. You can do this in the build.sbt file with the following declaration:

                              <span>Using optparse-applicative I&#x27;m trying construct a parser that collects everything after the first argument into a list of strings. My goal is to write a tool that wraps another tool, adding a few commands and passing all unknown commands on.
 I&#x27;d hoped to find that strArgument would take anything and turn it into a string, i.e. that something like this would work:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; main :: IO () main &#x3D; do execParser optParser &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print
 data Opts &#x3D; OptFoo String [String] deriving (Show)
 optParser &#x3D; info (fall  helper) fullDesc where fall &#x3D; OptFoo  strArgument (metavar &quot;CMD&quot;  help &quot;git command&quot;)  many (strArgument mempty) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It works nicely for ordinary arguments:
  ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly OptFoo &quot;baz&quot; [&quot;silly&quot;] 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work with options
 &#x60;&#x60; ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly foo --bar Invalid option--bar&#x27;
 Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and it also picks up --help
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly --help Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD
 Available options: CMD git command -h,--help Show this help text &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I suspect optparse-applicative simply wasn&#x27;t written with this use case in mind and I&#x27;m failing to see any way of writing such a parser. Is there a way to do this using optparse-applicative, or should I look at other option/argument parsing packages?

                              <span>tl;dr - see Question below
 Background / my setup
 So I&#x27;ve used a GTD-like setup in org-mode for a few years now. I&#x27;m very much still a noob.
 One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I&#x27;m making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).
 For example, I&#x27;d write something like the below and need to type &quot;Big/Small Important Work Project&quot; a number of times with my big fat fingers:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ** Big Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project
 ** Small Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (Note, I don&#x27;t actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)
 In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone 
 I therefore get tasks like &quot;call amit&quot; or &quot;book room&quot; a lot, devoid of context.
 Question:
 Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children? Maybe appended to them?
 I realise this is not nessecarily an Org, or emacs, problem but I hope I can solve it programatically in emacs.

                              <span>For those interested, I just released orgmunge version 0.2.0 (GitHub, PyPi). This version will attempt to parse the TODO keywords specified in the input file/text if they exist; otherwise, it lets you flexibly specify the TODO keywords as an argument to the parser or via a local file.

                              <span>I read the documentation of using MTL library but I would love some more examples to work this through. Say that I have Haskell code looking like:
 haskell foo :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; State Int () foo global local | local &gt;&#x3D; 10 &#x3D; put 100 | otherwise &#x3D; do if (ord local) &#x60;elem&#x60; global then do put (local) foo global (local + 1) else do return () 
 Note: This program means absolutely nothing. This is a very basic structure of a program I am working on. As you see that the first parameter is a read-only global variable which I wish to abstract out in a Reader monad. I know I have to work with StateT.
  newType State s m a &#x3D; State { runStateT :: (s -&gt; m (s, a)) } -- where m is the inner monad 
 My understanding is that I should change my function signature to:
  foo :: Int -&gt; StateT Int (Reader String ()) foo &#x3D; undefined -- I don&#x27;t know how to implement this 
 Can someone please help me with this?

                              <span>How do I use the fixed-pitch font for math fragments in org-mode buffers? I.e., I want to use a monospace font for all strings of the form \(...\) or \[...\], where ... may include newline characters as well, as is common for equations written in math display mode. 
 I&#x27;m an Emacs newb, so the best I could come up with was a regex-based font-lock:
 (progn (setq-local font-lock-keywords &#x60;((,(rx (group (or &quot;\\[&quot; &quot;\\(&quot;) (zero-or-more anything) (or &quot;\\]&quot; &quot;\\)&quot;))) (1 &#x27;fixed-pitch)))) (font-lock-fontify-buffer)) 
 And then running this on an org-mode-hook.
 But this is definitely wrong. Not only does it remove all the nice org-mode styling applied to things like section headers, but it&#x27;s also applying the fixed-pitch font to more than just the intended math fragments, suggesting issues with the regex at least.

 - transient menus
 - asynchronous process calls
 Overall: more accessible a much faster, less resource intensive. Thanks for all feedback in the last days, that helped me bring it forward!

 idk what these icons symbolise i don&#x27;t want any lavish gif as icons but these icons just don&#x27;t make sense to me is there any font pack i have to modify or do i have to modify any icons file contents
 i want to patch this issue i&#x27;m just annoyed with this issue at this point i have been using this since last two years i didn&#x27;t care much to resolve this but now it&#x27;s just annoying
 i did nerd-icons-install-fonts to install fonts in my computer i even did something else to set fonts i don&#x27;t remember what it was

                              <span>Eglot is a lot more bare-bones than lsp-mode – leaving &#x27;UI chrome&#x27; to external packages that can work generically with emacs&#x27; existing ecosystem (flymake/eldoc/etc.) – and this generally works for me. Making similar migrations in my config has worked out very well – notably to use vertico family of packages for completions.
 Are there packages you like that provide additional chrome on what eglot makes available? I&#x27;m particularly interested in project diagnostics from flymake, but I&#x27;m curious to see what else folks have come across.

                              <span>Is there some package in Emacs, that works as a web server, that can be used for testing the project, that you are currently working on?
 For example, I have a project folder, that&#x27;s currently opened in Emacs with html, css and js files is there a package, that will run a web server on the project&#x27;s working path.
 I mean, it&#x27;s possible to just open files on the web browser, but, there are situations in HTML5, that are prohibited without using web server, i.e. AJAX and WebSocket and some other technologies. Also, if you use local version (not the web server), you cannot use absolute paths to files in the project, because they will differ from those on the web server.

 I would like to be able to click, or use some hot key, while cursor being over urls, in this case: &quot;style.css&quot;, &quot;script.js&quot; and &quot;page2.html&quot;, and it would open that document for editing or, if the document&#x27;s file doesn&#x27;t exist, it would open an empty file with such name.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m looking for a package to manage bookmarks for inside Emacs.
 I&#x27;ve tried the built-in functionality but the configuration contains a lot of junk which makes it hard to manage and share between machines.
 With junk I mean information besides configuration such as time last changed.
 Configuration what any configuration is, the individual bookmark with title location and so on.

If it is rare could you explain when you needed to define your own instead of using a combination of the standard ones mentioned above?

 I present to you kickstart.emacs.
 A starting point for Gnu Emacs with good defaults, vim keybindings and packages that most people may want to use without needing to watch hours of tutorial videos to get started.
 One of the project goals is to become something like kickstart.nvim.
 Or, to be a reference if someone doesn&#x27;t know how to do something.
 I would appreciate any feedback.
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>I have this type of code in my init.el each loads the features in a directly and it turns out that because the file names contained the - character they were not being loaded, as the regex checks for only alphanumeric filenames which are not hidden.
 (let ((default-directory (expand-file-name &quot;wsi/lisp&quot; user-emacs-directory))) (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path (directory-files default-directory nil &quot;[^\\.][a-z0-9]*&quot;))) 
 By the way I copied this from someone&#x27;s init.el and I&#x27;ve suffered from it for ages, an object lesson on how one should not copy init.el files and other Emacs lisp code without fully understanding the code in them.
 I&#x27;m not sure but it looks like the regex will not even match file names with capitals in them.
 I guess the question I want to ask is how to add arbitrary non-alphabetical characters to a regex matching alphanumeric characters, with the proviso that they are acceptable in file names..

                              <span>i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need elisp as i&#x27;m using emacs distribution
 i want to learn basics elisp so that i can understand how to map keys how to send commands etc.
 constructs that all beginners require
 please don&#x27;t send a 300 page pdf for elisp as i don&#x27;t want to learn everything i just want a basic max 10 page rulebook for elisp 
 ​
 my teacher told me to use emacs and i love the experience so far thanks to the support from this community
 i have not yet learned how to execute command like 
 menu-bar--display-line-numbers-mode-relative
 i don&#x27;t know how to 
 run tab-width command with and set it to 4 after using M-x to open dialogue box to run command
 (i think it&#x27;s called buffer not dialogue box)
 ​
 so this is the level i&#x27;m at not much i know but i hope that emacs gods help me in finding true peace

                              <span>Hey there,
 I ve been experimenting with Monads. Then i realized (-&gt; a) is a Monad (that made me so happy and made the monads more accesible somehow ).
 Today i started to play with Comonads. My intuition was like hmm probably (-&gt; * a) is a Comonad. I wasnt sure how to express that in Haskell. Also :i Comonad only showed ((,) e).
 Before giving up though i tried the Comonad functions on types of (-&gt; a)They worked !
 λ&gt;&#x3D; extend (\x -&gt; x [1 ,2 ] ) length [10] 3 it :: Int λ&gt;&#x3D; extract (++[10]) [10] it :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; [a] λ&gt;&#x3D; duplicate (++[10]) [1] [2] [1,2,10] it :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; [a] 
 Could someone explain how it works please?

 https://github.com/emacs-openai/chatgpt
 Just found and installed it and it works great. You only need an API Key from Open AI.

                              <span>Could you recommend themes (dark or light) with warm green background? The closest one to what I&#x27;m looking for is Robin Hood. Organic Green, Shaman, and Kingsajz are too blueish for my taste. And most other &quot;green&quot; themes only use green as foreground colour.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have encountered an oddity preventing me from using DooM EMacs on my work Intel MacBook Pro (Linux user at home). 
 I installed Doom EMacs from the official GitHub page using Homebrew emacs-mac package. 
 Conditions:
  
If I open a file using the Mac terminal &#x60;emacs test.org’ then 2 instances of DooM EMacs will instantiate. 1) that is of the document I requested, and 2) a DooM Emacs home screen. 
 
If I click an icon through the Mac finder then all works as expect. 
 
If I create a zsh or bash shell script with emacs test.org and execute then the script will hang.
 
 My .zsh looks as so:  alias emacs&#x3D;&#x27;open /Applications/EMacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs&#x27; 
 Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been acquainting myself with Emacs (vanilla) and am currently reading through the tutorial. I&#x27;m at the part about creating new frames and, as you can see on the image, the new frame shows up small and squished. This also happens sometimes when opening Emacs regularly. I doubt that is intended. I have not found any topics related to this behaviour (maybe my google-fu is just bad). Anyone encounter this before and have a potential fix? I don&#x27;t have an init file yet and I&#x27;m on Fedora if that helps.
 Edit: Just now realised reddit didn&#x27;t include the image, don&#x27;t know how to do it afterwards, but &quot;solved&quot; anyway.

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I decided to learn Org mode recently, and wanted to add some of my custom vim keybindings to Doom emacs, but there are two keybindings i have problem with.
 The first one being with avy where i want to use &quot;s&quot; in normal mode to start the search. But this isnt working:
 (map! :after evil :n &quot;s&quot; &#x27;avy-goto-char-2)
 I have similiar syntax with other binds and they work. I added &quot;:after evil&quot; since that was a suggestion in another reddit thread i found
 Another binding i want to add is to make &quot;C-d&quot; act as &quot;C-d-z-z&quot; (I want to have the current functionality of vim/emacs, but center the text when i scroll) Any ideas on how i can achieve this?

                              <span>I have been using Magit and Forge for several years, mainly with projects on self-hosted Gitlab instances. The experience has been great!
 One of the nice things that Forge did for me was showing the numbers of merge requests (in !123 form) in my magit-log views. Some time ago, however, this stopped working. Actually, this stopped working quite some time ago, maybe a year or more. I was too lazy to report it and too busy to investigate. IIRC it didn&#x27;t stop working right away for all repos, so I guess it is not related to e.g. upgrading to Emacs 28 (and it was definitely before I upgraded to Emacs 29.1). 
 To investigate this in more detail, I created new clones of several projects, but that didn&#x27;t change anything. I also tried a simplified Emacs config in a new home directory to make sure that Forge&#x27;s database was created from scratch. Same problem persists. 
 On Forge&#x27;s Github pages, I found some references to interactions of Forge with bug-reference-mode, so maybe it somehow has to do with that? On the other hand, given that I used a fresh Emacs config + new clones, I guess this isn&#x27;t the cause of the issue either. 
 Does anyone know how to get the MR numbers back in Magit&#x27;s log view?

How do I move them all at once to that top level directory for easier management/renaming? I don&#x27;t want to have to go into each directory and move them one at a time with R. Let&#x27;s say all of the files are MP4 or HEVC.

                              <span>I am a Neovim user, and I am trying out Emacs.
 I recently started with doom emacs, it feels pretty good. However, one issue I am facing is that pyright works very slow. I know that it is an issue with pyright, which I faced with Neovim also.
 However, I made it faster for my use-case by changing some settings. Neovim allows to have these settings in the setup function for LSP. I was trying to figure out how do I change these settings with doom emacs. Pyright docs suggest to have these settings in pyrightconfig.json.
 I think this is more of a pyright issue, but feel like somebody might have already solved it.

 PlantUML works as expected when generating images, for instance:
 :file *.png
 The problem is, there is no ASCII generated in results: verbatim mode:
 :results verbatim
 png generated in RESULTS instead of expected ASCII text. What could go wrong?

 https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-plantuml.html
 there seems to be no reason why this should not work.
 UPDATE:
 The docs appear to be somewhat outdated or smth is not correctly setup. I&#x27;ve found that specifying a :file .txt actually allows to generate ASCII in a text file. The only question is: how to preview it in the org-mode now? 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +begin_src plantuml :file ascii.txt
 Bob -&gt; Alice : Hello World!
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 [[file:ascii.txt]]

 I use ivy-switch-buffer and its helm counterpart in my vanilla emacs configuration.
 Is there some way to get these functions to the same as Doom or swiper-all?

I use parallel compilation in Cabal and Nix, and I split my projects into smaller sub-packages already, and unless I get a decent compilation time improvement for M3 Max over M2, I&#x27;d prefer keeping a lighter and smaller M2 Air for now and maybe wait for another iteration.
 Has anyone been lucky to test that new chip in a compilation-heavy environment already?

                              <span>A recent post got me thinking about how we might go about extracting nested optional values with the convenience of Kotlin and TypeScript, but while still leveraging Scala&#x27;s rich monadic types. Odersky&#x27;s comment on another post indicated a way to reproduce a version of the ? syntax using Scala&#x27;s boundary/break. His example works only with A | Null values, however. I wanted to see if I could accomplish the same while:
  
Supporting ? on any optional/failable type,
 Preserving failure types by returning an Either and tracking any failure types encountered in the get chain, and
 Still avoid any intermediate allocations (only construct the Either at the end)
  
You can see my attempt in this gist
 The syntax is:
 val result: Either[F1 | F2 | F3, A] &#x3D; getEither(obj1.?.obj2.?.obj3) 
 Where F1, F2, and F3 are the failure types of obj1, obj2, and obj3. Option fails with Unit, Try fails with Throwable, and Either fails with its left type.
 I&#x27;m doubtful I&#x27;d ever actually use this: having to a) import &#x60;getEither&#x60; and &#x60;?&#x60;, b) wrap the statement in &#x60;getEither&#x60;, and c) add a dot before each &#x60;?&#x60; seems like just a little more would make me skip the usual syntax, but it was fun and interesting to work out how to do it. I&#x27;d be curious to hear others&#x27; thoughts.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Along similar lines, it occurred to me that you could produce an implementation of Option that has no allocation overhead. You can check out my attempt at that here. It just uses A | Null under the hood as an opaque type. It&#x27;s two limitations that I know of are:
  
toString does not show None or Some(x) but null and x (this is just a limitation of opaque types)
 I can&#x27;t figure out a way to implement exhaustive extractors. Instead, you can use the fold method (which I&#x27;ve been using more and more these days anyways)

                              <span>Hello there .
 I am using as my OS devuan gnu+linux .
 The point is I like philosophy of Unix using like tmux + nvim + mutt .
 and I love the vi keybings so much .. 
 Sometimes I am thinking to switch to gnu emacs .. but I feel that I will find some difficulties
 and I am afraid . 
 Is there a easy way to use emacs ?
 can someone help or give me some YT videos to watch to have a good idea about emacs ?

I need to collaborate on some notes with a Vim user. It&#x27;d be nice if there were some tools in Vim that they could use to navigate Denote-formatted Markdown files as easily as I can. Does anyone know of a Vim plugin that works with Denote?

                              <span>Hi Everyone.
 I&#x27;m using emacs and ripgrep to find what I&#x27;m looking for in a folder. Ripgrep shows the result of what I&#x27;m looking beautifully. Thats great. Every time I open a result, ripgrep buffer disappears. 
 Does anyone know how to open a temp buffer to view result then I can close it and go back to rg result again, so I don&#x27;t have to type my search query.
 Thanks.

Now when (while still being in agenda) I do switch buffer among the options I see are the org agenda files. I don’t want that.
 If I ever want to see them I will open them explicitly (not want to see them when they were opened automatically by agenda)

                              <span>When checking the weather for different locations in org-babel, I encountered an issue where the symbol for partly cloudy was not displayed correctly. Here is the code I used: 
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output curl &#x27;wttr.in/{Paris,SanJose,Washington}?format&#x3D;4&#x27; #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : Paris: 🌧 🌡️+10°C 🌬️↗9km/h : SanJose: ☀️ 🌡️+16°C 🌬️↘15km/h : Washington: ⛅️ 🌡️+12°C 🌬️↓4km/h 
 The symbol of partly-cloudy in washington was not rendered:
 https://preview.redd.it/oisno3plx9zb1.png?width&#x3D;641&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;54d2246de4877f8c08bdb98fc8504b27ea1b36da
 I&#x27;m currently using Emacs 29.1 on Windows 10, and have set the symbol fonts as &quot;&quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot; which does have symbol of partly-cloudy.
 (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot; nil &#x27;prepend) 
 I alterntively tried &quot;Symbola&quot; font but the issue repeats. How could solve the problem?

                              <span>It&#x27;s a feature that I miss from Clion, my current workflow is by using a 3rd party linter after my coding session outside of Emacs. I know that I can use the linter with an after-save-hook, but is there any other solutions with flycheck or lsp integrations? (I tried flycheck-clang-tidy but I didn&#x27;t get any warrings or indicators, not sure if clang-tidy can detect them though)

                              <span>As the title suggests, is there a monomorphizing + inlining pass available for GHC core? I understand enough to know that this might not be possible for all haskell programs, but if I understand correctly it is a step in the CLASH compiler which supports a very large portion of the language (libraries no, but language yes). I am aware of various pragmas to direct GHC to attempt to do this in specific places, but is there anything like this available in the GHC libraries?

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the latest release of mig-0.2 library. It is a library to write composable servers for simple / boring haskell. The main focus of this release is the ability to serve Swagger UI from the server with ease and ability to create clients from the same code as servers. I&#x27;m happy to confirm that both goals are reached with this release. 
 The tutorial for library was created.
 Also there are many other improvements:
  
OpenApi schema for servers
 swagger servers support (we can add swagger to server with one line of code: withSwagger def server )
 clients from the same code as servers
 redesign of internal types
 redesign of DSL for routes
 many ergonomic improvements
 packages for extra utils
 split of mig package to several packages: 
 mig - core
 mig-wai - rendering servers to wai apps
 mig-client - clients
 mig-extra - extra utils
 mig-server - mig servers with batteries
 mig-swagger-ui - swagger ui server
 
 tutorial and quickstart guide on github pages
 CI for repo with formatter, build and tests and update of docs on github pages
  
The internal type for Servers was redesigned so that we assemble handler function with API description at the same time. In the first release it was just handler function under the hood.
 As a refresher mig is a family of libraries to write lightweight, simple, type-safe and composable servers. It strives to be in the middle ground between scotty and servant. To be composable, flexible and type-safe as servant and simple and lightweight in concepts as scotty.
 Thanks to Ambros for contribution. Also I&#x27;d like to thank authors of packages servant, servant-swagger-ui and servant-openapi3 packages for inspiration for my work in this release. Many lines of code are influenced by those packages.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.17 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This release introduces compatibility with what4 versions up to 1.5.1, and replaces several functions in copilot-core. The second change is a breaking change: the functions replaced have been deprecated and new alternatives introduced instead.
 As always, we&#x27;re releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Jan 7th, 2024.
 In our last announcement, we mentioned that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-libraries and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].
 There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We&#x27;ll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m pulling out my hair trying to figure this out. I don&#x27;t have much experience with the advanced Haskell features (Lenses, constrained type variables) they&#x27;re using in this library so I need halp.
 I&#x27;m trying to write a ToParamSchema instance for a type that will be documented in swagger (link). This is my code:
 instance ToParamSchema DeprSchedule where toParamSchema _ &#x3D; let dollarSchema &#x3D; toSchema (Proxy :: Proxy Dollar) daySchema &#x3D; toSchema (Proxy :: Proxy Day) in mempty &amp; type_ ?~ SwaggerArray &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] 
 When I try to compile, I get this huge error
 src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:357:15: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘t’ with ‘&#x27;Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKindSchema’ arising from a functional dependency between: constraint ‘Data.Swagger.Lens.HasItems (ParamSchema t) (Maybe (SwaggerItems &#x27;Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKindSchema))’ arising from a use of ‘items’ instance ‘Data.Swagger.Lens.HasItems (ParamSchema t1) (Maybe (SwaggerItems t1))’ at  ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: toParamSchema :: forall (t :: Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKind (*)). Proxy DeprSchedule -&gt; ParamSchema t at src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:351:5-17 • In the first argument of ‘(?~)’, namely ‘items’ In the second argument of ‘(&amp;)’, namely ‘items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema]’ In the expression: mempty &amp; type_ ?~ SwaggerArray &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] • Relevant bindings include toParamSchema :: Proxy DeprSchedule -&gt; ParamSchema t (bound at src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:351:5) | 357 | &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] | ^^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded. 
 Plz help, I have no idea what to do with this error.

                              <span>I made a function to check whether a number is divisible only by 2, 3, or 5. After some modifications this is the current form:
 isHammingF :: Integer -&gt; Bool isHammingF number | number  Integer -&gt; Bool recur 1 _ &#x3D; True recur n i | i &gt; 5 &#x3D; False | n &#x60;mod&#x60; i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; recur (n &#x60;div&#x60; i) i | otherwise &#x3D; recur n (i + 1) 
 I based this function from its Kotlin counterpart:
 fun Int.isHammingF(): Boolean { val number &#x3D; abs(this) tailrec fun recur(number: Int, i: Int): Boolean &#x3D; if (i &gt; 5) false else if (number % i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) recur(number / i, i) else recur(number, i + 1) return if (number &lt; 8) number in 1..6 else recur(number, 2) } 
 I&#x27;m trying to make the function easy to translate in the two languages. However, some things are getting in the way:
  
How do I make the value of parameter number absolute? In Kotlin, I just have to make a new variable that holds the absolute value of the parameter in a line, making it more ‘step to step’. But in Haskell, I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s possible to do that in functions.
 Why does when I remove the recur 1 _ &#x3D; True line from the Haskell code, it only evaluate 1–6 as true? I tried to make a list of numbers 1–256, filtered using this function with recur 1 _ &#x3D; True removed, and the result is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. If it were correct, it should still produce [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,…, 250, 256]. I also tried to change it into recur 5 _ &#x3D; True or other numbers, and the resulting list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,…] followed by Hamming numbers divisible by that number. What is recur 1 _ &#x3D; True really? How to remove it if it&#x27;s okay to?
  
Any help is appreciated.

 Elm-like ScalaJS Calculator App
 Hey there,
 I wanted to share my recent experiment with ScalaJS and frontend development. Despite I use Scala for a long time, I don&#x27;t know shit about frontend development. Still, Elm&#x27;s simplicity got me thinking - maybe some of its principles could work in Scala too. So I made a basic calculator app written in ScalaJS and using Tyrian.
 Hope you dig it! Feel free to drop your thoughts.
 Best,

 Can someone help me understand why this is necessary?

A Fistful of Automata by Iago Leal de Freitas (originally published on October 20th, 2023)
Recently, I have been brushing up my knowledge of Formal Languages and stumbled again into the many different faces of finite automata.

As a programmer, you have to constantly be asking, “How Good is my Code?”. There are a lot of different ways code can be “good” or “bad”, but one of the key indicators in many cases is the time performance of your code. How long does it take your code to run…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
A few years ago, I started to take daily note and take a lot, but at the end of a day, I have difficulty on how to deal with those notes.
The major problem is, I can&#x27;t decide the size of a note derived from my daily note.
Say, I take a note like &quot;5 students have sent me the language test invoice regarding applying for an academic reward. In my understanding, this could be directly put into &quot;Academic Reward&quot; or &quot;Things related to Academic Reward for Language Test&quot;. But if I do so, I feel guilty because it looks not even a bit like a Zettel systems.
I heard a lot of so-called atomic notes, but I never really see a real-world, down-to-earth workflow of authentic zettel.</span>

                              <span>While working for a Tweag client, improving and optimizing their Bazel build system, the client gave us a side quest: Enable their CI pipeline to produce regular and complete coverage reports with Testwell CTC++ — a code coverage tool from Verifysoft. This article explains how we integrated Testwell CTC++ coverage testing into their Bazel build system.
Integrating coverage testing with Testwell CTC++ into a project that builds with Bazel has its own unique challenges. We navigated the combination of these two tools to provide a solution that was a good fit for our client.

The mismatch between Bazel’s built-in coverage support and CTC++
As described in its documentation, Bazel does include some support for code coverage reports, however, it is relatively limited and inflexible, only suppor…</span>

                              <span>When I run emacs -nw (Emacs 29.1) in an iterm2 window on a MacBook Pro, it does a decent job of rendering the theme colors. But if in the same window (outside of emacs) I ssh to a server (that has an identical init.el) and run the same, the colors are way off. I&#x27;m looking for advice (beyond &quot;use TRAMP&quot;) for how to get better theme colors over ssh.
 In both cases the value of $TERM is xterm-256color. The output of msgcat --color&#x3D;test is the same in both shells. But in emacs the output of M-x list-color-display is quite different in the two cases: in the local window there are 556 colors with many descriptive names, but in the ssh context there are 256 colors with limited names (color-NNN for NNN in 16 through 255).

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 the title already is quite specific, so I&#x27;ll just try to explain a bit more.
 I use &#x60;text-mode-hook&#x60; to activate &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60; when I am in an org-mode buffer. This approach works quite alright, but I am struggling to make it work with another recent addition to my workflow, &#x60;desktop.el&#x60;.
 I want to use &#x60;desktop&#x60; to save opened files, window and tab bar configurations. After some tinkering this also works out fine, however, when I use &#x60;desktop-read&#x60; on a constellation that contains org-mode buffers, it seems like darkroom-mode is applied twice, i.e. the font is even bigger than with normal &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60; applied.
 I have tried to use &#x60;desktop-after-read-hook&#x60; to re-initialize &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60;:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (defun or/re-initialize-darkroom ()
 (progn
 (darkroom-mode -1)
 (darkroom-mode +1)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, this does not seem to work, because the text still is oversized. If it were only for one tab or buffer where this is the case, I&#x27;d swallow that pill. However, it is the case in all org buffers, which is a tad too annoying with four tabs containing four different org files.
 Thus, I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences, maybe you&#x27;ve got a tip or two for me?
 Have a good day!

 My only issue is mostly aesthetic. I use EXWM and usually run kitty inside it because I like having my terminals have a different background color than my buffers. 
 Is it possible to have emacs color my Eat buffers differently than others? 
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>So my excitement at emacs on my Steamdeck was shortlived
 I rebooted the Steamdeck and Emacs won&#x27;t launch.
 This is a containerised install (with the app exported to the OS&#x27; launcher) on an immutable OS. I&#x27;m struggling (perhaps) because this is my first experience of either.
 I used the Steamdeck install guide on the distrobox wiki
 The only clues I have (apologies for the shorthand, I&#x27;m on my phone and my Steamdeck has no internet) are:
  
If I try to list my distrobox containers I get invalid internal status, try resetting the pause process with ... podman system migrate
 
If I try that command I get Error: could not find a working conman binary and then a list of (non home) paths.
 
 However, the path to conmon is correct in containers.conf
 Is distrobox looking for something (conmon) but I don&#x27;t have the location right in a config file somewhere?

                              <span>I have a minir inconvenience I hope to be able to solve. I have a couple of markdown buffers open. Many times details are hidden away using outline mode. When I use &#x60;rgrep&#x60; to search for occurences in buffers, which are already open, and use the mouse to jump to the matching buffer and occuence, point jumps to the closest visible occurence but doesn&#x27;t &quot;open&quot; details which are hidden because of outline mode.
 Is there a way to reveal the actually matching details?

                              <span>Dear emacs neckbeards, perspective-el (https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el) works really nice but there is some visual clutter because the indicator for the workspace names are visible in each window ( i know doom emacs doesn&#x27;t which is cleaner) , does someone has a solution please ? ( see in picture please )
 To be conicse i just want the workspace indicator e.g [main | second] to be displayed once, at the top left corner, and not 3 times in each window.

 edit: I found out, that the text &quot;[main|second]&quot; is on the header line of each window, controlled by the variable &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; header-line-format &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; which has the value (&quot;&quot; (:eval (persp-mode-line))) in my case.
 One idea would be to track the number of windows in the current workspace with window-list, 
 if it is greated then 2 -&gt; add a hook to every new created window in the workspace and set the variable &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; header-line-format &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; to nil, thus it should be empty, but sadly i dont have time for that at the moment.

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Training for my Centenarian Decathlon
I&#x27;m interested in adopting a &quot;gradient descent&quot; approach to help me systematically identify and explore the most relevant aspects of an idea&#x27;s structure.
I&#x27;m refactoring my ZK Dashboard and the Python programs that create it.
My class on Atmosphere Science is getting interesting as it comes to an end in a few weeks. I&#x27;m concentrating on the final project: a state application for a prescribed burn.
Today (November 8, 2023) is the 5th anniversary of my ZK with The Archive.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Attia, Peter and Gifford, Bill. Outlive: the science &amp; art of longevity. 2023.
Calvino, Italo. The road to San Giovanni. 1994.
Cowen, Tyler. GOAT: Who is the Greatest Economist of all Time and Why Does it Matter?. 2023.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Jeff Oster
Lissie

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

 Any ideas how to get rid of them?
 I suggested a workaround using: 
  (defun my-python-completion-filter (completions) &quot;Filter out the unwanted &#x27;__PYTHON\_EL&#x27; from COMPLETIONS.&quot; (cl-remove-if (lambda (completion) (string-match-p &quot;__PYTHON_EL&quot; completion)) completions)) (advice-add &#x27;python-shell-completion-get-completions :filter-return #&#x27;my-python-completion-filter) 
 but I feel like I should better understand the exact source of the problem and have a more robust solution.

 It seems that the situation is just like one described in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnus-english/2014-02/msg00047.html
 After some debug, I found that GNUS just doesn&#x27;t apply any faces, so (get-text-property pos &#x27;face) returns nil for summary buffer.
 Now I&#x27;m not even sure where should I look for a clue: GNUS sources don&#x27;t seem to be changed much, the same GNUS works fine with emacs 28 and 27, so apparently it&#x27;s a change in emacs itself. Are there any obvious places to check?

 My current workaround is to copy from Emacs, paste in any other application (often Firefox), then copy from there, and finally paste in Brave.
 Has anyone else seen this behaviour? How do I change it?
 (I guess I&#x27;m hoping this is a Brave/Chrome problem, as Firefox handles it brilliantly, but I thought I&#x27;d ask here first as it&#x27;s only when I copy text from Emacs that this happens.)
 (Oh, and yes, unfortunately I do need to use a Chrome-based browser for work. Thank you Microsoft!)

                              <span>Has anyone seen any efforts to make emacs behave more similar to TextMate on macOS? The goal would be to make most keybindings work similar to not only TextMate, but generally accepted keyboard bindings for macOS as well as quitting/opening saving and restoring the &quot;desktop&quot; session saving functionality.
 This would be utilizing the railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport port via brew install emacs-mac --with-emacs-big-sur-icon --with-native-compilation --with-imagemagick --with-librsvg --with-mac-metal --with-starter

                              <span>Following a recent-ish complaint about how a double-width char looked in the popup, I now pushed a somewhat ambitious update to the Company popup&#x27;s rendering (the default, built-in frontend), to master.
 It should better co-habitate with such characters (inside the buffer and in completions) and with other advanced elements (larger text, small images, etc).
 Of course it&#x27;s still overlay-based, and some things are unchanged: e.g. how the text &quot;under&quot; it becomes devoid of certain elements like button decorations (when those are themselves created using overlays) and line numbers.

                              <span>I was using magit normally, but it suddenly stopped working. Specifically I can&#x27;t commit files outside my home directory. Commits in home directory works file, but when committing a file on other partitions fails. Here is the error message:
  1 git … commit -- hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Not inside Git repository 
 With debug info on, here is the full debug message:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Setting ACL&quot; &quot;Operation not permitted&quot; &quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot;) set-file-acl(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) set-file-extended-attributes(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; ((acl . &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer-copy(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG&quot; &quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; 511 ((acl . &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer() basic-save-buffer-2() basic-save-buffer-1() basic-save-buffer(t) save-buffer(1) funcall-interactively(save-buffer 1) call-interactively(save-buffer nil nil) command-execute(save-buffer) 
 I&#x27;ve tried reinstalling emacs and magit, clearing the elpa directory and cache. I&#x27;m on linux. A thing to note is that it suddenly stopped working. A few hours ago it was working fine, but now it errors. I believe there is some permission error on other partitions, but can&#x27;t figure out what.
 Edit: The partition is NTFS formatted.
 Edit #2: The problem is almost certainly due to the partition beign NTFS. For now, I&#x27;ve switched to a ext4 partition.

                              <span>Hello. I am having some difficulty setting up my emacs to do spell check and offer the correct spelling when in LaTeX mode. 
 I currently have got emacs highlighting spelling errors correctly, but cannot get emacs to present the correct spelling for me. 
 I currently hide the tool bar as a like to use emacs mouse free in i3. I use GNU Emacs 28.2 on Debian. I currently only get spell check via :
 (add-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook &#x27;flyspell-mode)
 Does anyone have any advice on how to get emacs to present the correct spelling (ideally without a mouse) while in latex mode. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am not sure this is the right place to share the issue. But I found a bug with typing Korean characters that &quot;overwrite-mode&quot; is not actually working well. (For Japanese/Chinese characters, there is no issue at all.)
 aeoiu
 &#x3D;&gt; あえu
 &#x3D;&gt; 阿榜u
 &#x3D;&gt; 아에aeiou (not working)
 ​
 In the thread, one of the Japanese users reported a bug but it is not appropriate for Korean characters which requires a combination of sub-characters to make a character unlike other Japanese or Chinese characters.
  
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-05/msg00039.html
  
​
  
Is there anyone who has encountered and found a workaround for this? (I know there are a few Korean Emacs users... sadly.. )
 I guess I have to report this issue and try something to fix it. Where can I start with?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s assume this given Python code snippet (real example / Microsoft GitHub Issue).
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import qttools
 def askPasswordDialog(): translator &#x3D; qttools.name_with_typo(language_code) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The package qttools is contained in the same folder/project. The function name_with_typo() does not exist in qttools. This cause an AttributeError when run with a Python interpreter.
 I do use Emacs 27 and 29 with eglot and flake8. The described error is not detected because eglot/flake do not look into the imported package if the function really exist in there.
 Can I fix this somehow?
 Beside of that tested flake8 on shell. It is also not able to detect such a problem.
 Not sure if I can improve the detection within my Emacs environment?

                              <span>Hi, I am using functions from u/daviwil including one adding any roam node containing TODO keywords to the list of agenda files. I see that I must have done something wrong, since I have more than 200 files in my variable org-agenda-files (nothing bad).
 Of course, I can select them one by one and remove them. But this problem lead me to wonder if there is a function in emacs that allows to create a Dired buffer out of a list of files (typically org-agenda-files), in order to be able to remove them if need be with the Dired functions (mark, delete)
 thanks for any info regarding this

                              <span>I just watched Haoyi’s Scala Days talk on his Mill build tool and it made me really want to give it a try. Has anyone here been using it recently? Any pitfalls I should be aware of? Is there a plug-in ecosystem (or whatever the Mill equivalent is) that would support most typical use cases without my having to roll my own? (I’m thinking like docker build, publishing to Sonatype, graal native image, etc.)
 Or to put it another way, what am I going to end up missing from sbt down the road if I switch to Mill?

                              <span>The idea is really simple - I think a major factor that makes type level programming (Edit: syntax within the type namespace) confusing for someone coming from the imperative world is that it shares so much syntax with value level programming (the value namespace). Obviously once you&#x27;ve learned it that&#x27;s really nice and clean, but before you have it can add a lot of confusion. So I came up with these custom instructions that I added to ChatGPT, and type level programming (the type namespace) instantly became much clearer.
 These instructions were generated by ChatGPT and since I don&#x27;t know the language well it&#x27;s possible they could be improved. I&#x27;d really love feedback if anyone experienced sees an issue with how ChatGPT structured these instructions.

One thing I still yet figure out is how to name my files.
On macOS, it&#x27;s not that a big problem as I have DevonThink 3 Pro, tags and smart folders that help me retrieve files. But whenever I don&#x27;t have access to macOS and look through my long list of files in my external SSD, it was so painful. Currently, I only add a timebase UID to the end of all my files. And my file name is already long and lasting.
Is there any suggestion on how to better name my files, making it friendly to both windows, iOS and macOS?</span>

                              <span>I am working through the red book and trying the examples and exercises in a folder on my computer. I created two files GettingStarted and List, both of which I selected as new Scala classes and then Objects in Intellij.
  
I&#x27;ve noticed that I can only have one main function. I can&#x27;t put a main in both GettingStarted and List. The IDE only recognizes the one in GettingStarted. I&#x27;m thinking this entire folder is considered one project, and you can only have one entrypoint in main. Is this right?
 I put extends App in List, and then I could run and debug things in List. I guess extending the main function from GettingStarted, I can then run the List file on its own.
  
Can someone explain to me how I should be thinking about files interacting with each other? In python I would use a __name__ &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;__main__&quot; to run code in each file. In C, I could write an int main() in each file and run each separately. But it seems in Scala it&#x27;s very specific in terms of how def main() can appear.

                              <span>I know there is Iron and there is Refined, but both of those use some synthetic type under the hood and type conversions. 
 Is there any library that provides ways to simply refine types with simple intersection types? This would mean the code would read naturally and the subtyping/supertyping would work out of the box, eg. Int &amp; Positive &amp; Even would be an Int, a Positive number and an even number &quot;0, 2, 4, 6, etc&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving from Doom to Vanilla Emacs because I wanted a better understanding of emacs from the ground up and I&#x27;m trying to replicate the features I liked most from Doom. I&#x27;m using C-h k and entering key-sequences to figure out the underlying functions and installing packages as needed.
 The one I&#x27;m interested in now is &quot;consult-buffer&quot; which I found useful in that it merged open and recently closed files in order that I had worked with them from session to session.
 There are small things bugging me as I&#x27;m not convinced the &quot;sort&quot; for most recently used files/buffers is reliable with the ideal being that the 2nd last used file shows up in the list first, and the 3rd last used file shows up second.
 Doom has configuration set to modify the consult-buffer there to hide the currently active buffer which is at the top by default when I call consult-buffer. I&#x27;m not finding the consult documentation much help (maybe lacking basic background on some of the concepts to grok it) and I was thinking there would be some of setq that you could use like (setq consult-buffer-ignore-top-items 1). I&#x27;m not sure how to dig into Doom&#x27;s internals to see what it is doing either.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to write my own configuration but I&#x27;ve been stuck on having parenthesis autopairing specifically inside of TeX buffers. I&#x27;m also using cdlatex, so I can use the snippet for \left( \right) inside of math, but sometimes I do need a regular &quot;(&quot; insertion. All the other insertions like &quot;{&quot;, &quot;[&quot; and $ get their autopairs, but there is something wrong with parenthesis only.
 ​
  
C-h k ( gives that &quot; &#x27;(&#x27; runs the cdlatex-pbb ... insert a pair of parens, brackets or braces&quot;. Same for all the other keys { and [.
 Global minor modes enabled: Electric-pair is enabled, but I don&#x27;t know if that might be the cause of conflict.
 Inside my init.el I have, for electric-pairs
  
​
  (electric-pair-mode 1) (setq electric-pair-pairs &#x27;( (?\&quot; . ?\&quot;) (?{ . ?}) (?( . ?)) (?[ . ?]))) (setq electric-pair-preserve-balance nil 
 And I&#x27;ve tried to remove the smartparens mode from TeX buffers by adding
 (remove-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook &#x27;smartparens-mode) 
 But I still can&#x27;t get it to work.

 When using pass through my terminal everything works as expected and passwords are removed from the system clipboard after the timeout.
 Does anybody knows how to fix this? I want copied passwords to be removed from all clipboards after the given timeout.

                              <span>I wanted the M-x menu to show particular items at the top, every time I open the menu. Currently, it still shows the items I need at the top, since I use savehist-mode, but the order changes depending on what I select. I&#x27;m using vertico &amp; consult for the selection.
 My current idea is to create a different completing-read command which has the commands I want pinned and I can add &quot;execute-extended-command&quot; as another in there. But a way to pin items would be easier for my use-case.

 Hi; I am using emacs (emacsclient) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with the Gnome desktop (wayland session). I am looking for a way to give emacs a dark title bar to go along with the dark theme, without setting global dark mode (I like some other applications better light), so basically to ask for a dark window decoration on application-basis. Has anyone done this?

 I have found other posts (like this one: https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/doom-emacs-2 or this one https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14129/gtk-enable-set-dark-theme-on-a-per-application-basis) but the solutions here don&#x27;t seem to work for me...

                              <span>Hey all,
 I was hoping to get some advice before I lose a lot of time down this rabbit hole. 
 An important factor in my note taking is accessibility on mobile devices. 
 I&#x27;ve been considering switching my note taking and programming over to Emacs, however those are all markdown.Hence my interest in log seq.Does it work well without mangling your notes like it would for markdown?And how does query suport transfer between the two? As currently obsidian datavieuw queries are a large part of my notetaking flow, and I would like to keep that.
 I&#x27;m aware and in awe of the true power of Emacs, and almost dove into setting up Vim to be the environment I live in, but found Emacs just in time.

 I am a newbie and trying to go through “learn Haskell by making a blog generator” by gilmi..
 It’s a wonderful resource.. but what I am not able to understand is why would one use Haskell or any other language like that? 
 Why not simply use html or css ? Or rails for a web app?
 Why code through another language?
 Is it speed of development ? Or security ? Or something else..
 My apologies if it seems like a dumb question..

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use overlays with the end goal of putting images in some buffer. But the use-case I have in mind require me to be able to make the images temporarily invisible, which I understand should be possible with overlays. Before going to images, I thought I&#x27;ll try making it work with just plain text. But I cannot make it work. I&#x27;m able to create overlays, modify the text shown in the overlay, move the overlay, delete the overlay, but I&#x27;m not able to hide the content of the overlay by setting the invisible property.
 I have looked at the manual, reading about overlays, overlay properties and text properties. I&#x27;ve tried to google for help but haven&#x27;t managed to find anything. I have also tried to look at how existing packages(like the builtin hideshow.el) do this, but without success.

                              <span>Sometimes I stumble on some new, interesting emacs thing that I want to try out. Recent examples: M-r / move-to-window-line-top-bottom, or M-@ / mark-word. Or I want to have a little reminder: &quot;try out foo-mode, it seems interesting&quot;.
 I want some kind of emacs command that would:
  
have a collection of such tips/tricks/ideas.
 When invoked, randomly choose one and show it in a temporary buffer.
  
Is there such a package or command? It seems like it would be nice. Emacs is stuffed full of interesting, weird, useful things that no one seems to know about. And even when I read about something, I might try it once or twice but then forget.
 There&#x27;s org-drill which is kinda close to this, but I want something simpler. Just pick out a thing and show it to me. 
 Suggestions?

                              <span>So I&#x60;m one of those org-mode guys who has emacs installed on pretty much every machine. however my latest install is leaving me feeling really stupid!
 I&#x60;m installing doom emacs on my steamdeck. The OS (Steam OS) is a partially read-only arch based system with Plasma DE that has emacs 29 available as a flatpak.
 I used the manual install from the doom emacs github, but am stuck because I can&#x60;t doom sync
 I added EMACS&#x3D;&quot;/usr/bin/flatpak run org.gnu.emacs&quot; at line 2 of ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom
 however, I still get the error 
 Error: failed to run Emacs with command &#x27;emacs&#x27; Are you sure Emacs is installed and in your $PATH 
 I must be doing something wrong here...

Do others see that behavior too? Note that the quoted text is using Latin small capital letters. If so, do you think it is part of Unicode specification or is it an Emacs bug? Thanks.

                              <span>I have not seen much mention of this amazing package but shout out to the eat (Emulate A Terminal) package. It is my favorite terminal emulator of the bunch (yes even over vterm) and has actually improved my workflow. It does not need an external C library to be downloaded and in my opinion has the best keybindings of any terminal emulator I have tried. It has 3 main modes to cycle between:
  
Input Mode (C-c C-e) &#x3D; similar to vterm&#x27;s copy mode the buffer becomes &quot;frozen&quot; for you to copy the text and scroll back and basically use all of emacs&#x27;s nifty search features.
 Char Mode (C-c M-d) &#x3D; One of my favorite modes where basically every input you make short of the keys C-M-m or M-RET will be sent to the terminal. This means I can open vim/nano/emacs -nw all within the terminal buffer (which I do a lot as I ssh into machines regulary) and it works absolutely perfectly. 
 Semi-Char Mode: The default mode where most inputs will be sent to the terminal. This mode does 90% of the job but if sometimes you have a weird mix of alt and control input combinations to send then the Char Mode is there for you.
  
Just wanted to bring more attention to this pacakage and would recommend others to try it a bit.
 Thank you /u/AkibAzmain for creating and maintaining this package.

 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone is working on a BlueSky emacs client? I know that their project opened the API code or something and there have been a lot of projects involving people making stuff for BlueSky since then. So for those of us who use Emacs, is there anyone doing that?
 Just wondering. 🤔

 #+TBLFM: A&amp;&#x3D;&#x27;(concat &quot;(vhtd/filegroups-init-group&quot; &quot; &quot; (rc-dq C&amp;) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq B&amp;) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq D&amp;) &quot;)&quot;)
 I had to convert the letter references into numbers for the formulae to work.
 #+TBLFM: $1&#x3D;&#x27;(concat &quot;(vhtd/filegroups-init-group&quot; &quot; &quot; (rc-dq $3) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq $2) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq $4) &quot;)&quot;)
 From the documentation. The second example highlights what I&#x27;m referring to. I can&#x27;t remember changing or editing the formula for a long time, unless some command must have changed it without my noticing.
  
Org’s references with unsigned numbers are fixed references in the sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two different fields, the same field is referenced each time. Org’s references with signed numbers are floating references because the same reference operator can reference different fields depending on the field being calculated by the formula.
 Here are a few examples:
 ‘@2$3’ 2nd row, 3rd column (same as ‘C2’)
 ‘$5’ column 5 in the current row (same as ‘E&amp;’)
 ‘@2’ current column, row 2
 ‘@-1$-3’ field one row up, three columns to the left
 ‘@-I$2’ field just under hline above current row, column 2
 ‘@&gt;$5’ field in the last row, in column 5

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to create a formatter for my org files. What I want is a command to enforce strict rules in my org files. Examples: exactly two newlines between headings, no whitespace before drawers, no leading/trailing whitespace on lines, two newlines after lists, paragraphs must be filled, etc.
 I think the way to do this is to use org-element to parse the buffer into an AST, then iterate each element performing transformations as necessary. Not sure if I&#x27;d mutate the current AST or build up a new one.
 Does that sound right? Anything I should be aware of before digging into this?

                              <span>Not really about haskell. Rather about the people coding in haskell and enjoying haskell and their opinion.
 Honestly, what do you think about the books &quot;Domain Driven Design&quot; and &quot;Clean Code&quot;.
 They seem to be so widely spread and read. But I wonder if they are somewhat similar to, lets say, using OOP all day coding in Java.
 Just something a lot of people do which I am not drawn to and would not want to do.
 Should I read them?

                              <span>Hi
 I am a student currently studying Haskell for my graduation project. I&#x27;m wondering how exactly do I manage (install and view) my Haskell packages? I&#x27;m very confused now. I installed &quot;QuickCheck&quot;, but whether through &quot;ghc-pkg list&quot; or &quot;cabal list --installed&quot;, I cannot find the &quot;QuickCheck&quot; or &quot;Test&quot; package in their lists. But it was installed successfully because I was able to use it by &quot;import Test.QuickCheck&quot;.

                              <span>Hi, we just supported scala serialization in fury 0.3.0 version: https://github.com/alipay/fury . With this release, fury supports all scala 2/3 objects serializaiton now, including: case/pojo/object/option/tuple/collecton/enum and other types. case/pojo/object are tightly integrated with fury JIT. Fury will generate highly-optimized serializer by generate serialize code at runtime to speed up serializaiton. The serialization for those objects will be extremely fast.

 For a long time, scala serialization is always tricky, only fully-reliable way is to use JDK serialization. But it&#x27;s too slow, and the serialized size is too large. Although we have frameworks such as twill, but the support for scala types are limited, and the performance is limited too.Now with fury scala, you can serialize any scala objects you want and get extremly fast performance.Please try it out and let us know if you have any issues.

                              <span>There are many org keybindings which do different things depending on context. I&#x27;ve found this makes it difficult to find what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Example, I forgot how to toggle list bullets. Using the help system, I found a command called org-cycle-list-bullet . Exactly what I was looking for! Unfortunately, according to help it&#x27;s not bound to anything.
 Except actually it is: when on a list, org-ctrl-c-minus (C-c -) does the magic.
 I learned that by pulling up the docs. That&#x27;s fine, but can be slow, and feels against-the-grain so to speak; for this kind of stuff (eg just looking for a keybinding), I prefer to use emacs&#x27; help system.
 Any suggestions on this? Maybe I&#x27;m not using help/search to its full potential. Or maybe going to the docs is the only way?
 ​
 EDIT: I think my post wasn&#x27;t very clear. Maybe this is more clear:
 Given that I know that org-cycle-list-bullet does what I want, and that it is not bound, what is the most efficient way to find that it can be used from C-c -?

                              <span>This is my first foray into org-ql and org-ql-block. I am trying to achieve something that I was able to do in org&#x27;s Block agenda tags-todo views, and I have been largely successful, except ...
 ... In agenda views generated by org&#x27;s block agenda, pressing &lt; narrows the output to the category present under the cursor - meaning, only entries for that category are visible, the rest hidden.
 When I press the same key in blocks generated by org-ql-block, I get a message: org-agenda-filter-by-category: No category at point
 The error message makes sense because the output of org-ql-block does not include the category, whereas the output of tags-todo does.
 Here is an example of output from tags-todo:
 individual-competency-fy24:STARTED [#B] Download course transcript :ATTACH:ActiveTask:
 The leading individual-competency-fy24 is not showing in org-ql-block output.
 So, is another command needed, or do I need to configure org-ql-block to output the category. And if so, how?
 Thanks,
 Mirko

                              <span>I have following the Emacs LSP Mode documentation on adding support for languages, and so far this is what I have achieved in my configuration:
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;lsp-mode (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(arduino-mode . &quot;arduino&quot;)) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp--client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection &#x27;(&quot;arduino-language-server&quot; &quot;-clangd&quot; &quot;clangd&quot; &quot;-cli&quot; &quot;arduino-cli&quot; &quot;-cli-config&quot; &quot;/home//.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml&quot; &quot;-fqbn&quot; &quot;arduino:avr:uno&quot;)) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;arduino&quot;) :server-id &#x27;arduino-language-server))) 
 And this is according to the arduino-language-server documentation.
 My issue here:
  
I am not sure of the server-id, and I don&#x27;t know where to get it.
 When I invoke lsp command, I get connected to whatever I specify in the server-id, but I don&#x27;t get any IDE like functionality.
  
Any help will be much appreciated, and thank you in advance.

                              <span>I have resisted switching to company for a long time and have just been getting by with auto-complete.
 I decided to try out company (still with ac as well) and trying to get it to work the way I like. One thing I notice is that if I complete a word while the point is in the middle of a word it replaces the entire word including text after the point, unlike auto-complete.
 like if I have a line:
 &#x60;someFunction()&#x60;
 and I want to console.log it (in node) I would go to the beginning of the line and start typing
 &#x60;conssomeFunction()&#x60;
 Now if I select &#x60;console&#x60; as the completion, &#x60;someFunction&#x60; gets &quot;deleted&quot;. This is weird behaviour since I think this is a common use case. Adding a space first is unintuitive to me and feels like an extra step.
 Is this configurable? Am I missing something? Or is there something weird going on with my setup?

                              <span>I love using Emacs for R programming. On my new laptop, I&#x27;ve run into a configuration problem.
 I&#x27;ve installed R 4.3.2 on the Windows machine (a HP ZBook running Windows 10 Enterprise). The problem is that when I start R, it starts with version 3.6.1, which obviously is a big problem for me. I figure there&#x27;s got to be some dot-file, environment variable, or something that points to the R interpreter which I can change, but I&#x27;ve had no luck in finding this documented. Can someone help?

                              <span>In the configuration of Emacs, the usage of set-face-* is widespread and omnipresent.
 When it comes to querying fonts, the frequent use of describe-face often perplexes users, as one might expect it to be describe-font.
 However, it wasn&#x27;t until today that I discovered &quot;font&quot; and &quot;typeface&quot; are synonymous. That is to say &quot;typeface&quot; being one type(kind) of faces. This realization instantly increased my inclination to embrace &#x60;set-face&#x60; and &#x60;describe-face&#x60;.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have improved my roam functionalities in integrating some of the functions offered by u/daviwil in his great video and post.
 So listing the tags is not a problem, I also know how to limit the search of node using filetags.
 But is there a possibility to create different categories of tags?
 I an working in the customer support in the IT, and I would like to apply the same functionalities offered for TAGS to another kind of tags (named error_tags).
 I already use the standard tags and filetags, but I need to link and search in my nodes (notes) for error_tags, that are snippets of logfiles with error messages.
 ​
 Is there any &quot;easy&quot; way to do it, or is the only way the creation of a property #+error_tags and the search using the package org-ql from u/alphapapa ?
 Thanks for sharing your opinions on this, or your workflow if you have already solved this problem?

 I&#x27;ve decided to drop Dropbox (;)) and revert to rsync/rsnapshot and removable media. I have a lot of bookmarks in my current-bookmark.el.gpg. I did a replace of &quot;Dropbox&quot; for &quot;sync&quot; (where sync is my mount) but when I save and restart emacs and try to access a bookmark using bmkp, I get:
 ​
  
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Cannot read definitions in bookmark file: Args ou...&quot;) 
 error(&quot;Cannot read definitions in bookmark file: %s&quot; &quot;Args out of range: 0, 7&quot;)

Can anyone shine a light on this please?

                              <span>Hi,
 Manifold Valley is a startup that produces animation data and other assets for game developers by leveraging machine learning. In addition to more standard machine learning tools like Pytorch, we use an embedded domain specific language and compiler written in Haskell to describe distributed data flows involving machine learning processes and game engines. We also build front end software in Haskell using the Monomer library and backend GPU code using a related functional language, Futhark. M.V. is an established team of a dozen developers now in its third year of research with tangible results.
 We are currently seeking a Haskell-centric developer to join our compiler development team. The job involves working on with machine learning engineers, artists and other developers to produce novel machine learning processes that go from controlling physical camera systems to producing finished game assets. Interested candidates should have a deep knowledge of the structure and interpretation of functional languages as well as ample real world Haskell knowledge. 
 Currently accepting resumes at manifoldvalley.com. The mail address begins with my name ian at-symbol. Competitive salary and benefits package. Relocation is possible but this is not a remote position.
 Kind regards.

 https://jobs.lever.co/anduril/80c23e90-ad9a-45b7-82da-ca8c4d5856b5
 ​
 Those with specific interest or experience in Nix/NixOS/Nixpkgs, systems programming, hardware interfaces, numerical programming, or signal processing, might find themselves particularly suitable for this role. If your commercial software engineering experience isn&#x27;t in Haskell or functional programming in particular, but you&#x27;re looking to break into commercial FP, please do get in touch; this is the path the majority of our team took to get where they are today.
 ​
 Our team works entirely on-site in Orange County, California, USA. Due to the nature of the products we are building, time in the lab is critical for our work.

                              <span>So, by Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem no system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an algorithm can provide a proof of it&#x27;s own consistency. Knowing that set theory is one such system, I began to wonder whether it&#x27;s possible to write a program, for which it&#x27;s impossible to prove that it never stops. Such a program, I imagine, would be able to describe set-theoretic theorems as values of some data type, then, given a set of axioms, combine those axioms using logic to form all the theorems of set theory. Then traverse those theorems and check if any of them are equivalent to a negation of one of the axioms, thus proving that set theory is inconsistent and causing the program to halt. For a program like that, you can&#x27;t show that it never stops, because that would require showing that set theory is consistent, which is impossible to do using set theory. The problem is, I have no idea how to write a program like that or where to even start. I thought haskell would be a good choice, because it&#x27;s already pretty close to math. If anyone is interested in this extremely nerdy endeavor, please halp :P

                              <span>There seem to be far fewer Haskell jobs. Several larger Haskell shops have closed or switched to another language. The salaries are not impressive, at all. And the jobs require production experience, making it more or less impossible to break into it that way.
 I have been doing Scala for a while now, but there is so much corruption from Java (idioms, libraries, etc). Finding a Scala shop that is Scala idiomatic, actually functional, cares about quality, and pays really well is a unicorn. Haskell seems like a logical step. But the market appears to say otherwise.
 I know other people, who know Haskell much better than I do, who can&#x27;t get a job doing Haskell. Just seems like putting in the significant effort required to get decently good at it won&#x27;t pay off.

                              <span>Some statically typed languages that have null provide null safety by having a nullable and non-nullable version of each type. The compiler will prevent you from using null when the non-nullable version of the type is expected. You can pass in the plain non-null version of the type into any function that takes in the nullable type. The nullable type is a union between the non-nullable type and null.
 Kotlin is a good example of a language like this. Typescript kinda mostly does it. I don&#x27;t know C# very well but I think the latest version finally fixed the initial nightmare they started with.
 Haskell, on the other hand, has Maybe. Maybe is a sum type, rather than a union type. If a function takes in a Maybe String, then you can&#x27;t pass a String into the function.
 One advantage nullable types have over Maybe is that it&#x27;s backwards compatible to weaken preconditions and strengthen postconditions. 
 If your library has a function
 fun doIt(foo: String): Int?
 Then in the next version, you can change the signature to
 fun doIt(foo: String?): Int
 In a backwards compatible way. In Haskell, changing
 doIt :: String -&gt; Maybe Int
 To 
 doIt :: Maybe String -&gt; Int
 Is a breaking change.
 Is there an advantage to representing optionality as a unique sum type, rather than a nullable union type?

                              <span>Dry now supports basic list, tuple, and dictionary operations.
 Here are some example code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import assert;
 // from-imports aren&#x27;t supported yet let assert_equals &#x3D; assert.assert_equals; let assert_true &#x3D; assert.assert_true;
 // &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; list demo &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; let xs &#x3D; [1, &quot;two&quot;, 3];
 assert_equals(&quot;Stringify lists&quot;, &quot;[1, two, 3]&quot;, str(xs)); assert_equals(&quot;Second element&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, xs[1]);
 xs[0] &#x3D; 10; assert_equals(&quot;Update list&quot;, [10, &quot;two&quot;, 3], xs);
 let ys &#x3D; [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;]; del ys[1]; assert_equals(&quot;Delete a list element&quot;, [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;], ys); assert_equals(&quot;List size&quot;, 2, ys.size());
 assert_equals(&quot;Add new element to the list&quot;, [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;], [&quot;one&quot;].add(&quot;two&quot;));
 // &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; tuple demo &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; let tup &#x3D; (1, true, &quot;three&quot;, false); assert_equals(&quot;Stringify tuple&quot;, &quot;(1, true, three, false)&quot;, str(tup)); assert_equals(&quot;Third element&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, tup[2]);
 // &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; dictionary demo &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; let dict &#x3D; {1: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;: true};
 dict[&quot;two&quot;] &#x3D; false; assert_equals(&quot;Update dictionary&quot;, false, dict[&quot;two&quot;]); assert_true(&quot;New item added&quot;, dict[true] &#x3D; 10); assert_equals(&quot;Size after adding new item&quot;, 3, dict.size());
 del dict[&quot;two&quot;]; assert_equals(&quot;Size after deleting a item&quot;, 2, dict.size()); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 You can probably easily tell that I based them on their Python counterparts. I&#x27;m also planning to add basic FP operations (map, filter, fold, etc.) for these types in the standard library. I think Dry will look great with them because of its support for multi-line lambdas.
 Anyways, here&#x27;s the repo: https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/dry Any questions, feedbacks, bug-reports will be welcomed.

                              <span>Hi, I don&#x27;t understand why the first version of retry in this chapter of Scala with Cats blows up the stack - surely it should at least work with the Option monad, with the function body evaluating to None when f(start) is None and to retry(x)(f) when f(start) is Some(x)? Could somebody explain?

                              <span>Hi! On Nov. 30, we are hosting a workshop both online and in-person during the Functional Scala Conference. In this training, you will learn about parametric polymorphism, higher-kinded types, implicits / givens, type class pattern, Any &amp; Nothing, lambda types, and basic macros. Join us to master the advanced features that make Scala distinct from other JVM languages.
 Whether you want to attend just the workshop or both the workshop and conference, the cost remains the same.

I will introduce myself shortly but later. After Apple Notes received an update and some functions that also benefit a Zettelkasten system, a question: To what extent would Notes be suitable for a ZKS? Is there anyone who organizes themselves exclusively with Notes? Thank you and thank you for the opportunity to choose here.</span>

                              <span>Hallo, I&#x27;m not able to understand how to process the FS2 stream in parallel: On the one hand I want to pass it on as IO, but it should stream in parallel into a file as cache.
 Now I am doing some nonsense like .compile.toList, which is not very efficient. What else can I do? 
 I am not asking for a solution, I am looking forward to ideas and inspiration.
 scala (for { result0 &lt;- Stream.eval(backend.queryDataStream(query, user, pageSize)) // nooooo! rowData &lt;- Stream.eval(result0.data.rows.compile.toList).covary[IO] result &lt;- Stream.eval(IO.pure(DataStreamResult(data &#x3D; result0.data.copy(rows &#x3D; Stream.emits(rowData)), &quot;success&quot;))) // run a fiber with &quot;queryFn&quot; _ &lt;- Stream.eval(queryAndCache( finalFile &#x3D; finalFile, tempCacheFile &#x3D; tempCacheFile, reportPrefix &#x3D; query.reportPrefix, queryFn &#x3D; IO.pure(result), cacheFn &#x3D; CacheStore.writeDataStream )) } yield result).compile.lastOrError

Last time I tried was June and it was a weird bookmark bug in Emacs 29.0.1. Today I tried again and finally make it look like in the screenshot. Without further ado, here is how:
 First. you need to install Roboto Mono and Fira Code as required by NANO for looking as intended:
  
Roboto Mono: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono
 Robot Slab for writer-mode: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab
 Fira Code: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code
  
If you are using Emacs 29 or above, for some reason, NANO requires bookmark-menu-heading to be available; even (require &#x27;bookmark) doesn&#x27;t work. Here i…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone! 🙃
 I copy a lot of files to other places from dired, and one thing I was wondering is: Is there a way for me to use consult-bookmarks or something, which I use a ton, when in the &quot;browse to location in the minibuffer&quot; thing? Basically, if I mark a file I want to copy to ~/Downloads, I hit C in dired, and then the mini buffer pops up with the file path, and I have to manually browse to it. It doesn&#x27;t take too long, but doing it like 30 times a day gets a bit annoying. I have ~/Downloads in my consult-bookmarks and I use that a ton in dired. So is there a way to use that bookmark to instantly browse there when it&#x27;s asking for a destination?
 Please let me know and thx again. 🙃

                              <span>hi, I know this is maybe far fetched, but does such a function / package exist, that show the emacs equivalent binding to any evil binding in the minibuffer? The goal is to learn the emacs bindings progressively (I started with evil mode). thanks for your insights

 For instance, in org-mode tab adds 4 spaces but backspace deletes only one single space. 
 For .rs, .py, etc files it does delete variable number of spaces depending on the context.

 haskell add1 &#x3D; (+) 1  and in that case, I love that I can do that. But the HLS seems to want me to do that everywhere:
 haskell insertionSort :: (Foldable t, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; t a -&gt; [a] insertionSort ls &#x3D; foldr insert [] ls where insert xNew [] &#x3D; [xNew] insert xNew ls@(x:xs) &#x3D; if xNew &lt; x then xNew : ls else x : insert xNew xs  Would y&#x27;all remove the ls or leave it? I like it with because I think its more readable when its more complete but I want to hear from others.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to save/load breakpoints from ghci repl.
 Is it possible ?
 Do you have any solution to load breakpoints automatically for a project (maybe from .ghci) ?
 regards,
 Lajos

                              <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Episode 36 – John Hughes by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode, Matti and Wouter are joined by John Hughes. John is one of the authors of the original Haskell Report and talks about why functional programming matters, the origins of QuickCheck testing, and how higher order functions and lazy evaluation is the key that makes functional programming so productive, and so much fun!

configuration language.
Presenting Nickel: better configuration for less
Programming with contracts in Nickel
Types à la carte in Nickel
Great configurations from little merges grow
We previously looked at the core language, then contracts, and finally typing.
The last important remaining piece to explore is the merge system. In this post,
we’ll see how to use the Nickel merge system to write reusable configuration
modules, and why the merge approach seems to be more adapted for modular
configurations than plain functions, despite Nickel being a functional language.

Programmable configuration

                              <span>This release brings ergonomic improvements for new types and other minor additions.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library bringing type constraints to Scala. You can attach predicates to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Improved RefinedTypeOps
 RefinedTypeOps has been refactored to provide: - Compatibility with future Scala versions - Improvements on RefinedTypeOps companion&#x27;s given instances. They no longer are orphans and no given import should be needed anymore. - New typeclass instances out of the box (e.g TypeTest instances)

Anyway, now I&#x27;ve done this, I am being prompted every single time I open any project file (first time in session) to import the project root. I removed all caches, removed the old project from the lsp worksapce list, but it&#x27;s not remembering. Any ideas?

                              <span>Anyone have experience of emacs installed on the Steamdeck? It runs steamOS, an Arch derivative and KDE Plasma 
 I&#x27;m a doom and org-mode user on most of my devices.
 I think I can install emacs via the &quot;discover&quot; store on my steamdeck, then I presume, unlock the read-only OS and install the doom config in the usual way.
 Will that work ok? Any pitfalls I should be aware of?
 Anything else I should consider, alternative package managers like Nix for example?

 Left Option does work out-of-the-box.
 I also tried to achieve by setting

 but it didn&#x27;t help.

                              <span>I want a file manager to appear on the side of the screen when I open emacs, like you would have in gedit or atom. I am open to using any package or plugin as long as you can tell me what to put in my init file to make it open when I start emacs.
 Update: It looks like I am able to do it with neotree. I added:  (use-package neotree) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;neotree (neotree-show))  Update 2: Per stackowverflow you can do it with treemacs with:  (use-package treemacs) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook &#x27;treemacs)  I still need to open it once, but then it remembers to be open the next time I start emacs. Counterintuitively, it appears that the with-eval-after-load is necessary for it to be open when it starts, in addition to it having been on the last time I closed it.
 Please do not answer if you are not willing to tell me exactly what to put in my init.el file. I have heard of treemacs but I cannot make emacs open with treemacs open.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve just got Emacs 28.1 running on WSL2. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs on Windows for many years and I now want to switch to WSL for the speed benefit. However, I&#x27;d like to keep the ability to run my Windows installation of Emacs, using the same packages and configuration files as my WSL version. 
 The Home directory for my Windows Emacs installation is C:\Dropbox\Home, therefore I added the following lines to the init.el file loaded by the WSL Emacs installation:
 (setq user-init-file &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs&quot;) (setq user-emacs-directory &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs.d&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs.d/elpa&quot;) 
 The first line works, in that it does read the specified .emacs file. However, when it attempts to load some of the packages (specifically those found in C:\Dropbox\Home\.emacs.d\elpa) it fails, saying it cannot find the file or folder specified. 
 I can&#x27;t figure out where it&#x27;s looking for those packages and why it cannot find them despite me adding the package folders to the load-path var. Any help much appreciated.

 Conversely, in the right solarized-light theme, the SVG images display a pleasant light-blue background, offering excellent readability.

 How can SVG images be displayed with a light-blue background in the dark theme, as it is in the light theme?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get Elfeed to work with FreshRSS. I know that the FreshRSS API works correctly because I tested it with an RSS reader on my iPad and iPhone and it syncs correctly with the login/password credentials and the API url.
 However, with Elfeed, I get nothing. I&#x27;m sharing my elfeed setup below in the hopes that someone might let me know if I&#x27;m doing anything wrong.

                              <span>I have the entire elpa directory added into a git repository so that I always have a known good setup that I can fall back on. This works well when I am cloning it in linux machines but when I clone it in windows machines, it doesn’t work.
 I have removed all the .elc files since those are not cross compatible but it still didn’t work and I realise that it’s because the generated autoload file is specified to be using unix style line endings (LF) but when I cloned it in the windows machine, the autoload files will have dos style line endings (CRLF) therefore causing the issue.
 Interestingly, the init file also uses CRLF and it still works presumably because it does not have the same specified coding as the generated autoload files.
 How should I get around this problem? I’m thinking of setting core.autocrlf to false on my windows machine. While that works, I will have to remember to create new files in my .emacs.d with only LF to keep the git repo clean and also presumably for it to work. I also thought about regenerating those autoloads after a clone but I’m not sure how to do so. Hence, I’m looking to see whether others have better solutions to this problem.
 Edit: I realise I can set core.autocrlf to input so that git will automatically convert any CRLF to LF on commit therefore resolving the issue. Regardless, I am still interested to hear from the others who version control their elpa directory on what is their strategy.

                              <span>There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c 
 Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under Task b... only to find its empty.
 A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b 
 The above code shows as:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b 
 Any better solutions?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m learning Scala on Coursera, I&#x27;m getting frustrated with my current issue very early on. I get a compile error for this code &quot;Found: Unit - Required: Boolean&quot;.
 I understand what the error means, basically I am returning void somewhere where I should be returning a Boolean. But I just don&#x27;t see how I am. I&#x27;ve called out all the variables individually to check they all are the types I think they are, and everything just looks fine to me.
 I&#x27;m just counting a List[Char] has the same number of opening and closing braces, I&#x27;ll add functionality to check they actually match later:
 def balance(chars: List[Char]): Boolean &#x3D; checkChar(0, chars) def checkChar(openCount: Int, chars: List[Char]): Boolean &#x3D; val openBrace &#x3D; &quot;(&quot;.toList.head val closeBrace &#x3D; &quot;)&quot;.toList.head val success &#x3D; openCount &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 val newCount &#x3D; if chars.head &#x3D;&#x3D; openBrace then openCount + 1 else if chars.head &#x3D;&#x3D; closeBrace then openCount -1 else openCount if chars.isEmpty then success else checkChar(newCount, chars.tail) // The error is highlighted here 
 The val &quot;success&quot; is a Boolean, and the function checkChar, called recursively, returns a Boolean. Why is it complaining about a Unit?

The highlight of this release is that vty now works on Windows, thanks to hard work by Chris Hackett and Timofey Zakrevskiy! For years, many people in the Haskell community have requested Windows support in vty. Thanks to Chris and Timofey for the time and energy they put into this, and their patience as we worked out an approach! Thanks also to Eric Mertens and Kevin Quick for early feedback on the release.
 In this release, the core &quot;vty&quot; package was reorganized so that support for specific platforms now lives in platform-specific packages that need to be used alongside the core &quot;vty&quot; package. This release includes the release of three aditional new packages:
  
vty-unix (Unix terminal support previously provided by &quot;vty&quot;)
 vty-windows (the Windows backend)
 vty-crossplatform (for when you want to support both)
  
The core package still provides all of the important library functionality and is still a necessary dependency. Applications will need to depend on an additional package for the platform that they need to support. When in doubt, use vty-crossplatform!
 The release changelog update has a detailed listing of changes as well as instructions for how to update your application to work with Vty 6.
 To get help, please open an issue on the Vty repository.
 While I&#x27;m at it, Brick has been updated to use vty-crossplatform in version 2.0!
 Thanks!

                              <span>I had updated to sonoma earlier today on M1 MBA. Emacs became laggy, scrolling through my config file turned into a choppy mess.
 After downgrading back to Ventura, all performance issues were fixed. 
 How to downgrade (in case anyone needs this in the future)
 1. Create Bootable USB Installer and download older macOS version from app store
 2. Make a time machine backup
 3. Reboot into startup options
  
Wipe existing drive, install OS from usb
 
Transfer files from time machine backup.

 I tried searching to see if anyone else had experienced this, but I can&#x27;t find anything. My bad if this is a simple question, but I just haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out.
 It&#x27;s inconvenient, because oftentimes, there is no M-x equivalent of an S-expression, so I have no way to do something that requires a call to an Emacs Lisp function.
 Edit: Solved the problem. Thanks for helping, everyone!See https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/17k6pu4/m_aka_mx_evalexpression_does_nothing_upon_hitting/k76ihco/

                              <span>Hi all, I saw a cool post the other day with a small snippet of code that was asking for reviews. I love the idea and thought I&#x27;d drop in my own little Elisp and ask for the same. This isn&#x27;t a package yet but hoping to make it one. Would love any hints or tips of what&#x27;s expected of a package as I&#x27;ve never made my own and this would be the first. The idea of the package is to have autosave work on an idle timer and trigger immediate save when navigating away in various ways. I&#x27;ve been dogfooding it and so far works great for my needs. Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Suppose that I have a frame with two windows (split vertically). If I now open org-agenda, it takes over the entire frame rather than appearing in one of the windows. Once I close org-agenda I lose the split window configuration. I have figured out how to restore it using winner package, but is it possible to restrict org-agenda to not take the entire frame?

                              <span>I am thinking of moving to mu4e and I was wondering if there is a way to have it group newsletters like &quot;Inbox for Gmail&quot; used to do or like https://sparkmailapp.com does.
 Your regular contacts show up in the inbox and you don&#x27;t have to do much for only real emails appear there. But also real emails from contacts you don&#x27;t know about show up. I assume they read the emails and do some type of automatic filtering. 
 Is this possible in mu4e and if so, now?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to copy images to MacOS Photos App. I know this is probably a rather complex operation, but I also know that there are some die-hard Emacs users out there who use Mac every day. 🍎 So I&#x27;m curious if this is possible? Is there a package? I can&#x27;t seem to find one.
 I&#x27;m just looking for a way to send images via dired directly to MacOS library at the very least. Since I use dirvish to go through photo sets/collections (Color-tagging them with dired-delight), and I find it to be so much faster to do with dired than with a GUI, I&#x27;m just hoping that it&#x27;s possible for emacs to take me &quot;the next step&quot; to moving the marked ones to the photos libraries I have for MacOS. So, any feedback is welcome! thx! 🙃

                              <span>I just noticed that I keep getting the following error when using org-agenda:
 eldoc error: (error ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer # (org-agenda-mode)) 
 So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing any loss of functionality, but I was hoping someone here might be able to point me in the right direction for debugging this.
 Thanks!

                              <span>There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c 
 Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under &#x60;Task b...&#x60; only to find its empty.
 A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b 
 The above code shows as:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b

                              <span>The org-manual states that heading Python chunks with &#x60;:results value table&#x60; (see Python Source Code Blocks in Org Mode) will result in a pandas df being output as an org-table. However, that doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my machine.
 For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src python :results value table
 import pandas as pd data &#x3D; {&#x27;State&#x27;:[&#x27;CA&#x27;, &#x27;TX&#x27;, &#x27;FL&#x27;], &#x27;Pop&#x27;:[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(data) return df
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 results in:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +RESULTS:
 | State Pop | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 whereas I was expecting:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +RESULTS:
 | | State | Pop | |---+-------+----------| | 0 | CA | 39029342 | | 1 | TX | 30029572 | | 2 | FL | 22244823 | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In order to get the above, I currently have to use this hacky solution with the tabluate package:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src python :results value raw :return tabulate(df, headers&#x3D;df.columns, tablefmt&#x3D;&#x27;orgtbl&#x27;)
 from tabulate import tabulate import pandas as pd data &#x3D; {&#x27;State&#x27;:[&#x27;CA&#x27;, &#x27;TX&#x27;, &#x27;FL&#x27;], &#x27;Pop&#x27;:[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(data)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which works as expected. So ... does org-babel support pandas tables and I&#x27;m just doing it wrong, or does it not actually support pandas tables yet?

                              <span>I’ve been happily using org mode for quite awhile now, but this is the first major downside I’ve come across in terms of how it compares to Obsidian. Collectively, these plugins seem to provide a nice way of enforcing a scheme of sorts on your notes and allowing you to surface a dynamic view of your data based on the values of your “schema fields”.
 Does org / org-roam have any analogue to these?

                              <span>Hey. Is anyone able to explain how feasible it is to use GHC as a cross compiler to target Windows x86_64 from a Linux x86_64 host? I know GHC has had some cross compilation abilities for a while but I&#x27;m interested in what the difficulty rating would likely be to use this in production, with modern tools like Stack and GHC 9.x. For context while I understand a bit about how different compiler back ends (such as LLVM) can be used with GHC, things such as trying to build custom instances of GHC from source would score high on my difficulty scale.
 The reason I&#x27;m asking is that I develop a homebrew application that supports Windows and Linux and my Windows machine has suffered a hardware failure, which is serious enough that I may decide to salvage it and build a new machine. I&#x27;m interested in the idea of going Linux only and using cross compilation and WINE as a way to maintain a Windows build environment. Anyway, thanks for reading.

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Haskell with an online course, there was a task to define this fibonacci numbers stream
 fibStream :: [Integer] fibStream &#x3D; 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibStream (drop 1 fibStream) 
 Since lazy evaluation seemed to me do the hard work here I figured I could throw together something similar with Python
 from itertools import islice def fib(): yield 0 yield 1 yield from map(lambda xy: xy[0] + xy[1], zip(fib(), islice(fib(), 1, None))) 
 However, Haskell easily handles even a 1000 elements, while Python is starting to crawl at 31. This doesn&#x27;t look like a tail-call recursion to me. What gives?
 EDIT: all zip, map and islice are lazy AFAIK. fib is a generator function that only evaluates when the next element is demanded.

                              <span>Hi all!
 Thought I would showcase an early version of mouse, a small HTTP server library I have been working on this week.
 The general idea is that it&#x27;s supposed to be small and simple, not fully featured, but it&#x27;s also not supposed to get in your way, that&#x27;s why the &quot;DSL&quot; is pretty heavily ingrained into the regular usage. It also has no dependencies (aside from scalatest).
 I intend on improving things like performance and adding a few features to make it a bit nicer before making it to 1.0. A few things to expect:
  
HTTP Client library
 Route testing library
 WebSocket support
 HTTP 2.0 support
 TLS configuration
  
Please feel free to leave your thoughts and if you find any issues, please feel free to open one.

                              <span>emacs_without_a_keyboard was an interesting read - so how about emacs on chromebooks?
 I had a cursory look at the chromebook keyboard and got scared - is it like Mac where the keys have different names but similar functions? 
 Perhaps there are config changes or packages needed? 
 Perhaps it&#x27;s as different as evil vs holy modes?
 Or is it basically impossible to use emacs on chromebooks?

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 Hope your weekend is off to a great start. I&#x27;m starting my journey on Vim and possibly Emacs (although, who am I kidding, seeing some of its capabilities it seems an inevitability). One thing that would accelerate my timeline to jumping into learning Emacs is if it handled a particular use case that is crucial to me.
 See, I do a lot of work in Jupyter Notebooks (Python) for school and ML/prototyping in general. One thing I like about notebooks is that if you make a mistake and the program fails, well, your intermediate calculations are still stored in memory and accessible. It&#x27;s a graceful fail. If you fail through terminal, well, could be the end of what you calculated. 
 The problem I have with Jupyter Notebooks is that they do not support parallel processing conveniently. I saw that Emacs has some interesting capabilities around notebook support; I believe org mode is what&#x27;s used. 
 I was interested in knowing if anyone uses Emacs as a way to get the best of both worlds: a way to run things using multiprocessing, but should things fail, it store the states in memory to rerun it.
 I appreciate any/all insight you have!

                              <span>Is there a solution for inserting a filename to a buffer (either to a normal buffer, or to the minibuffer) using a recursive fuzzy search, using the vertico + consult + corfu + cape ecosystem? Something like what consult-find does, but instead of opening the selected file, insert the path of it to a buffer.
 We have cape-file, but it doesn&#x27;t fuzzy search in a recursive way.

 wait, it was in the C-c keymap. Let&#x27;s cancel this keybinding by... um... pressing ESC repeatedly?
 C-x ESC ESC: executes (repeat-complex-command)
  
How can one cancel the current key chain in Emacs? I also tried C-x C-g but i get a message C-x C-g is undefined which makes me think that it isn&#x27;t reserved for this kind of purpose.

                              <span>After having used org-agenda just for my todos and scheduled events, I just found out one can use it to search one&#x27;s notes too. It works great! With one bad side-effect. I added several org directories using:
 (setq org-agenda-text-search-extra-files (directory-files-recursively &quot;~/Writer/&quot; &quot;\\.org$&quot;))
 Now, after searching, all the files the agenda had opened to look for my search string have been added to the list of recent files. So (find-file (completing-read &quot;Recent files: &quot; recentf-list)) becomes less useful because it doesn&#x27;t show the latest opened files on top of the list anymore, but instead a complete list of all my org-files.
 Is there a way to prevent agenda search from caching files into recentf-list?
 Thank you very much for any help!

                              <span>Hi Emacs community,
 I&#x27;m an elisp noob, and I recently wrote a function to get the references on a wikipedia page. I plan on using it for org-mode/org-roam so I can do research faster (even though there&#x27;s probably already a package for that sort of thing). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s probably not as robust as I would like to think it is, as some of the dois/isbns appear to be missing in some wikipedia pages I&#x27;ve tested. Here it is for reference:
 (defun get-wikipedia-references (subject) &quot;Gets references for a wikipedia article&quot; (let ((wikipedia-prefix-url &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot;)) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously (concat wikipedia-prefix-url subject)) (let* ((html-start (progn (goto-char (point-min)) (re-search-forward &quot;^$&quot;))) (dom (libxml-parse-html-region (1+ (point)) (…</span>

                              <span>These are a few project ideas that I&#x27;ve had but will probably never get around to so I thought I&#x27;d post them. The general concept is to use existing projects to handle some of the details and make it easier to experiment with the unique features of the language. These ideas also try to avoid a lot of the standard web application implementation details that are usually covered in courses or books.
 ​
  
Write a ui for hledger https://hledger.org/ . One already exists, but if you store the transactions as text blobs in a database and dump out hledger text files based on different things you want to do you could experiment with: 
 Making projections by generating future transaction entries
 Running &quot;what if&quot; scenarios by filtering out past transactions and replacing them with generated transactions
 Different ways of tagging/categorizing/automating transactions 
 
 Write a toy version of Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/ . Create a file format that describes a set of containers, read the file format, and use the shell &#x60;docker&#x60; (or &#x60;podman&#x60;) command to poll/start/stop the containers. You can experiment with different ways to start up different subsets of containers, ways of swapping different types of containers for different roles ...etc.
 Write a ui for MegaMek https://megamek.org/ . One already exists but mostly the idea is to use the existing game rules implementation and focus on experimenting with language features. Not sure how feasible this one is.
 Implement the ActivityPub protocol to create a Mastodon server. Not sure how good this one is for learning but there are probably a lot of interesting choices to make.

 I will let you be the judge of that, and I accept any and all criticism. I wish to know what I could do to make this look even more idiomatic. Go ham!
 Since I now use recursion instead of loops, and the way I handled certain statements, it is not exactly the same as my last version, but it plays virtually the same.
 The code feels much less verbose and much cleaner now. I love it, but I&#x27;m sure I can do better with a second refactor after gaining some insight again!
 I still feel like I&#x27;m underutilizing certain things like Option, but it&#x27;s a step up.

                              <span>Hi
 I have picked Scala as my first language, but am unable to find any courses/ resources that focus on functional programming for absolute beginners i.e. people who have no background in programming at all. There are beginner level courses that teach Scala with OOP. Courses/resources that teach functional style assume experience in Java or some other language. Why are there no Scala functional programming courses/resources for absolute beginners?

 Coming from mainly Python, I decided to look into Scala after having dabbled in some Ocaml and Haskell. I am still very FP-curious and my Python-code is starting to be cluttered with maps and reductions, not to mention lambdas. Scala looks to be very elegant, aesthetically and otherwise.
 I recently made tic-tac-toe in Python for a Uni introductory programming course, so that&#x27;s what I tried to make here, having barely looked at the &#x27;getting started&#x27;-docs.
 import scala.io.StdIn.readLine import Math.floorMod case class Pos(val x: Int, val y: Int): def fromInput: Pos &#x3D; Pos(floorMod(x-1, 3), floorMod(3-y, 3)) end Pos class Board: private var b: List[List[Int]] &#x3D; { for i &lt;- 0 until 3 yield { for j &lt;- 0 until 3 yield 0}.toList }.toList def board: List[List[Int]] …</span>

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I discovered that sociologists who study leisure classify me as a Literary Leisure Hobbyist. I had no idea. My PKM work feeds that part of my persona.
Rucking as an old man
How my Blind-side Bias develops and the effect it has on me.
If you do what so few people do, what you do can have superlinear performance returns.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Calvino, Italo. Invisible Cities. 2013.
Attia, Peter and Gifford, Bill. Outlive: the science &amp; art of longevity. 2023.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Peter Pearson
Jazz Saxophone Playlist

                              <span>Probably better for r/showerthoughts - but is anyone using emacs without a keyboard?
 I assume the core audience of emacs is devs and sysadmins (and perhaps academics with org and org roam) 
 But surely somebody somewhere is doing those jobs / using assistive tech (dragon etc?) to interface with emacs?

                              <span>I came across citar, and I am trying to use citar-org-roam to take notes on academic papers. I must be missing something about usage/configuration. I get &quot;Make sure &#x27;citar-notes-paths&#x27; and &#x27;citar-file-note-extensions&#x27; are non-nil&quot; when I try to use citar-open-notes. If I set the &#x27;citar-notes-paths&#x27; variable, then citar creates normal notes without using the template defined above.
 Here&#x27;s what is in my init.el:
 (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory &quot;~/RoamNotes&quot;) (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t) (&quot;n&quot; &quot;literature note&quot; plain &quot;* Heading\n %?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%(expand-file-name (or citar-org-roam-subdir \&quot;\&quot;) org-roam-directory)/${citar-citekey}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${citar-citekey} (${citar-date}). ${note-title}.\n#+created: %U\n#+last_modified: %U\n\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t))) :bind ((&quot;C-c n l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c n f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c n g&quot; . org-roam-graph) (&quot;C-c n i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert) (&quot;C-c n c&quot; . org-roam-capture) (&quot;C-c n j&quot; . org-roam-dailies-capture-today) :map org-mode-map (&quot;C-M-i&quot; . completion-at-point)) :config (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat &quot;${title:*} &quot; (propertize &quot;${tags:10}&quot; &#x27;face &#x27;org-tag))) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) (require &#x27;org-roam-protocol)) (use-package citar :custom (citar-bibliography &#x27;(&quot;~/bib/referencess.bib&quot;)) :hook (LaTeX-mode . citar-capf-setup) (org-mode . citar-capf-setup)) (use-package citar-org-roam :after (citar org-roam) :config (setq citar-org-roam-note-title-template &quot;${author} - ${title}&quot;) (setq citar-org-roam-capture-template-key &quot;n&quot;) (citar-org-roam-mode))

                              <span>I am trying to replace straight with Elpaca but I have some troubles with loading some of my local packages that are not from Melpa.
 The use-case is to load laas a package for latex snippets. I use the following code
 ​
 (use-package aas :elpaca nil :load-path (lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory)) ) (use-package laas :elpaca nil :load-path (lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory)) :config (aas-set-snippets &#x27;laas-mode ;; set condition! :cond #&#x27;texmathp ; expand only while in math &quot;On&quot; &quot;O(n)&quot; &quot;O1&quot; &quot;O(1)&quot; ;; bind to functions! &quot;Sum&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\sum_{$1}^{$2} $0&quot;)) &quot;Span&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\Span($1)$0&quot;)) &quot;lr(&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left($0\\right)&quot;)) &quot;lr[&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left[$0\\right]&quot;)) &quot;lr{&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left\\{$0\\right\\}&quot;)) ) (laas-mode) ) 
 ​
 Both files &#x60;aas.el&#x60; and &#x60;laas.el&#x60; are in my &#x60;(lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory))&#x60; durectory and with straight these lines of code worked well but when I switched to Elpaca, laas was not loaded anymore. I tried to add :after tex, do not change anything. I tried to add a hook for latex mode and it also do not change, the laas package is not even loaded.
 Can someone help me with this please?

 (leader-key &quot;w&quot; elfeed)
 Is it possible to combine the two in a simple way? I tried using :general keyword in use-package ensuring that it loads after general, but it still does not work...
 Below is what I tried.
  (use-package elfeed :after general :general (:prefix &quot;M-m&quot; &quot;w&quot; #&#x27;elfeed))

 UPDATE: Thank you all for answers. I&#x27;ve worked around this issue by removing parts of the custom-theme-set-faces! and editing color values directly in the
 I still don&#x27;t understand how faces/fonts and their styles are supposed to work in emacs, but I&#x27;m in the middle of transition from KDE wayland to Hyprland and there are already way way way too many issues to deal with. Fingers crossed this won&#x27;t break this time.

                              <span>According to the GitHub page, the org-journal package does not (yet) support having multiple journals. But the author does say:
  
But it should be possible to switch the value of org-journal-directory using a custom function or directory local variables.
  
Has anyone done this, or something similar? I currently use journaling for most (generally basic) notes, but I am also working on a research project for which I&#x27;d like to keep the related journal entries co-located with the project files. That is, my &quot;primary&quot; journal is kept on Dropbox, but I&#x27;d like the project journal to be in the GitHub repo I&#x27;ve set up.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m interested and new to learn the Clash for hardware development but I don&#x27;t have any functional programming experience. Thus, I jumped started from what the following article taught. First, it&#x27;s to install the stack and run the Clash over the stack as shown below.
 However, it seems the Clash version is really old. If I&#x27;d like to use latest Clash version which it may have latest library, what should I do? I&#x27;ve already install the following version and works in my Ubuntu environment. On top of that, is there any online cloud-based way to run Clash? Thank you

                              <span>So my BT keyboard + trackpad is looking worse for wear.
 It was cheap and cheerful with a winning form factor. Other KBs came and went, but it survived.
 I need a replacement.
 It&#x27;s been used with emacs (DooM) with my tablet and / or phone for a few years, and has a few shortcomings (see yellow sticker).
 I now also have a SteamDeck, which is basically an Arch box, and I&#x27;d love a BT keyboard with that.
 Does anyone have a portable setup they&#x27;d like to share? 
 Also, is there an emacs-y way to lisp my way out of things like:
  
keys being missing (#);
 ESC being on a function layer?

I&#x27;m wondering if it would be possible to speed it up using some other tool such as &#x60;fd&#x60;. I noticed that the consult README talks about &#x60;consult-fd&#x60; but I cannot locate that function anywhere in my version which is I think the latest &#x60;0.35&#x60;. Can anyone help with this?
 Also, similarly, consult-grep is a bit slow. Wondering if one can swap in &#x60;ag&#x60; for example?

I have to kill and yank the heading to get it working again. I pasted some of my init file below incase that helps.
  
I&#x27;ve tried this with flyspell disabled and get the same results, so i think it is an ispell issue.
 I have also tried this with emacs -q and running M-x ispell and get the same issue. 
 I&#x27;m using emacs+ on mac

                              <span>I wrote this little library to get a fast Haskell implementation of the Myers diff algorithm, which serves as the base of most diffing tools today. This version is basically an adaptation of some Python code from this excellent post, using as many performance tricks as I can.
 It has QuickCheck tests and I&#x27;ve just added some benchmarks to compare it to the existing Diff library. For any performance wizards out there, the core code is quite short and can be found here -- PRs welcome!

                              <span>When you are using a FUNCTOR you are mapping CATEGORIES. Think about that.
 You can think about.. each functor having one category for each argument/result.
 Let&#x27;s describe an arbitrary functor: FunOf (-&gt;) (:~:) () F, this notation describes the categories that F maps.
 The functor F maps three source categories (-&gt;), (:~:) @Type, () using the mapping function mapF:
 F :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | | (-&gt;) (:~:) () @Type mapF :: (a -&gt; a&#x27;) -&gt; (b :~: b&#x27;) -&gt; (c  (F a b c -&gt; F a&#x27; b&#x27; c&#x27;) 
 Each category maps its respective argument/result: 
 F (a :: Type) (b :: Type) (c :: Type) &#x3D; (res :: Type) | | | | (-&gt;) (:~:) () | | | | v v v v F (a&#x27; :: Type) (b&#x27; :: Type) (c&#x27; :: Type) &#x3D; (res&#x27; :: Type) F F (a :: Type) -&gt; (a&#x27; :: Type) (b…</span>

                              <span>So first off here&#x27;s the code
 import scala.collection.parallel.CollectionConverters._
 import scala.util.Random
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; {
 val size &#x3D; 1000000
 val tests &#x3D; 5
 val lists &#x3D; for _  x)
 (xs.min to xs.max).par.flatMap(cnts.getOrElse(_, List.empty)).seq
 }
 ​
 the sorting algorithm essentially just groups the input by the identity function and then flatMaps all the groups in order by key. The problem is though when I run this code, the first test finishes and then subsequent tests significantly outperform the first one normally by a factor of 2 or 3. For example on the most recent time I ran this the output was 1632, 904, 696, 605, 722. My only guesses as to why this is are either a caching issue, an issue with System.currentTimeMilis(), or perhaps the compiler being smart about how much space it allocates for the map on subsequent tests based on results from previous tests, but I really have no clue and am wondering if someone has a better guess than me.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I am a recruiter at a Signify Technology. I am sure most of you are familiar with us and have been reached out to by one or more of my co-workers in the past for a job.
 The market this year has a been a complete rollercoaster this year, with a ton of layoffs across the entire tech industry and people are struggling to find another role inside the Scala space. Because of the current market conditions, we have noticed inconsistencies between the skills of the engineers vs the compensation packages offered to candidates in this market.
 Therefore, we are conducting an anonymous survey surrounding compensation packages so we can get accurate data to reflect on from last year to see what the difference is. This is completely anonymous, requires no identifying information and only takes roughly 3 minutes to complete.
 If you have the time, we encourage you to take the survey and appreciate any responses to it. Thanks again and enjoy the rest of your day!
