                              <span>I am really sorry to ask this question, as there are already a lot of answers given, but I feel that none of them are definite and give the whole answer (in a clear and easy to follow way)
 I am looking for setting up auto-complete capabilities and code checking in emacs. I mostly want this for Python and C++, although having the capability to easily add other languages in the future would be much appreciated.
 What packages do you recommend for setting up emacs as an ide?

                              <span>I would like to bind C-h/j/k/l to move emacs windows (evil normal mode). 
 Binding globally, every one of these works except C-k. It will NOT move to the upper window in either Eshell or term, normal mode or no. I tried to use bind* from use-package, I tried general, I tried so many things I&#x27;ve lost count, but I can&#x27;t use C-k for the real shell or the Eshell. Why is this, and is there a sane way around it? For now I&#x27;ve settled down on using arrows:
  (general-define-key :states &#x27;normal &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-left &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-right &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-down &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-up) 
 But I am not happy about it. Doubly so because I just don&#x27;t understand why no override works.

But I don&#x27;t want to have to ⌘-TAB (or ALT-TAB in Windows) over to emacs and then C-c c to org-capture. That takes too much time and breaks my flow. I just want to press some magic MacOS (or Windows) key that will automagically switch me to emacs AND do the org-capture command.
 Bonus points if doing the above can also automatically carry over the URL that I&#x27;m currently on.
 I assume I&#x27;d need to use some kind of &quot;macro&quot; software.

                              <span>Cross post from https://fillian.me/code/bongo-retag/
 ​
 bongo is a package for listening to music within Emacs.
 I keep all my music on my computer with filenames readable by bongo like this:
 Artist - Album - Track Num - Song Name.mp3
 ​
 I like having all the metadata stored in the filename instead of in internal ID3 tags for a few reasons:
  
filenames are easy to change
 everything is visible at a glance
 it stops me from spending too much time re-tagging and organizing my library
  
​
 The problem is that when I sync my music library to my phone using Syncthing, the music app I use doesn&#x27;t read the metadata from the filename - it uses the standard ID3 tags.
 ​
 My solution was to write a small script which reads metadata from the filename and overwrites the internal ID3 tags to match.
 Whenever I add new music to my library, I&#x27;ll run this script and then I&#x27;ll be able to browse easily on my phone. The source of truth for metadata will always be the filename.
 ​
 The script is written in Python and requires a library called eyeD3
 You can find the it here
 Pass the script a directory and it will re-tag all the .mp3 files inside and in any sub-directories.
 ​
 It&#x27;s nice to have album cover images when listening on my phone, so the script will overwrite a cover image if there is a file that matches Artist - Album.jpg in the same directory as the mp3.

 1. a backend (lsp-mode in his case)
 2. a frontend (typescript-mode in his case)
 3. a language server (ts-ls in his case)
 So I was wondering if this scheme holds true even for c/c++, if so, what packages for these three &quot;categories&quot; do I need?

                              <span>Hi Emacsers,
 recently I&#x27;ve been playing with org-element and org-export.
 Specifically, I was interested in the mechanism of the org exporter system and its flexibility.
 The goal of this post is to get you started with the creation of org backends.
 To do so, we build an org backend that:
  
keeps only bold elements,
 surrounds bold elements with *** before and after,
 surrounds paragraph elements with :: before and after,

                              <span>Maybe there&#x27;s a package for this already or some clever solution?
 I want to have 2 (vertical) buffers open with the same file, with the right buffer containing what comes just after the bottom of left buffer.
 Then when I scroll in either buffer, the other will move too, so that I&#x27;m always seeing one long(er) continuous portion of the file on my laptop&#x27;s unrotatable wide-ass screen.
 Does that even make sense? Thanks for reading!

 Is there a way to do a generic path? I&#x27;m using nix to install my emacs packages, so, I need a generic way to do this that will work whenever the path changes, nix uses new hashes for unique identities for packages.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 Basically, I wanted ibuffer &amp; projectile to generate a list of projects on startup that I could combine with my own list of filters so that stuff inside a project gets grouped together, and all the stuff not in a project is grouped in ways that&#x27;s useful to me instead of all just ending up under Default.
 Oh, and before I share the code I should say that I am by no means a lisp or elisp expert; this is just the result of an afternoon&#x27;s worth of hacking on lisp to try and get it to do what I want.

                              <span>https://github.com/xl666/avy-conf/blob/main/avy.org
 Some months ago I read the excellent article &quot;Avy can do anything (https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/), which changed the way I use Avy and Emacs in general. The article basically explains what are Avy actions and how to create new ones. This got me inspired to create my own Avy actions, which I&#x27;d like to share with the community in the form of a literate config.
 The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):
 ​
 - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.
 - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.
 - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate
 - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region. I also use this for creating a replace action, combining kill and yank actions in one action.
 ​
 I hope this results useful for someone.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used them infrequently enough and used different ones every time. And then when I ask people about it, I get 10x different answers. 
 I just want a simple (synchronous) HTTP client and JSON parser (where I can make case classes to extract what I need). Now when I look I try one out and the example doesn&#x27;t compile in 2.11, or I try another one out and the client is overkill, etc. 
 I have interviews next week, and I just want the simplest go-to HTTP Client/json parser that I don&#x27;t have to think too hard about. There are so many options that this becomes a really frustrating exercise. 
 Kind of a rant, but also a cry for help.

 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have a pretty basic need to view the stdout of this process (i.e. view numbers from 1 to 10 printed out to an external buffer, much like async-shell-command), not only the final result.
 Is this feasible to do this? If this were feasible it would be convenient to view the process of my long-running command. And I can totally live free from the terminal.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a program that transcodes financial statements into a ledger. In that program I have types representing different activities:
 haskell data Withdrawal &#x3D; Withdrawal { wTarget :: !Text, wAmount :: !Cash, wBalance :: !Cash } data Fee &#x3D; { fFee :: !Cash, fBalance :: !Cash } -- many more 
 I use those types, because I have functions that are transaction-type specific.
 I also wanted to write an activity parser that translates CSV records into those types, so I created an Activity sum type:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Activity &#x3D; ActivityFee Fee | ActivityWithdrawal Withdrawal | -- ...
 parseActivity :: CsvRecord -&gt; Activity &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 That Activity is quite boilerplate&#x27;y. Having to have a new Activity* constructor for a new activity type is slightly cumbersome.
 Is there a more idiomatic or better design pattern for this problem? Was it C++, std::variant would be convenient, because adding a new activity type wouldn&#x27;t entail adding a new boilerplate constructor.
 I&#x27;ve considered type-classes, but the problem with them is that they are not closed and I can&#x27;t pattern match to create a function like applyActivity :: Activity -&gt; Wallet -&gt; Wallet. I see that I could make applyActivity into a function of an Activity class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern. If we had two arguments like foo :: (ClassOne a, ClassTwo b) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c, then it&#x27;s not clear to which class foo should belong.

 I&#x27;m trying to teach someone what a function is conceptually beyond just (a -&gt; b), so that they can recognize it when they see it in any context, regardless of language. I have been trying to come up with a type, or a diagram, to explain it.
 The essential pieces I see for a function are a parameter assignment, a computation, and a return. The type at the top is meant to capture these and the diagram for this would be a square.
 I also think that this can be used to define an arrow, except the first argument would be an identity on the input, the second the arrow, and the third argument would be an identity on the output.
 This is how I sketch functions and arrows when I imagine them but I don&#x27;t know if anyone else&#x27;s imagination agrees.

 Since my last post in this Reddit, it has got some new features, of which probably the most interesting is to remove read-only status, but still keep org markup hidden. It is meant for simple edits like fix a spelling mistake or add/remove a word or two. For bigger edits, drop back into org-mode. There are some other minor additions, hiding some agenda keywords and ellipses. The last one is not really recommended, but it can be useful only in some very special cases.
 For the usage info, check the README file in the Github repository.

                              <span>Dear community,
 I&#x27;m looking for a comparison of the various note-taking-packages implementing the Zettelkasten-method. I don&#x27;t want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.
 Using org, I&#x27;m naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can&#x27;t get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn&#x27;t integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn&#x27;t seem to have a large userbase. 
 Currently, I&#x27;m try out both of these very different options, but I can&#x27;t really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it). Which horse should I put?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have come to the conclusion that despite its excellent keystroke and plug-in customizations, vim still requires a lot of work to get simple development tools working inside of it. 
 Anyway, are there any good starting resources to help me learn more about emacs and also smoothen my transition?
 What have I tried so far? - emacs tutorial - have looked at evil, but haven’t tried it. Is it good?
 Any other help is welcome. Also, you can delete this if it is a repost. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>My setup usually has two side by side buffers open. When I invoke embark-act it takes over the other buffer to show its suggestions. It would make more sense to open as an (extended) minibuffer instead. I looked at the documentation but haven&#x27;t found a setting.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 After a recent update(?), this function no longer works. I have tried taking SVG out of the list of inline image formats in ox-html, but it just inlines the file with a tags. The transclusion of the full source is not happening.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I use ivy-postframe and it works great 99% of the time. There is an issue, however, when I have two windows side-by-side in i3-gaps and open a search (for example for a file). When I start typing, emacs for some reason starts putting what I type at the beginning of the line _ (1/79) Find file: ~/ instead of the end of the line. This is super annoying. The issue goes away if I put emacs on full screen mode.
 Does anyone know of a solution or why this is happening?

                              <span>EDIT: THIS HAS BEEN ANSWERED, THANKS!
 I&#x27;m a newbie. From: https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html
 It says the following:
 You must insert a comma right before lines starting with either ‘*’, ‘,*’, ‘#+’ or ‘,#+’ 
 Is this a mistake in the text? Why would I need to put a comma before a line starting with ,*? I&#x27;d end up with ,,*.
 Then they give the following example:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ,* I am no real headline #+END_EXAMPLE 
 But wouldn&#x27;t it be sufficient without the begin end?
 ;; This will work too ,* I am no real headline 
 For that matter, wouldn&#x27;t it be sufficient to have just about any character there, including a space? 
 ;; This will work too * I am no real headline 
 EDIT: It just occurred to me that I&#x27;m thinking mainly in terms of how emacs is parsing and presenting the information within the editor as I type, but there might be other issues with the system processing the text, such as for agendas, exporting, etc.

                              <span>Hi there,
 This is a screen shot from part of my FastMail IMAP email inbox in Mu4e.
 Lots of inbox email headers, each crossed out, but still listed in the inbox.
 All of these emails have been archived or moved via the MacOS Mail program, or iOS Mail app but they show up like this here, which means that they have been trashed from Mu4e&#x27;s perspective.
 I&#x27;m trying to work out how to make my Mu4e display consistent with what iPhone or Mac Mail shows me. I.E. If I archive an email in iOS Mail, the reference to it is no longer displayed in Mu4e so that I don&#x27;t have to do everything twice.
 I have followed this setup pretty much exactly but applied to FastMail.
 Can somebody point in the right direction please?

I just made a video on the process of creating knowledge using an analog Zettelkasten.

                              <span>Hey guys.
 I&#x27;m trying to get started with Reflex/Obelisk as we have a few quite simple UI use-cases that would benefit highly from sharing code between the front-end and back-end.
 However, struggling to get one thing working - HLS.
 Setting up an Obelisk project was actually remarkably easy.
 ob shell, ob run and ob watch work perfectly.
 However, when I open up VS code from within the nix-shell hls is failing with some very weird errors.
  Unexpected usage error can&#x27;t load .so/.DLL for: /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version &#x60;GLIBC_2.29&#x27; not found (required by /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so)) typecheck 
 I assume this is because it&#x27;s reaching for my local installation of haskell-language-server (it&#x27;s pointed to the 8.6.5 version, so that&#x27;s not the issue), but absolutely no idea how to approach this.
 Is there some working repository example or a tutorial for IDE integration that doesn&#x27;t require you to know Nix in order to make any sense of it?

                              <span>I am interested to get Haskell onto PowerPC. From what I understand the last version existing as ready-made binary is 6.10.x. Is it possible to build recent GHC for ppc somehow?
 I have gcc11 working on ppc, latest cmake and most of other tools. (What does not work on ppc is clang.)
 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Ideally I wanna get GHC for ppc into Macports, but if I manage to build it locally, I can open a PR.
 UPD. In fact, there is a binary on GHC 7.0.1 for PowerPC: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_0_1.html#macosxppc

                              <span>Hello, I need to create a document that uses the tex-metrix package and I was wondering if Org mode can be used for that. I mean to type LaTeX code in the Org document https://www.ctan.org/pkg/metrix
 Or should I use the TeXstudio Editor instead? Thank you.

                              <span>So, I am back with my persistent request to you fellow Scala users to &quot;Star&quot; some projects on Github.
 Why ? 
 Because the &quot;Github Stars&quot; have somehow evolved into the easiest available indicator of popularity and trustworthyness of a project.
 And yes, I know that &quot;Github Stars&quot; are not really a good indicator of quality and trust. And they were just meant to be like a bookmark.
 But probably even the Github guys did not foresee the open-source explosion which took place in last 5-6 years and Github became the de-facto home for opensource community. With the rise of &quot;the like/subscribe culture&quot; of Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn during these times, our community was also craving for that &quot;like/follow/subscribe&quot; button, and they found the &quot;Star button&quot;.
 Yes, it is a bad indicator but an indicator none the less.
 ​
 So, please take few seconds of your time to hit that &quot;like/follow/subscribe&quot;. It might just help in giving outsiders more confidence in our excellant ecosystem.

                              <span>Hi,
 I think Persistent-odbc is the only version that can work with MSSQL, but persistent-odbc doesn&#x27;t pair with newer versions of Persistent as Persistent updated its datatypes. I thought selda was neat, but its DB language metatypes (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the right name) are in a closed data type rather than an open typeclass declaration. MSSQL has many database column types so having type class declarations of the translation DB language metatype would allow for more flexibility for the ORM to handle multiple databases.
 I&#x27;m going to try to rewrite selda&#x27;s types to handle extensible column definitions.

                              <span>Hi, I was reading through Category Theory for Programmers, and I was wondering if the monadic bind &gt;&gt;&#x3D; :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b can be defined in terms of the kleisli arrows: &gt;&#x3D;&gt; :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c) . After a bit, I came up with:  (&gt;&#x3D;&gt;) :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c) (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; ((\_ -&gt; ma) &gt;&#x3D;&gt; f) id -- apply to it a junk value 
 Since the result of applying &gt;&#x3D;&gt; returns a function, I need to call the function with a junk value to make it return just m b . Was I correct in my approach? Thank you.

                              <span>I am trying to implement a BST in Haskell, but I can&#x27;t figure out how lists work in Haskell. So the algorithm would add a node and for each node two empty lists that denote it&#x27;s two subtrees. However, I am stuck at initializing a BST in the first place. So when I insert a number into an empty BST:
 insert 5 [] 
 it would return a list like so:
 [5, [], []] 
 This is what I have:
 insert x lis &#x3D; if null lis then [x, [], []] else undefined --for now 
 I thought the function declaration would have to be:
 insert :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer] 
 But that doesn&#x27;t work. If you know how to solve this, I would also appreciate reference material where these things are covered. I am struggling to find relevant documentation.

 Today, though, I&#x27;m trying to install the yesod bin following the Yesod quickstart guide, and not having any luck. (I&#x27;m in a Rosetta terminal and adding --arch x86_64 to stack commands.)
 The error occurs at the step of installing the yesod command line tool (step 3); this fails with:
 : can&#x27;t load framework: Cocoa (not found) 
 Is it even possible to work with the yesod command line tool on an M1? If so, am I just making some boneheaded mistake?
 EDIT: Problem kinda solved! See comment for what I did.

In addition to the part included in the example, I found this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38184/org-mode-ignore-heading-when-exporting-to-latex and added this to my config: (require &#x27;ox-extra) (ox-extras-activate &#x27;(ignore-headlines)) and I added titletoc to my default packages as well. This indicates ‏‏‎ that titletoc has to be included before the hyperref package. This is what my packages setup looks like: (setq org-latex-default-packages-alist &#x27;((&quot;rm&quot; &quot;roboto&quot; t) (&quot;defaultsans&quot; &quot;lato&quot; t) (&quot;&quot; &quot;paracol&quot; t) (&quot;&quot; &quot;titletoc&quot; t))) There&#x27;s no reference to the hyperref package anywhere in the file, but the output file indicates that package hyperref has indeed been loaded. Could the issue be that titletoc is not loading before hyperref, and if so, how can I make it do that? If that is not the issue, any ideas on what troubleshooting I can try next? Thanks all!

They still don&#x27;t support the count argument and the current region, but they work fine for the trivial cases and are already saving me lots of keystrokes. Hope they are useful to someone else!
 Oh, and as I was learning and doing at the same time, I&#x27;m pretty sure lots of things can be improved. I&#x27;m open for your feedback and suggestions! Thanks.
 A bit of background
 About 2.5y ago I was using C# and Visual Studio at work, and after playing around with Vim for a few months I got to know this Evil mode thing and decided to give Emacs a try (or more specifically, Spacemacs). Since then, I&#x27;ve been learning how to, and using …</span>

 (use-package vertico :straight t :custom (vertico-resize nil) (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode) :config (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/vertico/extensions&quot;) (require &#x27;vertico-mouse) (vertico-mouse-mode) ) 
 Note that vertico-mouse-mode isn&#x27;t available in vertico.el, but requires vertico-mouse.el.
 I&#x27;m using straight.el (btw), so I don&#x27;t like at all the require statement here. Is there any other way I could load the package?

                              <span>This is a general question but my specific problem is actually a Rust related one. 
 By default rustic mode provides a function rustic-cargo-run which calls cargo run without any arguments. I am testing a CLI I created and would like to provide arguments to my run command. I found a function called rustic-run-cargo-command, which has this as it&#x27;s description: &quot;Start compilation process for &#x27;cargo run&#x27; with optional RUN-ARGS&quot;. 
 But i cannot seem to find a way to provide these optional arguments. Can anyone guide me on this issue? For example If I want to run &#x27;cargo run -n test&#x27;, I would try calling M-x rustic-run-cargo-command -n test but this will not work. 
 The function definition can be found here.
 Thank you for your help.

 I tried Udemy, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything useful on there.
 I am rather limited in terms of free time, having young children and a busy career.
 Can someone on here please recommend a way for me to make progress with learning eLisp from nearly scratch?
 I have a few years of Java experience, so am well familiar with basic concepts.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pycharm/visual studio user, but recently vim caught my eye. While figuring out of vim was what I wanted I kept seeing these &quot;vim vs emacs&quot; yt videos and articles, which got me to check out emacs, which at the time looked very similar to vim (to my &quot;mouse focused gui&quot;-using eyes). After some digging i found distro tubes video on doom emacs which really sold me, but here&#x27;s the issue: although it&#x27;s relatively easy to find content telling you why to use emacs, there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any content telling you how to use emacs. 
 I really feel like I&#x27;ve walked into a car showroom, been shown this cool, futuristic car with no visible doors or windows. But as soon as I said &quot;cool, how do I get into it, so I can test drive it?&quot; The salesman just started starting blankly at me as if I&#x27;m the weirdo for not already knowing. 
 This post was mainly to express my woes, but I am very open to being directed to resources on how to get started, especially seeing it up for c# and python.

                              <span>Hey there,
 So Command + V in iTerm2 is the paste action.
 However, I tried looking in the settings but am unaware of how to remap the default paste option since I swap a few keys on my Emacs setup on MacOS.
 Related swaps:
 Caps --&gt; Control
 Option --&gt; Control
 Is it possible to nuke the default Command + V &#x27;paste&#x27; keybinding in iTerm2 for Emacs?
 This interferes with normal Emacs keybindings since Command + V on my setup on normal Emacs on MacOS usually advances the screen by 1 screenful.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m writing some functionality in elisp which only works when I step through the expressions using Edebug and &quot;space&quot; but it fails when running in a regular manner. I know where the script fails in terms of a specific line, I just don&#x27;t know of a mechanism in which the outcome is different due to stepping vs. regular run. Here is the code:
 (defun df/cite () (interactive) (defvar df/cite-title &quot;&quot;) (defvar df/cite-buffer (current-buffer)) (org-ref-insert-cite-link) (org-ref-open-citation-at-point) (setq df/cite-title (bibtex-autokey-get-field &quot;title&quot; bibtex-autokey-titleword-change-strings)) (switch-to-buffer df/cite-buffer) (end-of-visual-line) (backward-char) (insert (format &quot;[%s]&quot; df/cite-title)) (end-of-visual-line)) 
 The code lets you insert an org-ref citation and uses the article&#x27;s title (from the bibtex) entry as the org link description. The script works line by line in edebug but fails as a whole on the line running &quot;open-citation-at-point&quot;. Not sure why.

                              <span>I would like a way to shorten/abbreviate filenames in the Emacs mini-buffer when copying/moving files in Dired. For e.g. if I mark a file in Dired to be moved, its name appears in the minibuffer asking me to choose a destination. The filename is sometimes long and I have to press the up arrow several times. I would like to shorten it so that the name all fits on one line.

 I can edit it just fine, but it&#x27;s bugging me. Oh I also just now tried finding a new non-existent file abc.org, and it does the same thing.

                              <span>Currently, I got python/jupyter working nicely in emacs with Emacs-Ipython-Notebook and Elpy(things like matplotlib render nicely in emacs/ein), but 1 thing that I haven&#x27;t figured out yet, is does emacs/ein currently suppport pywidgets/ipythonwidgets(browser widgets)? I can get ipywidgets to run, but instead of it displaying a browser widget in emacs/ein, it only displays a variable&#x3D;value of the widget hat I&#x27;m trying to render?
 Any tips to fix this browser widget issue in emacs/emacs-ipython-notbook(or jupyter-emacs as well)?
  
I&#x27;m very happy with using emacs-ipython-notebook and and jupyter-emacs in emacs, but, the last thing that I need to get working is browser widgets, then I should be good to go with python/jupyter projects in emacs.

                              <span>Magit has a philosophy of making everything explorable. You don&#x27;t just see a diff; you can jump to the file from the diff. You don&#x27;t just see filenames; you can jump to the file from the name. The view is transformable. Etc, etc.
 I learned today about running grep from within emacs. I tried it out, and the results were spoiled by the inclusion of files from my mypy folder, which aren&#x27;t of interest. I could modify the grep command to excplude that folder, but I&#x27;m lazy. I&#x27;d prefer to be able to click on the output and say &quot;hide this and anything else from the same folder&quot;.
 I&#x27;d also like to be able to interactively toggle the -h option, to hide the filenames on the left side.
 Is this possible? I see that I can jump to the file, and the line in question, which is great. Other than that, though, the output does not seem to be very interactive.

                              <span>When testing the basic functionality of my actors, my receiveMessage() event on my test probe is timing out, because the probe isn&#x27;t listening for messages on the actor that I&#x27;ve spawned.
 ​
 For some context, I have 2 actors
  
A TaskManager actor
 A Session actor
  
My TaskManager actor has 2 commands:
  
CreateSession(id) - This spawns a new Session actor
 SessionCreated(id, ref) - When a Session actor is spawned, it sends the SessionCreated message back to the TaskManager so that I can store the ref of the session (and perform other stuff)
  
Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m running into the issue. I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.
 Here&#x27;s my test code:
  &quot;Task Manager&quot; must { &quot;be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created&quot; in { val taskManager &#x3D; spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe &#x3D; createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession(&quot;session1&quot;) val reply &#x3D; sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } 
 I&#x27;ve been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won&#x27;t complete the changes that I need to test subsequently. I do know that the taskManager value does have a ref, but it doesn&#x27;t have a receiveMessage method, so I&#x27;m stumped here.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated! Sorry for the noob question :-)

#Zettelkasten-method #cognitive-overload #quick-revision
I am relatively new to Zettelkasten (but have come across it earlier) and have just begun using Zettlr. I was trying to figure out whether for my use case, the method of Zettelkasten (which fascinates me) would be a good idea.
Previous experience suggests it is risky. I got hooked on Org-mode and Spacemacs spending time on setting it up when I had a deadline approaching.

 doom-lighttable-theme
 I created a theme for Doom based on the default Lighttable theme
  
Grab a copy from here
 Copy the theme file to ~/.doom.d/themes/doom-lighttable-theme.el
 Update your ~/.doom.d/config.el with: (setq doom-theme &#x27;doom-lighttable)
 reload.
  
It is still a WIP but I use it every day with no issues. I plan on creating a merge request to the main doom themes repo once I find time. Any feedback would be cool :)

 In short, I&#x27;d like the function to do this: whenever I switch buffers, Emacs runs this function which should take the underlying filename of the buffer, open an org file arranged as a datetree, create a (or go to an already existing) heading based on the filename, and clock in. If that heading is the currently-clocked item, don&#x27;t clock out and in again. Use the top-level directory name of the project as the file tag (for later filtering).
 This seems to work if I&#x27;ve already opened the org file and org-mode has been run. It fails on the first run when opening Emacs (beca…</span>

 Prettify-symbols enabled
 Prettify-symbols disabled
 (prettify-symbols-mode nil) 
 but this didn&#x27;t disable this mode.

 I am using following code to make org- tables collapsible. Works great appart from styling - in hidden state tables occupies 2 lines with 3 dots below:
 #+NAME: mytbl ... 
 How to make dots appear one same line right after table name?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use Debian 11 with KDE. So far, I was on KDE X11 and I ran the emacs daemon as a service (debian configures this for you ootb, so you simply need to enable it).
 However, I moved to a KDE wayland setup today, and I cannot launch the client after boot. I think it is launching before wayland can set things up (I have no idea what that means though...).
 journalctl --user -u emacs.service | tail -n 10 gives me
 Feb 17 15:39:39 xxx emacs[1302]: Loaded /home/x/.emacs.d/config/settings.el Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode... Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done (0.330s, 90 buffers checked) Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Starting Emacs daemon. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: Started Emacs text editor. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx emacs[1302]: Package cl is deprecated Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: emacs.service: Got notification message from PID 3258, but reception only permitted for main PID 1302 Feb 17 15:41:51 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified Feb 17 15:45:53 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified 
 So I am guessing the daemon loads properly and then encounters some problems after the Package cl is deprecated message. If I try to run the client with emacsclient -c I get
 Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Display :1 can’t be opened 
 Which is very strange since systemctl status --user emacs.service shows that the service is indeed active. Any help/suggestions/comments?
 Cheers

When I process all of those numbers, the *Calc Trail* buffer doesn&#x27;t scroll down automatically, so I have to do it to see what my most recent calculations were.
 Demonstration: https://gfycat.com/windingcanineivorybackedwoodswallow 
 For reference, here&#x27;s what I do in the GIF:
  
Input the numbers 1 - 0
 Sum them all
 Scroll the *Calc Trail* buffer, then do M-S-&gt;
 Repeat the same process another time
  
I really enjoy calc-mode, but it&#x27;s frustrating to use for long equations due to this. Anyone have similar issues?

 Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for a new keyboard and I sort of settled on the Moonlander or Planck. Moonlander is a full fledged ergonomic keyboard and Planck is a smaller (40%) keyboard. I will often have the keyboard with me as I&#x27;m working at home and a couple of different locations at work, therefore the small planck is tempting. Anyone that uses Planck with Emacs? Will it be better to buy a larger ergonomic keyboard? 
 Any input will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Ok, due to the latest Arch update of latest gcc &amp; gcc-libs (they package it so), libgccjit was broken. I had to uninstall it so I could upgrade rest of the system, and my Emacs didn&#x27;t start due to missing libgccjit.so. So I quickly recompiled Emacs without native compiler, and surprise. I don&#x27;t even miss native compiler. 
 I used to see a difference in Helm and some other places like a year ago when native comp was in its early stages. I don&#x27;t have benchmarks, but my Emacs seems like even smoother without native comp for some reason. There are no hiccups, no waiting for completions to pop up. What happened? I run current master, re-compiled like 2 days ago.
 I now even wonder if I will enable native comp again. Is it just me, or do other people experience similar?

 Anyone knows how to set eww-mode buffers to auto wrap the long lines?

                              <span>Quick question, I recently started using lsp-mode with ccls as a language server and my buffers are cluttered with a counter for each variable showing how many time it&#x27;s referenced in the code base.
 Is there a way to disable it? they&#x27;re a bit annoying as every time I delete a line they don&#x27;t go away instantly and clutter the buffer for a couple of seconds making it almost unusable.
 Screenshot for reference.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Preamble
  
I&#x27;ve tried google, but I don&#x27;t know/understand emacs terms enough to know what to search. 
 I&#x27;m not asking for a config, or &quot;edit some-variable-name&quot; I want to learn and the best way for me is by doing
 I&#x27;m a prose writer and have converted my markdown novel into org.
 The meat
  
Since I don&#x27;t use text editors for code, I&#x27;d like to have emacs &quot;know&quot; to use helvetica when I open an *.org file. I&#x27;d done something similar in vim where markdown files would word wrap at 100 characters and a few other things I&#x27;ve since forgotten. (I haven&#x27;t written in over a year and it&#x27;s been longer than that since I edited init.vim
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with prelude-emacs … distro? I&#x27;d like to use vanilla emacs but add whatever package pops up a mini-buffer? With hints after chording C-c or M-x
 TLDR
  
What variable should I look at to have org mode use helvetica font? What package gives hints after typing C-c , M-x etc

                              <span>First, Install OpenBangla for your distro following the official guide. (OpenBanlga include avro and many more feature.)
 Next, configure the input method for your Window Manager according to the guide above. After you do that, you can now change input method using s+SPACE So now you can have a workflow.
 - Go to emacs
 - Open a file and type some bangla texts.
 - If you need to type commands, do s+SPACE to move back to English.
 Its fairly obvious but I thought it might be helpful for some beginners who searched for similar feature, like me. And also, its not nearly as seamless as M-x set-input-method bengali-itrans which automatically handles all of these for you and gives you an amazing writing experience. Sadly, it does not yet provide avro-style input-method and the existing itrans,probhat are really unorthodox input method that very few uses and hard to master. I hope someday I will have enough knowledge to contribute that.

                              <span>I know plenty of people come to emacs from Vim, so it makes sense to use evil, spacemacs, etc, but I rarely if ever see the other way around. I&#x27;ve been doing vanilla emacs for a bit, and while I&#x27;m used to it, I definitely don&#x27;t love the navigation shortcuts, and I&#x27;ve always been very interested in how Vim works.
 Anyone here was already used to and comfortable with regular emacs bindings and decided to learn Vim keybindings?
 Did you think it was worth it? Did you keep it or went back to vanilla emacs? Do you use it only in certain contexts? Any tips for how to pursue it?

                              <span>I started using orgmode two months ago after I learnt about it from videos from thoughtbot. Never having used emacs before and not knowing lisp it took me while to ramp up on it. I found the way you can have neatly nested lists and have math equations quite nice. I set up org roam as well . Everything on doom emacs. But after 2 months of using it I find myself in a situation where it has turned out to be not all I expected it to be. * The org roam promise of becoming a second brain didn&#x27;t really work for me. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly but having backlink info in the buffer I didn&#x27;t find that useful. It&#x27;s not easy to find things unless you remember the name or keywords in the title.
  
Writing long documents feels clunky in orgmode. Maybe it&#x27;s more adapted to short todos. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it
 
Export options : I can export to pdf but the output often doesn&#x27;t look good with the weird section numbering. Having nested items looks good inside orgmode but not in an exported pdf. There&#x27;s no option to export to doc that I&#x27;m aware of. It makes collaboration with others difficult
 
It doesn&#x27;t work well with tools my team uses with slack and google docs. 
 
And many others
 
 Has anyone else felt like this? What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;m planning to go back to vs code and mark down files because emacs looks like a big investment. But I really like the idea of a macro enabled editor.
 Edit: I didn&#x27;t expect such useful and positive feedback from everyone. You guys are the best. I found some promising stuff . I&#x27;m going to give it another try. Thanks!

 I am using following code to make org- tables collapsible. Works great appart from styling - in hidden state tables occupies 2 lines with 3 dots below:
 #+NAME: mytbl ... 
 How to make dots appear one same line right after table name?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement a Convolutional Neural Network in Haskell. I have previously built a normal artificial network using hmatrix for linear algebra operations (BLAS, etc.) but now that I need to do convolutions, I have to somehow parallelise my code. I looked into the obvious packages for parallel arrays such as repa arrays and the accelerate package. accelerate is an embedded DSL which I think would make the code quite unelegant and I want to stay as close to Haskell as possible. Further, I am working on a Windows PC with a CUDA capable GPU but also a MacBook Pro 2021 so I&#x27;d have to implement both accelerate and some other package for non-CUDA PCs as well.
 So that brings me to Repa, which seems perfect for my purposes:

 I would much appreciate some help. Haskell is acting really weird with infinite lists and I would like to figure out, what is happening.
 So, I have a type BitString, which is a wrapper around Data.ByteString.Lazy and allows me to construct a bytestring from single bits. It works fine, but I would like to be able to work with infinite bitstrings.
 Here is part of the code relevant to this problem:
 import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Internals as BLI data BitString &#x3D; BitString Word8 Word8 BL.ByteString -- head, size of the head, tail #define EMPTY (BitString 0 0 BLI.Empty) -- for simpler pattern matching empty :: BitString empty &#x3D; EMPTY cons :: Word8 -&gt; BitString -&gt; BitString cons b (BitString h l t) | l &#x3D;&#x3D; 7 &#x3D; BitString 0 0 (push…</span>

                              <span>I was quite excited to discover how to use The Archive in two windows properly. I&quot;m sure many people here know this, but I thought I&#x27;d share it here as it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me at first.
If you open a new window (from the Window menu), it opens a second copy of The Archive. Normally, this window operates independently of the first window.
But what I hadn&#x27;t realized is that, if you have the second window open and highlighted, you can right click on links in the (unhighlighted) first window. If you hover over a link, right click and select Open Link in that window, it leaves the first window on its current page, and opens the link in the second window. Very cool. This is really useful for copying material between documents that are part of the same &quot;tree&quot; of documents, without losing your place or leaving the current document.</span>

                              <span>This feature request might be considered esoteric, but oh well.
MultiMarkdown Composer has a feature called elastic tabstops which allows indented text to be correctly aligned even when using a proportional font:

  
Rather than assigning a fixed number of spaces to a tab character, or a fixed width, tabs represent “columns” of text. Contiguous lines of text are examined to ensure that the columns are wide enough to contain the text in each line.


Why does it matter? My theme uses a monospaced font for all markdown syntax (-, *, &gt;, etc.), but a proportional font for everything else. (I stole this idea from the brillant folks at Cultured Code.) As it right now however, when mixing proportional and monospaced fonts, The Archive doesn&#x27;t align lists correctly.</span>

                              <span>In this final post of the series, we finally get down to business: writing a type-checking plugin.
We concentrate on giving a high-level overview of the process.
For worked examples and the nitty-gritty details, please refer to my new

 The relevant directories exist, some aspects have been changed to protect the identities of those involved :) Any help would be much appreciated. (If parens don&#x27;t match here, it&#x27;s because of bad copy-pasta, not because that&#x27;s how it is in my config -- I&#x27;ve checked for paren-matching in the actual config)

                              <span>I am trying to write a function for a org-capture template that uses on the value of a template expansion. So for example, when reading emails, depending on the %:from value, the string used in the template is different. The only way I found it to work was to do something like this:
  (&quot;mt&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (file+olp &quot;~/org/todos.org&quot; &quot;My todos&quot;) &quot;%(custom/task-email \&quot;%:from\&quot; \&quot;%:subject\&quot;)&quot; :empty-lines 1) 
 Is it possible to use the value %:from within the custom/task-email? I just want to avoid having multiple lines with \&quot;%:from\&quot; \&quot;%:subject\&quot;
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey @all,
 TL;DR: Would appreciate some feedback about my WIP Emacs theme. Link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Last week I finally had the time to do one thing that was on my bucket list for quite some time: Write my own Emacs color theme.
 It is not available on MELPA yet, because I first wanted to ask some fellow Emacs users about their opinion. So far, the one person that also uses Emacs and I know irl thinks it is quite pleasant. But I would appreciate a bit more feedback, so here I am.
 It is still a WIP so every feedback is very welcome (: For now, I only included packages I use on a regular basis, but I&#x27;ll try to slowly but surely add dedicated support for more packages (requests welcome). Most of the other packages I know have sane inheritance and could still be usable right now. I am by far not an elisp-pro but I tried my best to provide a dark and a light version without too much duplicate code.
 If you wanna check it out, here is the link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Thanks &lt;3

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get GNUS to show article fullscreen after select on summary screen. I found out about gnus-buffer-configuration variable where is configuration of how screen should by displayed. I also found gnus-add-configuration function to modify. I tried to set article settings to:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0 point))) 
 But when I try to open article I get gnus-summary-show-thread: Args out of range: 0 and empty buffer is open in fullscreen. I also tried without point:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0))) 
 since I got same error when I tried to reset to default and I forgot to delete points from behind the article:
 (gnus-add-configuration &#x27;(article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point) (article 1.0 point)))) 
 I also tried to get (summary 0) but that was some other error and I thing it also does not make much sense.
 Anybody tried similar thing? How to setup GNUS to open article fullscreen?
 EDIT: I tried to debug gnus a little bit and I find out that responsible function for shoving thread is gnus-summary-show-thread, but can&#x27;t understand what exactly it is doing, from mi point of view I see only some tinkering with cursor position and something called overlays:
 (defun gnus-summary-show-thread () &quot;Show thread subtrees. Returns nil if no thread was there to be shown.&quot; (interactive nil gnus-summary-mode) (let* ((orig (point)) (end (point-at-eol)) (end (or (gnus-summary--inv end) (gnus-summary--inv (1- end)))) ;; Leave point at bol (beg (progn (beginning-of-line) (if (bobp) (point) (1- (point))))) (eoi (and end (next-single-char-property-change end &#x27;invisible)))) (when eoi (remove-overlays beg eoi &#x27;invisible &#x27;gnus-sum) (goto-char orig) (gnus-summary-position-point) eoi)))

                              <span>That&#x27;s a bit of a strange post, but I hope it may spark some positive discussion: Emacs recently get tab support. First AFAIK from Centaur Emacs and then upstream. Tabs are common UI elements since years, however IMVHO in most cases are a very bad idea as they are normally: modern monitor are 16:9 and most people use them straight, not 90° rotated, so plenty of horizontal space, very little vertical one and tabs eat some of it while still being unable to scale well...
 On contrary &quot;experiments&quot; like Tab Center Redux (it&#x27;s successor Tab Center Reborn) Firefox extension show that vertical tabs can scale well, they might be &quot;hard to choose&quot; at first, but actually work pretty well. They remain easy to read even when they are many, they might be scrollable if needed, integrated with switch-buffer search&amp;narrow packages, they might co-exist with a sidebar (like those popular in IDEs), even on one and another side of the screen and potentially spark new UI ideas to extend them further. 
 What do you think about that?

 ​
 Emacs and Preview displaying the same PDF, where it is much darker in Emacs
 I am not sure why this happens -- I haven&#x27;t changed any settings related to DocView or enabled any minor modes that would cause this. Disabling my current emacs config (by moving .emacs.d) does not resolve this. I am using the mituharu emacs-mac port from this Homebrew formula, but the issue also exists with the build from https://emacsformacosx.com. My .emacs.d is on GitHub here.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue before? How would I go about resolving this?
 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue is caused by GhostScript, as expressed in this comment. I&#x27;ve resolved it by installing mupdf (brew install mupdf), which should cause docview to use mudraw to convert PDFs to temporary PNGs instead of GhostScript. After installing mupdf, opening a PDF in DocView and running doc-view-clear-cache should resolve the issue.

                              <span>I hope one of you fine folk can help. I&#x27;m trying to set up mu4e and integrate it with my org-mode based GTD system.
 I already have org capture templates set up to make next action entries.
 What I want to do now, is make the next action entry have a link to the email that the action is about (i.e. the one I was reading when I invoked the capture template)... but if I invoke the capture template from someplace other than an email, I don&#x27;t want there to be a link in it.
 So if I&#x27;m in an email, I want C-c c a w to open this template:
 (&quot;aw&quot; &quot;Work Related&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/mygtd.org&quot; &quot;Work&quot;) &quot;* TODO %? %a %u \n\n &quot;) 
 But if I&#x27;m someplace other than an email, I want the same key combination C-c c a w to open this template:
 (&quot;aw&quot; &quot;Work Related&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/mygtd.org&quot; &quot;Work&quot;) &quot;* TODO %? %u \n\n &quot;) 
 Which is exactly the same, except it has no %a in it.
 How would I do that?

                              <span>Hi all,
 seems I am too stupid to customize modes for my text file editing, either via manually changing the .emacs or via M-x customize or via Easy Customize menu. Have read all online doc, internet search, &quot;Learning GNU Emacs&quot; book. Have tested dozens of variants given in these sources for manual changes in .emacs, but regardless which variant, when I open my file, none is active and shown in mode line. Only I managed to set fill-column via Easy Customize dialog ad the adwaita look.
 I simply want to have text-mode, enriched-mode, auto-fill-mode, flyspell-mode set as standard for working buffer. 
 Here is my latest .emacs: 
 (custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook t)
 &#x27;(ansi-color-faces-vector
 [default default default italic underline success warning error])
 &#x27;(ansi-color-names-vector
 [&quot;black&quot; &quot;red3&quot; &quot;ForestGreen&quot; &quot;yellow3&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;magenta3&quot; &quot;DeepSkyBlue&quot; &quot;gray50&quot;])
 &#x27;(custom-enabled-themes &#x27;(adwaita))
 &#x27;(display-fill-column-indicator t)
 &#x27;(fill-column 75)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;auto-fill-mode)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;enriched-mode)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;flyspell-mode))
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 ) 
 If anyone could advise, I would be happy!

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble customizing emacs.
 I have learned how to use hooks to switch things on and off, e.g.:
  (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;visual-line-mode) 
 So that text files will open with word wrap on.
 What I&#x27;ve not been able to do is to pass a value in on starting a mode, e.g.:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; doesn&#x27;t work
 (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;text-scale-adjust 3))
 or
 (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;text-scale-adjust &amp;eval (&#x27;text-scale-adjust 3))
 doesn&#x27;t work
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m sure you can see what I&#x27;m trying to do -- when in text mode, automatically enlarge the text so that I can read it.
 I have read the manual -- but unfortunately that part of the manual (23.1.1 Running Hooks) doesn&#x27;t give any examples.
 I think the bit that reads: &quot;If a hook variable has a non-nil value, that value should be a list of functions. run-hooks calls all the functions, one by one, with no arguments.&quot; refers to what I&#x27;m trying to do, but how I write a list of functions that evaluates to &quot;3&quot; I&#x27;ve no idea.
 Any help appreciated.

 but the issue inside &#x60;mc/execute-this-command-for-all-cursors-1&#x60; hasn&#x27;t stood out to me yet..i&#x27;m on a very recent version &#x60;20211112.2223&#x60; which seems to be as of the lastest commit to its repo

                              <span>Just curious for a quick n dirty read, so sorry if I missed your favorite distro or bundled yours with one you dislike; I&#x27;m no linux guru, I&#x27;m in the middle of a distro hopping soul searching journey right now.
 Lemme know how good your OS is at integrating with emacs, bonus points if you suggest a window manager too.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m sorry that people are upset with me for the way I&#x27;ve set up the poll, I am close to a total newcomer to Linux, and I&#x27;ve just seen these groupings of distros around (usually referring to difficulty/level of customization) so I figured it was a fine enough compromise since I couldn&#x27;t add them all as poll options. As for why I didn&#x27;t include various distros like BSDs, as some commenters guessed, I just had never heard of them before.
 Also sorry that it&#x27;s single choice, it slipped my mind and I can&#x27;t change it now

If not would wrapping stuff in calls to elpy be the best option or should I just write the python commands I want to use as individual scripts then call them through the shell command functions? In case it&#x27;s relevant the library is https://pypi.org/project/FlightRadarAPI/

I&#x27;d like to bind evil-mode&#x27;s &quot;K&quot; key (originally &quot;evil-lookup&quot;) to be &quot;lsp-ui-doc-glance&quot; whenever I am in a lsp-ui-mode enabled buffer. My idea is to run a condition check whenever I&#x27;m entering a new buffer, with the buffer-list-update-hook. My code snippet below seems to be working (having tested thoroughly though), but I wonder if there is a more elegant way to achieve this:
 (add-hook &#x27;buffer-list-update-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (when (bound-and-true-p lsp-ui-mode) (define-key evil-motion-state-local-map (kbd &quot;K&quot;) #&#x27;lsp-ui-doc-glance))))

                              <span>Hi to everyone! I&#x27;m an undergraduate Mathematics student with also a great interest in Computer Science. In order to complete my degree, I have to write and discuss a small thesis (roughly 40 to 60 pages long) about a topic of my interest. I&#x27;d like to talk about an overview of the use of Category Theory in Functional Programming, therefore I stumbled upon Haskell and the book &quot;Category Theory for Programmars&quot;. Since there is a lot of material to know about, I&#x27;d kindly ask you, if possible, what you think are the most fundamental or important topics which are worth covering in such a small format. Thanks!

 (Edit: I understand that the following is not a valid solution) I was looking at GHC.Ptr but I have not seen a way to a -&gt; Ptr a and it seems to not be intended for native types.
 Is there a way to check if two variables reference the same data (not checking for equality of the data)?

 I&#x27;m trying to get flyspell to play nice with electric-quote-mode. Basically, especially in org-mode, I want to be able to use &#x27;smart&#x27; quotes without each instance of e.g. isn’t being marked as a spelling error.
 Aspell only seems to like straight quotes
 I&#x27;ve looked around the customization options for flyspell but haven&#x27;t found anything that looks relevant. And it occurred to me that I cannot be the only person dealing with this problem. So I come here asking for help. Anyone?
 (I found a post by Artur Malabarba offering a solution to this problem but I&#x27;m wondering if others have other fixes.)

 Fountain was originally made for Screenplays, but I&#x27;d love to be able to type something like 
 FX:
 And then have the following words underscored and in all caps until a manual line-break.
 Does anybopdy know how I can write that function into the mode? Is there an elisp-way to do it?

package-refresh-contents
 package-install  lsp-mode -- this fails.
  
package-compute-transaction: Package ‘spinner-1.7.3’ is unavailable
 package-archives is a variable defined in ‘package.el’. Its value is ((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)) 
 I&#x27;ve confirmed that both lsp-mode and lsp-pyright exist on Melpa unstable. Package-refresh-contents works fine. I just keep getting the same message about spinner-1.7.3 not being available. I can&#x27;t even think how I would debug this further. :(

                              <span>So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.
 I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. 
 However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won&#x27;t export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn&#x27;t understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.
 After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. 
 So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn&#x27;t find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have slowly transitioned from PyCharm to Emacs for my coding development and It&#x27;s been about 6 months now and in general am very happy with my workflow in Emacs. There is just one thing that is still pulling me back to PyCharm and it is something that others might not find too useful but I constantly use. 
 It is the tree-like structure overview for your code that PyCharm has that you can toggle on the left and it looks like this. 
 Now I know I can get a directory overview with the treemacs package and I also know about the iMenu command which is very nice but not exactly a static tree-like structure you can look at. I was wondering if there exists a package to show the class/functions/ structure of a file on the side as you can see on the picture above. 
 Thank you for your help.

 ​
 Example with two entries having a #Bib tag.
 I am not sure which component is responsible for such search results. Is it ivy, ivy-rich or counsel. I am using all of them in my init.el.
 After an update of all packages via M-x list-packages + U + x the tag column is gone. In which package should I look into to find the correct setting/variable or open a ticket for it.

                              <span>Consult-project defines an endpoint for accessing different sources related to the common project workflow. Using Consult&#x27;s narrowing system, the user is able to access the current project&#x27;s buffers, project files and all the known projects, in case they want to change projects quickly. Consult-project provides an extension to the default Consult functionality, using the built-in package project.el, defining the functions consult-project and consult-project-other-window. Furthermore, Consult-project only depends on consult, resulting in a lean and simple to maintain functionality.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package consult-projectile by OlMon. Most if not all credit should go to him, I have been using his package for months now. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Daniel Mendler for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I&#x27;ll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 I have been trying to set up a vscode like debug experience and I feel like I am close but not there yet. 
 I want to be able to debug JS, TS, C/C++, Rust and Go.
 This is my config https://github.com/andrerogers/dotfiles/blob/master/.cfg/emacs/emacs.el
 Any help in modifying this to ensure I&#x27;m using lsp and dap correctly for the above languages, and to the best of its current ability, would be much appreciated.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Does anyone know how to auto generate variable type for Rust in emacs. 
 For example, when you type out the variable 
 let msg &#x3D; &quot;something&quot;; 
 it will auto populate
 let msg: &amp;str &#x3D; &quot;something&quot;; 
 Similar to the way that VS code does it.

                              <span>I want to write:
 class PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow :: a -&gt; String instance Pretty a &#x3D;&gt; PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow &#x3D; show . pretty instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow a &#x3D; show 
 Now the behavior I want is: if my type is known (at compile-time) to be Show, then use show, but if I know Pretty, then use pretty OVER the show instance (subsequent instances might take further precedence, but I don&#x27;t need more instances to be possible). The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).
 But I know why I can&#x27;t write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don&#x27;t care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...
 Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like. Use reflection if you must but bonus points if its raw GHC Haskell: we will all bask in the ugliness.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in Google summer of code event but missed it last year. I want to attend the event this year and notice that Haskell.org was one of the organizations. It sounds really exciting, I hope Haskell.org will participate in GSoC this year as well. But I have little experience with Haskell, I&#x27;m worried about how to write an expressive proposal when I don&#x27;t even know which projects they will focus on. Can anyone give me so resources or suggestions about the following question?
  
How can I predict the projects this year? (Where can I find out some clues?)
 Which materials should I go through to master required basic skills, including reading books, articles (both blogs and papers), open-source project code, and any other resource? I can only finish some 1-3 kyu problems on CodeWars now. (My CodeWars Profile)
 How to write an attractive proposal in GSoC for working with Haskell.org? I can find very few accepted GSoC proposals on the Internet, many of which were even written several years ago. I have almost no idea about how to write the proposal, especially for Haskell.org, can you provide me with some examples for references?
  
Thanks a lot.

 I have two questions, and both of them are about this commit: https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/tree/59277e41bd12b6f390600c78f12742f5da335aea.
 Static binary
 Currently I&#x27;m not really aware of exactly what libs I need to build a static binary with cabal build; locally in nix develop. 
  
Output
 Packages in flake.nix
 swoogle&#x27;s ghc-options in swapi.cabal
  
It does work fine in the CI (I think) since I&#x27;m using the ghc-musl image, but I&#x27;m not sure how that translates to a Nix environment, unfortunately. Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the ghc-options under the swoogle executable), but I&#x27;d like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. 
 Discrepancies in CI and dev
  
Dockerfile
 GitHub Actions file
 cabal.project.freeze
 swapi.cabal
  
This has more to do with how cabal resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: (GitHub Actions, PasteBin).
 My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does cabal resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about req, and some other libraries. I think I&#x27;m missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments. I don&#x27;t understand where it pulled that new base version from.
 I&#x27;ll try to provide more information if ever what I&#x27;ve provided so far is insufficient. Thanks.

                              <span>Ok, I&#x27;ve been learning akka, and I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let&#x27;s recap
 JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.
 Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.
 AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.
 The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.
 The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can&#x27;t touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn&#x27;t there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?
 CONCLUSION
 I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I tried to export it with C-c C-e m m:
 # Table of Contents 1. [Test](#org358707a)  # Test ![img](./img/test.jpg &quot;test&quot;) 
 Which is almost perfect but the #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px wasn&#x27;t exported.
 I then tried with pandoc C-c C-e p g (and in CLI with pandoc -i reddit.org -o reddit.md):
 @:t ::t |:t ^:{} \_:{} \*:t TeX:t LaTeX:t # Test ![](./img/test.jpg) 
 Looks like pandoc doesn&#x27;t care about my options and even wrote some of them as plain text and the size for my image is still not here.
 Is there a way to achieve it (other than writing 
 #+html:  
 Because I tried:
 * Test #+CAPTION: test #+NAME: fig:test #+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export #+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400xp [[./img/test.jpg]] #+html:  
 But the image is still exported.
 And why does pandoc export my options as plain text?

Org-journal seems like what I want/need, but the formatting is just weird. Perhaps I&#x27;m trying to use it in a way that&#x27;s not intended. Below is an example:
 * Tuesday, 02/15/2022
 ** 09:20 Is this supposed to be a header? I&#x27;d rather be notes here instead of having a header.
 This is the start of the next paragraph. I think it would look better if it started such that all text lines up, so &quot;This&quot; would start under the previous paragraphs &quot;Is&quot;.

 EDIT/NOTES: this is not about making a file read-only or about making backups or versioning. It is about the actual process of a human CONFIRMING himself that it wants to change stuff.

                              <span>Hi all!
I&#x27;m new to zettelkasten. I&#x27;ve been playing with it for just a few days now, and I&#x27;ve already found some of the KMs very helpful.
Thanks, @Will, for many of them!
I was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.
For me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I&#x27;ve used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.
I was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:
I place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.
I enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.
It then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).
I select the appropriate structure note.
It automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.
Is this possible? Is it unnecessary?
The reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.
Or, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?</span>

 SimpleX Chat for terminal is built in Haskell, and with a lot of help from u/angerman - thank you! - we made the same core work both on iOS and Android platforms.
 To exchange messages privately you can connect either via the invitation link you can share from the app or by scanning QR code from the app on their phone (e.g., during video call or in person).
 More information about SimpleX and iOS app is in this post: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/blog/20220214-simplex-chat-ios-public-beta.md
 We really look forward to your feedback – you can connect to the team from the app settings (it will be myself or somebody else replying to you:)
 Please star the repo on GitHub (thanks a lot if you did already!) and share iOS app beta with your friends – Android app is coming in a few weeks too!

                              <span>I had to write a rather big university assignment in Haskell a year ago where a particular pattern emerged in the code. There were multiple situations where we had function call chains that looked like this:
 foo -&gt; bar -&gt; baz -&gt; foo -&gt; bar -&gt; baz etc. etc.
 Baz had some conditional behavior in it that either quit the &quot;loop&quot; or returned back to foo again. In the case of the assignment the data being passed around was data for the solution to a puzzle.
 The code worked, but the more I think about it the sketchier it seems.
 Does this seem appropriate or should it be avoided?

                              <span>It seems like the visibility property on a parent heading overrides the visibility property on a child heading - is this expected? e.g. when I have the raw text:
 * Foo :PROPERTIES: :VISIBILITY: content :END: ** Bar :PROPERTIES: :VISIBILITY: folded :END: *** Baz 
 ... I would expect (and would like) to see
 * Foo... * Bar... 
 e.g. where Foo shows only the content below it, and Bar has all of its children folded. Instead, I get
 * Foo... * Bar... * Baz... 
 e.g., behavior like if Foo and Bar both &quot;had their visibility&quot; set to &quot;content&quot; (I&#x27;m aware that&#x27;s not how the internals work but I&#x27;m not sure how else to articulate what I mean). Is there a way to prevent this and get the behavior I&#x27;d expect?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a little package to integrate tab-bar, project.el, and buffer-isolation. This seems to be a thing lots of people want so I thought I&#x27;d share it here. I&#x27;m not a programmer, so this code is almost certainly worse than it could be (though I&#x27;ve been helped by looking at lots of other people&#x27;s code). It works for my use-case and I&#x27;ve done some basic unit-testing, but am happy to hear of things that need fixing.
 https://github.com/mclear-tools/emacs-workspaces
 Note that this doesn&#x27;t affect one&#x27;s tab-bar, tab-line, or project.el config in any way. It just adds a few convenience functions to set things up for isolated buffers and for creating or opening workspaces.

                              <span>Apparently there is a package called python. It&#x27;s built-in, and also distributed through GNU ELPA: https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/python.html
 And there is different one called python-mode in MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/python-mode, with upstream at https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode/
 What is the difference between them?
 The background of my question is that I tried to setup my Emacs 27 as a python environment with a language server like David Wilson (aka SystemCrafter) described in his tutorial. This is a codesnippet of it.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-l&quot;) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) )
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am not sure but it looks like that the python-mode here cause the use of the MELPA version of python-mode. How can I setup the inbuild python mode of Emacs include the use of the language server?

 EmacsWiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowmMode
 I was looking for alternatives to org-mode, not because there is anything wrong with it, but because I use it only for note taking and sometimes TODO and was wondering what else is there.
 Another thing with org is that sometimes the ecosystem, for someone not doing GTD or writing a paper etc. can feel a bit overwhelming. 
 I didn&#x27;t find a lot of info about howm, except a couple posts here, including a 15 year old link that is dead (thank heavens to the Wayback Machine). But I can infer there are some active users between this subreddit and the Emacs Wiki.
 I like the way it links info with &gt;&gt;&gt; and the schedules with special sorting for TODO vs deadline vs reminder seems interesting.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am a new convert to emacs. I tried in the past to get my head around it for simple plain text editing, but it never really clicked. Recently I got back into it (mainly via vim -&gt; evilmode) and I am currently hacking away on my own config. (The stream series &quot;Emacs from Scratch&quot; by System Crafters was insanely helpful.)
 I am a physics postgrad and use R for data analysis and yihui&#x27;s suite of R packages for any type of write-up/publishing.
  
RMarkdown: Simple Markdown syntax to write documents with R code blocks mainly to avoid writing LaTeX directly and for reproducibility.
 bookdown: Write scientific reports in RMarkdown and export them to html (Github Pages) and pdf with references and citations.
 blogdown: Publish my personal website via a simple RMarkdown syntax and easy to use R-functions. (Not thaaaat important to me, I don&#x27;t blog regularly)
  
I have realised that I can do most of those things also using orgmode. Is someone here who made a similar switch from the RMarkdown ecosystem to orgmode, who could point me in the right direction regarding workflows, packages or tutorials etc? I am slowly getting paralysed by the amount of possibilities I have with emacs and now orgmode....
 ​
 edit: I mainly want to switch to emacs with orgmode to get away from RStudio. I feel it can be quite limiting.

                              <span>I switched from PhpStorm to Emacs for my Php editing and it feels amazing, I feel much more comfortable and productive using all my familiar keybindings, tools and modes.
 I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with intelephense as the back-end. Code completion works great, but I&#x27;m missing the usual alerts that I got with PhpStorm which showed, in the method signature, which exceptions where thrown but not catched.
 What do you guys use for that? Should I use another specific tool for it or maybe should I switch to another LSP back-end, ...?
 Thanks a lot in advance!
 EDIT: as a front-end for linting, I&#x27;m using the built-in flymake-mode.

 I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to make it so that when I C-c in a src block in org-mode, it first checks all related src blocks in the file, tangle them together in a temporary buffer and only then execute the buffer, providing the results needed.
 Is there a native way to do that? Am I supposed to use the post-tangle hook org-babel provides?
 For now what I&#x27;m doing is:
 - create all src blocks setting the tangle to a file location I can access, like #+begin_src typescript :tangle ~/tmp/this-is-a-test.ts
 - run org-babel-tangle
 - running the compiler on that file manually to find out the results
 However, that is tedious and I want to figure out a way to …</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m trying to get my head around sbt, I have a little issue now to read files from src/main/resources.
 If I build the jar with sbt package the resource is in the jar, if I run the class I can read the file with getResourceAsStream, but not when doing sbt run.
 How do I make them part of the classpath of sbt run? 
 Example code:
 ----- build.sbt ----- mainClass :&#x3D; Some(&quot;App&quot;) ----- src/main/resources/file.txt ----- content ----- src/main/scala/App.scala ----- object App { def main(args : Array[String]) { println(classOf[App].getResourceAsStream(&quot;/file.txt&quot;)) } } ----- output of sbt run ----- [... omissis ...] null ----- output of scala -classpath target/scala-2.12/test_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar App ----- sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection$JarURLInputStream@453da22c

                              <span>Hi,
I&#x27;m working on some notes and I&#x27;m a bit confused on the process I should use.
I have note which is about &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; where I talk about the differences between the two.
It comes from the Zettelkasten method, and it gave me ideas on many other subjects, like therapy, coaching and marketing.
I also already have a note that says &quot;It&#x27;s not about what you know, it&#x27;s about what you do with what you know&quot;, talking about the ideas that knowledge is not enough, and that it&#x27;s acting on knowledge that builds and create things. That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.
I had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.
At first, I was writing everything in the first note &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The &quot;flow&quot; got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.
I&#x27;m new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.
So I splited my &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; note into 5 different notes.
I now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.
In a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.
It&#x27;s a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; and let that note because a bit longer and like an &quot;index&quot; of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.
And when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not &quot;that short&quot; and even sometimes, not that atomic.
What&#x27;s the best method here in your opinion ? What&#x27;s your take on this ?
Thanks a lot</span>

Wondering whether anyone has written something to render an arbitrary keymap in a transient menu? Of course transient menu items need names, but you could just use the symbol names.

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">

                              <span>So I have a chunk of hexadecimal digits in a buffer, I want to convert it to raw bytes. I happen to know the raw bytes are going to all be ASCII characters.
 Here is the solution I have so far:
 I start with this:
 74686520717569636b2062726f776e20 666f78206a756d706564206f76657220 746865206c617a7920646f67 
 I run this on the buffer
 (let ((case-replace nil)) (replace-regexp &quot;[[:xdigit:]]\\{2\\}&quot; &quot;\\\\x\\&amp;&quot;) (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp &quot;^&quot; &quot;(insert \&quot;&quot;) (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp &quot;$&quot; &quot;\&quot;)&quot;)) 
 That makes the buffer into this:
 &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20&quot; &quot;\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20&quot; &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67&quot; 
 Now I make it into a Lisp expression:
 (goto-char (point-min)) (insert &quot;(insert\n&quot;) (goto-char (point-max)) (insert &quot;)&quot;) 
 Now my buffer has this:
 (insert &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20&quot; &quot;\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20&quot; &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67&quot;) 
 Finally I do this:
 (eval (read (prog1 (buffer-string) (erase-buffer)))) 
 and I get the result I want
 the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog 
 Is there a better way to do this? It would especially be nice to do this without (eval (read (buffer-string))). Note that this function needs to run on arbitrary length string inputs scattered throughout a buffer, but mostly operate on only 2-8 bytes of hexadecimal encoded data at a time, so something that works efficiently on small strings is best.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have been using emacs and writing simple functions for a while, I had also tried to make minor modes previously, and have made things that were super useful to me, but those were so niche that I didn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s be useful. But this time I made something that I think might be useful to others so I&#x27;m sharing it here.
 This is a minor mode that can do well with LaTeX or org-mode. 
 What it does is: convert valid lisp expressions to LaTeX expressions. As you know we can evaluate lisp expressions directly in emacs (C-x C-e), so I had this thought why not use emacs as a calculator while typing the text without the need to move to another buffer to calculate things. But the problem was I couldn&#x27;t leave the lisp expressions as it is if I have to submit the paper somewhere. S…</span>

 As in the title; I want to use uuid&#x27;s for links to other parts of my files, but they won&#x27;t all be on the same system. Essentially, between all my projects, all in different git repositories, I want to link to different parts of their documentation, and was wondering how uuid links would translate to html duing org-html-export-to-html.
 Thank you kindly for the information!

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (cl-position 2 &#x27;(2 6 7)) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : 0 
 I think the results section take up too much, and I would like to make this more compact with something like:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (cl-position 2 &#x27;(2 6 7)) #+end_src &#x3D;&gt; 0 
 I have a couple of questions regarding this change:
  
How would I go about making this work? I am pretty new to directly touching the Emacs packages themselves, so not sure how this would look.
 Are there any drawbacks to this approach that I might not have considered?
  
Thanks.

                              <span>HI, I cannot find on the internet ways to be faster on using org mode to move items between files, I am doing some hacks but I know that there have to be a faster way, to optimize such a repetitive task.
 Intuitively I opened two vertical windows, so that i have in window 1 a file A.org in a buffer, and in window 2 a file B.org in antoher buffer
 What i cut in a file is not pasted as I would expect in the second bufffer:
 1) Selecting ONE heading with relative subheadings, or selecting subheading in windows 1 cutting and pasting in window 2 at a different level of nested level, is painful, because the two files have different level of indentation(I mean number of asterisks). So for example if I have in window 1 a block of text that is at a third level, when I am going to paste in window 2 &#x60;at a specific point&#x60; at a 5th level, is &#x60;not&#x60; going to be recognized that need to be pasted &quot;under&quot; the 5th level and so be recognized as a 6th level the heading(from window 1) and at a 7th level the relative subheading. 
 I would rather select multiple files in window 1 and paste in window 2:
 2) I would like to select multiple headings, or subheadings in window 1 an then just paste them in window 2, so far I have been able only to do it one per time, instead I was expecting to cut in window 1 all the text I needed and then paste all in window2 (I mean like when I am using a resource browser on a PC and I select with control click all the items i need(not consequential) and then paste on a certain point in window 2

                              <span>I’ve recently been assigned an project where I’ve been tasked to create a lexical analyzer with the basis of the main function:
 tokenize :: String -&gt; [(String, Token)]
 and as an arithmetic string as it’s only parameter and without any imported functions (like split)
 I’ve been struggling for the past couple days trying to understand Haskell but having no such luck other than recursion as well as a bit of the split function I made, which I know is used in this project. 
 The output would be something like something like this:
 Input: “(Result * 50) &#x3D; Answer”
 Output: [(“(“, LeftPar),(“Result”, Id),(“*”, Value 50),(“)”, RightPar),(“&#x3D;“, Equals),(“Answer”, Id)]
 I still want to learn so I don’t want the straight full answer, but rather a push in the right direction. Especially when it comes to data type declaration which I know comes into to play here. Any help would be appreciated at this point. Please and thank you.

                              <span>I want to print a string within a do block but Haskell says this is an error. 
 I have the following function:
 getC :: CodeDe -&gt; GenS
 getC c &#x3D; do
 t  GenS
 getC c &#x3D; do
 t &lt;- cType c
 putStrLn (Name c)
 .....
 return $ fmap....
 ​
 I have also tried this in other do blocks. I am confused as this would work in imperative languages. Why can I not print/do something in a do block that is unrelated to the final return?

So far, I&#x27;m loving Scala - seems like a really powerful language and I&#x27;m glad that I have the time to learn it.
 However, I&#x27;ve made a simple test in each language to truly compare the speed of each language when running a large loop, and I&#x27;m finding that JavaScript is actually much faster than Scala in that regard.
 Here&#x27;s a sample of the method I wrote in Scala for the test:
  def runLargeLoop(success: (Int, Long) &#x3D;&gt; Unit, failure: (Throwable) &#x3D;&gt; Unit) &#x3D; { val startTime &#x3D; currentTime val loop &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; Future { var num &#x3D; 0 …</span>

                              <span>Howdy. So I have worked with Scala before but quite a few years ago. It was my big introduction to functional programming and by the end of the project I understood functional programming just well enough to be interested in it. Since then I have studied it extensively in languages that are not purely functional, mainly TypeScript, and this has motivated me to pick up Scala again.
 I know that Scala 3 has just come out. Obviously I would like to work with the latest version. However my experience with other major software updates leaves me a bit wary. I have seen in other ecosystems major updates causing widespread compatibility issues with common libraries resulting in a highly complicated process of figuring out what will and will not work with the new version.
 On that note, I&#x27;m hoping for clarity on a few points:
 1) does scala 2 code compile in a scala 3 project?
 2) will third party libraries written for scala 2 still be compatible with Scala 3? I&#x27;m inclined to say yes because it all compiles to Java bytecode but I just want to be sure.
 3) any other pitfalls that someone with limited scala experience who will be starting with Scala 3 should know?
 Thanks in advance.

 I&#x27;m wondering for a friend if anybody knows of a great ergonomic keyboard while using emacs, particularly for fast entry for enter, ctrl, and backspace. Thank you and best wishes.

                              <span>Basically, similar question to https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/it9vw3/centaurtabs_and_perspmode/
 I just want to be able to have tabs that I can reorganize amongst themselves (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do that with native emacs tabs), and workgroups (e.g: perspective/workgroups/persp-mode/...) to be able to switch from a set of tabs to another set of tabs.
 Currently I have centaur-tabs setup because it&#x27;s the only tab solution that allows me to move tabs (eg: centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-left, centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-right), but it doesn&#x27;t play nice with any workgroup packages. Tabs stay visible in all workgroups with perspective
 Has anyone been able to achieve this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a very new newbie. The pdf (https://orgmode.org/orgguide.pdf) already explained tab cycling in two sections back, &quot;2.2 Visibility Cycling&quot;, and I understand that. But then under &quot;2.4 Structure Editing&quot; they indicate this key binding:
  
&quot;TAB in new empty entry: In a new entry with no text yet, TAB cycles through reasonable levels.&quot; 
  
Is that different than the normal tab cycling? I can&#x27;t find that TAB does anything different anywhere, other than normal cycling to me, but maybe I don&#x27;t understand the context (&quot;in a new entry with no text&quot;) or my org file is still too simple to demonstrate this function?

 I&#x27;ve been working through &quot;Haskell Programing from First Principles&quot; for the last few months. I&#x27;m about half way through the book and I Just finished my first real program. I just wanted to say thank you to the community for being so helpful and maybe get some feedback on my code. I&#x27;m sure I could clean up a lot of things.

                              <span>I understand this might be an odd question, I am just trying to research the idea that if a blockchain (e.g Cardano) uses Haskell in building its Dapps, would the Haskell community, language syntax and its libraries allow an average joe programmer to build blockchain Dapps easily and in a short time ? So my question is since I have used Laravel framework before, does Haskell have some tools/frameworks for start ups that abstracts the background work into easy to do steps to set up for example authentication, Database, etc.

                              <span>In several projects, I&#x27;ve needed a way to implement remote procedure calls. What do people use for this, or is this something that&#x27;s mostly missing in the community? Hackage has a variety of libraries but they&#x27;re either very old or seemingly unmaintained. The only one I see that&#x27;s maintained is grpc-haskell.
 Anyway, grpc-haskell uses proto3-wire instead of proto-lens (which the community seems to have settled on as the best solution). This leads to its own confusion.
 I could use something like warp + servant (or warp + wai to reinvent the wheel), but servant is missing some major functionality for this purpose. Namely, servant is focused on REST, which means the transfer of an entire object state. One of the things I want from an RPC system is the ability to stream data in a type-safe manner (like gRPC does). 
 Any thoughts? I&#x27;d prefer something standardized.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at McBride, Faking It: Simulating Dependent Types in Haskell (2002, doi: 10.1017/S0956796802004355.
 McBride gives us a way to write a variadic zipWith, which (modulo irrelevant details) we can write as
 {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies, FlexibleInstances, UndecidableInstances #-} data Z &#x3D; Z data S n &#x3D; S n nat0 &#x3D; Z :: Z nat1 &#x3D; S nat0 :: S Z nat2 &#x3D; S nat1 :: S (S Z) class ZipWith n fst rest | n fst -&gt; rest where manyApp :: n -&gt; [fst] -&gt; rest instance ZipWith Z t [t] where manyApp Z fs &#x3D; fs instance ZipWith n fst rest &#x3D;&gt; ZipWith (S n) (t -&gt; fst) ([t] -&gt; rest) where manyApp (S n) fs xs &#x3D; manyApp n (zipWith ($) fs xs) nZipWith :: ZipWith n fst rest &#x3D;&gt; n -&gt; fst -&gt; rest nZipWith n f &#x3D; manyApp n (repeat f) 
 then we can call this with nZipWith nat2 (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6].

                              <span>Can we have a deep fmap for a deep multi-layer functor?
 for example:
 deepFamp :: (a-&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe [a] -&gt; Maybe [b] deepFmap &#x3D; (fmap . fmap) 
 This is a map for a two layers Functor.
 Can we have a deepFmap for unknown number of layers Functor?
 for example we have a nested list with many unknown number of dimensions.
 -- each dot represent layers of functor nested inside. deepFmap :: (a-&gt;b) -&gt; [[...[[a]]]..]] -&gt; [[..[[b]]..]] --or When each layer is different from upper or lower layer. deepFmap :: (a-&gt;b) -&gt; MayBe [[..(Maybe...[[a]]...)..]]

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to write an implementation of the tabu search algorithm. Basically local search with a tabu list of recently visited states.
 To do this I need to mess around with parts of Haskell I have never touched before. Type classes.
 I want to generalise the algorithm to the point that the data that the algorithm operates on is completely invisible to the algorithm itself. Like a java interface I want something I can attach to an object type and say &quot;this object is now compatible with this search algorithm&quot;.
 class TabuSt a where evaluate:: a -&gt; Int type ST &#x3D; (Int, [Int]) instance TabuSt ST where evaluate x &#x3D; 0 
 That&#x27;s a toy implementation. I define the type class TabuSt. I define a type alias ST. And I define the instance of the type class. I also define a function evaluate that takes a state and returns an integer evaluation of the state. Note that it does not compile.
 This is the error message &quot;tabu.hs:12:10: error: • Illegal instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’ (All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn) where T is not a synonym. Use TypeSynonymInstances if you want to disable this.) • In the instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’&quot;
 Why does this not work?

                              <span>2022-02-12  I haven&#x27;t touched Booker&#x27;s current book Seven Basic Plots for a few weeks because I wanted to concentrate fully on the second edition of the notebook method. Today, I sat down to the book again. In doing so, it took me about 2h to get back into the subject matter enough to reach my usual level of productivity.
 That&#x27;s two hours I didn&#x27;t work at &quot;optimal operating temperature&quot;.
 The reason it took me so long is related to the depth of the material. But there are additional requirements beyond the book. I have to orient myself in the appropriate section of the notebook and load peripheral knowledge into my working memory. Also, I&#x27;ve been working in a completely different mode for a few weeks: Seven Basic Plots is a blend of science, psychology, and spirituality. The subject of the slip box, on the other hand, is merely factual and aimed primarily at immediate use.
 In some distant future, I would like to conduct an empirical study on this issue. (Do you know some empirical knowledge?)</span>

                              <span>I currently use doom emacs. I&#x27;ve been searching for hours but can&#x27;t figure out a way to do this. 
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to write that 
  
automatically adds paragraph indents to new lines when I press Enter but doesn&#x27;t indent the entire text block (like in Scrivener, word, etc.)
 Formats it nicely like a fiction novel when I export it to pdf
  
I would like it to look like Composition mode in Scrivener or in Manuskript (I tried Manuskript but found it very slow, so I moved over to Emacs). I&#x27;ve tried almost every built-in paragraph/indent mode, Olivetti, and Writeroom Mode, but none of them seem to work.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m new here and to emacs, so sorry if I&#x27;m asking a repeated question or something just not acceptable for some reason.
 I&#x27;ve used vim for many years and then neovim for about two years. I am/was very happy with neovim&#x27;s current state of plugins, ecosystem, lua configuration and vi&#x27;s philosophy on editing text.
 However I&#x27;ve reached a point where I 
 A) have become very interested in lisp languages and
 B) realized that I would like a much more flexible and complete computing environment that goes beyond my text editor. 
 Funnily enough this problem was solved many years ago by the dark side (just a joke 🤣). So I&#x27;m pretty excited to dive into Emacs, learn all about it and I know today its exactly the tool Id like for the rest of my computing career.
 I wanted to ask however to other emacs users, especially ex-Vimmers if readily slapping evil on emacs to make myself comfortable (at least on the text editing side) can hinder me from learning all the ins and outs of emacs?
 I have grown very accustomed to vim&#x27;s text editing experience. Its so precise and short. I&#x27;m very used to changing text with up to 3 or 4 keystrokes to a precision that is very hard to get out of. I mean this in the best of ways, I really like Emacs and am having a lot of fun learning it. I&#x27;m just asking to better understand how I should go about this. I&#x27;d imagine that the text editing part is such a minor attribute of the power of Emacs and what its capable of that maybe it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference how one chooses to edit text.
 Thanks in advance 👍

                              <span>When I exit emacs with a file edited, I normally get prompted for if I want to save the file. This works great, but when I run emacs using emacs --daemon and I exit using :q, I am being asked if I want to save the current file. I have been able to get it working if I use C-x C-c, but not when exiting using evil mode. Do anyone know how to do this?

                              <span>Hi Emacsers,
 I&#x27;ve spent some time learning Elisp closures and lexical binding.
 Although the documentation is clear with simple examples, I needed to to play with other examples to get my bearings.
 As you might be interested, I share them with you :)
 The first section contains the info nodes and help corresponding to the examples.
 The second section shows 10 &quot;basic&quot; examples using lexical-binding, lambda, defun, let, lexical-let, setq and defvar.
 And the third section shows a more advanced example using lambda, let, dolist and defun.
 Have a nice day,
 ps: In the documentation, we can read &quot;Lexical binding is also more compatible with concurrency, which was added to Emacs in version 26.1.&quot;.
 Is someone know why is this? And can you indicate me the files in the emacs source code where …</span>

                              <span>I have configured emacs to be able to work with react and typescript using lsp, I also use eslint as a linter.I want to be able to fix lint error on save, to do so i&#x27;ve set &#x60;lsp-eslint-auto-fix-on-save&#x60; but when I save a linted file it mess up and for instance change all my 2 space indent to a 4 space wide tab, but the weird part is when resaving the file that as been messed up it&#x27;s been fixed as per my eslint configuration.I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs and it seems that there may be a conflict between two on save hooks but I really cannot figure out. You can find my conf here:https://github.com/sganon/emacs/blob/main/init.el
 If you know what I&#x27;m doing wrong or any step that can help me debug this problem that would be awesome.
 Thanks.

 EDIT: I&#x27;ve found that indeed there is a conflict between lsp-eslint-apply-all-fixes and lsp-format-buffer but I&#x27;m not sure why yet

                              <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;m using Emacs-IPython-Notebook with Elpy. It was a struggle to find the right documentation to get an initial setup up and running, but, I finally got these tools working, and I&#x27;m very happy now that I can develop Jupyter Notebooks in Emacs.
 Anyways, my question has to do with being able to run Python/JavaScript Widgets in Emacs, specifically in Emacs-IPython-Notebook(and emacs-jupyter as well). I did try last year to run pywidgets in EIN, but it did not work. Anyways, I was reading a article in r/emacs a while back(I can&#x27;t find it anymore, lol) about Emacs now being able run browser widgets. So that&#x27;d be great to get that working, so that I can run browser Widgets in Emacs.
 Could any of you enlighten me on this issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>wgrep is a super useful mode, and combining it with git grep would be even much more of a game changer. Is there a way to make it work?
 Running M-x grep and then changing that command to use git grep instead of regular grep works for displaying the results, but when I do wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode, it won&#x27;t let me modify and save the results.

 Hi! I upgraded to org-roam v2 about two months ago after using v1 for a few months before that. I felt org-roam-server quite useful primarily for visualizing which ideas link to which others. However, I haven&#x27;t felt the same introauitiveness with org-roam-ui (the server counterpart for v2). And the graph always seems too cluttered and rather difficult to use for purposes of idea-link visualization. Has anyone else felt this? Is it just a matter of getting used to?
 PS: org-roam-ui certainly is useful for checking nodes and obtaining a visually appealing overview of the personal knowledge base. But something feels off. I wonder if it is related to different coloring algorithms, wherein org-roam-server seems to color &quot;daughter&quot; nodes close to the parent node, especially if the parent node is a &quot;hub&quot;, whereas org-roam-ui seems to use no such heuristic. Just a guess!

I&#x27;ve since learned enough to &quot;get started&quot;, kind of grok emacs beginner fundamentals and simple navigation, and I feel VERY good about my progress. I wanted to share how I got to this point. Also, fyi I decided to start with plain emacs since most tutorials and internet reference materials are based on this.
 My learning method:
  
Start with built in tutorial. Practice each command shown a few times. Do as much as I can each day. 5 min, 10 min, an hour, whatever. NEVER use the mouse to move the insertion point or switch windows! ALWAYS use standard keyboard commands.

 I&#x27;ve been waiting for a database with a better query language ever since rethinkDB died. Specifically, EdgeDB stores object graphs natively, has a neat and composable query language, native migrations, etc. It&#x27;s easy to imagine how we could build type-safe queries for this. (Take a look at the typescript bindings on the main page)
 Is anyone already working on a client for EdgeDB?

                              <span>Shamelessly reposting a question from Stack Overflow: How to use literal haskell functions in DSL?
 Given the attention effect systems have had, I thought I&#x27;d convert a monomorphic transformer stack into an MTL-style effect and but ran into the following issue, likely due to my effect becoming polymorphic, the related recursive helper type class Fun became polymorphic and stopped working.. 
 The issue (same as on SO):
 I&#x27;d like to use literal haskell functions in a dsl as follows:
 haskell program :: forall m . DSL m &#x3D;&gt; m () program &#x3D; do stm $ Stm (Var &quot;a&quot;) -- this way: f  do -- function body is of the same monad &#x60;m&#x60; as the one in top level stm $ Stm (Var &quot;b&quot;) stm $ Stm $ Apply f (Var &quot;c&quot;) pure () 
 .. and turn the above into code ([Stm]).
 To make t…</span>

 I would like a way to define folds, In html, Its:
  Fold Title Thing to be folded  
 But I don&#x27;t know how to achieve that in org, as far I know I need to define my own markup and then tell org how to export to html? but I dont know elisp or org all that well, I only started using emacs a few weeks ago 
 and another is being able to Content to highlight it, like with drawing a box or using a highlighter on paper 
 If anyone could help, that would be much appreciated, This is on emacs 29 and org 9.5

                              <span>Hi,
I&#x27;m new on the forum but been reading the articles and the forum since I discovered ZK not long ago. I love it and it already changed my life and the way I work and the way I see what I do. I find the philosophy of it life changing.
Anyway, I have a question I can&#x27;t find the answer too.
Quite some times I read articles that provide a step by step for something, and acronym immediately useful. I don&#x27;t see how I can &quot;put it in my own words&quot;. I could but I feel like it&#x27;s spending time on stuff I really do understand and use. It&#x27;s more like reminders of processes than &quot;knowledge&quot;. The subject fits already into my train of thoughts and the stuff I&#x27;m working on.
What do you do with that kind of notes ? Do they go into the permanent folder ? Do they stay as some kind of literature notes ? How one would find those reminders / process / short tips in a ZK ?
Thanks</span>

This correspondence is known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence and relates:
  
Haskell types with objects of the category
 
Terms of type A→B with morphisms f:A→B (note the similar notations)
 
Algebraic datatypes with initial objects
 
Type constructors with functors
 
etc
 
  
What are algebraic datatypes in Haskell? (I thought all types, including those types defined by datatype, newtype, or type, and/or those types provided by the language and by the standard library modules, are algebraic datatypes. So I think I was wrong.)
 Is the concept &quot;abstract datatype&quot; the same to all the programming languages?
 How are algebraic datatypes related with initial objects?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi guys
 I have been struggling for a few days to figure out how to do this. The majority of resources for Alex / Happy seem to be very outdated, but I&#x27;ve had the most luck with this one: https://github.com/jmoy/alexhappy/blob/master/whitespace/Lexer.x
 It seems to target an old version of Alex though, as when building I get a bunch of compiler errors.
 Here is my code: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/yn3JWSrhAnd these are the errors I get: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/fTZhuGeTAlex version 3.2.6
 Also, when writing monadic parsers / lexers, should I still use the monad wrapper if I define my own monad type?
 Any help appreciated

                              <span>I need to create a function that reads from a list of courses (such as the one shown below), and return which courses has the largest number of programming languages.
 Here is the list
  progLanguages &#x3D; [ (&quot;CptS121&quot; , [&quot;C&quot;]), (&quot;CptS122&quot; , [&quot;C++&quot;]), (&quot;CptS223&quot; , [&quot;C++&quot;]), (&quot;CptS233&quot; , [&quot;Java&quot;]), (&quot;CptS321&quot; , [&quot;C#&quot;]), (&quot;CptS322&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;]), (&quot;CptS355&quot; , [&quot;Haskell&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;, &quot;PostScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;]), (&quot;CptS360&quot; , [&quot;C&quot;]), (&quot;CptS370&quot; , [&quot;Java&quot;]), (&quot;CptS315&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;]), (&quot;CptS411&quot; , [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C++&quot;]), (&quot;CptS451&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;C#&quot;, &quot;SQL&quot;]), (&quot;CptS475&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;R&quot;]) ] 
 It needs to be compatible with the following
  The type of the max_count function should be compatible with one of the following: max_count :: [(a1, [a2])] -&gt; (a1, Int) max_count :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; [(a1, t a2)] -&gt; (a1, Int) 
 So far, I have attempted the following code
  max_count [] &#x3D; error &quot;bad&quot; max_count [x] &#x3D; x max_count (x:xs) &#x3D; x max_helper (max_count xs) where max_helper (a,b) (a&#x27;,b&#x27;) | length b &gt; length b&#x27; &#x3D; (a, length b) | otherwise &#x3D; (a&#x27;, length b&#x27;) 
 This has not worked in the slightest, and I am at a blank for what to do. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I recently switched to an M1 Pro machine and decided to give Nix a try. I&#x27;m using Home Manager and nix-darwin, and having trouble figuring out the idiomatic way to set up a development environment.
 What I used to have
  
Intel Mac
 Stack installed with Homebrew, using managed GHC 8.10.3 (Stackage LTS 17.2)
 haskell-language-server installed manually, integrated with Neovim through ALE
  
What I want
 I am trying to minimize reliance on Rosetta, since I&#x27;ve read nasty things happen when combining x86 and ARM toolchains. As a result, I’d like to upgrade my project to GHC 8.10.7 to take advantage of the ARM-native binary. Eventually, I&#x27;d like to migrate this project to Cabal, because HLS and Stack don&#x27;t play well together in test files.
 I&#x27;d also like to start new projects using GHC 9.2.1 to …</span>

 Anyone can help? Thank you a lot.

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I have a number of latex export classes defined in my init file like so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes &#x27;(&quot;my-landscape&quot; &quot;\input{/home/user/.config/emacs/tex/class-my-landscape.tex} [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES] &quot; (&quot;\section{%s}&quot; . &quot;\section{%s}&quot;) (&quot;\subsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\subsection{%s}&quot;)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; As you can see, I include another tex file as a preamble and that works quite well.
 However, I would like to get to work on a landscape A4 multiple column class and for this it is suggested one uses \usepackage{multicols} in the preamble, easy enough added to the .tex file. 
 And here is where it gets tricky, one needs to add the line \begin{multicols}{3} after \begin{document} and \end{multicols*} before \end\document}. This is proving to be not trivial to set up for me.
 Does anybody have tips and or suggestions on how to tackle this issue ?
 thx S

                              <span>Here in the org manual, the zero-width space character is the recommended escape for would-be org syntax. Why this choice? An invisible character adds confusion and ambiguity. To me a better solution would be more explicit, perhaps a single-line comment character like the # of python. Or maybe it is a good solution, and I&#x27;m not using org the way it was intended? Help
 Edit: this SO post has some discussion

                              <span>I love Org&#x27;s date parsing abilities and often don&#x27;t even glance at the calendar that pops up, but occasionally I scroll through the calendar (with  or M-v and C-v) a bit before typing a date and it always surprises me that when I press RET the timestamp Org inserts is the date that was selected in the calendar and not the result of parsing what I typed!
 It seems that if you want Org to parse the date you type you cannot interact with the calendar pop up at all, which I find a little frustrating. Is there an easy way to tell Org &quot;forget I scrolled the calendar a bit, use the date I&#x27;m typing?&quot;.

 The dtache package, is a package for detached shell commands https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache.
 This is a good alternative for those that want to use dtache but who are not keen on using shell or eshell.

                              <span>Using Manjaro Cinnamon.
 So a few weeks ago, I built Emacs with support for background-only transparency (it&#x27;s awesome btw). The build was a little buggy, but after building, I decided to install it using &#x27;make install&#x27; - having followed some comments on this sub and elsewhere that the side-by-side install would work, since the default directory would be my &#x27;local&#x27;, separate to where Arch puts pacman packages (where my normal Emacs is) - for safety I used the prefix option and called it &#x27;TRANemacs&#x27;.
 But the background-only transparency emacs remained a bit buggy so I decided to uninstall using &#x27;make uninstall&#x27;. Upon running my normal emacs, everything seemed to work normally except that the Cinnamon task bar shows an empty icon where the Emacs logo should be. Further digging shows that emacs has a logo, but emacs-client (which I guess is what gets started) doesn&#x27;t. I reinstalled emacs with pacman but there is no change.
 Further to that, worth noting that it seems like &#x27;make uninstall&#x27; did not cleanly remove everything related to TRANemacs, but I don&#x27;t think the files left behind (e.g. the site-lisp folder) are very important.
 I&#x27;m not great at solving this sort of problem. Might anyone know how can I return the logo to emacs? And how do I prevent multiple emacs installations from clobbering each other in future?

                              <span>I have just reworked dired-auto-readme, fixed some bugs and made it aware of org-view-mode, so now it is possible to see readme files written in org mode without markup in Dired buffers. For example, here is a screenshot of org-tree-slide package by T. Ishikawa, cloned from his GitHub repo.

                              <span>It doesn&#x27;t exist yet, lol. But it&#x27;s an idea I just had. I don&#x27;t have the skill to do anything like this, but maybe someone else (or a group of people) do. It would contain music maybe starting slow and crescendoing throughout the commercial. Short scenes of individuals doing crazy complicated physical, artful, skillful /r/nextlevel kind of stuff, interspersed with crazy text on a screen moving around (typical org mode stuff, LaTeX editing, etc.), matrix looking stuff, more individuals performing high precision things, etc. Building up, and then ending with a finale and &quot;Emacs&quot; with logo on the screen. Fade to black. 
 I&#x27;ve read a few posts here and there about the need to get more people into Emacs. They usually focus on &quot;how to change emacs to appeal to a wider audience&quot;. I&#x27;m not going to touch that subject, but simple marketing can be powerful. When I search google for &quot;Emacs Commercial&quot; I get a grand total of 20 results (none of which is a commercial). Youtube returns zero.
 Surely there&#x27;s some skillful people out there, passionate about Emacs, who would also like to work on or collaborate on a few commercials? I could see another commercial that has testimonials from people.
 FYI, I&#x27;m an emacs newbie, and am excited about learning it. Apologies in advance if this isn&#x27;t a good idea or if this kind of post doesn&#x27;t belong here.

                              <span>Hello.
 I often need to act with Embark not on the symbol or plain value, but rather on the result of its evaluation. For example I&#x27;d like to be able to open the value of user-emacs-directory by using embark-act on this symbol. Is there some trick I&#x27;ve missed?
 I tried using M-: after embark-act as it could work as a workaround, but I didn&#x27;t find a way to make it ask me to edit the resulting expression either.
 Could someone nudge me in the right direction? An info how to force embark to show me an interactive prompt for some commands (like it already does OOTB for some) would be a nice bonus.
 EDIT: It seems the latter is possible by customizing embark-target-injection-hooks (link). I correctly remembered there was a variable directly controlling this behavior but it was removed since then, hence why I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.

                              <span>People seemed interested in the dnd evironment that i had setup for myself. So, I decided to separated it from my personal config and move it into separate repos. 
 The org file SRD
 The dnd-mode
 The documentation in these is lacking still, but I plan on adding more information about usage. Until then, if anyone would like to try it out they are welcome to ask questions to get up and running. Right now the mode has a dependency on &#x27;org-mode&#x27; and &#x27;yasnippet&#x27;. It is also expecting that the repos be cloned to your &#x27;~&#x27; directory by default (you can change it if you want).
 I do not currently have an examaple of a campaign, because I only have paid for campaigns setup for my personal. If anyone wants to provide a small campaign they made I would add it as an example, I sadly don&#x27;t have one at the ready right now, however. 
 Again, I am happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try it.

                              <span>Greetings,
 ​
 Whenever I run &#x60;jupyter-notebook&#x60; in a terminal, it opens and works just fine in a web browser, but, whenever I try to open a &#x60;New Notebook&#x60; with EIN, I get this error?
 ​
 &#x60;error in process sentinel: ein:insert-read-only: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, t error in process sentinel: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, t&#x60;

                              <span>UPDATED: I have modified the example to remove any dependency on external packages.
 I must be misunderstanding something quite basic here, so I&#x27;ll ask this question in the hopes that someone can spot the error. I may have to dig deeper otherwise, but I&#x27;m somehow thinking the issue is fairly superficial and I&#x27;m just not seeing it. 
 Consider the following function: 
  (defun my/test-let-fun () (interactive) (let* ((var &quot;Hello&quot;)) (print var) (if (bound-and-true-p var) (print &quot;Yes.&quot;) (print &quot;No.&quot;)))) 
 I add this to my config, and the following happens when I call the function.
  
In the minibuffer, I see &quot;Hello.&quot; followed by &quot;No.&quot;
  
What I take from this is that (bound-and-true-p var) must be returning nil, since otherwise I should see &quot;Yes.&quot; So, I conclude: 
  
The variable var must either be unbound or have a nil value during the evaluation of the body of the let* expression.
 The variable var is bound to a non-nil value, since otherwise, I couldn&#x27;t get something other than nil as the output of (print var).
  
But these two things cannot be true together!
 Am I misinterpreting what&#x27;s going on? 
 If I am not, how can this be? Is there some other way to check if the value of a variable is non-nil? 
 Puzzlingly, if I define the function after starting Emacs (by calling eval-last-sexp, say), it works as I expect. (I see &quot;Hello&quot; followed by &quot;Yes.&quot;)

                              <span>Hi, I would appreciate advice about the following. I am currently using Embark, Consult, Orderless (and Marginalia).
 Desired action: I have a current buffer open that is &#x27;A&#x27;. I want to switch to a different buffer &#x27;B&#x27; (which may be anywhere), but I actually want to search buffer B and maybe copy some results over to the current buffer. This could be using consult-line or occur.
 How I am going about the above: 
  
switch buffer (consult-buffer) 
 
Hit embark-act on the desired buffer (bound to C-. as default)
 
Choose either C-s (embark-isearch) or C and l for consult-line 
 
However - the search chosen above always takes place on the current buffer A. I want to act on Buffer B that I chose in the minibuffer.
 
 My config for these packages is pretty vanilla, mostly borrowed off the README&#x27;s of these packages with some functions stolen from the authors of the packages.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have my packages be &#x27;fixed&#x27; to a specific version, and furthermore available via cloning my emacs git repository. The latter is a function of the fact that I sometimes work in (Windows) environments where emacs will seemingly not work under the proxy no matter what I try. That&#x27;s fine, in those environments I don&#x27;t really need emacs connecting to the internet.
 But then, what package strategy to use? The only one that seems to somewhat fit the bill is Borg: however,
  
It uses submodules, and I reaaaaally don&#x27;t want submodules. I&#x27;d much rather use subtrees to commit in particular packages.
 There is no dependency management via this route whatsoever. I&#x27;ve played around with epkg, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly good way of managing dependencies-of-dependencies, unless I&#x27;m missing something obvious?
  
Does anyone else have a subtree leveraging workflow and have a relatively sane way of figuring out package dependencies?

 I do some writing, and while my emacs WINDOW is full screen (I use a tiling window manager) I want the text to wrap at a given column, but only visually; I don&#x27;t want actual linefeeds there.
 Not even sure what to search for. I want something like &#x27;visual-line-mode&#x27; that respects the fill-column value.

                              <span>Running gnome 41.3 on a recent arch linux, and recent emacs git with pgtk and native-comp. I&#x27;m lately getting ^M characters before the line feed whenever I paste (that is, yank) from certain applications. I especially notice gnome-terminal, and pdf text content copied from evince. Google suggests it&#x27;s a text encoding issue, but I created a new buffer, confirmed that buffer-file-coding-system is set to utf-8-unix, and also checked that gnome-terminal encoding is set to utf-8 (don&#x27;t know how to check in evince).The problem still persists. Yank is of course written in C so I can&#x27;t run edebug on it, and anyway I wouldn&#x27;t really know what to look for. 
  
Any suggestions for how to track this down? It is relatively new, but I am not sure *exactly* how long it&#x27;s been going on.
 If I can&#x27;t fix it, shouldn&#x27;t I be able to somehow filter the text in the kill-ring so that the &quot;M&quot; characters are removed before being inserted?
  
Thanks everyone!

 I want to search the full text of the files for all the terms of the input (terms separated by spaces), no matter where in the file they are or in what order. 
 So, if I search for &quot;apple banana&quot;, I want to find a file where &quot;banana&quot; is on line 1 and &quot;apple&quot; is on line 15. Since pretty much all search tools are line-oriented and/or keep the order of the terms and/or use &#x27;OR&#x27; matching instead of &#x27;AND&#x27; matching, I came up with a way to do what I want via a series of pipes. Something like:
 rg --ignore-case --files-with-matches --color&#x3D;never --null . -e &#x27;apple&#x27; | xargs -0 rg --ignore-case --files-with-matches --color&#x3D;never -e &#x27;banana&#x27;

                              <span>I am wondering if there is a decent way to take a url in Elisp and return different segments of it.
 My specific use case is that I want to take a invidious video url and return the video id without relying on a regexp monstrosity but such an ability has a lot of applications.

                              <span>I currently develop a little tool in which I would like to provide a temporarily visible help buffer containing cheat-sheet like content. And that content might be actually huge, so the user should be able to navigate the buffer.
 I plan to provide user options how and where that cheat-sheet might be shown (own frame, single windows with restoring current-window-configuration after close, side window left, right, top, bottom). My personal preference would be to open a new bottom window, as which-key does this for keybindings.
 The cheat-sheet mode would org, probably with a minor mode so that it is read only and can be closed with a single keystroke. I even think about using org-view-mode...
 Now my question is, what would be the best way to create and place the buffer? Shall I do it manually using basically split-window? Or is there something usable, probably the *Help*-buffers functionality as an official api? Or is it better to just create and show the buffer and let the user configure how to place it via display-buffer-alist?

                              <span>hi all,
 i have started using wucuo for spell checking. my configuration is pretty straightforward
 (use-package wucuo :ensure t :config ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; spell checking via &#x60;aspell&#x27; (setq ispell-program-name &quot;aspell&quot;) (setq ispell-extra-args &#x27;(&quot;--sug-mode&#x3D;ultra&quot; &quot;--lang&#x3D;en_US&quot; &quot;--run-together&quot; &quot;--run-together-limit&#x3D;16&quot;)) ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; disable spell checking in some major-modes (setq wucuo-spell-check-buffer-predicate (lambda () (not (memq major-mode &#x27;(dired-mode log-edit-mode compilation-mode help-mode profiler-report-mode speedbar-mode gud-mode calc-mode Info-mode))))) :hook (prog-mode . wucuo-start) (text-mode . wucuo-start) ) 
 this starts the spell checking as expected, and that works too. however, for source code buffers, i would like to run spell checker on comments only and not on the code itself. how do i do that ?

                              <span>Just started learning emacs (macport) about 10 days ago, Avy is the first package I&#x27;ve installed. So I have some questions.
 FIRST QUESTION Was there a particular reason for Oleh Krehel to suggest binding avy-goto-char to C-: instead of C-;? Since C-; doesn&#x27;t require the shift key, that would be seem to be a preferred binding for frequent navigation. (Perhaps colon C-; conflicts with some other popular binding?)
 SECOND ISSUE He suggests (from https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) possibly setting up default bindings using 
  
(avy-setup-default) 
  
But that doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. C-h b C-x o C-s avy fails to find anything.
 THIRD ISSUE [EDIT: ISSUE RESOLVED, THIS IS USED TO INTEGRATE AVY WITHIN AN ISEARCH.] Here&#x27;s a snippet from the documentation, I don&#x27;t understand this:
  
(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) &#x27;avy-resume)
 It will bind, for example, avy-isearch to C-&#x27; in isearch-mode-map, so that you can select one of the currently visible isearch candidates using avy.
  
How does binding to C-c C-j do anything to C-&#x27;? And what is isearch-mode-map? That function doesn&#x27;t seem to exist in my beginner level emacs. What does avy-resume do? I don&#x27;t understand any of this.
 FYI This is what I finally put into my .init.el file to get Avy to work:
 ;;; AVY BINDINGS https://github.com/abo-abo/avy ;; doesn&#x27;t seem to work ;;(avy-setup-default) ;; not sure what this does ;;(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) &#x27;avy-resume) ;; Suggested bindings from avy github docs (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-:&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char-2) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g f&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-line) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g w&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-1) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g e&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-0)

Edit: It is possible that I had some other packages installed than LSP related only, but I can&#x27;t tell because I just copy pasted few configs together, without thinking too much about it and hoping that it would work.
  
I remember having this neat feature which (among others) would allow me to expand macro by clicking on some text stating &quot;fix available&quot; which would pop up in the buffer itself, and i can&#x27;t get it to work. I do believe it had to do something with Flycheck package, but I might be wrong.
 It&#x27;s new feature, but very nice one: there is ref count displayed next to the function or variable declaration stating how many times this var/function h…</span>

It works in KDE plasma (kwin as compositor). I tried two compositors: xcompmgr and picom but nothing. Normal alpha parameter works fine.
 Anyone was able to make it work for EXWM?

                              <span>Does anyone have some elisp handy that scales latex previews along with text when using text-scale-adjust?
 I want to do this in both latex and org buffers, which use two different functions/features for this (preview-latex and org-latex-preview). If using dvipng (as opposed to to the dvisvgm method) I&#x27;m not looking to regenerate the previews at the new size, it&#x27;s OK if it stretches out the images when increasing the text scale.

 How do you review what you&#x27;ve worked on, what you have done etc?
 I&#x27;m aware of org-clock-report and maybe one day I&#x27;ll be disciplined enough to clock into everything. For now though all I&#x27;m managing to do is TODO -&gt; DONE. 
 So, do you do anything to summarize your weekly/etc tasks?

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure this has been answered a thousand times but I&#x27;m not easily finding the answer. 
 I just want to be able to look at my org-mode files from my phone or tablet. I don&#x27;t, right now, need to sync my agenda or anything like that -- mostly I just want to check my class notes and syllabus before I start reading to prep for lecture or seminar. 
 All my work files are synced via dropbox, so ideally it would be just a simple file reader that I can set so that org files &quot;open with&quot; that app from the dropbox app. Orgzly doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to do that, though it&#x27;s true that I can sync specific dropbox folders and access them from there. But mostly I&#x27;m going to be clicking on links, etc, rather than editing, and orgzly isn&#x27;t ideal for that. 
 So: anyone have a good solution? Thanks!

                              <span>Just wanted to take a moment to appreciate all that is Org-mode. I was a longtime vim user. My only emacs experience was an assembly course that I took many many years back that for some reason required it. Just over a year ago, I think, I started making a move to using org-mode for my to do lists. I started using templates and creating journal entries all in org. Then I moved into using org-roam for my notes at work and that morphed into using org-dailies and time tracking. With org-mode, I started moving all my ideas and things I wanted to remember, lists of books I&#x27;m reading or want to read. It goes on and on and it&#x27;s all organized in one nice neat (well, a little messy but relatively neat) little package. 
 Just wanted to share my appreciation for org-mode (and org-roam!) and for the community!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a paper, and I need a name for the subexpression examined by a case expression.
 So, for example, I have the expression case 1+2 of 3 -&gt; True
 What is the name for the expression 1+2? 
 I&#x27;ve seen it referred to as the scrutenee, but that&#x27;s long and kind of awkward. Is there a better name for this?

 I decided to create this open-source fork (with the author&#x27;s permission) to enable the Haskell community to participate in preserving and maintaining this awesome resource for future times. The idea behind the fork is to enable a way to submit and incorporate suggestions for edits and updates for LYAH from the community as Haskell evolves and changes. Additionally, it should be a zero-downtime version as in the past the original LYAH has had significant downtimes for long periods.

                              <span>My working method is similar to what @pgrhowarth has described here: In short, I always have to refer back to the original sources, in addition to my own ideas and conclusions. And this is not a personal choice, but a requirement of my profession.  But the &quot;output&quot; of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.
But I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. &quot;who quoted whom&quot;, &quot;who learned from whom&quot;, &quot;who wrote letters with whom&quot;, etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.
The question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two &quot;boxes&quot;, one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do &quot;double bookkeeping&quot; and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?
To reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.</span>

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m curious to know, most of the docs mentioned spark does the automatic partitioning. May I know which line or part of spark code base does this automatic processing for data partitioning for different worker node? Any suggestions

                              <span>Long time ago I came across a post on the internet (seemingly found in stackoverflow, but can&#x27;t find it now) that implements a breadth first search for a binary tree using map, flatten, flatMap. I try recall my memory, but I couldn&#x27;t remember how to implement that because I am not familiar with FP concepts. The part that I can remember ​ case class Node[T](v: T, left: Option[Node[T]]&#x3D;None, right: Option[Node[T]]&#x3D;Node) { def map[R](f: T &#x3D;&gt; R): R &#x3D; f(v) def flatten &#x3D; ... // flatten def flatMap &#x3D; ... // which combines map and flatten } But I can&#x27;t remember the part about flatten (the problem I suppose is I don&#x27;t know what I want to flatten for that ⠀Node object), and then flatMap. Any hint or suggestions on this? I suppose this can help me learn a lesson by implementing the code. Thanks

                              <span>So, I started learning Haskell and I&#x27;ve managed to get the basics up to creating my own little project. Since I wanna become proficient in it and eventually work coding in Haskell I want to ask you: - Is there any material you recommend for me to read/watch for making the transition from beginner to intermediate? - I&#x27;m mainly interested in data science and I learned about the existence of dhHaskell but I didn&#x27;t found any beginer friendly project for me to test. Is there any reository of examples to tinker and learn? (I&#x27;m painfully non creative when it comes to finding a project) (Edit posted this from my phone and mistakenly post it empty!)

                              <span>Background: I&#x27;m fairly new to Haskell, I can use the language but I am very unfamiliar with the overall build tooling. I largely just use what is recommended in my work project.
 So I got a new M1Pro. I&#x27;m the second on my team to do so. They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I&#x27;m stumped, so I&#x27;m turning to you for help.
 The project I&#x27;m trying to build is open source (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our HACKING.md page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn&#x27;t have llvm installed, so I brew install llvm&#x27;d, symlinked into $PATH, and tried again. This failed due to:
 install_name_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd&#x3D;0x80000034) &#x60;install_name_tool&#x27; failed in phase &#x60;Install Name Tool&#x27;. (Exit code: 1) 
 My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed llvm@12. So I removed llvm and its $PATH symlink, installed llvm@12, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!
 ... But I can&#x27;t link. I&#x27;m now failing on this:
 Building library for byteorder-1.0.4.. [1 of 1] Compiling System.ByteOrder ( System/ByteOrder.hs, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.o, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.dyn_o ) ar: @/dist/build/objs-29886/ar29886-2.rsp: No such file or directory 
 We found a post where someone had a similar issue (here), but the fix in that issue doesn&#x27;t help: using ar from binutils causes link errors like this instead:
 Linking dist/build/hspec-discover/hspec-discover ... ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/kit/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/hspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40/lib/libHShspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40.a, building for macOS-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for macOS-arm64 
 So I&#x27;m kinda lost at this point and hoping someone has tips. If you read this far, thanks for your time!

Does it mean that an instance of Monad is also an instance of Applicative? I was wondering how to see an instance of Monad is an instance of Applicative? Can  of Applicative be rewritten in terms of &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and return of Monad?
 
Is an instance of Monad also an instance of Functor? Can fmap of Functor be rewritten in terms of &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and return of Monad?
 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to get into Functional Programming, and I really like all the things I read about Haskell as a language, but I&#x27;m being driven to find something else almost entirely by what I can find about cabal. Like, I can&#x27;t uninstall a package? Really?
 Although most posts about &quot;cabal hell&quot; seem to be almost a decade old I can&#x27;t really find if anything has changed to abolish it. The closest I&#x27;ve read is someone somewhere mentioning Nix as an alternative to Cabal; is that Nix as in NixOS? Are people really using a system package manager to manage their Haskell packages, or have I completely missed the point? Separate from Nix, is Cabal good now or should I stay away?

 (2) In category theory, a morphism is from an object to another object i.e. o_1-&gt;o_2. 
  
Is there a name for a generalized morphism from more than one objects, i.e. o_1-&gt;o_2-&gt;...-&gt;o_n?
 
Is there a name for a generalized category with such generalized morphisms?
 
Is there a name for a generalized functor for such generalized categories?
 
 Is it correct that the instances of the Applicative class are exactly such generalized endo functors on such a generalized category of Hask?
 Thanks.

 I&#x27;d like to remove comments in a minified css stylesheet, and to do so, I&#x27;m curling the stylesheet and trying to regex replace the comments with \/\*(.|\n)*?\*\/; however, while it works with a regex tester, it doesn&#x27;t work in replace-regexp-in-string. I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to escape the \*, the brackets, and the newline character, but is there any way to escape whatever is needed, without me having to remember to translate a regular regexp to an elisp regexp?
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                              <span>What exactly is the difference between the auto-save-list directory that is always generated by default in .emacs.d and the the auto-save directory that we typically want to change by using the auto-save-file-name-transforms function? the latter, by default uses the temporary-file-directory, which is typically the local machine&#x27;s /tmp/ folder. both are for auto-save files? but what exactly are the difference though? the auto-save-list directory holds auto-save file of the &quot;STATE&quot; of your emacs? and has the save.hostname files for when the system unexpectedly crashes and you want to RECOVER your emacs to the previous state? and the auto-save-file-name-transforms/temporary-file-directory holds the #BLAH# files of the file you&#x27;re currently working on and saved at a regular interval?
 Question regarding where to place (package-refresh-contents)
  
 (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) 
 (package-refresh-contents) 
 (package-install &#x27;use-package))
  
currently i have this... but in this, (package-refresh-contents) will basically only ran once EVER - during the initial setup, since that&#x27;s the only time the system will not have use-package installed. should i perhaps place that line before (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package)? so that it is run everytime when i start up emacs? there&#x27;s pros and cons to this right? the pro is that, the package cache/info will be up to date everytime and i can just install packages right away through the commands as the package repos will be all up to date already... the cons is that, i doing so, it will dramatically slow down the startup time &#x27;cuz emacs will spend a lot of time updating the package cache right? and this is probably not worth it since we typically want to run package-list-package interactively anyway when we want to look for packages interactively and it will update the cache at that time anyway

                              <span>I am running evil in Emacs, and use the leader key extensively. 
 I have set Space as evil-leader and assigned a key to it as follows:
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal my-intercept-mode-map (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) &#x27;evil-send-leader) (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;a&quot;) &#x27;my/foo-bar) 
 When I run describe-key followed by SPC a, I would it to take me to my/foo-bar. Instead it takes me to evil-send-leader.
 How can I have describe-key SPC a take me to my/foo-bar?
 In Doom Emacs this worked, but running my own config I cannot find how to get this to work. 
 TIA!

                              <span>My OCD would really need a package where I can indent lists and similar structures with leading commas, i.e. /a la/ Haskell style, like in c
 c enum What { IN , THE , BUT } 
 or in python lists python a &#x3D; [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 I thought before I set myself into the indentation rabbit hole, maybe someone knows a package or a sipmle setting to set. Up to now I have been using from time to time haskell-indentation-mode but sometimes it screws some other indentation in the relevant programming language and I would really only &quot;need it&quot; for some comma separated special cases.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;d like to enter the Emacs (and Org-mode) world.
 I own a Mac and I&#x27;m confused.
 I see I can download Emacs by using Home-brew, but also from this link: https://emacsformacosx.com
 Are they the same version?
 Please consider I&#x27;d like to install Org-mode too.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I read here that defvar only sets the value of a variable if it doesn&#x27;t already have a value. 
 Then I tried to test it in scratch buffer, but could not verify that. defvar always sets the value no matter what. 
 Did some googling, found some stackover flow answers stating the same. 
 Got quite confused for quite some time. 
 Then decided to read elisp mannal, found this: 
  When you evaluate a top-level ‘defvar’ form with ‘C-M-x’ (‘eval-defun’) or with ‘C-x C-e’ (‘eval-last-sexp’) in Emacs Lisp mode, a special feature of these two commands arranges to set the variable unconditionally, without testing whether its value is void. 
 relieved. Isn&#x27;t this a bit strange? That it doesn&#x27;t work the same way when you want to test it out by C-x C-e

 ​
 Additionally, I put in my .emacs this snipped:
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c C-l&quot;) 
 ​
 but if I do C-c C-l g g on a symbol, it types &quot;g g&quot; instead of finding the definition.
 What gives?

                              <span>I need to manage 5 large projects, each with a number of subprojects, in orgmode. Each project comes with its own budget I need to keep track of, with a number of deadlines, but most importantly with a lot of back-and-forth, with reminding people via email, phone, or slack that their contributions are due. 
 All of these projects come with quaterly reports I have to write up. They include presentations and workshops or conferences. I can delegate some of the stuff, but I have to keep the overview at all times.
 Oh, and I have to keep track of the time i spend with each subtask. 
 So, I am actually trying to do this in orgmode. Has anybody done something similar and can share their insights, experiences or a template?
 Thanks!

 So 7-8 weeks of struggling with Swift and Emacs and I got it finally to work. A lot of people seems to have alot of problems with Swift and Emacs, lsp package stop working as soon as Apples LSP returns an error, but Eglot handle this much better but there are problems with LSP.
 First of all Apple doesnt want you to use LSP for Xcode projects, they officially stated this in their forums. It will not work with XCode projects, only swift packages. But most of us who works professionally uses XCode (.xcodeproj or a workspace).

 I also use org mode a lot.
 So I broke down and wrote a tool that lets me use the best of diigo for capturing and annotating and org mode for filing and expanding.
 In case anyone else uses both extensively, I&#x27;m sharing it here.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently started playing more DnD and convinced a co-worker to join me in both that and emacs. As a result of this I thought it would be fun to try to create a robust and interactive DnD environment inside of emacs.
 I have been working on my environment for a about three weeks now and have come up with a pretty good org file character sheet layout that uses table formulas to auto calculate everything based of the abilities that are defined.
 I have also been creating function to toggle my session target (a campaign or a character) to switch where my org-agenda and org-captures point so that I can leverage the searching and quick note taking that those provide.
 In addition to that I have been converting the SRD docs that I can find into ORG files that I can also search via org-agenda. Leveraging tags and properties to create queryable resources.
 ​
 I plan on creating a demo of this environment and sharing it, but that will require a decent amount of work. So, I was wondering what the interest would be in this crossover tool, or if people have solutions that they have developed for this.
 ​
 EDIT 1: Screen Capture of Character Creation
 ​
 Sorry, I noticed i missed the mini-buffer on the recording. The only relevant part was the dice roll at the end though for it. I also forgot to show the proficiency bonus column adds the PB as well. 
 ​
 EDIT 2: Searching the org file SRDs
 Sorry for the little windows. The tool I&#x27;m using for recording doesn&#x27;t give me many pixels :|

                              <span>An emacs beginner&#x27;s tutorial website (here) suggests looking at the value of system-name:
  
You should replace the system-name values with what you get when you evaluate (system-name) in your copy of Emacs. 
  
Whats the best way to do that? Use C-h v? Is there another way? 
 Regardless, one thing I&#x27;d like to be able to do (just to know if it&#x27;s possible) is highlight that web text, copy to the MacOS cut-and-past buffer, then in emacs, C-h v and it prompts me Describe Variable:. Is there a way to just paste/yank the name at that point? C-y didn&#x27;t work before, but now it does, so this use-case is solved.
 In another use-case, suppose I might have the variable name in my emacs buffer/window, with point on the variable name. Is there a way to &quot;send&quot; what&#x27;s under the point to C-h v for quick inspection?
 Or another way to &quot;evaluate&quot; the variable so that I can see what it is?
 I&#x27;m currently using Ido, if that matters. I&#x27;m also very new to emacs!

                              <span>Hello again. I found that function &quot;M-x fringe-mode&quot; can hide fringes only in all windows of all frames. I wanted do to that for one buffer. Its not that difficult but there is no interactive function for it. Or maybe there is?? If so please let me know.
 Anyway, there you have it. Yet another Emacs minor mode https://github.com/ir33k/fringe-hide
 Maybe it will be useful for someone. I personally like to have left fringe hidden, with wrap-mode enabled while typing some plain text that will be copied and pasted outside Emacs. Like this one ;d

                              <span>Dear org-mode-users, 
 I have a question regarding Python sessions in org-babel (started with the :session header-argument): What are your reasons -- if there are any at all -- to switch to a full-fledged Jupyter/Ipython-notebook, e.g. emacs-jupyter? I am wondering when to use which tool. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to start managing my tabletop RPG playing! I tend to both GM and play, so give me your best little tips, tricks, features, or even modes or plugins!
 I&#x27;ve tried managing a character sheet using headlines and tables, and it worked.....alright. it was just about as bulky (if not a little more due to my personal traversal inexperience) as just doing it in a writeable pdf or on paper.
 How do you go about it?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m a relative beginner to Scala and functional programming, but wanted to share a small project I&#x27;ve been working on. It&#x27;s a Snake game written in ScalaJS using a pull-based Functional Reactive Programming. The end result is complicated, but I think it has some interesting properties. Please take a look at the code and my small article. Interested to know what you think! Thanks

                              <span>I wrote a program to find the nth prime number between 1 and 100,005, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For example, the first prime number is 1, the second is 2, and the third is 3.
 Here&#x27;s my program:
 -- Get a range of list of numbers from begin to end, inclusive.range :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; [Integer]range begin end | end &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; [begin] | begin &gt;&#x3D; end &#x3D; [end] | otherwise &#x3D; begin : range (begin + 1) endcheckNotMultiple :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; BoolcheckNotMultiple a b &#x3D; r &gt; 0 || q  [a] -&gt; a -&gt; [a]eliminateMultiplesOfP list p &#x3D; filter (checkNotMultiple p) listeliminateMultiples :: Integral a1 &#x3D;&gt; [a1] -&gt; [a1]eliminateMultiples list | length list &gt; 1 &#x3D; head list : eliminateMultiples (eliminateMultiplesOfP (tail list) (head list)) | otherwise &#x3D; list-- Sieve of EratosthenesgetNthPrime :: Int -&gt; IntegergetNthPrime n &#x3D; (1 : eliminateMultiples (range 2 100005)) !! (n-1)
 As n increases, so does the time the program takes to access the nth element of the list. Why, and what can I do to make this not true?
 Hazarding a guess: Maybe GHC is smart enough to realize that it shouldn&#x27;t run eliminateMultiples on the entire list, despite what the code says, because I really only care about one element of the resulting array.
 EDIT: I should clarify that I don&#x27;t count a number as a multiple of itself.

                              <span>Hi haskell folk, thought I&#x27;d share this with you.
 For a workshop I am planning I want to ensure that everyone has a quick haskell development setup available, so I created a simple docker image based on haskell&#x27;s official image. This one includes code-server as a vs-code web IDE.
 The image can be found on docker hub and launched like so, assuming $PWD/code is where your haskell projects are: docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/code:/exercises arnemcnuggets/hs-workshop Notice that the default directory (currently /exercises) can be adjusted by changing the entry-point cmd (currently it&#x27;s code-server --auth none --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --user-data-dir /data /exercises).
 You can then navigate your browser to localhost:8080 and start programming haskell with linting, type hints and formatting.
 The environment is, of course, by no means to be used in production but rather for education.
 This is kind of the first docker contribution I made so feedback is welcome!
 Edit: it comes with dark-theme (my eyes) and the haskell vs-code extension preinstalled for extra little configuration.

                              <span>Just playing around with a tiny project, I&#x27;ve found that using HSpec with cabal repl would be really really nice. You could call main to run all the tests, or call hspec XyzSpec.spec to run just the tests you currently care about.
 Problem is that GHCi can only load one component at a time. That means I can&#x27;t do :r to reload code changes that aren&#x27;t in the test component. If I&#x27;m changing library code, then restarting the repl from Cabal all the time isn&#x27;t convenient as it is slow.
 As a hacky solution, if I add the library&#x27;s src dir to my test&#x27;s hs-source-dirs then it works really nicely. Things reload very quickly. But once you start needing build dependencies in the library, you also need to add them to the test project. This starts to feel a bit messy, build tools for other languages don&#x27;t require hacks like this.
 Is there a better way to do this? I know there&#x27;s stack test --file-watch but this is very slow. I&#x27;m looking to to make tiny changes rapidly, and the time it makes you wait while it builds the project over and over is inconvenient when compared to the instant reloading in GHCi.

 class Functor f where fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b 
 The Functor class is used for types that can be mapped over. Lists, IO, and Maybe are in this class. Instances of Functor should satisfy the following laws:
 fmap id &#x3D; id fmap (f . g) &#x3D; fmap f . fmap g

                              <span>Hi all,
 Finishing a project and looking to use a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. 
 I know the Euclidean distance formula sqrt of (a-c)2 + (b-d)2
 It would follow the function distance :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
 Ex: distance 3 5 3 5 will give back 0.0
 Having troubles putting this in correctly.

 Here&#x27;s a picture of me wearing my favourite Haskell t-shirt: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/832759?v&#x3D;4
 ​
 I would like to be able to get some more copies as presents, etc... but cannot find it being sold anywhere anymore... (I got it quite a number of years ago sadly) Does anyone have any ideas where I might be able to find this t-shirt for sale, or track down the designer?
 ​
 For those looking, I finally found this t-shirt: https://www.cafepress.com/mf/91716131/_tshirt?productId&#x3D;1342277923

 I&#x27;m trying to install Euterpea and Haskell School of Music on my Windows PC for a school project. I have already verified that my system has ghc 9.2.1 and haskell-dev 0.01 installed on it. When I run cabal install Euterpea however, it tells me that cabal.exe: The program &#x27;ghc&#x27; version &gt;&#x3D;7.0.1 is required but it could not be found. How can I rectify this? Thank you!

                              <span>My attempt at pretty rendering paragraphs in org-mode: aligned vertically to left, right, middle and displayed with custom fonts.
 I have been hacking last weekend on my org-view mode. It can now prettify quotes, verses and centered paragraphs by applying alignment and custom faces to quotes, verses and if specified author names of those.
 Org-view should now also work in older versions than the current master :).
 At this time only available from the GitHub repository.

                              <span>I have my emacs config.org set to tangle to init.el automatically with the after-save-hook. I want to symbolically link all my org files to one org folder, but it seems like this breaks my auto-tangle setup. The strangest part to me is, when I navigate to /.emacs.d/ to open the original file, that won&#x27;t tangle either. So its not just using link that&#x27;s the problem. Its like having a link pointing to that file at all prevents tangle from working on that file. When I remove the link it goes right back to tangling. Does anyone know of a solution off hand?

When I split the diff and apply, it does so to a location that is incorrect.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m using LSP-mode for C++ and I can&#x27;t find how to pass arguments to clang-tidy. It&#x27;s annoying because I&#x27;d like to use C++17 functionalities which flycheck flags as illegal (though they are not). 
 My config does have (lsp-clients-clangd-args &#x27;(&quot;--clang-tidy&quot;)) but I don&#x27;t know how to pass arguments to clang-tidy, through clangd.
 Any combination I could think of, of &#x27;(&quot;--clang-tidy --std&#x3D;c++17&quot;), &#x27;(&quot;--clang-tidy&quot; &quot;--std&#x3D;c++17&quot;), &#x27;(&quot;--clang-tidy -extra-arg&#x3D;-std&#x3D;c++17&quot;),... failed. 
 I thought about using a .clang-tidy file instead but there&#x27;s no example of such a file in the clang-tidy docs. 
 Any help would be appreciated! 
 P.S: This issue can be reproduced with any post C++17 feature, such as std::optional.

                              <span>I&#x27;m following the tutorial here. It suggests I add lines to ~/.emacs.d/.emacs
  
;; You can change the path here
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/&quot;)
  
I created that file and then restarted emacs, but my load path didn&#x27;t change. I&#x27;m using mac port.

                              <span>This is the first production release of Scalqa project. 
 Scalqa was first introduced on Reddit last summer with the &quot;Scala3 Quick API&quot; post. Few more discussions followed:
  
Perfect Int Loop
 Perfect Time Library
 Boost data processing speed with heavy ops
  Void Request Pattern
  GUI Could Be Easy
  Creating New Numerical Types
  
So the feature set was pretty much complete long time ago and it took many months to refactor, refactor, and refactor. At this stage there are no good ideas on how the project can be improved any more, so it is time to stabilize the code base. From now on the future releases will be binary compatible with version 1.0 and any large changes will be rejected unless absolutely necessary.
 Maintenance wise, based on experience, I expect to spend from 1 to 4 hours a week to fix any incoming bugs and make a new release every 1-3 months. Otherwise, I will move on to invest/trade markets full time, using Scalqa as enabling technology. But, I am standing by to devote all my energy back to Scalqa if needed.

I&#x27;m new to this software, but I&#x27;ve tried many other apps that offer similar functions, including desktop wikis. regular wikis, and various notebook programs, some designed for programmers, some for writers. (I&#x27;m a writer.) My criteria are that the app must allow simple links, and save as separate plain text documents (not a database) which can be viewed in Finder and edited in other apps.
I&#x27;ve worked with text files for many years. What really sealed it for me was the experience of opening files from the 1980s. I could open old text files with ease, but not old word processor files, including files from Microsoft Word 2.0.
I used to use Windows, and there I used WikidPad, which was easy, very customizable, and could be set t…</span>

 I was hoping that undo relies on some sort of recording of user action, but I have not found much so far! Do I need to write my own code for this feature?

If I open a pdf file in emacs, it first opens in doc-view-mode. I can manually enable pdf-view-mode using M-x which works fine. This doesn&#x27;t at all match with what I&#x27;ve seen online. I&#x27;m using straight.el as a package manager, and I&#x27;m installing pdf-tools with (use-package pdf-tools)
 ETA: I have straight-use-package-by-default set to t earlier in my config
 Any idea what&#x27;s going on?

 Here is my summary. Video is of 15 minutes.
 Button is a metaphor for shortcuts. You always wanted a big red button to launch something based on the context. Hyperbole makes that possible. Buttons are both for novice and experts. And probably helps novice to become experts by learning more about Emacs.
 Buttons can be created in personal button file (~/.hyperb/HYPB), directory specific button file (HYPB), in the current buffer (org, python, any other). Location of the button defines how they can be accessed. For exampl…</span>

                              <span>I just started using Helm, so I imagine this is a common question to which I am not able to find an answer...yes I&#x27;ve heard of google ;-)
 I&#x27;d like to use Helm to search through my org-roam notes for a keyword...not just the titles, but the content in the files/notes for all notes in the roam directory. I have seen helm-occur and it looks great, but from what I&#x27;ve seen it only works on open buffers. So what I&#x27;m looking for is helm-occur results for all files in a specified directory.
 I got this working on Dired...well someone else did and yes, I copied it. I&#x27;m hoping to replicate the same functionality with Helm...
 Thanks for any pointers!

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 29 - freshly compiled a few days ago - but I see the same behaviour with emacs 27. 
 &gt; emacs --version GNU Emacs 29.0.50 (use-package delsel :ensure nil :init (delete-selection-mode 1)) 
 When some region is active - if I type directly the region is replaced by whatever I type - due to delete-selection-mode working as expected. 
 However if I try to yank (C-y) some text to replace the region there is no effect. If I immediately yank-pop M-y after that, the region is replaced by whatever was pushed to the kill ring before the yank. When I hit C-y I see a message in the minibuffer saying &quot;Mark set&quot;.
 The same is true if I use the menu to yank. If I try M-x yank the text I expect to replace the region with is inserted before the region. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s something weird abou…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve discovered the rather awesome Hydra package, and I like all things about it, except one: I want hydras to function only on keys defined. Easy-peasy... EXCEPT, mouse scrolling should work too, and here I&#x27;ve run into the fact that I don&#x27;t really know how emacs works. I&#x27;ve seen this is a question on the issue tracker without resolution:
 https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/issues/390
 I see that as I scroll the mouse, or more accurately touchpad, I get wheel-down/double-wheel-down/triple-wheel-down (or up) and these are all mapped to the same (Mac specific?) event: mac-mwheel-scroll but as expected, mapping all the various mouse events I see in lossage to mac-mwheel-scroll doesn&#x27;t work. In fact, mapping them even to normal scroll events only SORT of works.
 Anyone have any hints? My temporary &quot;solution&quot; is to just use the hydra that allows for other keys, but that is causing some serious OCD. I was thinking of defining a pre command hook that detects whether I am in a hydra and what the command is, but that seems like a hack if there ever was one. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi,
I have recently discovered Zettelkasten in my search for an information management tool. I have used TiddlyWiki and TheBrain before, and I&#x27;m a great fan of the idea of interconnected &quot;atomic&quot; thoughts. I&#x27;m trying to adapt this system to my work. Unfortunately, it is far from academic literature research which seems to be the classic application of Zettelkasten.
I manage reliability test of semiconductor products. I deal with a lot of interconnected information for product reference and project tracking. For example, a product is made using a certain technology and may have several part numbers using different package types. The same package types or technologies can be used for other products. Qualification includes several reliability tests, each done on several lots. Each lot/test is…</span>

                              <span>... I guess pure FP guarantees us referential transparency, but does not say anything about the process to compute to normal form  are these concepts related?
 We have IO, which encapsulates IO operations like read, write, open, close on the filesystem or network layer, but it would be nice to have something similar to resource management and deterministic memory allocation tactics.
 Rust goes in that direction, but is further away from the functional paradigm.
 Happy coding and happy sunday!

                              <span>I am a Haskell sceptic and despite a few attempts to learn it I never had much success. I part my excuse is bad quality of some tutorials that you find at the beginning of your journey. I still keep bumping into surprises about the fundamentals of Haskell.
 Today such surprise was the podcast &quot;God&#x27;s Programming Language&quot; with Philip Wadler. https://corecursive.com/021-gods-programming-language-with-philip-wadler/# 
 To my surprise around the 32nd minute, they talk about types. There I learn that the types used in functional programming, despite the same word being used, are not the same as types used in languages that inherit from Fortran. 
 Do you think that tutorials that start with Strings and Integers lead you down the wrong path? How can I tell what is executed at the compilation stage and what is executed at the runtime stage?
 If I were to have another go would I be able to find a tutorial that explains and builds on correct principles?

4.2.3 Datatype Renamings
 ...
 The following examples clarify the differences between data (algebraic datatypes), type (type synonyms), and newtype (renaming types). Given the declarations
 data D1 &#x3D; D1 Int data D2 &#x3D; D2 !Int type S &#x3D; Int newtype N &#x3D; N Int d1 (D1 i) &#x3D; 42 d2 (D2 i) &#x3D; 42 s i &#x3D; 42 n (N i) &#x3D; 42 
 the expressions (d1 ⊥), (d2 ⊥) and (d2 (D2 ⊥)) are all equivalent to ⊥, whereas (n ⊥), (n (N ⊥)), (d1 (D1 ⊥)) and (s ⊥) are all equivalent to 42. In particular, (N ⊥) is equivalent to ⊥ while (D1 ⊥) is not equivalent to ⊥.
  
(1) What are d1, d2, s, and n in
 d1 (D1 i) &#x3D; 42 d2 (D2 i) &#x3D; 42 s i &#x3D; 42 n (N i) &#x3D; 42 
 ?
 Are they used without having been defined? If yes, why do they not need to be defined? If no, where have they been defined?
 (2) Why
  
the expressions (d1 ⊥), (d2 ⊥) and (d2 (D2 ⊥)) are all equivalent to ⊥,
 
(n ⊥), (n (N ⊥)), (d1 (D1 ⊥)) and (s ⊥) are all equivalent to 42,
 
(N ⊥) is equivalent to ⊥ while (D1 ⊥) is not equivalent to ⊥
 
 ?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Another newbie question.
I&#x27;m moving thousands of existing text documents into TheArchive.
I&#x27;ve used NameMangler to add unique IDs (based on file creation time) to the start of all the files, so a group of files that looks like this...
Adobe Audition.txt
... gets turned into this...
2020-02-15 083059 Adobe Audition.txt
I then drop this list – thousands of files – into a text document called &quot;UNSORTED FILES.txt&quot; . Then with a grep-based search and replace in BBEdit, the list gets transformed into this...
[[2020-02-15 083059]] Adobe Audition.txt
Now I&#x27;ve got a document I can open and edit in TheArchive, and everything is nicely linked.
But I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s inside Sketch.txt and I&#x27;d like to add more details. If I click on the link, the file opens up and I can see it&#x27;s a comedy sketch I was writing about an inept iPad user. I&#x27;d like to add that information to the description in the UNSORTED FILES document, but how do I get back to where I came from? I can see UNSORTED FILES in the search results list, but if I click on it, I have to hunt for the filename I was editing, because there&#x27;s no cursor.
After clicking a bracketed link, is there a way to return to the originating document, with an active cursor in its previous position?


OR, is it possible to click on a bracketed link inside a document and open it in a new window or external editor?


OR is there another solution for quickly viewing the content of a bracketed link?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just published another post in my series on combinator-based evaluation of functional languages.
 In this post I present an alternative approach to combinator-based implementations that is significantly faster than classical graph-reduction based solutions.
 As this approach makes use of combinators directly implemented as Haskell functions, it is also much simpler and smaller in size than explicit graph-reduction.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time grappling with the seemingly hard combinatorial problem of working out what combination of bang patterns, INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas, worker/wrapper transformations, compiler options, etc. I need to use to speed up performance-critical parts of my Haskell projects (I mostly write CPU-bound work, e.g. mathematical software). While it&#x27;s always a relief when I stumble across a combination that gives a massive speedup, it&#x27;s often not clear to me why certain things make a big difference in some contexts but not in others (especially bang patterns and INLINE/INLINABLE pragmas). This makes me worry that I may just be overfitting my code to the quirks of the GHC version that I&#x27;m currently using (currently 8.10.7 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 machine), and that some of the fruits of my labour will be lost in future when I upgrade. So my questions are: 
  
Has anyone measured and publicly reported the amount of work that it took them to maintain the speed of high-performance Haskell libraries across GHC versions?
 Is there any guidance anywhere on what kinds of performance optimisations are likely to remain beneficial across GHC versions?
  
In case a concrete example would help, I&#x27;ve written a generic foldl&#x27; function for linear data structures (lists, pairs of lists, etc.). In a benchmark that I&#x27;ve written for a Wordle solver that I&#x27;m working on, I found that I can improve its performance by about 10% by unrolling one recursive call. I then tried unrolling two recursive calls, and the performance was about 8 times worse! So I tried adding INLINE, and the performance was about 16% faster than the original unrolled version. Here&#x27;s the code for the different versions: GenericFoldl.hs. Is there any good reason for me to think that future GHC versions will continue to make similar decisions about what to inline, so that the performance of unroll2_genericFoldl&#x27; won&#x27;t suddenly plummet after an upgrade?

 The sole and most unfortunate possibility, however, is that I recently installed Haskell Platform (on top of GHCup!) and I suspect that might have ruined things. Alternately, there is a console setting on Windows that&#x27;s been locked up by Haskell Platform or Winio, which I might be able to unlatch.

You can easily compose join with itself n times to remove nesting, but is it possible, language extensions permitted, to write a function akin to
  m (m (... (m a))) -&gt; m a  What would such a function look like and is there a better way of expressing such a type signature?

I wanted to use the same configuration on my windows and mac computers. Is it sufficient to simply upload my .emacs.d folder to my github and download it onto my other computers and have emacs work the same way? Basically, are there any other folders I should be aware of in order to copy over everything correctly from one computer to another?

 Didn&#x27;t find a solution in google either.
 edit
 I figured out what was wrong, should&#x27;ve used 
 (setq prettify-symbols-alist (copy-list my-org-tex-prettify-list) 
 instead of 
 (setq prettify-symbols-alist &#x27;my-org-tex-prettify-list)

 I have a custom project which a specific info file for which some function are referenced in the &#x60;Function Index&#x27; so accessible at the node &quot;(mylib)Function Index&quot;
 My INFOPATH environment variable is updated to include the &#x60;.info&#x27; and the &quot;dir&quot; has been also updated with &#x60;install-info mylib.info dir&#x27;, which makes it visible when looking for node with C-h i -&gt; m mylib

 Is there way to also register mylib.info withing info-look so when I hit &#x60;C-h S&#x27; I get the documentation of the related function at point ? 
 copying info-look.el I tried adding, without success, to my setup the function: 
 (info-lookup-maybe-add-help :mode &#x27;c-mode :topic &#x27;symbol :regexp &quot;\\(struct \\|union \\|enum \\)?[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*&quot; :doc-spec &#x27;((&quot;(mylib)Function Index&quot; nil &quot;^[ \t]+-+ \\(Function\\|Macro\\): .*\\&quot;) ) :parse-rule &#x27;info-lookup-guess-c-symbol) 
 Any help would be appreciated

                              <span>So today I&#x27;ve found that when displaying a particular window (for what it&#x27;s worth, it belongs to helpful) I am repeatedly getting an error message:
  Invalid face attribute :family nil 
 There is nothing obviously untoward actually happening, but the error message pops up constantly while I&#x27;m navigating in this window, so it&#x27;s extremely annoying, and I&#x27;d love to at least understand what&#x27;s going on. Especially considering that the likelihood of the bug actually being in helpful is not very high, it&#x27;s more probable that it&#x27;s somewhere else in my config -- I&#x27;ve seen it before, just less often.
 By digging through Emacs source, I&#x27;ve been able to find that the actual source of the message is face-attributes-as-vector, a function defined in xfaces.c. Deep in the C code. That&#x27;s the only place anywhere I can find this error message text.
 Now I&#x27;m trying to trace the calls to it to find out just where and what resulted in the nil :family and nothing seems to work, neither trace.el nor Edebug -- it just prints the message and goes off on its merry way. Manually advising it with something to the tune of (defun trace-face-attrs (a-plist) (message &quot;Tracing: %s&quot; a-plist)) (advice-add &#x27;face-attributes-as-vector :before #&#x27;trace-face-attrs) doesn&#x27;t result in advice function getting called either.
 It&#x27;s like the function isn&#x27;t actually getting called at all.
 How do I get at the root of this damned thing?

 Is any EXWM user have found/write a fix for that issue? Or is it only on my end?

                              <span>Okay, I can&#x27;t know what you are looking for, but I myself just wanted a simple way to store email addresses and insert them with completion when composing new messages. BBDB and the like are way too fancy for me.
 It turns out BBDB has a poor cousin, called &#x27;ecomplete&#x27;. To activate it, you just need to
 (setq message-mail-alias-type &#x27;ecomplete) 
 Alternatively, if you prefer to use the standard completion-at-point instead of ecomplete&#x27;s handicrafted UI (works well with Orderless or flex completion styles) you can use the following:
 (ecomplete-setup) (add-hook &#x27;message-sent-hook &#x27;message-put-addresses-in-ecomplete) (setq message-mail-alias-type nil message-expand-name-standard-ui t) 
 (I wish the above was less hacky to get working, but alas).
 This is ridiculously obscure stuff. I could only find ecomplete after imagining the feature and starting to study the places you need to understand to implement it... So I hope this is a helpful hint for some people :-).

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 ​
 My ipython console is getting super slow when the buffer is longer than ~10 000 lines (for example when I accidentally print a very long variable). 
 I know C-c M-o runs the command comint-clear-buffer (found in inferior-python-mode-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function. And running it manually solves my problem. Now, I would like to have it to run automatically when the *Python* buffer is longer than X lines, but can&#x27;t find how to do it. 
 One related issue is that I shouldn&#x27;t run into a long buffer limitation than quickly, i.e. I should prevent very long variables (e.g. long lists) from being entirely printed in the buffer. For instance, when print() is called, I would like to only print the first and last 10 entries of a variable if it is longer than e.g. 100 lines. However, here again, I can&#x27;t find how to do it...
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated, thank you a lot in advance! :)

                              <span>The manual for instrumenting macros states that part of the spec can be a symbol:
  
Any other symbol in a specification list may be a predicate or an indirect specification.
 If the symbol has an Edebug specification, this indirect specification should be either a list specification that is used in place of the symbol, or a function that is called to process the arguments. The specification may be defined with def-edebug-spec just as for macros. See the defun example.
 Otherwise, the symbol should be a predicate. The predicate is called with the argument, and if the predicate returns nil, the specification fails and the argument is not instrumented.
 Some suitable predicates include symbolp, integerp, stringp, vectorp, and atom. 
  
From this, it&#x27;s not clear to me what it means for a function to &quot;process&quot; the arguments. For example, I would like to see if the arguments match one of several specs. Something like
 (cl-dolist (spec my-specs) (when (edebug-apply spec args) (cl-return t))) 
 Is this possible?

 but received error that 2 ranges try to set @ 3$5 field,
 (i inserted @@#$$# in if statement cause it didn’t let me to leave it blank for “else do nothing”)
 2, So i tried
 @$&gt; &#x3D; if($# % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 1, if(vlen(@&gt;..0) &#x3D;&#x3D; 0, vsum(@&gt;), @@#$$#), ($-1/@&gt;$-1)*100)
 but now i can’t set ;%.1f formatting for only percentage columns
 Could someone please help?

                              <span>Hello,
 I wanted to read in a csv file, and convert that into a dataset to perform linear regression on. The condition is that the case class must make X a Spark vector, and Y a double.
 I&#x27;ve been trying a few methods so far, but I cannot figure out how I convert the Int type data in X to Spark vectors.
 I&#x27;d appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction.
 Thanks!
 X Y

 1, Firstly i tried 
 @&gt;$$&gt; &#x3D; if($# % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 1, vsum(@&gt;), @@#$$#) :: @$&gt; &#x3D; if($# % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0, ($-1/$&gt;)*100, @@#$$#)
 but received error that 2 ranges try to set @ 3$5 field,
 (i inserted @@#$$# in if statement cause it didn’t let me to leave it blank for “else do nothing”)
 2, So i tried
 @$&gt; &#x3D; if($# % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 1, if(vlen(@&gt;..0) &#x3D;&#x3D; 0, vsum(@&gt;), @@#$$#), ($-1/@&gt;$-1)*100)
 but now i can’t set ;%.1f formatting for only percentage columns 
 Could someone please help?

                              <span>Working most recently with Vue using the UI library Vuetify. It&#x27;s easy to create attractive UIs from a large widget library. And with a little theming there is hardly ever a need to touch CSS.
 Is there anything equivalent in PureScript?

                              <span>HI, 
 I see I cannot obtain from org as default a behavior quite useful for big files,coming from the mind map world I am quite deluded if cannot find a solution.
 what I would expect:
 Basically imagine I have a huge complex org file with 10 levels of indentation/nesting/nodes. as user I would like to go to an item  on let&#x27;s say level 7, and make gradually expand the item at the 8 level(only from children of  not all the org) , then 9 and 10 so that I can have a peek of what information is under that specific part, then go back from 9, to 8 and back to 7, to the original place where i was.
 ​
 What (delusionally) I get:
 is with shift+tab an iteration not useful at all collapsing all the items(?), then back when I am, then expand all the thousands of items I have in my huge org files.
 A remark: I know that few people recommend to make shorter org files separated files, but at the moment I have these huge files( as coming from the mind map world)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am currently setting up Org-Roam and I like to have a note with contact information for people I interact with regularly that I can then link to in every Task that is somehow connected to this person. 
 The linking itself works without any issues, but if I completed a task I tend to archive the task to a *.org_archive file to avoid clutter in my todo-lists. I would still like to see the backlinks to the archived tasks when I look at the note with the contact information, but unfortunately, org roam does not show the task anymore afterwards. 
 Is it possible to configure roam in such a way that it does not only look at the &quot;normal&quot; *.org files but also the *.org_archive files? 
 ​
 Thanks very much in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using ansi-term for a while, and I recently tried switching to vterm. It looks and works pretty well, but I&#x27;m having a problem with how vterm cycles through your command history. In zsh, if you type something and press the up arrow key, you get the last command you used that starts with what you&#x27;ve already typed. This works fine in ansi-term, but in vterm, it just cycles to the last command that was used in that vterm session. I was wondering if anyone knew if there was any configuring that I need to do on either end to get this to behave the same way in vterm as it does in ansi-term.
 ---EDIT--- Editing to clarify that it&#x27;s specifically the matching of the already typed command that&#x27;s not working. I can cycle through the history without issue, but sometimes I&#x27;m sshing onto a machine, or doing a repetitive task, and prefer to have zsh search for the right command for me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Doom emacs set up with vertico for completion..
 I would like to find a file to open, but... 
  
it is in my home directory somewhere, but I don&#x27;t know where
 I have only a vague recollection of its name and the name of the directory in which it resides.
  
If I were in my terminal emulator, I would navigate to ~, then emacs (or similar) then do a ~fzf~ search for the filename, while mashing in some of the directory name which I can remember. I&#x27;d then select the file from the list of suspects.
 What is the best way to get something like this happening with my vertico setup? 
 I like the way the ~ suffix works, I would just like it to go recursive, basically. I can&#x27;t use helm or ivy, as a package I have to use is incompatible.
 Hopefully this is super simple and I&#x27;m just missing something obvious.

                              <span>I’m looking for a way to make a copy a file named “filename.ext” and name it “filename_n.ext”, where n is the smallest integer such that there’s no file in the directory named “filename_n.ext”. 
 The following seems to sort of work, but I’d love to know if there’s a function out there with the right kind of reputation that could do the work without introducing any potential issues: 
 elisp (defun my/make-copy (file) (progn (setq new_file file) (setq index 1) (while (file-exists-p new_file) (setq new_file (concat (file-name-sans-extension file) “_” (number-to-string index) &quot;.&quot; (file-name-extension file))) (setq index (1+ index))) (copy-file file new_file)) 
 If not, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether you know of a better way of doing this. I’m still very much a beginner here… Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I have compiled and installed Emacs 28 pgtk.
 When I start Emacs it changes the background color three times.
 First it starts gray, then it turns white and then finally my theme color, which is a dark gray (from Nord color palette).
 My previous version, Emacs 27, honored the .Xresources and would start with the same color of my theme.
 I have tried running &#x27;xrdb -merge .Xresources&#x27; before running Emacs. It did not help.
 I am running Emacs inside i3wm, which uses xorg. Everything else runs fine.
 Is it possible that Emacs-pgtk does not honor the .Xresources anymore?
 Do you think it is a bug?

                              <span>When I&#x27;m writing, I usually start typing in a &quot;scratchpad&quot; document, then, as groupings become more obvious, I add headings, and then, as a section gets longer, I move a block of text to a new document, leaving only the heading and a link in the parent document.
I&#x27;m sure this is a very common way of working, and surely how TheArchive is designed to work.
But what&#x27;s the best way to take a group of paragraphs and a heading, and replace them with concise link?
Right now, I follow these steps. 
It works, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a faster approach built into TheArchive, and what methods work to streamline the creation of child documents. Mine seems to take more steps than I would expect, and the Cut operation makes it a bit precarious. A lot of the time, I miss step 7 and paste the text into the search bar. I also worry that I might make a second Copy operation and lose my cut text.
Is there a way to click on a link and force the creation of a new document, rather than  having to search for a nonexistent document then hit Enter to create it?
Is there a safer way to move a block of text into a new document, rather than cut, change documents, paste?</span>

 I follow the instructions to build HLS binary with support for Template Haskell on here: https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#static-binaries.
 However when I run &#x27;cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install pkg:haskell-language-server&#x27; in terminal, I get the error message:
 cabal: Internal error in target matching. It should always be possible to find
 a syntax that&#x27;s sufficiently qualified to give an unambiguous match. However
 when matching &#x27;pkg:haskell-language-server&#x27; we found haskell-language-server
 (named-package) which does not have an unambiguous syntax. The possible syntax
 and the targets they match are as follows:
 &#x27;haskell-language-server&#x27; which matches haskell-language-server
 (named-package)
 &#x27;pkg:haskell-language-server&#x27; which matches haskell-language-server
 (named-package), pkg:haskell-language-server (unknown-component),
 :pkg:pkg:lib:pkg:file:haskell-language-server (unknown-file)
 &#x27;:pkg:haskell-language-server&#x27; which matches haskell-language-server
 (named-package).
 I don&#x27;t understand this error message, any ideas how I proceed?

                              <span>In Bird&#x27;s book on algorithms in Haskell:
  
3.3 Arrays
 One of the main differences between functional and procedural algorithms is that the former rely on lists as the basic carrier of information while the latter rely on arrays. In functional algorithms input usually consists of a list of values, whereas in procedural algorithms input values are usually assumed to be presented as the elements of an array. For a procedural programmer array updates are destructive: once an array is updated by changing the value at a particular index, the old array is lost. In functional programming, data structures are persistent because any named structure may be referred to at some other point in the computation and therefore has to continue to exist. Consequently, any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array. Because they cannot be changed but only copied, purely functional arrays are known as immutable arrays. It is possible to get round this problem and allow mutable structures by encapsulating the operations in a suitable monad, but we will not introduce monads in this book.
 Wholesale or monolithic updates, on the other hand, are ﬁne. Changing all or some of the entries at one go involves copying the array only once. Haskell provides a number of such wholesale operations in the library Data . Array. The purpose of this section is simply to describe the main functions in this library.
  
What does &quot;wholesale or monolithic update&quot; mean? Does it mean exactly &quot;any update operation, even at a single index, has to be implemented by making a new copy of the whole array&quot;?
 Is a data structure with &quot;wholesale or monolithic update&quot; a mutable or immutable one?
 Does library Data . Array provide mutable or immutable arrays?
 Thanks.

 has anybody integrated one of the emacs-grammarly-packages (e.g. in the form of flychecking) into org-mode? I&#x27;m looking for a setup which allows me to write org-documents and benefit from grammarly-checks.
 Thanks in advance for pointing me to some resources or sharing your configs!

                              <span>The #+macro: system in org-mode is great for text templates etc. However, I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to make it work with multi-line bits of text. Is this possible? If so, how? Are there other workarounds for this kind of capability?
 My use case is that I use org mode for some email templates and I&#x27;ll often want to split the content in the macros over multiple lines (such as when quoting multiple paragraphs etc). 
 Any input is much appreciated; thanks!

  (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/Dropbox/OrgRoam&quot;)) (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-mode-section-functions (list #&#x27;org-roam-backlinks-section #&#x27;org-roam-reflinks-section #&#x27;org-roam-unlinked-references-section )) :bind ( (&quot;C-c n f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c n i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert) (&quot;C-c n l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c n s&quot; . org-roam-db-sync) ;; in case you delete a file outside emacs :map org-mode-map (&quot;C-M-i&quot; . completion-at-point) ) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) ) 
 and describe-variable agrees it is configured
 org-roam-mode-section-functions’s value is (org-roam-backlinks-section org-roam-reflinks-section org-roam-unlinked-references-section) 
 but that section never shows up. To test, I made nodes &quot;Scheme&quot;, &quot;Emacs Lisp&quot;, and &quot;Programming Languages&quot; that explicitly link to each other. I then made another node and wrote sentences including those titles. I tried variations on capitalizations and spacing to see if I misunderstood what would be counted as an unlinked reference. The unlinked references section has never shown up in the roam buffer.
 I saw that it doesn&#x27;t work in windows, but I&#x27;m on mac. I saw several mentions to ripgrep, so I installed it. I tried restarting Emacs a few times, just because. I referenced other people&#x27;s configuration that have this working.
 It feels like I&#x27;m missing something obvious. Do you know what I need to do to get unlinked references to work?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs (pretty much vanilla with a few packages) and whenever I save a file, Emacs automatically changes the indentation.
 For example, if I&#x27;m editing a C++ file like this:
 application icoFoam; startFrom startTime; startTime 0; stopAt endTime; endTime 20; deltaT 0.05; writeControl runTime; 
 Whenever I save it, Doom Emacs changes the format like this:
 application icoFoam; startFrom startTime; startTime 0; stopAt endTime; endTime 20; deltaT 0.05; writeControl runTime; 
 I tried disabling electric-indent-mode, but it did not work.
 Anydoby knows how can I modify this behaviour? I just want to mantain the original format when saving a file.
 Thanks in advance!

 has anybody integrated one of the emacs-grammarly-packages (e.g. in the form of flychecking) into LaTeX-mode? I&#x27;m looking for a setup which allows me to write LaTeX and benefit from grammarly-checks. 
 Thanks in advance for pointing me to some resources or sharing your configs!

The dap-ui-repl doesn&#x27;t do this, here I can execute code directly when a breakpoint is hit, but I do not seem to be able to reach lldb itself. Is there a way to do this in dap-mode?

                              <span>Hi, I want to start experimenting a little bit with Scala. I&#x27;m a Java developer and I&#x27;m using Intellij Idea Ultimate.
 Usually, I use asdf for managing different versions of java, elixir, etc... What is a recommended tool in the Scala world? I see that there is a CLI called coursier. Or should I continue working with asdf? I&#x27;m asking this because it seems to me that coursier gives us the option to install additional tools like scalafmt? 
 Also, should I pick Intellij Idea for Scala 3? Any first-hand experience here - I saw a couple of posts over here, but they are a couple of months old, so I&#x27;m wondering if the situation is better now, or maybe to try with Neovim + native LSP + Metals?
 ​
 To be honest, I expected that tooling will be much more mature for Scala because it is almost mainstream language :)
 ​
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions.

                              <span>Hi Everyone, I am at loss. I am using Scala with SBT and I had to add databricks dependency (link dependencies i get when I install databricks-connect) via unmanagedBase in the build.sbt and now when I try to run the application I get this error. I have tried excluding packages but nothing helps. Maybe I am doing it wrong. Could someone please help me.
 ​
 here is the complete build.sbt in which i tried excluding the org.slf4j. I believe it is due to this dependency having more loggers. I am sorry for the screenshots but whenever i encapsulate the text in code block it gets all messed up when I post it.

Introduction to Free Monads by Nikolay Yakimov
If you’ve been around Haskell circles for a bit, you’ve probably seen the term “free monads”. This article aims to introduce free monads and explain why they are useful.

Email Links
I sometimes start a zettel from an idea sparked by an email. I&#x27;ve struggled with citing the email without importing it into Zotero, my reference manager. I recently stumbled on a solution. Using Applescript and Keyboard Maestro, I can now highlight a mail message, execute the trigger, and voila. A properly formed markdown link is placed in the system copy buffer in the appropriate zettel.
They look in markdown like:
[Listen To Your Listening](message://%3c20210906224833.1.344b41185d81efc9b6af0983@mg2.substack.com%3e)
In preview mode or as exported, they look like:

                              <span>In our last posts, we introduced the general idea of Trustix and its log-based append-only data structure.
In brief, Trustix is a verification system for binary cache providers, and a tool that allows you to compare those software binaries across independent providers to ensure you’re getting the correct software, but without trusting a single binary cache.
In this post we look at the situation where providers disagree on the correct binaries, and how to aggregate those opinions and decide which output to trust.
This problem comes up in many kinds of decentralized systems, and different solutions have arisen for each use-cases.
We’ll discuss some of these solutions and see that, unfortunately, none of them would work for Trustix.
The good news is, the solution Trustix does employ is far si…</span>

                              <span>I am curious about how others decide what is important enough to add to their ZK. When I first started, I added everything and my first attempt was a cluttered mess. Now, I am a lot more selective with what permanent I add, I try and remind myself to just enjoy the process and try and follow the basic practice--capturing the gist of a concept, writing it in my own words, one idea per note, and linking the notes. But, I still feel from time to time as if I am going to end up with another mess full of useless tidbits...
So, my questions are, how do you decide what is important? And, how do you keep from cluttering your ZK?
I know the questions are really broad, but I&#x27;m curious about the thinking behind the decision process.</span>

                              <span>Sönke Ahrens discusses  three descriptive categories of notes in How to Take Smart Notes. The three categories are: fleeting notes, permanent notes and project notes.  The role of the fleeting note in Ahrens&#x27;s account of the Zettelkasten method  is more significant than its name suggests, because of the attitude toward writing that Ahrens wants note takers to adopt. The fleeting note has a normative function in How To Take Smart Notes. Ahrens wants writing to be the reason that note takers do virtually anything. This would be the case if one were to &quot;make writing the only thing that counts.&quot;
First, a capsule summary of the three descriptive categories, with fleeting notes last.
Permanent notes are notes that end up in the Zettelkasten. These have a standard format, and can link to other no…</span>

                              <span>Hi, all!
 Quick description of what&#x27;s going on: I use LSP and am learning Java right now. Am trying lsp-java (which brings dap-java). LSP works fine with the jdtls server. However, when running any flavor of dab-debug in any Java project I get the following:  Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class sol.TestRunner java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Preview features are not enabled for sol/TestRunner (class file version 61.65535). Try running with &#x27;--enable-preview&#x27; 
 I&#x27;ve changed lsp-java-java-path and dap-java-java-command to another version Java and added the &quot;--enable-preview&quot; argument to lsp-java-vmargs and dap-java-args to no avail.
 As far as I can tell everything related to java is updated to the latest version. Any tips for troubleshooting?

                              <span>Greetings,
 I just god Eglot working with Company, but, I was wondering if Eglot has equivalent functionality to LSP-UI, like a popup-menu, documentation, and so forth?
 Or will I need enable some extra company feature to get this type of functionality with Eglot?
 https://github.com/company-mode/company-quickhelp
 ^ This extra company-quickhelp package looks useful, but I want to check if Eglot has it&#x27;s own built-in UI functionality to implement stuff like this?
 Note: I&#x27;m transitioning from lsp-mode/lsp-ui to Eglot, so there&#x27;s a lot I don&#x27;t know and Eglot is still lacking in the documentation area. Eglot itself seems similar to lsp-mode, but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the best way to get lsp-ui like functionality working with Eglot?
 I&#x27;m confused about this, so I figured I&#x27;d ask here.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>I usually switch git branches a lot and have found projectile-find-file or SPC SPC list getting outdated quickly. That&#x27;s why I had to do (setq projectile-enable-caching nil). Have you guys applied any caching setting with which you can keep projectile caching while also ensuring that find file list remains up to date?
 Not sure if it would help, but I&#x27;m using doom emacs.

In particular, I&#x27;d like to have keyword expansion trigger snippet insertion in the buffer. I think this should be possible, but I&#x27;m not seeing the same set of options in my completion popup as I see in vscode, and choosing the function completion only completes the word, rather than filling in a snippet template. Hopefully the images below help to explain the issue.
 I think I&#x27;m using the same language server that vscode uses -- mine is tsserver 0.9.5, from what I can tell vscode uses the same one.
 Any hints? Thanks!

Or another package that is faster? I feel like this shouldn&#x27;t hog performance so much since this feature works flawless in IDEs.
 Edit: One thing to note, it works well when I scroll up the page, but horrendous when scrolling down

 Command &#x27;doom&#x27; not found
 I added ~/.emacs.d to my PATH, nothing changes. 
 I have both a .emacs.d folder and a .doom.d folder in my home directory, am I supposed to have both? I don&#x27;t want to try deleting one just in case it messes things up. 
 I also tried navigating to ~/.emacs.d/bin and tried running doom sync in there, but nothing changes. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 It was until last year that I&#x27;ve switched from &quot;keeping frequently used link targets on top of each Orgdown file&quot; to &quot;using bookmark.el to store and retrieve frequently used headings&quot;.
 Unfortunately, bookmark.el does use bookmark definitions that do often break when the absolute position within an Orgdown file is changed. That happens mostly when I add a substantial number of lines before the bookmark position. When I did get it correctly, this is because its absolute position is changed and the bookmark points to a wrong spot because the context-strings of the definition files can&#x27;t help any more to fix the exact position.
 There are things like bookmark+ which extend the functionality and versatility. I don&#x27;t know if they do use a different and more robust bookmark definition.

 I am trying to do this on my &#x60;org-agenda&#x60;
 [MY PROJECT] ↳ NEXT My next task :my-tag: 
 wherever it finds a sub-tree like this,
 * MY PROJECT :my-tag: ** NEXT My next task 
 However, I want that the text [MY PROJECT] has a distinct face (nano-strong, for example).
 I tried using a propertize, but it does not change the face that I want. 
 This is my best try,
 (defun my/org-agenda-format-breadcrumbs () &quot;&quot; (let ((breadcrumb (org-format-outline-path (cdr (org-get-outline-path))))) (if (string-empty-p breadcrumb) (concat &quot; &quot;) (concat &quot;[&quot; (propertize breadcrumb &#x27;face &#x27;nano-strong) &quot;]\n ↳&quot;)))) (setq org-agenda-prefix-format &#x27;((agenda . &quot; %i %s&quot;) (todo . &quot;%i %-12:c&quot;) (tags . &quot;%(my/org-agenda-format-breadcrumbs)&quot;) (search . &quot;%i %-12:c&quot;))) 
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thanks!

 Because I comes from vim, and was used to :

                              <span>I want to start LSP mode whenever I enter a C/C++ file. When I use the :hook keyword, nothing happens:
 (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :hook (c-mode-common-hook . lsp-deferred)) 
 Even using add-hook in the :config section does nothing
 (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :config (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-common-hook &#x27;lsp-deferred)) 
 But if I add the add-hook outside of use-package, it works
 (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred)) (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-common-hook &#x27;lsp-deferred) 
 My question is: How do you correctly add hooks inside use-package?

For example, to have s-  as execute-extended-command, even when a normal X window is currently focused:  (use-package general :config (general-define-key :prefix &quot;s-SPC&quot; &quot;SPC&quot; &#x27;execute-extended-command ... )  This broke recently, and I&#x27;m not sure what changed. Now pressing s- isn&#x27;t recorded as a keystroke at all. C-h k, then s- also doesn&#x27;t record anything.
 Does anyone have a similar setup or knows how I can debug this further?

                              <span>Just thought I&#x27;d ask...
 I&#x27;ve been doing a bit of coding in the TradeStation &quot;EasyLanguage&quot; in Text Mode and wondering what would be give me more. I&#x27;ve used C-mode with tags which is awesome. Auto indentation, syntax highlighting, ... Oooooooo! 
 I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not up for writing a major mode.
 Here&#x27;s a sample: 
 method void UpdatePlaceOCOButton() variables: OrderTemplateInfo info; begin if IncludeOCO() and AppStorage[OCO_TEMPLATE_KEY] astype string  &quot;&quot; and PlaceOCOButton  NULL and OCOOrderTemplateInfo  NULL then begin info &#x3D; OCOOrderTemplateInfo.Find( AppStorage[OCO_TEMPLATE_KEY] astype string ); PlaceOCOButton.BackColor &#x3D; OCOButtonBackColor; PlaceOCOButton.Text &#x3D; !( &quot;Place OCO Order&quot; ); if info  NULL then begin switch( info.Action ) begin case OrderTemplateAction.exit: if PositionsProvider1.State &#x3D; DataState.loaded then PlaceOCOButton.Enabled &#x3D; PositionsProvider1.Count &gt; 0 else PlaceOCOButton.Enabled &#x3D; false; if PreviewOrdersCheckbox.Checked and OrderPreviewAllowed and PlaceOCOButton.Enabled then begin if LongPositionExists() then PlaceOCOButton.BackColor &#x3D; SellButtonBackColor else PlaceOCOButton.BackColor &#x3D; BuyButtonBackColor; if OCOExitPreviewInProgress &#x3D; false then PlaceOCOButton.Text &#x3D; !( &quot;Preview OCO Order&quot; ); end; case OrderTemplateAction.entry: PlaceOCOButton.Enabled &#x3D; true; default: PlaceOCOButton.Enabled &#x3D; false; end; end else begin PlaceOCOButton.Enabled &#x3D; false; end; end; end;

                              <span>I have a list of type [Integer], called &quot;ints&quot;
 I&#x27;m trying to compute the highest integer, that is less than the first element of &quot;ints&quot; divided by some other number &quot;limit&quot;
 For example, if the first number is 20 and &quot;limit&quot; is 2, then the result should be 9, because it is the greatest integer less than 10. If the first number is 21 and the &quot;limit&quot; is 2, then the result should be the greatest integer less than 2.5, which is 2.
 To compute that, I use this expression:
 ceiling (head ints / 2)
 However, doing this gives me this error:
 &quot;No instance for (RealFrac Integer) arising from a use of &#x27;ceiling.&#x27;&quot;
 &quot;ceiling&quot; expects a RealFrac, and head ints / 2 returns a Fractional.
 My understanding is that I ought to cast &quot;head ints / 2&quot; to a type that GHC knows how to perform the &quot;ceiling&quot; function on.
 What I&#x27;m wondering is, what do I do now?
 As always, thank you in advance for your assistance.

                              <span>So an important part of a lisp is knowing whether any thing is an atom (symbol, number, or empty list).
 However, my parser is being fed a string, so it returns strings. What I need to be able to do is, given a string, determine whether the value it contains can be expressed as an Int, a Double, or just a string, then return the value as that type.
 For example, if my atom function is fed a &quot;3&quot;, it should return 3 as an Int. If it gets a &quot;three&quot;, it should return &quot;three&quot;.
 Is this even possible in haskell? The implementation I&#x27;m working off of is in Python, which is dynamically typed, so it&#x27;s very easy to implement this. However, Python is slow, and I wanted a challenge.

                              <span>Hi, I want to create a binary with everything statically linked, that has the dependencies pandoc and pandoc-types. I&#x27;ve been trying to create a minimum viable example from the stack guide, but am running into issues. I followed this: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/docker_integration/ , as it seems that I should compile on an alpine-linux image since glibc won&#x27;t be statically linked, but musl will. I did the following:
 stack new testproj; cd testproj 
 Add to stack.yaml:
 resolver: lts-18.8 # should correspond with the image specified below docker: enable: true image: &quot;fpco/alpine-haskell-stack:8.10.6&quot; stack run &#x3D;&gt; someFunc # works so far, I guess? I&#x27;m not sure how to confirm that it did indeed use the alpine-haskell-stack image. 
 I now want to add pandoc. In package.yaml:

                              <span>I’ve been learning Haskell for a little bit now and I’ve been slowly understanding functional programming and how to solve problems functionally. I’ve done this mainly by solving problems on exercism.io and reading Learn You A Haskell for Great Good. How can I move on from doing exercises and start doing projects? What are good projects to take on as a beginner Haskeller? I’m only up to the IO section in LYAH so do I need to learn about Monads or something before I can do anything useful? Not really sure what the best path would be. Hoping someone can help me out. Thanks.

                              <span>This post concerns the Akka Streams framework. Has anyone had any experience with Akka Streams and in particular troubleshooting the following MergeHub error below?
 Error in stage [akka.stream.scaladsl.MergeHub$$anon$2$$anon$3]: Upstream producer failed with exception, removing from MergeHub now 
 In general this error indicates that some exception occurred further upstream in the graph, but there&#x27;s no indication of what or where in our logs. In particular I found through step-debugging that some TCP connection was reset, but again there isn&#x27;t enough contextual information to determine where, what or how. It&#x27;s not even clear if the source is production code or framework code.
 I&#x27;m also considering rewriting this without Akka Streams since this is almost impossible to troubleshoot, so I am interested in learning more about alternative frameworks for processing events.

                              <span>I am familiar with programming in Scala and am getting interested in http4s and the Typelevel ecosystem. I know functional programming concepts such as type classes, folds, monads, etc. from programming in Haskell but not sure how to map these onto Scala. What is a good resource for learning about how to use these functional concepts in Scala? I find the docs of the Typelevel libraries to be a bit lacking in explaining what the reasoning is behind design decisions. Ideally something which explains the functional programming theory and then how it gets mapped onto these libraries would be great.

                              <span>At work I use Windows. Today I had a bit of time and checked the existing ob-powershell by rkiggen. It was somewhat incomplete, but was not missing too much. There were also some changes to babel in the meantime, &#x60;org-babel-get-header&#x60; had been removed.
 I guess to make this actually useful (e.g. make it available on melpa) it would need some packaging.

                              <span>I know we can always use a Java one, but it would be nice if there was a native scala adaption. 
 I’ve notice in my place of employment there is even a rule that we’re not allowed to use IOC Containers for dependency management because it’s not the “functional way”
 Is this a common mentality? There are always parts of a large enterprise code base where being strictly functional is impractical in my opinion, hence why scala enables object oriented solutions in these cases. 
 Is this sentiment wide spread? Is that why no one has adapted a Java IOC framework for Scala natively (or implemented their own)?

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell
 instance (HasTrie (f b), HasTrie a) &#x3D;&gt; HasTrie (FreeF f a b) where
 newtype (FreeF f a b :-&gt;: c) &#x3D; FreeFTrie (Either (f b) a :-&gt;: c)
 trie f &#x3D; FreeFTrie (trie (f . either Free Pure))
 untrie (FreeFTrie f) &#x3D; untrie f . (\case Free x -&gt; Left x; Pure y -&gt; Right y)
 instance (forall a. HasTrie a &#x3D;&gt; HasTrie (f a)) &#x3D;&gt; HasTrie (FreeT f [] Void) where
 newtype (FreeT f [] Void :-&gt;: b) &#x3D; FreeTrie ([FreeF f Void (FreeT f [] Void)] :-&gt;: b)
 trie f &#x3D; FreeTrie (trie (f . FreeT))
 untrie (FreeTrie f) &#x3D; untrie f . runFreeT
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 but in the process I started to wonder if generics could derive this, maybe using representable-tries, or if there was some other advantage to be gleaned from that library.

                              <span>Currently learning Haskell for school, and I’m attempting to follow along with provided video tutorials, and things don’t seem to work as shown. The biggest thing is that running “:r” doesn’t recompile (not sure if that’s the best word) as it does in the tutorials. I always have to open a new terminal and go from there. Am I just missing something crucial, or is VSCode just not great for Haskell? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>We have a stack project that uses an external C library.
 AFAIK, on M1 chips, stack installs an x86_64 GHC which means I always get x86_64 Haskell programs.
 This is usually not a problem, Rosetta takes care of it.
 But if I now want to link the arm64 C library, I get linking errors.
 Has someone had similar experiences and if so, how did you solve it?

                              <span>Hello! Is there a list of all the different concepts to learn, required or recommended, to understand Haskell code? My guess is that we can do a lot, including using most libraries, knowing &quot;only&quot;:
 ​
  
basic Haskell syntax (functions, lambdas, pattern matching, guards, case, where, let)
 data types (sum, product, algebraic, recursive, polymorphic, records, type synonyms)
 type classes
 referential transparency, high order functions, function composition, currying
 laziness, memoization, tail recursion elimination, strictness, inlining
 module (import and export)
 some actual types (Bool, Text, Int, Float, String) and data structures (List, Maybe, Either)
 some type classes (Ord, Eq, Num, Show, Read, Functor, Applicative, Alternative, Monad, IO, Foldable, Semigroup, Monoid)
 some functions (map, fold, sort, head-tail-init-last, scan, zip, and a few other functions for list manipulation)
 monad transformers
  
​
 What do you think? What&#x27;s missing?
 ​
 There are so much more, it&#x27;s overwhelming. Let&#x27;s see, just from the top of my head:
  
tagless final
 phantom type
 generalized algebraic data types
 arrows
 free monads
 comonads
 lenses (btw, 109 operators in the module… it&#x27;s never enough apparently)
 continuations
  
And I guess I&#x27;ve only scratch the surface here. I didn&#x27;t even talked much about the different modules since I don&#x27;t know them yet. It&#x27;s been months that I learn Haskell, and each time I learn something, I find another concept. I didn&#x27;t even take the time to read modules doing actual stuff. What&#x27;s the minimum to be comfortable writing efficient, idiomatic code?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m very new to MacOS and emacs. I&#x27;m working through the standard emacs tutorial. In fact, I&#x27;ve been practicing the tutorial from the start each day for about 5 days now. C-a used to work just fine, but now, it doesn&#x27;t even seem to send a key. So for example:
 C-h c C-a
 The C-h c command doesn&#x27;t respond with anything. It doesn&#x27;t know that I typed C-a. All other basic commands that I tried does work.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I finally fixed the issue where Eglot was dying, so now when I open a Python file Eglot activates fine. But, now my issue has to do with company backends.
 Here&#x27;s the error:
 File mode specification error: (void-variable company-backends)
 And here&#x27;s my config:
 ;;-------------------------------------------------
 (use-package company
 :defer t
 :config
 (setq company-backends
 &#x27;((company-files :with company-yasnippet)
 (company-capf :with company-yasnippet)
 (company-dabbrev-code company-gtags company-etags company-keywords :with company-yasnippet)
 (company-dabbrev :with company-yasnippet)))
 (setq lsp-completion-provider :none)
 (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook
 &#x27;(lambda ()
 (set (make-local-variable &#x27;company-backends)
 &#x27;(company-python))))
 )

                              <span>I try to migrate my ~/.authinfo file into pass manager and I know that auth-source-pass is now part of Emacs but I cannot successfully connect to my gmail (or any other mail) account in Gnus. I tried various syntax of my pass entries in my manager but during starting Gnus I still receive warning about failed connection.
 My pass tree in different ways:
 .password-store/ │ └─ gmail ├── @gmail.com.gpg ├── imap.gmail.com │ └── .gpg └── smtp.gmail.com └── .gpg 
 Is it adding port necessary? I saw this post but it doesn&#x27;t provide to me complex answer. I am not gnus hacker so I tried to setup Gnus according to wiki.

 I&#x27;m having issues getting Eglot working with python-lsp-server in regular Emacs.
 Anyways, others recommended that I try some Emacs Distros like Doom and Spacemacs, because things like language servers work out-of-the-box.
 So which Emacs Distros would you recommend for this use-case?

                              <span>I run emacs at work on a system that does not access the internet, so I cannot utilize the package interface that pulls directly from melpa (and elpa etc). Years ago, someone copied a version of melpa into a local directory on the air-gapped server. In my init.el, I setq package-archive to something like ((&quot;local-melpa&quot; . &quot;/path/to/the/melpa/dir&quot;)) so that it points to this local directory. I&#x27;m wondering if there is a tool to facilitate this sort of mirroring? I would like to update my packages on this air-gapped network. I am able to copy files onto the system from a less restricted workstation with internet access. Is it just a matter of unzipping the melpa repo and pointing package-archive to the fresh melpa directory?

                              <span>Greetings,
 Quick question,
 What is the correct way to add python-mode to company-backends, so that Eglot can find python-lsp-server?
 Note: I&#x27;m using use-package.
 Also, when Eglot attempts to load python-lsp-server, a module pkgs_resources error is thrown?
 I&#x27;m not sure if this has to do with the company-backends issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help

So I was wondering if I could move these folders/files to somewhere else (I use arch, btw). I have tried to find this information elsewhere, but I can&#x27;t seem to locate it. 
 Thx

 Has this changed by now?

 Well after deciding to go back to doom I once again deleted .emacs.d reinstalled and doom. However when I launch emacs I&#x27;m not getting doom just default emacs with the theme I set. 
 What gives?

 I&#x27;ve setup zone-mode to trigger after some minutes adding 
 (require &#x27;zone) (zone-when-idle 120) 
 to the init file, and it works sweetly to obscure the text and prevent casual snooping... most of the time. Some of the zone modes are quite readable, or very slow to become obfuscated. Is there a way I can setup zone so that it&#x27;ll always run the same program (for instance, zone-pgm-jitter) or, even betterm, a list of programs I choose?
 I&#x27;ve googled around but I didn&#x27;t find any pointers to that.

                              <span>I have a 35Mb csv file. Opening it takes too much time in Doom Emacs, while in vanilla Emacs it is opened instantly.
 I ran profiler and presumably it is related to the vertico--advice, but I&#x27;m not an expert in profiler. Does anyone knows how to debug this behavior or maybe there is some built-in mode which is turned on in Doom by default, or there might be some setting which I need to turn on/off for large files?

                              <span>Is it in any way doable to vary the margin width (as I believe this is how packages like olivetti-mode actually accomplish centering of buffets) for only certain parts of the buffer? The main use cases I was thinking of are purely aesthetic: 
  
a banner image on top of centered text in a buffer (a la certain Notion notes like this), which I thought (in my limited elisp experience) might be achievable via (put-image) and somehow not centering only the first line of the buffer.
 centering quotes or LaTeX align blocks inside Org documents
  
I&#x27;m curious as to whether this is even possible, although I&#x27;m entirely open to any other ways of trying to implement this that don&#x27;t involve varying margin lengths throughout a buffer.

 I want to get rid of the prompt, but I don&#x27;t know where it comes from. And it&#x27;s also hard to figure it out. Every time I restart Emacs and start typing, I don&#x27;t see it. It only shows itself after I use Emacs for a while.
 Does anyone know how to get rid of it? By the way, I&#x27;m using macOS. I suspect it has something to do with macOS because I didn&#x27;t see it when I used Linux before.

 Eglot is unable to find &#x60;python-lsp-server&#x60; binary PATH. So does Eglot have this equivalent functionality to lsp-mode?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am a new user of Emacs (Following system crafters stuff no less). I am trying to use Emacs for writing fantasy books / Novels. However all the information ive seen has been so disparate that I cant find anything good on how to actually do it.
 ​
 I know ORG-mode is the go to mode for this but I haven&#x27;t seen much on how to actually convert said mode into epub or mobi or etc. So far Ive only really read ramblings on what you &quot;could&quot; do and not how to do it.
 ​
 Does anyone have any specific website I may be able to look at? Am honestly unsure which subreddit this is supposed to be under
 ​
 Tl:dr Assistance on how to use emacs to actually write with. My eyes are going blind from googlefu.
 ​
 Post post - Compiled list of stuff:
 One can use Pandoc to convert from Org to Markdown and then fix that towards a good pandoc for E-books (no information on how to do that well on this thread nor is it emacs specific)
 https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc can be useful for going org to other associated
 Using Org and Latex is another way (most likely the best for conversion)

                              <span>Hello,
 Right now, I have a config file to display my Exams,
 https://i.imgur.com/UpS58M1.jpg
 (setq org-todo-keywords
 &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO&quot; &quot;EXAM&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE&quot; &quot;CANCELLED&quot;)))
 ​
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
 &#x27;((&quot;c&quot; &quot;Show IST EXAMs &quot;
 ((todo &quot;EXAM&quot;)
 (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 31)))))))
 ​
 I would like to have the first part of buffer (ie. Global List of TODO items of type EXAM), sorted by timestamp/schedule.
 And displaying each date accordingly.
 I have tried to change the columns variable, but the result I got was a row on the top, without altering the rest of the buffer.
 ​
 BTW, what is the difference between just adding a timestamp, and adding a SCHEDULED ?
 I have read the org docs about this difference but I do not understand it...
 ​
 Thanks in advance.
 Sorry for my poor English.

 data MessageType &#x3D; Info
 | Warning
 | Error Int
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 type TimeStamp &#x3D; Int
 data LogMessage &#x3D; LogMessage MessageType TimeStamp String
 | Unknown String
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 data MessageTree &#x3D; Leaf
 | Node MessageTree LogMessage MessageTree
 deriving (Show, Eq)
 I need to know how to access a property of these types - for example, the MessageType of a LogMessage. How would I do that? Is this even possible?

 Briefly speaking, I have a Person data type that contains fields &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Age.&quot;
 However, I should have clarified something: The .txt that I import actually looks more like this:
 Brian Campbell 31
 Johannes Diderik van der Waals 31
 Very rarely, if ever, do I have a name with only one part.

Why do people prefer to use Haskell over other languages compared to others in the same sphere of programming languages? Why do people prefer to use Haskell and for what tasks? How useful are the libraries made for Haskell and how well made is the language underneath?

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning FP at the moment from the perspective of category theory and trying to understand what makes FP so special.
 I understand the imperative languages require explicit &quot;control flow&quot;, which is &quot;the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.&quot; (wiki)
 However, the central axiom of category theory is compositionality of morphisms, but then more subtly the associativity of composition. In other words, order doesn&#x27;t matter. You can compose all these functions without worrying about which order they need to be glued together.
 Is that what makes FP so special?

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to announce cleff, a new extensible effects library for Haskell: https://github.com/re-xyr/cleff.
 These are some key features of this library:
  
It has an API similar to polysemy and freer-simple, i.e. you can write effect interpreters as simple case-splitting functions. This means effects are low-boilerplate, easy to understand, and that users of similar libraries can easily get along with cleff.
 It supports higher-order effects implementation, and provides a set of easy-to-use combinators for that. The expressiveness of these combinators are on par with polysemy&#x27;s Tactics language, and also harder to use incorrectly.
 It uses a ReaderT IO monad as the underlying Eff monad implementation, instead of free monads. 
 Therefore, the overhead of effects is reduced greatly (and gives pretty impressive microbenchmark results).
 IO-based effect implementations provides good interaction with exceptions and concurrency (no more losing changes to State due to exceptions).
 
  
The library and documentation are already available on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cleff.

In my current setup, I have an easy way of getting the path to any PDF associated with my an entry in my main .bib file. If I could modify the metadata of a PDF, I might be able to then use the information in the BibTeX entry to update the metadata of the associated PDF. 
 Is there some way of modifying the metadata of a PDF from within Emacs? I keep searching online but most results I find are about attempts to extract information from the metadata in a PDF.

 I was just wondering if there&#x27;s any official documentation on getting language servers working with Eglot, like how lsp-mode has it&#x27;s own documentation?
 I&#x27;m having trouble getting python-lsp-server working with Eglot, so having some good documentation to reference would be nice.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using these two amazing packages for my completion set-up. Here&#x27;s my config for them:
 (setq corfu-auto t corfu-quit-no-match t corfu-quit-at-boundary t) (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless) completion-category-defaults nil orderless-component-separator &quot;*&quot;) (add-hook &#x27;minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda () (setq-local orderless-component-separator &quot; &quot;))) 
 Basically this means that for in-buffer completion, the * character is used as separator for substrings, and for minibuffer completion this character is SPC instead.
 I really cannot understand how anyone would keep corfu-quit-at-boundry to nil, plus SPC as the default component separator. Writing code like this is hell, every time I press space after defining a new variable, corfu keeps searching for an existing variable instead.
 The problem with my configuration is that * is sometimes (e.g. in php-mode) seen as a non-word character and therefore completion stops after inputting it. Is there a way to add * to the character list considered to be a word? For example, this setup does work in shell-mode.
 Thanks a lot in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve found a great way to get the best of all three of theses modes in emacs, I&#x27;m just not too sure what the &quot;engines&quot; are in web-mode. It says svelte is one of them, but the documentation doesn&#x27;t include svelte. I think this is the correct way, but if anyone knows better please let me know. Basically I&#x27;m just worried I&#x27;m miss using or configuring something. 
  ;; svelte support (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (setq web-mode-engines-alist &#x27;((&quot;svelte&quot; . &quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot;)))

                              <span>I try to install Microsoft’s python-language-server on NixOS, and integrate it with emacs, following https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-python-ms.
 I have installed Microsoft’s python-language-server on NixOS, by adding python-language-server to configuration.nix.
 Then I try to integrate it into Emacs. I copy the following into ~/.emacs.d/init.el:
 ;; Include lsp-python-ms in the configuration file: (require &#x27;lsp-python-ms) (setq lsp-python-ms-auto-install-server t) (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp) ; or lsp-deferred ;; initialization (use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (require &#x27;lsp-python-ms) (lsp))) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find &quot;python-language-server&quot;))) 
 (1) I don&#x27;t want to restart emacs for reloading the above added code in ~/.emacs.d/init.el, because I don&#x27;t want to kill the programs run from a shell inside emacs. Can I select the above added code region , and hit C-x C-e? 
 (2) When I did that, I saw in the Backtrace buffer:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function use-package) (use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode lambda nil (require &#x27;lsp-python-ms) (lsp)) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find &quot;python-language-server&quot;))) eval((use-package lsp-python-ms :ensure t :hook (python-mode lambda nil (require &#x27;lsp-python-ms) (lsp)) :init (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find &quot;python-language-server&quot;))) nil) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) call-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 I was wondering if there is something wrong by Debugger entered--Lisp error? How shall I make the lsp work in emacs?
 Thanks.

                              <span>After restarting Emacs, company-mode doesn&#x27;t provide completions until I restart it.
 I have global-company-mode set to t in my init.el file. 
 After restarting, if I run M-x global-company-mode the minibuffer responds &quot;global company mode disabled&quot; 
 Then when I run M-x global-company-mode again the minibuffer responds &quot;global company mode enabled&quot; which seems to indicate global-company-mode is enabled when I restart Emacs, but it just doesn&#x27;t give completions. 
 Once company-mode is restarted, then it runs exactly as expected.
 This isn&#x27;t a big deal because I don&#x27;t restart Emacs that often, but it&#x27;s annoying, and I can&#x27;t figure out what is wrong. 
 Any suggestions?
 Below are the relevant parts of my init.el file. The entire file can be found here.
 Edit: This is fixed now.
 (use-package company :ensure t :bind (:map company-active-map (&quot;C-n&quot; . company-select-next) (&quot;C-p&quot; . company-select-previous)) :config (setq company-show-quick-access &#x27;left) (setq company-backends &#x27;((company-capf company-dabbrev-code))) (setq company-tooltip-flip-when-above t) :custom ;;use M-[asdfg] keys for quick completions (company-quick-access-keys &#x27;(&quot;a&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot;)) (company-quick-access-modifier &#x27;meta) :custom-face ;; set the face manually to fixed-width (company-tooltip ((t (:family &quot;Source Code Pro&quot;)))) :hook (prog-mode . company-mode))

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to embrace the literate programming lifestyle for everything, especially for my dotfiles. So far, I have successfully managed to convert all my configuration files and custom shell scripts into Org files that tangle into the proper file formats, but I have been unsuccessful in doing so for my custom snippets. I have several snippets meant for Org-mode, an example being a file with its content being the following:
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC 
 The snippet will create a source block that will tangle its contents into &#x60;user-config.el&#x27;. The problem with this is that I cannot get such a file out just by doing what I normally do to tangle files. I tried the following:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle test.sh # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 #+END_SRC #+end_src 
 I tried to distinguish the real source block from the one that I wish to be exported literally by using indents and different capitalisation but the file I get by tangling this is
  # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: user-config # key: uc # -- #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle user-config.el $1 
 It clearly cuts off at the first #+END_SRC block. It&#x27;s not a crippling issue but seeing how I have a whole directory of non-Org files in a repository of only Org files is quite uncomfortable. Does anybody have an idea how I can go about this awkward limitation?

                              <span>Is it possible to indent a paragraph of text WITHOUT making it into a code block?
I know TheArchive uses Markdown, which treats indented text as a code block. But I would like to indent paragraphs to show a hierarchy of ideas. Paragraphs often contain tags (either web links or TheArchive&#x27;s own bracketed links), and if the paragraph is indented, the links stop being active. (As a writer, code blocks have very little use to me.)
Is there a way of turning off the default &quot;code block&quot; formatting when indenting a paragraph with tabs?

                              <span>Hello Zettelkasten friends,
I&#x27;ve made a few packages for working with my archive in Emacs, and thought you might like to take a look.
The general package, &quot;zk,&quot; is a basic set of functions for working with notes -- creating new notes, creating links, finding backlinks, renaming, searching, etc. It uses only built-in features of Emacs --- so no external dependencies. And it can be extended and modified in all the ways that Emacs can be extended and modified. My thought is that it could provide a baseline for people to fork and craft a set of functions to their own liking.
It just became available on Melpa and you can see a demonstration here: https://youtu.be/BixlUK4QTNk
The other package is called &quot;zk-index,&quot; offers two additional interfaces for browsing your notes.
The &quot;ZK-Index&quot; interface is a persistent listing of notes, in a dedicated buffer, that can be sorted (by date of modification or creation) and narrowed down by title or note contents.
The other interface, called &quot;ZK-Desktop&quot; (included in &quot;zk-index&quot;), offers a way of working with smaller selections of notes, for specific projects for example. You can select notes from the index to &quot;send to the desktop,&quot; where you can arrange them however you want, add commentary about the arrangements, etc. Like working with notecards on a desktop.
You can see a demontration of the index and desktop features here: https://youtu.be/7qNT87dphiA


Note that &quot;zk-index&quot; is still a work in progress, so it&#x27;s only available in the dev branch of the zk repository. But it&#x27;s been working for me, so if you give it a shot and have some notes, please let me know, either here or in Github Issues!
On compatibility, &quot;zk&quot; is fairly configurable, so it should be able to work with your current archive, maybe with a little configuring. I started my own note-taking using &quot;The Archive,&quot; and the format of my notes and hasn&#x27;t changed at all, so these packages should (I hope!) work with your existing archive.
Let me know what you think!</span>

What is Luck?
[[202110172020]] 
#Luck    #Determination    #Preparation
I’ve heard luck defined as simply being well prepared (through hard work of various types) when opportunity comes knocking. I like and believe that definition, particularly because it removes luck from the realm of the mystical.
So then, you might ask, isn’t it just luck when opportunity comes along?  The simple fact is that opportunities always come along. One just needs to be prepared, then patient and persistent (even tenacious), and finally discerning to recognize the right opportunity.  So, you see, luck isn’t the first step nor is it the driving force - it’s rather t…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m surprised to see that many senior developers for the Scala community use VS code with Metals. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now I found its far from what Intellij Idea offers as of now. So many things won&#x27;t work in VS code especially with Scala 3 for example,
  
Metals frequently hangs and so is the compilation, run button on test classes disappears etc. 
 Cannot evaluate any expression in debug mode (see here), this is an extremely important feature I use in Idea (especially given that Scala has a very compact syntax structure)
 Autocomplete won&#x27;t work for Scala 3
 No shortcuts for creating Test class stub from the main class (Intellij idea does it quite nicely, even creating necessary packages under &#x27;test&#x27; directory) 
 No option to run test cases at an individual level (currently only at a class level its supported)
  
etc. 
 If all issues like above gets fixed then I guess the VS Code would rock

 Any tips on how to fix this error?

                              <span>I use emacs for everything from taking notes, OS level tasks like organizing the file system and calculating dinner costs, to programming in a variety of languages. Ido mode helps me in opening files and switching buffers without having to remember the exact filenames. I also use tab bar mode that rolled out with emacs 27 to quickly assess which files are open in a glance. For switching between tabs, I use the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command. While it works well, sometimes I do not remember the exact filename(or the case specific name). It breaks the flow of my thoughts when I have to think about the exact filename. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for an ido mode equivalent for the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command.
 I am happy with the tab bar mode and I do not want to start using other packages just for this additional functionality. Is there any way to customize the tab-bar-switch-to-tab command to have an ido like completion? If not, is it something that can be implemented and how could I go about implementing that - asking for pointers to start with.

 i have the macro provided, i would do this to create the function

 the function test-function should be interactive and whenever called it should prompt me for 
 arg1, arg2, and arg3
 what i have tried:
 (defmacro test-macro (name args) &#x60;(progn (defun ,name ,args (interactive (list ,(let ((count 0) (lst ())) (while (&lt; count (length args)) (push &#x60;(read-string ,(concat (symbol-name (nth count args)) &quot;: &quot;)) lst) (setq count (+ count 1))) lst))) ))) 
 everything works fine but the part of (read-string) results in invalid-function error

I downloaded Programming with elisp book, but I found it very hard to follow along because since I&#x27;m new to emacs I couldn&#x27;t manage to run a standalone elisp script in emacs. 
 Basically I created a new .el file but fly check gives me a lot of errors like I need to add a bunch of comments to the start of the file. I don&#x27;t remember what they were but adding them didn&#x27;t fix anything.
 So I&#x27;m wondering is there an easy way to get started with elisp programming in emacs?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m a writer who lives in Germany (12 published novels with Random House), and I started using emacs a year ago and am falling in love more and more. It is perfect for organizing material for my novels, and I even use Mu4e for e-mails by now.
 I would be happy to try to write my next novel with emacs. But there is one thing that just drives me crazy writing prose in emacs, and I wonder whether there is a solution to it. (Olivetti Mode or Writeroom mode do not solve this, regrettably.)
 When writing prose, I don&#x27;t want to have a blank line between each paragraph, but to have them indented instead. It just looks awkard to me, to have lines of dialogue like this:
 &quot;I met another woman&quot;, he said.
 .
 &quot;Who is it?&quot;
 .
 &quot;You don&#x27;t know her.&quot;
 .
 She gave him a furious stare.
 ​
 ​
 It reather should look like this:
 ​
 &quot;I met another woman&quot;, he said.
 ..... &quot;Who is it?&quot;
 ..... &quot;You don&#x27;t know her.&quot;
 ..... She gave him a furious stare.
 ​
 (Reddit deletes blank space, I had to put dots there.)
 But the indentation shouldn&#x27;t be Tabs or Spaces, it should just be how emacs displays the buffer.
 Is there a way to make this possible, a way to write prose without blank lines between the paragraphs and to have the first line of each paragraph indented?
 Formatted text properties like &quot;indent more&quot; insert spaces. Maybe this is the way emacs is made, and there is no way to just visually indent (like in a word processor) without putting characters in the document.
 Thank you so much for any help on this!
 Titus

 I found this often the case with doc-strings, where conventions such as #123 to reference a bug-report or tags such as FIX, TODO, etc ... make sense to highlight in documentation, but not in regular strings, where only minimal highlighting is useful (escape characters for e.g.).
 The package also has presets for C/Python &amp; Lua (opt-in), so you can have highlighting for Python&#x27;s escape sequences without having to come up with the regex for this yourself.

                              <span>Hi,
 do you have any working config with the angular-language-server with the html file ?
 I can use it if I have a typescript file and the intellisense + flycheck is working well.
 But it isn&#x27;t working with the angular in the html file.
 I use web-mode and I start the lsp as well.
 I reconfigure the lsp-clients-angular-language-server-command and it use same as the vscode do.

                              <span>It appears that ppl. nowadays are putting everything into an org-mode tangle config. But even this it seems gets very long and cumbersome to maintain.
 I&#x27;m curious whether there are there any other tips/tricks that people use to reduce the mental load of carrying a custom config. Is the answer just simplification &amp; reduction of the files? a custom org scheme? sticking to popular, maintained, high bus factor projects?
 Does anyone have a .emacs they havent had to touch or even think about for long periods of time?.. &amp; are not completely bewildered when they come back to it (like i am when I pulled up my old college .emacs)? Curious to hear any suggestions/audacious tales/horror stories.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;m using emmet-mode for web development in Emacs which is going good, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to add these 2 pieces of functionality:
  
drop-down-menu-list(I already have yasnippet and hippie-expand enabled and combined with my emmet-mode config), But, I have no idea why a drop down menu is not appearing when I start typing while emmet-mode is enabled?
 For example, when I type: html and then press the ctrl-j keybinding, it automatically creates an opening and closing tag and inserts the the cursor between the tag, but most of the time, after doing this I press: Enter to move the closing tag to the next line, then I manually move the cursor at the end of the opening tag and press: Enter again, which creates a gap in-between the closing and opening tag and automatically places the cursor in the gap, correctly indented. So I was wondering if there&#x27;s a way that I could add this extra functionality to automate this for me, that way I just have to type the name of the tag like: html, then press Enter on an emmet code snippet in the drop-down-menu-list, which will then create the tags, but with the ending tag 2 lines below the starting tag with the cursor indented in between the gap. I hope that I explained this well enough.
 Functionality to be able and press tab to move the cursor between things like tags and strings in html.
  
Example:
  
type: html
 choose emmet snippet from drop-down-menu-list
 automatically expands like this:
  
 
 | (indented cursor automatically placed in-between opening and closing tags)
 
 
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having this problem for a while, Whenever I browse any folder in vscode, including non-scala projects, metals decides to create a .metals folder out of nowhere.
 On top of that I think it&#x27;s got an active background process running or something, because I can&#x27;t delete the folder which vscode is open in it&#x27;s parent.
 I&#x27;m just learning scala, but I&#x27;m not ALWAYS working in scala, so it&#x27;s been bothering me so much I just disable the extension, but then it&#x27;s such a pain whenever I want to use scala.
 ​
 TLDR: Is there any way to disable the auto import? I prefer to do it manually.

                              <span>I am a Java guy and making the arduous trek into Haskell for the purposes of expanding my general knowledge and for Cardano development. I have been going through some material and documentation recommended on the Haskell site. Any good video lecture courses out there that are digestible y’all would recommend? I noticed the FP and AFP courses on YouTube have been made private 😕 which is unfortunate.

                              <span>I really like elfeed, it&#x27;s really convenient to use one program to read news and feeds and save them in org files. But! I faced with this problem.
 When I read reddit, the text gets very narrow, and it&#x27;s very annoying when reading this kind of content.
 (The picture below is me reading this subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Popular_Science_Ru.rss).
 I did not make any special settings for elfeed.

 Perhaps someone has encountered something like this?

                              <span>Greetings, I’m looking for a good App for knowledge management. I’ve seen many tutorials of Org-Mode and Emacs, and maybe it worths a try.
 But because I work with many academic researches, I collect lots of PDFs and I need to find text inside of them.
 Is it possible with Mode and Emacs? How?
 Thank you!

                              <span>My need is simple. I want to be able to read and reply to google mails in Emacs. I&#x27;m trying to build emacs 29 now. So my first question is:
 1. Should I use --with-mailutils while building emacs (Or not) for that ?
 I raised this query on IRC emacs and many people mentioned it&#x27;s not required, but didn&#x27;t explain clearly why. If it&#x27;s not required, and If I can setup a client by just adding some mail handling packages later on, then,
 2. I&#x27;m wondering what is the use of --with-mailutils, while building ?
 Now that&#x27;s not the only confusion. I&#x27;ve went through the MailUtils page (assuming that&#x27;s what emacs will be building, if I specify the option). It mentions that it provides rich set of utilities for mail handling, so why would anyone say not to use it. Does it make Emacs bulky or anything. Idk. I&#x27;m just assuming (since they said no). Can anyone please explain me these things to clear the confusion.

                              <span>Greetings,
 In Emacs I&#x27;m using Eglot as a language server, and it now supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript really well. The only thing that I&#x27;m missing, is how to setup Emmet in Emacs to work alongside Eglot. Having nice scripts will make it easier for me, like when writing HTML templates.
 Attached below is my config passed to VSCode&#x27;s settings.json file(different syntax but close):
 &#x60;
 userSettings &#x3D;
 {
 &quot;emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab&quot; &#x3D; true;
 &quot;emmet.showSuggestionsAsSnippets&quot; &#x3D; true;
 &quot;emmet.showExpandedAbbreviation&quot; &#x3D; &quot;always&quot;;
 &quot;editor.snippetSuggestions&quot; &#x3D; &quot;top&quot;;
 &quot;files.associations&quot; &#x3D;
 {
 &quot;*html&quot; &#x3D; &quot;html&quot;;
 };
 &quot;emmet.includeLanguages&quot; &#x3D; 
 {
 &quot;javascript&quot; &#x3D; &quot;html&quot;;
 &quot;django-html&quot; &#x3D; &quot;html&quot;;
 };
 };
 &#x60;
 So what Emacs packages and use-package/ELisp configurations will I need to get this equivalent Emmet functionality in Emacs.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>Hello there, I have Python setup with EIN in Emacs, which I&#x27;m very happy with. But, I&#x27;d like to add IDE like features to this setup. EIN&#x27;s documentation says Elpy is fully supported, but I&#x27;m not sure how to set it up with my Python/EIN setup?
 If you could paste a link to good documentation specific to this, or paste some snippets below, I use the emacs package use-package, so I understand that the most.
 Note: I searched this online, but I can&#x27;t find specific documentation on setting up Elpy to work with Python/EIN, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking here.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 I write Clojure and common Lisp and have been feeling tired to type parens by shift+8 all the time. Is there any easier way to type it? It&#x27;d be even better to be able to just use one key so I&#x27;m not sure if it is possible. Please enlighten me if you have any clue.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use lsp-ltex, but I&#x27;m getting stuck on some pretty basic things.
  
It can&#x27;t seem to update the language server past 14.0.0, even though 15.2.0 is the newest version
 It won&#x27;t ignore words from a dictionary file, even when I put it in the .vscode directory that the ltex-ls docs indicate it looks for automatically
 It won&#x27;t add words to the dictionary, even with the &quot;add words&quot; code action.
  
Has anyone got their emacs.d file where they&#x27;ve got lsp-ltex configured with any/all of these solved? Or is it just not really ready to be used?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all! I am learning Haskell and this is my first program. I was wondering if anyone could provide some feedback on what I could improve on it. Thank you!!
 Some notes:
  
Link to repo
 main logic for checking if a candidate word matches a previous guess-and-colors
 some tests for the main logic
 Colors are specified with numebrs: 
 Green: 2
 Yellow: 1
 Black: 0
 
  
Updates (chronological):
  
I learned about hlint and fixed the warnings, thanks to u/sunnyata
 I&#x27;m going through the commits in a PR by and thanks to Zij-IT
 Merged the first PR (using foldl, foldr and zip), thanks to Zij-IT
 Enabled Github actions to run the tests on push!
 In progress: Next I will be trying to define a custom union type instead of Char, as inspired by u/r3dnaz&#x27;s comments. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

 The code that I have written:

                              <span>I as a beginner am so used to simply doing deriving and getting an automatic default Enum, Eq, and Ord that I don&#x27;t really know how to create instances of these by hand. For example, if I have 
 data MyColor &#x3D; MyRed | MyGreen | MyBlue deriving Show 
 and I only allow myself Show, what would the code for the instances for Enum, Eq, and Ord look like? Especially the superclass constraint situation, i.e., how do they &quot;nest?&quot; So how does Haskell automatically figure out these instances when using the default deriving trick?

 Is GitHub still using semantic it to power some code navigation features?
 Has it been abandoned or is there some successor project that has taken its place?
 Is there any writeup / lessons learned about this project?

                              <span>Are we limited to something like long long, or unsigned long long, or can a BigInt in theory be as big as I want, given that there is a string-based constructor for that. Can I have a BigInt with 300 or 3000 digits?
 The mathematical operations on them as separate methods, do in principle it should be possible to have numbers of arbitrary length and infinite precision, as Mathematica has it.
 In Mathematica an integer can have a million digits. That would be hard to scroll, so say 10 thousand or 100 thousand digits. Would that be possible in Scala or Java with BigInt or BigInteger?

 When publishing a library to a central location do you publish a fat JAR including your dependencies or just the JAR of your source code?
 If just the source code, when someone integrates the library into their sbt project, does sbt automatically download/resolve the library&#x27;s dependencies or do you need to do something else to make this happen?
 In python you have a setup.py file where you specify your library dependencies that pip will install with your source code with the &quot;depends_on&quot; parameter when pip installs your library.

                              <span>Hi, I recently decided to go back to FP / Akka Scala (I&#x27;ve been absent in the space since 2019, still programming in Scala but more on OOP side). I have a lot of experience recently in distributed computing using Spark or Flink and I really like how these frameworks solve many issues that could go wrong in reality (offering automatic node failure recovery, effectively-once semantics etc).
 I started exploring ZIO and Akka Streams lately and I feel like there would be a lot of burden to run distributed computation using either of those. Especially to solve the issues I mentioned earlier. For me both of these focus mostly on single-node applications that would not scale in reality. I see that by the use of Fibers I can achieve high resource utilization on a single node. I can imagine buildin…</span>

                              <span>is there a great resource, book or library‍ on classic Algorithms and Data Structures in Scala, e.g. similar in scope and quality to Sedgewick Algorithms in Java https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/ I found a very helpful section on algorithms implementation in /u/lihaoyi superb Hand-On Scala Programming book , but unfortunately it&#x27;s only a few pages (p.107-121). And most other books provide algorithms just an illustration for some neat language feature. The thing is, to get a job as Scala developer these days (in competitive firms) one needs to be a competitive programmer, master of Leetcode, and Scala doesn&#x27;t seem to have strong ecosystem in that regard as Java, Python or C++. Edit: in DIY spirit and as a learning exercise i&#x27;m thinking of translating Sedgewick Algorithms from Java to idiomatic functional Scala, if anyone wants to join this effort or aware of similar ones please let me know Edit 2 (in regards to comments on &#x27;reinventing the wheel&#x27; below): if Scala is so great as a language and functional programming flagship, where are all the libraries of functionally implemented algorithms replacing conventional CLRS style imperative/mutable implementations?

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m new here. I&#x27;m a Zettelkasten enthusiast going on 6 months now. I have about 1200 zettels, mainly about note-taking itself, organic growth, psychology, risk, practice, and other things that interest me outside of work. I&#x27;m a software developer by trade.
I thought I might introduce myself with an open-ended question. I recently transitioned from writing paper notes to using Zettlr. (Zettlr + Git just works for me.) One thing I really miss about my old paper ZK is being able to thumb through notes and stumble on things that way. In my new computerized system, I have to explicitly write links and do searches. There is no rifling aspect, and that seems like a bummer to me. Anyone have any similar thoughts? Or recommendations? I&#x27;m still working on how to organize things to capture that inherent structure that my old paper ZK had by the mere fact of two slips being near each other. I can type in 1200 slips, but that structure is essentially gone now.</span>

 Also is there any other way of doing directory navigation other than “SPC .”? I thinking something similar to NERDTree in vim?

                              <span>I use prettify-symbols mode heavily in my c++ code to map multicharacter operators to unicode.
 I also do things like map FLT_MAX to the infinity symbol, &quot;alpha&quot; to the alpha symbol, etc.
 I would like to have it that when I use the delete or backspace key on such a symbol, that rather than deleting one character of the underlying ascii text, it would delete the whole region of text that has that display attribute. 
 So, for instance, if I type &quot;FLT_MAX&quot; and it maps to the unicode infinity symbol, backspace wouldn&#x27;t delete the &#x27;X&#x27; at the end of that string, but rather the whole word &quot;FLT_MAX&quot;.
 I think I can code something like that myself possibly, by looking at the display attribute of the text before the cursor, but was wondering if someone had already done this.
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Hi There!
 I&#x27;m converting my work flow entirely to emacs. I normally use tmux to ssh to a machine, and most of the time there are commands that I run that output plain text on the terminal. Most of the time the output I need to copy and paste but only some sections of it. This is where tmux&#x27;s copy mode comes in handy, because I can now select/copy only portions of the contents(very similar to vim&#x27;s visual mode). 
 Is this possible to do in emacs? 
 Requirements:
  
multiple windows(tabbed like tmux)
 ssh from emacs
 while in that ssh session enter into a mode very similar to vim&#x27;s normal/visual mode, so I can copy portions of text as well as search through the shell output.
  
Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am trying to setup a org-roam-capture-new-node-hook, that will add a property to a daily/journal file automatically. while skipping other types of notes.
 here&#x27;s the function I have
 (defun my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p (file) &quot;Return t if FILE is an Org-roam daily-note, nil otherwise. If FILE is not specified, use the current buffer&#x27;s file-path.&quot; (when-let ((path (expand-file-name file)) (directory (expand-file-name org-roam-dailies-directory org-roam-directory))) (setq path (expand-file-name path)) (f-descendant-of-p path directory))) 
 When I call this normally, I get expected response.
 (when (my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p &quot;/path/to/org/roam/daily/2022-01-26.org&quot;) &quot;Cool&quot;) : Cool 
 But when I call this from the custom hook function,
 (defun my/add-auto-props-to-org-roam-dailies () &quot;Add properties to org-roam daily entry automatically&quot; (unless (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name)) (when (my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p (buffer-file-name)) (unless (org-find-property &quot;header-args:ledger&quot;) (org-roam-add-property (concat (file-name-as-directory (ledger-path-relative-to-org)) (file-name-base (buffer-file-name)) &quot;.ledger&quot;) &quot;header-args:ledger&quot;) (org-roam-add-property &quot;:tangle&quot; &quot;header-args:ledger&quot;))))) (add-hook! &#x27;org-roam-capture-new-node-hook #&#x27;my/add-auto-props-to-org-roam-dailies) 
 This does not seem to work as expected. The call to my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p seem to return nil for all files. Am I missing something here?
 if I remove the check (call for my/org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p), the property gets added correctly for all files, so rest of the code is working as intended.
 P.S. ledger-path-relative-to-org is a custom function that returns a relative path to where I expect the ledger files to get tangled.

                              <span>My Emacs become really slow when displaying images, specially in .org files with inline-images. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a common thing, so how do I improve that?

                              <span>Before I start I just want to apologize if this is a &quot;noob&quot; question, I&#x27;m just trying to learn.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve used Doom Emacs for a few months now, and from what I&#x27;ve seen, it is EXTREMELY powerful, so I *want* to use it. But here&#x27;s the problem for me. Some other programs, like VS Code are less powerful, but far, far easier for beginners. For instance the wide array of tutorial videos on YouTube, the way you change keybindings, or the way you download extra packages.
 I think that Emacs can be far more powerful than VS Code, provided you have the proper knowledge about how it works. A great example of this is dired, it&#x27;s so good that for a while I used it as my main file-manager. What&#x27;s the best way to go about learning Emacs though? Should I just stop using Doom Emacs, download GNU Emacs and learn that way?

                              <span>Some modern editors (like Obsidian) have this cool feature that when you navigate the cursor near formatted text it will show the formatting characters (like *foo*, /bar/) and otherwise just render them without showing the formatters.
 I was wondering how we can do something like this in Emacs. Is there any package for this or do you guys have any tips on how I could make such a thing?

 Something like the Ascii Tree Generator extension (https://github.com/aprilandjan/vscode-ascii-tree-generator).
 I found some packages like syntree and graph.el, but I&#x27;m looking for something that could work based on a simplified structure, like an org list.
 Thanks.

 I&#x27;ve seen https://emacsformacosx.com/builds but this is for the graphical version.
 &#x60;brew install emacs@25&#x60; doesn&#x27;t work.
 Is there a way to get an old terminal version of emacs? 
 EDIT: If anyone sees this later, the solution was that I needed to call a more specific version

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a pitfall for the --with-native-compilation option which I&#x27;d not previously considered...
 My work changed its anti-virus software, and my native-comp Emacs init time increased from ~2 seconds to ~15 seconds, because the libraries are now all native code and the virus-scanner goes to work on every one of them.
 Subsequent starts were fast (2-3 seconds) while the scanner had things cached, but later on they will be slow again.
 If you mostly only run Emacs once per session, that&#x27;s probably not an issue; otherwise it&#x27;s another thing to consider.
 If you&#x27;re using a native-comp build and loading libraries seems slow, this is a potential reason for that.

                              <span>Time for a new and exciting hls release:
  
It includes three brand new plugins: 
 Alternate number literals thanks to @drsooch
 Qualify imported names thanks to @eddiemundo
 New plugin to support selection range (aka double click text selection) thanks to @kokobd
 
 Finally hls supports ghc 9.2.1 
 Including core features and many plugins
 Thanks to a great collective effort coordinated by @pepeiborra and with the help of @wz1000, @mpickering and @alanz among others
 
 Hls now also supports ghc 9.0.2 with all plugins but the stylish-haskell formatter 
 Including the wingman plugin thanks to @isovector and @anka-213
 
 And many many fixes and performance improvements, thanks to all contributors!
  
Deprecation notice for 1.6.0
  
As we noted in the previous release we have dropped support for ghc versions 8.10.5 and 8.8.3 in this release 
 We recommend upgrading ghc to the last minor version: 8.8.4 or 8.10.7
 You can read more about ghc deprecation policy and schedule here
 
 After this release: 
 We will remove all project stack.yaml&#x27;s but two: one for last lts and other for nightly. Temporary we could keep one more stack yaml when nightly upgrades the ghc version, to help in the transition
 We will remove the install script which lives here
 If you want to install hls from source we recommend using ghcup. Download it and run ghcup compile hls --help to get more info about.

                              <span>Suppose we want to compare the length of two lists.
 The intuitive approach would be to just compute the length of both lists and then check whether that number is equal for both lists.
 However, if one list is much longer than the other, that this would cause unnecessary work.
 The faster approach would be to use a function like this:
 eqLength :: [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; Bool eqLength (_:xs) (_:ys) &#x3D; eqLength xs ys eqLength [] [] &#x3D; True eqLength _ _ &#x3D; False 
 This has complexity O(min(n,m)) where n and m are the lengths, as opposed to O(n + m).
 So a rewrite rule in GHC that rewrites (length xs &#x3D;&#x3D; length ys) -&gt; eqLength xs ys might seem to make sense performance wise. 
 But there is an issue: For lists that have infinite length, computing the length loops indefinitely, where as the eqLength function does not.
 The behavior of the program would therefore be different.
 Do you think such optimizations are sane for the compiler to do?

                              <span>For example, if I have the following signature:
 myFunction :: Names -&gt; State -&gt; CodeType
 The function takes a Names type and a State type and returns a CodeType, correct?
 Is it possible to edit the function to take a Names type or a People type as its first argument?
 Something like:
 myFunction :: (Names,People) -&gt; State-&gt;CodeType

 Thanks for your responses in advance. I am trying to learn Haskell.

                              <span>I own created a Scala i18n library and (after many failed attempts) am finally happy with how it is taking shape. The core idea is to leverage compile-time safety when dealing with i18n files. This is achieved by decoding the translations into case classes and by providing a type safe alternative to printf/MessageFormat which are usually used for String value injection. I consider the library to be highly experimental; the load module in particular is likely to undergo significant changes, error messages and documentation are to be improved. So I wouldn&#x27;t exactly recommend adopting it just‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­yet, but am very keen for feedback. https://github.com/slozzer/babel

                              <span>Hello guys.
 I was a developer for 2 decades, including asp.net/c# for 16 years. I quit a few years back for early retirement, but I found myself totally bored at home so I learned scala and apache spark for fun. Is that skillset enough to get some work in scala from home? Or would I need to learn kubernetes, akka, zio, cats or other tools?
 Which tools are most valued with scala?
 Thanks in advance for your input.

                              <span>Suppose I have a type &quot;Person&quot; with a name and an age. I have a txt file with people, and each line looks like this:
 Brian 30
 Carol 31
 ...
 I want to load each person from the txt file into Haskell for processing.
 In C++, I can do something like:
 Person loadPerson(string personString)
 {
 stringstream ss;
 ss &gt; personName;
 int personAge;
 ss &gt;&gt; personAge;
 return Person(personName,personAge);
 }
 What about in Haskell?

                              <span>It would be useful if this C library (https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870) were to be ported to Haskell or perhaps someone has already implemented a native version of the IEC 60870 family of protocols. 
 Some years ago there was an industrial automation company that might have implemented code to do that.

                              <span>I&#x27;m brand new to macos, emacs, brew, cask, etc. I come from Windows support, and have some Unix command line and scripting background. But the brew installation framework is confusing as hell to me. After some research, it seems like I should use something like one of the following to install emacs:
  
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
 brew install emacs-mac
  
OR
  
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
 brew install --cask emacs-mac. 
  
What&#x27;s the difference? Also, are there any other options that I should include when installing? (Also note that I want to learn org-mode.)
 A couple people on another thread suggested I install like one of these:
  
brew install emacs-mac --with-rsvg --with-natural-title-bar --with-starter --with-mac-metal --with-glib --with-imagemagick
 
https://github.com/mclear-tools/build-emacs-macos
 
 Note: I don&#x27;t really understand the above options very well. I don&#x27;t know what --whit-mac-metal means.

 My question is can you do something like this with checkboxes so that they go from untoggled [ ] to toggled [ x ] ?

I have the plugin installed but I can&#x27;t seem to get it to run my cs files. I try to run csharp-mode-menu but it says I need to have it mount to an event with parameters.. but I have no idea what that means. Also can&#x27;t find anywhere how I can compile my cs files too. Anyone know what Im missing?

                              <span>I just started using swiper as an isearch replacement (and none of the rest of ivy I&#x27;m afraid), but want it more or less to work like isearch after the long years of muscle memory :)
 Its close (see current config below, notably the ivy-height of 1 and keybinds.) already, with very little tweaking, yet gets some extra features. Love it!
 C-s and enter &#x27;foo bar&#x27; to search kicks swiper off, and then C-s and C-r to cycle through searches.
 I&#x27;m used to using point movement such as C-a or C-n to exit isearch; I&#x27;m okay with C-a/etc staying in the minibuf to edit the search criteria. Using enter to complete the search can be okay, though ivy/swiper sometimes gets into this &#x27;need a match!&#x27; loop where enter just stays in there... fine.
 But I&#x27;m thinking that C-s/C-r cycle the matches, why also does…</span>

 Ever wondered - what if multimedia editing were as simple as text manipulation? Simple cut, copy and paste operations. Thanks to VLC and FFMPEG, now you can use GNU Emacs for simple multimedia editing tasks.

                              <span>Perhaps I misunderstood. But it seems the usual implementation of this common suggestion is to switch it everywhere. 
 Is there a way to do it only for emacs? Do other non-GNU Emacs emacs has an option to switch it within the software? 
 I use Arch btw.

 (defmacro dup (f x) &quot;Call F by applying X twice.&quot; (if (symbolp f) (list f x x) (append f (list x x)))) 
 It does work:
 (dup concat &quot;me&quot;) ; &quot;meme&quot; (dup (concat &quot;nice &quot;) &quot;me&quot;) ; &quot;nice meme&quot; 
 However, it has some undesireable behaviour:
 (macroexpand &#x27;(dup some-function (long (composition x)))) ; (some-function (long (composition x)) (long (composition x))) 
 How do I make a macro that evaluates X once? I understand I could do it with a function, but I like that I don&#x27;t have to quote things in a macro.

                              <span>I want to add a facility to an existing major mode so that some of the keywords that the mode defines have a different face applied. 
 (defface my-keyword-override-face &#x27;((t :inherit font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic :underline t)) &quot;WTF face&quot;) 
 That mode already define the special case keyword regex and applies the font-lock-warning-face and I want to replace that with my face:
 (,special-case-keywords-regexp . ,my-keyword-override-face) 
 Literally all I&#x27;ve done is define a face and change font-lock-warning-face with my new face.
 It fails with a message i the message biffer saying:
 Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (void-variable my-keyword-override-face) 
 That&#x27;s coming from font-lock.
 In the lisp buffer that defines a major mode where I added the face
 (defface my-keyword-override-face &#x27;((t :inherit font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic :underline t)) &quot;WTF face&quot;) 
 I place my cursor at the end of the defface and M-x eval-print-last-sexp and beneath it in the buffer I see. 
 my-keyword-override-face 
 The &#x27;defface&#x27; is at location 4120 in the buffer and directly after that I have 
 (add-text-properties 4120 4127 &#x60;(face ,my-keyword-override-face)) 
 Place my cursor after that sexp and M-x eval-print-last-sexpagain. 
 I&#x27;m thrown into a lisp debugger 
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable my-keyword-override-face) (list &#x27;face my-keyword-override-face) (add-text-properties 4120 4127 (list &#x27;face my-keyword-override-face)) (progn (add-text-properties 4120 4127 (list &#x27;face my-keyword-override-face))) elisp--eval-last-sexp(t) eval-last-sexp(t) eval-print-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-print-last-sexp nil) command-execute(eval-print-last-sexp) 
 Can someone please help me understand what I&#x27;m dong wrong and how I should be replacing a modes face with one that I&#x27;ve defined.

 The tag &quot;DONE&#x27; is left not struck through.
 How could get them all struck through, better if star * symbols are also considered.

                              <span>Remnote has the function of an daily document. You only can create on daily document per day. I wanted to create this functionality for orgmode as a starting point to orgmode (never used it before). My imagination is to have a shortcuts with Alfred wich are always linked to my daily document. Does someone tried already similar and perhaps can advice a little bit or generally does someone know how to approach this in the best way?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 While scrolling among some RFC, I was wondering if there is a simple way to edit and/or export text file with two text zones independently justified. Like this headers for example where headers are formatted with left and right justified text zones.
 cheers

                              <span>Hi there, apologies in advance if it&#x27;s a weird post, but with org-mode and Emacs in general I often end up at a stage where I need someone to explain things to me step by step.
 So, I already use the base org-mode under doom emacs for my drafts for scientific articles and PhD thesis, but I often end up having to switch to Word for referencing. I saw org-ref and helm-bibtex might work for me, since they both offer the possibility of inserting article links to a .bib file, that I would export from my reference manager. I even found a post that explains how to set up something similar, but I find that workflow overwhelming to implement as there is A LOT MORE going on.
 I think the best way for me to overcome this would be to add those things one step at a time to understand how they work.
 All I would need at this stage is to
  
Write things with headers and basic formatting
 Add citations and some piece of content (formulas, images, code, etc.)
 Export to pdf
  
so question would be: can I make a barebone workflow that can integrate all these pieces and make something somewhat functional? 
 My idea would be to try and implement something like org-noter for my PDFs at a later point, while having some minimal functioning setting at first.
 Thank you all in advance, any help is much appreciated.

May it be of benefit for your own projects. ~Caleb
We users of a Zettelkasten strive for a set of ideals: that we don&#x27;t only collect knowledge but integrate it and use it in the service of our own knowledge work; that use of a Zettelkasten generates new connections and insights for us in that work (as Luhmann said, as a conversation partner); that our organization of notes allows for clear thinking and organized ideas.
At least those are the ideals I had in mind when I commenced my thesis research. Truthfully, I adopted the ZK method precisely because I want…</span>

#informationsecurity #ics #incidentmanagement #detection
While monitoring network and software data can be used to discover anomalies and detect early signs of attacks, expanding to monitor the status of physical variables, such as temperature and sounds can indicate unusual activity. Early detection of an attack in the ICS environment could minimize the potential impact of an attack as it could be used to pivot [[20210908145033 Simplified Attack Vector OT IT]] into other parts of the network (like the enterprise network) [[20220120110715 Incident Response in ICS - Detection]].

How can I disable this? The only other mention of this problem I can find is an abandoned stack overflow thread, where one commenter suggests trying to start Emacs without any configurations, (emacs -Q) which did not solve the problem.

 I would like to load a custom init file (.el) when I open a .py file. Among other things, it sets a custom theme. I think one way to go is to use an elpy-hook, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t make it work. Here is my attempt:
 (add-hook &#x27;elpy-mode-hook (load &quot;/path/to/file&quot;))
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hi all! 
 I&#x27;ve started using org-habit this week. I can set my habits and see the nice colored consistency graph to track visually my habits.
 However, I would like to have a numeric record of this. For example, something for each habit, I am imagining something like the statistics cookies:
 Number of repetitions done / Number of repetitions scheduled Percent of repetitions done % 
 Or even better, have some stats about how many repetitions I have done a habit in a row (similar to &quot;don&#x27;t break the chain&quot;).
 I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to do it directly with the org-habit module or if something else is necessary. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>From looking at FSF&#x27;s site, the most recent version of GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is not available as a hard copy. But I&#x27;d like to have a nicely bound hardback of this. Anyone have a good experience with printing such texts and having good outcomes that they could recommend? Or does anyone know if FSF actually does offer the most recent version as a hard copy?
 ​
 This is 1337 pages, so it would likely be hardback (but that&#x27;s not a requirement on my part - I think some print on demand companies I&#x27;ve used in the past had a requirement that anything above a certain amount of pages had to be hardback, though).

                              <span>I always dreaded having to print simple file folder labels, which I need to do a lot. It would mean going to a Windows or Mac machine, spinning up the very slow Dymo label making software, getting the GUI designer right, inserting the label text, printing, and wash-rinse-repeat.
 I wrote a gem to provide a simple command-line program to print labels from a shell. As a bonus, it includes some simple elisp to provide printing the current paragraph from within an emacs buffer as a label.
 This is a bit of a hobby project, written as a Ruby gem, but it eliminated a big hassle for me.
 Here is the link: labrat or install the ruby gem labrat.

                              <span>Hello Reddit Emacs community. I just wanted to share tb-keycast global minor mode. Might be useful for someone who stream/record Emacs videos.
 https://github.com/ir33k/tb-keycast
 Created as alternative to keycast package that does the same thing in mode-line. I was trying this original package but found that it doesn&#x27;t behave exactly like I wanted so I created my own from scratch.
 Originally it was also integrated with mode-line but since I&#x27;m on newer Emacs version I took the opportunity to move it to tab-bar. I think it&#x27;s much better that way.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs for a few months now, and I keep finding all the amazing features it has to offer. The problem is that there are so many features that I&#x27;m afraid of missing out on some of the most useful ones simply due to the sheer amount of commands available.
 For example, I had no idea that you could move text up or down a line by holding down alt and then the up or down arrow keys, or that you could navigate through paragraphs with the curly brackets. These are all incredible features that could save me hours of time.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Haskell and have been working through an old problem set.
 I have a Log.hs file that contains these data types:
 data MessageType &#x3D; Info | Warning | Error Intderiving (Show, Eq)type TimeStamp &#x3D; Intdata LogMessage &#x3D; LogMessage MessageType TimeStamp String | Unknown Stringderiving (Show, Eq)data MessageTree &#x3D; Leaf | Node MessageTree LogMessage MessageTreederiving (Show, Eq)
 I have another file, LogAnalysis.hs, that imports LogMessage and MessageType from Log.hs
 module LogAnalysis whereimport Log (LogMessage, MessageType(Error))parse :: (String) -&gt; LogMessage parse str &#x3D; LogMessage (Error 10) 4500 &quot;hello&quot;
 Haskell complains that the LogMessage data constructor my code is trying to use is not in scope:
 LogAnalysis.hs:4:17: error:
 * Data constructor not in scope:
 LogMessage :: MessageType -&gt; t0 -&gt; [Char] -&gt; LogMessage
 * Perhaps you want to add &#x60;LogMessage&#x27; to the import list
 in the import of &#x60;Log&#x27; (LogAnalysis.hs:2:5-47).
  
   
  
 I&#x27;ve looked at my code and done some research, and I can&#x27;t figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong. Will someone please help?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been picking up Haskell these past few days, and I am wondering if there is a way to create and train a neural network in Haskell. After all, a neural network can be mathematically described as a function that, given a series of inputs, will return a series of outputs.
 Any ideas on how I might go about building and training a neural network in Haskell, using my NVIDIA GPU?

                              <span>So I&#x27;d like to automatically fold headings with :deferred: tag as folded. I can do this using the VISIBILITY tag, but that&#x27;s not as neat, and would need to be set for each heading as well as the :deferred:.
 Basically I&#x27;d like something similar to the :noexport: tag and the SELECT_TAGS and EXCLUDE_TAGS settings used by org export, except for initial visibility.
 I think what might be needed is some way to set the VISIBILITY tag for all headings with a given tag.
 I&#x27;ve had a search around but no mechanism jumping out at me, yet it does seem like something that somebody might reasonably want to do ...

 The shell folder have the result of the shell.org tangled blocks.
 README.org will be my master index for all others in docs. In this file I want it to be something like this:
 Here I was able to use the :toc: header arg, but it only worked for the current file.
  
Table of contents (TOC) (README.org) 
 ...
 
 SHELL (here I want to display the shell.org file TOC) 
 aliases (other file link; in the * ALIASES position)
 env_vars (like aliases)
 function (like aliases)
 myrc (like aliases)
 
 HOOKs (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
 SETUPS (TOC of hooks.org)
 ...
  
-----------------------------------------------------
 I tried including the shell.org summary like this:
  
SHELL 
 #+INCLUDE &quot;./.docs/shell.org::*TOC&quot;
 
  
But this creates a local link with this extructe: [[#header][header]]. I can&#x27;t click and they don&#x27;t work on github. I also have to export the file I&#x27;m editing so they show up in the current buffer, it would be nice if they show up after I write the changes like :toc: does (if anyone knows how to do this it would be great).
 Manually I can write the links that work as TOC like this:
  
SHELL 
 [file:./.docs/shell.org#ALIASES][aliases]]
 ...
 
  
I could do this manually, but it would be a lot of work and if I updated or modified external files the README.org would not be updated.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;ve just installed doom emacs and I&#x27;m using it for org mode. Currently I am experiencing an issue with creating a list with sub items(parent item with children items)
 For whatever reason when I&#x27;m creating the child item, I get three asterisk when I should get 2.
 Key combination: type item 1, shift right arrow to change to TODO, alt enter to create additional item, tab to indent item into a child item.
 expected behavior:
 . item1 .. item2
 Actual behavior:
 . item1 ... item2
 I was attempting to google this but it&#x27;s kinda hard to google this exact issue. 
 Thanks for any help!

Student Loan Forgiveness is Regressive
Subatomic: Knock on effects of across-the-board loan forgiveness.
Surprising second order effects (Trophic cascade [[201901171252]]) of student loan forgiveness. More children of families in the middle and upper tiers of society go to university and take out loans to pay for it. These families can handle the loan burden. They tend to get larger loans to pay for education. That education lands them high paying jobs where they can afford to pay back the loan. Loan forgiveness favors these upper income people to a larger extent and with a larger amount of money than those less fortunate. This increases rather than decreases the economic gap between social classes.
B-The Other [[202102012019]]

  
Across-the-board forgiveness is therefore a costly and ineffective way to reduce economic gaps by race or socioeconomic status. 1
…Accounting correctly for both human capital and effect of subsidies in student lending plans, almost a third of all student debt is owed by the wealthiest 20 percent of households and only 8 percent by the bottom 20 percent. Across-the-board student loan forgiveness is regressive measured by income, family affluence, educational attainment—and also wealth.1

                              <span>This post may belong better on the KM or AppleScript forums, but I thought I&#x27;d ask here first mainly because I bet someone will have a far easier process than I&#x27;m trying to build.
After writing a Zettel in The Archive, I want to remind myself to review it in a day, and after that, remind myself for a few days later.  A progressive review kind of thing.
I have a KM macro that:
Prompts me for the number of days, from a pre-made list.
Writes a tag (#ReviewXDays, where X is the number of days) to an inserted 2nd line on the Zettel
Copies the Zettel&#x27;s h1 (from the 3rd character to the end of the line)
Creates an Apple reminder &quot;Review such-and-such Zettel&quot; with a due date of the number of days out
It all works except the calculated Reminders date at the very end.  I think it must be either a variable type problem, or a syntax problem in the AppleScript.  I have a temporary KM Action before the last step that displays the date I&#x27;m trying to use.  If I simply copy that (correct-looking) result and paste it as a constant string in the final KM action, it works.  It just won&#x27;t accept the variable version of that date.
The error is some variation of &quot;execution error: reminders got an error: can&#x27;t get date (1/27/2022)&quot;, depending on the tweaks I&#x27;ve tried in the script syntax.
Has anyone
created some kind of progressive review automation for themselves that&#x27;s better than this
worked with pushing a due date to Reminders via AppleScript
The image is of the last few actions, where the &quot;make new reminder&quot; line in the AppleScript is where I fail.

...and here is my KM macro (1st time sharing, hope I do this right):
Add Review Tag

Reactivity #Self #Persona
In my experience, dogs respond when people have built a strong persona. It is no different with us humans. People who have a strong persona come across to us as dishonest, insincere, insecure and/or generally untrustworthy.
However, we humans have a special tolerance for people with strong personas because we usually have a personas ourselves. In a sense, we humans play a kind of social poker game and are familiar with the rules. We are, in a sense, talented and skilled at interacting with untrustworthy people. We have the security of being practiced.
Dogs, on the other hand, have no persona. The difference between a publicly displayed mask (persona) and a self hidden behind it is not understandable by them. What t…</span>

 Can anyone recommend some good companies to work for in the US if I&#x27;d like to write Scala? I&#x27;ve got almost 10 years&#x27; experience, most of that in Scala. I&#x27;m currently working for a social media company, but mostly dealing with bureaucracy and legacy maintenance; I haven&#x27;t written any code for work in ~2 months. :(

                              <span>This is a generic async/await transformer for scala3 which allows using effectful monads in the direct style. URL: (https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async )
 The most significant change is the introduction of the monad context, which opens the possibility of implementing cases like timeouts and structured concurrency. Also, we received potential source-code compatibility with monadic-reflection encoding;
 A brief description of the feature is here: https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/MonadContexts.html
 Those changes cause the break of binary compatibility, so also published new versions for:
  
integration libraries (https://github.com/rssh/cps-async-connect ) for akka-stream, cats-effects, fs2, monix, scalaz and zio
 scala-gopher (https://github.com/rssh/scala-gopher ) implementation of CSP constructs, i.e. channels/selectors for scala.

                              <span>Most developers choose the path of least resistance. Effect systems are not low resistance and its very hard for experienced functional programmers to explain why its so great. Even ZIO that makes it a little bit more straight forward is still a huge leap from where most programmers are. 
 Compare this to say Rust. Rust requires more from the programmers but the rules around borrowing and lifetimes are relativly easy to understand it takes a while to learn fully. But the motivation is there because its performance and its measurable. Do you want your programms to be 2x+ fast then writ it in Rust.
 Effects systems are very abstract concepts. First that you are describing a program in a program. Then the notion that non purity is bad. Monads, functors etc. There is alot to understand because in the long run you need to understand them.
 I&#x27;m currently learning and I like it. Not that I&#x27;m fully aware of all benefits but I like learning. 
 When I look at the majority of programmers that I have worked with. They like their job and they program in whatever language they happened to end up with and very few wants to invest in learning a whole new paradigm. It&#x27;s so hard to get developers to let go of Java 8 some times. Most Java developers have probably never used records in Java. 
 So what am I getting to. I don&#x27;t know actually :-D just something I have been thinking about. 
 What do you think. Can effect systems ever be mainstream? I can&#x27;t really see it ever happening if most developers doesn&#x27;t suddenly become super interested in learning new stuff.
 Also if you believe it can go mainstream how us it going to happen?

                              <span>Writing a test suite is a crucial step when developing high-assurance software.
Yet, identifying meaningful properties of the system and giving it suitable
inputs may be hard. This is especially challenging for code involving state —
besides properties and inputs, one must also take into account the state of the
system at all times.
It is inconvenient to construct states suitable for testing by hand. An
alternative is to build sequences of inputs that can be iterated over the
initial state, placing the system in a state we want to test. These sequences
of inputs are called traces.
For these traces to be useful for testing, it must be possible to:
report traces to the user in an informative way when some post-condition fails
modify traces by changing some or all inputs sent in them

                              <span>Lately, since switching to using Emacs 28 (using the emacs-plus build), I run into the following issue: when simply trying to open a file, Emacs freezes for a few seconds before doing so. 
 Now: 
  
I&#x27;ve had this happen multiple times when opening a single .el file while visiting a buffer with a different .el file on, so there should be no delay coming from running any mode-related hooks etc, at least as far as I understand these things. 
 I&#x27;ve had this happen long after starting an Emacs session, so any package being loaded with a :defer n call (via use-package) should have been loaded. 
  
I&#x27;ve been trying to use the one tool I sort of knew of for this, explain-pause-mode, but something appears to be wrong with the package but for some reason the package isn&#x27;t working anymore. I&#x27;ve now had the profiler start by default and tried to look at the profiler report right after I notice the lag, but that hasn&#x27;t given me any clues. 
 I&#x27;m thinking of resetting the profiler every few seconds or so to see if that helps, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here knows of another way to figure out what&#x27;s going on. 
 I&#x27;ve been reluctant to bisect my init since as I said before sometimes hours go by without running into this problem.

                              <span>It&#x27;s just a short snippet in case you need to browse an SQL dump. It makes the dump more readable by adding field names as comments which can be helpful with tables having lots of fields. It needs to be a dump which contains field names too.
 Here&#x27;s an example with a trivial table. 
 The original dump:
 INSERT INTO &#x60;student&#x60; (&#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;name&#x60;, &#x60;class&#x60;, &#x60;mark&#x60;, &#x60;gender&#x60;) VALUES (1, &#x27;John Deo&#x27;, &#x27;Four&#x27;, 75, &#x27;female&#x27;), (2, &#x27;Max Ruin&#x27;, &#x27;Three&#x27;, 85, &#x27;male&#x27;), (3, &#x27;Arnold&#x27;, &#x27;Three&#x27;, 55, &#x27;male&#x27;), ... 
 the converted dump:
 INSERT INTO &#x60;student&#x60; (&#x60;id&#x60;, &#x60;name&#x60;, &#x60;class&#x60;, &#x60;mark&#x60;, &#x60;gender&#x60;) VALUES ( /* id */ 1, /* name */ &#x27;John Deo&#x27;, /* class */ &#x27;Four&#x27;, /* mark */ 75, /* gender */ &#x27;female&#x27;), ( /* id */ 2, /* name */ &#x27;Max Ruin&#x27;, /* class */ &#x27;Three&#x27;, /* mark */ 85, /* gender */ &#x27;male&#x27;), ( /* id */ 3, /* name */ &#x27;Arnold&#x27;, /* class */ &#x27;Three&#x27;, /* mark */ 55, /* gender */ &#x27;male&#x27;), ... 
 The code:
 (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;) VALUES&quot; nil t) (beginning-of-line) (search-forward &quot;(&quot;) (let ((start (point)) fields) (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (forward-sexp) (push (buffer-substring-no-properties start (point)) fields) (skip-syntax-forward &quot;. &quot;) (setq start (point))) (setq fields (mapcar (lambda (field) (substring field 1 -1)) (reverse fields))) (while (progn (search-forward &quot;(&quot;) (let ((fields fields)) ;; make a copy (while (not (eq ?\) (char-after))) (insert (concat &quot; /* &quot; (pop fields) &quot; */ &quot;)) (forward-sexp) (if (looking-at &quot;,&quot;) (forward-char 1)) (skip-syntax-forward &quot; &quot;))) (looking-at &quot;),&quot;))))))

Creates a toggle-function that executes BUFFER-CREATE-FN if a buffer named BUFFER-NAME doesn&#x27;t exist, switches to the buffer named BUFFER-NAME if it exists, and switches to the previous buffer if we are currently visiting buffer BUFFER-NAME.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to start emacs in a vterm buffer. I believe I could do this by setting initial-buffer-choice to a function that loads vterm, but my elisp knowledge is rudimentary. 
 What would that function look like?
 Any help is much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using use-package to manage my packages, and running into a (technically ignorable but suspicious) behavior where, after an update, list-packages tells me that there&#x27;s a ton of packages that aren&#x27;t needed and can be removed, and to run package-autoremove to remove them. However, this seems to be almost all of my installed packages.
 Is this a known issue/conflict with Melpa packages/use-package/something else, or is it offering to remove the older versions, or is something messed up?
 It&#x27;s not a huge issue as I can just.... not answer y to package-autoremove.... but it shouldn&#x27;t be considering everything unneeded. Plus I guess it prevents me from later removing actually unneeded stuff...
 Anyone else have this issue?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Inspired by Emacs From Scratch I decided to upend my IDE functionality in my config for lsp-mode. LSP starts and is functional, but lsp-ui is shoddy. The sideline functionality and the header breadcrumbs do not work. For me this is not a big deal, but what is bothering me is that lsp-ui-flycheck-list does not work. I need to manually run M-x load-library lsp-ui-flycheck and only then will lsp-ui-flycheck-list show me the list of errors on the page. This leads me to believe there is a loading issue somewhere.
 the relevant init section is this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package lsp-mode :straight t :commands lsp :hook ((typescript-mode js2-mode web-mode python-mode) . lsp) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map (&quot;TAB&quot; . completion-at-point)) :custom (lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil))
 (use-package lsp-ui :straight t :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :config (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable t) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-doc-position &#x27;bottom) (lsp-ui-doc-show))
 (use-package lsp-treemacs :after lsp)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 After startup I do see a few relevant error messages:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ... File mode specification error: (error The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section) Error running timer: (error &quot;The connected server(s) does not support method textDocument/hover. To find out what capabilities support your server use ‘M-x lsp-describe-session’ and expand the capabilities section&quot;) LSP :: pylsp:11352 initialized successfully in folders: ...
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Can this be the source of the problem ?
 thx. S

 I have org files with lots of sections of all sorts (markdown, plain text, code, calculations, directory trees, etc., etc.), some of them within babel #+begin and #+end delimiters, some not. All these sections have some implicit foldable structure. Some have exisiting appropriate language modes, some do not.
 My question is, in coding up custom folding commands for these sections, should I try and base the commands on extending the folding functions provided by org-mode, or should I choose my preferred folding library (of which there are many) and extend it, potentially clashing with org-mode in some way?
 I think I like stateful/persistent folding as in &quot;vimish-fold&quot;. I prefer staying within the org-mode buffer rather escaping to a dedicated buffer and returning.
 Any pointers to discussions much appreciated.

                              <span>hello, dears.
 I&#x27;m on a quest. I&#x27;ve been travelling for a while. And I might be closing on its end, I feel. With Emacs.
 I have MIDI devices connected to a Macbook. I need Emacs to listen to their MIDI events and insert as text. Simple. Just letters or numbers.
 Google has brought me to these ways:
 - emacswiki, emaccordion, midimacs, midi-kbd : based on ALSA (linux), unavailable in Mac OS X.
 - (make-serial-port) : MIDI devices are generally USB, not serial.
 ​
 Could someone point me in the right direction?

 But why? Also C-x C-c also works well. I do not see that this would cause any problems. And it seams like that the server is still running.

 Any idea how to target this element?

                              <span>When I&#x27;m in for example c-mode, lsp-mode and fly-check are automatically started, and it&#x27;s necessary to turn them off with lsp-disconnect &amp; toggling (global-flycheck-mode).
 What I&#x27;ve tried so far:
  
c-mode-hook with lsp-disconnect, lsp-ui, global-flycheck-mode toggle
 with-eval-after-load &#x27;c-mode. The same as above
  
Neither work.
 lsp-disconnect is not available when I call it in my .emacs config for hooking c-mode (but it is for with-eval-after-load, although that still doesn&#x27;t work).
 Global-flycheck-mode is apparently toggled on even if i turn it off by something.
 I thought, Maybe Lsp is toggling it on? I tried (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none) which doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference for flychek.
 Even when I disable lsp manually by lsp-disconnect for that buffer, it seems to always come back somehow and re-enable itself even while i just stay editing that single buffer.
 Anyone know how I can have these two disabled at startup but toggleable when needed?

                              <span>I read the emails in my Gmail account in Gnus but I don&#x27;t store the emails locally, and instead use Gnus&#x27;s nnimap backend to fetch them. I occasionally want to link to an email from an Org file and want to know how to do it in a robust way. Linking to an email that is still in my INBOX works, but as soon as it expires the link is dead. I thought using gnus-cache-enter-article (bound to *) would instruct Gnus to keep the email around so the link would continue to work, but it doesn&#x27;t: oddly Gnus still shows the starred email in my INBOX even if it is marked as expired, but the Org link stops working.
 I don&#x27;t delete any email from my Gmail account so in principle I could have long-lasting links to emails there. I bet somebody has already figured out what to do. I can think of a few possibilities:
  
Maybe there&#x27;s a way to process the links to point to [Gmail]/All Mail instead, which seem to last longer, but I believe the also stop working after a while (I&#x27;m not sure they do, but I have a vague recollection of testing this once, maybe the Gmail IMAP implementation is responsible for the impermanence).
 
Maybe * doesn&#x27;t keep the links working, but Gnus has several other ways of marking messages to be kept and one of those methods works (I&#x27;m no expert on Gnus!).
 
Maybe there&#x27;s a convenient way to keep locally copies of the messages in another Gnus backend? Like maybe I can copy a message to some other account which I only use for local storage, and link to that copy instead?
 
 Does anyone have a good method for this, using any of those ideas or a different better one?

 3 months ago I wrote a post about an opening for a Haskell software engineer in my team. This position is still opened and maybe someone over wants a new start for 2022!
 We are looking for someone who is already comfortable with Haskell, the main language used in my team. (we also maintain a small Go application and some system tests are written using Python).
 Please have a look at the job description for more details about the company and the technology: https://boards.greenhouse.io/symbiont/jobs/4134418004. You can apply via the Greenhouse website and send me an email directly if you are interested ([eric.torreborre@symbiont.io](mailto:eric.torreborre@symbiont.io)).

If you have a web server written in Haskell that allows users to create and log into accounts, this library might interest you, and we&#x27;d love to have feedback as we refine the interface of the library. The source of the library is available here, feel free to open issues, PRs or leave a comment here!
 The WebAuthn standard allows users to easily and securely authenticate to websites with public key credentials, generated and stored on secure authenticators like Yubikeys, TouchID, TPM and more. This can either be used to secure accounts with second-factor authentication, or as a first factor, allowing users to log in without a password or…</span>

                              <span>Any boolean comparision involving NaN returns False. Any compare involving NaN returns GT. Thus, the presence of NaN is disastrous for sets and other collections that depend on Eq and Ord. How is this problem dealt with in Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;m going through &quot;Category Theory for Programmers&quot; and I&#x27;m trying to make sense of the author&#x27;s description of the type Void.
 An excerpt:
  
It’s a type that’s not inhabited by any values. You can define a function that takes Void, but you can never call it. To call it, you would have to provide a value of the type Void, and there just aren’t any. As for what this function can return, there are no restrictions whatsoever. It can return any type (although it never will, because it can’t be called).
  
Then it proceeds to explain that a singleton set is actually type ()
 This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me - why isn&#x27;t a function that is the equivalent of { return 32 } the same as a morphism mapping an empty set to a non-empty set? And why can&#x27;t you call a function whose argument is the equivalent of an empty set? And finally, how is () the equivalent of a set with a single member?
 UPDATE: While typing this, I think it finally clicked - still looking for confirmation. An Empty set can only map to an Empty set because there are no elements to transform. Which is why () is some universal element because it implies that you can map a set with one thing to any one other thing. Is this right?

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I start my day by creating a new daily note (with org-roam). Right now it looks like so:
  
[ ] write a journal
 [ ] check slack
 [ ] check important tasks etc
  
What I would like to do is insert various steps based on criteria. For example:
  
at the end of the month, insert - [ ] month review
 at the beginning of the month, - [ ] review personal tasks
  
If for whatever reason I miss the &quot;beginning of the mont&quot; or &quot;end of the month&quot;, I want this check list item to appear still. Is there a package out there that does something like this? I&#x27;m sure I can come up with custom elisp, but I thought I&#x27;d check in before I do that.

                              <span>I have noticed that org-clock-in can be slow at times, especially when restarting emacs or my laptop (I&#x27;m talking about emacs completely freezing for ~10 seconds). As far as I can tell this is because my entire org directory is scanned for dangling clocks. I&#x27;m only using clocking in a handfull of files, is there a recommended and tested to restrict the way dangling clocks are scanned or any other advice that might be helpful?

                              <span>As react is now the most popular FE framework by a mile (and I and countless others work in it daily), it drives me crazy there&#x27;s no major-mode for it. I&#x27;ve done a ton of googling and tried a lot of solutions people put online, and I did have some that worked decently well, but none are perfect and the one I was just using broke after an update (like many I&#x27;ve tried before have). I feel like the best solution would be to just write a major-mode for it, it would help keep a lot of web devs on emacs who like the extensibility but are frustrated by the amount of work it takes to just get jsx/tsx to be supported like they are in every other major editor (maybe vim aside, I never use it so I can&#x27;t say).
 I have some basic emacs experience, I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 3 years and have fiddled around with some packages and gone through elisp tutorials and even built some dumb programs to play around (like a tic-tac-toe game), but I honestly don&#x27;t know the first thing about writing a major mode, and while I&#x27;ve read some tutorials on doing so I know people who have experience doing this have a much better idea of what would need to be done, how to break down the work required, and what modern tools (thinking treesitter) could be used to make the syntax parsing, etc much easier.
 I do work full time and am also doing my MBA, but I&#x27;d be more than happy to dedicate a night or two a week to get this moving. Unless there&#x27;s something else out there or someone has started on something, I&#x27;d be more than happy to contribute, I just need some guidance on getting up to speed on everything required for a fully-functional major mode. Hopefully this isn&#x27;t some pipe dream, I feel like with tree-sitter and lsp (and the foundational work already done for other js modes) we could come up with something really solid. Let me know your thoughts, appreciated!

                              <span>I use nvm to manage node versions. When I inspect exec-path, it contains a version of node that I no longer have installed, i.e. ~/.nvm/versions/node/v17.3.0/bin is in my exec-path, but I only have the most recent stable and lts versions installed (v17.4 and v.16.3.2, respectively).
 So, two questions:
 1 - Naturally, how can I fix this? I&#x27;ve tried using (setenv NODE_PATH ...), but that didn&#x27;t work. I tried (setq exec-path (append exec-path (file-name-directory (shell-command-to-string &quot;which node&quot;)))) but that didn&#x27;t do the trick either.
 2 - How might this have happened, so I can stop it from happening again in the future?
 Thanks very much.

                              <span>Is there an easy way to move a ton of org files into org-roam? I&#x27;ve used just a flat directory of org files that I&#x27;ve searched with the excellent Deft package for years, and I&#x27;d like to give org-roam a whirl. Is there an easy way to import all those notes in bulk? (Don&#x27;t all notes need an ID?)

 Something in my Doom Emacs setup is popping up a message that says, &quot;You should have a section marked &quot;;;; Code:&quot;

To work around this limitation I created an Elisp command that sends an Ex command to Vim and gets the output back in Emacs.

 It&#x27;s not a package since most likely you have to adjust it to fit your system and I don&#x27;t have the capability to make it works for everyone. Also, it has a major drawback that I will mention at the end.
 When you call this command it asks for an input command exactly like Evil. The only difference is that the evaluation of the command is done by vim. This has both advantages and disadvantages.
 Advantages:
  
It understands more ex commands than evil.

 When i try to use pandas it does not recognize any pd functions (eg pd.read_csv) , it does let me use matplotlib, sklearn etc. When i try it within emacs python shell it works, as well as in the regular terminal (writing it in vim then executing the code). Any and all help would be really appreciated.
 The error message: AttributeError: module &#x27;pandas&#x27; has no attribute &#x27;read_csv&#x27;

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 There is a version 0.4 out for the dtache package. The short description of the package is that it provides the possibility to run commands that are detached from Emacs. To read more see the README here https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache. The major changes compared to the last release is:
  
dtache now integrates with the built in notifications library and this is used as default now for all users
 dtache now uses filenotify to monitor the decoupled processes. This is done for both local and remote commands.
 dtache now fully supports users on macOS
 dtache now is pre-configured with bindings in its minor/major-modes in order to simplify configurations for the users
 dtache is now available on ELPA, MELPA and as a Guix package

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m using doom emacs on macos and trying to define a keybinding to do following using embark and vertico:
  
Say I&#x27;m scrolling through a file list (find-file, org-roam-node-find etc).
 I find a file that I may need, I press C-; v and it opens in a new vertical window.
  
Essentially C-x 4 C-f but in reverse order. I want to select the file first and then open it in a vertical or horizontal window (same frame).
 This is what I have so far:
 (map! :map embark-file-map :desc &quot;Open file in v-split&quot; &quot;v&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (+evil/window-vsplit-and-follow) (find-file (embark--vertico-selected))) :desc &quot;Open file in h-split&quot; &quot;h&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (+evil/window-split-and-follow) (find-file (embark--vertico-selected)))) 
 I expected this to let me select and file and then decide weather to open in vertical/horizontal window.
 But I get this error: embark PCH: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil). I understand the error, but don&#x27;t know how to pass the file name to the find-file function.
 Also is this the correct way to define an embark mapping for doom?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, 
 Rather recently, I am getting into integrating emacs shell into my workflow. I found that shell works best for me. I tried e-shell but it did not render very well (am I missing something here).
 I would like to improve my shell experience and I was hoping for some help on that front. Specifically. 
  
Using, something like ls in my default shell color codes the directories and files. But shell in emacs doesn&#x27;t do that. (I am using zsh shell default.) 
 
The shell quotes every command. So typing ls will first print ls then the output. I will like to avoid that. 
 
Somewhat asinine of me, but I tried to invoke nano in side emacs shell. But then I couldn&#x27;t terminate the process and had to kill the shell. Is there a way around it? 
 
Is it advisable to run tmux in the shell?
 
 Thank you very much for your time and any suggestions towards shell customization is welcome!

                              <span>Doom has been nice! Thanks for all the contributors! But I decide to live independent to it. One immediate obstacle is the loss of the mighty map! macro. What are some alternatives for undoomed+evil users?
 I&#x27;ve heard that general.el is quite good, but is it as powerful as map!? And if so, are there some role-model configs to learn from?
  
EDIT While map! is a macro built on top of general, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be thin.. source.

 repo/web: https://git.sr.ht/~mplscorwin/emacs-w64
 tl;dr: emacs 28 binary downloads as Installer or ZIP
 The &quot;latest-greatest&quot; is in the &quot;with-native-compilation&quot; folder. Those match what I expect will be Available Soon™ from alpha.gnu.org. 
 These support the native compiler provided a working msys2 installation (with libgccjit, GCC) in PATH. The rest of the dependencies (rsvg, libxml, jansson, ...) are included (unless you grab a &quot;no-deps&quot; version).
 NOTE: the full repo is &gt;5GB; it&#x27;s likely best to visit the link in a browser, then use the &quot;tree&quot; tab to drill down to and download the file(s) of interest. Full emacs sources are pushed as emacs-28.0.91-src.zip.
 TIA for any feedback and especially reports of breakage, doubly so if you can take the time to send minimal reproducers starting from emacs -Q using &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;M-x report-emacs-bug.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am currently working through a purescript book and really enjoying everything I’m learning! I’m currently working through implementing stock Prelude functions. Apply and flip were easy enough to understand:
 apply :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b apply f x &#x3D; f x
 flip :: forall a b c. (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c flip f x y &#x3D; f y x
 Now, for the implementation of applyFlipped, the book implements it as:
 applyFlipped :: forall a b. a -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; b applyFlipped &#x3D; flip apply
 So from my understanding, applyFlipped accepts two arguments: a parameter of type a, and a function that accepts a parameter of type a and returns a parameter of type b. Because purescript is implicitly right-associative, that would mean that the function with explicit parameters would read:
 applyFlipped x f &#x3D; (flip (apply x f))
 My question is: why does the compiler interpret this as flip with parameters apply, x, and f, rather than interpreting it as apply with parameters x and f (which wouldn’t compile), whose result is a parameter for flip?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen it twice. Both times at financial firms that chose to rewrite entire Scala systems to C++.
 Firm #1 (smaller) decided that it&#x27;s too hard to hire people who knows Scala, and it was hard for other non-FP engineers to understand Scala code.
 Firm #2 (larger) prototyped, then deployed, a trading system in Scala. Once volume picked up, the decision was made to rewrite to C++ for performance reasons. It was blamed on &quot;idiomatic&quot; Scala which I presume was heavy on immutable data structures.
 So I just wanted to get a lay of the land, have ya&#x27;ll seen this happen at your companies? Is it common for a rewrite to happen at a certain point in a project&#x27;s maturity, or have I just been unlucky?

 While trying to evaluate an expression in a debug session I get the following error
 &quot;Cannot evaluate because of java.lang.Exception: Missing evaluator for this debug session.&quot;
 I googled it but found no solution or hints whatsoever.
 Here is my launch.json,

 anyone know the fix?

                              <span>Org Roam is marketed as a &quot;second brain&quot; of non-hierarchical compendium of a user&#x27;s knowledge. This got me wondering if anyone tried working on a project around building an AI to read through their own org roam database and turning it into an artificial second brain that does something useful or synthesizes the knowledge in some way?

                              <span>Hi!
 I am new at Emacs and I want to use it for Rust development,as the title says, but I&#x27;m actually confused with so many options, I read a bit about rustic and it seems very cool, actually I use vscodium for rust because of the extensions that I need and some features (code completion,inline docs and type showing), after that I also want to freeze the package versions for some personal reasons &#x3D;)
 I just want those features that I already have in the vscodium, i love Emacs and the way that it&#x27;s extensible! (sorry ,English is not my mother tongue).
 ​
 Thank you guys!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 So I managed to get majority of what I think my emacs config should look like up and running. Still tweaking things for modern web development (react, ts, etc etc)..
 One thing I miss the most about vim/neovim was telescope and fuzzy finding. Is there a way to have this functionality in emacs? I messed around with counsel-fzf but what I got was fuzzy-finding in the current directory rather than the entire project.. 
 I am trying out helm now and I keep running into this annoying issue when trying to use helm-fuzzy-find. Am I doing things right? Any suggestions on getting fuzzy finding working in emacs where whenever I trigger it, it searches the root project directory??
 ​
 THANKS!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m new to emacs and I&#x27;m having some trouble installing a package. 
 I have the following lines in my .emacs file and the second package doesn&#x27;t work.
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/extensions/emacs-nav-49&quot;) (require &#x27;nav) (nav-disable-overeager-window-splitting) (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/extensions/canvas-emacs-master&quot;) (require &#x27;canvas-utils) (setq canvas-baseurl &quot;my-uni&quot;) (setq canvas-token &quot;your-canvas-token&quot;) 
 However, if I switch the order of them
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/extensions/canvas-emacs-master&quot;) (require &#x27;canvas-utils) (setq canvas-baseurl &quot;my-uni&quot;) (setq canvas-token &quot;your-canvas-token&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/extensions/emacs-nav-49&quot;) (require &#x27;nav) (nav-disable-overeager-window-splitting) (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) 
 nav stops working, so I assume that something is wrong with the code regarding the second package. Can somebody who is more experienced see if I&#x27;m doing anything wrong or does the fault lie with the package itself?

 I run commands via org-babel and tramp which works like a treat. However, those commands do not appear in any shell-history-file of the remote host, obviously. How can I configure tramp, so that the commands run via org-babel are retained in the remote&#x27;s shell-history, so that one can comprehend, what has been done in a previous session?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Since I switched my persistant scratch to org-mode, my emacs startup time went from less than 1 second to more than 5 seconds.
 With benchmark-init, I found out that the problem comes from org-modules, mostly ol-gnus that takes more than 3 seconds to load.
 Knowing that, as I don&#x27;t use and don&#x27;t plan to ever use gnus, eww, or most of the other ol-* things loaded, I want to disable all of them.
 I tried to customize-variable org-modules or (setq org-modules nil) with use-package in :init, :config, :preface, :custom, each separatly or all at the same time, but nothing does the job, I alway have the same default org-modules loaded including ol-gnus and all the others. I also tried with (setq org-modules (delq &#x27;org-gnus org-modules)) as I found in someone&#x27;s config, or setting a minimal list with (setq org-modules &#x27;(org-id ol-info org-protocol)), 
 Do somebody have an idea of how to disable some or all org-modules to load ? Thanks.
 I&#x27;m using emacs 27.2 with build-in org 9.4.4.
 Just to prevent some answers, I don&#x27;t want to use emacsclient or doom to speedup my startup time, I just want to understand why I can&#x27;t set org-modules the way I want.

                              <span>hi everyone, I&#x27;m trying to set up lsp for rust. I installed the lsp-mode and rust-mode packages, and now I need the rust server, rust-analyzer. Following this guide https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#rust-analyzer-language-server-binary, I cloned the repo and ran the command 
 cargo xtask install --server 
 but I get this error and I can&#x27;t figure out how to fix this: 
 error: failed to load manifest for workspace member &#x60;C:\Users\filip\rust-analyzer\xtask&#x60; Caused by: failed to parse manifest at &#x60;C:\Users\filip\rust-analyzer\xtask\Cargo.toml&#x60; Caused by: feature &#x60;edition2021&#x60; is required this Cargo does not support nightly features, but if you switch to nightly channel you can add &#x60;cargo-features &#x3D; [&quot;edition2021&quot;]&#x60; to enable this feature 
 how do I fix this and install rust-analyzer? (edited)

                              <span>i really like the hydra package i use it all the time, but whenever i run hydras and hold a key emacs hangs for 3 seconds or so, is this a problem of hydra or this is just my emacs config??
 i dont have any hydra configuration whatsoever, i use defhydra macro to define hydras.
 most of my hydras look like this one :
 (defhydra hydra-window (:color pink)

 Regardless of what IDE I use (VS code or Intellij) even though I have Scala 3 sources jar attached to the code (see config below) still some of the Scala api definition (e.g. &#x27;sliding&#x27;) takes me to the Scala 2.13.6 sources where I expect it to take me to the Scala 3 sources, why is that happening?
 ​
 config:
 &quot;path&quot;: &quot;C:\\....\\Local\\Coursier\\Cache\\v1\\https\\repo1.maven.org\\maven2\\org\\scala-lang\\scala3-library_3\\3.1.0\\scala3-library_3-3.1.0-sources.jar&quot;

 Thanks.

                              <span>When I wrote a reactive application in scala, I used Monix&#x27;s observables and tasks. So the Task IO was basically hard-coded, then I learned about tagless final. Then I learned also there is an alternative called ZIO that exists.
 Questions:
 Does tagless final even make sense in a reactive application where you&#x27;re mostly using the stream/observable types and not an IO? Since there is no standard type class like Cats IO for streaming, I&#x27;m guessing not?
 How does writing a reactive app in ZIO vs Monix compare? What are the abstractions in ZIO for reactive and how do they compare to the observable?

 Use case: I want to schedule something to a day on which I have free time / nothing scheduled / no deadlines yet. Ideally I not just want to change the appearance of the days (as done in other posts here), but really see a list of all the entries.
 Or, based on this related question: https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/ihzu9g/enhance_calendar_mark_days_with/, is there a way to use calfw-org as date picker?

                              <span>So for the purposes of my final year project I&#x27;m writing a non-deterministic language by Haskell for the purposes of learning Haskell and to understand language design! Non-determinism in the language arises in the presence of control flow for example : n :&#x3D; 0 Do (n  if P.x -&gt; S [] Q.x -&gt; R fi Od So if any of the guards (P.x,Q.x) are True then their statements S,R can be carried out. The caveat here however is that both of the guards could be evaluated to True which means both statements have to be executed. The branch taken that finishes first however is the branch which ultimately gives the final result so for example if the two guards where checking if n is an even number and if n was less than say five then both branches would have to be taken. ​ After just completing a class on Parallel Computing, my first thought was to use threads but then I came across numerous articles and blogs about how the List Monad can handle non-determinism. ​ So my two approaches where to either use threads which I do have some experience with or to see if the List Monad could actually work. I&#x27;m inclined to use threads given that each branch obtains its own instance of the program therefore it would make sense to use them but I am quite aware that Haskell‍ is more or less magic so I figured there&#x27;s probably another way to achieve the effect I desire. ​ Could something along the lines Lisp&#x27;s amb be of any use? I found the Haskell implementation https://wiki.haskell.org/Amb but it appears to generally be used for more trivial programs than anything else. ​ My apologies if this post isn&#x27;t allowed, was just looking to rubberduck a bit

 I am going to take my final course at my University and for the project I decided to create a simple theorem prover that my professor provided the full Syntax rules (expressions, operator precedence, keyords, etc.). Should I use Happy &amp; Alex or Parsec?
 I would like to keep maintaining the language that I create.

                              <span>Hi, I was looking at functional programming for months, and I was studying haskell in particular. I can see how preventing mutation and side effects helps increasing the correctness of the program especially in parallel and concurrent programming. But I wonder how this affects the performance of the program in terms of space and time?

                              <span>Dear Haskellers, there&#x27;s some neat behavior of GHCI that I&#x27;ve discovered by accident and I&#x27;ve grown to take advantage of it quite a bit and I realized that it&#x27;s probably not common knowledge, since I don&#x27;t ever remember anyone mentioning it, so I&#x27;ve decided to mention it myself.
 As you know, when you :reload in GHCI, it only reloads the modules that have changed (themselves or their dependecies, modulo unnecessary TemplateHaskell reloads) since the last :reload. What I&#x27;ve noticed is that when a module doesn&#x27;t get reloaded, it gets to keep the value of any top-level IORefs too (the value of anything really)! 
 Here&#x27;s an example of how I&#x27;ve been using this feature; Say I have a Server.DevServer module that imports most of the project and sets up an environment that enables serving most of t…</span>

                              <span>Title. I&#x27;m not really sure that Comonad is the answer, because it&#x27;s dual on how layers can be transformed. F.e. Monad&#x27;s (join :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a) ,opposed to comonad&#x27;s (duplicate :: Comonad w &#x3D;&gt; w a -&gt; w (w a)) and (return :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; m a) opposed to (extract :: Comonad w &#x3D;&gt; w a -&gt; a). Alas, it&#x27;s not about whether the value is stored, like in a covariant functor, or is it consumed, like in a contravariant functor.
 Is there any typeclass that allowes this: cobind :: Contramonad c &#x3D;&gt; c b -&gt; (a -&gt; c b) -&gt; c a ?
 And is (would have been) it usefull? I&#x27;m asking from theoretical point of view + I&#x27;m curious (mostly curious, I don&#x27;t know much category theory).
 UPD: upon writing this, I wrote the following piece of code, that typechecks
 (&gt;&gt;~) :: (Contravariant w, Comonad w) &#x3D;&gt; w b -&gt; (a -&gt; w b) -&gt; w a wb &gt;&gt;~ f &#x3D; contramap f $ duplicate wb 
 My own question answered by myself, I guess? The answer is (Comonad + Contravariant).
 UPD: as the wise man in the comments said, no type constructor, that is both Comonad and Contravariant, is inhabited, so my solution is kinda useless.

 Helloo. I am terribly sorry if this is a common knowledge, but I have been unable to find an answer to this question of mine. What I want to achieve is stopping infinite recursion started by a thread, on a timeout. I tried using System.Timeout.timeout, too, and it didn&#x27;t help. After a bit of googling I found out that recursion can be optimized in such a way that thread in question never yields, so I tried compiling with -fno-omit-yields, and it didn&#x27;t do anything. I also am compiling with -threaded.

                              <span>Hi guys, finish you know of any good github sample apps, written in scala, in proper functional style ? the ⠀goal is to see actual production code that is FP worthy, to look up to :) I am looking to see how FP looks in practice similar to https://github.com/pauljamescleary/scala-pet-store or https://github.com/hcwilhelm/twm I have 2 years of scala experience, mostly akka tech stack, and some basic cats knowledge. Thanks Mircea

                              <span>I have been coding Haskell for years but (I am very ashamed to admit) I still don&#x27;t quite get what&#x27;s so great about laziness.
 I look at laziness only as a nice-to-have trick where I occasionally do something like indexedBoom &#x3D; zip boom [0..], but that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t quite get what&#x27;s so PROFOUND about laziness.
 I&#x27;m sure there are many things in Haskell that I use all the time that not only utilize laziness but simply would not be possible at all without laziness, but I don&#x27;t quite grasp what those things are.

                              <span>The Core Libraries Committee is seeking for a new member! We are grateful to George Wilson, who steps down after three years of hard work, and are looking for someone to take his seat.
 Who should apply?
 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
 Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
  Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month).
  Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
  Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.
  
We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.
 Candidates, who stand for CLC Elections back in September, are most welcome to apply again.
 How can I apply?
 To apply for one of these positions, send an email to core-libraries-committee@haskell.org that consists of the following data:
  
 The header &quot;CLC Election January 2022 - {your name}&quot;.
  Why you think you’re a good fit given the above criteria.
  If applicable, please point us to some code you’ve written.
  
Please apply before Feb 1.

                              <span>Happstack seems a well maintained and fully featured, well-documented platform for web apps of various kinds but I don&#x27;t see people talking about using it or recommending it when others ask what to use. That seems more likely to be servant, scotty or (less often?) Yesod. Am I right in thinking this and, if so, why is it? 
 I should say I&#x27;ve not used any of these frameworks in production. I have some teaching materials based on Happstack that I&#x27;d be happy to migrate if there are good technical reasons, otherwise I&#x27;ll leave well alone.

                              <span>I am trying to create buttons in a pos-tip window, created with the function pos-tip-show-no-propertize.
 This should be possible, as company-quickhelp is using exactly this function to display the temporary help, and in its popup window, I can select text, click buttons, and so on. On the other hand, when trying to replicate this behaviour, its as if the pos-tip window was &quot;floating&quot; above the rest, and I am not able to interact with it. The text is correctly fontified as far as colours, weight, slant ... are concerned, but I can&#x27;t seem to get my mouse to &quot;interact&quot; with it. 
 As an example, here is a (toy) example that does not work (i.e. I can&#x27;t click on the links) while using company+company-quickhelp and completing the symbol while shows exactly the same text ... except that the buttons actually are clickable: 
 (let* ((help-buffer (describe-symbol &#x27;while)) (text (with-current-buffer &quot;*Help*&quot; (buffer-string)))) (pos-tip-show-no-propertize text nil nil nil 5 600 600)) 
 I&#x27;ve spent quite some time reading the company-quickhelp and company-capf documentation, and I can&#x27;t understand what they are doing that I am not doing.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 in my journey to my optimized emacs configuration for Python development, I&#x27;m now working with cells, on two main tasks:
 (1) change default regexp expression for boundary to &quot;#%%&quot;
 (2) highlight the current cell (defined now with &quot;#%%&quot; boundaries) in which the cursor is in, with a different color than background
 I&#x27;m unfortunately stuck for those two tasks and would much appreciate any tips... Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

                              <span>Over the years of being a middlingly-talented web developer, I&#x27;ve learned a dislike of spaces in file names.  I know they are valid in filenames, and are at least addressed in URLs/URIs, but they seem to add just a little fragility to what is otherwise pretty solid without spaces.
I&#x27;m about to embrace wholeheartedly the community&#x27;s recommendation of a unique ID in the filename, followed by the plain English name.  I see the automation benefits of having the (Markdown) h1 in the Zettel being the same as the file name, so that leans me towards accepting spaces.  But one of my goals here is a pretty rigorous future proofing, portability, and stability.
Have you all given this some thought and decided that spaces in file names are just not a problem at all?  If so, my set of files are still small enough that I can swap strategies.
Thank you for any advice you can give.</span>
