                              <span>The context here is, I&#x27;m working in a company environment that is using https://trunk.io in its dev environment, which is kind of a meta-linter for many languages. It wraps a bunch of backend lint tools and combines their results, and enforces a company wide policy on all of them. They provide integrations for a few IDEs, but nothing specific to emacs yet. What they do provide is an LSP proxy to their tool. I have been looking if there is any support in flymake or flycheck to use a generic LSP server as the checker backend, and I haven&#x27;t found anything. Does anyone know if this is possible? Or if there&#x27;s an existing backend that&#x27;s close enough that could be tweaked to do this? I&#x27;ve attempted to duplicate the trunk configuration using individual flymake backends, and the maintenance is just too much. It would be way easier to just make use of the tool directly.

                              <span>By forward function declarations I mean what is needed when a function defined later in the file is called from a preceding one.
 By circular I mean file A requires a function in file B which requires a function in file A. Something along those lines
 PS. Apologies for inquiring about this again. I am sure I enquired sometime in the past and forgotten the actual question and the response to it.

 I was surprised to see Emacs on wayland was running slower than its counterpart on Xwayland. Also the fonts issue was not fixed.
 While zooming in makes the fonts look better. On X i don&#x27;t have this issue.

                              <span>If I understand it right, goto-last-change should go to the places where I made the last edits. But often, when I want to go back, it seems to have &quot;forgotten&quot; them, jumps to a very old edit, and then displays &quot;No further change info&quot; in the minibuffer.
 I just had the problem again. I made sure the edits are very far away, many lines in the same org-buffer. Neither goto-last-change-reverse nor goto-last-change does find them. But when I use undo-redo, all my &quot;forgotten&quot; edits are found and subsequently undone. How can that be?
 Do you use a different function for going back to the last edits? Or am I using goto-last-change in a wrong way? The variable glc-default-span is set to 8, and I am using Org mode version 9.6.9 and Emacs 29.1. Thank you for any advice!
 Edit: I also use undo-fu-session, could it be that this interferes with goto-last-change?

 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-q&quot;) &#x27;cmd) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-Q&quot; | &quot;C-S-q&quot; | &quot;C-S-Q&quot; | &quot;C-\S-q&quot; | &quot;C-\S-Q&quot; | ...) &#x27;cmd-2) 
 and swapping the lines.
 I never manage to get the intended behaviour – it keeps translating the uppercase to lowercase or vice-versa. And sometimes it doesn&#x27;t – there seems to be no pattern.
 Could someone help me out?

                              <span>I&#x27;m losing my mind over emacs as a python IDE. It seems that no matter which LSP concept I attempt, the experience is suboptimal. At best it is riddled with odd issues, and at worst almost bordering unusable.
 I work as a python developer, and I work on quite large code bases. The LSP experience is essential for me given the complexity, but I&#x27;m at the point of giving up, even though I&#x27;ve been an emacs user for the better part of a decade.
 I use doom emacs, by the way, but I&#x27;m quite happy to try anything to solve this. I have considered to build an emacs config from scratch again to see if I can narrow down the experience, but right now I have not invested the time. But again, considering how frustrated and desparate I am, everything is on the table.

 I wonder if there is any similar package or eglot configuration to replicate what Error Lens does in vscode? Thank you in advance.
 My config looks as follows, I&#x27;d kindly appreciate any suggestion that could help me to improve my eglot experience:
 (use-package! eglot :defer t :init (setq eglot-autoshutdown t) :config (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilities &#x27;(:hoverProvider :documentLinkProvider :inlayHintProvider :documentOnTypeFormattingProvider)) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(rust-mode &quot;rust-analyzer&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(scala-mode &quot;metals&quot;)) (add-hook &#x27;eglot-managed-mode-hook (lambda () (flymake-mode -1))) :hook ((rjsx-mode rust-mode typescript-mode js2-mode scala-mode) . eglot-ensure))

                              <span>Monoid is a monoid in Hask (-&gt;), with a unit () and a pair as the tensor.
 Moniod &#x3D; MonoidalOf (-&gt;) () (,) 
 It is famous that Monad is a monoid in the (~&gt;) category
  
&quot;A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, ..&quot;
  
with the Identity functor as unit and functor composition as a tensor.
 What is less well-known is that Applicative is a similar monoid with a different tensor.
 Monad &#x3D; MonoidalOf (~&gt;) Identity Compose Applicative &#x3D; MonoidalOf (~&gt;) Identity Day 
 These are explained in &quot;Notions of Computation as Monoids&quot;: https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/pubs/Notions_of_Computation_as_Monoids.pdf.
 Here is a compilation I have made of other monoid typeclasses, I haven&#x27;t seen a more complete list elsewhere. I put the focus on structuring them clearly to elucidate the pattern.

                              <span>I tried looking at org-ql and found it to be a little overcomplicated for my more limited use cases.
 I felt like something simpler should exist, so I&#x27;m thinking of creating a mini query language that can be used to reference specific notes.
 Some examples:
 mynotes.org/0 -- grab first note in mynotes.org, a file in the current directory.
 /0/0 - grab first note of the first note of the current file.
 ../sibling note -- subnote of parent of current note with title &quot;sibling note&quot;.
 /0/0/1 -- relative to current file, 2nd note of the first subnote of the first subnote.
 ./0/1 -- 2nd subnote of the first subnote relative to current note.
 ../0/0 -- 1st subnote of the first subnote relative to the 
 The query function would have &quot;find one&quot; and &quot;find all&quot; functions. find one would fail if there were 0 or 2+ results.
 This query language would be focused around the following needs:
  
Ability to straightforwardly pass a reference to a note from one command line app that reads org mode to another.
 Ability to programmatically reference one note from another by relative or absolute location. There are some command line applications I&#x27;d like to build around org mode which would need something like this.
 Simplicity. I could add all sorts of bells and whistles to this but it would overburden it.
  
The other idea I had was to just use xpath but apply it to org mode. xpath is well known but I think it&#x27;s not so well liked, and the above queries would be possible but a lot more gnarly.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Bad idea?

 I posted this benchmark in the rust and golang subreddits some time ago and the community made suggestions that sped up the code...so I thought it&#x27;d be fair to post it here to get some feedback.

                              <span>I came across an issue using Emacs when switching to a wayland compositor (hyprland).
 The fonts don&#x27;t look right as you can see at the screenshot below, but zooming in makes it better.
 My current emacs build is using LUCID no PGTK.
 I&#x27;m thinking of building another Emacs build with PGTK support that runs natively on Wayland without Xwayland. However i&#x27;d like to install them both.
 As i use Lucid version on XMonad most the time, but still when i switching to wayland i could still have a better font.

 Do recommend your favourites!
 So far I&#x27;ve seen:
 ​
  
the port of the VScode Synthwave &#x27;84 theme - though: 
 not noob friendly as it&#x27;s not in doom-themes
 seems to not have the extra-cool glow effect (no idea how to achieve that on emacs)
 
 the doom-themes port of laserwave
  
Any others I should consider?

 for such lines, unless I either rewrite it more verbosely as
 (cl-check-type &#x27;(a b) (satisfies proper-list-p)) 
 or provide an explicit type definition
 (cl-deftype proper-list () &#x27;(satisfies proper-list-p)) 
 Is anyone aware, if this is intended behavior?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a noob (of nearly 3 years using emacs).
 Buffer / window management still confuses me.
 I haven&#x27;t really learned to use / position / switch windows and buffers. Simply because I used to one org-mode window most of the time.
 Now I&#x27;m using org-roam, amd dealing with multiple small files, I keep getting stuck in silly situations, like ending up with:
  
a roam buffer and my fallback buffer vertically stacked - when I want to &quot;fullscreen&quot; the window with the roam buffer, I can&#x27;t delete or kill the fallback window / buffer.
 
two fallback buffers vertically stacked. Neither of which I can kill or delete.
 
 Is there a good guide somewhere?

                              <span>Just in case someone else also stumbles over this: Somewhere between 27.1 and 29.1, the behavior of format-spec has changed, when the substitution is a symbol.
 Prior to upgrading to from 27.1 to 29.1, invocations
 (format-spec &quot;Hello %a!&quot; &#x27;((a . world))) 
 would evaluate to the string
 &quot;Hello world!&quot; 
 As of 29.1, the behavior depends on whether a function is bound to world: If no function is bound to world&#x27;, the same result as in 27.1 will be obtained, but if a function is bound toworld&#x27;, it will be invoked without arguments, and the return value will be used instead of the symbol name.
 This has bitten me in my &#x60;.emacs&#x27;, where I had code using 
 (format-spec &quot;[...] &#x60;%s-p&#x27; [...]&quot; &#x60;(... (?s . ,type-name) ...)) 
 to generate a doc-string, and got an unexpected error
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (1 . 1) 0) 
 upon start-up, due to a function some-type-p being called without arguments under the new behavior, instead of interpolating it as symbol-name.
 Order of execution
 This was especially confusing, due to the introduction of a dependence on the order of execution. E.g. create a file /tmp/test.el with contents 
 ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*- (format-spec &quot;Hello %s!&quot; &#x27;((?s . foo-p))) (defun foo-p (obj) t) (princ &quot;Done.\n&quot;) 
 then 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el Done. 
 but
 &gt;&gt;&gt; emacs --batch --load /tmp/test.el --load /tmp/test.el Wrong number of arguments: ((t) (obj) t), 0 Done. Error: wrong-number-of-arguments (((t) (obj) t) 0) mapbacktrace(#f(compiled-function (evald func args flags) #)) debug-early-backtrace() debug-early(error (wrong-number-of-arguments ((t) (obj) t) 0)) foo-p() format-spec(&quot;Hello %s!&quot; ((115 . foo-p))) eval-buffer(# nil &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) load(&quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; nil t) command-line-1((&quot;--load&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot; &quot;--load&quot; &quot;/tmp/test.el&quot;)) command-line() normal-top-level()

                              <span>Hi
 I managed to setup lsp and java for emacs. I can compile and all works fine.
 I set compile command in init.el to run javac and java command so I see the result, as below.
 (setq compile-command &quot;javac YourJavaFileName.java &amp;&amp; java YourJavaClass&quot;)
 For now I have to replace &quot;YourJavaClass&quot; with current class. Can anyone help me to automatically pass currently opened class name to that command, please?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Is there some way to make visual-line-mode more smart about line-breaks? As depicted in fig.1, visual-line-mode doesn&#x27;t really handle overly-long lines (e.g. due to URLs) well. Disabling it entirely makes a bad overall trade-off in files containing mostly textual lines (fig.2).
 It could improve by allowing line-breaks on some non-whitespace characters (like &quot;-&quot; or &quot;/&quot;) or simply disabling visual-line-mode entirely for &quot;words&quot; that anyway need more than one line. Better yet, for any word exceeding a maximum character-length (e.g. 50) in order to better handle lines containing a few words, but also a moderately long URL (e.g. when using the markdown syntax [link name](link url)).
 I&#x27;ve found no existing options in the M-x customize interface, nor any relevant packages in M-x package-list-packages (including MELPA).
 Fig.1 When breaking long \&quot;words\&quot; like URLs, visual-line-mode is not very smart about where to break the lines.
 Fig.2 For URLs, having no visual-line-mode line breaks active would be preferable, but the disadvantage of disabling visual-line-mode for lines with actual text is too big to just disable visual-line-mode entirely.

                              <span>I do use desktop-mode to restore my tab and window layouts and loaded buffers. I also switch workplaces regulary and use different monitor layouts with different scaling factors.
 It would be great to use dekstop save mode without saving/restoring frame postion and size.
 I am aware of desktop-restore-frames but unlike it&#x27;s name, at least on Emacs 29, setting this to #f also doesn&#x27;t restore tab configuration and window layouts what I don&#x27;t want.

 I suppose I can write a scraper and dump content in json format. I&#x27;d prefer a plaintext format like org-mode and was designed with some thought put into this, instead of me cobbling something together.

 Erules is a lightweight, simple, and functional Scala library for rule evaluation. In this article, we will explore how to use this library to define and evaluate rules efficiently. Follow step-by-step for a detailed and hands-on understanding of use cases.
 What is Erules?
 Erules is a library that provides a rule evaluation engine in Scala. It is designed to be straightforward, typed, and functional, leveraging the power of Cats core. With Erules, you can define rules clearly and evaluate them on various data types concisely.
 Step 1: Import the Library
 To get started, add Erules as a dependency to your Scala project. You can do this in the build.sbt file with the following declaration:

 My goal was to show how to use various building blocks from ZIO framework to build and test a fully functional streaming application which broadcasts Kafka messages over web sockets.

                              <span>Using optparse-applicative I&#x27;m trying construct a parser that collects everything after the first argument into a list of strings. My goal is to write a tool that wraps another tool, adding a few commands and passing all unknown commands on.
 I&#x27;d hoped to find that strArgument would take anything and turn it into a string, i.e. that something like this would work:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; main :: IO () main &#x3D; do execParser optParser &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print
 data Opts &#x3D; OptFoo String [String] deriving (Show)
 optParser &#x3D; info (fall  helper) fullDesc where fall &#x3D; OptFoo  strArgument (metavar &quot;CMD&quot;  help &quot;git command&quot;)  many (strArgument mempty) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It works nicely for ordinary arguments:
  ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly OptFoo &quot;baz&quot; [&quot;silly&quot;] 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work with options
 &#x60;&#x60; ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly foo --bar Invalid option--bar&#x27;
 Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and it also picks up --help
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ❯ cabal exec test -- baz silly --help Usage: optparse-applicative-tst CMD
 Available options: CMD git command -h,--help Show this help text &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I suspect optparse-applicative simply wasn&#x27;t written with this use case in mind and I&#x27;m failing to see any way of writing such a parser. Is there a way to do this using optparse-applicative, or should I look at other option/argument parsing packages?

                              <span>tl;dr - see Question below
 Background / my setup
 So I&#x27;ve used a GTD-like setup in org-mode for a few years now. I&#x27;m very much still a noob.
 One thing I feel is slowing me down, particularly at weekly reveiw, is needing to duplicate project headings for tasks (or maybe I&#x27;m making a fundamental mistake in my workflow).
 For example, I&#x27;d write something like the below and need to type &quot;Big/Small Important Work Project&quot; a number of times with my big fat fingers:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ** Big Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Big Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 5th floor for meeting about Big Important Work Project
 ** Small Important Work Project
 *** TODO: email Amit for stats on Small Important Work Project :computer:
 *** TODO: book room on 4th floor for meeting about Small Important Work Project
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (Note, I don&#x27;t actually use TODO keywords, except DONE)
 In org mode I can simply use folding to see what project the task is for, however, my reminders are either in Orgzly (agenda widget), or via tasker popups on my phone 
 I therefore get tasks like &quot;call amit&quot; or &quot;book room&quot; a lot, devoid of context.
 Question:
 Is there a way the a project (X-level) heading can be inherited by its children? Maybe appended to them?
 I realise this is not nessecarily an Org, or emacs, problem but I hope I can solve it programatically in emacs.

                              <span>For those interested, I just released orgmunge version 0.2.0 (GitHub, PyPi). This version will attempt to parse the TODO keywords specified in the input file/text if they exist; otherwise, it lets you flexibly specify the TODO keywords as an argument to the parser or via a local file.

                              <span>I read the documentation of using MTL library but I would love some more examples to work this through. Say that I have Haskell code looking like:
 haskell foo :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; State Int () foo global local | local &gt;&#x3D; 10 &#x3D; put 100 | otherwise &#x3D; do if (ord local) &#x60;elem&#x60; global then do put (local) foo global (local + 1) else do return () 
 Note: This program means absolutely nothing. This is a very basic structure of a program I am working on. As you see that the first parameter is a read-only global variable which I wish to abstract out in a Reader monad. I know I have to work with StateT.
  newType State s m a &#x3D; State { runStateT :: (s -&gt; m (s, a)) } -- where m is the inner monad 
 My understanding is that I should change my function signature to:
  foo :: Int -&gt; StateT Int (Reader String ()) foo &#x3D; undefined -- I don&#x27;t know how to implement this 
 Can someone please help me with this?

                              <span>How do I use the fixed-pitch font for math fragments in org-mode buffers? I.e., I want to use a monospace font for all strings of the form \(...\) or \[...\], where ... may include newline characters as well, as is common for equations written in math display mode. 
 I&#x27;m an Emacs newb, so the best I could come up with was a regex-based font-lock:
 (progn (setq-local font-lock-keywords &#x60;((,(rx (group (or &quot;\\[&quot; &quot;\\(&quot;) (zero-or-more anything) (or &quot;\\]&quot; &quot;\\)&quot;))) (1 &#x27;fixed-pitch)))) (font-lock-fontify-buffer)) 
 And then running this on an org-mode-hook.
 But this is definitely wrong. Not only does it remove all the nice org-mode styling applied to things like section headers, but it&#x27;s also applying the fixed-pitch font to more than just the intended math fragments, suggesting issues with the regex at least.

 - transient menus
 - asynchronous process calls
 Overall: more accessible a much faster, less resource intensive. Thanks for all feedback in the last days, that helped me bring it forward!

 idk what these icons symbolise i don&#x27;t want any lavish gif as icons but these icons just don&#x27;t make sense to me is there any font pack i have to modify or do i have to modify any icons file contents
 i want to patch this issue i&#x27;m just annoyed with this issue at this point i have been using this since last two years i didn&#x27;t care much to resolve this but now it&#x27;s just annoying
 i did nerd-icons-install-fonts to install fonts in my computer i even did something else to set fonts i don&#x27;t remember what it was

                              <span>Eglot is a lot more bare-bones than lsp-mode – leaving &#x27;UI chrome&#x27; to external packages that can work generically with emacs&#x27; existing ecosystem (flymake/eldoc/etc.) – and this generally works for me. Making similar migrations in my config has worked out very well – notably to use vertico family of packages for completions.
 Are there packages you like that provide additional chrome on what eglot makes available? I&#x27;m particularly interested in project diagnostics from flymake, but I&#x27;m curious to see what else folks have come across.

                              <span>Is there some package in Emacs, that works as a web server, that can be used for testing the project, that you are currently working on?
 For example, I have a project folder, that&#x27;s currently opened in Emacs with html, css and js files is there a package, that will run a web server on the project&#x27;s working path.
 I mean, it&#x27;s possible to just open files on the web browser, but, there are situations in HTML5, that are prohibited without using web server, i.e. AJAX and WebSocket and some other technologies. Also, if you use local version (not the web server), you cannot use absolute paths to files in the project, because they will differ from those on the web server.

 I would like to be able to click, or use some hot key, while cursor being over urls, in this case: &quot;style.css&quot;, &quot;script.js&quot; and &quot;page2.html&quot;, and it would open that document for editing or, if the document&#x27;s file doesn&#x27;t exist, it would open an empty file with such name.

 I&#x27;ve tried the built-in functionality but the configuration contains a lot of junk which makes it hard to manage and share between machines.
 With junk I mean information besides configuration such as time last changed.
 Configuration what any configuration is, the individual bookmark with title location and so on.

If it is rare could you explain when you needed to define your own instead of using a combination of the standard ones mentioned above?

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I present to you kickstart.emacs.
 A starting point for Gnu Emacs with good defaults, vim keybindings and packages that most people may want to use without needing to watch hours of tutorial videos to get started.
 One of the project goals is to become something like kickstart.nvim.
 Or, to be a reference if someone doesn&#x27;t know how to do something.
 I would appreciate any feedback.
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>I have this type of code in my init.el each loads the features in a directly and it turns out that because the file names contained the - character they were not being loaded, as the regex checks for only alphanumeric filenames which are not hidden.
 (let ((default-directory (expand-file-name &quot;wsi/lisp&quot; user-emacs-directory))) (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path (directory-files default-directory nil &quot;[^\\.][a-z0-9]*&quot;))) 
 By the way I copied this from someone&#x27;s init.el and I&#x27;ve suffered from it for ages, an object lesson on how one should not copy init.el files and other Emacs lisp code without fully understanding the code in them.
 I&#x27;m not sure but it looks like the regex will not even match file names with capitals in them.
 I guess the question I want to ask is how to add arbitrary non-alphabetical characters to a regex matching alphanumeric characters, with the proviso that they are acceptable in file names..

                              <span>i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need elisp as i&#x27;m using emacs distribution
 i want to learn basics elisp so that i can understand how to map keys how to send commands etc.
 constructs that all beginners require
 please don&#x27;t send a 300 page pdf for elisp as i don&#x27;t want to learn everything i just want a basic max 10 page rulebook for elisp 
 ​
 my teacher told me to use emacs and i love the experience so far thanks to the support from this community
 i have not yet learned how to execute command like 
 menu-bar--display-line-numbers-mode-relative
 i don&#x27;t know how to 
 run tab-width command with and set it to 4 after using M-x to open dialogue box to run command
 (i think it&#x27;s called buffer not dialogue box)
 ​
 so this is the level i&#x27;m at not much i know but i hope that emacs gods help me in finding true peace

 What could be the cause and the fix?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I ve been experimenting with Monads. Then i realized (-&gt; a) is a Monad (that made me so happy and made the monads more accesible somehow ).
 Today i started to play with Comonads. My intuition was like hmm probably (-&gt; * a) is a Comonad. I wasnt sure how to express that in Haskell. Also :i Comonad only showed ((,) e).
 Before giving up though i tried the Comonad functions on types of (-&gt; a)They worked !
 λ&gt;&#x3D; extend (\x -&gt; x [1 ,2 ] ) length [10] 3 it :: Int λ&gt;&#x3D; extract (++[10]) [10] it :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; [a] λ&gt;&#x3D; duplicate (++[10]) [1] [2] [1,2,10] it :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; [a] 
 Could someone explain how it works please?

 https://github.com/emacs-openai/chatgpt
 Just found and installed it and it works great. You only need an API Key from Open AI.

If you use one method for the majority of your searches, but occasionally use another in a few specialized circumstances, please just select the most common one.

                              <span>Could you recommend themes (dark or light) with warm green background? The closest one to what I&#x27;m looking for is Robin Hood. Organic Green, Shaman, and Kingsajz are too blueish for my taste. And most other &quot;green&quot; themes only use green as foreground colour.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have encountered an oddity preventing me from using DooM EMacs on my work Intel MacBook Pro (Linux user at home). 
 I installed Doom EMacs from the official GitHub page using Homebrew emacs-mac package. 
 Conditions:
  
If I open a file using the Mac terminal &#x60;emacs test.org’ then 2 instances of DooM EMacs will instantiate. 1) that is of the document I requested, and 2) a DooM Emacs home screen. 
 
If I click an icon through the Mac finder then all works as expect. 
 
If I create a zsh or bash shell script with emacs test.org and execute then the script will hang.
 
 My .zsh looks as so:  alias emacs&#x3D;&#x27;open /Applications/EMacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs&#x27; 
 Thanks for reading.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been acquainting myself with Emacs (vanilla) and am currently reading through the tutorial. I&#x27;m at the part about creating new frames and, as you can see on the image, the new frame shows up small and squished. This also happens sometimes when opening Emacs regularly. I doubt that is intended. I have not found any topics related to this behaviour (maybe my google-fu is just bad). Anyone encounter this before and have a potential fix? I don&#x27;t have an init file yet and I&#x27;m on Fedora if that helps.
 Edit: Just now realised reddit didn&#x27;t include the image, don&#x27;t know how to do it afterwards, but &quot;solved&quot; anyway.

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I decided to learn Org mode recently, and wanted to add some of my custom vim keybindings to Doom emacs, but there are two keybindings i have problem with.
 The first one being with avy where i want to use &quot;s&quot; in normal mode to start the search. But this isnt working:
 (map! :after evil :n &quot;s&quot; &#x27;avy-goto-char-2)
 I have similiar syntax with other binds and they work. I added &quot;:after evil&quot; since that was a suggestion in another reddit thread i found
 Another binding i want to add is to make &quot;C-d&quot; act as &quot;C-d-z-z&quot; (I want to have the current functionality of vim/emacs, but center the text when i scroll) Any ideas on how i can achieve this?

                              <span>I have been using Magit and Forge for several years, mainly with projects on self-hosted Gitlab instances. The experience has been great!
 One of the nice things that Forge did for me was showing the numbers of merge requests (in !123 form) in my magit-log views. Some time ago, however, this stopped working. Actually, this stopped working quite some time ago, maybe a year or more. I was too lazy to report it and too busy to investigate. IIRC it didn&#x27;t stop working right away for all repos, so I guess it is not related to e.g. upgrading to Emacs 28 (and it was definitely before I upgraded to Emacs 29.1). 
 To investigate this in more detail, I created new clones of several projects, but that didn&#x27;t change anything. I also tried a simplified Emacs config in a new home directory to make sure that Forge&#x27;s database was created from scratch. Same problem persists. 
 On Forge&#x27;s Github pages, I found some references to interactions of Forge with bug-reference-mode, so maybe it somehow has to do with that? On the other hand, given that I used a fresh Emacs config + new clones, I guess this isn&#x27;t the cause of the issue either. 
 Does anyone know how to get the MR numbers back in Magit&#x27;s log view?

How do I move them all at once to that top level directory for easier management/renaming? I don&#x27;t want to have to go into each directory and move them one at a time with R. Let&#x27;s say all of the files are MP4 or HEVC.

                              <span>I am a Neovim user, and I am trying out Emacs.
 I recently started with doom emacs, it feels pretty good. However, one issue I am facing is that pyright works very slow. I know that it is an issue with pyright, which I faced with Neovim also.
 However, I made it faster for my use-case by changing some settings. Neovim allows to have these settings in the setup function for LSP. I was trying to figure out how do I change these settings with doom emacs. Pyright docs suggest to have these settings in pyrightconfig.json.
 I think this is more of a pyright issue, but feel like somebody might have already solved it.

 PlantUML works as expected when generating images, for instance:
 :file *.png
 The problem is, there is no ASCII generated in results: verbatim mode:
 :results verbatim
 png generated in RESULTS instead of expected ASCII text. What could go wrong?
 The same problem observed here: https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/problem-with-plantuml-src-block-results/3603
 According to this article:
 https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-plantuml.html
 there seems to be no reason why this should not work.
 UPDATE:
 The docs appear to be somewhat outdated or smth is not correctly setup. I&#x27;ve found that specifying a :file .txt actually allows to generate ASCII in a text file. The only question is: how to preview it in the org-mode now? 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 +begin_src plantuml :file ascii.txt
 Bob -&gt; Alice : Hello World!
 +end_src
 +RESULTS:
 [[file:ascii.txt]]

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been given a budget to upgrade/swap my M2 Air laptop, but I wonder what the actual productivity gain will I get if I spend it on M3 Max straight away. I use parallel compilation in Cabal and Nix, and I split my projects into smaller sub-packages already, and unless I get a decent compilation time improvement for M3 Max over M2, I&#x27;d prefer keeping a lighter and smaller M2 Air for now and maybe wait for another iteration.
 Has anyone been lucky to test that new chip in a compilation-heavy environment already?

                              <span>A recent post got me thinking about how we might go about extracting nested optional values with the convenience of Kotlin and TypeScript, but while still leveraging Scala&#x27;s rich monadic types. Odersky&#x27;s comment on another post indicated a way to reproduce a version of the ? syntax using Scala&#x27;s boundary/break. His example works only with A | Null values, however. I wanted to see if I could accomplish the same while:
  
Supporting ? on any optional/failable type,
 Preserving failure types by returning an Either and tracking any failure types encountered in the get chain, and
 Still avoid any intermediate allocations (only construct the Either at the end)
  
You can see my attempt in this gist
 The syntax is:
 val result: Either[F1 | F2 | F3, A] &#x3D; getEither(obj1.?.obj2.?.obj3) 
 Where F1, F2, and F3 are the failure types of obj1, obj2, and obj3. Option fails with Unit, Try fails with Throwable, and Either fails with its left type.
 I&#x27;m doubtful I&#x27;d ever actually use this: having to a) import &#x60;getEither&#x60; and &#x60;?&#x60;, b) wrap the statement in &#x60;getEither&#x60;, and c) add a dot before each &#x60;?&#x60; seems like just a little more would make me skip the usual syntax, but it was fun and interesting to work out how to do it. I&#x27;d be curious to hear others&#x27; thoughts.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Along similar lines, it occurred to me that you could produce an implementation of Option that has no allocation overhead. You can check out my attempt at that here. It just uses A | Null under the hood as an opaque type. It&#x27;s two limitations that I know of are:
  
toString does not show None or Some(x) but null and x (this is just a limitation of opaque types)
 I can&#x27;t figure out a way to implement exhaustive extractors. Instead, you can use the fold method (which I&#x27;ve been using more and more these days anyways)

                              <span>Hello there .
 I am using as my OS devuan gnu+linux .
 The point is I like philosophy of Unix using like tmux + nvim + mutt .
 and I love the vi keybings so much .. 
 Sometimes I am thinking to switch to gnu emacs .. but I feel that I will find some difficulties
 and I am afraid . 
 Is there a easy way to use emacs ?

I need to collaborate on some notes with a Vim user. It&#x27;d be nice if there were some tools in Vim that they could use to navigate Denote-formatted Markdown files as easily as I can. Does anyone know of a Vim plugin that works with Denote?

                              <span>Hi Everyone.
 I&#x27;m using emacs and ripgrep to find what I&#x27;m looking for in a folder. Ripgrep shows the result of what I&#x27;m looking beautifully. Thats great. Every time I open a result, ripgrep buffer disappears. 
 Does anyone know how to open a temp buffer to view result then I can close it and go back to rg result again, so I don&#x27;t have to type my search query.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Just started using hyperbole and it works great for following links to files, though when I try to follow a url I get an “Invalid regexp” error. Has anyone else experienced this/found a way around it?

                              <span>Is it possible to never list org agenda files from being shown in buffer lists? I have a few buffer open and I open agenda to check something. Now when (while still being in agenda) I do switch buffer among the options I see are the org agenda files. I don’t want that.
 If I ever want to see them I will open them explicitly (not want to see them when they were opened automatically by agenda)

                              <span>I want to be able to use outline-minor-mode to fold my use-package blocks at convenient points. Ideally, I want to be able to fold sections following :config, :init, :custom, etc. as well as definitions inside those blocks. The current value of outline-regexp when in emacs-lisp-mode is: 
 &quot;;;;;* [^ \n]\\|(\\|\\(^;;;###\\(\\([-[:alnum:]]+?\\)-\\)?\\(autoload\\)\\)&quot; 
 I thought appending \\|[[:space:]]*:\\(init|config|custom\\) to this would work, but it doesn&#x27;t. Any help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>When checking the weather for different locations in org-babel, I encountered an issue where the symbol for partly cloudy was not displayed correctly. Here is the code I used: 
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output curl &#x27;wttr.in/{Paris,SanJose,Washington}?format&#x3D;4&#x27; #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: : Paris: 🌧 🌡️+10°C 🌬️↗9km/h : SanJose: ☀️ 🌡️+16°C 🌬️↘15km/h : Washington: ⛅️ 🌡️+12°C 🌬️↓4km/h 
 The symbol of partly-cloudy in washington was not rendered:
 https://preview.redd.it/oisno3plx9zb1.png?width&#x3D;641&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;54d2246de4877f8c08bdb98fc8504b27ea1b36da
 I&#x27;m currently using Emacs 29.1 on Windows 10, and have set the symbol fonts as &quot;&quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot; which does have symbol of partly-cloudy.
 (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot; nil &#x27;prepend) 
 I alterntively tried &quot;Symbola&quot; font but the issue repeats. How could solve the problem?

I know that I can use the linter with an after-save-hook, but is there any other solutions with flycheck or lsp integrations? (I tried flycheck-clang-tidy but I didn&#x27;t get any warrings or indicators, not sure if clang-tidy can detect them though)

I understand enough to know that this might not be possible for all haskell programs, but if I understand correctly it is a step in the CLASH compiler which supports a very large portion of the language (libraries no, but language yes). I am aware of various pragmas to direct GHC to attempt to do this in specific places, but is there anything like this available in the GHC libraries?

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the latest release of mig-0.2 library. It is a library to write composable servers for simple / boring haskell. The main focus of this release is the ability to serve Swagger UI from the server with ease and ability to create clients from the same code as servers. I&#x27;m happy to confirm that both goals are reached with this release. 
 The tutorial for library was created.
 Also there are many other improvements:
  
OpenApi schema for servers
 swagger servers support (we can add swagger to server with one line of code: withSwagger def server )
 clients from the same code as servers
 redesign of internal types
 redesign of DSL for routes
 many ergonomic improvements
 packages for extra utils
 split of mig package to several packages: 
 mig - core
 mig-wai - rendering servers to wai apps
 mig-client - clients
 mig-extra - extra utils
 mig-server - mig servers with batteries
 mig-swagger-ui - swagger ui server
 
 tutorial and quickstart guide on github pages
 CI for repo with formatter, build and tests and update of docs on github pages
  
The internal type for Servers was redesigned so that we assemble handler function with API description at the same time. In the first release it was just handler function under the hood.
 As a refresher mig is a family of libraries to write lightweight, simple, type-safe and composable servers. It strives to be in the middle ground between scotty and servant. To be composable, flexible and type-safe as servant and simple and lightweight in concepts as scotty.
 Thanks to Ambros for contribution. Also I&#x27;d like to thank authors of packages servant, servant-swagger-ui and servant-openapi3 packages for inspiration for my work in this release. Many lines of code are influenced by those packages.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We are very excited to announce Copilot 3.17 [2]. Copilot is a stream-based EDSL in Haskell for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Copilot has been used at NASA in drone test flights. Through the NASA tool Ogma [1] (also written in Haskell), Copilot also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System, Robot Operating System (ROS2), and FPrime (the software framework used in the Mars Helicopter) applications.
 This release introduces compatibility with what4 versions up to 1.5.1, and replaces several functions in copilot-core. The second change is a breaking change: the functions replaced have been deprecated and new alternatives introduced instead.
 As always, we&#x27;re releasing exactly 2 months since the last release. Our next release is scheduled for Jan 7th, 2024.
 In our last announcement, we mentioned that Copilot has received full approval for release as NASA Class D open-source software. Current emphasis is on increasing test coverage for the two remaining libraries without tests (copilot-libraries and copilot-theorem), removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to participate by opening issues and asking questions via our github repo [3].
 There have been many updates on the Copilot front in the last few months. We&#x27;ll be able to announce more soon. Stay tuned. Happy Haskelling!
 Ivan

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m pulling out my hair trying to figure this out. I don&#x27;t have much experience with the advanced Haskell features (Lenses, constrained type variables) they&#x27;re using in this library so I need halp.
 I&#x27;m trying to write a ToParamSchema instance for a type that will be documented in swagger (link). This is my code:
 instance ToParamSchema DeprSchedule where toParamSchema _ &#x3D; let dollarSchema &#x3D; toSchema (Proxy :: Proxy Dollar) daySchema &#x3D; toSchema (Proxy :: Proxy Day) in mempty &amp; type_ ?~ SwaggerArray &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] 
 When I try to compile, I get this huge error
 src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:357:15: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘t’ with ‘&#x27;Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKindSchema’ arising from a functional dependency between: constraint ‘Data.Swagger.Lens.HasItems (ParamSchema t) (Maybe (SwaggerItems &#x27;Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKindSchema))’ arising from a use of ‘items’ instance ‘Data.Swagger.Lens.HasItems (ParamSchema t1) (Maybe (SwaggerItems t1))’ at  ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: toParamSchema :: forall (t :: Data.Swagger.Internal.SwaggerKind (*)). Proxy DeprSchedule -&gt; ParamSchema t at src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:351:5-17 • In the first argument of ‘(?~)’, namely ‘items’ In the second argument of ‘(&amp;)’, namely ‘items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema]’ In the expression: mempty &amp; type_ ?~ SwaggerArray &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] • Relevant bindings include toParamSchema :: Proxy DeprSchedule -&gt; ParamSchema t (bound at src/DeprCalc/Types.hs:351:5) | 357 | &amp; items ?~ SwaggerItemsArray [Inline dollarSchema, Inline daySchema] | ^^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded. 
 Plz help, I have no idea what to do with this error.

                              <span>I made a function to check whether a number is divisible only by 2, 3, or 5. After some modifications this is the current form:
 isHammingF :: Integer -&gt; Bool isHammingF number | number  Integer -&gt; Bool recur 1 _ &#x3D; True recur n i | i &gt; 5 &#x3D; False | n &#x60;mod&#x60; i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; recur (n &#x60;div&#x60; i) i | otherwise &#x3D; recur n (i + 1) 
 I based this function from its Kotlin counterpart:
 fun Int.isHammingF(): Boolean { val number &#x3D; abs(this) tailrec fun recur(number: Int, i: Int): Boolean &#x3D; if (i &gt; 5) false else if (number % i &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) recur(number / i, i) else recur(number, i + 1) return if (number &lt; 8) number in 1..6 else recur(number, 2) } 
 I&#x27;m trying to make the function easy to translate in the two languages. However, some things are getting in the way:
  
How do I make the value of parameter number absolute? In Kotlin, I just have to make a new variable that holds the absolute value of the parameter in a line, making it more ‘step to step’. But in Haskell, I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s possible to do that in functions.
 Why does when I remove the recur 1 _ &#x3D; True line from the Haskell code, it only evaluate 1–6 as true? I tried to make a list of numbers 1–256, filtered using this function with recur 1 _ &#x3D; True removed, and the result is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. If it were correct, it should still produce [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,…, 250, 256]. I also tried to change it into recur 5 _ &#x3D; True or other numbers, and the resulting list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,…] followed by Hamming numbers divisible by that number. What is recur 1 _ &#x3D; True really? How to remove it if it&#x27;s okay to?
  
Any help is appreciated.

 Elm-like ScalaJS Calculator App
 Hey there,
 I wanted to share my recent experiment with ScalaJS and frontend development. Despite I use Scala for a long time, I don&#x27;t know shit about frontend development. Still, Elm&#x27;s simplicity got me thinking - maybe some of its principles could work in Scala too. So I made a basic calculator app written in ScalaJS and using Tyrian.
 Hope you dig it! Feel free to drop your thoughts.
 Best,

 https://medium.com/@HyperCodeLab/an-introduction-to-scala-zio-4f2ec4cae8b7 
 but when I try to implement
 RandomGeneratorServiceImplTest 
 as described in the article, it won&#x27;t compile until I add the apply function. I also checked both build.sbt, they seem to be identical.
 Can someone help me understand why this is necessary?

A Fistful of Automata by Iago Leal de Freitas (originally published on October 20th, 2023)
Recently, I have been brushing up my knowledge of Formal Languages and stumbled again into the many different faces of finite automata.

                              <span>Hi,
A few years ago, I started to take daily note and take a lot, but at the end of a day, I have difficulty on how to deal with those notes.
The major problem is, I can&#x27;t decide the size of a note derived from my daily note.
Say, I take a note like &quot;5 students have sent me the language test invoice regarding applying for an academic reward. In my understanding, this could be directly put into &quot;Academic Reward&quot; or &quot;Things related to Academic Reward for Language Test&quot;. But if I do so, I feel guilty because it looks not even a bit like a Zettel systems.
I heard a lot of so-called atomic notes, but I never really see a real-world, down-to-earth workflow of authentic zettel.</span>

This article explains how we integrated Testwell CTC++ coverage testing into their Bazel build system.
Integrating coverage testing with Testwell CTC++ into a project that builds with Bazel has its own unique challenges. We navigated the combination of these two tools to provide a solution that was a good fit for our client.

The mismatch between Bazel’s built-in coverage support and CTC++
As described in its documentation, Bazel does include some support for code coverage reports, however, it is relatively limited and inflexible, only suppor…</span>

                              <span>When I run emacs -nw (Emacs 29.1) in an iterm2 window on a MacBook Pro, it does a decent job of rendering the theme colors. But if in the same window (outside of emacs) I ssh to a server (that has an identical init.el) and run the same, the colors are way off. I&#x27;m looking for advice (beyond &quot;use TRAMP&quot;) for how to get better theme colors over ssh.
 In both cases the value of $TERM is xterm-256color. The output of msgcat --color&#x3D;test is the same in both shells. But in emacs the output of M-x list-color-display is quite different in the two cases: in the local window there are 556 colors with many descriptive names, but in the ssh context there are 256 colors with limited names (color-NNN for NNN in 16 through 255).

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 the title already is quite specific, so I&#x27;ll just try to explain a bit more.
 I use &#x60;text-mode-hook&#x60; to activate &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60; when I am in an org-mode buffer. This approach works quite alright, but I am struggling to make it work with another recent addition to my workflow, &#x60;desktop.el&#x60;.
 I want to use &#x60;desktop&#x60; to save opened files, window and tab bar configurations. After some tinkering this also works out fine, however, when I use &#x60;desktop-read&#x60; on a constellation that contains org-mode buffers, it seems like darkroom-mode is applied twice, i.e. the font is even bigger than with normal &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60; applied.
 I have tried to use &#x60;desktop-after-read-hook&#x60; to re-initialize &#x60;darkroom-mode&#x60;:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (defun or/re-initialize-darkroom ()
 (progn
 (darkroom-mode -1)
 (darkroom-mode +1)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, this does not seem to work, because the text still is oversized. If it were only for one tab or buffer where this is the case, I&#x27;d swallow that pill. However, it is the case in all org buffers, which is a tad too annoying with four tabs containing four different org files.
 Thus, I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences, maybe you&#x27;ve got a tip or two for me?
 Have a good day!

 My only issue is mostly aesthetic. I use EXWM and usually run kitty inside it because I like having my terminals have a different background color than my buffers. 
 Is it possible to have emacs color my Eat buffers differently than others? 
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>So my excitement at emacs on my Steamdeck was shortlived
 I rebooted the Steamdeck and Emacs won&#x27;t launch.
 This is a containerised install (with the app exported to the OS&#x27; launcher) on an immutable OS. I&#x27;m struggling (perhaps) because this is my first experience of either.
 I used the Steamdeck install guide on the distrobox wiki
 The only clues I have (apologies for the shorthand, I&#x27;m on my phone and my Steamdeck has no internet) are:
  
If I try to list my distrobox containers I get invalid internal status, try resetting the pause process with ... podman system migrate
 
If I try that command I get Error: could not find a working conman binary and then a list of (non home) paths.
 
 However, the path to conmon is correct in containers.conf
 Is distrobox looking for something (conmon) but I don&#x27;t have the location right in a config file somewhere?

                              <span>I have a minir inconvenience I hope to be able to solve. I have a couple of markdown buffers open. Many times details are hidden away using outline mode. When I use &#x60;rgrep&#x60; to search for occurences in buffers, which are already open, and use the mouse to jump to the matching buffer and occuence, point jumps to the closest visible occurence but doesn&#x27;t &quot;open&quot; details which are hidden because of outline mode.
 Is there a way to reveal the actually matching details?

                              <span>Dear emacs neckbeards, perspective-el (https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el) works really nice but there is some visual clutter because the indicator for the workspace names are visible in each window ( i know doom emacs doesn&#x27;t which is cleaner) , does someone has a solution please ? ( see in picture please )
 To be conicse i just want the workspace indicator e.g [main | second] to be displayed once, at the top left corner, and not 3 times in each window.

 edit: I found out, that the text &quot;[main|second]&quot; is on the header line of each window, controlled by the variable &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; header-line-format &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; which has the value (&quot;&quot; (:eval (persp-mode-line))) in my case.
 One idea would be to track the number of windows in the current workspace with window-list, 
 if it is greated then 2 -&gt; add a hook to every new created window in the workspace and set the variable &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; header-line-format &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; to nil, thus it should be empty, but sadly i dont have time for that at the moment.

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Training for my Centenarian Decathlon
I&#x27;m interested in adopting a &quot;gradient descent&quot; approach to help me systematically identify and explore the most relevant aspects of an idea&#x27;s structure.
I&#x27;m refactoring my ZK Dashboard and the Python programs that create it.
My class on Atmosphere Science is getting interesting as it comes to an end in a few weeks. I&#x27;m concentrating on the final project: a state application for a prescribed burn.
Today (November 8, 2023) is the 5th anniversary of my ZK with The Archive.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Attia, Peter and Gifford, Bill. Outlive: the science &amp; art of longevity. 2023.
Calvino, Italo. The road to San Giovanni. 1994.
Cowen, Tyler. GOAT: Who is the Greatest Economist of all Time and Why Does it Matter?. 2023.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Jeff Oster

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>In inferior-python-mode, Tab completion inserts weird commands of the form &quot;__PYTHON_EL_eval_&quot; ... which are used by emacs to communicate with the shell, but are irrelevant as completions.
 Any ideas how to get rid of them?
 I suggested a workaround using: 
  (defun my-python-completion-filter (completions) &quot;Filter out the unwanted &#x27;__PYTHON\_EL&#x27; from COMPLETIONS.&quot; (cl-remove-if (lambda (completion) (string-match-p &quot;__PYTHON_EL&quot; completion)) completions)) (advice-add &#x27;python-shell-completion-get-completions :filter-return #&#x27;my-python-completion-filter) 
 but I feel like I should better understand the exact source of the problem and have a more robust solution.

 It seems that the situation is just like one described in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnus-english/2014-02/msg00047.html
 After some debug, I found that GNUS just doesn&#x27;t apply any faces, so (get-text-property pos &#x27;face) returns nil for summary buffer.
 Now I&#x27;m not even sure where should I look for a clue: GNUS sources don&#x27;t seem to be changed much, the same GNUS works fine with emacs 28 and 27, so apparently it&#x27;s a change in emacs itself. Are there any obvious places to check?

                              <span>When I copy-paste text from Emacs to Brave (and the other Chrome-based browsers I&#x27;ve tested with) something goes wrong and non-USASCII characters end up being shown as �.

 My current workaround is to copy from Emacs, paste in any other application (often Firefox), then copy from there, and finally paste in Brave.
 Has anyone else seen this behaviour? How do I change it?
 (I guess I&#x27;m hoping this is a Brave/Chrome problem, as Firefox handles it brilliantly, but I thought I&#x27;d ask here first as it&#x27;s only when I copy text from Emacs that this happens.)
 (Oh, and yes, unfortunately I do need to use a Chrome-based browser for work. Thank you Microsoft!)

                              <span>Has anyone seen any efforts to make emacs behave more similar to TextMate on macOS? The goal would be to make most keybindings work similar to not only TextMate, but generally accepted keyboard bindings for macOS as well as quitting/opening saving and restoring the &quot;desktop&quot; session saving functionality.
 This would be utilizing the railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport port via brew install emacs-mac --with-emacs-big-sur-icon --with-native-compilation --with-imagemagick --with-librsvg --with-mac-metal --with-starter

                              <span>Following a recent-ish complaint about how a double-width char looked in the popup, I now pushed a somewhat ambitious update to the Company popup&#x27;s rendering (the default, built-in frontend), to master.
 It should better co-habitate with such characters (inside the buffer and in completions) and with other advanced elements (larger text, small images, etc).
 Of course it&#x27;s still overlay-based, and some things are unchanged: e.g. how the text &quot;under&quot; it becomes devoid of certain elements like button decorations (when those are themselves created using overlays) and line numbers.

                              <span>Recently, many folks have been claiming that their Large Language Model (LLM) is the best at coding. Their claims are typically based off self-reported evaluations on the HumanEval benchmark. But when you look into that benchmark, you realize that it only consists of 164 Python programming problems.
 This led me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how helpful LLMs actually are with different programming, scripting, and markup languages. I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit. Below you will find what I have figured out about Scala so far.
 Do you have any feedback or perhaps some anecdotes about using LLMs with Scala to share?

                              <span>Recently, many folks have been claiming that their Large Language Model (LLM) is the best at coding. Their claims are typically based off self-reported evaluations on the HumanEval benchmark. But when you look into that benchmark, you realize that it only consists of 164 Python programming problems.
 This led me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how helpful LLMs actually are with different programming, scripting, and markup languages. I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit. Below you will find what I have figured out about Haskell so far.
 Do you have any feedback or perhaps some anecdotes about using LLMs with Haskell to share…</span>

                              <span>I was using magit normally, but it suddenly stopped working. Specifically I can&#x27;t commit files outside my home directory. Commits in home directory works file, but when committing a file on other partitions fails. Here is the error message:
  1 git … commit -- hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Not inside Git repository 
 With debug info on, here is the full debug message:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Setting ACL&quot; &quot;Operation not permitted&quot; &quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot;) set-file-acl(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) set-file-extended-attributes(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; ((acl . &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer-copy(&quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG&quot; &quot;/media/croxx/vixen/ronto/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG~&quot; 511 ((acl . &quot;user::rwx\ngroup::rwx\nother::rwx\n&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer() basic-save-buffer-2() basic-save-buffer-1() basic-save-buffer(t) save-buffer(1) funcall-interactively(save-buffer 1) call-interactively(save-buffer nil nil) command-execute(save-buffer) 
 I&#x27;ve tried reinstalling emacs and magit, clearing the elpa directory and cache. I&#x27;m on linux. A thing to note is that it suddenly stopped working. A few hours ago it was working fine, but now it errors. I believe there is some permission error on other partitions, but can&#x27;t figure out what.
 Edit: The partition is NTFS formatted.
 Edit #2: The problem is almost certainly due to the partition beign NTFS. For now, I&#x27;ve switched to a ext4 partition.

                              <span>Hello. I am having some difficulty setting up my emacs to do spell check and offer the correct spelling when in LaTeX mode. 
 I currently have got emacs highlighting spelling errors correctly, but cannot get emacs to present the correct spelling for me. 
 I currently hide the tool bar as a like to use emacs mouse free in i3. I use GNU Emacs 28.2 on Debian. I currently only get spell check via :
 (add-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook &#x27;flyspell-mode)
 Does anyone have any advice on how to get emacs to present the correct spelling (ideally without a mouse) while in latex mode. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am not sure this is the right place to share the issue. But I found a bug with typing Korean characters that &quot;overwrite-mode&quot; is not actually working well. (For Japanese/Chinese characters, there is no issue at all.)
 aeoiu
 &#x3D;&gt; あえu
 &#x3D;&gt; 阿榜u
 &#x3D;&gt; 아에aeiou (not working)
 ​
 In the thread, one of the Japanese users reported a bug but it is not appropriate for Korean characters which requires a combination of sub-characters to make a character unlike other Japanese or Chinese characters.
  
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-05/msg00039.html
  
​
  
Is there anyone who has encountered and found a workaround for this? (I know there are a few Korean Emacs users... sadly.. )
 I guess I have to report this issue and try something to fix it. Where can I start with?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s assume this given Python code snippet (real example / Microsoft GitHub Issue).
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import qttools
 def askPasswordDialog(): translator &#x3D; qttools.name_with_typo(language_code) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The package qttools is contained in the same folder/project. The function name_with_typo() does not exist in qttools. This cause an AttributeError when run with a Python interpreter.
 I do use Emacs 27 and 29 with eglot and flake8. The described error is not detected because eglot/flake do not look into the imported package if the function really exist in there.
 Can I fix this somehow?
 Beside of that tested flake8 on shell. It is also not able to detect such a problem.
 Not sure if I can improve the detection within my Emacs environment?

                              <span>Hi, I am using functions from u/daviwil including one adding any roam node containing TODO keywords to the list of agenda files. I see that I must have done something wrong, since I have more than 200 files in my variable org-agenda-files (nothing bad).
 Of course, I can select them one by one and remove them. But this problem lead me to wonder if there is a function in emacs that allows to create a Dired buffer out of a list of files (typically org-agenda-files), in order to be able to remove them if need be with the Dired functions (mark, delete)
 thanks for any info regarding this

                              <span>I just watched Haoyi’s Scala Days talk on his Mill build tool and it made me really want to give it a try. Has anyone here been using it recently? Any pitfalls I should be aware of? Is there a plug-in ecosystem (or whatever the Mill equivalent is) that would support most typical use cases without my having to roll my own? (I’m thinking like docker build, publishing to Sonatype, graal native image, etc.)
 Or to put it another way, what am I going to end up missing from sbt down the road if I switch to Mill?
 For those who haven’t seen the talk: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;UsXgCeU-ovI

                              <span>The idea is really simple - I think a major factor that makes type level programming (Edit: syntax within the type namespace) confusing for someone coming from the imperative world is that it shares so much syntax with value level programming (the value namespace). Obviously once you&#x27;ve learned it that&#x27;s really nice and clean, but before you have it can add a lot of confusion. So I came up with these custom instructions that I added to ChatGPT, and type level programming (the type namespace) instantly became much clearer.
 These instructions were generated by ChatGPT and since I don&#x27;t know the language well it&#x27;s possible they could be improved. I&#x27;d really love feedback if anyone experienced sees an issue with how ChatGPT structured these instructions.

                              <span>Hi, there,
One thing I still yet figure out is how to name my files.
On macOS, it&#x27;s not that a big problem as I have DevonThink 3 Pro, tags and smart folders that help me retrieve files. But whenever I don&#x27;t have access to macOS and look through my long list of files in my external SSD, it was so painful. Currently, I only add a timebase UID to the end of all my files. And my file name is already long and lasting.
Is there any suggestion on how to better name my files, making it friendly to both windows, iOS and macOS?</span>

                              <span>I am working through the red book and trying the examples and exercises in a folder on my computer. I created two files GettingStarted and List, both of which I selected as new Scala classes and then Objects in Intellij.
  
I&#x27;ve noticed that I can only have one main function. I can&#x27;t put a main in both GettingStarted and List. The IDE only recognizes the one in GettingStarted. I&#x27;m thinking this entire folder is considered one project, and you can only have one entrypoint in main. Is this right?
 I put extends App in List, and then I could run and debug things in List. I guess extending the main function from GettingStarted, I can then run the List file on its own.
  
Can someone explain to me how I should be thinking about files interacting with each other? In python I would use a __name__ &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;__main__&quot; to run code in each file. In C, I could write an int main() in each file and run each separately. But it seems in Scala it&#x27;s very specific in terms of how def main() can appear.

                              <span>I know there is Iron and there is Refined, but both of those use some synthetic type under the hood and type conversions. 
 Is there any library that provides ways to simply refine types with simple intersection types? This would mean the code would read naturally and the subtyping/supertyping would work out of the box, eg. Int &amp; Positive &amp; Even would be an Int, a Positive number and an even number &quot;0, 2, 4, 6, etc&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m moving from Doom to Vanilla Emacs because I wanted a better understanding of emacs from the ground up and I&#x27;m trying to replicate the features I liked most from Doom. I&#x27;m using C-h k and entering key-sequences to figure out the underlying functions and installing packages as needed.
 The one I&#x27;m interested in now is &quot;consult-buffer&quot; which I found useful in that it merged open and recently closed files in order that I had worked with them from session to session.
 There are small things bugging me as I&#x27;m not convinced the &quot;sort&quot; for most recently used files/buffers is reliable with the ideal being that the 2nd last used file shows up in the list first, and the 3rd last used file shows up second.
 Doom has configuration set to modify the consult-buffer there to hide the currently active buffer which is at the top by default when I call consult-buffer. I&#x27;m not finding the consult documentation much help (maybe lacking basic background on some of the concepts to grok it) and I was thinking there would be some of setq that you could use like (setq consult-buffer-ignore-top-items 1). I&#x27;m not sure how to dig into Doom&#x27;s internals to see what it is doing either.

I&#x27;m also using cdlatex, so I can use the snippet for \left( \right) inside of math, but sometimes I do need a regular &quot;(&quot; insertion. All the other insertions like &quot;{&quot;, &quot;[&quot; and $ get their autopairs, but there is something wrong with parenthesis only.
 ​
  
C-h k ( gives that &quot; &#x27;(&#x27; runs the cdlatex-pbb ... insert a pair of parens, brackets or braces&quot;. Same for all the other keys { and [.
 Global minor modes enabled: Electric-pair is enabled, but I don&#x27;t know if that might be the cause of conflict.
 Inside my init.el I have, for electric-pairs
  
​
  (electric-pair-mode 1) (setq electric-pair-pairs &#x27;( (?\&quot; . ?\&quot;) (?{ . ?}) (?( . ?)) (?[ . ?]))) (setq electric-pair-preserve-balance nil 
 And I&#x27;ve tried to remove the smartparens mode from TeX buffers by adding
 (remove-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook &#x27;smartparens-mode) 
 But I still can&#x27;t get it to work.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using password-store package to interact with https://www.passwordstore.org/ which I use for all my passwords and so far everything seems to work correctly, except that, somehow the passwords copied to the clipboard are removed from emacs kill-ring after the timeout but NOT from the system clipboard (e.g. in KDE the password persist and I can see it through KDE&#x27;s clipboard contents).
 When using pass through my terminal everything works as expected and passwords are removed from the system clipboard after the timeout.
 Does anybody knows how to fix this? I want copied passwords to be removed from all clipboards after the given timeout.

Currently, it still shows the items I need at the top, since I use savehist-mode, but the order changes depending on what I select. I&#x27;m using vertico &amp; consult for the selection.
 My current idea is to create a different completing-read command which has the commands I want pinned and I can add &quot;execute-extended-command&quot; as another in there. But a way to pin items would be easier for my use-case.

 Hi; I am using emacs (emacsclient) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with the Gnome desktop (wayland session). I am looking for a way to give emacs a dark title bar to go along with the dark theme, without setting global dark mode (I like some other applications better light), so basically to ask for a dark window decoration on application-basis. Has anyone done this?

 I have found other posts (like this one: https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/doom-emacs-2 or this one https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14129/gtk-enable-set-dark-theme-on-a-per-application-basis) but the solutions here don&#x27;t seem to work for me...

                              <span>Hey all,
 I was hoping to get some advice before I lose a lot of time down this rabbit hole. 
 An important factor in my note taking is accessibility on mobile devices. 
 I&#x27;ve been considering switching my note taking and programming over to Emacs, however those are all markdown.Hence my interest in log seq.Does it work well without mangling your notes like it would for markdown?And how does query suport transfer between the two? As currently obsidian datavieuw queries are a large part of my notetaking flow, and I would like to keep that.
 I&#x27;m aware and in awe of the true power of Emacs, and almost dove into setting up Vim to be the environment I live in, but found Emacs just in time.

 I am a newbie and trying to go through “learn Haskell by making a blog generator” by gilmi..
 It’s a wonderful resource.. but what I am not able to understand is why would one use Haskell or any other language like that? 
 Why not simply use html or css ? Or rails for a web app?
 Why code through another language?
 Is it speed of development ? Or security ? Or something else..
 My apologies if it seems like a dumb question..

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use overlays with the end goal of putting images in some buffer. But the use-case I have in mind require me to be able to make the images temporarily invisible, which I understand should be possible with overlays. Before going to images, I thought I&#x27;ll try making it work with just plain text. But I cannot make it work. I&#x27;m able to create overlays, modify the text shown in the overlay, move the overlay, delete the overlay, but I&#x27;m not able to hide the content of the overlay by setting the invisible property.
 I have looked at the manual, reading about overlays, overlay properties and text properties. I&#x27;ve tried to google for help but haven&#x27;t managed to find anything. I have also tried to look at how existing packages(like the builtin hideshow.el) do this, but without success.

                              <span>Sometimes I stumble on some new, interesting emacs thing that I want to try out. Recent examples: M-r / move-to-window-line-top-bottom, or M-@ / mark-word. Or I want to have a little reminder: &quot;try out foo-mode, it seems interesting&quot;.
 I want some kind of emacs command that would:
  
have a collection of such tips/tricks/ideas.
 When invoked, randomly choose one and show it in a temporary buffer.
  
Is there such a package or command? It seems like it would be nice. Emacs is stuffed full of interesting, weird, useful things that no one seems to know about. And even when I read about something, I might try it once or twice but then forget.
 There&#x27;s org-drill which is kinda close to this, but I want something simpler. Just pick out a thing and show it to me. 
 Suggestions?

                              <span>So I&#x60;m one of those org-mode guys who has emacs installed on pretty much every machine. however my latest install is leaving me feeling really stupid!
 I&#x60;m installing doom emacs on my steamdeck. The OS (Steam OS) is a partially read-only arch based system with Plasma DE that has emacs 29 available as a flatpak.
 I used the manual install from the doom emacs github, but am stuck because I can&#x60;t doom sync
 I added EMACS&#x3D;&quot;/usr/bin/flatpak run org.gnu.emacs&quot; at line 2 of ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom
 however, I still get the error 
 Error: failed to run Emacs with command &#x27;emacs&#x27; Are you sure Emacs is installed and in your $PATH 
 I must be doing something wrong here...

Do others see that behavior too? Note that the quoted text is using Latin small capital letters. If so, do you think it is part of Unicode specification or is it an Emacs bug? Thanks.

                              <span>I have not seen much mention of this amazing package but shout out to the eat (Emulate A Terminal) package. It is my favorite terminal emulator of the bunch (yes even over vterm) and has actually improved my workflow. It does not need an external C library to be downloaded and in my opinion has the best keybindings of any terminal emulator I have tried. It has 3 main modes to cycle between:
  
Input Mode (C-c C-e) &#x3D; similar to vterm&#x27;s copy mode the buffer becomes &quot;frozen&quot; for you to copy the text and scroll back and basically use all of emacs&#x27;s nifty search features.
 Char Mode (C-c M-d) &#x3D; One of my favorite modes where basically every input you make short of the keys C-M-m or M-RET will be sent to the terminal. This means I can open vim/nano/emacs -nw all within the terminal buffer (which I do a lot as I ssh into machines regulary) and it works absolutely perfectly. 
 Semi-Char Mode: The default mode where most inputs will be sent to the terminal. This mode does 90% of the job but if sometimes you have a weird mix of alt and control input combinations to send then the Char Mode is there for you.
  
Just wanted to bring more attention to this pacakage and would recommend others to try it a bit.
 Thank you /u/AkibAzmain for creating and maintaining this package.

 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone is working on a BlueSky emacs client? I know that their project opened the API code or something and there have been a lot of projects involving people making stuff for BlueSky since then. So for those of us who use Emacs, is there anyone doing that?
 Just wondering. 🤔

                              <span>I could have sworn they are valid, but some how org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 #+TBLFM: A&amp;&#x3D;&#x27;(concat &quot;(vhtd/filegroups-init-group&quot; &quot; &quot; (rc-dq C&amp;) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq B&amp;) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq D&amp;) &quot;)&quot;)
 I had to convert the letter references into numbers for the formulae to work.
 #+TBLFM: $1&#x3D;&#x27;(concat &quot;(vhtd/filegroups-init-group&quot; &quot; &quot; (rc-dq $3) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq $2) &quot; &quot; (rc-dq $4) &quot;)&quot;)
 From the documentation. The second example highlights what I&#x27;m referring to. I can&#x27;t remember changing or editing the formula for a long time, unless some command must have changed it without my noticing.
  
Org’s references with unsigned numbers are fixed references in the sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two different fields, the same field is referenced each time. Org’s references with signed numbers are floating references because the same reference operator can reference different fields depending on the field being calculated by the formula.
 Here are a few examples:
 ‘@2$3’ 2nd row, 3rd column (same as ‘C2’)
 ‘$5’ column 5 in the current row (same as ‘E&amp;’)
 ‘@2’ current column, row 2
 ‘@-1$-3’ field one row up, three columns to the left
 ‘@-I$2’ field just under hline above current row, column 2
 ‘@&gt;$5’ field in the last row, in column 5

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to create a formatter for my org files. What I want is a command to enforce strict rules in my org files. Examples: exactly two newlines between headings, no whitespace before drawers, no leading/trailing whitespace on lines, two newlines after lists, paragraphs must be filled, etc.
 I think the way to do this is to use org-element to parse the buffer into an AST, then iterate each element performing transformations as necessary. Not sure if I&#x27;d mutate the current AST or build up a new one.
 Does that sound right? Anything I should be aware of before digging into this?

                              <span>Not really about haskell. Rather about the people coding in haskell and enjoying haskell and their opinion.
 Honestly, what do you think about the books &quot;Domain Driven Design&quot; and &quot;Clean Code&quot;.
 They seem to be so widely spread and read. But I wonder if they are somewhat similar to, lets say, using OOP all day coding in Java.
 Just something a lot of people do which I am not drawn to and would not want to do.
 Should I read them?

                              <span>Hi
 I am a student currently studying Haskell for my graduation project. I&#x27;m wondering how exactly do I manage (install and view) my Haskell packages? I&#x27;m very confused now. I installed &quot;QuickCheck&quot;, but whether through &quot;ghc-pkg list&quot; or &quot;cabal list --installed&quot;, I cannot find the &quot;QuickCheck&quot; or &quot;Test&quot; package in their lists. But it was installed successfully because I was able to use it by &quot;import Test.QuickCheck&quot;.

                              <span>Hi, we just supported scala serialization in fury 0.3.0 version: https://github.com/alipay/fury . With this release, fury supports all scala 2/3 objects serializaiton now, including: case/pojo/object/option/tuple/collecton/enum and other types. case/pojo/object are tightly integrated with fury JIT. Fury will generate highly-optimized serializer by generate serialize code at runtime to speed up serializaiton. The serialization for those objects will be extremely fast.

 For a long time, scala serialization is always tricky, only fully-reliable way is to use JDK serialization. But it&#x27;s too slow, and the serialized size is too large. Although we have frameworks such as twill, but the support for scala types are limited, and the performance is limited too.Now with fury scala, you can serialize any scala objects you want and get extremly fast performance.Please try it out and let us know if you have any issues.

                              <span>There are many org keybindings which do different things depending on context. I&#x27;ve found this makes it difficult to find what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Example, I forgot how to toggle list bullets. Using the help system, I found a command called org-cycle-list-bullet . Exactly what I was looking for! Unfortunately, according to help it&#x27;s not bound to anything.
 Except actually it is: when on a list, org-ctrl-c-minus (C-c -) does the magic.
 I learned that by pulling up the docs. That&#x27;s fine, but can be slow, and feels against-the-grain so to speak; for this kind of stuff (eg just looking for a keybinding), I prefer to use emacs&#x27; help system.
 Any suggestions on this? Maybe I&#x27;m not using help/search to its full potential. Or maybe going to the docs is the only way?
 ​
 EDIT: I think my post wasn&#x27;t very clear. Maybe this is more clear:
 Given that I know that org-cycle-list-bullet does what I want, and that it is not bound, what is the most efficient way to find that it can be used from C-c -?

                              <span>This is my first foray into org-ql and org-ql-block. I am trying to achieve something that I was able to do in org&#x27;s Block agenda tags-todo views, and I have been largely successful, except ...
 ... In agenda views generated by org&#x27;s block agenda, pressing &lt; narrows the output to the category present under the cursor - meaning, only entries for that category are visible, the rest hidden.
 When I press the same key in blocks generated by org-ql-block, I get a message: org-agenda-filter-by-category: No category at point
 The error message makes sense because the output of org-ql-block does not include the category, whereas the output of tags-todo does.
 Here is an example of output from tags-todo:
 individual-competency-fy24:STARTED [#B] Download course transcript :ATTACH:ActiveTask:
 The leading individual-competency-fy24 is not showing in org-ql-block output.
 So, is another command needed, or do I need to configure org-ql-block to output the category. And if so, how?
 Thanks,
 Mirko

                              <span>I have following the Emacs LSP Mode documentation on adding support for languages, and so far this is what I have achieved in my configuration:
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;lsp-mode (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(arduino-mode . &quot;arduino&quot;)) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp--client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection &#x27;(&quot;arduino-language-server&quot; &quot;-clangd&quot; &quot;clangd&quot; &quot;-cli&quot; &quot;arduino-cli&quot; &quot;-cli-config&quot; &quot;/home//.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml&quot; &quot;-fqbn&quot; &quot;arduino:avr:uno&quot;)) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;arduino&quot;) :server-id &#x27;arduino-language-server))) 
 And this is according to the arduino-language-server documentation.
 My issue here:
  
I am not sure of the server-id, and I don&#x27;t know where to get it.
 When I invoke lsp command, I get connected to whatever I specify in the server-id, but I don&#x27;t get any IDE like functionality.
  
Any help will be much appreciated, and thank you in advance.

                              <span>I have resisted switching to company for a long time and have just been getting by with auto-complete.
 I decided to try out company (still with ac as well) and trying to get it to work the way I like. One thing I notice is that if I complete a word while the point is in the middle of a word it replaces the entire word including text after the point, unlike auto-complete.
 like if I have a line:
 &#x60;someFunction()&#x60;
 and I want to console.log it (in node) I would go to the beginning of the line and start typing
 &#x60;conssomeFunction()&#x60;
 Now if I select &#x60;console&#x60; as the completion, &#x60;someFunction&#x60; gets &quot;deleted&quot;. This is weird behaviour since I think this is a common use case. Adding a space first is unintuitive to me and feels like an extra step.
 Is this configurable? Am I missing something? Or is there something weird going on with my setup?

                              <span>I love using Emacs for R programming. On my new laptop, I&#x27;ve run into a configuration problem.
 I&#x27;ve installed R 4.3.2 on the Windows machine (a HP ZBook running Windows 10 Enterprise). The problem is that when I start R, it starts with version 3.6.1, which obviously is a big problem for me. I figure there&#x27;s got to be some dot-file, environment variable, or something that points to the R interpreter which I can change, but I&#x27;ve had no luck in finding this documented. Can someone help?

 When it comes to querying fonts, the frequent use of describe-face often perplexes users, as one might expect it to be describe-font.
 However, it wasn&#x27;t until today that I discovered &quot;font&quot; and &quot;typeface&quot; are synonymous. That is to say &quot;typeface&quot; being one type(kind) of faces. This realization instantly increased my inclination to embrace &#x60;set-face&#x60; and &#x60;describe-face&#x60;.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have improved my roam functionalities in integrating some of the functions offered by u/daviwil in his great video and post.
 So listing the tags is not a problem, I also know how to limit the search of node using filetags.
 But is there a possibility to create different categories of tags?
 I an working in the customer support in the IT, and I would like to apply the same functionalities offered for TAGS to another kind of tags (named error_tags).
 I already use the standard tags and filetags, but I need to link and search in my nodes (notes) for error_tags, that are snippets of logfiles with error messages.
 ​
 Is there any &quot;easy&quot; way to do it, or is the only way the creation of a property #+error_tags and the search using the package org-ql from u/alphapapa ?
 Thanks for sharing your opinions on this, or your workflow if you have already solved this problem?

 I&#x27;ve decided to drop Dropbox (;)) and revert to rsync/rsnapshot and removable media. I have a lot of bookmarks in my current-bookmark.el.gpg. I did a replace of &quot;Dropbox&quot; for &quot;sync&quot; (where sync is my mount) but when I save and restart emacs and try to access a bookmark using bmkp, I get:
 ​
  
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Cannot read definitions in bookmark file: Args ou...&quot;)

Can anyone shine a light on this please?

                              <span>Hi,
 Manifold Valley is a startup that produces animation data and other assets for game developers by leveraging machine learning. In addition to more standard machine learning tools like Pytorch, we use an embedded domain specific language and compiler written in Haskell to describe distributed data flows involving machine learning processes and game engines. We also build front end software in Haskell using the Monomer library and backend GPU code using a related functional language, Futhark. M.V. is an established team of a dozen developers now in its third year of research with tangible results.
 We are currently seeking a Haskell-centric developer to join our compiler development team. The job involves working on with machine learning engineers, artists and other developers to produce novel machine learning processes that go from controlling physical camera systems to producing finished game assets. Interested candidates should have a deep knowledge of the structure and interpretation of functional languages as well as ample real world Haskell knowledge. 
 Currently accepting resumes at manifoldvalley.com. The mail address begins with my name ian at-symbol. Competitive salary and benefits package. Relocation is possible but this is not a remote position.
 Kind regards.

 https://jobs.lever.co/anduril/80c23e90-ad9a-45b7-82da-ca8c4d5856b5
 ​
 Those with specific interest or experience in Nix/NixOS/Nixpkgs, systems programming, hardware interfaces, numerical programming, or signal processing, might find themselves particularly suitable for this role. If your commercial software engineering experience isn&#x27;t in Haskell or functional programming in particular, but you&#x27;re looking to break into commercial FP, please do get in touch; this is the path the majority of our team took to get where they are today.
 ​
 Our team works entirely on-site in Orange County, California, USA. Due to the nature of the products we are building, time in the lab is critical for our work.

                              <span>So, by Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem no system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an algorithm can provide a proof of it&#x27;s own consistency. Knowing that set theory is one such system, I began to wonder whether it&#x27;s possible to write a program, for which it&#x27;s impossible to prove that it never stops. Such a program, I imagine, would be able to describe set-theoretic theorems as values of some data type, then, given a set of axioms, combine those axioms using logic to form all the theorems of set theory. Then traverse those theorems and check if any of them are equivalent to a negation of one of the axioms, thus proving that set theory is inconsistent and causing the program to halt. For a program like that, you can&#x27;t show that it never stops, because that would require showing that set theory is consistent, which is impossible to do using set theory. The problem is, I have no idea how to write a program like that or where to even start. I thought haskell would be a good choice, because it&#x27;s already pretty close to math. If anyone is interested in this extremely nerdy endeavor, please halp :P

                              <span>There seem to be far fewer Haskell jobs. Several larger Haskell shops have closed or switched to another language. The salaries are not impressive, at all. And the jobs require production experience, making it more or less impossible to break into it that way.
 I have been doing Scala for a while now, but there is so much corruption from Java (idioms, libraries, etc). Finding a Scala shop that is Scala idiomatic, actually functional, cares about quality, and pays really well is a unicorn. Haskell seems like a logical step. But the market appears to say otherwise.
 I know other people, who know Haskell much better than I do, who can&#x27;t get a job doing Haskell. Just seems like putting in the significant effort required to get decently good at it won&#x27;t pay off.

                              <span>Some statically typed languages that have null provide null safety by having a nullable and non-nullable version of each type. The compiler will prevent you from using null when the non-nullable version of the type is expected. You can pass in the plain non-null version of the type into any function that takes in the nullable type. The nullable type is a union between the non-nullable type and null.
 Kotlin is a good example of a language like this. Typescript kinda mostly does it. I don&#x27;t know C# very well but I think the latest version finally fixed the initial nightmare they started with.
 Haskell, on the other hand, has Maybe. Maybe is a sum type, rather than a union type. If a function takes in a Maybe String, then you can&#x27;t pass a String into the function.
 One advantage nullable types have over Maybe is that it&#x27;s backwards compatible to weaken preconditions and strengthen postconditions. 
 If your library has a function
 fun doIt(foo: String): Int?
 Then in the next version, you can change the signature to
 fun doIt(foo: String?): Int
 In a backwards compatible way. In Haskell, changing
 doIt :: String -&gt; Maybe Int
 To 
 doIt :: Maybe String -&gt; Int
 Is a breaking change.
 Is there an advantage to representing optionality as a unique sum type, rather than a nullable union type?

                              <span>Dry now supports basic list, tuple, and dictionary operations.
 Here are some example code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; import assert;
 // from-imports aren&#x27;t supported yet let assert_equals &#x3D; assert.assert_equals; let assert_true &#x3D; assert.assert_true;
 // &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; list demo &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; let xs &#x3D; [1, &quot;two&quot;, 3];
 assert_equals(&quot;Stringify lists&quot;, &quot;[1, two, 3]&quot;, str(xs)); assert_equals(&quot;Second element&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, xs[1]);
 xs[0] &#x3D; 10; assert_equals(&quot;Update list&quot;, [10, &quot;two&quot;, 3], xs);
 let ys &#x3D; [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;]; del ys[1]; assert_equals(&quot;Delete a list element&quot;, [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;], ys); assert_equals(&quot;List size&quot;, 2, ys.size());
 assert_equals(&quot;Add new element to the list&quot;, [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;], [&quot;one&quot;].add(&quot;two&quot;));
 // &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; tuple demo &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; let tup &#x3D; (1, true, &quot;three&quot;, false); assert_equals(&quot;Stringify tuple&quot;, &quot;(1, true, three, false)&quot;, str(tup)); assert_equals(&quot;Third element&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, tup[2]);
 // &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; dictionary demo &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; let dict &#x3D; {1: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;: true};
 dict[&quot;two&quot;] &#x3D; false; assert_equals(&quot;Update dictionary&quot;, false, dict[&quot;two&quot;]); assert_true(&quot;New item added&quot;, dict[true] &#x3D; 10); assert_equals(&quot;Size after adding new item&quot;, 3, dict.size());
 del dict[&quot;two&quot;]; assert_equals(&quot;Size after deleting a item&quot;, 2, dict.size()); &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 You can probably easily tell that I based them on their Python counterparts. I&#x27;m also planning to add basic FP operations (map, filter, fold, etc.) for these types in the standard library. I think Dry will look great with them because of its support for multi-line lambdas.
 Anyways, here&#x27;s the repo: https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/dry Any questions, feedbacks, bug-reports will be welcomed.

                              <span>Hi, I don&#x27;t understand why the first version of retry in this chapter of Scala with Cats blows up the stack - surely it should at least work with the Option monad, with the function body evaluating to None when f(start) is None and to retry(x)(f) when f(start) is Some(x)? Could somebody explain?

                              <span>Hi! On Nov. 30, we are hosting a workshop both online and in-person during the Functional Scala Conference. In this training, you will learn about parametric polymorphism, higher-kinded types, implicits / givens, type class pattern, Any &amp; Nothing, lambda types, and basic macros. Join us to master the advanced features that make Scala distinct from other JVM languages.
 Whether you want to attend just the workshop or both the workshop and conference, the cost remains the same.

I will introduce myself shortly but later. After Apple Notes received an update and some functions that also benefit a Zettelkasten system, a question: To what extent would Notes be suitable for a ZKS? Is there anyone who organizes themselves exclusively with Notes? Thank you and thank you for the opportunity to choose here.</span>

                              <span>Hallo, I&#x27;m not able to understand how to process the FS2 stream in parallel: On the one hand I want to pass it on as IO, but it should stream in parallel into a file as cache.
 Now I am doing some nonsense like .compile.toList, which is not very efficient. What else can I do? 
 I am not asking for a solution, I am looking forward to ideas and inspiration.
 scala (for { result0 &lt;- Stream.eval(backend.queryDataStream(query, user, pageSize)) // nooooo! rowData &lt;- Stream.eval(result0.data.rows.compile.toList).covary[IO] result &lt;- Stream.eval(IO.pure(DataStreamResult(data &#x3D; result0.data.copy(rows &#x3D; Stream.emits(rowData)), &quot;success&quot;))) // run a fiber with &quot;queryFn&quot; _ &lt;- Stream.eval(queryAndCache( finalFile &#x3D; finalFile, tempCacheFile &#x3D; tempCacheFile, reportPrefix &#x3D; query.reportPrefix, queryFn &#x3D; IO.pure(result), cacheFn &#x3D; CacheStore.writeDataStream )) } yield result).compile.lastOrError

Last time I tried was June and it was a weird bookmark bug in Emacs 29.0.1. Today I tried again and finally make it look like in the screenshot. Without further ado, here is how:
 First. you need to install Roboto Mono and Fira Code as required by NANO for looking as intended:
  
Roboto Mono: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono
 Robot Slab for writer-mode: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab
 Fira Code: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code
  
If you are using Emacs 29 or above, for some reason, NANO requires bookmark-menu-heading to be available; even (require &#x27;bookmark) doesn&#x27;t work. Here i…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone! 🙃
 I copy a lot of files to other places from dired, and one thing I was wondering is: Is there a way for me to use consult-bookmarks or something, which I use a ton, when in the &quot;browse to location in the minibuffer&quot; thing? Basically, if I mark a file I want to copy to ~/Downloads, I hit C in dired, and then the mini buffer pops up with the file path, and I have to manually browse to it. It doesn&#x27;t take too long, but doing it like 30 times a day gets a bit annoying. I have ~/Downloads in my consult-bookmarks and I use that a ton in dired. So is there a way to use that bookmark to instantly browse there when it&#x27;s asking for a destination?
 Please let me know and thx again. 🙃

                              <span>hi, I know this is maybe far fetched, but does such a function / package exist, that show the emacs equivalent binding to any evil binding in the minibuffer? The goal is to learn the emacs bindings progressively (I started with evil mode). thanks for your insights

 For instance, in org-mode tab adds 4 spaces but backspace deletes only one single space. 
 For .rs, .py, etc files it does delete variable number of spaces depending on the context.

                              <span>I know that we can define things without their arguments in Haskell like: 
 haskell add1 &#x3D; (+) 1  and in that case, I love that I can do that. But the HLS seems to want me to do that everywhere:
 haskell insertionSort :: (Foldable t, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; t a -&gt; [a] insertionSort ls &#x3D; foldr insert [] ls where insert xNew [] &#x3D; [xNew] insert xNew ls@(x:xs) &#x3D; if xNew &lt; x then xNew : ls else x : insert xNew xs  Would y&#x27;all remove the ls or leave it? I like it with because I think its more readable when its more complete but I want to hear from others.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to save/load breakpoints from ghci repl.
 Is it possible ?
 Do you have any solution to load breakpoints automatically for a project (maybe from .ghci) ?
 regards,
 Lajos

                              <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Episode 36 – John Hughes by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode, Matti and Wouter are joined by John Hughes. John is one of the authors of the original Haskell Report and talks about why functional programming matters, the origins of QuickCheck testing, and how higher order functions and lazy evaluation is the key that makes functional programming so productive, and so much fun!

configuration language.
Presenting Nickel: better configuration for less
Programming with contracts in Nickel
Types à la carte in Nickel
Great configurations from little merges grow
We previously looked at the core language, then contracts, and finally typing.
The last important remaining piece to explore is the merge system. In this post,
we’ll see how to use the Nickel merge system to write reusable configuration
modules, and why the merge approach seems to be more adapted for modular
configurations than plain functions, despite Nickel being a functional language.

Programmable configuration

                              <span>This release brings ergonomic improvements for new types and other minor additions.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library bringing type constraints to Scala. You can attach predicates to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Improved RefinedTypeOps
 RefinedTypeOps has been refactored to provide: - Compatibility with future Scala versions - Improvements on RefinedTypeOps companion&#x27;s given instances. They no longer are orphans and no given import should be needed anymore. - New typeclass instances out of the box (e.g TypeTest instances)

Anyway, now I&#x27;ve done this, I am being prompted every single time I open any project file (first time in session) to import the project root. I removed all caches, removed the old project from the lsp worksapce list, but it&#x27;s not remembering. Any ideas?

                              <span>Anyone have experience of emacs installed on the Steamdeck? It runs steamOS, an Arch derivative and KDE Plasma 
 I&#x27;m a doom and org-mode user on most of my devices.
 I think I can install emacs via the &quot;discover&quot; store on my steamdeck, then I presume, unlock the read-only OS and install the doom config in the usual way.
 Will that work ok? Any pitfalls I should be aware of?
 Anything else I should consider, alternative package managers like Nix for example?

 Left Option does work out-of-the-box.
 I also tried to achieve by setting

 but it didn&#x27;t help.

                              <span>I want a file manager to appear on the side of the screen when I open emacs, like you would have in gedit or atom. I am open to using any package or plugin as long as you can tell me what to put in my init file to make it open when I start emacs.
 Update: It looks like I am able to do it with neotree. I added:  (use-package neotree) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;neotree (neotree-show))  Update 2: Per stackowverflow you can do it with treemacs with:  (use-package treemacs) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook &#x27;treemacs)  I still need to open it once, but then it remembers to be open the next time I start emacs. Counterintuitively, it appears that the with-eval-after-load is necessary for it to be open when it starts, in addition to it having been on the last time I closed it.
 Please do not answer if you are not willing to tell me exactly what to put in my init.el file. I have heard of treemacs but I cannot make emacs open with treemacs open.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve just got Emacs 28.1 running on WSL2. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs on Windows for many years and I now want to switch to WSL for the speed benefit. However, I&#x27;d like to keep the ability to run my Windows installation of Emacs, using the same packages and configuration files as my WSL version. 
 The Home directory for my Windows Emacs installation is C:\Dropbox\Home, therefore I added the following lines to the init.el file loaded by the WSL Emacs installation:
 (setq user-init-file &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs&quot;) (setq user-emacs-directory &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs.d&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs.d/elpa&quot;) 
 The first line works, in that it does read the specified .emacs file. However, when it attempts to load some of the packages (specifically those found in C:\Dropbox\Home\.emacs.d\elpa) it fails, saying it cannot find the file or folder specified. 
 I can&#x27;t figure out where it&#x27;s looking for those packages and why it cannot find them despite me adding the package folders to the load-path var. Any help much appreciated.

 In the left solarized-dark theme, the SVG images exhibit a brown background that blends with the dark theme, resulting in very reduced visibility. 
 Conversely, in the right solarized-light theme, the SVG images display a pleasant light-blue background, offering excellent readability.

 How can SVG images be displayed with a light-blue background in the dark theme, as it is in the light theme?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get Elfeed to work with FreshRSS. I know that the FreshRSS API works correctly because I tested it with an RSS reader on my iPad and iPhone and it syncs correctly with the login/password credentials and the API url.
 However, with Elfeed, I get nothing. I&#x27;m sharing my elfeed setup below in the hopes that someone might let me know if I&#x27;m doing anything wrong.

                              <span>I have the entire elpa directory added into a git repository so that I always have a known good setup that I can fall back on. This works well when I am cloning it in linux machines but when I clone it in windows machines, it doesn’t work.
 I have removed all the .elc files since those are not cross compatible but it still didn’t work and I realise that it’s because the generated autoload file is specified to be using unix style line endings (LF) but when I cloned it in the windows machine, the autoload files will have dos style line endings (CRLF) therefore causing the issue.
 Interestingly, the init file also uses CRLF and it still works presumably because it does not have the same specified coding as the generated autoload files.
 How should I get around this problem? I’m thinking of setting core.autocrlf to false on my windows machine. While that works, I will have to remember to create new files in my .emacs.d with only LF to keep the git repo clean and also presumably for it to work. I also thought about regenerating those autoloads after a clone but I’m not sure how to do so. Hence, I’m looking to see whether others have better solutions to this problem.
 Edit: I realise I can set core.autocrlf to input so that git will automatically convert any CRLF to LF on commit therefore resolving the issue. Regardless, I am still interested to hear from the others who version control their elpa directory on what is their strategy.

                              <span>There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c 
 Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under Task b... only to find its empty.
 A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b 
 The above code shows as:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b 
 Any better solutions?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m learning Scala on Coursera, I&#x27;m getting frustrated with my current issue very early on. I get a compile error for this code &quot;Found: Unit - Required: Boolean&quot;.
 I understand what the error means, basically I am returning void somewhere where I should be returning a Boolean. But I just don&#x27;t see how I am. I&#x27;ve called out all the variables individually to check they all are the types I think they are, and everything just looks fine to me.
 I&#x27;m just counting a List[Char] has the same number of opening and closing braces, I&#x27;ll add functionality to check they actually match later:
 def balance(chars: List[Char]): Boolean &#x3D; checkChar(0, chars) def checkChar(openCount: Int, chars: List[Char]): Boolean &#x3D; val openBrace &#x3D; &quot;(&quot;.toList.head val closeBrace &#x3D; &quot;)&quot;.toList.head val success &#x3D; openCount &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 val newCount &#x3D; if chars.head &#x3D;&#x3D; openBrace then openCount + 1 else if chars.head &#x3D;&#x3D; closeBrace then openCount -1 else openCount if chars.isEmpty then success else checkChar(newCount, chars.tail) // The error is highlighted here 
 The val &quot;success&quot; is a Boolean, and the function checkChar, called recursively, returns a Boolean. Why is it complaining about a Unit?

                              <span>I’m happy to announce the release of vty version 6.0. The highlight of this release is that vty now works on Windows, thanks to hard work by Chris Hackett and Timofey Zakrevskiy! For years, many people in the Haskell community have requested Windows support in vty. Thanks to Chris and Timofey for the time and energy they put into this, and their patience as we worked out an approach! Thanks also to Eric Mertens and Kevin Quick for early feedback on the release.
 In this release, the core &quot;vty&quot; package was reorganized so that support for specific platforms now lives in platform-specific packages that need to be used alongside the core &quot;vty&quot; package. This release includes the release of three aditional new packages:
  
vty-unix (Unix terminal support previously provided by &quot;vty&quot;)
 vty-windows (the Windows backend)
 vty-crossplatform (for when you want to support both)
  
The core package still provides all of the important library functionality and is still a necessary dependency. Applications will need to depend on an additional package for the platform that they need to support. When in doubt, use vty-crossplatform!
 The release changelog update has a detailed listing of changes as well as instructions for how to update your application to work with Vty 6.
 To get help, please open an issue on the Vty repository.
 While I&#x27;m at it, Brick has been updated to use vty-crossplatform in version 2.0!
 Thanks!

My hope is that it will feed into a processes of making breaking changes less severe in the future. If you have come across any breaking changes please let me know here or in an issue or PR on the repo.

                              <span>I had updated to sonoma earlier today on M1 MBA. Emacs became laggy, scrolling through my config file turned into a choppy mess.
 After downgrading back to Ventura, all performance issues were fixed. 
 How to downgrade (in case anyone needs this in the future)
 1. Create Bootable USB Installer and download older macOS version from app store
 2. Make a time machine backup
 3. Reboot into startup options
  
Wipe existing drive, install OS from usb
 
Transfer files from time machine backup.

 I tried searching to see if anyone else had experienced this, but I can&#x27;t find anything. My bad if this is a simple question, but I just haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out.
 It&#x27;s inconvenient, because oftentimes, there is no M-x equivalent of an S-expression, so I have no way to do something that requires a call to an Emacs Lisp function.
 Edit: Solved the problem. Thanks for helping, everyone!See https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/17k6pu4/m_aka_mx_evalexpression_does_nothing_upon_hitting/k76ihco/

                              <span>Hi all, I saw a cool post the other day with a small snippet of code that was asking for reviews. I love the idea and thought I&#x27;d drop in my own little Elisp and ask for the same. This isn&#x27;t a package yet but hoping to make it one. Would love any hints or tips of what&#x27;s expected of a package as I&#x27;ve never made my own and this would be the first. The idea of the package is to have autosave work on an idle timer and trigger immediate save when navigating away in various ways. I&#x27;ve been dogfooding it and so far works great for my needs. Thanks in advance!!

If I now open org-agenda, it takes over the entire frame rather than appearing in one of the windows. Once I close org-agenda I lose the split window configuration. I have figured out how to restore it using winner package, but is it possible to restrict org-agenda to not take the entire frame?

                              <span>I am thinking of moving to mu4e and I was wondering if there is a way to have it group newsletters like &quot;Inbox for Gmail&quot; used to do or like https://sparkmailapp.com does.
 Your regular contacts show up in the inbox and you don&#x27;t have to do much for only real emails appear there. But also real emails from contacts you don&#x27;t know about show up. I assume they read the emails and do some type of automatic filtering. 
 Is this possible in mu4e and if so, now?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to copy images to MacOS Photos App. I know this is probably a rather complex operation, but I also know that there are some die-hard Emacs users out there who use Mac every day. 🍎 So I&#x27;m curious if this is possible? Is there a package? I can&#x27;t seem to find one.
 I&#x27;m just looking for a way to send images via dired directly to MacOS library at the very least. Since I use dirvish to go through photo sets/collections (Color-tagging them with dired-delight), and I find it to be so much faster to do with dired than with a GUI, I&#x27;m just hoping that it&#x27;s possible for emacs to take me &quot;the next step&quot; to moving the marked ones to the photos libraries I have for MacOS. So, any feedback is welcome! thx! 🙃

                              <span>I just noticed that I keep getting the following error when using org-agenda:
 eldoc error: (error ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer # (org-agenda-mode)) 
 So far it doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing any loss of functionality, but I was hoping someone here might be able to point me in the right direction for debugging this.
 Thanks!

                              <span>There is a little Org issue that has been bugging me for quite long. When using Org for task management, subheadings are typically used to define tasks, often grouped under one heading that defines a project. For instance:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a ** TODO Task b * Project 2 ** TODO Task c 
 Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding Project 1, Task b shows as Task b..., i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under &#x60;Task b...&#x60; only to find its empty.
 A compromise is to set org-cycle-separator-lines to 1. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a - [ ] Subtask - [ ] Subtask ** TODO Task b 
 The above code shows as:
 * Project 1 ** TODO Task a... ** TODO Task b

                              <span>The org-manual states that heading Python chunks with &#x60;:results value table&#x60; (see Python Source Code Blocks in Org Mode) will result in a pandas df being output as an org-table. However, that doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my machine.
 For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src python :results value table
 import pandas as pd data &#x3D; {&#x27;State&#x27;:[&#x27;CA&#x27;, &#x27;TX&#x27;, &#x27;FL&#x27;], &#x27;Pop&#x27;:[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(data) return df
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 results in:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +RESULTS:
 | State Pop | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 whereas I was expecting:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +RESULTS:
 | | State | Pop | |---+-------+----------| | 0 | CA | 39029342 | | 1 | TX | 30029572 | | 2 | FL | 22244823 | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In order to get the above, I currently have to use this hacky solution with the tabluate package:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src python :results value raw :return tabulate(df, headers&#x3D;df.columns, tablefmt&#x3D;&#x27;orgtbl&#x27;)
 from tabulate import tabulate import pandas as pd data &#x3D; {&#x27;State&#x27;:[&#x27;CA&#x27;, &#x27;TX&#x27;, &#x27;FL&#x27;], &#x27;Pop&#x27;:[39029342, 30029572, 22244823]} df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(data)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which works as expected. So ... does org-babel support pandas tables and I&#x27;m just doing it wrong, or does it not actually support pandas tables yet?

                              <span>I’ve been happily using org mode for quite awhile now, but this is the first major downside I’ve come across in terms of how it compares to Obsidian. Collectively, these plugins seem to provide a nice way of enforcing a scheme of sorts on your notes and allowing you to surface a dynamic view of your data based on the values of your “schema fields”.
 Does org / org-roam have any analogue to these?

                              <span>Hey. Is anyone able to explain how feasible it is to use GHC as a cross compiler to target Windows x86_64 from a Linux x86_64 host? I know GHC has had some cross compilation abilities for a while but I&#x27;m interested in what the difficulty rating would likely be to use this in production, with modern tools like Stack and GHC 9.x. For context while I understand a bit about how different compiler back ends (such as LLVM) can be used with GHC, things such as trying to build custom instances of GHC from source would score high on my difficulty scale.
 The reason I&#x27;m asking is that I develop a homebrew application that supports Windows and Linux and my Windows machine has suffered a hardware failure, which is serious enough that I may decide to salvage it and build a new machine. I&#x27;m interested in the idea of going Linux only and using cross compilation and WINE as a way to maintain a Windows build environment. Anyway, thanks for reading.

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Haskell with an online course, there was a task to define this fibonacci numbers stream
 fibStream :: [Integer] fibStream &#x3D; 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibStream (drop 1 fibStream) 
 Since lazy evaluation seemed to me do the hard work here I figured I could throw together something similar with Python
 from itertools import islice def fib(): yield 0 yield 1 yield from map(lambda xy: xy[0] + xy[1], zip(fib(), islice(fib(), 1, None))) 
 However, Haskell easily handles even a 1000 elements, while Python is starting to crawl at 31. This doesn&#x27;t look like a tail-call recursion to me. What gives?
 EDIT: all zip, map and islice are lazy AFAIK. fib is a generator function that only evaluates when the next element is demanded.

                              <span>Hi all!
 Thought I would showcase an early version of mouse, a small HTTP server library I have been working on this week.
 The general idea is that it&#x27;s supposed to be small and simple, not fully featured, but it&#x27;s also not supposed to get in your way, that&#x27;s why the &quot;DSL&quot; is pretty heavily ingrained into the regular usage. It also has no dependencies (aside from scalatest).
 I intend on improving things like performance and adding a few features to make it a bit nicer before making it to 1.0. A few things to expect:
  
HTTP Client library
 Route testing library
 WebSocket support
 HTTP 2.0 support
 TLS configuration
  
Please feel free to leave your thoughts and if you find any issues, please feel free to open one.

                              <span>emacs_without_a_keyboard was an interesting read - so how about emacs on chromebooks?
 I had a cursory look at the chromebook keyboard and got scared - is it like Mac where the keys have different names but similar functions? 
 Perhaps there are config changes or packages needed? 
 Perhaps it&#x27;s as different as evil vs holy modes?
 Or is it basically impossible to use emacs on chromebooks?

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 Hope your weekend is off to a great start. I&#x27;m starting my journey on Vim and possibly Emacs (although, who am I kidding, seeing some of its capabilities it seems an inevitability). One thing that would accelerate my timeline to jumping into learning Emacs is if it handled a particular use case that is crucial to me.
 See, I do a lot of work in Jupyter Notebooks (Python) for school and ML/prototyping in general. One thing I like about notebooks is that if you make a mistake and the program fails, well, your intermediate calculations are still stored in memory and accessible. It&#x27;s a graceful fail. If you fail through terminal, well, could be the end of what you calculated. 
 The problem I have with Jupyter Notebooks is that they do not support parallel processing conveniently. I saw that Emacs has some interesting capabilities around notebook support; I believe org mode is what&#x27;s used. 
 I was interested in knowing if anyone uses Emacs as a way to get the best of both worlds: a way to run things using multiprocessing, but should things fail, it store the states in memory to rerun it.
 I appreciate any/all insight you have!

                              <span>Is there a solution for inserting a filename to a buffer (either to a normal buffer, or to the minibuffer) using a recursive fuzzy search, using the vertico + consult + corfu + cape ecosystem? Something like what consult-find does, but instead of opening the selected file, insert the path of it to a buffer.
 We have cape-file, but it doesn&#x27;t fuzzy search in a recursive way.

 wait, it was in the C-c keymap. Let&#x27;s cancel this keybinding by... um... pressing ESC repeatedly?
 C-x ESC ESC: executes (repeat-complex-command)
  
How can one cancel the current key chain in Emacs? I also tried C-x C-g but i get a message C-x C-g is undefined which makes me think that it isn&#x27;t reserved for this kind of purpose.

                              <span>After having used org-agenda just for my todos and scheduled events, I just found out one can use it to search one&#x27;s notes too. It works great! With one bad side-effect. I added several org directories using:
 (setq org-agenda-text-search-extra-files (directory-files-recursively &quot;~/Writer/&quot; &quot;\\.org$&quot;))
 Now, after searching, all the files the agenda had opened to look for my search string have been added to the list of recent files. So (find-file (completing-read &quot;Recent files: &quot; recentf-list)) becomes less useful because it doesn&#x27;t show the latest opened files on top of the list anymore, but instead a complete list of all my org-files.
 Is there a way to prevent agenda search from caching files into recentf-list?
 Thank you very much for any help!

 (not including the fact that Microsoft owns vscode and that some parts are not open source, im aware of that, so no need to mention it)

                              <span>Hi Emacs community,
 I&#x27;m an elisp noob, and I recently wrote a function to get the references on a wikipedia page. I plan on using it for org-mode/org-roam so I can do research faster (even though there&#x27;s probably already a package for that sort of thing). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s probably not as robust as I would like to think it is, as some of the dois/isbns appear to be missing in some wikipedia pages I&#x27;ve tested. Here it is for reference:
 (defun get-wikipedia-references (subject) &quot;Gets references for a wikipedia article&quot; (let ((wikipedia-prefix-url &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot;)) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously (concat wikipedia-prefix-url subject)) (let* ((html-start (progn (goto-char (point-min)) (re-search-forward &quot;^$&quot;))) (dom (libxml-parse-html-region (1+ (point)) (…</span>

                              <span>These are a few project ideas that I&#x27;ve had but will probably never get around to so I thought I&#x27;d post them. The general concept is to use existing projects to handle some of the details and make it easier to experiment with the unique features of the language. These ideas also try to avoid a lot of the standard web application implementation details that are usually covered in courses or books.
 ​
  
Write a ui for hledger https://hledger.org/ . One already exists, but if you store the transactions as text blobs in a database and dump out hledger text files based on different things you want to do you could experiment with: 
 Making projections by generating future transaction entries
 Running &quot;what if&quot; scenarios by filtering out past transactions and replacing them with generated transactions
 Different ways of tagging/categorizing/automating transactions 
 
 Write a toy version of Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/ . Create a file format that describes a set of containers, read the file format, and use the shell &#x60;docker&#x60; (or &#x60;podman&#x60;) command to poll/start/stop the containers. You can experiment with different ways to start up different subsets of containers, ways of swapping different types of containers for different roles ...etc.
 Write a ui for MegaMek https://megamek.org/ . One already exists but mostly the idea is to use the existing game rules implementation and focus on experimenting with language features. Not sure how feasible this one is.
 Implement the ActivityPub protocol to create a Mastodon server. Not sure how good this one is for learning but there are probably a lot of interesting choices to make.

 With the help and tips from you, I think I&#x27;ve managed to make this tic-tac-toe game look less Pythonic...
 I will let you be the judge of that, and I accept any and all criticism. I wish to know what I could do to make this look even more idiomatic. Go ham!
 Since I now use recursion instead of loops, and the way I handled certain statements, it is not exactly the same as my last version, but it plays virtually the same.
 The code feels much less verbose and much cleaner now. I love it, but I&#x27;m sure I can do better with a second refactor after gaining some insight again!
 I still feel like I&#x27;m underutilizing certain things like Option, but it&#x27;s a step up.

                              <span>Hi
 I have picked Scala as my first language, but am unable to find any courses/ resources that focus on functional programming for absolute beginners i.e. people who have no background in programming at all. There are beginner level courses that teach Scala with OOP. Courses/resources that teach functional style assume experience in Java or some other language. Why are there no Scala functional programming courses/resources for absolute beginners?

 Coming from mainly Python, I decided to look into Scala after having dabbled in some Ocaml and Haskell. I am still very FP-curious and my Python-code is starting to be cluttered with maps and reductions, not to mention lambdas. Scala looks to be very elegant, aesthetically and otherwise.
 I recently made tic-tac-toe in Python for a Uni introductory programming course, so that&#x27;s what I tried to make here, having barely looked at the &#x27;getting started&#x27;-docs.
 import scala.io.StdIn.readLine import Math.floorMod case class Pos(val x: Int, val y: Int): def fromInput: Pos &#x3D; Pos(floorMod(x-1, 3), floorMod(3-y, 3)) end Pos class Board: private var b: List[List[Int]] &#x3D; { for i &lt;- 0 until 3 yield { for j &lt;- 0 until 3 yield 0}.toList }.toList def board: List[List[Int]] …</span>

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I discovered that sociologists who study leisure classify me as a Literary Leisure Hobbyist. I had no idea. My PKM work feeds that part of my persona.
Rucking as an old man
How my Blind-side Bias develops and the effect it has on me.
If you do what so few people do, what you do can have superlinear performance returns.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Calvino, Italo. Invisible Cities. 2013.
Attia, Peter and Gifford, Bill. Outlive: the science &amp; art of longevity. 2023.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Peter Pearson
Jazz Saxophone Playlist

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>Probably better for r/showerthoughts - but is anyone using emacs without a keyboard?
 I assume the core audience of emacs is devs and sysadmins (and perhaps academics with org and org roam) 
 But surely somebody somewhere is doing those jobs / using assistive tech (dragon etc?) to interface with emacs?

                              <span>I came across citar, and I am trying to use citar-org-roam to take notes on academic papers. I must be missing something about usage/configuration. I get &quot;Make sure &#x27;citar-notes-paths&#x27; and &#x27;citar-file-note-extensions&#x27; are non-nil&quot; when I try to use citar-open-notes. If I set the &#x27;citar-notes-paths&#x27; variable, then citar creates normal notes without using the template defined above.
 Here&#x27;s what is in my init.el:
 (use-package org-roam :custom (org-roam-directory &quot;~/RoamNotes&quot;) (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t) (&quot;n&quot; &quot;literature note&quot; plain &quot;* Heading\n %?&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%(expand-file-name (or citar-org-roam-subdir \&quot;\&quot;) org-roam-directory)/${citar-citekey}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${citar-citekey} (${citar-date}). ${note-title}.\n#+created: %U\n#+last_modified: %U\n\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t))) :bind ((&quot;C-c n l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c n f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c n g&quot; . org-roam-graph) (&quot;C-c n i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert) (&quot;C-c n c&quot; . org-roam-capture) (&quot;C-c n j&quot; . org-roam-dailies-capture-today) :map org-mode-map (&quot;C-M-i&quot; . completion-at-point)) :config (setq org-roam-node-display-template (concat &quot;${title:*} &quot; (propertize &quot;${tags:10}&quot; &#x27;face &#x27;org-tag))) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) (require &#x27;org-roam-protocol)) (use-package citar :custom (citar-bibliography &#x27;(&quot;~/bib/referencess.bib&quot;)) :hook (LaTeX-mode . citar-capf-setup) (org-mode . citar-capf-setup)) (use-package citar-org-roam :after (citar org-roam) :config (setq citar-org-roam-note-title-template &quot;${author} - ${title}&quot;) (setq citar-org-roam-capture-template-key &quot;n&quot;) (citar-org-roam-mode))

                              <span>I am trying to replace straight with Elpaca but I have some troubles with loading some of my local packages that are not from Melpa.
 The use-case is to load laas a package for latex snippets. I use the following code
 ​
 (use-package aas :elpaca nil :load-path (lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory)) ) (use-package laas :elpaca nil :load-path (lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory)) :config (aas-set-snippets &#x27;laas-mode ;; set condition! :cond #&#x27;texmathp ; expand only while in math &quot;On&quot; &quot;O(n)&quot; &quot;O1&quot; &quot;O(1)&quot; ;; bind to functions! &quot;Sum&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\sum_{$1}^{$2} $0&quot;)) &quot;Span&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\Span($1)$0&quot;)) &quot;lr(&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left($0\\right)&quot;)) &quot;lr[&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left[$0\\right]&quot;)) &quot;lr{&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (yas-expand-snippet &quot;\\left\\{$0\\right\\}&quot;)) ) (laas-mode) ) 
 ​
 Both files &#x60;aas.el&#x60; and &#x60;laas.el&#x60; are in my &#x60;(lambda () (expand-file-name &quot;custom/&quot; user-emacs-directory))&#x60; durectory and with straight these lines of code worked well but when I switched to Elpaca, laas was not loaded anymore. I tried to add :after tex, do not change anything. I tried to add a hook for latex mode and it also do not change, the laas package is not even loaded.
 Can someone help me with this please?

 Is it possible to combine the two in a simple way? I tried using :general keyword in use-package ensuring that it loads after general, but it still does not work...
 Below is what I tried.
  (use-package elfeed :after general :general (:prefix &quot;M-m&quot; &quot;w&quot; #&#x27;elfeed))

 UPDATE: Thank you all for answers. I&#x27;ve worked around this issue by removing parts of the custom-theme-set-faces! and editing color values directly in the
 I still don&#x27;t understand how faces/fonts and their styles are supposed to work in emacs, but I&#x27;m in the middle of transition from KDE wayland to Hyprland and there are already way way way too many issues to deal with. Fingers crossed this won&#x27;t break this time.

                              <span>According to the GitHub page, the org-journal package does not (yet) support having multiple journals. But the author does say:
  
But it should be possible to switch the value of org-journal-directory using a custom function or directory local variables.
  
Has anyone done this, or something similar? I currently use journaling for most (generally basic) notes, but I am also working on a research project for which I&#x27;d like to keep the related journal entries co-located with the project files. That is, my &quot;primary&quot; journal is kept on Dropbox, but I&#x27;d like the project journal to be in the GitHub repo I&#x27;ve set up.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m interested and new to learn the Clash for hardware development but I don&#x27;t have any functional programming experience. Thus, I jumped started from what the following article taught. First, it&#x27;s to install the stack and run the Clash over the stack as shown below.
 However, it seems the Clash version is really old. If I&#x27;d like to use latest Clash version which it may have latest library, what should I do? I&#x27;ve already install the following version and works in my Ubuntu environment. On top of that, is there any online cloud-based way to run Clash? Thank you

 ％stack install --resolver lts-9.21 clash-ghc-0.7.2

                              <span>So my BT keyboard + trackpad is looking worse for wear.
 It was cheap and cheerful with a winning form factor. Other KBs came and went, but it survived.
 I need a replacement.
 It&#x27;s been used with emacs (DooM) with my tablet and / or phone for a few years, and has a few shortcomings (see yellow sticker).
 I now also have a SteamDeck, which is basically an Arch box, and I&#x27;d love a BT keyboard with that.
 Does anyone have a portable setup they&#x27;d like to share? 
 Also, is there an emacs-y way to lisp my way out of things like:
  
keys being missing (#);
 ESC being on a function layer?

I&#x27;m wondering if it would be possible to speed it up using some other tool such as &#x60;fd&#x60;. I noticed that the consult README talks about &#x60;consult-fd&#x60; but I cannot locate that function anywhere in my version which is I think the latest &#x60;0.35&#x60;. Can anyone help with this?
 Also, similarly, consult-grep is a bit slow. Wondering if one can swap in &#x60;ag&#x60; for example?

I have to kill and yank the heading to get it working again. I pasted some of my init file below incase that helps.
  
I&#x27;ve tried this with flyspell disabled and get the same results, so i think it is an ispell issue.
 I have also tried this with emacs -q and running M-x ispell and get the same issue. 
 I&#x27;m using emacs+ on mac

In the theme code there&#x27;s a variable (mode-line-padding 10) which I assume sets the width of the mode line. Is there a way for me to reset this value in my init file, either before or after loading the theme code, to make it narrower? I&#x27;m using the code below to load it.
 (use-package adwaita-dark-theme :ensure t :config (load-theme &#x27;adwaita-dark t))

                              <span>Hi, I heard about Pieces.app on the Software Engineering podcast today, and I was wondering how others handle the logging or journaling of snapshot coding and research material in Org Mode. (I use org mode for practically everything in my note-taking, journaling and work tracking)
 I do, as the podcast describes, search for code snippets and pointers or ideas when prototyping code, sometimes it is content I can use right away or it can be something I just think is neat and possibly use in the future. But I don&#x27;t have what I think is a great way of storing and retrieving this material.
 I use org-dailies every day for journaling and tag the posts for high-level topics, and org-roam for my comprehensive reading and research. But for programming journaling this really is me remembering to file the write-up (in org-daillies) at the end of the day or work on a project on that day, but it&#x27;s not ideal for capturing quick text notes or excerpts from web pages etc. 
 Are there good ways to track short snippet-like research detail and even auto-tag the entries with language, target project etc. in org mode?

                              <span>I rather like the deadline functionality and it works great for most shorter term things. I&#x27;ve been building out a goals file that is working quite well. I don&#x27;t have any todo&#x27;s directly in the file but I do like using the deadline functionality to highlight upcoming goals. 
 This works quite well for shorter term goals where I might set it to be 2w - 1mo out to keep it on my radar. It would be nifty if I could map out a few milestones for a goal/project that is longer term such that it will populate on my agenda in a nice highlighted color. 
 I&#x27;ve tried recurring deadlines and setting multiple deadlines but those do not quite work. 
 Any ideas on how to approach this or a starting point to implement this?

                              <span>I wrote this little library to get a fast Haskell implementation of the Myers diff algorithm, which serves as the base of most diffing tools today. This version is basically an adaptation of some Python code from this excellent post, using as many performance tricks as I can.
 It has QuickCheck tests and I&#x27;ve just added some benchmarks to compare it to the existing Diff library. For any performance wizards out there, the core code is quite short and can be found here -- PRs welcome!

                              <span>When you are using a FUNCTOR you are mapping CATEGORIES. Think about that.
 You can think about.. each functor having one category for each argument/result.
 Let&#x27;s describe an arbitrary functor: FunOf (-&gt;) (:~:) () F, this notation describes the categories that F maps.
 The functor F maps three source categories (-&gt;), (:~:) @Type, () using the mapping function mapF:
 F :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | | (-&gt;) (:~:) () @Type mapF :: (a -&gt; a&#x27;) -&gt; (b :~: b&#x27;) -&gt; (c  (F a b c -&gt; F a&#x27; b&#x27; c&#x27;) 
 Each category maps its respective argument/result: 
 F (a :: Type) (b :: Type) (c :: Type) &#x3D; (res :: Type) | | | | (-&gt;) (:~:) () | | | | v v v v F (a&#x27; :: Type) (b&#x27; :: Type) (c&#x27; :: Type) &#x3D; (res&#x27; :: Type) F F (a :: Type) -&gt; (a&#x27; :: Type) (b…</span>

 I&#x27;ve just begun learning Haskell, and when looking for ressources, I&#x27;ve seen &quot;What I wish I knew when learning Haskell&quot; from Stephen Diehl recommended quite a lot. However, it seems that the hosting site is down, and I&#x27;ve waited but it doesnt seem to come back up. Does anyone know what&#x27;s up, or could send it to me?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>So first off here&#x27;s the code
 import scala.collection.parallel.CollectionConverters._
 import scala.util.Random
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; {
 val size &#x3D; 1000000
 val tests &#x3D; 5
 val lists &#x3D; for _  x)
 (xs.min to xs.max).par.flatMap(cnts.getOrElse(_, List.empty)).seq
 }
 ​
 the sorting algorithm essentially just groups the input by the identity function and then flatMaps all the groups in order by key. The problem is though when I run this code, the first test finishes and then subsequent tests significantly outperform the first one normally by a factor of 2 or 3. For example on the most recent time I ran this the output was 1632, 904, 696, 605, 722. My only guesses as to why this is are either a caching issue, an issue with System.currentTimeMilis(), or perhaps the compiler being smart about how much space it allocates for the map on subsequent tests based on results from previous tests, but I really have no clue and am wondering if someone has a better guess than me.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I am a recruiter at a Signify Technology. I am sure most of you are familiar with us and have been reached out to by one or more of my co-workers in the past for a job.
 The market this year has a been a complete rollercoaster this year, with a ton of layoffs across the entire tech industry and people are struggling to find another role inside the Scala space. Because of the current market conditions, we have noticed inconsistencies between the skills of the engineers vs the compensation packages offered to candidates in this market.
 Therefore, we are conducting an anonymous survey surrounding compensation packages so we can get accurate data to reflect on from last year to see what the difference is. This is completely anonymous, requires no identifying information and only takes roughly 3 minutes to complete.
 If you have the time, we encourage you to take the survey and appreciate any responses to it. Thanks again and enjoy the rest of your day!

I know few apps have this feature but if you had to guess, what would be the &quot;ratio&quot; or read/write in your notes.
I ask this because I&#x27;m working on a [[Knowledge Management]] concept where this ration is extremely important.
I would say mine is 40/60. 40% writing and 60% reading the notes of total time.</span>

                              <span>I know this question has been asked before and I know about org-roam, I am just not sure if org-roam is the right solution for me. Right now, I use one big org file to take notes which I export to pdf. This works nicely, but it would be nice to also have access to the concepts in the larger org file at a granular level (ie. bite-sized notes which reference one another and are organized based on their subject matter). I would also like to tag information that is not in org format, if possible. I was thinking that org-roam &amp; org-transclusion could be used to make main subject files, while org-roam could be used to make a link to an embedded pdf that comes from the concept I am referencing, when I don&#x27;t need to explicitly review the material in whatever notes I am taking. Has anybody done anything like this? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks.

 Thanks to /u/alphapapa for good data for this purpose.
 I&#x27;ve attached what mine looks like, but basically just default modus dark theme.
 Why? If you live in your org-agenda, you probably care about how it looks to some extent.
 Maybe we can share cool parts that improve our living spaces :)

 Is there any version that works well on the older OSes?

Export org as HTML (to a temp buffer);
 Render the HTML to a browser, my default browser or eww.

                              <span>Hi.
 Ainother day, another emacs doubt.
 I&#x27;m using ivy-mode, and when I do M-x and write, the order of candidates for completion seems weird for me. I figure it obeys some logic, but I&#x27;d like to change it. For example:
 I do M-x and write coun bu
 Results are:
 counsel-switch-buffer (this one is selected by default)
 counsel-ibuffer
 counsel-buffer-or-recentf
 counsel-minibuffer-history
 For me, counsel-buffer-or-recent should be the first candidate, since that&#x27;s the one with shortest &quot;distance&quot; between a match for coun and a match for bu. Is there a way to make results be sorted by this? So that those 4 candidate should appear like:
 counsel-buffer-or-recentf
 counsel-ibuffer
 counsel-minibuffer-history
 counsel-switch-buffer
 Another example. I make M-x package-install then write consu. There are almost 15 results before consult. Being the shortest one matching perfectly the string, IMHO this should be the first candidate.
 Another example, M-x dire. Results:
 A couple of logical results (because they start with dired-)
 tramp-crypt-add-directory
 dired-jump-other-window
 How is it that dired-jump appears after tramp-crypt-add-directory if the match for dire is further in the tramp-... candidate?
 Any hint on this? 
 Thanks in advance.

 Checking here to see if anyone else has experienced this.
 I searched the GNU bug tracker and (tbh I might not have searched in the right way) but I didn&#x27;t find anything.

                              <span>I am trying to use dired on Windows. But, when I attempt to follow a shortcut in dired, it seems to open the shortcut file itself in a buffer instead of following the shortcut to the target directory.
 I attempted to follow the installation instructions in this file starting on line 51: https://github.com/hidsh/elisp/blob/master/w32-symlinks.el.
 When I byte-compiled the w32-symlinks.el file, Emacs informed me that there were incorrectly escaped quotes in the function located on line 171. I removed those parts of the docstring and byte-compiled the file without error. I also used the following code as specified in the directions.
 (add-hook &#x27;dired-load-hook
 (lambda () (require &#x27;w32-symlinks)))
 But, when I use dired to follow a Windows shortcut it still opens it as a file. 
 Is there another file explorer package that I can use? Is there another solution?
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>Hey there.
 I&#x27;m a fan of Emacs, like you folks.
 I use Emacs org every day, mainly for my teaching class. Furthermore, I learn Emacs for three years ago.
 But I struggle to achieve my learning of Elisp. For example, taping lisp and elisp code with evil/lispy is a true nightmare (I use Prelude with few modes, btw), not to mention when I type code block within org.
 I knew the learning curve is hard. But I didn&#x27;t expect that much frustration to learn it. The documentation is austere. So few examples are given. There is too little blogs or books about Emacs, specifically about org and babel.
 To illustrate my point, let&#x27;s take the *this* variable in babel, that I found TODAY by CHANCE in this page : https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html.
 It&#x27;s a game changer for a lot of my code, and would deserve a whole page to illustrate it. But no, it&#x27;s given in a «niche» example.
 Don&#x27;t be mistaken, I found Babel/Org/Emacs wonderful, but what a pain in the ass to learn it !
 For such an old and wise piece of software, I can&#x27;t understand why we don&#x27;t have a smooth learning experience with Emacs. A lot of people could benefit Org/Emacs, without the big hinder of the «lack» of documentation (mostly examples).
 Am I the only one to experience this ?
 Edit : *this* is not a &quot;kind of macro&quot; but simply a variable. Thanks u/oantolin.

 I enabled it quickly in emacs using spurcell&#x27;s emacs-reformatter mode:
 (use-package reformatter :hook (python-mode . ruff-format-on-save-mode) (python-ts-mode . ruff-format-on-save-mode) :config (reformatter-define ruff-format :program &quot;ruff&quot; :args &#x60;(&quot;format&quot; &quot;--stdin-filename&quot; ,buffer-file-name &quot;-&quot;)))

                              <span>It seems Typelevel is having a diversity panel at their event. Here are a couple of relevant questions in case anyone attending wants to ask: 
  
Travis Brown and several Typelevel members have targeted individuals from minority groups as &quot;collateral damage&quot; in their disputes with JdG over the years. Considering the significant psychological distress this has caused on multiple occasions, and Travis&#x27; close association with Typelevel&#x27;s leadership, will the steering committee address and condemn his cyberstalking tactics? Should the community be concerned about it happening again? 
 
Over the years, Typelevel&#x27;s approach to cancellation campaigns has often been riddled by conflicts of interest, as targets were direct competitors. Are there plans to establish a more principled framework to govern such actions? Particularly when individuals from minority groups are involved, can the community expect decisions to be fair and thoroughly considered?

                              <span>At work we use Akka + zio-1 for our backend services and use datadog java agent to instrument our micro services. I couldn’t find any specific project in datadog agent code base that tries to instrument zio fibers for zio1. But automagically spans are created and propagated downstream correctly across forked fibers that are executed on different threads. I’ve been digging around , debugging to see how datadog is able to correctly propagate the spans but no luck. Can some one help me understand how that is possible? We don’t use zio telemetry or open tracing libraries in these micro services.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a data engineer who has worked mostly in Python. I have some academic experience in C/C++. I&#x27;ve tried learning Spark in the past through a book, but wasn&#x27;t picking up the concepts. I came across rockthejvm through this sub. He sells a Spark course, but in the FAQ, he doesn&#x27;t recommend doing the Spark course if you haven&#x27;t learned Scala. So I started with the Scala course. I&#x27;m finding the explanations to go superficially deep, and explaining a lot of concepts. I&#x27;m in the generics lesson right now, and I&#x27;m looking back at the older lessons, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to complete the exercises on my own after some time.
 Is there a better way? The best way for me in the past is to just come up with a project and start coding. My ultimate goal is to learn Spark well. If that means getting a decent fluency in Scala, then I&#x27;m ok with it, but I&#x27;m just not picking up the concepts of Scala well with this learning method.

In the notes.org I have this snippet which execute for this reading session. I read multiple articles in a session and want to place the collected quotes under respective Article titles instead of &quot;Reading&quot; as configured below. How do I dynamically extract title from EWW and force org-capture to place the note under that title and create an entry for that title if it does not exist in notes.org file. 
 Also is it possible to replace the static filename, and instead dynamically get current filepath so that the template can be reused without editing?

                              <span>Help!
 I have recently transitioned to a custom workflow that relies on org-agenda to track progress on all the projects my team is working on. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy about it: I have a cron job that polls the jira server for updated tickets and refreshes a cache of org files, one per ticket. I wrote my Jira-org bridge and I render jira comments and changelog items one per org item with timestamps, and org-agenda does a fantastic job at showing me all updates, from the respective users. I can open any day and see very nicely what everybody in the team has done. I press capital E and I can even see excerpts of the comments they posted. So far, absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s literally better and faster than using the Atlassian tools in the web.
 Two things I don&#x27;t like:
 (1) - all the org files are opened as individual buffers. It&#x27;s hundreds of them. Low hundreds but still hundreds. I understand that org-agenda needs to index and reindex them, and also needs to &quot;remotely&quot; update their contents from the agenda view... but why keep them open in a buffer all the time? Can&#x27;t org be configured to lazy open them only on a change?
 (2) - initial indexing is slow and will likely get slower every week. I don&#x27;t mind it for now, because it&#x27;s a price I only pay on a monday morning, and I can even hide it under the emacs server start that I do in crontab @ reboot... but I&#x27;m concerned about the long term sustainability of the solution. By nature, jira tickets will keep growing and growing over time. I only index the ones incurring active changes... but still. Is there a way to better control indexing costs? Is there a way to speed things up? Navigating from one week to another is starting to be a little slow. Yes this is hundreds of tickets and thousands of events, but in 2023 that&#x27;s nothing in terms of data sizes contemporary software handles. Are there tricks to speed org-agenda up?

Diverk: a Reflex app to browse GitHub repos by jecaro
That’s a super simple app that allows you to browse and search in the default branch of a GitHub repo. It can render markdown files. I’m a big note taker and all the notes I take live in a private git repo in this format. That was an additional motivation for me to do this project.
More traversals and more Cabal SAT by Oleg Grenrus

                              <span>Tweag is excited to announce the first release of nixtract 0.1.0!
This is our first step towards a broader effort to make Nix the best tool to tackle tomorrow’s challenges of the Software Supply Chain.
In order to understand why we need nixtract, let me tell you about the “secret” value of Nixpkgs.

Is it a bird? A plane? It’s a graph!
The Nix language allows you to define the “recipe” to build anything into a package, like the sources and the steps to make the package, but also the dependencies it needs to build.
For instance we can define the recipe for a package that depends on zlib.

 Echo buffer status in minibuffer window, get rid of mode-line.
 features: - light-weight, very simple structure and no many configs compared to feebleline, mini-mdoeline, awesome-tray... - don&#x27;t use mode-line at all, same experience in terminal - port lots of segments from doom-modeline
 Have a try!

                              <span>I built Emacs 29.1 from source a few months ago and it was working pretty smoothly as far as I could tell -- I was mainly using the elfeed-webkit package -- until I tried to use it today and my Emacs session crashed. I was mainly using it in daemon mode, but evem just running emacs -Q and then M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url RET wikipedia.org results in the error at the end of this post (sorry for the wall of text).
 From the EmacsWiki and from reading /etc/PROBLEMS, I tried to use xwidgets-webkit again with SNAP&#x3D;1 SNAP_NAME&#x3D;1 SNAP_REVISION&#x3D;1 emacs -Q, but it results in the same error.
 It&#x27;s probably an issue with my system rather than Emacs -- I&#x27;m running this on Manjaro Linux, and emacs-version gives:
 GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.38, cairo version 1.17.8…</span>

                              <span>Thanks to Andreas (the original author of gccmacs), we can now &quot;redump&quot; Emacs even with some natively compiled elisp in the mix. I&#x27;ve been cautious in my experiments so far, but: this works on Windows!
 From a MSYS2/MINGW64 bash shell:
 $ bin/emacs --batch -Q -eval &#x27;(let ((custom-theme-load-path (list &quot;
/.emacs.d/elpa/cyberpunk-2019-theme-20191008.1133/&quot;))) (require &#x27;&quot;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;erc) (load-theme &#x27;&quot;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;cyberpunk-2019 t) (enable-theme &#x27;&quot;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;cyberpunk-2019) (dump-emacs-portable &quot;erc.pdmp&quot;))&#x27;
 $ bin/runemacs.exe --dump-file erc.pdmp -fs -l 
 This seems to get a &quot;fullboth&quot; frame with my theme pretty fast. Note, I can&#x27;t trigger connection quite yet at that point; the runemacs call is loading my full init, and some parts that take a further moment. 
 Also, the first command, which created the custom portable dump called &quot;erc.pdump&quot; loaded by the second command, was nearly instant. Here&#x27;s a look at what this did to size of the the pdmp file.

                              <span>I want to write a script to process the contents of a text file line by line, and came across this example on Emacs wiki - https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BatchMode
 emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (eval (read))))&quot;
 So I adjusted it to emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (read)))&quot; and the prompt Lisp expression: is always displayed.
 ─○ emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (read)))&quot; Lisp expression: fdfdfds fdfdfds Lisp expression: dsfdsfdfds Lisp expression: ^C% 
 When I try a command like cat text1.txt | emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (read)))&quot; it barfs completely, so read is definitely not the function for this, unless I&#x27;m failing to pass some necessary options to it.

                              <span>I have been learning haskell through CIS 194, which was the first thing that was suggested on the Next Steps page on haskell&#x27;s official website. I&#x27;ve read the material for the introduction section, and I&#x27;m now on the first homework. 
 Among other things, one of our tasks is to create a function, doubleEveryOther :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer], that multiplies every other element in a list by 2, starting from the last element. For instance:
 doubleEveryOther [8,7,6,5] &#x3D;&#x3D; [16,7,12,5] doubleEveryOther [1,2,3] &#x3D;&#x3D; [1,4,3] 
 As a side note, so far we have learned about basic the list operations (described in Learn You a Haskell § starting out): head, tail, last, ... as well as the colons operator : and the ++ operator. 
 So far, the only way I&#x27;ve been able to vaguely define this function is as follow…</span>

                              <span>I was poking around and opened up the README.org file in the Doom Emac&#x27;s faust module and i saw these nifty nagivation things that weren&#x27;t coming form within the file. I didn&#x27;t see anything in the directory that hinted at it (to me) either.
 Can someone please point me to instructions for this? I&#x27;m not ever sure what I should be searching for.
 ​
 edit: this file is where the things are coming from but i don&#x27;t understand how one would construct something like this from scratch or how the pieces fit together.

                              <span>This is going to be lengthy post. I hope someone can help me. I&#x27;m quite new to Haskell, and I&#x27;m not sure where to go from here.
 Recently, as a personal learning project, I decided to write a small virtual memory scanner PeepingTom, similar in behavior to ScanMem, or Cheat Engine.
 It works. I have managed to use it in several games to give myself money, points or whatever. I even have a video demonstration using Hotline Miami in the github page, and automatic tests to ensure that, under the default options, we match the scan results of ScanMem.
 There is one problem though: The initial scan is REALLY slow. 
 I just did a small test using Hotline Miami.
 Scanmem took about 3-4 seconds to scan the entire (filtered) virtual memory. Scanning for the same data types (Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64)…</span>

                              <span>In a 2 window setup, is there a way to make all temporary popup buffers (help, compile, occur, etc) always open in a specific window?
 For example, I have a left and right window. I do most of my work in the left window. When I lookup something in help it opens in the right window which is what I want.
 But let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m in the right window already and look up help, it will open in the left window. Is there a way to make it always open in the right?

 Drag files into dired
 That is effective.
 Emacs has been my faithful companion for over 5 years, and I just stumbled upon this remarkable feature minutes ago.
 Typically, I rely on async-shell-commands to open the current buffer directory in Windows 10&#x27;s File Manager, then move files from folder to folder.
 But, now, this seeming-trival discovery has greatly enhanced my workflow, instill in me a strong sence that Emacs not only coexists within the operating system, but rather embodies the operating system itself.
 While it is true that Windows does not support dragging files from dired buffer to external locations, but I seldom encounter such a requirement in my day-to-day workflows.
 Have you ever had such an experience that discovered an amazing feature after a long time using Emacs？what is it?

                              <span>For about three years now, I&#x27;ve been using org-super-links, but I&#x27;m getting tired of updating its dependencies that I don&#x27;t use (such as helm, and now it seems to need org-super-agenda too). 
 Recently, its searches also started utilizing helm regex search, which is very slow crawling through all my files as it tries to find a match in real time. I&#x27;m unsure if this is a new-ish addition, or perhaps it&#x27;s because I integrated helm more fully within Emacs after org-super-links complained it needed it.
 I&#x27;m looking for a substitute, something that just creates backlinks from the org-mode header ID I&#x27;m standing on. I&#x27;m not interested in org-roam, a big new package that feels like a whole new org-mode built on top of the existing one; I want to go the other way and use something basic. 
 I wonder if anyone here knows of an Emacs built-in solution or something close to it? Does it exist? It feels like such an elementary thing these days it&#x27;s odd it doesn&#x27;t exist..?

                              <span>Is TypeScript a game-changer in web development? We believe, yes. This statically typed superset of JavaScript is designed to scale up the language, making it more robust and maintainable.  While JavaScript is known for its flexibility, TypeScript brings in the added advantage of type safety, reducing the potential for runtime errors. If you work with JavaScript and want to enhance the reliability of your code and provide more predictable and stable tooling to your customers, TypeScript is the right option.</span>

                              <span>I love git worktrees. It took me a while to change my workflow and get used to doing things differently, but it is so much better. I never have to think &quot;oh my repo is in inconsistent state, I can&#x27;t switch my focus and start reviewing this PR, I need to first stash/commit/stage/etc. my stuff...&quot;
 I also love how Magit lets me create a worktree from a PR or an Issue (some of that is built-in, some I extended to fit my workflow). One thing is still missing though.
 Cloning or starting a new repo in a practical way to be used with worktrees, for me, always requires some manual process.
 First, I need to follow the recommendation I borrowed from this blogpost: How to use git worktree and in a clean way. It boils down to:
 mkdir my-awesome-project $ cd my-awesome-project $ git clone --bare git@github.com:myname:my-awesome-project.git .bare $ echo &quot;gitdir: ./.bare&quot; &gt; .git 
 But when I do that, git doesn&#x27;t see remote branches anymore. So some stuff won&#x27;t work as normally expected. For that, I have to follow this advice from SO, basically adding to ./bare/config:
 [remote &quot;origin&quot;] fetch &#x3D; +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* 
 And now I&#x27;m thinking, before I try to automate this. Maybe Magit already does the right thing and I just never knew about it? Or maybe it&#x27;s much simpler than that and all that manual hocus-pocus is not needed?
 How do you use worktrees with Magit? And if you don&#x27;t use worktreees, why is that? Is there even a better way?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 u/daviwil had released an excellent video in his System Crafters channel, where he showed how to hack org-roam:
 https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/5-org-roam-hacks/
 I have copied his code into my config (the function that allows to create a TODO in a project file that we select (or create if not existing) is very useful.
 I want to create a similar one: I want to create an event in a select customer file and to create this customer file if it does not exist.
 The filter of the nodes with the tags &quot;customer&quot; works, but I am stuck with the definition of the content to insert as the event:
 - I want the events to be inserted as subheadings of the heading &quot;History&quot; of the customer file (easy)
 - I want the events to be saved as a tree structure:
 ** Year *** Month **** day ***** Event 1 ***** Event 2.... 
 I am trying to modify his code, but I always have errors
 - I have replaced plain with entry in order to get the content as a heading
 - I have replaced file+head+olp in the template definition by file+olp+datetree
  (org-roam-capture- :node (org-roam-node-read nil (my/org-roam-filter-by-tag &quot;customer&quot;)) :templates &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;project&quot; entry &quot;* %%?/n%i\n%a&quot; :if-new (file+olp+datetree &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n#+category: ${title}\n#+filetags: project&quot; (&quot;History&quot;)))))) 
 But still I get the error save-excursion: Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, nil&quot;
 What do I get wrong??

                              <span>I&#x27;m finding that defining outline-regexp does not do for me in python-mode what it does for me in other language modes. Someone else on Stack Exchange ran into the same problem, and a suggested answer to their question makes it clear that python-mode preconfigures some definitions for outline-minor-mode. But what those preconfigurations are, and more importantly how to use them, is not documented anywhere I can find.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs. Using doom-emacs I have the following lines in my config.el:
 (after! org (custom-set-faces! &#x27;(org-document-title :height 2.0) &#x27;(org-level-1 :inherit outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.75) &#x27;(org-level-2 :inherit outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.5) &#x27;(org-level-3 :inherit outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.25) &#x27;(org-level-4 :inherit outline-4 :weight bold :height 1.1) &#x27;(org-level-5 :inherit outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06) &#x27;(org-level-6 :inherit outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03) &#x27;(org-level-7 :inherit outline-7 :weight semi-bold) &#x27;(org-level-8 :inherit outline-8 :weight semi-bold) ;; Ensure that anything that should be fixed-pitch in org buffers appears that ;; way &#x27;(org-block nil :foreground nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch) &#x27;(org-code nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-table nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-verbatim nil :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-special-keyword nil :inherit &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-meta-line nil :inherit &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) &#x27;(org-checkbox nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch))) 
 This works fine, but gives me a strange-looking columnview (because many todo-items do have different fontsizes now).
 How can I ensure, that - when using columnview - a monospace font with a fixed fontsize is used?

 If that is not possible the only way I see round it will be to replace better off replacing the whole line with a string splicing the replacements where the groups are.

                              <span>When local repository moved ahead and remote also moved ahead, the remote doesn&#x27;t allow Push. You have to first Pull. But sometimes pull doesn&#x27;t work straight forward, you have to specify the merge strategy. This happens when &#x60;--ff-only&#x60; doesn&#x27;t work for some reason.
 In such a scenario, I normally use &#x60;--no-rebase&#x60; option. It creates a new commit with the merge. I can use &#x60;--rebase&#x60; also. But that is my personal preference. I want to keep the history of changes as is.
 I couldn&#x27;t find &#x60;--no-rebase&#x60; option in the Magit interface. Any idea, how to do that using Magit?
 ChatGPT suggests that instead of direct Pull i.e. &#x60;F u&#x60;, I should first fetch and then merge i.e. &#x60;f u&#x60; followed by merging aka &#x60;m m&#x60;. Although, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. But just wanted to ask, if there is a direct way to achieve &#x60;--no-rebase&#x60; in Pull.

 I&#x27;m looking at UMPCs and various 7-inch mini laptops you see on eBay.

                              <span>I want to build a full stack application with Scala. Just for fun and for learning. 
 The ideia is that it should work similarly as an ecommerce application.
 Do I have to do it with ScalaJS? 
 Should I use Akka (Pekko) or ZIO? 
 I plan to start it very simple and with time improve it. I would really appreciate suggestions and recommendations from people that already did something similar, and what you would have done differently from what you did.
 Thanks in advance guys.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I need an advice on picking up a library for simple asynchronous inter-process communication, preferably message queues or RPC. I have an application that launches background processes and would like to have bi-directional communication between them. All the processes are children of the same process, are running on the same machine, so ideally it could be something shared memory-based, for speed and simplicity. I am aware of the Cloud Haskell project but it seems to be abandoned and it feels a bit too heavyweight for the task. The bindings for unix IPC I could find on hackage look a bit half-baked or very low-level or don&#x27;t have queue functionality. ZeroMQ? Never used it, so no opinion. DBus seems to need the DBus daemon running. Any other options? 
 Thanks in advance.

 So I am trying to install Haskell on Windows 10.
 I run this script in Powershell:
 Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol &#x3D; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; try { Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/sh/bootstrap-haskell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing))) -ArgumentList $true } catch { Write-Error $_ }
 These are the steps I did after:
 1. I put the Haskell install inside C:\Users\F\Haskell 2. Confiremd the Cabal directory to be in C:\Users\F\Haskell\cabal 3. Said not to haskell-language-server (HLS) 4. Said no to stack 5. Installed the default MSy…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m maintaining a package and enjoy developing it with Haskell. But I&#x27;m thinking of expanding target audience via expose the package to other languages. 
 The primitive idea is: build package to a shared library ( .so/.dll ) , and expose it to C world and JVM world via JNI .
 I&#x27;ve lookup at https://wiki.haskell.org/FFI_complete_examples
 But seems that it require to &#x60;rewrite&#x60; all GADT fields from Haskell primitive to C primitive. ie.
 Int -&gt; CInt 
 So, this method requires to rewrite all GADT structures. Is there a way to expose functions and GADT to C automatically without changing current code ?
 Thanks for your help

                              <span>Hi all,
 I know that iCloud Drive is not the best product for this purpose, but I have to use it for other reasons.
 So, I learned online that the path to iCloud Drive is ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs However, I cannot find my beorg folder using this path either in terminal or in emacs. Actually, it is not just for beorg. About 1/3 of the folders in my iCloud which I can access from Finder do not show up if I use the path in terminal or emacs.
 Any solutions? Thank you!

                              <span>With every start of Emacs 29, native comp starts compiling the files cl-loaddefs.el and tramp-loaddefs.el, but I can&#x27;t find corresponding *.eln files in (all) native-lisp directories. (Native compiling other (internal &amp; extra) packages works, it is not an issue with access rights.)
 What is the use of that behavior?
 I could disable that native jit compiling, by putting following line in my early-init.el
 (setq native-comp-jit-compilation-deny-list &#x27;(&quot;.*-loaddefs.el.gz&quot;)) 
 Would that break some facilities within Emacs, if I do so?

                              <span>Hi,
 I was using my search engine to look for available Emacs integrations for the open (and local) https://gpt4all.io/ when I realized that I could not find a single one.
 Is there somebody who&#x27;s using GPT4All with Emacs already and did not publish his/her integration?

                              <span>When editing common lisp with slime and emacs, I&#x27;d like a speedbar listing, alternately, top level definitions in the file I&#x27;m editing, and top level definitions in the package I&#x27;m looking at (which may be a superset of definitions in the file). Preferably sorted by type of definition (function, macro, constant, etc) and/or alphabetically.
 Is there some emacs tooling for this? I haven&#x27;t found it.

                              <span>I hope every completion done inside minibuffer is repeatable by vertico-repeat, including commands invoked by M-x. Vertico, however, didn&#x27;t include execute-extended-command as a repeatable session by default. You can be seen it by examining vertico-repeat-filter variable. So I have to customize it like this in Doom Emacs:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp
 (after! vertico-repeat (setq vertico-repeat-filter (remove &#x27;execute-extended-command vertico-repeat-filter))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The question is execute-extended-command seems to be a reasonable default completing session, why does vertico excludes it?

 If I were cool, and a senior developer with tons of experience, I would write blog post and would share my in-detail opinion. But I&#x27;m just gonna leave it at that, claim that I coined the term, and leave all the actual discussion to all of you who know more of what you are talking about.
 P.S.: Or maybe Scalanization? I&#x27;m open to suggestions :D\ P.P.S: I think I like &quot;Scalification&quot; best. Pioneered by IBM.

I&#x27;ve tried GHC-9.4.7 (installed by GHCup by default) and also versions 9.8.1, 9.6.3, and 9.7.2. I&#x27;ve tried cabal versions 3.6.2 and 3.10.1.0. I&#x27;ve combined these in every possible way. I managed to get haskell-language-server installed without headaches, but every time I try to install hoogle, I get errors. The below error is the most common.
 Please can anyone help me out? I&#x27;m desperate to learn Haskell, but I&#x27;ve been struggling for almost 3 full days just to get the tools built with no success.

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I have made a blog using org-publish, HTML and CSS nothing else and although it&#x27;s still a work in progress; today I feel comfortable enough to share it with you, the community.
 https://0xblockz.xyz
 I am a rust developer with a passion for cryptography, security and backend development. My first post is one about just that. 
 Since I&#x27;m not using a static site generator every time I create a new post I have to update the html of my homepage to include a link to that post but later on I&#x27;d like to add orgs sitemap functionality to handle that for me. If anyone has experience with elisp maybe you could help me write the function to do so.

                              <span>Hey, folks.
 I&#x27;ve been digging around to see if there&#x27;s a package for this but the closest I&#x27;ve found is expand-region and that&#x27;s not quite it...
 Take the indent level and block at the line where the point currently sits and set the mark region to the end of the current block + indent level. I hope that explanation is clear.
 This seems very much in the wheelhouse of Emacs and I&#x27;m guessing it exists -- maybe even in core as opposed to a package -- and I&#x27;m just not looking in the right place.
 thx

                              <span>I tried gnuplot and amazed by its performance. It allows you to directly plot mathematical formulas into graphs with just one single line of math equation.
 #+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :file images/trigon01.png plot [-10:10] sin(x),atan(x),cos(atan(x)) #+END_SRC

 when set arguments, it might requires one more line:
 #+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :file images/sd01.png g(x) &#x3D; exp(-0.5*(x/s)**2)/s plot s&#x3D;1 g(x), s&#x3D;2 g(x), s&#x3D;3 g(x) #+END_SRC

 I feel frustrated, how I wish could acquainted with such a tool a decade ago while grappling with the challenges of visualizing mathematical formulas.

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering switching from Gmail to Fastmail, not necessarily due to privacy concerns but because I&#x27;m bothered by the fact that I need extra hacks and additional settings on both the Gmail and Emacs side to use their service properly with mbsync and mu4e. Also, I have the impression that Google will complicate access to IMAP in the future. They&#x27;re already starting with things like passkey. I might be talking nonsense, but that&#x27;s how I see things. Not long ago, they started detecting ad blockers in the browser while browsing YouTube, so as a company, they can change whatever they want overnight.
 I want to emphasize that I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spare, and I&#x27;m taking this step more for my peace of mind, to make sure I won&#x27;t have any issues in the future. However, I would still like to ask for your advice, are you satisfied with Fastmail, have you had any problems with their service while using Mu4e and Emacs?
 I&#x27;ve noticed that they also support a feature called &#x27;masked mail&#x27; and an option to add additional emails. If, for example, I want to display an email address on my CV that isn&#x27;t my primary address and I&#x27;d like to deactivate it at some point, would it be better to use the option to add a new address or the &quot;masked mail&quot; option instead? Also, this separate mail or masked mail need a separate Mu4e context?
 I would be grateful for any suggestions. Thank you.

                              <span>What is your workflow of maintaining logs of literate scripts? I converted most of my scripts to org-mode and tangle them out to scripts for running them. I want to be able to run them within org-babel itself. I use mostly python and bash. I have two laptops one personal and one for work and a desktop. Mostly I want my laptop and desktop in sync so that I can work in either of them depending upon the need. When I want to install or update any of the tools I use in one system I want that to be replicated in the other, not automatically.
 I also need to version the literate scripts, in the sense with history visible in the org file itself. I want the org file to capture my thought flow and the evolution of the code so that I can understand it later by just looking through the file not by meddling with git.
 Does any have similar need and a workflow I can copy?

 Obviously one can solve the questions with Scala 2... But it&#x27;s been years. And the practice helps us juniors a lot.
 I&#x27;ve been building my own repo copy pasting the problems + copying them back and translating to Scala 2, and having fun building a framework to test and run all the problems as I solve them, because it&#x27;s fun, but I really just wanna see how I&#x27;m doing compared to the community, and then try to do better.

 Am I missing something?
 Kudos to Adam Warski and Softwaremill for creating such a great tool!

                              <span>Hi !
 I see that there are still frequent commits to the repo, but no release since May 2023. Releases were quite regular and frequent before that.
 Also, the docs seem inconsistent, switching versions from a page to another.
 I ask because I am considering a little side projet with zio, zio-http, zio-quill,... But I am wondering if the choice will stand the test of time. I am coming from Akka/pekko and I am doing this project also to learn zio and see if it is worth it.
 Thanks in advance ! ;)

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!, 
 As everyone on this community, I&#x27;m an Emacs power user and have several niceties configured, gnus for Email, Doom Emacs, and I heavily use org mode, I recently used it for a &#x27;Incident Playbook&#x27; which was basically making an incident and responding to it following certain steps, more of a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) work. 
 So, I made a server in Ansible, made a test malware that will be ran in this server (delete a log file idk), and proceeded to do everything directly in org-mode, running every command via tramp to the server, getting any info from the disk and getting a dd and such. Finally I made a whole document with full details on the server in that point in time, which was pretty interesting as I could have this as a template for future incidents and have certain commands saved for this.
 And I got the idea, wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting to have org mode files like these but for testing specific vulnerabilities?, even using a tool like NixOS or Guix to make commands that will get the old version x.x.x of nginx and I could test a vulnerability there, so it is also reproducible and everyone can use the org file and test this vulnerability?, basically more of a study and proof of concept rather than something more &#x27;heavy&#x27; as in business related.
 ​
 Does anyone have a similar use case?, I would love to hear for them as I want to go into the DFIR route.
 ​
 TLDR. Not specific to an emacs programming or library question, but much more of a broader question about a cybersecurity workflow.

                              <span>Hi.
 Still learning Emacs but happy with it so far. One thing i&#x27;m trying to find out is this. I&#x27;m OK with Emacs creating recovery files from which i can, well, recover my work after emacs is closed. However, if I save my files, I have no need for these #filename# or filename~ files that populate my folders. Is there a way to make emacs keep creating these recovery files, but deleting them if I *save* my actual files?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I use orgmode links extensively. In particular, I have hundreds (our thousands) of links to emails (in notmuch). I would very much like to add a tag to any email that is being referenced from org.
 So, what I need to do first is be able to find all matches of a regular expression in all my org files. Non-interactively.
 I have been playing around with xref-matches-in-directory but that would not cover when multiple emails are mentioned in the same line...
 I have been looking and looking but everything I find missed the non-interactive part. 
 So: What is the function to &quot;search for this REGEX in FILES in DIR and return the first capture group&quot;? (the regex has a capture group for the msgid)
 The regex:  (rx-to-string (rx &quot;notmuch:id:&quot; (group (1+ (not &quot;]&quot;)))))

                              <span>I want to convert the timestamps in a .zsh_history file to their readable equivalents.
 Does query-replace-regex or some other function provide the ability to replace the match with the value of a function like something like (format-time-string (match 1))?
 : 1568128379:0;cp -a ~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh ~/.zshrc : 1568128381:0;exit 
 I have accomplished the first part using the regex match [0-9]\{10\}

                              <span>hi everyone, I am working in IT support, and occur (and even more multi-occur-in-matching-buffer) ist my tool of choice.
 But I would like it to do more (because why not?) I would like to be able to ignore matches, if terms (let&#x27;s name them excludees) are found in the next 5 lines from the search string match or within a number of lines defined by a variable.
 It would allow to save excludees as a list, and ignore certain matches when for instance the &quot;ERROR&quot; relates to a known bug, and we do not want to see it in occur searches any longer.
 Ideally, this could be triggered by a keymap in occur-mode-map, (toggle-ignore-excludees), so that it is up to the user to activate it or not.
 is there already a similar function that does it? How would you proceed to achieve this?
 thanks for your feedback

                              <span>hello, when executing M-x in emacs 29.1 vanilla, looking for ~apropos~ related commands, I see that this error message is shown instead of the usual description in the minibuffer.
 I assume this error only happens with emacs native functions, not with the most of the commands coming from other packages.
 How can I fix this? thanks for your help.

 Given that eglot has been part of the core emacs, I believe this is a long lasting wish for a lot of emacsers that has finally been fulfilled. (a stand alone DAP implementation that does not rely on LSP-mode)

                              <span>We are hiring! My team (Plutus Core at IOG) is looking for up to two compiler engineers. Plutus Core is a smart contract language for the Cardano blockchain.
 The main responsibility of the role is to work with a team of experienced engineers and researchers in designing and implementing missing features in Cardano smart contract languages, compilers and runtime systems, and writing documentation for users of the languages.
 We love statically typed functional languages, and we are committed to building a friendly, welcoming, and diverse community of Cardano smart contract developers.

Job posting: https://apply.workable.com/io-global/j/3F1AAE5F43/. Note that the Location section, which currently says &quot;US only&quot;, is inaccurate, and I&#x27;m working to get it updated. We are certainly also hiring from Europe (in fact that would be preferred as most of the current team members reside in Europe, and most of the meetings occur in afternoons of European time), and we also have some flexibility to hire from other parts of the world.
 Codebase: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus. The main components include four languages (Plutus Tx, Plutus IR, Typed Plutus Core, Untyped Plutus Core), compilers from one to the next, the Untyped Plutus Core interpreter, and Agda formalization.
 Doc: https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
 Plutus Core spec: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/doc/plutus-core-spec

 The thing is, after quite a bit of web searching, I only managed to get git, gitman, Python, Common Lisp, and SICP. 
 Is there any repository/FTP/storage that has a treasure trove of info manuals ready to add to Emacs?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Ever since DistroTube finished his Configuring Emacs series a couple of months ago, I moved from using (the somewhat monolithic and impenetrable in my opinion) Doom Emacs every now and then, to seriously using Emacs with his config about a month ago, and I&#x27;ve fallen in love. So much so that I clearly wanted to start using Emacs as my window manager.
 I really like having a statusbar, so since I had been using dwm (also, if you want dwm-like window management, Edwina is the package for you), I figured it was finally time to set Polybar up. I did, but as many people experienced, Polybar had the issue of workspaces being off by one with the standard EMWH module. I looked around, and wasn&#x27;t able to find the solution anywhere else, so I&#x27;ll post my solution.

  and it seems to work well, but whenever i open an individual java file to test it, i get a prompt that this file is not a project file, and gives me options  test.java is not part of any project.
 i &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project root /home/maksatr/Documents/ I &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project by selecting root directory interactively . &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Import project at current directory /home/maksatr/Documents/ d &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do not ask again for the current project by adding /home/maksatr/Documents/ to lsp-session-folders-blocklist D &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do not ask again for the current project by selecting ignore path interactively n &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Do nothing: ask again when opening other files from the current project
 Select action: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; is there a way to set it up so that it works with just a java file as well, instead of working only with large projects? I tried eglot, and it seems to work well as a linter, but for some reason it does not have autocomplete.

                              <span>I have been experimenting with PlantUML in Org Babel recently, and it has greatly enhanced my ability to visualize concepts mentally. During post-meal walks, I often engage in mental planning exercises, such as sketching Gantt charts. However, my deficient drawing abilities consistently impede my progress, particularly when it comes to mentally manipulating lines, arrows, and objects. Since discovering PlantUML, the visualization skills have steadily improved, thanks to its intuitive text-to-graph syntax.
 When reading &quot;Marcovaldo: Or, The Seasons in the City&quot; before bedtime for sleep aid, I spend a significant amount of time immersed in its pleasing pages, sometimes without a clear sense of progress. In such instances, I draw a Gantt chart to gain a visual representation of the slow progr…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m an Emacs newbie (using Doom Emacs with GNU Emacs 29.1). I came from vim, and battling with undo there was crazy enough, but I won using this:
 inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap  u inoremap , ,u inoremap . .u inoremap ( (u inoremap [ [u inoremap &#x3D; &#x3D;u inoremap \&quot; \&quot;u inoremap  u inoremap  u 
 Also, I had autogroup that breaks undo every 4 seconds.
 Basically, this configuration breaks undo on almost every possible type command, every Spacebar, Enter, comma, bracket, moving up, down, everything. This is because I hate when undo deletes the whole screen of text.
 How do I replicate this in Emacs? I read this, but it doesn&#x27;t say what is considered a &quot;recent change&quot;.

                              <span>I had a very great setup using app-specific password till now. But now want to move to oauth2 because app-specific passwords will not work any more. So I changed my settings as follows,
 ;; older setting ;; ... (nnimap &quot;gmail&quot; (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;) (nnimap-inbox &quot;INBOX&quot;) (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl)) ;; ... 
 I looked for a solution, or rather asked ChatGPT about the oauth2.el thing. And it suggested the following,
 ;; new settings ;; ... (nnimap &quot;gml&quot; (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;) (nnimap-inbox &quot;INBOX&quot;) (nnimap-expunge immediately) (nnimap-stream ssl) (nnimap-authenticator oauth2) (nnimap-oauth2-client-id &quot;client-id&quot;) (nnimap-oauth2-client-secret &quot;client-secret&quot;) (nnimap-oauth2-credentials &quot;~/.emacs.d/.gmail.oauth2-token&quot;)) ;; ... 
 I created a new project in Google Cloud Console, enabled Gmail API and generated client-id and client-secret for the above. But this doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. When I launch Gnus (M-x gnus), it is stuck at &quot;Openning connection to imap.gmail.com via tls...&quot;. Default browser is not launched for the oauth2 workflow.
 I have tested the following code. It launches the default browser and works just fine,
 (require &#x27;oauth2) (defvar my-oauth2-token (oauth2-auth-and-store &quot;https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth&quot; &quot;https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token&quot; &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email&quot; &quot;client-id&quot; &quot;client-secret&quot;)) 
 Has anyone here done this kind of configuration - gnus+gmail+oauth2?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Rene&#x27;s Sublimeless Zettelkasten for a few years, building up a note archive that uses datetime ID links. I think The Archive follows the same convention.
For example, if I create a note called &quot;Test note&quot; now, the text file will have the name 202310191918 Test note.md, and the link inside the software will look like this: [[202310191918]] Test note.
It would be interesting to try an alternative app/software at some point. I&#x27;ve looked around quite a bit, and I&#x27;m surprised about how few there are who supports this link ID syntax. Most software like Obsidian, Roam, and the like, uses the &quot;[[full title inside the brackets]]&quot; style, making them unable to parse my note link syntax. Some allows for choosing slightly different ID types, but usually never this specific one which I thought was one of the simpler ones.
For example, clicking the &quot;test note&quot; link in Obsidian would just result in the software creating a blank note called 202310191918.md. The only software I&#x27;m aware of can parses the datetime link ID type, are these two:
1Writer for iOS mobile phone
The Archive for MacOS
I haven&#x27;t found anything that supports the datetime link ID for neither Android nor Windows. Are any of you aware of any software I&#x27;ve missed that can be used? All platforms are interesting, from iOS/Android to Windows/Linux/Mac. I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s a possibility to edit all of my notes using a Python script or similar to make them compatible, but that would break compatibility with the software I use today. Happy for any tips. Cheers</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;ll be joining a company in 10 days that primarily uses Haskell. I want to be better prepared when I join. 
 What&#x27;s the best way to go about it? I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll do the following in parallel:
 SICP Haskell for Imperative Programmers (YouTube)
 My background: 1.5 YOE Previous experience in Java, Python and Javascript. Haven&#x27;t written pure functional code with any of them.
 Thanks everyone!

                              <span>I just got into Haskell, I&#x27;ve been going through the book &quot;Learn you a Haskell&quot; from the website. right now I am in the Higher Order functions chapter.
 The author talked about implementing a custom map function. I thought to implement it with the little knowledge I had and then compare it with author. I used the list comprehension and the author used the recursion. Same as the standard library 
 map1:me map2:author
 Why is recursion chosen above list comprehension? is it more performant ?

Before I go deleting parts of my config to identify the problem, does anyone know what setting might cause this? I definitely haven’t assigned M to a key chord...
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been using org-mode for a while. I use it mostly for academic-writing, but I plan to explore more possibilities. 
 If I posted this a year ago, probably I would say that I wanted some people&#x27;s settings and just borrowed them. But the more I use org-mode (and Emacs), the more I appreciate the space for personalized settings. So, I decide to start building up my own settings as a rookie.
 Here is my question. I feel that I understand some basics of org-mode, but I am not familiar with &quot;how powerful&quot; it is--with all the great things I can do in org-mode. So, I am looking for a comprehensive introduction or settings of org-mode. It does not have to be for beginners, but I would like to see how a powerful org-mode environment looks like, probably with many useful packages.
 Suggestions? Thank you.

Convenience in Haskell: Ergonomics of Cabal by Vance Palacio
Should we be trying to create some type of wrapper around hpack/cabal that focuses on user experience, avoiding the work of creating a cabal exact-printer, not burdening cabal maintainers with thinking about perfect UX, and leaving cabal alone to be a good packaging tool/power user tool?

                              <span>At Tweag we have been cooking up a JSON Schema to Nickel contract converter, that we’re excited to announce!

Background
Nickel is a configuration language being developed at Tweag. You can get some deep dives into its design from previous blog posts. I’ll summarize it here as JSON, plus functions, plus types and contracts. One of its main use-cases is generating JSON configurations for other programs (Terraform, GitHub actions, etc). Functions allow you to generate large configurations without repeating information; types and contracts help detect problems early when the configuration is malformed and determine where the problem is.
In the JSON world, the role of contracts is served by JSON Schemas, which likewise specify the form that some JSON-encoded data should have. It’s very natural…</span>

                              <span>I use pdf-tools for reading and recently started using bookmark+ and dired+ for navigating. Unfortunately these two great packages seems to conflict. 
 One of the issues I noticed was that the bookmark+ command for bookmarking a pdf location in a pdf-tools buffer didn&#x27;t work; it gave an empty buffer warning. Turns out bookmark+ creator Drew Adams had already suggested a workaround which I discovered here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/72786/bookmark-plus-and-pdf-tools-pdf-view-error
 So that solved or at least patched that issue. But then I noticed that with dired+ installed and any fairly large pdf opened in pdf-tools, emacs will freeze if you attempt to do dired-jump or helm-find-files. Dired-jump without dired+ is not affected by the size of the pdf at all and just opens the underlying directory immediately. But with dired+ anything above about 1mb or so hangs it for quite a while, anything around 10mb or more just freezes it for minutes on end to the point that unless you want to go make yourself lunch and coffee, you will have to force kill emacs to keep working.
 As a noob, non-techie, non-developer, I just wanted to ask, what is the right way of asking about possibly getting this issue fixed, because I love these two packages and would love to have both in working order, but obviously don&#x27;t have the coding know how to do it myself. Of course if anybody knows of a fix that&#x27;s already out there for this issue, I&#x27;d love to know about that as well.

                              <span>I have a bunch of one off functions to do frame/window layout. But an issue I run into is that if I do, say  (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 255 80) (some-other-function-that-looks-at-frame-size-to-split-windows)  Half the time the resize hasn&#x27;t finished by the time the split function runs, and so it splits incorrectly. I&#x27;m assuming the resize happens asynchronously, but I don&#x27;t see a hook or event I can make use of to make sure I&#x27;m splitting after the fact. Is there something I&#x27;m missing? Sleeping doesn&#x27;t seem to fix it because that just delays the resize as well.

 Has someone experienced something similar? Is there a way to improve this?

 I found code here dnd images into auxtex. I am using the excellent Zotra package. I modified the dnd to auctex code to allow drag and drop pdf files into bibtex. My attempt below works. It creates a bibtex &quot;file&quot; field and fills it with the link to the file. However, it would be nice if I could add the following functionality: change the path of the uri to the directory citar-library-paths, change the file-name (excl ext) to the bib-key, move the file to the new path and then sets the file field. This will be useful when one has to manually add files to the bibtex database (in case where the Zotero translation server doesn&#x27;t find the file. Any help or pointers to a package that works similarly would be appreciated.
 (defcustom BIBTex-dnd-protocol-alist &#x27;((&quot;^file:///&quot; . BIBTex-dnd-bibtex-file) (&quot;^file://&quot; . BIBTex-dnd-bibtex-file) (&quot;^file:&quot; .

                              <span>I have recently approached the world of Emacs, which I find great... The problem though is that I feel I&#x27;m wasting too much time trying to have it running in order to do the real work (and I&#x27;ve seen, there are several memes about it), so I was wondering what are the must-have extensions to quickly fire something functional (similar to vscode... Don&#x27;t make me get back to that please) for development.
 By the way, I&#x27;ve seen several configurations scattered around the web, and something tells me that I&#x27;ve ended up in another anarchic realm (which is, something I both hate and love), as if that of distros -being the same except for one thing- wasn&#x27;t enough.
 Of interest are: Python, Go, Bash, Clojure, Elixir, yaml (Docker, Terraform, Ansible), json, csv
 I would also appreciate the general must-have extensions, currently I&#x27;m getting lost navigating Doom Emacs and Melpa packages.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 Anyone aware of any package/code snipped that could replicate the paste behavior of vs code? To elaborate what I mean by that. When I copy image in file manager and paste it in a markdown file in vscode it automatically converts it into relative path from the current file. Alternatively is there a way to auto complete in the &#x60;C-c C-i&#x60; mini buffer?

                              <span>Hey guys, took me a while to figure this out since there isn&#x27;t much information about this anywhere so I figured I&#x27;d leave this here for anyone else having the same issue.
 If you&#x27;re a terminal aficionado and you&#x27;re using Kitty, all you have to do is install kkp.el and enable it in your config and all keybindings will work properly.

                              <span>I am not skilled in drawing, but after trying PlantUML, I found that I can create visual representations directly using code. This has greatly aided my spatial imagination. 
 Take, for example, the usecases diagram:
 @startuml :user: -right-&gt; (Right) :user: -up-&gt; (Up) @enduml 
 https://preview.redd.it/1bx7h7sa7vub1.png?width&#x3D;152&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6271256f6855b88a93a62abf63569f1bc542ded5
 With the use of directional terms like &quot;up&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; you can intuitively draw the diagram as shown. it lowers barrier for non-artists - no drawing ability needed and focuses thought process on structural elements and relationships. 
 When immersed in text, our spatial imagination can often become less active. For example, when trying to imagine the hierarchical structure of an article such as org-mode, our mental representation tends to be more like a bullet structure in an editor, rather than a graphical tree structure. 
 PlantUML addresses the challenge of limited spatial imagination by providing an intuitive text-graph syntax. One notable feature is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) functionality.
 Consider the following example:
 @startwbs !theme mono Emamcs ** Texting Editing ** Note taking ** File Manager ** Literature Programming @endwbs 
 https://preview.redd.it/95b2mg6w9vub1.png?width&#x3D;567&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;2e0f00c54e4d411ec731eba7b23a46a665ed78fc
 The WBS feature in PlantUML facilitates the effortless transformation of a vertical structure into a horizontal representation. This allows me to mentally interpret and visualize the PlantUML code, automatically converting the vertical structure into a spatially-oriented horizontal structure in mind. Consequently, it effectively resolves the issue of my limited visual imagination and improving it continually.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like magit-status to open full frame, ie a single window. When I hit q to exit, I&#x27;d like my previous window configuration to be restored.
 What&#x27;s the best way to do this? Setting the follow var causes it to open full frame, but removes all windows except for one upon exit:
  (setq magit-display-buffer-function #&#x27;magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1) 
 I can get to my previous window layout with winner-undo, but I&#x27;d like q to do the right thing in this case.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hello, I usually run the same command with async-shell-command, however I have to navigate back to the last command history to trigger my last run command, is there any way async-shell-command (and shell-command) can autofill with last run command so that I just hit enter without extra steps? (i am using doom emacs, btw)
 ​
 edit:
 answer to my own question, after a few hours of digging into &#x27;advice&#x27;, turns out it very simple, just 2 lines of code:
 (advice-add #&#x27;read-shell-command :filter-args #&#x27;(lambda(args) (list (car args) (car shell-command-history))))

                              <span>The org agenda can warn you about upcoming deadlines and scheduled items. It would be useful to optionally have warnings about other sorts of events. Birthdays are an obvious case but this should also include non-repeating events (e.g. a friend&#x27;s concert). Has anyone achieved this?
 As suggested here, you can use diary-remind for this. But this is an awkard general solution, as it requires these entries to use a different syntax to normal agenda items. I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone&#x27;s got a more integrated approach by now? I imagine this might use something like -7d in the timestamp, or a WARNING_PERIOD property.

I&#x27;m using doom emacs but can&#x27;t seem to find a built-in keybind and I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution in the docs or from googling. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, redditors. Haskell beginner here. So I tried to solve this problem on codewars. And this was the best I could do
 ​
 module CalculatingWithFunctions (plus, minus, times, dividedBy, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine) where plus, minus, times, dividedBy :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int plus &#x3D; (+) minus &#x3D; (-) times &#x3D; (*) dividedBy &#x3D; div zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine :: (a -&gt; Int) zero _ &#x3D; 0 one _ &#x3D; 1 two _ &#x3D; 2 three _ &#x3D; 3 four _ &#x3D; 4 five _ &#x3D; 5 six _ &#x3D; 6 seven _ &#x3D; 7 eight _ &#x3D; 8 nine _ &#x3D; 9 
 When I try the following unit test:
 (one $ plus $ one) &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (2 :: Int) 
 I get the following error message
 test/CalculatingWithFunctionsSpec.hs:9:19: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘a0 -&gt; Int’ • Probable cause: ‘one’ is applied to too few arguments In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘one’ In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘plus $ one’ In the first argument of ‘shouldBe’, namely ‘(one $ plus $ one)’ | 9 | (one $ plus $ one) &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; (2 :: Int) 
 If I understand correctly, &#x60;one&#x60; expects some argument, but obviously nothing is provided. I&#x27;m just lost can&#x27;t figure out what to do next. Please help.

 So I&#x27;ve been working with PostgreSQL and the JVM for very long now, and I&#x27;ve always been frustrated with the experience. The tedious manual writing, the ease with which you can break things, and the difficulty of testing have all been constant irritations.
 Some months back I started working towards my dream integration layer, with focus on type-safety and developer experience. Powered by cutting-edge code generation.
 I am excited to announce the first version of Typo, and invite you to have a look at what it can do. Through introduction and documentation at https://oyvindberg.github.io/typo/docs/ .
 Github repo with issues for future work here https://github.com/oyvindberg/typo . 
 Curious to hear thoughts on the direction this is headed in :)

                              <span>I have a pattern that I wanted help analyzing. It may be nothing but I wanted to give it more eyes. Applying it to the continuation Monad
 type Cont :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type newtype Cont res a where Cont :: ((a -&gt; res) -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont res a 
 produces an equivalent definition using an existential Functor w. It does so by abstracting a -&gt; .. into a functor application w .., then adding an extra argument of type w a.
 type Cont&#x27; :: Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type data Cont&#x27; res a where Cont&#x27; :: Functor w &#x3D;&gt; w a -&gt; (w res -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont&#x27; res a 
 Doesn&#x27;t this look weird? Basically translating from Cont ~~&gt; Cont&#x27; we decide what existential functor we want, and we instantiate w ~ (a -&gt;).
  Cont&#x27; @(a -&gt;) :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; ((a -&gt; res) -&gt; res) -&gt; Cont&#x27; res a 
 This turns the first argument w a into into a -&gt; a a…</span>

 data Holder &#x3D; Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length object where object &#x3D; object holder -- Uh Oh 
 Uh oh! We named both the variable and the field accessor function the same thing. We have two options:
  
Rename the variable
  data Holder &#x3D; Holder {object :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length o where o &#x3D; object holder 
 
Rename the field accessor function
  data Holder &#x3D; Holder {hObject :: Object} holderLength :: Holder -&gt; Int holderLength holder &#x3D; length object where object &#x3D; hObject holder 
 
 I know this is depends a lot on preference. Normally, when using other languages, I start functions with uppercase, and variables with lowercase, but I can&#x27;t do this here.
 What do you prefer?

 Hopefully, if anyone is trying to push Haskell at work, Google&#x27;s presence and support helps.

 Question
 In the context of having bigger hierarchical organizations of your files (around topic, context, purpose, whatever), how do you organize your org files specifically? 
 Background
 What I have now is shown below (edited for privacy and compactness).
 ​
  
I have one Git repository (&quot;academics&quot;) which is organized by projects and employers and topics, with .org files scattered kind of willy-nilly, the same way any other kind of file might be. This organization isn&#x27;t structured around taking advantage of org-mode&#x27;s inter/multi-file features at all.
 Within &quot;academics&quot; I have two directories that are (kind …</span>

 I write walls of text so it becomes chaotic to know which is useful. I write useful notes next to useless notes because these notes share the same context. Example:
 * My first day at PizzaLLC
 ** The manager was my high school classmate! (layer 5 - archive/journal)
 ** I would potentially start my own PizzaLLC (layer 1 - idea)
 *** Hiring good employees is essential (layer 2)
 *** Can call my bank for a loan (layer 1 - todo)
 ** Don&#x27;t touch hot oven (layer 0)
 The layers are effectively a way to prioritize more important information. I want to be able to:
  
Only view certain layers at a time and hide the unimportant layers (e.g. hide layer &lt;&#x3D;4). 
 Sort &quot;ideas&quot;, &quot;journal&quot;, &quot;todos&quot; separately. I suppose the best way to do that would be to use tags?

                              <span>I use dwm in my laptop, but previously used i3wm for a few years. I&#x27;m curious about:
  
How well EXWM performs nowadays?
 Is it resource heavy compared to other tiling window managers?
 Is it still an issue EXWM not being multi-threaded?
  
My daily tasks involves just opening chrome, telegram and/or slack, watching movies and coding of course. Would it be a good fit for my needs?
 I&#x27;d love to know your thoughts if you use or have some previous experience with EXWM. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hey there,
 Maybe I&#x27;m just missing something obvious, but I&#x27;m a little bit confused as to how eat-eshell-mode works. If I, for example, fire up Eshell with Eat installed:
 emacs-lisp (elpaca-test :interactive t :init (elpaca eat (eat-eshell-mode)) (eshell)) 
 Then I try running e.g. top, I&#x27;d expect top to open in an Eat buffer, but it&#x27;s not doing that for me right now: it just opens in plain ol&#x27; dumpy Term mode.
 What am I missing? Is this not what Eshell integration is supposed to do? How do you use Eshell and Eat together?

                              <span>It might be a bit controversial notion. But when I try to look for extensions say for completion framework there are many available and I used ido and then moved to ivy. I knew helm existed and is much more powerful in terms of feature-set, but never used it. 
 I read that emacs can report on keyboard usage (I think from xahlee&#x27;s posts). Can it be repurposed to monitor which extensions are used often in users setup and they can share that report if they wish to public say via melpa like services. I suppose that melpa downloads can be used as a measure of usage.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m currently experiencing a lot of input lag and slowness when working on javascript projects. May I ask what extra configuration I&#x27;m missing in order to fix this issue? I&#x27;m using doom emacs. My configuration looks as follows:
 (use-package! lsp-mode :hook (rustic-mode . lsp) (json-mode . lsp) (sh-mode . lsp) (typescript-mode . lsp) (javascript-mode . lsp) (js2-mode . lsp) (rjsx-mode . lsp) :commands lsp :config (setq lsp-log-io nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-render-all nil) (setq lsp-inlay-hint-enable nil) (setq lsp-lens-enable nil) (setq lsp-signature-render-documentation nil) (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable nil)) (use-package! lsp-ui :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode) :config (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq eldoc-documentation-functions nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-diagnostics nil) (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-peek-always-show nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-render-all nil) (setq lsp-eldoc-enable-hover nil) (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable nil)) 
 As you can see, I have most lsp features disabled to improve performance, but yet I&#x27;m having a bad experience while working on JS files. I&#x27;d kindly appreciate any suggestion.

                              <span>I just read Mickey&#x27;s wonderful article on window management, and has given me the push I need to take control over my emacs windows/frames. I have an idea of what I will configure; maximum of two windows per frame, and if is my portrait frame split horizontally and split vertically for my landscape frame, plus some additional config for Magit. Before I take the plunge, I wanted to quickly reach out to see what other people have done for their configs to get some ideas. Figure might also be good to collect a few different configurations of window configs for people interested.
 Some configs I have found on the way and will update with any suggestions people have:
 *Edit - I will add some more here as I find them/people suggest them
  
Karthink&#x27;s config, good integration with the popper package
 emacs-pure - has some display-buffer-alist settings for magit which are of interest to me, as the built in magit methods for handling new frames isn&#x27;t exactly what I want.
 Sacha&#x27;s config using set-window-configuration and current-window-configuration more than display-buffer-alist. The Ediff settings stick out to me
 burly.el by u/alphapapa - might be an easier way to approach the current-window-configuration/set-window-configuration that Sacha has implemented
 Prot&#x27;s window config - A lot of custom functions to help tailor the window management experience to his liking. 
 eyebrowse - package to make Emacs be like i3. Example config from Karl Voit and the use of eyebrowse-restore to help make the configurations stick around.

 Any recommendations, please feel free to share them.

                              <span>Hello and thank you for reading this. I&#x27;m starting my journey to study Emacs, and I&#x27;m interested in turning Emacs in my IDE (mainly C, C++, JavaScript, Rust, and Python, etc...) and taking notes. Could you please give me your best suggestion on how to accomplish my goals? Thank you once more, and have a wonderful day/night.

                              <span>In elisp, symbols serve as fundamental data structures that are more foundational compared to strings. This distinction often caused confusion for me until my encounter with the read function.
  ~ $ (type-of (read)) symbol 
 The fact that the read function yields symbols instead of strings from user-input was a delightful revelation. This discovery convinces me that the fundamental nature of symbols in elisp when compared to strings.

                              <span>I just tried out eglot today, and I must say that I am very very impressed. However, like all software, the julia language server has a few quirks that need to be worked around. Long story short, I have two folders (not nested or anything):
  
folder1 - A git repository of a large julia project that I cloned. Starting eglot here only works partially. Anything imported from other packages is a missing reference.
 
folder2 - A folder I created with various scripts that I wrote for the project in folder1. It contains a Project.toml detailing the necessary julia environment for those scripts to work. Starting eglot here works flawlessly. Both functions defined in folder1 as well as the other packages folder1 relies upon are referenced correctly.
 
 Is there a way for me to start eglot in folder2 but have it work as if I have started it in folder1? 
 I believe one potential solution might be to tell Project.el that the git repository in folder1 belongs to the project in folder2, but I couldn&#x27;t find a command for doing so.
 Alternatively, can I tell eglot in folder1 to connect to the language server that was started by eglot in folder2?
 edit: Hope the question makes sense, and apologies if not everything is phrased in the correct language. I&#x27;m pretty new to both eglot and project.el. Many thanks in advance for any help or hints!

                              <span>Hey everybody, first time poster here.
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a while now, but just recently starting toying with configs, experiencing new packages, learning some elisp so I can customize my emacs experience and overall making it my own.
 A while back I noticed I needed some sort of dark mode functionality to change the theme to a darker one when there is less sunlight. After searching for some packages, I found none that really suited me.
 So I decided to write my own: https://github.com/pedroangelo/theme-rotation.el
 Check it out and tell me what you guys think. I&#x27;ve also included a sort of related work section in the README that discusses similar packages, and why I didn&#x27;t found them to my taste. 
 PS: I wrote this package for my personal use. But if more people find it useful, I&#x27;d be quite satisfied with myself.
 Also, do you think I should work towards getting it published in MELPA? I don&#x27;t mind the work if it something that potentially many people might enjoy using.

                              <span>While a for-loop is a straightforward construct in other programming languages, the loop macro, despite its power, can present challenges due to its intricacy. I find myself frustrated by its complexity.
 However, its conceptual abstractions are intriguing. Take, for example, the following code snippet:
 (loop for i below 10 sum i) 
 The utilization of the term &quot;below&quot; in this context is particularly striking. Contrastingly, in languages like JavaScript, I typically read &quot;i &lt; 10&quot; as &quot;i less than 10,&quot; pronouncing the two words &quot;less than&quot; in order to read the &quot;&lt;&quot; symbol.
 The act of reading &quot;&lt;&quot; as &quot;less than&quot; momentarily interrupts my cognitive flow between the two words. The loop macro condenses it as a single word, &quot;below,&quot; allowing me to pronounce &quot;i &lt; 10&quot; more succinctly and smoothly, without interruption. Another viable alternative could be &quot;under.&quot;
 Moreover, the expression &#x60;1 &lt; i &lt; 10&#x60; can be read as &quot;from 1 to 10.&quot;
 (loop for i from 1 to 10 sum i) 
 It enhance code readability mentally and streamline cognitive processing.

Long story short, Im stuck at this GIS job, massive computing experience under my belt, but close to 20% experience in GIS. Im playing around with SmallWorld locally and on a cloned repo. But they also have a Development environment on a remote server. Everyone here says theres no way to use your own Emacs version (28) on this one, except Emacs 23. Do you have any comment on this? Talk to me like Im a child. Im not sure if its an SSH setup. A senior told me it isnt (in a very thick accent). He might be bullshitting. (They use a VPN and sometthing called &quot;f5 networks endpoint inspector&quot;)

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a pretty solid workflow now based loosely on GTD with TODO tasks in categories, projects and NEXT tasks, weekly and monthly reviews etc.. I have a good org-super-agenda config that I&#x27;ve been using happily for months.
 The issue I have is that out of the myriad of tasks I have available to work on at any one point, I am not good at just picking one and getting on with it. Almost like flicking through Netflix and never actually deciding what to watch.
 Might be more of a behavioral problem, but I wondered if anyone has a function or utility for picking a task at random from a given org buffer and highlighting it in a new buffer, or similar. Idea being this would force selection from a set of tasks you know you could progress.
 Or has anyone got good suggestions on how to tackle picking a next task on which to spend time? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily bad task definition, and it&#x27;s also not that they should be someday/maybe tasks to which I&#x27;m not firmly committed.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I believe this is a bug, but I want to make sure I&#x27;m not missing something obvious. 
 I know I can kill entire trees by folding them and then calling org-kill-line with point at the beginning of the line where the heading is. I do this all the time (though I have set org-ctrl-k-protect-subtrees to t to avoid accidents). 
 However, if visual-line-mode is on and the heading text continues to a second visual line, this stops working as expected. 
 Take for example the following two trees: 
 * Heading This is some text * This is a heading on the longer side for an example This is some text 
 Now, using emacs -Q, evaluate the following code (I set the frame size as narrow as I did so that the second heading only wraps around to a second visual line): 
 (org-mode) (visual-line-mode) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 30 50) (org-overview) 
 With point on the first heading, call kill-line. The entire subtree will be killed. 
 With point on the second heading, now, call kill-line. Only the first visual line occupied by that heading will be killed. 
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>How does one search in headings only? I use evil if there is an evil-specific way. Thank you.
 Until now I&#x27;ve been searching with \^\*.*foo but if there is a better way I&#x27;d love to know.

                              <span>I have an issue where I cannot authenticate with Haskell, but it works fine from Mongo express or Mongo Compass.
 I have the following docker setup:
 version: &#x27;3&#x27; services: mongo: image: mongo environment: - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE&#x3D;badminton ports: - &quot;27017:27017&quot; mongo-express: image: mongo-express environment: - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER&#x3D;mongo - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT&#x3D;27017 - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ENABLE_ADMIN&#x3D;true - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_DATABASE&#x3D;admin - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_USER} - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_AUTH_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME&#x3D;${MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN} - ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD&#x3D;${MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD} depends_on: - mongo ports: - &quot;8888:8081&quot; ENV: MONGO_ROOT_USER&#x3D;devroot MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD&#x3D;devroot MONGOEXPRESS_LOGIN&#x3D;dev MONGOEXPRESS_PASSWORD&#x3D;dev 
 And then this simple example:
 import Database.MongoDB mongo :: IO () mongo &#x3D; do pipe  show closed is_auth  show is_auth dbs &lt;- access pipe master &quot;badminton&quot; allDatabases print dbs close pipe 
 Which prints:
 &quot;Closed? False&quot; &quot;AUTH: False&quot; ingest-exe.EXE: expected (&quot;databases&quot; :: [[Field]]) in [ ok: 0.0, errmsg: &quot;Command find requires authentication&quot;, code: 13, codeName: &quot;Unauthorized&quot;] CallStack (from HasCallStack): error, called at .\Data\Bson.hs:113:10 in bson-0.4.0.1-5H36pPFgi2uLQl05dXyxb6:Data.Bson 
 I am sorry to just throw this code dump, but I have no idea what I am missing. I have tried &quot;
 setLocaleEncoding utf and ascii&quot;.
 EDIT:
 I just tried with version 3.6 of mongodb, and then it works. So it seems the library is not up to date with latest version of mongodb.

 If anyone is interested in the operating system, here is a paper.
 http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rsc/Resources/context-OS.pdf
 This is the piece of code
 open :: Tree -&gt; CC r (Z r) open tree &#x3D; promptP (\p -&gt; let visit n &#x3D; shiftP p (return . Yet n) in liftM Done (traverse visit tree)) 
 traverse is a procedure, and Tree and Z is a data type, see
 data Tree &#x3D; Leaf Int | Node Tree Tree data Z r &#x3D; Done Tree | Yet Int (Maybe Int -&gt; CC r (Z r))

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am pretty familiar with OOP &amp; imperative languages in general, and so my thought process is perhaps completely wrong, in the context of Haskell, when it comes to solving this :
 How would you go about managing an interface-implementation type of pattern?
 Let me give you a concrete example to illustrate : I have written two Window management abstractions for my application using GLFW &amp; SDL2, which are just defined as &#x27;Window&#x27;
 data Engine &#x3D; Engine { window :: Window } 
 Both of my implementations have the same function signatures and so for the moment I can decide which variant to use in my &#x27;Engine&#x27; / program by which module I end up importing ; obviously given they share the same function names, I can only import &amp; use one at a time.
 What I would like to do is be able to choose at runtime/dynamically or at least through a parameter.
 Now with my meager experience with Haskell &amp; functional programming in general, I can see two ways to achieve this :
  
Using typeclasses, i.e. have a class Window, which defines my &#x27;interface&#x27; 
 Then declare an instance for both my GLFW &amp; SDL2 version
 
 Or an abstract data-type which uses record-syntax to list the functions of that interface. 
 Then create a new value our of this datatype &amp; pipe the respective function implementations.
 
  
I realise the above probably makes more sense in an OOP kind of way, so I would be interested to know how this sort of pattern would typically be achieved the Haskell way?
 Thanks in advance!
