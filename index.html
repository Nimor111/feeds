                    <span>I am new to Zettelkasten-method and work with zetteldeft (currently 5 real zettel in it).
I do not understand the concept of backlinks. What is it and how to use it?
From the meaning of the word I would assume that a &quot;backlink&quot; would create a 1to1 relation by default.
But in &quot;B&quot; is a new and automatic created link (back) to &quot;A&quot;, too.
So what is backlinking about?</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with a new workflow and have not found a way to get from the OmniBar being active, moving the focus to the Note List without mousing. Is this possible with a keyboard shortcut or a menu item? A tab moves the focus past the Note List directly to the editor. Select Previous and Next Note work to move up and down the note list but keep the focus in the OmniBar. My goal is to use ⌘A to select all the notes in the Note List, but this requires the focus to be in the Note List.</span>

                    <span>M-x org-export-display h o works fairly well in exporting by .org file to html. But the bibilography processing is not great: in sentences referencing articles, I see raw bibtex keys, and I also see them in the generated bibliograpy. Like this: 
  
... But this value doesn&#x27;t include diffuse irradiance Sengupta21solarBestPractBkNREL, ... 
 References

However, if I export to pdf first using M-x org-export-display l p, and then run a version of htlatex over the resulting tex file, then I get a nice numbered bibliography (or whatever other format I pick). Since I&#x27;m on Windows using TexLive, I&#x27;m actually using xhlatex instead of htlatex. The command is
 xhlatex my_file.tex 
 What to do I have to change to get org-export-display to use xhlatex? Or, does anyone know a different way to automate the step above?

                    <span>Anyone tried to render stock / flow diagrams on Emacs?
 I was reading Thinking in Systems: A Primer and found this diagram:
 Figure 14. Reinvestment in capital
 With Org + Mermaid, I was able to get a diagram rendered like:

 Mermaid doesn&#x27;t support edge icons or pointing edges to another edge, or rendering a cloud shape node, so I had to tweak the styles a bit. For detail please see here.
 What do you think?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using newsticker for RSS. Suppose there&#x27;s an rss(xml) file full of relative links. The link element is relative as well.
  
/  I need to change this to the url (say https://example.com/) based on the one supplied to newsticker-url-list (https://example.com/rss.xml) on pulling the page. What&#x27;s the best way to do this?

                    <span>Hi, I am relatively new to the emacs world, just started using it a couple of weeks ago. Managed to customize the experience to my liking. But I noticed a strange behaviour with emacs, even the default one, without using my own init/settings file. Some of the code is not highlighted properly. For example in the picture below you can see that some of my function calls are properly colored in blue, while other function calls are not. What is even stranger is when i type a function call (a single call on one line) it is still not coloured, and is black font. The examples below are using the default emacs settings run like that -&gt; &quot;C:\Program Files\Emacs\x86_64\bin\runemacs.exe&quot; -q
 As you can see below, in two different function definitions, function calls in the first one are plain black, in the second one they are properly coloured blue. Even functions that do not exist. The file i am using is a standalone, i.e the includes are not valid for this file, i just copied it on my desktop to test emacs. (I hope its not because that)

                    <span>Hi hi Emacs users in the wild,
 I&#x27;m very happy to announce that I just released version 0.1.2 of weblorg, a Static HTML Generator for Org-Mode, written in Emacs Lisp. For those who haven&#x27;t heard of Weblorg, it is a declarative API that defines routes similar to how lean HTTP application frameworks are structured. Check out the get started docs to learn more!
 You can find the whole story about this new release here, but the gist is:
  
A lot of polishing of theming support, as well as the design of the default theme
 Some improvements for the blogging support, like fixing generating URLs, adding an RSS template to the default theme
 Many new features and bug fixes in templatel (the templating library)
 Lots of bug fixes
  
If that sounded interesting to you, check out more about weblorg and templatel :)
  
website: https://emacs.love/weblorg/
 github: https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg
 templatel: https://github.com/clarete/templatel
  
I&#x27;d love to hear what you think,
 Cheers

                    <span>This is a head scratcher – at least for me. DuckDuckGo skills and Emacs Docs skills are at the close.
 This is the illustration for my question.

How can improve the visibility of those triangles (buttons/widgets(?)) in the dark theme?
 Can I programmatically change the svg there?
 Or is there a best practice to do such things?

                    <span>Emacs noob, working with Doom Emacs. I recently changed my doom-font (main font in Doom) to have :weight &#x27;light, and I&#x27;m mostly happy with the result. The trouble is that I still have the weight of font-lock-keyword-face set to bold, and the difference in weights is pretty jarring. I&#x27;d like to set the weight of font-lock-keyword-face to normal, so that I still have some difference in weight with the surrounds, but not so much.
 I&#x27;ve tried adding (set-face-attribute &#x27;font-lock-keyword-face nil :weight &#x27;normal) to my config, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make any change: describe-face still tells me that the weight of font-lock-keyword-face is bold, and that&#x27;s what I see. Can anyone help me get the weight sorted out?

                    <span>dumb-jump used to work nicely as I remember (although it&#x27;s been a few years now).
 Now it refuses to do anything at all - it says it&#x27;s been replaced by xref. But xref-find-definitions insists on a TAGS file which is not what I want.
 Any idea how this has to be set up (for python)? I&#x27;ve tried the suggested:

                    <span>One of the great pieces of advice I received for setting up Dvorak keys was to swap C-x and C-u keys, and the following snippet does just that.
 ;; Dvorak settings (keyboard-translate ?\C-u ?\C-x) (keyboard-translate ?\C-x ?\C-u) 
 I had hoped that a simple replacement of the the C with M would make that change for Meta, too, since M-x is common and awkward on my keyboard. However, that gave me a type error. So, for understanding&#x27;s sake I want to understand why the error; why wasn&#x27;t it as simple as a find-and-replace? Instead I had to make a change to the key-translation map, which works great but still leaves me in the dark. Can someone explain why keyboard-translate didn&#x27;t work here?

                    <span>I have a 144KB org file with a lot of image links and math notes with a lot of latex fragments.
 When I change the theme color and open the file it takes at least 10 to 20 seconds to regenerate all of it.
 I switch between light and dark background depending on the time of the day so this happens daily.
 Saving to the disc has also become a bit sluggish.
 Is there any way to speed up the process?
 Should I break the org file in smaller bits or avoid latex?

                    <span>The level of indenting changes the meaning of a line in haskell.
 Haskell is a decent programming language, but I don&#x27;t like fine-tuning whitespaces in haskell code. Editor support for haskell auto indentation can be often broken. I don&#x27;t want to manually indent haskell code.
 Perhaps, is there a dialect of haskell that ignores whitespaces?

                    <span>I asked this on the libraries mailing list but thought posting here would bring in potentially more responses. I made a recent change to the behaviour of lookup and find (see here for more details: https://github.com/haskell/containers/pull/800). 
 We would like to make sure this change does not cause regressions to downstream users and so I wanted to ask if any of you knew any projects that make serious use of Intmap with benchmarks available so I could measure changes in performance?
 Cheers!

                    <span>Figured I should post these new ones here, as they _might_ actually be useful for someone else.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/merge is a very fancy way to write functions which merge two items of the same type into something else, potentially failing with a validation error. I had all this code like:
 g x y &#x3D; Ploop  f x y  h x y  k x y 
 and I figured I could write a little Applicative wrapper that would manage all of that repetitive application of x and y for me. The interface is something like:
 data User &#x3D; User { pubKey :: PublicKey , names :: Set Text , emails :: Set Text , legalName :: Maybe Text } mergeUsers :: Merge [Text] User User mergeUsers &#x3D; User  required pubKey .? [&quot;public key&quot;]  combine names  combine emails  optional legalName .? [&quot;legal name&quot;] f …</span>

                    <span>Every now and then I come across a situation in which I need to transform a sequence of elements, say a List, but the transformation isn&#x27;t independent for each element and I would need to keep additional state during the loop to perform the transformations I need.
 Let me try to give a simple example. In C# I could write something like
  private static List transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs(List list) { bool done &#x3D; false; var result &#x3D; new List(); foreach (var elem in list) { if (!done &amp;&amp; elem is SomeType) { result.Add(transformElement(elem)); done &#x3D; true; } else { result.Add(elem); } } return result; } 
 My naieve attempt at achieving this in PureScript currently looks as follows.
  transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs :: List ElemType -&gt; List ElemType transformSomeElementFirstTimeItOccurs elems &#x3D; reverse (loop elems).result where loop :: List ElemType -&gt; { done :: Boolean , result :: List ElemType } loop &#x3D; foldl (\{ result, done } elem -&gt; case elem of SomeValueConstructor t -&gt; { result : SomeValueConstructor (if done then t else transformValue t):result , done : true } _ -&gt; { result : elem:result, done }) { result : Nil, done : false } 
 But it feels like it could use some improvement. Is there an idiomatic way to do this kind of thing?

 ).
Also, I spend a lot of time writing those notes, around half an hour per note, sometimes for two hours a day. I have a lot of spare time for the last month, but it is going to change. How much time do you spend on each note? How much time it takes you to decide to where to put the note in the ZettelKasten?
Last question, I have 13 index notes out 100. That sounds okay?</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to learn evil mode and though I&#x27;m a touch typer I realized that I have my own version of home row. For instance, My left pinkie sits on CapsLock (remapped to Control) and left index sits on &quot;f&quot;. My right index sits on &quot;k&quot; while my right pinkie sits on Enter. That leave most of the middle of the home row open and doesn&#x27;t translate so well to speed when using vi movement keys.
 I attribute this weird home row to a handful of things:
 1) I use Thinkpad keyboards with Trackpoint exclusvely and leaving the middle of the home row open makes it easier to reach the Trackpoint.
 2) Remapping of CapsLock resulted in left hand shifting further left.
 3) Much time at a terminal resulted in right hand shifting all the way to the right so as to hit Enter to execute commands.
 So, basically, I&#x27;m home row + Emacs + UNIX. 
 How about others?

                    <span>What are some good monospace fonts to use in emacs?
 Here are my criteria:
  
Nothing too fancy (no Monofur or Terminus)
 Should have good differentiability between similar characters ((I, l, and 1), (i, j, and l)).
 Should have italic face
 Free (open source and cost)
  
Preferred, but not needed:
  
Ligatures
 Nerd Font Variant
  
​
 Currently, JetBrains Mono and Hasklig are two that meet all my criteria. I have tried Fira Code, but it seems to index ligatures wrong.
 ​
 Edit: I have tried these and feel like they are not for me:
  
Hack
 Fira Code/Mono
 Victor Mono
 Mononoki
 IBM Plex Mono
 Anonymous Pro

                    <span>I was heavily into emacs back in 2013 but gave up once I realized how far behind and sparse the plugins, linting, etc.. were for specific language that I needed to use. This was due to how obscure emacs was compared to Vim or Sublime, etc...
 ​
 Has that changed now though?

                    <span>Hi folks,
 I am playing around with heterogenous lists. I&#x27;d like to be able to get an item from the list. I have written the following functions:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell getFirst :: HList (e : es) -&gt; e getFirst (HCons e _) &#x3D; e
 getSecond :: HList (e : a : es) -&gt; a getSecond &#x3D; getFirst . rest
 getThird :: HList (e : a : b : es) -&gt; b getThird &#x3D; getSecond . rest
 rest :: HList (e : es) -&gt; HList es rest (HCons _ es) &#x3D; es &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now, I&#x27;d like to generalize them using a type class:
 haskell class GetIdx (idx :: Nat) where getIdx :: HList (Els idx) -&gt; El (Els idx) idx 
 I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to write a proper signature for the getIdx method, because a type family must reduce to a concrete type. In other words, I cannot have the following type family:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell
 -- For &quot;Els 0&quot;, I am naively copying the relevant part of the type signature from &quot;getFirst&quot; above. type family Els idx where Els 0 &#x3D; (e : es) Els n &#x3D; e : Els (n - 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is my conclusion that it is impossible to write a getIdx function such that it an be called like getIdx @1 myHList correct? Is my reasoning for why it is impossible to do so also correct?

                    <span>I have been thinking of ways to evolve an implementation (backend) of a type class without affecting user code. It&#x27;s been rolling in my head for a while and I&#x27;m looking for feedback and examples. A good example is the functor hierarchy: all the functor type classes are unified by a general FunctorOf interface but they are defined separately for now. We want to be able to generalize existing type classes without modifying every instance. It should be backwards compatible.
 Functor &#x3D; FunctorOf (-&gt;) (-&gt;) Contravariant &#x3D; FunctorOf () Bifunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf (-&gt;) (-&gt;) (-&gt;) Profunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf () (-&gt;) FFunctor &#x3D; FunctorOf (~&gt;) (-&gt;) Filterable &#x3D; FunctorOf (Kleisli Maybe) (-&gt;) 
 I imagine a feature where we can mark one type class as a backend for another class, but to GHC they are …</span>

                    <span>HI, I am trying since few days org mode and have millions of lines of documents. The idea would be to read ONE document really long in 4 or 5 different columns. I noticed that if I open an emacs instance I do not need too much width, so I can exploit the height of my laptop enlarging vertically the file, but the height is limited to around 25 cms in a laptop. Because org does not wrap the content on default, I can open an instance vertically in 1/5 of the screen width, so 4/5 of the screen are not used at all! There is an option to open a subsection on the right of the first instance, but why not opening different columns and see all the long document or almost, so that in one single screen we may have an outline on 2-3- 4 or even 5 columns on almost all the document. So that we may scroll one column for instance the second and so the all the columns also scroll accordingly, so that we can see for instance almost all the chapters of a huge book , then could open some paragraphs title of chapter 33 and 56, and compare them together, move content in seconds etc. The simple idea is that people say mindmaps give more an helicopter vision of all the document(and in fact mind maps take all the screen), everyone in the org community debates if files should have links or stay in a single file.Why not giving to the users the possibility to open multiple columns with scrolling integration, so that the user can see huge documents with a glance, be more creative, modify things, search occurrences, it would be genial imo, because org supports different colors per level on default, and would be really easy to spot the structure and be more efficient, combine new ideas creatively, never miss the big picture, etc

                    <span>I suck with dependency stuff :( Nothing ever seems to work and I can never seem to understand why. I&#x27;m trying to spago build this tictactoe game. What I&#x27;ve done so far is spago init and added a few dependencies to spago.dhall, which now looks like this
 , dependencies &#x3D; [ &quot;console&quot; , &quot;effect&quot; , &quot;prelude&quot; , &quot;psci-support&quot; , &quot;debug&quot; , &quot;css&quot; , &quot;arrays&quot; , &quot;integers&quot; , &quot;maybe&quot; , &quot;tuples&quot; , &quot;halogen&quot; , &quot;foldable-traversable&quot; ] 
 Running build again I get the following errors: https://pastebin.com/cUutNNn4
 What, why? Debug.Trace comes from package debug and Halogen.HTML.CSS comes from package halogen, both of which I have there.
 What do I need to do please?
 Is there any tool that can take a look at the import statements used in a project and solve the dependencies based on that?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the following debug function for print statements while debugging.
 import Prelude import Effect.Console (log) import Effect.Unsafe (unsafePerformEffect) debug :: forall a. String -&gt; a -&gt; a debug msg &#x3D; snd $ unsafePerformEffect $ log msg snd :: forall a b. a -&gt; b -&gt; b snd _ b &#x3D; b 
 This would then be used as follows
 myFuncBeingDebugged a b c &#x3D; &quot;test: &quot;  show a # debug $ someOtherFunc $ b c bla... 
 Are there ways to improve the debugging experience? (I&#x27;m using VSCode if that matters)

                    <span>More specifically just want to know 
  
are there any libraries/frameworks commonly used in the industry
 do they use the purely FP or a hybrid of OO/FP
  
I know it really depends on the specific company but best guess is okay

                    <span>So, I was watching a popular Spark using Scala tutorial on Udemy and there I came across this syntax for regex matching:
 val theUltimateAnswer: String &#x3D; &quot;To life, the universe, and everything is 42.&quot; val pattern &#x3D; &quot;&quot;&quot;.* ([\d]+).*&quot;&quot;&quot;.r val pattern(answerString) &#x3D; theUltimateAnswer 
 I am beginner in Scala but I have some knowledge of programming with other languages and this syntax does not make sense to me because it should have been the other way round no?
 Like given below:
 val theUltimateAnswer: String &#x3D; &quot;To life, the universe, and everything is 42.&quot; val pattern &#x3D; &quot;&quot;&quot;.* ([\d]+).*&quot;&quot;&quot;.r val answerString &#x3D; pattern(theUltimateAnswer) 
 ​
 Apologies if I have posted a duplicate question, I have searched related topics but I am getting no relevant results which explain this weird syntax.

                    <span>So...
 Back in the past, something around 2013, we had amazing libs like Scalatra, Finatra, Finagle, Finch, Akka and Play(blergh) in scala ecosystem.
 In that time developers, at least me, used to write code around Finatra or Finagle and now it seems like everything is built around Akka.
 Why Akka became the de-facto solution?

                    <span>Currently I put everything I can inside of a use-package statement. This keeps everything tidy, but sometimes I&#x27;d rather have more flexibility in how I organize things.
 I am considering structuring my emacs init in a more programmatic way, like this (from top to bottom):
  
Global constants (e.g. fonts or any other variables I want to quickly access) 
 Functions which group related configurations together (by e.g. version control, programming, UI, etc)
 Followed by a main() type function that runs all of my configuration functions.
  
I feel like this would massively improve the modularity of the setup. Has anyone done something like this? Or I would be open to hearing other solutions as well.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to emacs, I&#x27;m starting to get the hang of it, and I now want to read the elisp manual and take notes with org. It seems really long so I wanted to hear of others experiences reading it.
 I also plan to read Org manual and later the Emacs manual later (would skim it just for completeness&#x27;s sake cause I think elisp is the heart of emacs)
 I&#x27;d love to know which you have read, how long it took, and how good it was or wasn&#x27;t; did u take notes? and how much you still remember
 I&#x27;d also don&#x27;t mind the input of those who haven&#x27;t.
 Thankss

                    <span>This isn&#x27;t org-specifc, but I&#x27;m trying to create a dedicated buffer (like treemacs or org-roam&#x27;s &quot;backlink-buffer&quot;) that I can toggle open/closed to allow me to make notes in my daily journal (every day is a new file). 
 I can successfully create a buffer named *today* which displays today&#x27;s journal file (e.g. 2021-09-17.org). What I&#x27;d like is, instead of the filename being displayed in the bottom of the window, to have the buffer name *today* displayed there (instead of what can be seen here). I&#x27;m sure this is possible, but my time searching for a solution was less than fruitful.
 This what I&#x27;ve tried so far:
 (defun my/whatever () (interactive) (let ((filename (format &quot;%s/%s.org&quot; org-daily-dir (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)))) (progn (find-file filename) (rename-buffer &quot;*today*&quot;) (org-mode) (display-buffer &quot;*today*&quot;))))

                    <span>I have all my org files in designated folders and I want to keep it that way, but I would also like to try out org roam. I understand for org roam, I need a flat folder structure with org filed. It would be fairly easy to build a shell script that automatically symlinks all org files into a folder and which looks for non-linked files periodically. Would using a folder with only symlinked files work as my designated org roam input folder? If not, what could be another solution?

 However, I am not able to find the original file. I cannot find it in the directory where I have installed emacs, nor anywhere on github. Nothing in /usr/share/themes/Emacs as well.
 Where can I find that css file? It would be great if someone can post it here, it will be fine for me to copy and modify it as well.

 Is it worth it to get the v2? cause it seems v1 has more support and tools (e.g org-roam-server)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve &quot;lived&quot; in Emacs for only 2 months and I just discovered eshell.
 My problem is that in all of my other shells I use C-u very frequently. I guess I do things like kill-backward, then type other commands, and then paste the killed text, etc.
 In term/eshell I can use C-c C-u to do this, but I don&#x27;t want to build the unconscious habit of sending a SIGINT when I tab over to Bash.
 Is overriding C-u for esh-mode a reasonable thing to do? Will this come back to bite me when I become more proficient in Emacs?
 EDIT: Well, here&#x27;s what I put in there. I&#x27;m still getting used to the half-dozen ways of keybinding. Both seem to work!
 (add-hook &#x27;eshell-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (eshell/clear-scrollback) (eshell-send-input))))) (add-hook &#x27;eshell-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-u&quot;) &#x27;eshell-kill-input)))

 f&#x27; :: Num a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a 
 f&#x27; x &#x3D; 1.0
 I get that 1.0 will default to a Fractional but if Fractional is a subtype of Num, shouldn&#x27;t it work?
 This is the error I get: Could not deduce (Fractional a) arising from the literal ‘1.0’ from the context: Num a bound by the type signature for: f&#x27; :: forall a. Num a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a at :395:1-21 Possible fix: add (Fractional a) to the context of the type signature for: f&#x27; :: forall a. Num a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a • In the expression: 1.0 In an equation for ‘f&#x27;’: f&#x27; x &#x3D; 1.0

 There are many situations where string literals are used, for example in Hakyll website
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to type-check something like this:
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} import Data.String (IsString(..)) data Shape &#x3D; Triangle | Square | Circle instance IsString Shape where fromString &quot;s&quot; &#x3D; Square fromString &quot;^&quot; &#x3D; Triangle fromString &quot;c&quot; &#x3D; Circle fromString _ &#x3D; undefined myShape :: Shape myShape &#x3D; &quot;^&quot; -- Triangle invalid :: Shape invalid &#x3D; &quot;foobar&quot; 
 Is possible for invalid to not typecheck? I&#x27;m OK with using any language extension

                    <span>When we have a module in Haskell that has submodules, it can be important to define the API that this whole module tree should have toward the rest of the project.
 For example, let&#x27;s say our compiler project has Analyzer module that has Analyzer.Common and Analyzer.Combinators modules in it. When a new developer looks at the codebase and is about to use Analyzer module in some other part of the compiler, the question is: are they supposed to import only Analyzer, or are they allowed to also import Analyzer.Common or maybe Analyzer.Combinators?
 I would say that often we want the rest of the code to import Analyzer module, while the rest we regard as implementation details of that whole module tree.
 On the other hand, sometimes we do want to allow importing specific sub-modules from the m…</span>

                    <span>I ran into this Aeson strangeness at work because we use a pretty old GHC, and it seems to be fixed in GHC 8.8 even though my example uses the same version of Aeson in both notebooks. My colleague thinks it&#x27;s because fail was finally removed from Monad in GHC 8.8 and I think that&#x27;s probably why, which means there is no longer a fail instance for ((-&gt;) r) (which shows up in the error message in the second notebook linked). Can anyone confirm that that is what&#x27;s happening, and if not, what is?

                    <span>Hello. 
 I use org-mode for a couple of years already. And it&#x27;s a great productivity tool.
 The only disappointment for me is its logo. It looks like a bad drawing from a child. 
 I don&#x27;t think it would be hard to find someone willing to design a logo. I know the important part is the tool itself but still, a good logo will bring more people to org-mode (and emacs in general).

                    <span>I&#x27;ve tried this and, as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t fontify anything.
 I&#x27;m mainly looking to fontify ID links which have IDs that don&#x27;t exist.

                    <span>Hey
 So basically I built a service A that operates on some entity (CRUD with sql DB) and I expose kafka messages on every operation over the entity but everything is built on proto
 eg
 proto - rpc createCart (createCartRequest) returns (createCartResponse) { ... }
 scala - def handleCreatReauest (CreatCartRequst) : CreateCartResonse
 Now I need to create a different service that can at least do thing like CartService.createCart(CreatCartRequst(id&#x3D;&quot;myId&quot;)) but ideally whould also have an ability to consume kafka messages as if it knows about the protos thear schema was generated from
 What do I do? Things I read on SBT and protos didn&#x27;t explain this

If you are a coder, I know you have many other things on your busy schedules, but I&#x27;m asking if you&#x27;d take a couple of minutes to look at my coding attempt and offer whatever help you want. Even just pointing me where or what to look for would be a great help.

Announcing Evoke, a GHC plugin for deriving type class instances quickly by Taylor Fausak
I’m excited to announce Evoke, a GHC plugin that automatically derives type class instances without using generics or Template Haskell.
Deferred Derivation by Matt Parsons
Freeing a module from Template Haskell speeds up our build tremendously - not because Template Haskell is slow (it’s very fast) but because compiling at all is slow. The best way to speed something up is to spend 0 time doing it — don’t do it at all!

                    <span>I want a pretty light text editing experience, I&#x27;m not in computer or data science and just need to use Python for some basic data analysis work so a full-fledged IDE is a bit much for me. Emacs&#x27; regular python-mode lacks some features I would regard as essential for my experience, and I&#x27;d rather ask around about it first before giving up and resorting to an IDE.
 Running Fedora 34 and GUI Emacs.
 Here are the features I am looking for in a python IDE:
 - Running code cells individually (Spyder creates a cell whenever you type #%% on a new line).
 - Being able to view image output (e.g. from matplotlib) within Emacs. This is the biggest one for me besides code cells.
 - Running a .py file from within the python-mode buffer, to be shown in another window (currently have to do C-c C-c C-x o to enter any requisite input and I would like to at least auto switch focus when I run C-c C-c if I need to provide input)
 - A variable value tracker like Spyder has (a window or screen where I can see the currently held values of the script&#x27;s variables)
 - View documentation for functions defined within the script on hover (Python documentation itself seems to be supplied by Eldoc though I must admit I don&#x27;t exactly know how to get it sorted), to be clear I mean the documentation you write into the script yourself right after defining a function. This is optional since it&#x27;s so complex.

                    <span>After using dvorak and emacs for 5-6 years, now I am back on qwerty layout. Emacs and dvorak combination is much more ergonomic than qwerty, I am not sure should I use default emacs keybindings or evil mode.
 I am emacs purist thats why this is hard decision for me.

 MD icons not shown on emacs
 I recently installed Doom emacs, and have an issue with displaying Material Design icons. After some reasearch i found out that set-fontset-font command can be used to force a font for a particular set of characters. I added the following to my config
 (set-fontset-font &quot;fontset-default&quot; &#x27;(#xF0000 . #xF182F) &quot;Material Design Icons&quot;) 
 I think the range covers all the recent icons too, but I still can&#x27;t get them to be shown properly.
 When I use &quot;describe-char&quot; to check which font it&#x27;s using I get the output as &quot;display: no font available&quot; 
 Am I doing something wrong or is there some other way to fix this?

                    <span>I have emacs running as a daemon, emacclient will connect and run just fine in windowed mode. Emacs also works in no new window mode using ms terminal. But emacsclient will not open in no new window mode. It appears to just ignore the -nw, -t, or -tty flags and opens a window anyway. No difference between emacsclient and emacsclientw. Any suggestions?

                    <span>There’s Helm, Ivy/Counsel, Selectrum, Ido, etc. 
 How does one find a good list of completion frameworks? 
 Lately I’ve been thinking of trying different ones. I’ve been a Helm user since I started using Emacs (at the time the only choices were Helm, or Ido related packages). 
 I don’t ever take advantage of Helm specific features - I just started selecting multiple buffers a week ago. It makes me think that maybe I should check out other frameworks. 
 I’ve been interested in the Ivy family of packages because counsel-company looks great! I’m also a fan of counsel-Etags (https://github.com/redguardtoo/counsel-etags) especially since you can define your own command to use for tags (like replacing crags with ripper tags). 
 (I’m also a big fan of binchen in general, I love his Emacs usage and philosophy).
 Anyway - what completion framework do you use and why? I’d love to learn more and try each one out.

                    <span>Hi guys, 
 I am writing my own theme and I would like to change the color of all brackets. I can&#x27;t find any option for setting that. I am using custom-theme mode interface for building the theme.
 Is there an option that I can use inside the custom-theme-set-faces form?
 for example like &#x27;(font-lock-string-face ((t (:foreground &quot;#d7d7af&quot;))))
 Thanks!

                    <span>Okay , it used to work falwlessly ...but now throwing an error while invoking... I understand , you will say, &quot;what changes since then?&quot; ...a lot ..not sure which one is bugging this ...but the code and output text are below ...take a peek :
 capture template code:
 .........
 (&quot;b&quot; &quot;Books&quot; entry (file &quot;~/.emacs.d/OrgFiles/books.org&quot;
 &quot;* %(let* ((url (substring-no-properties (current-kill 0)))
 (details (org-books-get-details url)))
 (when details (apply #&#x27;org-books-format 1 details)))&quot;)
 ​
 Now here is the output I am getting once select/press &quot;b&quot; from capture menu ...in the capture buffer it is showing this :
 %![Error: (void-function org-books-get-details)] 
 ​
 Now, here is the actual code in the org-books.el :
 (defun org-books-get-details (url)
 &quot;Fetch book details from given URL.Return a list of three items: title (string), author (string) andan alist of properties to be applied to the org entry. If the url is not supported, throw an error.&quot;
 (let ((output &#x27;no-match)
 (url-host-string (url-host (url-generic-parse-url url))))
 (cl-dolist (pattern-fn-pair org-books-url-pattern-dispatches)
 (when (s-matches? (car pattern-fn-pair) url-host-string)
 (setq output (funcall (cdr pattern-fn-pair) url))
 (cl-return)))
 (if (eq output &#x27;no-match)
 (error (format &quot;Url %s not understood&quot; url))
 output)))
 ​
 What is going wrong...I am not able to figure it out. I am sure , that I haven&#x27;t change the file to something else.
 Shed some light.

The eaf browser seems to be chromium based but it is unable to use chrome extensions. How can I add an ad blocker? Help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                    <span>I moved away from a hand-rolled configuration and switched to Doom not long ago. After several years of basic functionality, I suddenly found myself with multitudes of modules all loading much faster than my previous config. I couldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d waited so long.
 And then it all came crashing down. I found org-spec, which I absolutely want to use professionally. But ob-ditaa... My understanding is that if I set a variable, defcustom should leave that alone. This isnt&#x27; happening. Perhaps then (after! ob-ditaa ...) will override the default and I&#x27;ll be able to export.
 Please, help me set this in Doom so I don&#x27;t have to evaluate it each time.
 I have tried this:
  (after! ob-ditaa ;; I&#x27;ve tried org here as well (setq org-ditaa-jar-path (dt/trim-last-newline (shell-command-to-string &quot;which ditaa&quot;)))) 
 And, actually, ditaa is on my path, so I&#x27;ve done this as well:
  (setq org-ditaa-jar-path &quot;ditaa&quot;) 
 This is in my .doom.d/config.el. And when Emacs starts, that&#x27;s what it is set to, but when I dispatch to export, it&#x27;s set back to the defcustom specified in ob-ditaa.el.
 I did search far and wide for someone with a config that has this. I&#x27;ve found a few, but nothing seems to work.

                    <span>Greetings, Haskell developers
 We at Code&amp;Jobs are building a job board to help both job seekers and recruiters. We like to find if there is any developer willing to share blog posts relevant to Haskell at our platform.
 Some of our devs are also Haskell devs and if you have a job post to share we can help you share as many jobs you want at our platform also.
 You can see our website here and it is totally free currently.
 You can find some Haskell jobs from our website here.
 We don&#x27;t have a Haskell job from a real user yet so would appreciate if you share some and can help you find a candidate also,
 It would be greatly helpful also if our first blog post is by a real Haskell developer instead of sharing that first ourselves.
 Thanks.

                    <span>How many times a day or even hour do you use and rely upon Org Mode? How much easier does it make your life? What would you do if it was no longer actively developed or supported?
 Think about this, and then reflect that this is completely free to use, the product of countless hours of labour. 
 If you are in a position to do so, consider making an ongoing donation to support its development and longevity.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m currently tasked with trying to maintain several Scala Spark scripts. I&#x27;m hoping to use some SAST tools to look for issues to resolve. The GitLab SAST scanners use spot-bugs, which I&#x27;ve found to not catch anything. I tried using Sonarqube, which has caught a few things but missed a bunch of SQL injections.
 For context, code is mostly ETL scripts. Lots of SQL injection risks, not in a good position to add unit tests.
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a reproducible build so that a project can be built from a different computer. I&#x27;m currently using sbt for the project. 
 I&#x27;m using open-source libraries on github for this project. I needed to modify the libraries because they were missing some features I&#x27;ve needed, so I forked it, then published locally using &#x27;sbt publishLocal&#x27;, and pushed my changes to my github.
 How can I have either a makefile or sbt handle this so somebody (would need to have sbt or make installed), recreate the build?

                    <span>It appears that the parser sees em-dashes and double-hyphens immediately following a block quote as part of the quote, while single-hyphens are considered a separate line.
Will that be a lasting convention? I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation on this, but would like to take advantage of the convention if so.</span>

 Hi.
 After drop emacs and change to vim. I love so many features in vim, but feels kind of incomplete after using emacs. So, returned to emacs and try it again.

 Many points its fixed, but lack some:

                    <span>Repost due to getting some details wrong in the original title.
 Also, actually, the command doesn&#x27;t fail: it interprets d 10 as C-u 62-, so d 10 j is read as C-u 62 j, and instead of deleting 10 lines below point, we instead jump 62 lines down. d 20 j is interpreted as C-u 72 j, d 30 j as C-u 82 j, and so on (unless there are multiple 0s in the command; for instance d 100 j is read as C-u 620 j).
 Here&#x27;s the init.el needed to reproduce this issue; just open a buffer and activate evil-org-mode, then do any evil command with a 0 in the digit argument: y 10 j, d 10 k, y 30 l, etc.
 I discovered that this is due to this line in evil-org-mode; commenting it out removes the issue. However, I&#x27;m not sure why that is; what it&#x27;s attempting to do makes sense to me, and it seems to be identical to what evil itself does.
 I&#x27;d use edebug, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s possible since the result of the evil-redirect-digit-argument call is just a wrapper of a lambda that I don&#x27;t know how to step into. Besides, evil-redirect-digit-argument seems to be being used correctly from what I can tell.
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s causing this issue or how to fix it? I&#x27;m super curious.

                    <span>After a month of vacation a new hls release has arrived:
  
Support for ghc 8.10.6 and 8.10.7
 The ormolu formatter plugin works with ghc 9.0.1
 Call hierarchy plugin has been improved thanks to @July541: 
 Add call from type signature
 Add call from a function pattern
 Go to typeclass instance directly
 
 As usual @isovector has been busy improving wingman plugin: 
 New &quot;intro and destruct&quot; code action
 Streaming tactic solutions: when Wingman times outs, it can still pick the best solution it found
 Let-bindings in metattactics: allows you to bind variables in tactic metaprogram
 Several bug fixes
 
 We have new docs thanks to @michaelpj: https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io
 Now you can ask the executable for included plugins with: haskell-language-server --list-plugins
 There are several bug fixes and features you can found in the merged pull requests list
  
https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/releases/tag/1.4.0
 DEPRECATION NOTICE
  
After this release we will drop support for ghc versions 8.6.4, 8.10.3 and 8.10.4 
 The advise is upgrade ghc to the last minor version: 8.6.5 or 8.10.7
 Take a look to this issue for more details

                    <span>I&#x27;m writing a simple game at haskell, and I want to save and load my StdGen to a file along with other ‏‏‎ parts of the game. I can see that to save the StdGen you can just use show to get the 2 ints that make it up, but how do you then go from those 2 ints back to the same StdGen you originally had. A problem I&#x27;m having is that they&#x27;re 32 bit ints whereas mkStdGen only take one standard sized int. Any advice?

                    <span>Hi,
 Has anyone had experience in using a dedicated display (an iPad, a tablet, or a small standalone monitor) to always display the org-agenda view? I would like to constantly have it in view, but I&#x27;m not sure where to start with setting this up. I have a macbook pro and an iPad, but I would prefer not to use a separate app like BeOrg, since I&#x27;m very used to looking at the agenda as I&#x27;ve configured it.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Came across a problem in Codewars.
 Problem description is exactly as mentioned in https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cf3e6d3c6c7fc00269fc475/scala. For brevity, I am not posting the complete question. Gist is to implement *f* such that the following pass compilation.
  assert(f(Some(42)) &#x3D;&#x3D; 47) assert(f(Some(-35)) &#x3D;&#x3D; -30) assert(f(Option.empty[Int]) &#x3D;&#x3D; 5) 
 I tried the solution with method overload as below. Code compiles and works as expected but I am curious if there is any way this would not compile or run.
 //My solution object Main extends App { assert(f(Some(42)) &#x3D;&#x3D; 47) assert(f(Some(-35)) &#x3D;&#x3D; -30) assert(f(Option.empty[Int]) &#x3D;&#x3D; 5) def f(x: Int): Int &#x3D; x + 5 def f(x: Option[Int]): Int &#x3D; x match { case Some(v) &#x3D;&gt; f(v) case _ &#x3D;&gt; f(0) } }

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been writing Scala full-time for 10+ years, the last few in the genomics field. My current job is interesting but the pay is low (comparatively) and there is effectively no possibility for advancement. All this has me looking for other options. 
 Can anyone recommend any recruiters to contact? (I know about Signify.)
 What industries or employers should I target?
 I haven&#x27;t looked for work in a few years. Any advice in general would be very welcome!

                    <span>Something I did broke magit, many of the commands don&#x27;t work anymore, for example C-n, C-p don&#x27;t move me around in the status window (but plan n and p do...) and more importantly I can&#x27;t trigger a rebase from the log. 
 Whenever I try any of the above I get an error: Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void: project-switch-commands. 
 I&#x27;m looking into it but I figured I&#x27;d post a question in case someone just knew the answer, it&#x27;s impeding my ability to work :(

                    <span>Purpose : To take clean notes or create a short summary of a webpage (blog, documentation etc.) opened in Firefox browser. 
 Which you can refer again in future (e.g. for revision if you are preparing for exams).
 The notes would be saved in org format in your computer (or in cloud, maybe) so that the user can customize it and print it as well (or even save in a presentation format).
 
  
​
  
Working : How it works is basically when you are reading a blog post- 
 An org file for that page would be created.
 You will highlight the text and a popup button will appear.
 When you click it, various options appear like 
 send the selected text as heading or paragraph to org file, maybe send image and various other features that a sane reader requires.
 
 Live edit the org file
 
  
​
  
Tools : Things to make this project happen 
 Firefox extension would be created using JavaScript.
 Emacs daemon can be used to view the file live.
 
  
Now I am a little confused right now and need your suggestions on this, to make this happen or not, as I don&#x27;t know the feasibility of this project.
 Thank you

                    <span>I am trying to add the todo state of a heading which is an org-roam node to the org-roam-node-find UI (so I can easily search for each state I have defined from that menu). To my understanding, the cl-defmethod macro which I need to use to do this, needs a variable which holds this value, so I can display it on that UI. However, I cannot find such a variable, besides org-state (which seems to only exist to store the new state of an item, when its todo state is changed, which won&#x27;t suffice I think).
 Have I missed something or does there not exist such a variable. And if not, can anyone think of a different way to add this info to the UI. This would be really useful for me, but I am not the best at elisp, and looking through documentation and variable-lists, I cannot find a solution to this. I know I can search for each state with a custom agenda query using something like org-super-agenda, which I also plan to do, but the ability to search for them inside org-roam-node-find will make it even better for me. 
 Thanks in advance, and please do ask me for it, if I missed any info you deem important for the task!

                    <span>I&#x27;m a college student and I want to use org-agenda as a roster for my classes. I created a Roster.org file and put my class times in there, scheduled with a weekly repeater (+7). I did not add a TODO keyword to them or anything since I don&#x27;t want to mark them as done every time I finish the class. The problem now is that yesterday&#x27;s classes are now appearing as overdue on my agenda. How can I fix this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m confused on how to get a snippet of elisp to work. I&#x27;m trying to do
 (setq org-refile-targets &#x60;(((concat dropbox-dir &quot;/Org/archive.org&quot;) :maxlevel . 1))) 
 I want emacs to execute the concat before the setq essentially, so the value of org-refile-targets becomes
 ((&quot;~/[USER]/Dropbox/Org/archive.org&quot; :maxlevel . 1)) 
 What is actually happening is that emacs is storing org-refile-targets as
 (((concat dropbox-dir &quot;/Org/archive.org&quot;) :maxlevel . 1)) 
 Which causes a type error whenever I run org-refile
 I&#x27;m quite new to elisp, so it&#x27;s definitely me not understanding how this works. What am I doing wrong?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a package that does a significant amount of text manipulation in a buffer. It&#x27;s doing HTML escaping (via the xml package), Markdown paragraph filling (via the markdown package) and regex substitution for hundreds (sometimes thousands) of lines via multiple temp buffers.
 I&#x27;m considering finding/writing an alternative for the 3 procedures above for direct string manipulation, but before I dive into that I was wondering how significant the improvement (if any) I could expect.

                    <span>Say I&#x27;m typing in a plain text document and I want to insert the name of an emacs or python function without changing the file mode.
 Is there a way to get company or autocomplete to look up functions or keywords in elisp matching what I&#x27;ve typed on a word by word basis?
 This way can type something like buffer and if I hit a hotkey to search for elisp functions, elisp functions matching buffer are offered for selection.

                    <span>As I&#x27;ve been writing Emacs lisp, I&#x27;ve obviously come across a good amount of code written in what I&#x27;ll call the cl style, using cl-lib functions and macros (even cl-defun and the like). I&#x27;ve been putting off using these functions in favor of “vanilla” Emacs forms, though recently I&#x27;ve been noticing the power of the cl-lib tooling.
 Now that cl-lib is built-in to Emacs, I&#x27;d love to hear different opionions on whether you use it or not. What are the pluses and minuses of using cl-lib or older parts of Emacs Lisp?

                    <span>Hi all... again,
 Maybe you saw https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/jt5893/looking_for_20_haskell_developers_in_eu/ and thought it’s not current. But it still is! Since the last time we posted this, we have hired 9 Haskell developers (plus three Elm devs, to mention other fp roles). But since 9 &lt; 20, we are still hiring!
 Scrive still needs pragmatic, production-oriented Haskell developers. We do a bit of “deeper Haskell” and maintain a few OSS projects, but primarily we build stuff that serves our customers.
 The product is in the e-signing space and this is usually categorized as &quot;legaltech&quot;. For me it is more &quot;get the world rid of paper&quot; and &quot;help people reach agreements over distance&quot;.
 https://careers.scrive.com/jobs/996814-haskell-developer
 EU residency and work permit is required, as is fluency in English (Norway and Switzerland are fine, UK is not). This part sadly accounts for the majority of rejections we have had to communicate, but we really need these two things.
 We are “remote-first” for developers. I was recruited via this reddit 5 years ago and I am still full remote.
 We need more than 20 people over the next 12-18 months. Don’t be shy :P

                    <span>This is for any noobs like me who have no programming experience and are having trouble setting up neovim lsp with hls. I spent like 5 hours everyday for the past 5 days trying to get this thing to work. It felt like hell but I finally got it work.
 Anyway, for some reason if you open a .hs file with nvim in a stack project, hls will not attach. Instead, try creating a new cabal project, change directory to the &quot;app&quot; folder in it, and open &quot;Main.hs&quot; file with nvim. And for some reason, it&#x27;s got to be the Main.hs file in app; if you don&#x27;t HLS will still attach but theres still an annoying error message.
 I have no idea why this works, but at this point, I&#x27;m just happy that hls even attached. FWIW, I think the problem has to do with stack getting ghc version wrong. This might help, idk: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/1782

                    <span>I&#x27;m doing some recreational writing using org-mod. I like it so far. Great. I think I&#x27;ve gotten best results using pandoc to create a PDF, but the results are beautiful. I could do the same from within emacs I&#x27;m sure.
 I have one file per chapter, which is natural and works for me. I can maybe be dissuaded. I think every file wants a &#x60;#+TITLE:&#x60;, at least because pandoc requires it or complains. If I output &quot;one chapter&quot; (file), everything looks great. The (chapter) title looks just the way I like it.
 If I do the following with pandoc:
 pandoc -s *.org -o my_book.pdf 
 The problem is that the titles of the chapters end up all mashed together at the top of the document. Everything is more or less perfect.
 Should I maybe just not do this and manage this as one big doc, using hideability to deal with the unwieldiness? I could be convinced.

                    <span>I use windmove to move windows. I have the following setup: 
  (use-package windmove :bind ((&quot;C-S-j&quot; . windmove-left) (&quot;C-S-l&quot; . windmove-right) (&quot;C-S-i&quot; . windmove-up) (&quot;C-S-k&quot; . windmove-down))) 
 However, in org buffers, the C-S-i binding gets overwritten. I can not figure out how it is being overwritten. It seems like it is doing org-cycle global as it will cycle all headers in the file. When I do C-h k I get this: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; S-TAB runs the command org-shifttab (found in org-mode-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘org.el’.
 It is bound to , S-TAB, , ,   ,    . &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; The binding C-S-i doesn&#x27;t show up in C-h m or C-h b either. The other windmove bindings do show up in C-h b though. When I&#x27;m in another buffer with a different mode all of my windmove bindings work fine. It seems to just happen with org buffers.
 I&#x27;m really scratching my head as I can&#x27;t find any smoking gun to what&#x27;s actually being called or how it is bound.

                    <span>i am very new to emacs, and i saw all the great things a person can do with it.
 all i want to do is this
 setup three &quot;lists&quot; (sorry i don&#x27;t know what to call them but these are like (backlog-doing-done)
 so basically the item starts in BACKLOG and then it moves to DOING when checked and then it moves to DONE when checked.
 I saw a talk about refile but i didn&#x27;t know how to use it.
 you can just direct me to another thred or article if you think it&#x27;s simple to not be ELI5.
 thanks!

                    <span>Hi fellows emacsers,
 I wrote a little tool in C that allows you to use normal keys as modifiers.
 I found the other programs that were already providing this functionality either too complicated or not working very well.
 So I thought this could be useful to some of you. I use it every day and I can definitively feel the beneficial effect on my pinky.
 (For the curious ones, my keyboard setup is the following: CTRL on thumbs, CAPS is bound to ESCAPE, and both CAPS and ENTER have ALT as their secondary function. ALT is also on pinkies too, just in case. The &quot;super/windows&quot; keys are either on thumbs (next to CTRL) or palms depending on whether i&#x27;m using the laptop keyboard or the external one. 
 For normal remapping I have been using the X config files.)

                    <span>In my home office my dock connects to three screens. In my other office, it just connects to two, and the id of the screen does not match. randr and autoxrandr detect this difference, but exwm is hardcoded with the details and the result is that, until I swap the hardcoding, I cannot use the extra monitor(s) in one of the locations.
 Here is the code that is swapped in exwm.
 ;;; HOME OFFICE ;; (setq exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist &#x27;(1 &quot;DP-1-1&quot; ;; 0 &quot;eDP-1&quot; ;; 2 &quot;DP-1-3&quot;)) ;; (add-hook &#x27;exwm-randr-screen-change-hook ;; (lambda () ;; (start-process-shell-command ;; &quot;xrandr&quot; nil &quot;xrandr --output DP-1-3 --right-of eDP-1 --output DP-1-1 --left-of eDP-1&quot;))) ;;; CAMPUS OFFICE (setq exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist &#x27;(1 &quot;DP-1&quot; 0 &quot;eDP-1&quot;)) (add-hook &#x27;exwm-randr-screen-change-hook (lambda () (start-process-shell-command &quot;xrandr&quot; nil &quot;xrandr --output DP-1 --left-of eDP-1&quot;))) 
 Right now I have to invert the comments and then restart emacs. There must be a better way!

                    <span>I find myself often looking at log files that have a mix of single and multiline log messages. I am not really sure what the right tool for the job might be but I would like a version of occur that can deal with that in some way. Any suggestions?

                    <span>So I&#x27;ve been trying to set up org habits, but for some reason, I keep getting the following error:
 Symbol&#x27;s defintion is void: org-clocking-buffer 
 and trace:
 ​
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function org-clocking-buffer) org-clocking-buffer() org-clock-kill-emacs-query() run-hook-with-args-until-failure(org-clock-kill-emacs-query) save-buffers-kill-emacs(nil) save-buffers-kill-terminal(nil) funcall-interactively(save-buffers-kill-terminal nil) call-interactively(save-buffers-kill-terminal nil nil) command-execute(save-buffers-kill-terminal) 
 I&#x27;m guessing its some issue with the version, because I saw here that there could be some mixed installation error? 
 I&#x27;m using straight.el to manage my packages, and at first I just had the (use-package org) command, then I tried adding the org source , but nothing helped. 
 So is there anyway to fix this? What even is the error

                    <span>I have been trying to set up web-mode in a way that makes all html tags be folded by default when opening an html document with this mode enabled, or if there&#x27;s a way to fold all of them on demand so I can attach that as a hook to web-mode
 Been looking to see if there&#x27;s a relevant web-mode-function or some variable I can enable browsing them with C-h v (I found &quot;web-mode-enable-auto-closing&quot; and battled with it like one hour wondering why it didn&#x27;t fold everything, only to find out it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with folding, but actually autocompletes matching tags :p it was cool to discover that one though)
 The way it works right now, all tags show unfolded by default, and I set it up to close/open them by pressing tab, but even if I close all of them manually, they just come back unfolded when I close and open the document again, so that&#x27;s annoying
 If anyone knows how to do this using web-mode that&#x27;d be really helpful (soz if I didn&#x27;t use the right terminology for some stuff, still new to emacs, loving it so far lol)
 (Bonus points if there&#x27;s a way to have all tags be folded except for 
, 
 and  tags)

                    <span>It may surprise few but recently I have tried to move my setup from running Emacs in GUI to Emacs running in terminal and it has been rough. With emacs lacking something like vscode-server, it becomes very important for emacs to support terminal mode as first class citizen (to be used in environment such github codespaces etc). Things that don&#x27;t work for example:
 ​
  
Most themes have poor/non-existant support for terminal. Various things like diff mode etc look pretty bad out of box in some themes (bad as in point of making diff unreadable).
 Out of box for example, flycheck-mode errors don&#x27;t show up in terminal mode until you hunt down and enable errors to be displayed in margin.
 Since we don&#x27;t have fringes in terminal, since I was displying bookmarks in fringe, no visual bookmarks either.
 Things like dap-mode etc don&#x27;t work properly. Again part of this is, lack of fringes in terminal mode.
  
​
 I think having some sort of fringe in terminal emacs will make it better but then it falls to individual mode writers (but I don&#x27;t know if core emacs can somehow make it easier).

                    <span>Every once in a while I do something -- maybe I hit the wrong key combination, maybe I trigger an error of some kind -- and my window configuration gets completely screwed up. Usuall this means a carefully-configured frame (well tab really) of 3 or 4 windows suddenly gets switched to a single window and displays some other buffer.
 I have just turned on winner-mode, and so far it seems to be helping me recover when this happens. But I would also like to be able to diagnose why this is happening. 
 I have a pretty long emacs-init file and probably I have some bad values configured; in fact, it seems likely to me that there is more than one culprit. I&#x27;d love to figure out exactly what is triggering this undesirable behaviour, but I don&#x27;t know to do this. Like, could I somehow add a hook that logs the name of the function that is forcing the change? Or is there some set of variables that is likely responsible for the issue? I could search my config for those, I guess. 
 Anyway, thanks for the help in advance!

 https://bitbucket.org/ucorpintegration/workspace/snippets/zXX4My is my current dot-emacs file.
 I work on 3 kinds of projects: 
  
PHP/Symfony ones
 Typescript/React ones
 Python ones
  
I built my dot-emacs file from a tutorial for TypeScript configuration (TIDE), then added the PHP configuration (Intelephense), and then the Python one.
 I just made it work, because I dont know much about Lisp. But maybe you could help and advise on some redundant or duplicate snippets that can make it better.
 Thank you for your help.

                    <span>I&#x27;m having an interesting issue with my current emacs configuration.
 I am hitting a general emacs bug/feature, but I&#x27;m not really sure why this is the case. So I&#x27;m hoping someone else has come across it.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Terminal 1
 emacs --daemon -Q # Start emacs with default configuration emacsclient -nw . # Start a dired buffer in current directory
 Within emacs navigate to the scratch buffer
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Terminal 2
 emacsclient -nw .
 then eval the following (quit-window t)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Expectation
 Terminal 2 client closes back to cli
 Reality
 Both Terminal clients close back to the cli
 Does anyone have any thoughts on why this may be?

There is syncing between Orgzly and Dropbox, and my computer and Dropbox. Mismatch can happen so I make sure that I only edit 1 version at a time. I can get the notification on my phone from Orgzly, so I can either : check off the task on my phone, or check off the task on emacs. So far so good, but my only source of notification is from my phone, my computer does not give the notifications. Is there a way to make it show the notifications, I only need to show the schedule and time for a todo list? I am using Arch and Dunst is my notification daemon.

 ESC TAB brings up the other (and you can see in the screenshots that I use SPC to be able to flip between them).
 I use several machines, so the division here is that the main transient is present on all of them, but the personal one can be configured differently for each (eg for different OS specific things or different uses).

                    <span>My project looks something like this (I&#x27;m trying to link to OpenGL ES 2.0 through angle):
 myprog ├── LICENSE ├── Setup.hs ├── cbits │ └── foreign.c ├── dist │ ├── include │ │ └── GLES2 │ │ ├── gl2.h │ │ └── gl2ext.h │ └── lib │ └── libGLESv2.dylib ├── source │ └── Main.hs ├── myprog.cabal └── stack.yaml 
 with excerpt from myprog.cabal:
  include-dirs: dist/include/ extra-lib-dirs: dist/lib/ extra-libraries: GLESv2 
 stack build works excellent, but stack exec myprog says:
 dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libGLESv2.dylib Referenced from: /Users/bookmarkme/Source/myprog/.stack-work/install/x86_64-osx/07c341abec984457f6475aa6182b68cff317903155c2f451476c7dc80c71caf2/8.2.2/bin/myprog Reason: image not found [1] 26934 abort stack exec myprog 
 What is wrong (why doesn&#x27;t myprog find and load libGLESv2.dylib)? How can I make this work? 
 Thank you.

                    <span>Hello everyone, 
 I have a question regarding further information. For one of my classes we have to do an assignment and I absolutely have no idea where to start. The provided literature (and my clumsy attempts at googling for definitions of the terms used in the assignment) haven&#x27;t made things clearer for me in the slightest as we are only at the point in the book where it describes what things like length, head, and tail do. 
 When looking at the text below, could anyone perhaps refer me to a YouTube video/website that gives more information on the topic or that can guide me in the right direction? I&#x27;m not looking for the answer to the question just literature.
 Just looking for a way to learn how to do this myself since I&#x27;m getting frustrated. I feel as if no one else in the class is st…</span>

                    <span>This is a hard question to ask, because people are used to taking machine integers as primitives, so they don&#x27;t really get what I&#x27;m trying to say. The thing is, all hash functions are designed to be fast in conventional processors. But there are contexts where ints either don&#x27;t exist, or aren&#x27;t the most efficient option. For example, zk-snark circuits don&#x27;t have the usual machine integers, and brainfuck has only inc/dec/if. If you wanted fast hash functions on these environments, it is unlikely that sha2/keccak/blake would perform better than something designed for them.
 I&#x27;m particularly looking for a hash function that is efficient on the pure untyped λ-calculus. Without native integers, our best bet is to λ-encode the data, thus, the most powerful primitive we have is pattern-matching. The performance of a hash function can thus be measured/approximated by the amount of pattern-matches it performs. The question is: what are simple hash functions that perform well on such context?
 I&#x27;ve asked this question on Stack Overflow, but it didn&#x27;t receive attention, which is why I&#x27;m reposting here. If anyone has any idea, thought or inspiration, please let me know!

 You can read more about the job offer and company here. I already answered some questions that were brought up in my previous post; feel free to leave any other questions in the comments and I&#x27;ll get to them asap :).
 Looking forward to meeting some of you soon!

                    <span>I am asking here since this is a relatively big sub in the domain of fp so I can get lot of interesting replies from smart people here.
 Some devs says
  
Functional code is cryptic, hard to understand so hard to onboard new devs.
  
There is truth to that statement. How do you convince someone like that to use FP? 
 Some say not going to the extreme of FP. Is there any advantages / use cases of going to extreme of FP?
 What benefits you yield by moving to a FP from imperative programming? Please share your experience.

 If you have an alternative to achieve this I would appreciate the suggestions.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got some habits that repeat on irregular cycles that I&#x27;d like to schedule with custom functions via diary expressions--which works totally fine except that it doesn&#x27;t seem to jive with the STYLE: habit property.
 Really what I want is to be able to use my custom lisp functions to specify the deadline and schedule dates for a handful of tasks, but when I mark them as DONE I want them to automatically cycle back to the initial TODO state and not show up on my agenda for the rest of the day.
 Does anyone have a way to accomplish this or something similar?

 But when I do:

 It works as expected.
 Even in debug-mode I don&#x27; understand why in column 1 (- $2 $3) is -92 and not 19. (and why the others are 0 in the first example)

                    <span>Hi there,
 tldr; I can&#x27;t see a module for ebay sales / purchases integration, as a hobby buyer / seller that&#x27;d be useful for me. Am I deaming or could I cobble something together?
 background
 I&#x27;ve been using org-mode about a year now on all my devices. 
 I&#x27;m keen to unlock the customisable power of org, so am setting up things like mu4e (couldn&#x27;t fathom notMuch)
 what I want to do
 I am a hobbyist who needs to keep track of spend for tax reasons. My accountant said: &quot;treat yourself to a spreadsheet&quot; so that&#x27;s what I intend to do.
 I basically just have to keep a running total of ebay sales and purchases, which I can run some formulae on at year end. 
 I thought org-tables would be useful for this, and would like to avoid manual entry of the data.
 what I&#x27;ve tried so far
 I&#x27;ve searched for an org or emacs ebay module but not found anything.
 I&#x27;ve researched excel export of ebay data (as a middleman) but not seen anything useful.

                    <span>I am interested in developing an application with pursecript that would work with diagrams drawn by the user. I&#x27;m looking for a library/package that would provide the drawing functionality for me to minimise development time. I&#x27;m thinking of functionality somewhat like Microsoft Visio (e.g. place shapes, connect shapes, move shapes, autorouting of connectors etc.). 
 Are there any libraries/packages either natively or wrapped in purescript? Failing that, are there any suitable javascript libraries I could use through FFI?
 Everything I&#x27;ve found myself is either a dead project, intended for data display (i.e. graphs), static (i.e. closer to MS Paint than Visio) or contains too much functionality (e.g. more general rendering libraries for games or multimedia). I&#x27;d rather not roll my own if I can help it :)
 Any help or advice you could provide would be appreciated.

                    <span>I am aware that GUI is not sexy these days, nevertheless it might be interesting how to create a GUI application with Scala.
 Scalqa provides Fx package, which is a wrapper of JavaFx technology. JavaFx is difficult to use because of cumbersome data model, designed more for automated tools, rather than programmers writing logic.
 Scalqa provides observable collections and properties of its own, which are human friendly and are adopted to JavaFx, making codding easy.
 Let&#x27;s create a simple application &quot;Fri the 13th Explorer&quot;, which allows to select centuries, and browse &quot;Fri the 13th&quot; days within.
 import scalqa.{*, given} object Fri13ThExplorer extends Fx.Application(400, 600, &quot;Fri the 13th Explorer.&quot;): // Creating UI object View extends Fx.Pane.Split: orientation &#x3D; HORIZONTAL add(Centuries, 40.Percent) add(Days) // Century Table Definition object Centuries extends Fx.Table[Int]: new Column[String](&quot;Centuries&quot;, 100, _.toString + &quot; Century&quot;) items ++&#x3D; 1  21 // Add centuries from 1st to 21st sortMode &#x3D; \/ // No sorting // Allow multi selection selection.mode &#x3D; Fx.Selection.Mode.Multiple // Days Table Definition object Days extends Fx.Table[Day]: new Column[Int]( &quot;Year&quot;, 50, _.year.number) new Column[Int]( &quot;Month&quot;, 70, _.month.number) new Column[String](&quot;Day&quot;, 70, d &#x3D;&gt; d.weekDay.tag + &quot;, &quot; + d.number) // On change, re-build days Centuries.selection.onChangeRun { ordering &#x3D; \/ // Reset ordering items.replaceAll( Centuries.selection.~ .flatMap(c &#x3D;&gt; (c - 1) * 100 &gt; c * 100) .map(_.Year) .flatMap(_.days) .filter(_.number &#x3D;&#x3D; 13) .filter(_.weekDay.isFri) ) } 
 The easiest way to run this example is to &quot;git&quot; samplesFx repository and runMain example.fx.table.Fri13ThExplorer in SBT.
 The GUI will look like:

                    <span>I like to scale up and scale down the size of some monospace fonts I commonly use in my fontconfig itself so that all fonts on my system have approximately the same height at any give size. Every application from web browsers to terminal emulators follow these settings without any problems. Emacs, however, doesn&#x27;t. I know I can change font sizes in my init file for Emacs but that Isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m looking for. 
 I&#x27;m using the emacs-git package from the Arch Linux User Repository.
 My ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;      ]&gt;   Fantasque Sans Mono  pixelsize, &amp;upscale;  
  Ubuntu Mono  pixelsize, &amp;upscale;    Consolas  pixelsize, &amp;upscale;    Monoid  pixelsize, &amp;downscale;

                    <span>I have to frequently work on remote machines and I have an efficient way to login to them using &#x60;tramp&#x60; and I can also open a shell from the remote directory. However, I find that the commands that I use in a session on the remote shell are not present in future sessions or when I log in to the same machine outside emacs. So what I am trying to achieve is a way to open a shell/term which will save history over multiple sessions as well these history could be accessed when logging in outside emacs.
 I know there is &#x60;savehist-mode&#x60; but I don&#x27;t know if it works for tramp sessions and if anyone elaborates on this, that would be very nice.

                    <span>Specifically, I am using ox-hugo to write my blog in Hugo.
 I am writing a lot about functional programming and have a lot of code snippets in the Racket language. It uses a lot of Lambda-syntax and I would like the lambda keyword to be exported using the actual Greek letter for Lambda (λ). Why? Cause I like the aesthetics, and it&#x27;s more readable if you have a lot of them in a snippet.
 So, basically, this code block: scheme (product (lambda (i) i) 1 inc 6) 
 Should be exported to HTML like this: scheme (product (λ (i) i) 1 inc 6) 
 Currently, it just looks the same in HTML as it does in the code block.
 Any help is appreciated!

                    <span>Hello All, 
 I plan to share a series of posts where I described the implementation of techniques in the book Crafting Interpreters with Haskell. I have the implementation of the first chapter Scanner.hs and a description of the chapter as a personal blog post here
 My experience with Parsec is limited to toy interpreters. I will appreciate any feedback on the implementation and the commentary of the implementation.

                    <span>Functor, Monoid, Monad, Applicative. These seem kinda simple but everyone explains them in really different ways each time. So to solidify my understanding of these words...
 Can someone explain each one of these concepts with little to none programming terminology? Oh code example are welcomed too. I&#x27;m just trying to get similar answers from everyone so then maybe it&#x27;ll click.
 , &gt;&gt;&#x3D;, , oh and what do these do?

                    <span>There are many articles out there, explaining the famous quote &quot;a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors&quot;, but I&#x27;ve only found versions using product categories (, monoidal categories), and join (m (m a) -&gt; m a).
 Is it possible to explain the quoted statement without product categories and join, by using Kleisli composition instead?
 Let a &#x3D; b &#x3D; c, functions (a -&gt; b) under composition ((a -&gt; b) -&gt; (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)) with id (a -&gt; a) form a monoid, and so do monadic functions (a -&gt; m b) under Kleisli composition ((a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c)) with pure (a -&gt; m a). I would simply find it nice if this fact could be used for an explanation. :)

                    <span>I can think of one example (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong): With the vector-sized library, if I currently index 5 into a vector that&#x27;s known at compile-time to be only of size 2, I don&#x27;t currently get a compile-time error, but an error will be thrown at runtime. I&#x27;m guessing after dependent types get introduced, this library&#x27;s developers can turn this into a compile-time error without any extra effort for the users of the library.

I’d like to keep separate configuration for work and home, and be able to toggle between them when I switch contexts. The agenda files, capture templates and refile targets would be totally different but some other configuration like font faces would be shared. Does anybody have a similar system separating their work and home life in org mode? Any tips would be much appreciated. 
 I’m using Spacemacs as my editor.

 when running org-latex-export-to-latex for some reason it adds [] which causes it to not to work , i have no idea why is this happening .
 here&#x27;s my emacs config.
 ;; Code Highlight (require &#x27;ox-latex) (setq org-latex-listings &#x27;minted) 
 and in test.org

 When removing [] it then compiles like expected with code block and syntax highlighting.

                    <span>Hi all, first post! I&#x27;ve been using emacs for about 8 years and org-mode for about 4-years (though I use org-mode without really &quot;thinking like an org-mode user&quot;), but there are a few things that continue to be annoying / make me feel uninformed. I wanted to &quot;air out&quot; the main inconvenience to see if there are some established solutions and learn new ways to think, and this community looks to be a good place to start!
 The main problem is the following: 
  
Often, I have a note (that can be a paper/book I read, or a conversation, or a life event) which I want to appear in several &quot;views.&quot; This feels repetitive.

                    <span>I like to read a book in one window and take notes in org-mode in another. I like to put a link to the book I&#x27;m reading in the note file so I can open it when I want to study again. Unfortunately, two things happen that are annoying. The link that I store always has some pdf junk at the end rather than a page number.
 Example: file:~/Library/Written/Medicine/Harrisons_Principles_Of_Internal_Medicine_17Ed_18Ed_19Ed_By_Samerbo/Harrisons19Ed/Harrisons19Ed.pdf::%PDF-1.6^M%\342\343\317\323
 Also, even though it used to open the links in the same frame, but new window, now the links always open the books in a new frame. Is this normal behavior?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve coded small projects in Scala back in 2018, and not again ever since. I learned it using and udemy course, which is out of date as of Scala 3. At the time I used GRADLE instead of SBT, because I needed to config proxy settings.
 I noticed that Scala 3 is out and there are some changes that are not backwards compatible.
 So, what material would tou recommend to learn it (again) from ZERO? Video courses, reading material, etc.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying add syntax highlighting when exporting from org to latex using minted , however when i try to compile it to a pdf , the code block doesn&#x27;t even show up and after few searching i found this .
 \begin{minted}[]{common-lisp} (defun Fib (n) (if (&lt; n 2) n (+ (Fib (- n 1)) (Fib (- n 2))))) \end{minted} 
 when org-latex-export-to-latex for some reason it adds [] which causes it to not to work , i have no idea why is this happening .
 here&#x27;s my emacs config.
 ;; Code Highlight (require &#x27;ox-latex) (setq org-latex-listings &#x27;minted) 
 and in test.org
 #+LATEX_CLASS: article #+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [letterpaper] #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{minted} #+OPTIONS: toc:t 
 When removing [] it then compiles like expected with code block and syntax highlighting.

                    <span>On macOS with Emacs 28 built from git master, most Emoji display fine with the help of the unicode-fonts package, configured via spacemacs. However, I can&#x27;t get those Emoji using ZWJ (zero width joiner) to work. E.g 👩‍❤️‍👨 displays is displayed in a sequence of 3 emoji instead of a single combined one. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/IQ7YhUE For reference, this is supposed to look like this: https://imgur.com/rwUklg4
 How can I get Emacs to display those Emoji as a single combined Emoji as macOS does?

                    <span>Coming from a vim + tmux background, the way display-buffer chooses to pop-up or overwrite existing windows can be kind of annoying. At first, I just set display-buffer-base-action to prefer putting buffers in the current window. Then, I started thinking about e.g. help buffers - I actually did want them to pop up sometimes, because I didn&#x27;t want to have to create a new window, switch to it, and then open help every time I wanted to look up a function. However, after spending an hour working on getting display-buffer-alist to demonstrate my desired behavior, I realized I had created a really similar configuration to the default display-buffer logic.
 At this point, I started to wonder if the problem was just with me - maybe my problem with windows is that I don&#x27;t grok buffers. Maybe there&#x27;s a Zen of window management where - when magit appears on top of the mu4e buffer with the commit hash your lead was telling you to look at, or help pops up and squishes the window with your code into a postage stamp - a more seasoned graybeard would react with equanimity, recognizing that carefully cultivated window configurations were ephemeral, but that their contents are everlasting, and be able to retrieve and reorder things without getting annoyed or losing flow.
 Or, maybe display-buffer just sucks. I&#x27;m interested to hear what more experienced users think!

                    <span>Hi,
 Today when trying to check some checkboxes in an org file, using C-c C-c as I always do it no longer worked. Instead I get C-c C-c- in the Minibuffer, like it is now treating C-c C-c as a prefix key in Org..?
 It seems to be something in my Init files, as it works as expected with emacs -q and then loading same Org file, but I can&#x27;t for my life figure out what change might have caused this.
 And it seems Org related as C-c C-c works as expected in other modes (i.e. does nothing C-c C-c is undefined in ordinary text file)
 *Sigh* ... Any ideas where I could look?
 
 When asking in r/orgmode it was suggested to try with which-key mode, which I did. But only difference is then I get
 C-c C-c- which-key: There are no keys to show
 in Minibuffer when I do the C-c C-c on the checkboxes..?

                    <span>Quite literally, although maybe not very useful I just love how literally it is
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 $ emacs --batch --eval &quot;(while t (print (eval (read))))&quot; Lisp expression: (defun factorial (x) (if (&gt; x 0) (* (factorial (1- x)) x) 1)) factorial Lisp expression: (factorial 5) 120 Lisp expression: Error reading from stdin 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (I pressed ^D at the last input)
 It&#x27;s a bit useful for me as I&#x27;m experimenting shipping batch mode emacs as Elisp interpreter for Elisp applications.

                    <span>For a few days I&#x27;ve been experimenting with Anki and SuperMemo (Spaced Repetition Software).
 One thing that is cool in SuperMemo is that I can import a long document and extract a few parts to create flashcards. Although anki-editor can export an org-mode tree to Anki cards, I would need to change all the notes I&#x27;ve taken (with org-roam) and adapt the structure to create cards.
 I thought that the cards should be as close as possible to the notes so I created a special-block called #+BEGIN_ANKI that has other special blocks for the card fields.
 The block looks like this:
 #+ATTR_DECK: Test #+ATTR_TYPE: Cloze #+ATTR_TAGS: incremental-reading emacs #+BEGIN_ANKI org #+ATTR_FIELD: Text #+BEGIN_FIELD {{c1::Observer pattern}} is a Software Design Pattern in which an object, named the ~subject~, maintains a list of its dependents, called {{c2::~observers~}}, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. #+END_FIELD #+END_ANKI 
 I created a package org-mode-incremental-reading that sends this block to Anki (through anki-connect) so I can learn/remember all my notes.
 I&#x27;m sharing this package so that it may help someone who also uses org-mode for notes and Anki.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>At work, I&#x27;m forced to use an old version of Emacs: GNU Emacs 23.1.1.
 Two things about ediff:
 1) I&#x27;m using ediff-window-setup-function to be ediff-setup-windows-plain. What I want and expect is to have, upon ediff invocation, two &quot;windows&quot; onto the two buffers being diff&#x27;ed that take up almost all of the frame and a one-line &quot;window&quot; for the Control Frame. Instead, I get five windows: the one I invoked ediff from takes a quarter of the frame, a duplicate of that takes a quarter, the Ediff Control Frame takes a quarter, and the two buffers being diff&#x27;ed each take an eighth. Yuk! Can anyone figure out how to make this do what I want?
 2) I have noticed that when it has invoked in that ugly configuration, I can get the configuration to the way I want by hitting &quot;|&quot; twice. &quot;|&quot; is bound to ediff-toggle-split. So I tried to work around the issue by doing:
 (defun fix-ediff-windows () (interactive)
 (message &quot;FEW&quot;)
 (ediff-toggle-split)
 (ediff-toggle-split)
 )
 (add-hook &#x27;ediff-after-setup-windows-hooks &#x27;fix-ediff-windows)
 but it appears that somehow this hook is not being honored. If I describe-variable on ediff-after-setup-windows-hooks, it does show that it has the value fix-ediff-windows, but upon invoking ediff, there is no message &quot;FEW&quot; and the ediff-toggle-split&#x27;s are not invoked.
 Can anyone figure out a solution to either issue?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a beginner and a bit confused about how typeclass names, like Functor or Monoid, are used in speech.
 To make my question more concrete, consider the following examples:
  
The set of all values of type f a and the operation fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b together form an algebra (algebraic structure) which is a Functor. An algebra is considered to be a Functor when it has one operation fmap which satisfies certain laws.
 If there exists an operation fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b, then the type constructor f is called a functor.
 The function fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b is called a functor.
  
Which of these sentences are correct?
 My intuition is that the first example, describing an algebra formed by the pair (values of f a, fmap), is the most correct/universal, and similar thing…</span>

                    <span>constraint-rules provides a way to extend GHC&#x27;s type checker with custom rules without having to write your own type checker plugin. See https://github.com/YellPika/constraint-rules for more info and some example code.
 The plugin is in a usable state but I have yet to publish it on Hackage because it&#x27;s still a bit rough around the edges (error locations are sometimes wrong, it probably doesn&#x27;t handle dependent kinds properly, the test suite is lacking, there&#x27;s not enough documentation, etc). If any brave souls are willing to give it a spin, I would appreciate any feedback.

                    <span>I am trying to create a shortcut to my current shortcut to my org-capture.
 - Current shortcut : C-c c j
 - New shortcut : F9 function key using following custom code
 (defun my/journalcapture() &quot;Journal entry by project&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (org-capture &quot;j&quot;)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/journalcapture) 
 The error I am getting is this
 Wrong number of arguments: (lambda nil &quot;Journal entry by project&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (org-capture nil &quot;j&quot;)), 1
 Org-capture function definition is as below
 org-capture (&amp;optional goto keys)
 I am not able to understand what is goto and how to define keys
 Previously, I have successfully set up shortcut for agenda. From C-c a R to F12 using code below.
 I am not sure what&#x27;s the difference.
 (defun my/dailyagenda(&amp;optional arg) &quot;Daily agenda&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (org-agenda arg &quot;R&quot;) (delete-other-windows)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/dailyagenda)

 ** Export Locations :PROPERTIES: :EXPORT_FILE_NAME_01: file1 :EXPORT_FILE_NAME_02: file2 :EXPORT_FILE_NAME_03: file3 :EXPORT_FILE_NAME_04: file4 :END:

                    <span>With recent changes to The Archive, I&#x27;ve noticed one oddity in my old notes - perhaps worth pointing out.
First, I create a new note using @Will &#x27;s Keyboard Maestro macro.  An empty new note looks like:

Now, I noticed when going into older Zettels, that my internal and external references were getting bolded as shown below (this is from the end of a note on &quot;Equality in Death&quot; containing my comments on a Daily Stoic post of the same title):

I found that to get back to the format I was expecting, I had to add a carriage return after the last bit of text (which was not required previously):

From the perspective of The Archive and how it operates, this is a minor, silly item, but the extra bolding bothers me aesthetically and so I find myself obsessively going through old zettles, adding a carriage return near the end.</span>

                    <span>Looking over I see the use of thearchive://matchOrCreate/TERM is suppose to create a document with the TERM.  However, if the document doesn&#x27;t exist, it looks like it&#x27;s creating a zettel with just a new Zettel ID.</span>

 Any pointers?

                    <span>Hello.
 Recently started using org-roam at work for taking and organizing notes. Works so far good. However, since the last couple of days I noticed that org-indent-mode (and also some other org-mode keymappings) gets &#x27;deactivated&#x27;. It is fixed by just invoking &#x27;org-mode&#x27; again, however it is a bit annoying to quite frequently invoke this again and again.
 I am fairly new to emacs but I am trying to learn what happens and why. I am both interested in why this happens but I also want to know how to properly debug this so I can figure out if this is a feature/bug or just a setting I can tweak.
 What I have found out so far is that it is happening whenever I open a node that is not already loaded into a buffer (e.g. if I re-visit a node it doesn&#x27;t happen). So seems something is happening when &#x27;org-roam-node-find&#x27; and later &#x27;org-roam-node-file&#x27; ?
 This is not happening on my personal computer but only on my work computer (so far). Using almost identical emacs setup for both, using doom-emacs.
 Anyone experienced anything similar or have some suggestions on how to fix/debug this further?

                    <span>PlantUML now can insert blocks with formatted equations but requires JLaTexMath to form the formatted equation for the .png image. I have not been able to get this to work in a plantuml source block per this example on Page 19 of the plantuml reference manual. Has anyone running Win10 tried this and ran it successfully - which means you found how to make jLaTexMath available? (What a great feature! Kudos to plantuml coders)

                    <span>I am new to emacs (via doom), so sorry if this is a simple question. I&#x27;m looking to edit remote files on a server, but there are two ssh connections required. Essentially, I need to edit files on Sever B, but I must connect to Server A before connecting to Server B. It goes: ssh Server A -&gt; ssh Server B (while in Server A).
 So how could I accomplish this connection within emacs, so I can use my local emacs to edit files on Server B? Is there a package that&#x27;s used for this or does (doom) emacs have a built in functionality for this?

 Major improvements on the other popular Emacs keybindings extensions are support for multi cursor compatibility, kill-ring being integrated with the system clipboard, rectangle mode, prefix argument, better variety of meta key assignments such as ESC, C-[ and Cmd, mark-ring, s-exp, and others.
 Please forgive the small bit of self-promotion; just wanted to share this with the community as a fellow emacs enthusiast :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to get a helpful little library working that will let me define all my dir-locals in my config, but I am unable to get &#x60;dir-locals-set-class-variables&#x27; and &#x60;dir-locals-set-directory-class&#x27; to ultimately work.
 I&#x27;ve compacted it down into one file of ERT tests that work up until you try to get the variables&#x27; local value in a file in the directory I&#x27;ve set up class variables for. I only ever get the default value.
 Anyone have any experience with this?

                    <span>So, I&#x27;ve noticed alot of functions behave totally differently when called via M-x vs a regular call vs a which-key call. Specifically I want to create wrappers around some functions to have them do something before or after a function gets called via a keyboard shortcut, but for whatever reason, I either don&#x27;t get how / what M-x actually passes as variables or the manner in which it is called and what it does differently and then what makes that different vs an interactive which key. 
 I&#x27;m on mobile right now, so it&#x27;s hard to offer examples, but if you know what I&#x27;m talking about, please educate me, because I&#x27;m not sure what I should be looking for exactly wrt documentation to autodidact it.

                    <span>Hi, im a newbie emacs user, i started to get comfy with it and i already installed a bunch of packages. 
 I constantly see people using use-package instead of &#x27;require and stuff. So i did a little research and started to modify my init.el to use use-package. 
 I have got setted various variables about org-agenda , for example:
 (setq org-icalendar-include-body nil) (setq org-icalendar-alarm-time 5) (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/path/file.org&quot; )) 
 These are lines at the end of my init.el ; If i want to use use-package for everything i would have to set that variables after a : (use-package org-agenda :init ) ? Or how? Its the same? 
 Thanks

                    <span>Hello! I found a blog post a while ago with a really interesting Emacs mode. Can&#x27;t find it for the life of me, so I&#x27;ll give all the details I can remember.
 The mode kept 2 buffers in sync, showing the same data in different formats. Edits in either would be instantly converted to the other. For example, inserting an org header &quot;* xyz&quot; in one might add a markdown header &quot;# xyz&quot; in the other.
 It was (in theory) extensible to use any 2 formats that can round-trip convert to one another I think it only supported one pair of formats currently, as a test. I also think it was from a few years ago, maybe 2017.
 The author worked in (computional?) low-level biology, I think DNA sequencing, or something related like blood research. Can&#x27;t remember if academic or industry. I think they maybe had a post about using Emacs to edit/explore sequence data from RNA/DNA.

                    <span>For instance, whenever I create a NEW file with ORG extension ,the file autometically insert these at the top:
 #+title: 
 #+author:
 #+email:
 #+date: 
 Can I do it natively without using any 3rd party package? At this moment org-roam-insert-file do only #+title at the top.
 Kindly shed some light. I have look at org-roam source code for the specific function and it looks bloody daunting. 
 Heads up! I am on org-roam V1 and would like to stay with it.

                    <span>Well, it might be a laughably stupid query , but I failed to find some answer . 
 What I have in my .emacs/init.el is this code snipet,which invoked by the key C-x-r-..then the key corresponding to the source code block wanted to enter. Take a peek ..
 (set-register ?p &quot;#+begin_src perl\n\n#+end_src&quot;)
 (set-register ?b &quot;#+begin_src bash\n\n#+end_src&quot;)
 (set-register ?s &quot;#+begin_src sh\n\n#+end_src&quot;)
 (set-register ?c &quot;#+begin_src C\n\n#+end_src&quot;)
 (set-register ?l &quot;#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n\n#+end_src&quot;)
 Now , the trouble is , the damn cursor end up at the end of end_src block....which should be in between the block. For instance ..
 #+begin_src perl
 [But the curson suppose to be here or wanted to be here]
 #+end_src [cursor stand here by default]
 Shed some light.

                    <span>Hi, I recently changed the icon for emacsclient so I can differentiate between emacs and emacsclient on my gnome3 dock. I did this by adding a .desktop launcher file to ~/.local/share/applications and it seems to have worked quite nicely.
 However, when I open emacsclient using the launcher, it assigns the normal emacs icon to the newly opened emacsclient frame and it&#x27;s driving me up the wall :D Any help/tips/suggestions will be appreciated ! Perhaps it has something to do with StartupWMClass ?

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 TL:DR: I want to use query-replace in an open dired buffer, which considers the file-names of ALL directories and subdirectories present in said buffer. Is that possible? How?
 I am trying to get my music sorted using the beet music library manager. So far, it works quite well. However, I own some more or less obscure music for which there are no proper musicbrainz entries so that the proper tagging/renaming doesn&#x27;t work.
 Now, I am tempted to simply ignore one source of error - a suffix such as &quot;(Original Mix)&quot; appended to the &quot;ARTIST - TITLE&quot; scheme. This way, I am able to get more tagging done and have less manual work to do afterwards.
 However, I want this problem fixed at a later stage, and I thought I might as well just open a dired buffer, and query-replace should have me covered (in combination with wdired). And it does - provided that I have opened one particular (sub-)directory to which query-replace is then applied. But since I don&#x27;t know in which directory the &quot;bad&quot; file namings are to be found, I would have to open any and all subdirectories manually for this method to work. Unacceptable (think of Lemongrab in Adventure Time :D)
 Is there a possibility to make dired / query-replace behave in the way that I expect / want them to? Are there other utilities (in emacs or else) that can do what I want?
 Any tips / advice are very welcome. Have a good day, folks!
 EDIT: It seems like I&#x27;ve just been offered two probably working solutions. One includes invoking M-x find-dired RET RET, while the other consists in changing the subdir switch to include -R (in dired, C-u s, then -R). Will test both in due time, but so far, thanks a bunch, u/protesilaos and u/xenodium!
 EDIT2: I&#x27;ve settled with the solution suggested by u/protesilaos. I appreciate when I can stay within the dired interface, and changing the subdir switch seems more intuitive to me.
 Thanks a bunch, folks!

 Is there some way to configure it to do that, or some variant in the ivy family that does that?

 Flags:
 --with-sound&#x3D;alsa
 --with-xwidgets
 --without-libsystemd
 --without-selinux
 --with-native-compile (also tried without this, doesn&#x27;t work too)
 --with-x
 --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;yes (also tried gtk variants)
 and some other misc flags..

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use a GADT with DataKinds, as shown below
 {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures, DataKinds, GADTs #-} module NewGadt where data ExprType &#x3D; Var | Nest data Expr (a :: ExprType) where ExprVar :: String -&gt; Expr Var ExprNest :: Expr a -&gt; Expr Nest data BaseExpr &#x3D; BaseExprVar String | BaseExprNest BaseExpr translate :: BaseExpr -&gt; Expr a translate (BaseExprVar id) &#x3D; ExprVar id translate (BaseExprNest expr) &#x3D; ExprNest $ translate expr 
 Compile error:
 /home/elijah/code/monty/src/NewGadt.hs:15:32: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘a’ with ‘&#x27;Var’ ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: bexprToExpr :: forall (a :: ExprType). BaseExpr -&gt; Expr a at src/NewGadt.hs:14:1-33 Expected type: Expr a Actual type: Expr &#x27;Var • In the expression: ExprVar id In an equation for ‘bexprToExpr’: bexprToExpr (BaseExprVar id) &#x3D; ExprVar id • Relevant bindings include bexprToExpr :: BaseExpr -&gt; Expr a (bound at src/NewGadt.hs:15:1) | 15 | bexprToExpr (BaseExprVar id) &#x3D; ExprVar id | ^^^^^^^^^^ 
 I would like to do this so certain functions can only work on a specific type of expr, for example:
 printVariable :: Expr Var -&gt; IO () printVariable (ExprVar id) &#x3D; putStrLn id printNested :: Expr Nest -&gt; IO () printNested (ExprNest inner) &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;nested expression&quot; printExpr :: Expr a -&gt; IO () printExpr expr@ExprVar {} &#x3D; printVariable expr printExpr expr@ExprNest {} &#x3D; printNested expr 
 And of course, calling printVariable with an Expr Nest should fail compilation.
 Is there a way I can have the translate function return Expr a like this? Or is this an inappropriate usage of DataKinds &amp; GADTs?

                    <span>Hey all. After hearing so much about haskell.nix and its cross compilation capabilities, I finally decided to give it a go and try cross compiling some of my projects to arm linux and android.
 Following the guides provided by haskell.nix, I was able to get my projects building with nix, and successfully built some static binaries that ran on my pinephone using the aarch64-unknown-musl target. Unfortunately, I have not had as much success with targeting android.
 I was wondering if anyone has had any success cross compiling their Haskell projects via nix (be it haskell.nix or otherwise) to run on Android. I know there is mobile haskell, and a couple of blog posts out there explaining how to build a cross-compiling GHC manually, but I really like the idea of using nix, as it seems like a more hands-off approach, kind of like Rust&#x27;s cross It would be especially helpful if anyone had any projects doing this successfully already that I might be able to take a look at.
 Haskell.nix has worked really nicely for me so far otherwise, so ideally I&#x27;d use that. Is there perhaps some additional configuration I need to add to my default.nix to get my projects building correctly to target Android? I am still very much a nix noob, so I&#x27;m honestly not even sure what sorts of things I can try. Nothing on the haskell.nix documentation seemed particularly relevant to my situation.
 I&#x27;m fine with using any relatively recent version of GHC, but I&#x27;ve been trying to accomplish this with the GHC versions listed as supported by haskell.nix.

                    <span>Is it possible to define a manual instance for a regular data type and then derive an instance for its newtype such that newtype&#x27;s instance wouldn&#x27;t be based on the original data type&#x27;s instance?

 for some reason I&#x27;m getting this error even though i copied it straight from the book :

 I would appreciate if you guys could help me out! Thank You!

                    <span>To what extent could streaming abstractions replace laziness in a hypothetical fully eager Haskell? It seems fairly doable for lists alone.
 Can this pattern be extended to different shapes of data? Let&#x27;s assume we can still make certain things explicitly lazy if needed, yet we choose to use this sparingly.
 The goal would be to get more predictable behavior.

                    <span>Consider memoization. A monomorphic top level definition will be evaluated only once over the run of a program. So, one can retain the values of an expensive function in a top level map, so that they do not need to be recomputed:
 memory ∷ Map Int Int memory &#x3D; Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain 
 However, this polymorphic variant will be evaluated many times — the values will not be retained:
 memory ∷ Num α ⇒ Map α α memory &#x3D; Map.fromSet expensiveFunction domain 
 This polymorphic definition can be specialized by the compiler for some special cases that can then be retained. Memoization will work only when this specialization is performed. So, disabling optimizations will spell death to a program that relies on memoization of a polymorphic function.
 Are there any other examples of compiler optimizations changing asymptotic complexity?

                    <span>I need to execute a source code block programatically, ie the cursor must retain its current position after execution.
 What I have in mind is give the block a name, search for the name, move the cursor 2 lines down to execute org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c, then return to the original location because I used save-excursion.
 Is there some existing API for this task?

                    <span>I upgraded to org 9.4.6 and realize that the org priority defaults are using the literal numerical values that are configured as, rather than converting them to the ASCII values the used before.
 (setq org-default-priority 53 org-highest-priority 48 org-lowest-priority 57) 
 These are my settings and before the upgrade the initial priority of a task was displayed as [#4], but now it results in the display of [#53].
 Was I doing something wrong before, or has the way the org-priority-xxx values are interpreted changed for some time. The version of org I used before was 9.2.3

 As the title says, is there a way to be able to copy text from Google Docs and have it paste (yank) it into org files while retaining the formatting (at least the basics of italics and bold)?

                    <span>I know this method can be called on a string to check if it contains a particular character. 
 For example, i.contains(“#”) would check if the string i contains the hashtag. 
 However, it is not working when I want to check if the string contains quotation marks. 
 i.contains(“””) is not working. 
 What to do about this?

 It&#x27;s this repo: https://github.com/openquant/ibclient
 It looks like the functionality is already there (sbt assembly), but I don&#x27;t really understand that or the scala / Java ecosystem and how to just import it like a normal library

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been learning more about elisp and in general, trying to edit things in a more plain, &quot;Emacs way.&quot; This means trying to do things without a bunch of extra packages installed, while at the same time not breaking my main configuration that&#x27;s used to actually get stuff done.
 To help make these Emacs instances easier to create, I hacked together a shell script to quickly create new, sandboxed environments:

                    <span>For context, I&#x27;m new to emacs, and I&#x27;m just now learning org-mode and org-agenda.
 Right now, it&#x27;s 6:25pm. There&#x27;s an event I scheduled in an org file, from 6:10pm - 7:10pm.
 When I view org-agenda (doing M-x org-agenda, then pressing (a) to view Agenda for current week or day), I want the event scheduled from 6:10pm - 7:10pm to be more &quot;easily viewable&quot;; at the moment it feels hard to tell at a glance what event I should &quot;currently be doing&quot;. This is what it looks like right now: https://imgur.com/a/H9sCewg 
 Any tips or advice? Thank you.

                    <span>Here&#x27;s my super stripped-down config, where the main moving parts are yasnippet, company, and lsp-mode.
 I&#x27;d like for company to suggest yasnippet snippets while I&#x27;m typing. Outside of lsp-mode, I can append :with company-yasnippet to a backend or list of backends in company-backends, and my snippets are suggested just fine.
 However, while in lsp-mode, company-capf is appended to the front of the list of backends, shadowing those instances of company-yasnippet. From what I understand (and what seems to have worked for this other post facing the exact same problem), the language server should still recommend snippets if lsp-enable-snippet is non-nil, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me. Is there something wrong with my configuration, or am I misunderstanding how snippet suggestion works in lsp-mode?

                    <span>I&#x27;m posting to announce defblog, a wrapper for org-publish to support some common features of blogging systems.
 I wrote this package as a rage-quit of Wordpress, which I&#x27;d been using with org2blog. One day it stopped working! And rather than tedium of debugging what latest version mismatch was probably playing up this time, I decided to jump to WP-free and all-org.
 defblog keeps the distinction between posts with categories vs. pages as in WP, reading Org source from a designated source directory. It generates/rsyncs the whole site at each publish, which might be too much for you if you have a truly huge or very frequently updated site. It also generates Atom/RSS feeds and a .htaccess file, the latter with Redirect specs for old page URLs.
 Hope you find it useful; suggestions/feedback/pointing-out-that-it&#x27;s-redundant/etc. welcome!

                    <span>I&#x27;m learning elisp through the tutorial and I&#x27;m at the point of starting to play a little with some custom functions. Yesterday I felt the need to have some working tests for a wrapper function I wrote, to save me time through refactoring and code experiments.
 Problem is still have no clue about testing in emacs (or testing my text editor behavior, for that matter). Is the built-in tools OK or they are obsolete nowadays? Which runner, framework should I use? Any popular assertion libraries? I don&#x27;t plan to release a package anytime soon, I just want to test once in a while the features I&#x27;m introducing. I&#x27;m using spacemacs btw.
 Ok, before posting this I looked up a bit and found this and this. Buttercup seems great. Links or tips from experienced developers are welcome.

                    <span>I do programming too. I never had a MacBook, so I don’t know how Emacs works in OSX. I tried Emacs in windows, and tbh it was a terrible experience. My best experience with Emacs was with a linux distro(manjaro).

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written a (basic) major mode (my first!) for a simple scripting language with its own syntax. So far I&#x27;ve added font locking, comment insertion/recognition, indentation (but only indenting by 4 spaces when using TAB but that is all that is necessary for now as there is no rules to adhere to). 
 Should a syntax table be a defvar or a defconst or does it matter?
 How can I make comments togglable i.e. how can I uncomment a line, region etc.? I can&#x27;t seem to get that working. If it matters comments can either start with // and end with I guess &quot;&quot; for a single line comment or start with /* and end with */ for a multiline comment. This is specified in my synatx table.
 I would like to add some snippets as the default editor available to us is bundled with snippets for this scripting langua…</span>

                    <span>I am considering moving from mutt to Wanderlust, but I have hit a few snags that the official documentation did not answer.
 I figured out how to make wl auto-detect from which SMTP server to send by which folder I am in. But I cannot figure out how to make wl insert the appropriate signature. Google gave me a hack using mu-cite, but surely there must be a built-in way to do this.
 Another thing that bugs me: can I somehow tell wl to ignore its own SMTP capabilities and just use the msmtp I have already set up? Right now, C-x m uses msmtp, while w in wl does something completely different. Obviously, I want them to do the same thing.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t want to start a new discussion which one is better or why you should E instead of T. It&#x27;s just that I use both (Emacs mostly as an editor and Tiddlywiki as a Zettelkasten/[ideas, quotes,bookmarks] collection). 
 I know there is dfeich/org8-wikiexporters which can export an ORG buffer to valid Tiddlywiki syntax. However I&#x27;m searching for more integrations/tipps&amp;tricks how to get best out of both worlds. 
 Tiddlywiki for example has a great REST API which can be used to create/delete content. Using emacs-request I can access that API and create new content (checkout this function inside my dotfiles). 
 I&#x27;m looking forward to any other ideas how Emacs and Tiddlywiki could be used together. 
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>How do I specify face attributes that should be applied only if face is &quot;notmuch-search-unread-face&quot; NOT &quot;notmuch-tag-face&quot;. Or, if I could specify the attributes for &quot;notmuch-search-unread-face&quot; AND &quot;notmuch-tag-face&quot;. I would basically like tags to be colored different from rest of the text for unread messages.
 Thanks.

                    <span>There&#x27;s two ways to embed intuitionistic logic into linear logic as described here. The first encodes a -&gt; b into !a -o b. This corresponds to call by name evaluation and is the basis of the linearity via arrows approach linear haskell uses. The second way encodes a -&gt; b into !(a -o b). This way corresponds to call by value evaluation and is the basis of linearity via kinds.
 Borrowing the syntax from the linear haskell paper, here&#x27;s an encoding of the !(a -o b) embedding of intuitionistic logic.

 This system uses the same context multiplication that linear haskell uses except it places the multiplication on the lambda rather than the function call. This version of let! let here is limited to only work on functions; but it can be generalized to work with a kind based linearity system or a typeclass based linearity system.
 In linear haskell the multiplicity parameter of an arrow chooses between either !a -o b or a -o b. In this system the multiplicity parameter of an arrow choose between !(a -o b) and a -o b. This choose doesn&#x27;t have to be mutually exclusive. Here&#x27;s a system that supports both.

 Though I think this isn&#x27;t worth the extra complexity.

                    <span>Hi!
 I am struggling with defining an encoding for messages written by error on a windows machine (win10, pwsh, chcp 65001, ghc-8.10.* or 9.0.1).
 Consider this MWE:
 module Main where import System.IO import GHC.IO.Encoding main :: IO () main &#x3D; do hGetEncoding stdout &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print putStrLn &quot;latin&quot; putStrLn &quot;кириллица 1&quot; hGetEncoding stderr &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print hSetEncoding stderr utf8 print &quot;set locale encoding&quot; &gt;&gt; setLocaleEncoding utf8 print &quot;set foreign encoding&quot; &gt;&gt; setForeignEncoding utf8 hPutStrLn stderr &quot;кириллица 2&quot; error &quot;кириллица 3&quot; 
 When executing the resulting binary, the resulting output is
 Just UTF-8 latin кириллица 1 Just UTF-8 &quot;set locale encoding&quot; &quot;set foreign encoding&quot; кириллица 2 codepage-exe.EXE: РєРёСЂРёР»Р»РёС†Р° 3 CallStack (from HasCallStack): error, called at app\\Main.hs:14:5 in main:Main 
 The mojibacke looks like as a result of squeezing a cp1251-encoded Cyrillic text into a utf8-expecting terminal. It is clear that inner workings of error are at play here...
 I am out of ideas for now - is there something else that I can try to make them output correct encoding? Or is it hardcoded?

                    <span>Hi everyone! I think I have a challenging issue in front of me, but I might be wrong. The application I&#x27;m building needs to handle possibly non-terminating computations gracefully and remain responsive while running them. I thought most of the problem would be solved by running it in a separate thread, but it seems a bit more complicated than that. I want to abort a computation when it&#x27;s memory usage hits a certain limit. I thought the -M RTS option would work fine for this, but when the program reaches it&#x27;s memory limit, it just keeps going while memory usage remains more or less constant. However, it seems the application becomes effectively single-threaded for a while before a heap overflow exception is thrown, which makes it very slow to respond. I&#x27;m not able to reproduce it with a simple foldr (+) 0 [1..5000000] though, so it&#x27;s something specific about the computation I&#x27;m running. I&#x27;m thinking the GC is trying very hard for a while to free enough memory for the computation to continue, which causes a time-frame where other threads are blocked a lot and don&#x27;t have memory available for them.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to just keep the application from freezing for more than 100ms while the GC does it&#x27;s work, because sometimes the memory-intensive computation does complete after entering the single-threaded time-frame and I&#x27;m getting the feeling that GHC is a bit lazy about garbage collection while it has enough space, but a way to prevent the unresponsiveness time frame by killing the thread early would also be okay.
 But if someone has a better idea of what&#x27;s going on here that would be nice already. I can publish the full source if needed, but I think it would quite a bit of work to go through/install the application.
 Edit: Using GHC 8.6.5 (because of GHCJS) if that&#x27;s relevant

                    <span>I have some code in C# that I was wondering how it would be implemented in Haskell. I&#x27;ve only written basic Haskell, I&#x27;m trying to learn.
 In C#, it&#x27;s something like this
 var a &#x3D; GetSomeData(); var b &#x3D; GetSomeOtherData(); var c &#x3D; GetFinalData(); var errors &#x3D; new (bool isError, string message)[] { (a is null, &quot;Could not find A&quot;), (b is null, &quot;Could not find B&quot;), (c is null, &quot;Could not find C&quot;), }.Where(t &#x3D;&gt; t.isError).Select(t &#x3D;&gt; t.message); var error &#x3D; string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, errors); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(error)) { return Response(error); } // Process data... return Response(...); 
 In Haskell, I was thinking of modeling a, b, c variables as Eithers with either a value (not necessarily of the same type) or a helpful error String. But then I got stuck. Destructuring sounds like a nested nightmare. I don&#x27;t think I can use a do block because of the different types (right?) and because I want to keep the error messages.
 How could I model the &quot;aggregate and return all error messages, or if nothing&#x27;s wrong keep processing data&quot; idea. Is there a neat solution?
 Thanks!

                    <span>This may get a little ranty, so apologies in advance.
 I&#x27;ve trying to get stack working on NixOS, and I&#x27;m running into some frustrating difficulties. Admittedly the frustration is compounded by my lack of familiarity with Nix, but I feel strongly that I shouldn&#x27;t require especially in depth knowledge to get a basic stack build going. I installed stack using home-manager, if that&#x27;s relevant.
 The first issue I run into when running stack build is: 
  demo@nixos ~/D/f/t/w/workshop8 (my_week8_solutions)&gt; stack build error: attribute &#x27;ghc882&#x27; missing, at (string):1:43 (use &#x27;--show-trace&#x27; to show detailed location information)

                    <span>I&#x27;m writing a program that will need to run an update function for a UI based on an interval the user provides, perhaps as quickly as 15 times a second. Is there a known library with that function ? Much thanks.

                    <span>Hello,
 I know that you can use DEADLINE for tasks to make them show up in the agenda with a warning about the approaching or missed deadline. 
 Can I get the same behavior (show up in the agenda view with a warning some days before the event when the date approaches, basically reminders) with timestamp events (holidays / birthdays / meetings, for example)? 
 I can sort of achieve this when I make the event as and add DEADLINE to it, but I don&#x27;t really ever &quot;complete&quot; these events, and logically these are not deadlines. 
 Any help is appreciated!

                    <span>Hi,
 Today when trying to check some checkboxes in an org file, using C-c C-cas I always do it no longer worked. Instead I get C-c C-c- in the Minibuffer, like it is now treating C-c C-cas a prefix key in Org..?
 It seems to be something in my Init files, as it works as expected with emacs -q and then loading same Org file, but I can&#x27;t for my life figure out what change might have caused this. 
 And it seems Org related as C-c C-c works as expected in other modes (i.e. does nothing C-c C-c is undefinedin ordinary text file)
 *Sigh* ... Any ideas where I could look?

                    <span>For context, I&#x27;m a student looking to move from Vim to (vanilla) Emacs.
 I&#x27;m interested in using Emacs for text editing, task management (TODO, calendar), journalling, notetaking (for school), and some kind of Zettelkasten system (org-roam?).
 What&#x27;s the best way I can combine all of these?
  
Zettelkasten and school lecture notes separate
 Store lecture notes under the appropriate tag in org-roam along with regular Zettelkasten stuff
 ??? How does the calendar, TODO, and journalling fit in?
  
#1 has the advantage of preventing a overly cluttered Zettelkasten (although one could argue lecture notes could be useful inside it, #2). I might expect some overlap between Zettelkasten content and my lecture notes.
 It&#x27;s worth mentioning that I&#x27;d like to leverage Emacs LaTeX packages as well.
 It&#x27;d be useful for me to hear why and how you guys run your Org mode setups, including your use-cases; and I&#x27;m sure it would be useful for other users too.
 ​
 Side note: What&#x27;s a nice way to sync Emacs calendar/TODO across my devices, and to my iPhone?

                    <span>Hello, everybody !
Being a long time lurker of the forum, I&#x27;m making my first post here in order to share with you a free, online workshop that I&#x27;ve created. Basically, it&#x27;s about discovering Joplin  and other software, along with different methods to manage information and organize in our daily lives. Among these methods is the Zettelkasten method; or, at least, what I understand of it.

The point of this post is two-fold: first, I hope that the workshop might make you discover some interesting things that you might use yourself. In particular, I found it interesting to articulate the P.A.R.A method and the Zettelkasten method together, and using open-source software to wrap it all together.
Second, I would really enjoy having your opinion on how the Zettelkasten method is presented in the workshop. I believe that you all know much more about it that I do, along with having much more experience with it. Therefore, if you feel like I&#x27;ve missed some things, or if you think that it could be explained in a better way (since the workshop is designed for people that have never heard of it), I&#x27;d be delighted to hear it. You can share it here, or indicate it as an issue on the GitHub repository of the workshop.
I thank you all for all of your fascinating insights about the Zettelkasten method and your use of it; it has always been a pleasure to come here and read about your experience with it.
Have a nice day !</span>

                    <span>Hey, I&#x27;m using emacs and yasnippet and I have a problem. I created some snippets with some fields (with $0, $1 ect) so I can tab between them when completing them. But when I&#x27;m in a field, if I have for instance another snippet I want to use, I can&#x27;t use tab anymore to expand a key, when I press tab, it goes to the next field. How can I solve this problem? Is there a way to change the &quot;priority&quot; of tab? Or should I just change the key to go to the next field?

                    <span>Hi Emacsers! I&#x27;ve been using some variant of this code for several months (I started writing it quite soon after I began using Emacs) and have found it extremely useful. Maybe you will too. From the readme:
  
Aside is a package written with the aim of making it easy and convenient to use side windows for arbitrary sets of buffers. Specifically, Aside lets you specify a configuration for a window which determines which buffers are displayed in that window, where the window is located, specific customisations that window should have, and defines a ‘do-what-I-mean’ (DWIM) command for navigating to and toggling the visibility of the window, all in less than a dozen lines of code. Much of this flexibility springs directly from Emacs’ built-in ‘display-buffer-alist’ variable, however Aside can make it more convenient to define configurations for ‘display-buffer-alist’ that you can easily separate and use independently from one another, and Emacs does not come with any equivalent to the DWIM commands Aside can generate.
  
It comes with several pre-made configurations, each of which I use extensively myself. Those configurations set up dedicated windows for browsing projects in Dired, making a Vterm terminal always accessible, and ensuring help, search, and compiler warning buffers always show up in the same place. Some of the configurations are a single call to aside-define-configuration, but the Vterm and especially the Dired configuration are a bit more complex. Please try it out if it sounds useful and let me know what you think. If people find this layer of functionality on top of buffer-display-alist valuable, I&#x27;m thinking of asking to have it added to ELPA.

                    <span>Hi all!
 I have been working on PEL while learning Emacs, to help me remember commands, organize my Elisp code and to hopefully help new Emacs users get going. 
 It comes with extensive set of topic oriented PDF quickcards, a manual and code that loads (relatively) fast, with init.el and early-init templates, canned customization files; it controls features through customization. Once a feature is identified by customization it will download it, install it and provide key bindings. No Elisp code writing required by users. 
 PEL supports commands to activate package quickstart and implements a fast startup mode that extends package quickstart idea (by bundling packages into one mega package to reduce the load-path) but also available in Emacs 26. With it I have achieved 0.1 second startup for over 200 external packages (244 directories in load-path). More info on the Github page. I&#x27;ll be adding support for new packages. PEL won&#x27;t be for everyone but hopefully some people will find it useful. 
 Feedback welcome.
 Cheers :-)

                    <span>Hi, I always seem to run into snags when trying to do anything but the completely trivial with Haskell I/O. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 The problem is this: if I run a computation in a new thread, the memory used is never reclaimed/garbage collected. My test:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; module Main where
 import Control.Concurrent import System.Mem
 main &#x3D; do test performGC getLine
 test &#x3D; do _ &lt;- forkIO $ print $ foldr (+) 0 [1..5000000] print &quot;pre&quot; threadDelay (5*106) print &quot;post&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 While running this, I monitor the process&#x60; CPU and memory usage. It increases until the sum is printed and soon afterwards it prints &quot;post&quot;. Then, a GC should be performed, but the memory usage my system monitor reports never goes down.
 I figure I must be doing something weird, because I can&#x27;t imagine Haskell being what it is without reclaiming memory from finished threads. I hope someone can explain.
 Edit: using GHC 8.6.5

                    <span>Picking up Haskell for the first time and have been trying to set it up, albeit unsuccessfully, and was wondering if anyone has had these issues with Haskell before. I&#x27;ve never used VS Code before this so I&#x27;m already a bit overwhelmed with it. I&#x27;ve mostly been programming with IDEs from Jetbrains where they hold my hand through all the technical terminal stuff, so I&#x27;m not very well versed in this, but I&#x27;ll do my best to assist.
 I&#x27;m getting multiple errors with the Haskell extensions, the HLS support one, and Linter. 
 The Haskell (Project1) server crashed 5 times in the last 3 minutes. The server will not be restarted. (Source: Haskell (Extension))

 Cannot hlint the haskell file. The hlint program was not found. Use the &#x27;haskell.hlint.executablePath&#x27; setting to configure the location of &#x27;hlint&#x27;

                    <span>Hi all, this is a stupidly simple question but I was unable to find the solution.
 I feel I will facepalm when you tell me.
 For the record I am using Spacemacs, if it matters, but I am a beginner with both Spacemacs and Org.

                    <span>In this post, I’ll show how to build a Go project with Bazel,
using Gazelle to generate the build files.
Why Bazel?
With Bazel, I get incremental, reproducible, and cacheable builds.
It’s designed for large, polyglot monorepos
and can be extended to support more languages than the many already available.
Why Gazelle?
Gazelle looks at the Go source files and generates Bazel BUILD files for me.
I used tendermint
as an example Go project, because it’s large
enough to include several interesting problems:
protocol buffers
external dependencies
runtime dependencies
flaky and exclusive tests
How will we be able to tell when it’s finished?
At the end, we’ll be able to build targets for all of the Go sources,
$ bazel build //...

run tests,
$ bazel test //...

and execute the tendermint binary.

                    <span>The Collector&#x27;s Fallacy, which Christian Tietze has written about, is an example of the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma, also known as the multi-armed bandit problem.  From Wikipedia:

  
The multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (called &quot;exploration&quot;) and optimize their decisions based on existing knowledge (called &quot;exploitation&quot;). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize their total value over the period of time considered.


In the case of the Collector, the &quot;agent&quot; explores indefinitely and adds to their collection but postpones making the decision to do something with it. Wikipedia gives a list of practical applications of the multi-armed bandit problem, but I can&#x27;t resist pointing out that the problem of deciding which professor&#x27;s class to take is almost never counted among such lists, perhaps because professors compile them. Someone choosing among Zettelkasten implementations without really settling on one is another.
Given that the multi-armed bandit problem has a name, has been extensively studied since at least the middle of the twentieth century and has been solved in important cases, one question is whether some of these solutions could guide the Collector toward more productive uses of their time.</span>

I hope you can help me. When working on my zettelkasten, I want to link my new permanent notes to old permanent notes, whose number is growing over time, obviously. Because of this large number, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to find an existing permanent note to link with.

 [edit] Thanks everyone - the question was meant as a bit tongue in cheek, but I appreciate your candour and TIL it&#x27;s an error that makes sense in certain situations :)

                    <span>org-ref does this when exporting, but I would like to have this done in the orgmode file, ie. it looks like this:
 ​
  
Nullam tempus. Cras placerat accumsan nulla. [1] 
 .... 
 * Bibliography 
 [1] Smith B., Smith C. &#x27;et tu Brute?&#x27;, Journal of journalling, 2013, p. 213-34.
  
​
 Or, is there another setup that will do this other than org-ref? Thanks

                    <span>In github, you can link to an issue just by typing #500. Trac had similar auto-link types for linking to source code lines, issues, etc. 
 I&#x27;m thinking it would be great for my org-mode notes to have a similar auto-link functionality in org-mode so #500 auto-links to my issue 500. I&#x27;d be happy with a text replacement when typing, or dynamic auto-linking (regex triggering a function that returns the link URL). Is there such a thing?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using org-publish to turn my org-roam files into a website. Occasionally I&#x27;ll start a file and want to keep it around, but omit it from the publish. Drafts or stub files, for example.
 I know that in the org-publish-project-alist config I can specify files to exclude, but I&#x27;d like to do something within the file&#x27;s config itself.
 #+EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport and #+FILETAGS: :noexport: will omit all content under a heading (but not the content before all headings). The file will still publish, but be empty, which is less than desirable.
 Does anyone know an easy way to exclude files from publication without tinkering with the config?

                    <span>I&#x27;m struggling on a problem that I&#x27;ve boiled down to the following.
 I have a trait A with an abstract type param T and a couple concrete instances:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; sealed trait A { type T }
 object A { case object A1 extends A { type T &#x3D; Int } case object A2 extends A { type T &#x3D; String } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have another trait B with an abstract type param T and an apply method that takes an instance of T. 
  sealed trait B { type T def apply(t: T): Unit } 
 I&#x27;d like to make it so that I can use an instance of A to construct an instance of B such that their abstract type params are equivalent. Specifically, the following should compile:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; val a1b &#x3D; B(A.A1) a1b(99)
 val a2b &#x3D; B(A.A2) a2b(&quot;hello&quot;) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>My dissertation developed a method of specifying the complexity of finite automorphisms (functions from a set to itself). I&#x27;d like to extend this to relations (i.e., no restriction that a single arrow departs a particular domain element).
Working with math in my zettelkasten has been interesting. The only difficulty has been with diagrams etc.  I&#x27;ve found that working mainly physically and scanning the images and cleaning the text digitally has been a nice process without much overhead.
Proofs and particularly the elements of subproofs are natural since linking can double as both relation and implication; likewise examination of backlinks can be useful for examining assumptions / presuppositions.
In summary, its working reasonably well, I just need to work physically first, then transfer to digital.
Any shared experiences re mathematics research in your zettelkasten would be great.

                    <span>Anyone spotted usage or tried adding http://textbundle.org to Emacs/Org? Looks like a convenient archive for org (bundling text and images/assets). Could be handy in making org more portable (outside of Emacs)? There are lots of apps using it with markdown, but the spec seems friendly to other text markups like org?

                    <span>I feel a bit silly asking this because it&#x27;s probably right in front of me, but: is there a function like org-tag-view that doesn&#x27;t create a new buffer+window, but just returns the list of matching locations? (If not, it seems unfortunate to not have that functionality factored out).
 I&#x27;m returning to lisp after many years, and realizing just how nice it is in e.g. Haskell where you can search for a function signature! Any tips on how to find functionality when (it seems to me that) the APIs are just alphabetic lists of functions mixed with some fairly-reliable naming conventions?

                    <span>Both have slightly different semantics but are generally used for the same purpose; lazily chaining a bunch of map/filter/etc functions until a final terminal operation.
 Are there significant performance differences for either choice? Most of the time I can use .iterator but choose .view simply because it&#x27;s fewer characters.

                    <span>On the Scala website, I&#x27;m reading about futures and callbacks. (https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html#callbacks). Here, it mentions:
 In the event that some of the callbacks never complete (e.g. the callback contains an infinite loop), the other callbacks may not be executed at all. 
 I can&#x27;t think of a situation where the &quot;other callbacks&quot; wouldn&#x27;t get to run (unless the ExecutionContext is using just a single thread). Even if the never ending callback permanently &quot;occupies&quot; one thread, wouldn&#x27;t the other threads be able to pick up the other callbacks?
 In what case would a callback that never finishes (infinite loop) prevent other callbacks from ever running in a multithreaded environment?

                    <span>Hi, 
 ​
 Sorry if the post is an off-topic, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any information on whether the SonarCloud could support Scala 3. Currently it is giving me parsing errors on analysis and I cannot seem to find any information regarding the Scala 3 compatibility.

                    <span>I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to have a scheduled meeting marked as a recurring event in my agenda, and then to have notes for each instance of the meeting under that as a subtree.
 Basically, I have something like this:
 * My Meeting  
 And I want a way to turn it into
 * My Meeting  **  
 i.e. make a sub-tree for the (non-repeating) current instance of the meeting, in which I can take my notes, and bump the original (repeating) meeting&#x27;s date by a week (or whatever the repeat interval is).
 Abstractly, a repeating event is an infinite sequence of events. I want to split this into the first occurrence, and the rest of the sequence.
 I&#x27;ve seen that you can do C-c C-t to use org-todo to mark a recurring event as done, but that seems to create a list-item, not an entire sub-tree.
 Is this possible? Am I going about this in the wrong way?

                    <span>In an older version of The Archive, &#x27;Cntl+CMD+T&#x27; would switch between list types...One could highlight text and then the shortcut could number the list, or add dashes, or remove the list format altogether.  In the most recent update, this keyboard combo toggles typewriter mode on/off.
(I have an older version of The Archive on imac, and the newest version on laptop and noticed this.)
Any way we can bring this back?
Many thanks</span>

                    <span>Following @sfast &#x27;s advice on object tags, I&#x27;ve increasingly transitioned to using zettels as claims which connect two or more tag objects, and away from using zettels to refer to objects themselves. For instance, a zettel might express the following:

  
. #HumanBehavior is driven by #MentalModels, which are enacted through #EmbodiedCognition


Here, I&#x27;m using tags for objects, while the zettel itself embodies a specific claim. This practice has led to a proliferation of tags in my note system.
However, I don&#x27;t really like multi-word tags. And tagging seems like a distraction from a key human-focused aspect of intellectual work: naming things. &quot;Embodied Cognition&quot;, for example, is a term that has a specific meaning in a particular field; #EmbodiedCognition does not.

                    <span>Hi,
 I’m new to org mode. Is it possible to have multiple directories for org files and org-roam?
 I would like to have my personal org files and notes for org-roam synced with my private Dropbox and all work related org-files and org-roam notes synced with my work iCloud. 
 Can this be done and preferably in a way so that if I would exclude the work org file directory, all my personal notes and todos stay the same. 
 I know that I can define multiple paths for org-agenda-files but I’m unsure of org-roam files. 
 Best regards,
 David

                    <span>I am working on Vanilla Emacs. 
 org-superstar has this annoying thing where there are dots on the bullets.
 Org-Bullets is apparently legacy now so I was wondering if its still okay to use or if org-superstar is the better option. 
 Which one should I use?

                    <span>Daily ICFP
Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences.
Other posts in this series:
ICFP - Day 0
ICFP - Day 1
ICFP - Day 2
ICFP - Day 3
ICFP - Day 4
Day 5 - Friday
These notes follow Arnaud, Noon and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order. (The talks are not publicly posted at the time
of publication of this post, but we expect they will be over the
coming weeks.)
Arnaud — Parafuzz: Coverage-guided Property Fuzzing for Multicore OCaml programs: this is in the context of multicore OCaml (multicore OCaml has algebraic effects). The authors use algebraic effects to abstract over concurrency primitives, so that they can test concurrency property with the AFL fuzzer (AFL tries to generate random in…</span>

                    <span>A Zettelkasten may look something like the image above, where the arrows represent the direction of the links and the boxes a particular kind of Zettel..
Links aren&#x27;t always bidirectional. E.g.: Let&#x27;s say I have an overview Zettel on Maria Popova&#x27;s note-taking method. From this Zettel, I may link to a Zettel explaining how she uses sticky tab notes. But, the latter Zettel might not link to the former.
Another thing to note is that the item in the bottom of the image may link to further details. This might happen when you break down a Zettel that violates the Principle of Atomicity. E.g.:
Topic-based overview: &quot;Maria Popova&#x27;s note-taking system.&quot;
Idea relevant to the overview: &quot;Idea index definition.&quot;
A detail of the idea: &quot;Reading is about identifying patterns.&quot;
A detail of the detail: &quot;Pattern definition.&quot;
I based my diagram on what&#x27;s been discussed in the Zettelkasten blog, so others&#x27; Zettelkasten might look different.
Questions for the reader:
What would you change of my diagram?
How does your Zettelkasten look like?</span>

                    <span>Hi!
I&#x27;m an 20-year-old female. I have a bunch of mental issues that are either inherent or results of life experience. I love reading - the only thing that keeps me from continuing to read is mental fatigue, lack of sleep. To me reading is a way of escape.
When I acquire new knowledge, I find myself a little more free from all the mental stuff. Sometimes I find myself doing things in slow motion because my brain is reserving energy for processing information.
However I&#x27;m not so happy with the amount of info I retain so I have been looking for a way to take better notes and Zettelkasten sounds like what I need! I have been reading about it yesterday evening but I&#x27;m still not able to fully grasp this method (I find myself in slow motion again).
But anyways, nice to meet you, everyone!</span>

Noon — Second to last day of ICFP. I’m becoming sad that it’s
going to be over! But that said, I’m really looking forward to today!
I feel a bit relaxed as well, because from my timezone (UK) I get a bit

I am a musicologist who have been reading the blog- and forumposts for some years now. 
I use plain text and search
I don´t agree with the notion of a &quot;second brain&quot;, but lean more towards the notion of a &quot;extended mind&quot;.
Thank you for all your insights and looking forward to take part in the discussions!

Noon — On Continuation-Passing Transformations and Expected Cost Analysis
Discussion of the difficulty of costing probabilistic algorithms (i.e. you don’t know what it will do.)
Turns out using continuations makes it a bit easier to reason about (I didn’t quite follow the trick that makes it true),
But, it gives a way to think compute average-cost analysis, which seems pretty useful!

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious if anyone has experience with a dual-zettelkasten format.  So far, it hasn&#x27;t caused any (major) problems.
If I write a &quot;good&quot; zettle diligently and feel too lazy to rewrite the full note in digital form, particularly a note with lots of diagrams (mathematics, etc) I&#x27;ll resort to the following...
Workflow: Physical to Digital
Scan the zettle making sure its readable
Create a zettle with the same id and title in digital form
Insert the scan as a large image
Write the header in digital form (using a physical-scan-template) this is quick
Write any links in digital form
Write a one-sentence summary in digital form.
Liberally use NON-hashed tags for keywords in the scanned text for easy searching.
Keep the physical copy and add to physical slipbox
At some point, if I get around to it, I will slowly convert notes that have been post-semi-digitized per the above into purely digital form.
I find the above most helpful when doing mathematics: the diagrams of category theory can take lots of time to write in latex. So if you have a particularly well-formed note with lots of notation, then I&#x27;ve found this method can work out fine in the short-term.  The most important items -- by trial and error -- from above are 5 6 and 7 so as to preserve the ability to search, link, and see a short summary.
Workflow: Digital to Physical (perhaps this is a bit obsessive)
At the end of each day collect the digitally created zettels from that day (easy with timestamp ID)
Print them out 2-per page and cut in half
Add to physical slipbox
Always maintain a printed copy of any index or structure notes.
Now you have a synchronized digital and physical slipbox. Its not perfect but sometimes the good enough, is.</span>

                    <span>As many of you know I am new to Zettelkasten.
I&#x27;m curious how the interplay between sparing use of folders and &quot;types&quot; (a finite small set of tags on the form) -- for example, when taking notes on a book I consider this a buffer note (I use the haskell type syntax ::buffer ) and place it in my /fleeting notes folder. Fleeting contains anything from ::buffer notes to extracted highlights, to temporary documents etc.
This might become a ::literature note if the ideas in the ::buffer note are reworked to be my own (personal reactions -- things it reminds me of etc)
Finally a literature note becomes ::permanent (and goes in the /zettelkasten folder) when I have massaged it (into one or more) atomic, conceptual, not directly derivative -- but still, of course, referenced and possibly linked to …</span>

by Conal Elliott. Conal’s papers and talks are always
very insightful — because they are always very simple. Conal has a
remarkable knack for taking problems that seem complex and reducing them to
their essence — often, a simple compositional language. This work fits very
much in this vein, describing how we can derive parsers for a language

Richard — Calculating Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional
Pearl)
Started my day at 6:30am in order to attend the Q&amp;A for Calculating
Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional Pearl), by Mitchell Pickard and
Graham Hutton, of the University of Nottingham. (I watched the video itself
last night.) This is a very cool paper about a technique for deriving a
proved-correct compiler by construction. The main example in the talk was
about compiling a simple expre…</span>

Noon
This is my first day ever at ICFP! I’m just trying to get the hang of
the platform, the topics, what background knowledge I’m expected to have, and

Noon — Higher-order Programming with Effects and Handlers by Jonathan Immanuel Brachthäuser
