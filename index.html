                              <span>Emacs just crashed on me 3 times in the span of 10 minutes for no apparent reason. I had sly open and I was editing a lisp file and then the emacs window just closed. When I launched emacs from a terminal all I got as an error was &#x60; Job 1, &#x27;emacs &amp;&#x27; terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)&#x60;. I installed Fedora last night so I doubt there is anything on my system that I could have added to might be causing this problem. Since I am running sway, I do not have the .xsession-errors file. Journalctl just says &#x60;Jul 07 13:50:59 zenbook systemd-coredump[14384]: Process 2164 (emacs) of user 1000 terminated abnormally without generating a coredump.&#x60; How can I debug this?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to write an LSP server for a project which uses json files. First thing I am doing is parsing the JSON files and validating the syntax. Something strange is happening with the published diagnostics. Eglot is showing the actual position of the diagnostic 1 line after and 1 character before the actual reported location of the error. Here&#x27;s a screenshot of the file as well as the message from the server. The error is because the 2nd line is missing a comma. As can be seen in the event log, the server is publishing the right location for the error, which is line 3 character 4. But the error actually shows up in line 4 character 3. Other language server work just fine with my emacs so it is likely that I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Is this because of a mismatch of 1-based and 0-based indexing between the server and the client? Is there a setting that I need to tweak? I took a cursory look at the LSP spec but couldn&#x27;t find anything about negotiation of indexing. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 in the Gnus summary buffer I customized the threading appearance:
  (setq-default gnus-sum-thread-tree-leaf-with-other &quot;├── &quot; gnus-sum-thread-tree-single-leaf &quot;└── &quot; gnus-sum-thread-tree-vertical &quot;│ &quot;) 
 When I&#x27;m reading my mail or mailing lists like emacs-devel via news.gmane.io it works as expected.
 Expected behaviour looks something like this as opposed to the default behaviour.
 Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get this to work in nnhackernews and nnreddit written by u/nnreddit-user.
 There threads just get indented by whitespace.
 Does anyone how what I am missing here?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi guys, i want to start a side project and Scala is my Swiss Knife for almost everything, i want to create a crud app as fast as possible.
 The main problem that i found with Cats Effect / ZIO libraries is that those are only the &quot;effect libraries&quot;, if you want to do something you have to build it, i ended up building my own &quot;micro-frameworks&quot; for every (professional or hobby) project that i start and most of them are almost the same.
 Any good template or unknown framework suggestion is great!.
 PD: I want to do a Web Application, i already have the Tyrian app working for my front/mobile app but i&#x27;m okay working with templates too.

 The type definition seems a valid but I cannot fit any function to bar(...) as shown above. Is there any function that can satisfy the function bar(...) or I just made a bad Bar type definition even though it compiles? Thanks

 Hello! I&#x27;m trying to get this repository to work on Mac OS and I&#x27;d like some help!
 The setup is that there is a C++ library with a C interface. It needs to link to the WebKit framework.
 I have made a haskell library which is bindings for the c++ library. In the cabal file, I reference that it needs the WebKit framework.
 The executable depends on the library, but the executable (or the library) does not seem to link to WebKit. As a result the executable breaks.
 Is this a bug in cabal/haskell? Does anyone know how to fix it?
 Thanks :)

 Please test it and let us know at the Stack repository if you run into any trouble. If all goes well, we hope to release the final version in a couple of weeks.
 Release notes:
  
The change in major version from 2.x to 3.1 marks the dropping of support for versions of GHC before 8.4, deprecated in Stack 2.15.1.
  
Changes since v2.15.7:
 Behavior changes:
  
Stack uses the version of the Cabal package that comes with the specified version of GHC. Stack no longer supports such Cabal versions before 2.2, which came with versions of GHC before 8.4. Consequently, the init command will not try LTS Haskell before 12.0.

                              <span>I use emacs eat with my zsh shell (I compiled the terminfo for eat using eat-compile-terminfo on my machine to get it working). However, when I ssh into another machine which has a bash shell, it seems that nothing works (I cannot delete text on the prompt, autocomplete doesn&#x27;t work, etc...). 
 Can eat be used with ssh? If so, how can I fix this issue?

                              <span>I have tons of bookmarks. Many in folders and subfolders. I&#x27;d like to export them to an HTML file, and then drop that into an org-mode file, the bookmark folders becoming subtrees, and the individual bookmarks in bullet points. What are some ways I could do this?

                              <span>for convenience i have these options set:
 &#x27;(tags-add-tables t) &#x27;(tags-revert-without-query t) &#x27;(imenu-auto-rescan t) 
 What&#x27;s really annoying to me is when i regenerate tags table (for example i edit source code to add new functions and run this command ctags -e --languages&#x3D;c++,c --c-kinds&#x3D;+p -R .) 
 imenu ui updates itself perfectly well, and gets populated with new tag candidates automatically, meanwhile any xref command doesn&#x27;t get updated, so i have to M-x visit-tags-table each time i want to update it / get new tag candidates.
 Tested on Emacs 31.0.50, 29.4, and emacs -q with same results.
 Should i report a this as a bug or am i missing some option?

                              <span>I recently moved to emacs 31 and noticed a substantial increase in memory usage. This is the first time I&#x27;ve come across something that I can conclusively say is not a problem with my system. Is this the kind of thing the emacs devs might be interested in as a bug report? 31 is clearly in the beginning stages of development and I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfect. I get very little chance to contribute to the community of people that produce one of my favorite programs and was wondering if this feedback would be of use.Apart from the Emacs bug checklist and the emacs wiki memory leaks page, is there anyplace I can look to as a way to gather information to help with development?

 I just had a problem where updating the global ESLint binary used with my editors caused no more linting, unless my project was on the specific newer version 9.x.x.
 I took inspiration on some old hacks I found (but none of they worked with me) to patch my on way to force flymake-eslint to use the LOCAL project eslint instead of the global one.
 If it is of any help I made this blog post explaining how to achieve this: https://www.rahuljuliato.com/posts/eslint-on-emacs

                              <span>I&#x27;m going through the Advent of Code 2023 problems to get back into Haskell. For the second part of day 4, I&#x27;m using an STUArray to keep track of the ticket counts, and I want at least version 0.5.6 of the array package so I can use modifyArray&#x27;. However, when I try to build my solution, cabal is not able to resolve the dependencies (error message below). I know that cabal caches packages globally, and this caching seems to be the source of the issue. For example, the error message is saying that the deepseq-1.4.8.0 requires array&#x3D;&#x3D;0.5.4.0, while the Hackage page says that it simply requires array &gt;&#x3D;0.4 &amp;&amp; &lt;0.6. I&#x27;m guessing this is because the cached version was built specifically with array-0.5.4.0, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to fix this error. Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a late stage phd student in physics data analysis, doing some light numerical computation (mostly linear algebra, stats), training models with pytorch, and plotting various relevant combinations. I have made several bugs related to using numpy arrays incorrectly and modifying them inplace only to realize much later and fix them with hundreds of .copy() making everything ugly.
 I am interested in haskell to avoid making several objects, their interfaces, when in reality I can clearly see that my research is several composed functions of data. All the while ensuring that my data doesn&#x27;t need .copy() everytime when handing over arrays from one class to another.
 I have some questions mainly regarding the current state of the libraries:
 1. is it easy/possible to natively think about xarray - n-dimensional arrays like numpy with named dimensions like pandas (essentially pandas multi-index) in haskell?
 2. is it easy/possible to achieve the various plotting routines in matplotlib, but mainly imshow, scatter, histogram2d, natively in haskell?
 3. Is it easy/possible to train pytorch models natively in haskell? 
 I imagine needing O(~months) to get up to speed and I would appreciate if that sunk time would be worth the benefits soon after.
 Optionally, I would also like to hear about your success stories in switching to haskell even if vaguely related to these ideas.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been trying to make a program which can compress a string using Huffman encoding, where encoding returns you the mapping of character to its code, and the encoded string
 I&#x27;m now trying to write a short IO loop where you can enter text to be either encoded or decoded, but I&#x27;m not sure how i can &#x27;save&#x27; my mapping [(Letter,[Int])] to be carried over for decoding later (or if this even possible / normal in Haskell).
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to be able to save it somewhere so I have a loop like 
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;would you like encoding/decoding&quot; c  encodeLoop &gt;&gt; main &quot;D&quot; -&gt; decodeLoop &gt;&gt; main _ -&gt; putStrLn &quot;Character not recognised, please try again&quot; &gt;&gt; main 
 and then after encoding, I could store the mapping created, and later on pass it to the decoder to use.
 If there is a better / more Haskelly way of doing this I&#x27;d be really glad to hear it 
 Thanks in advance

 I have installed Haskell via ghcup and created a new project with stack new project-name
 If I want to run stack build stack ALWAYS wants to install GHC 9.6.6, no matter which version I have installed and set in GHCup. And I activated the &quot;better GHCup integration for stack&quot; while the installation.
 I don&#x27;t know why stack always wants to use GHC 9.6.6
 EDIT: I currently try to install the lastest versions of stack, cabal and HLS and set GHC 9.6.6 and try it again.
 With GHC 9.6.6 and the latest versions of the other tools it seems to work now

 Simple question: why?
 And more important: it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I can&#x27;t attache a screenshot, but I have several notifications like &quot;Processing 1/2&quot;, &quot;Formatting Main.hs&quot; or &quot;Saving &#x27;Main.hs&#x27;: The Formatter &quot;Haskell&quot; is executed&quot; after I tried just to save the file.

                              <span>Does anyone have advice on the best library for loading images from image files and processing them? The two options I&#x27;ve come across for loading images from files (for example, jpg files) are Juicy Pixels and Friday, more specifically, friday-devil. The issues are:
 1) Juicy Pixels can load images, but it seems to be quite slow. Loading an image representation from a jpg file runs substantially slower than doing the same thing in other compiled languages, like Go and Nim.
 2) Friday seems pretty far out-of-date, and I run into dependency conflicts when I try to use friday-devil.
 Can anyone suggest alternate possibilities? Or is there something more I could do with Juicy Pixels, to run it more efficiently? I tried adding ghc-options: -O2 in the executable stanza of my cabal file, but this didn&#x27;t have any discernible effect.
 To further complicate things, ideally I&#x27;d like to find a solution that allows compiling the program as a static binary. I dunno if that will be an option if I use a solution (or develop my own) based on a C library.
 Thanks for any suggestions.

                              <span>Hi,
 Up until now, I extensively run (C-c C-c) code blocks in multiple org files, mainly for data fetching, cleaning, processing and in the end, the resulting data is exported to some other format (csv, spreadsheet, database, ...). Using orgmode for self documenting and structuring these blocks is wonderful. I can organize each block by its functionality, by client, etc, and also add some usage tips, or other useful info.
 These seems manageable when these blocks are simple, and just a couple of lines. But when they get bigger, and/or require other code from other blocks, it gets harder to maintain.
 For example, block A needs a function from block B, which in turn needs a class from block X and a function from block Y. I could solve with noweb references, but in terms of manageability is …</span>

 I would love to use emacs and orgmode (have been hearing about it&#x27;s capabilities for years) but this whole thing becomes moot for me if I can&#x27;t sync a todo list on several devices and computers.
  
Is it doable in a way that won&#x27;t make me feel like tearing my hair out?
 Bonus question: is there anyway to put simple password protection or encryption on the synced file? 
  
Thanks!

                              <span>I wanted to make eldoc-box frames transparent so that the code in main frame shines though it. I tried adding eldoc-box-frame-hook and setting (set-frame-parameter nil &#x27;alpha-background 80) in it. This indeed makes the child frame transparent, but not in a way I intended. Instead of seeing main frame through it, I see my desktop background. I wonder if this is even supported or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I&#x27;m in KDE plasma waylaynd and I have built emacs (couple days ago) from sources without PGTK (because with PGTK was very slow in my setup).
 I don&#x27;t even know if I actually want it transparent but now it bugs me a lot because I was not able to try it out :)

 This morning I was doing some config-file cleanup and re-discovered the fact that it supports the use of a &quot;bitmap&quot; for your indentation guide.
 Have any of you folks done something cool with that? The example of creating a subtle vertical dotted line is cool, but surely someone&#x27;s had a &quot;hold my beer&quot; moment and done something kind-of outrageous with this. 
 If it was you, I totally want to see.

                              <span>I have been trying to override a function, but only for a project under projectile control.
 So far I&#x27;ve been using (or rather trying to), dir-locals, but it does not play well with function overriding.
 Is this even possible, or am I missing something?

                              <span>Has anyone tried using emacs remotely with waypipe?
 I just tried here and I am impressed on how faster compared to ssh -X.
 I have some problems when running emacs directly waypipe ssh $remote emacs. If I run a terminal waypipe ssh $remote alacritty and then open emacs GUI, it works better (at least, I have not found major problems).

                              <span>Just installed GNU Emacs an I am working my way through the manual. I thought it was a lightweight text editor, but I just found out that it has: games, lsp support, version control, mail(??), news, and a fucking psychotherapist. I&#x27;m starting to reconsider my usage of Emacs. This seems extremely bloated.
 Additionally, the Emacs manual itself is massive. I&#x27;m starting to question if this is worth reading.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a custom minibuffer, but I can&#x27;t find a way to change its major or minor modes. How can I do this?
 &quot;minibuffer-with-setup-hook&quot; runs the function before the buffer is active so it&#x27;s not possible to just &quot;setq major-mode&quot; inside of it.
 EDIT: I guess just changing the keymap temporarily will do the trick, since I just need the arrow keys to move the cursor in another window.

                              <span>I know it sounds cryptic but I just happen to want to type Cyrillic on a spanish layout keyboard. I am able to do so by using this:
  (require &#x27;quail) ;; Define a custom keyboard layout (setq quail-keyboard-layout-es &quot;\ \ ºª1!2\&quot;3·4$5%6&amp;7/8(9)0&#x3D;&#x27;?¡¿ \ qQwWeErRtTyYuUiIoOpP&#x60;^+* \ aAsSdDfFgGhHjJkKlLñÑ´¨çÇ \ zZxXcCvVbBnNmM,;.:-_ \ &quot; ) (add-to-list &#x27;quail-keyboard-layout-alist &#x60;(&quot;pc105-es&quot; . ,quail-keyboard-layout-es)) (quail-set-keyboard-layout &quot;pc105-es&quot;) (add-hook &#x27;after-change-major-mode-hook (lambda () (unless (or (minibufferp) (member (buffer-name) &#x27;(&quot;*scratch*&quot; &quot;*Messages*&quot; &quot;*Help*&quot;)) (derived-mode-p &#x27;shell-mode &#x27;eshell-mode &#x27;term-mode &#x27;dired-mode)) (set-input-method &quot;russian-computer&quot;)))) 
 The problem is that characters &#x60;^ which should print cyrillic letter х and characters ´¨ which should print cyrillic character э are compound -&gt; which means they are used for vocals like àâ áä through the use of use of dead keys (keys which are used to modify other characters and print not by themselves unless typed twice), however I&#x27;m into the problem that despite creating my own keyboard layout emacs still makes me type those dead characters twice and its annoying.
 Do you know how can I deactivate this behaviour?

                              <span>Hello!
 I’m making a library and executable and having a tough time!
 In my library I have: ~~~ frameworks: WebKit ~~~ But the final executable that links to the library doesn’t link to WebKit. Is this a bug? Or am I doing something wrong?
 I’ve tried adding the framework to the executable as well, but it still won’t show up in otool.
 Edit: To further explain the situation. I have a c++ library (the source, I’m not linking to it) which presents a c interface which I add using cxx-sources in the cabal file. This uses the WebKit framework on Mac OS. I then have a hsc file which exposes the c functions to Haskell.
 I then use this Haskell library and it crashes because the framework isn’t linked.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to add LaTex support for my blog. I started out with this template which uses slick as opposed to Hakyll since it seemed less daunting. After looking through the codebase, I realised that I needed to modify the mdtoHTML function in app/Main.hs by adding writerExtensions which I found here to render the LaTex in the Markdown. This is the function after I&#x27;ve made my modifications:
 mdToHTML :: T.Text -&gt; Action Value mdToHTML &#x3D; markdownToHTMLWithOpts markdownOptions htmlOptions where markdownOptions :: ReaderOptions markdownOptions &#x3D; def { readerExtensions &#x3D; fold [ extensionsFromList [ Ext_yaml_metadata_block , Ext_fenced_code_attributes , Ext_auto_identifiers , Ext_footnotes , Ext_link_attributes , Ext_pipe_tables ] , githubMarkdownExtensions ] } htmlOptions &#x3D; def { writerExtensions &#x3D; fold [ extensionsFromList [ Ext_tex_math_dollars , Ext_tex_math_single_backslash , Ext_latex_macros , Ext_fenced_code_blocks , Ext_backtick_code_blocks , Ext_fenced_code_attributes ] ] } 
 However, after building and running the site, I noticed that anything enclosed in $..$, $$...$$ and \[...\] still down get rendered at all. I&#x27;m not sure what to do. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s define a simple record:
 data R &#x3D; R { r :: Bool } 
 Now, with DataKinds and KindSignatures on, we can attempt to use it like this:
 data X (r :: R) &#x3D; X type XR1 &#x3D; X (&#x27;R True) type XR2 &#x3D; X (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) 
 The definition of XR1 compiles without issues, but XR2 gives an error:
 app/Main.hs:12:22: error: parse error on input ‘&#x3D;’ | 12 | type XR2 &#x3D; X (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) | ^ 
 Something very similar happens when we try to pattern match at the type level. With TypeFamilies enabled:
 type family F (r :: R) where F (&#x27;R True) &#x3D; () F (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) &#x3D; () 
 The first equation works fine, but the second one results in an identical error message:
 app/Main.hs:16:15: error: parse error on input ‘&#x3D;’ | 16 | F (&#x27;R { r &#x3D; True }) &#x3D; () | ^ 
 One final example (the error is still the same):
 type R1 &#x3D; &#x27;R True -- Ok type R2 &#x3D; &#x27;R { r &#x3D; True } -- Error 
 What is going on here? When using records as values, the two ways to construct and pattern match on records are equivalent (as far as I know). Why are they treated so differently when used at the type level?

                              <span>Hello. I am having issues with my parser combinators in this code: https://play.haskell.org/saved/WQpzwZAM (You can change the input binding to test out the parser) The issue is that I am unable to parse function application: when appP&#x27;s left is defined like left  parseTest (exprP  x + 1 in x 1&quot; 1:26: | 1 | let x &#x3D; \x -&gt; x + 1 in x 1 | ^ unexpected &#x27;1&#x27; expecting end of input, symbol, or white space  I believe the issue here is that left  varP, but it errors in a different place here: hs ghci&gt; parseTest (exprP  x + 1 in x 1&quot; 1:17: | 1 | let x &#x3D; \x -&gt; x + 1 in x 1 | ^^^^^ unexpected &quot;+ 1 i&quot; expecting &quot;false&quot;, &quot;let&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;(&#x27;, &#x27;\&#x27;, alphanumeric character, integer, or white space  Seemingly because it parses x + 1 as an application, and it doesn&#x27;t let the exprP do it&#x27;s job of parsing operators? So I had the thought process of &quot;maybe, if I make valP do ...  try appP  ... instead of ...  appP  ... so that it backtracks, exprP would get to the binary operators before appP,&quot; and I tried to change the code for that, but I think that&#x27;s a dead end.

 We are trying to better understand what things are causing the most pain for long term maintenance of applications built with Scala and to this end I&#x27;ve started a poll on Twitter/X at
 https://x.com/lukasz_bialy/status/1808807669517402398
 It would be awesome if you could vote there but if you have no such possibility, a comment here on reddit would be very helpful too. The purpose of this is for the Scala team at VirtusLab to understand where we should direct our focus and to figure out better ways to help companies that feel &quot;stuck&quot; with Scala-based services or data pipelines that pose a problem from maintenance perspective. If you have some horror stories about maintenance of Scala projects, feel free to share them too!

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m getting to know Quill and while I like its concepts and what it offers in comparison with other JDBC libraries, I&#x27;m still trying to assess its limitations. The documentation is very short and to be honest i feel like it doesn&#x27;t cover even half of questions one can have while learning the library. There are only few examples for the most basic cases, then when it comes to the Contexts section there are almost none. I have no idea when to use &quot;lazy val ctx &#x3D; new PostgresJdbcContext(SnakeCase, &quot;ctx&quot;)&quot; and when to simply use &quot;quill: Quill.Postgres[SnakeCase]&quot; from the Getting Started section.
 There are 6 JDBC dialects provided by the library - H2Dialect, MySQLDialect, PostgresDialect, SqliteDialect, SQLServerDialect, OracleDialect. I wanted to ask if Quill can also be used for other databases maybe for some more generic queries, or is it better to choose a different tool for other RDB?

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is a report on why I&#x27;m here and this week&#x27;s ZK work themes/ideas:
First, learning how to discuss an idea has been gratifying through the forum discussion Discourse graph and Zettelkasten. It&#x27;s been a masterclass on capturing creative ideation. This reminds me of when Mortimer Adler argued that speed reading is flawed; true comprehension requ…</span>

 Neovim has this nifty feature by default that when a region/line is copied, it temporarily flashes to notify the user the exact region being copied.
 Is there a way to do this in emacs? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for about half a year now, and my feeling is that Emacs is the most flexible and powerful editor I&#x27;ve ever used. I think I won&#x27;t need to try any other editors for at least the next 5 years.
 Previously I was using Sublime Text, the shortcut design of it felt very smooth and responsive, I even wrote many plugins for it. But as my customization requirements for editing became more and more personalized, I felt it was time to try other editors. Then, I had to choose between the Vim family and Emacs, and ultimately chose to systematically learn Emacs because I wanted to try Org-Mode.
 Emacs has satisfied my biggest requirements for an editor:
  
100% configurable (built-in customization system, Elisp...)
 Visibility. In Emacs, you can even see all the information (UTF-8 e…</span>

                              <span>Pretty much the above question. I am using Emacs 30, mainly to use the built-in which-key-mode and use-package with VC. So far, I have had no problems with them. But I was trying to install doom-themes from GitHub, and now for lisp-dirs, I think I have to include both &quot;extensions&quot; and &quot;themes&quot;, at least that&#x27;s the impression I got from downloading the tar file from melpa. So far, I have done this:
 (use-package doom-themes ;; :vc (:url &quot;https://github.com/doomemacs/themes&quot; ;; :lisp-dir &quot;themes/&quot; ;; :lisp-dir &quot;extensions/&quot;) :config (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t) (load-theme &#x27;doom-solarized-light t)) 
 but, it didn&#x27;t work. How do I include both the directories? (and yes, I am a newbie)

Also I went through similar posts on this subreddit once again, searched for solution on search engines, there a lot of tricks/tweaks and &quot;solutions&quot;, but I found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OSv5JCIlPZA and this repo of the same author https://github.com/amosbird/emacs/tree/onemodeline . May be it is possible to merge this to the official emacs repo?

I&#x27;m using the sourceforge builds of Emacs 30 native Android port. However, I&#x27;m struggling to get a nerd font going. Various fancy icons just don&#x27;t display properly, outside doom-modeline which uses nerd-icons, leaving org-mode, eshell et al without their usual bling.

 What am I missing?

I&#x27;d like to have the subdirectory corresponding to the day&#x27;s date to be added as a bookmark (I am using bookmark-plus), but this must be updated everyday. - the new bookmark must be created and the old one must be removed.
 I am no dev, I tried to have something created with the help of Chatgpt... but it does not work. 
 A first bookmark was created, but the day after I received an error message (and the same everyday since then): &quot;No such bookmark in bookmark list &#x27;tmp-2024-07-04&#x27;&quot;
 here is the code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;bookmark) (require &#x27;time-date) 
 (defun my-create-date-based-bookmark () &quot;Create a bookmark for the current date&#x27;s directory and remove old date-based bookmarks.&quot; (interactive) (let* ((base-dir &quot;~/tmp/&quot;) (date-str (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)) (date-dir (concat base-dir date-str)) (bookmark-name (concat &quot;tmp-&quot; date-str))) 
  ;; Ensure the directory exists (unless (file-directory-p date-dir) (make-directory date-dir t)) 
  ;; Add the new bookmark 
  (bookmark-set date-dir bookmark-name) (bookmark-prop-set bookmark-name &#x27;filename date-dir) 
  ;; Remove old bookmarks matching the pattern (dolist (bm bookmark-alist) (let ((bm-name (car bm))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 can someone help me with this function? thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve looked around but I can&#x27;t quite find a good guide to haskell for people with a background in agda. Forgive me if I missed something.
 I am very familiar with using agda as a proof assistant, but haven&#x27;t used it too much as a programming language. I am interested in learning more about using agda as a programming language. A (somewhat distant goal) is being able to solve advent of code problems in agda.
 But, agda doesn&#x27;t have that many existing libraries. So I&#x27;d like to learn haskell to get the feel for how one should write programs in a functional language. I figure learning haskell is useful for other reasons as well. So I want to give it an honest go. I&#x27;d like to be able to solve some advent of code problems in haskell.
 Does anybody know a good introduction to haskell for someone fairly familiar with agda, but who has only used agda for formal verification? I am very familiar with the lambda calculus and type systems, algebraic data type, inductive types, and pattern matching, etc. I mostly need a crash course in syntax, important functions, input and output, and whatever else I might be missing from the agda proof assistant side of things.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with a parser exercise to try to understand applicatives and how they can be used to compose parsing functions together. I have a basic Parser type like this: (Full code Replit here)
 newtype Parser a &#x3D; Parser {runParser :: String -&gt; Either (String, Int) (a, String, Int)}
 The left side is a failure with the error message and char position, and the right side is a success with the value, the remaining string, and the char position.
 I made an Applicative instance for my parser type so that it would compose together and keep track of the char position in the original text as it moves along.
 instance Applicative Parser where pure :: a -&gt; Parser a pure a &#x3D; Parser g where g xs &#x3D; Right (a, xs, 0) () :: Parser (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser b (Parser rp1)  (Parser rp2) &#x3D; Parser f where f xs &#x3D; case rp1 xs of Left (err, i) -&gt; Left (err, i) Right (pf, s&#x27;, i) -&gt; g s&#x27; where g xs&#x27; &#x3D; case rp2 xs&#x27; of Left (err, pos) -&gt; Left (err, pos + i) Right (val, l, pos) -&gt; Right (pf val, l, pos + i) 
 My problem is that the char position seems to work fine with single-level S-expressions:
 https://preview.redd.it/a2nipo5v8iad1.png?width&#x3D;431&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;7bf1c9ccdbaa1038455de9a75e281a19da4bb812
 This wordks and it is exactly what I want it to do.
 But it does not work with embedded S-expressions! It just shows the error at the beginning of first embedding of an S-expression.

 The rest of the code can be found on this Replit link. Can anyone take a look at this code and help me out on my learning journey? Thanks so much!

 I have created an eDSL for the SMTLib 2.6 standard.
 It&#x27;s very much like ekmett/ersatz for QSAT.
 Features a strongly typed and clean API with pure formula construction.
 If you are into SMT, it&#x27;s worth a look!

                              <span>Hello, I have recently switched to Emacs (&amp; Org-Mode, probably not an uncommon sentence ya&#x27;ll have heard :)) specifically for doing writing (non fiction &amp; fiction.) Almost all of my use-cases work perfectly with the export: &#x3D;C-c C-e l p&#x3D; and I&#x27;m done. However, sometimes I am in need of just raw regular ascii text of the content.
 Here&#x27;s the problem: I write using semantic line breaks, Headers, annotations with comments, etc. All the good org-mode stuff. So I just export it to ascii instead of trying to copy from the buffer. Unfortunately, in ascii export it breaks off each line at 72 characters.
 Now, I know there is a variable (org-ascii-text-width) but I tried setting it to a very large value and it just breaks. I can&#x27;t adjust this value per export. Is there any way I can just turn off the hard-line wrapping feature of the ascii export? 
 Sorry for the long-winded explanation of a very simple problem, but after awhile searching I haven&#x27;t found a very satisfactory answer (besides a mailing list response of &#x27;No you can&#x27;t, just write an elisp macro to undo it.)

                              <span>Hello All,
 I&#x27;m using the csl processor for my LaTeX export, which I think means that I&#x27;m using citeproc-el.
 Up until recently, this worked nicely for me. After an update, however, I&#x27;m getting some results and functionality that I don&#x27;t prefer.
 What I&#x27;d like is simple and unlinked LaTeX like this:
 \footnote{Robert W. Snyder, \textit{The Voice of the City: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York} (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 12.}
 Instead, I&#x27;m now getting a much more complex output, which uses a &quot;\cslbibitem&quot; command defined in the preamble:
 \footnote{\cslbibitem{520}{Robert W. Snyder, \textit{The Voice of the City: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York} (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 12}.
 How do I get the simpler output?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>Hey,
 So I come from experience in .NET and I&#x27;m trying to learn Scala and functional programming paradigm. I got very interesting because it sounded completely different from OOP and maybe knowing both could enhance my skill set and problem solving.
 Anyway, I started learning, and immediately hit the wall with all 3rd party libraries and understanding what is useful, what is not. What libraries I should learn, which I should not. Seems that Scala without Cats is not pure FP. There is a akka library, which is so big and heavy, that I even consider If I want to touch that.
 In .NET you kinda have everything out of the box, most of the thing you want to achieve, you can by using standart library. And in Scala, seems that standart library is minimal on purpose.
 I would like to ask if anyone could share some tips or steps in understanding what should I learn in Scala. What are you actually using in your work environment. In real life scenarios.
 I feel like choice fatigue is starting to settle in me.

Announcing Haddock Dingus, a tool for previewing Haddock markup by Taylor Fausak
I’ve often wanted a web-based tool for previewing what some Haddock will look like. Over the weekend I put one together. I call it the Haddock Dingus, after the original Markdown Dingus. It’s pretty simple: Input some Haddock, click “Submit”, and see what the output HTML looks like. Give it a whirl and let me know what you think!

While react-native-svg has served React Native developers well for basic vector graphics, it often falls short when it comes to replicating the more complex effects seen in web applications. We’ll be integrating Skia for rendering sharp, efficient 2D graphics and Reanimated for creating fluid, responsive animations. Step-by-step, we’ll explore the setup, key coding techniques, and best practices to implement a dynamic image slider that is both smooth and visually stunning.

                              <span>Has anyone tried using org-roam with git branches? I was worried about messing up my main base, but I want to use org-roam-node-find when I&#x27;m doing new research, both on old notes, and hot fresh new notes I just wrote down. I did it unprotected(no versioning or backup) sometimes ago and fucked that notebase up pretty bad that I abondanded it shortly after.
 I was thinking about writing a package specifically for this: creating a new org-roam-directory and combine search result of org-roam-node-find of the main one and the new one, but later I find out I would eventually want to merge the new one into the old one, which make it looks teriblly like a git dev branch.
 So my questions is has anyone tried something like this, to develop new node communitiy on a branch, and what are some probably caveats and watchouts for that?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on technicolor, an abstraction above the APIs that various custom themes and theme packs use to access the colors for the currently loaded theme in emacs (like doom-themes&#x27; doom-color and modus-themes&#x27; modus-themes-get-color-value).
 The impetus is straightforward: if you are a user of a variety of themes or theme packs and you want to use your current theme&#x27;s color palette somewhere in elisp, but struggle to homogenize your code across all the possible themes you might have loaded at any given time, technicolor might be worth a look.
 It works by letting you define a &quot;universal palette&quot; of colors, which is a list of colors that can sensibly be accessed in a specified collection of themes, e.g. &#x27;(red green blue). You can then set rules for each theme (or group of themes) for exactly which color in the theme&#x27;s palette the universal color accesses. You can set these rules on a per-theme basis within a theme pack as well.
 From there, accessing the current theme&#x27;s color reduces to (technicolor-get-color &#x27;color), where color is an element of your universal palette. Technicolor will dispatch the appropriate API function, which you might have to write yourself, depending on the theme. 
 It also provides some basic color manipulation wrapping the color library, with the same ethos that accessing the colors should be via the universal palette.

How can I bind a custom key to a function that acts on the current vertico match in the mini buffer? E.g. Bind C-o to call my custom function which might open the current completion using the OS file browser? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I hope someone can help me. I am trying to work in emacs-jupter with REPL-client. I have set up and installed everything as recommended in emacs-jupyter and at first glance everything seems to work.
 If I run &#x60;M-x jupyter-run-repl&#x60; I can select one of the installed kernels and a new Ipython buffer opens:
 Launching org_test kernel...
 Starting org_test kernel process...done
 Launching org_test kernel...done
 Requesting kernel info...done
 However, if I then execute &#x60;M-x jupyter-interaction-mode&#x60; in the original buffer and then try to send code with &#x60;C-c C-c&#x60; I get: 
 &quot;Wrong type argument: &quot;Not a valid client&quot;, nil, jupyter-current-client&quot;
 Interestingly, when I try to establish a connection with &#x60;M-x jupyter-rep-associate-buffer&#x60;, no client is recognised and a new one is opened into which I cannot write with the same error.
 When I select a connection file with &#x60;M-x jupyter-connect-repl&#x60; a new ipython buffer opens with Requesting kernel info...done When I try to transfer code, jupyter-current-client is still nil. (same error)
 When I work with org-mode code-blocks and select a kernel, emacs-jupyer works.
 Is there any information that can narrow down the problem?

                              <span>When doing consult-ripgrep if I then do embark-collect the results of my query is nicely grouped by filename in the embark collect buffer. However, when doing the same consult-ripgrep query followed by embark-export (which is more powerfull than emabark-collect since I can use wgrep) the results are not grouped by filename, instead, every line starts with the file and line the result comes from:
  file1:line: ... file1:line: ... file2:line: ... 
 Is it possible to get the same behaviour in embark-export buffers as the one in embark-collect?
  ---- file1 line: ... line: ... ---- file2 line: ...

 I still don&#x27;t see any practical ways to use it even tho i have a feeling they are powerful....
 anyone is using them? and how do you use them?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a very long time, but I&#x27;ve never done much beyond very basic tasks. Recently, I moved back to Linux on my desktop, and I&#x27;m using Emacs a lot more, so I started running Emacs as a user service systemctl --user enable emacs.service and aliased the Emacs command to emacsclient. 
 I&#x27;m having some trouble on a few items and was wondering if y&#x27;all could provide some advice:
  
Is there a way, from a shell cmdline, to start emacsclient in magit mode? I find myself either launching with an unnecessary dired buffer with emacsclient . or a useless scratch buffer if I use emacsclient -t. 
 
Let&#x27;s say I have previous opened files A, B, C, D, and then quit out of emacsclient. If I run emacsclient E, if I C-x k on E, the client exits. However, if I C-x k on those other buffers, they&#x27;re killed normally and the client continues running. Is there a way so that killing that &quot;E&quot; buffer doesn&#x27;t exit the client?
 
I need some recommendations for packages that help me handle buffers. C-x b is getting way too annoying, especially combined with the previous point where if I kill the &quot;launching file&quot; it kicks me out of the client. I&#x27;m broadly thinking of some kind of tab bar or side frame that lists buffers (with some file path) that has good navigation. I do a lot of work that involves using the shell and manpages, and it&#x27;s so obnoxious how those buffers use an asterisk...
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’ve been working on a project using a major mode for an obscure language called Inform 6 and the mode has several issues with it, including weird and inconsistent behavior. I want to either edit or completely rewrite this mode but I have some questions about how Elisa works.
  
Currently the mode is supposed to automatically format object code and this works with any object declared with the language’s Object or Class keywords but if you create a class called (for example) Room it won’t recognize that word as declaring an object and thus won’t format it correctly. Would it be possible upon opening an Inform 6 file to have the mode dynamically identify such objects and format them correctly, or is that impossible? Currently I’m having to add the names of new objects manually to the package just to get it to format code correctly, and honestly even without doing that the package seems to get confused fairly easily.
 
Are there any good tutorials on creating a language major mode from scratch? I am interested in learning some lisp anyway so will already be consulting the GNU documentation, but really any kind of quick primer to understand how Elisp “talks” to the rest of the editor might help speed things up a bit.

                              <span>A question related to https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/ . Just curious, did anyone use tyrian to develop complicated forms? What would qualify as a complicated form? A form where you have fields that require front-end and back-end validation (and maybe back-end validation before the user submits the data), forms with drop-downs where the content of a drop-down depends on the selection in another field, forms with editable tables/grids or multiple read-only tables/grids whose data can be populated independently, forms where sections of a form are hidden or displayed based on other field values.
 I wonder if this pattern is conducive to developing such forms where the data can come from different sources. The examples I came across are simple forms and I am not sure what the code would look like if you have more complicated stuff.
 Thanks

 What are the best libraries for this?
 It looks like jsoniter is fast but doesn&#x27;t give AST.
 Is json4s with jackson the best option?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am implementing Fingertree from the following paper: https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html
 Of course, not an easy data type, but a great way to learn more about inductive data types in practice. I have managed to implement everything up to appending trees, which is what this question is about. 
 Source code exists here. Because it was a lot of work trying to figure out exactly how to implement append, I reused the functions in the source code. In my version, however, I do not use a Measured (there is no value, this comes later in the paper). Apart from that, everything is the exact same. However, on every single function (appendDigits1, appendDigits2, appendTree1, etc.) there is the error described in the title whenever I use Node2 or Node3 as an input for any of the functions that expects a as an input. For example: 
 addDigits1 m1 (One a) b (One c) m2 &#x3D; appendTree1 m1 (Node3 a b c) m2 
 causes the error in the title, where 
 appendTree1 :: FingerTree (Node a) -&gt; a -&gt; FingerTree (Node a) -&gt; FingerTree (Node a) 
 This is of course strange, because in the source code, they use the exact same abstraction where they feed appendTree1 a Node type as second input, without trouble. When I edit all occurrences of a to Node a, the error simply moves to the Node type itself, saying that Node3 constructor cannot take Node a as an input and expects a, even though Node3 (Node2 a b) (Node2 c d) (Node2 e f) is a perfectly valid output. Also, a should be an abstraction from Node a as far as I know. 
 What is happening?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Are there recent guides for automating CI testing of Haskell projects on GitLab.com?
 Specifically, setting up .gitlab-ci.yml files to run the tests in Haskell libraries with stack, against different LTS snapshots or different GHC versions?
 A few years ago I created one based on snippets I&#x27;d found in existing repositories. It used the fpco/stack-build:latest docker image:
 https://gitlab.com/robstewart57/gitlab-haskell/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml
 Alas, it no longer works:
 https://gitlab.com/robstewart57/gitlab-haskell/-/jobs/7250651651
 Any suggestions on getting a CI script, which runs this library&#x27;s tests against multiple versions of LTS (or at least multiple GHC versions), would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I am using the &quot;Agenda and all TODOs&quot; as my primary view to interact with the agenda. However, I struggle to configure it with org-super-agenda.
 My current config is
 (setq org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;( (:name &quot;In Progress&quot; :todo &quot;INPR&quot; ) (:name &quot;Todo&quot; :todo &quot;TODO&quot; ) (:name &quot;Waiting&quot; :todo &quot;WAIT&quot; ))) 
 which displays the undated TODOs nicely below the time grid, grouped by their state. But the items with a date associated are not displayed correctly:
 https://i.sstatic.net/EDSXKLUZ.png
 Enhancing my groups definition by a time-grid selector:
 (setq org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;( (:time-grid t) (:name &quot;In Progress&quot; :todo &quot;INPR&quot; ) (:name &quot;Todo&quot; :todo &quot;TODO&quot; ) (:name &quot;Waiting&quot; :todo &quot;WAIT&quot; ))) 
 fixes the agenda view but makes the &quot;Global list of TODO items&quot; printed ungrouped.
 How can I have both, a time-grid with correctly placed icons for icons that have a date and a grouped global TODO list?
 An example org file:
 * TODO Today&#x27;s item with time  that does not apear on the time-grid, but below * TODO some non-dated item which appears correctly 
 Disclaimer: this is cross-post, but I received no reply at StackExchange and org-super-agenda GitHub.

 I tend to prefer explicit or qualified imports, and generally find it a bit difficult to follow documentation, tutorials or code samples when imports are both implicit and unqualified. Following is an example of my struggle.
 This code works:
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-} module Api (MyApi, myApi) where import Data.Aeson (FromJSON, ToJSON) import GHC.Generics (Generic) import Servant instance ToJSON HealthCheckResponse newtype HealthCheckResponse &#x3D; HealthCheckResponse { healthy :: Bool } deriving (Eq, Show, Generic) instance FromJSON MyReqBody data MyReqBody &#x3D; MyReqBody { a :: String, b :: String } deriving (Eq, Show, Generic) instance ToJSON MyRespons…</span>

                              <span>I made a starter template for creating Haskell web-applications using HTMX, AlpineJS, Servant, TailwindCSS and Lucid (HASTL) - I really enjoy working in this stack and I think it brings together a lot of cool technologies with the awesomeness of Haskell doing all the heavy lifting! I also tried to make it &quot;production ready&quot; by adding build and test tools e.g. it comes with simple Make targets and with unit and integration tests that use testcontainers to spin up the database and web application to test against.
 It uses PostgreSQL by default but can work with any database supported by the persistent ORM, and handles migrations, model creation and more.
 It&#x27;s based on the awesome servant-persistant example by Matt Parsons (https://github.com/parsonsmatt/servant-persistent) and it&#x27;s licensed under MIT.
 The template is available on Github here:

 Hope this is useful to someone! &lt;3

 Here is an example comparing Emacs and Vim: https://i.postimg.cc/t4b0Xsrn/image.png
 Any resource to help understand why is that, and how to replicate that behavior in Emacs?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have read extensively on this issue, but I have not found a solution.
 I am running Emacs within a terminal on Linux. The terminal emulator I am using is &quot;foot&quot;. The linked page has a section with information relevant to the issue, found here.
 When I use Emacs, the Backspace character correctly deletes a character before the point. When I press Control+Backspace (C-BackSpace), Emacs understands this input as &quot;C-h&quot;. This behaviour is understandable, because upon invoking &quot;C-h v term-file-aliases&quot;, I see that the &quot;foot&quot; type is associated with the &quot;xterm&quot; alias. I take this to mean that &quot;foot&quot; implements the &quot;xterm&quot; terminfo, which has a particular specification here, that explains something about ^H and the BackSpace key.
 The README.md for &quot;foot&quot; has a section about what is tran…</span>

                              <span>I like the convenience of image-view for quick peaks at images from dired. If I need anything more involved, I open the image in an external viewer. I also like image-view n/p keyboard bindings to open next and previous image in the current directory. 
 Is there something like image-view but for audio? I’m aware of multimedia systems like emms and listen.el which focus on listening to music (and playlist management), but I’ve not come across any like similar to image-view. Closest is maybe mediainfo-mode. Am I missing others?
 I’ve been playing with a tiny major mode that I threw together. Seems to do the job, but wondering if there’s something already out there?

                              <span>I recently implemented the jinx &quot;enchanted spell checker&quot; and am overall impressed with the performance and functionality of the package. My configuration below modifies the &#x60;jinx-include-faces&#x60; to only check comments; text in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; and &#x60;text-mode&#x60; are also checked.
 However, I noticed that jinx behaves different in org-mode and prog-mode. Specifically, spelling errors in a comment of a code block are only flagged when I open the &#x60;org-edit-special&#x60; buffer. The text properties for a given comment in an src-block is &#x60;(font-lock-comment org-block)&#x60;. When I add &#x60;(org-mode font-lock-comment-face)&#x60; to my definition of &#x60;jinx-include-faces&#x60; spell check is effectively turned off across my &#x60;org-mode&#x60; buffer (&#x60;jinx-mode&#x60; is still active). I am aware of &#x60;jinx-exclude-faces&#x60; and that many faces in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; are excluded by default. Yet when I remove faces like &#x60;org-block&#x60; from that list, the entire src-block including variable definitions and functions are flagged as misspelled.
 Has anyone implemented &#x60;jinx&#x60; in &#x60;org-mode&#x60; in this way?
 (use-package jinx :hook (org-mode text-mode prog-mode conf-mode) :custom (jinx-include-faces &#x27;((conf-mode font-lock-comment-face) (prog-mode font-lock-comment-face))))

                              <span>For the record I&#x27;m a regular nvim user, I tend to use emacs from time to time to take notes on orgMode bc... Yeah I really like it. I&#x27;d like to know more about the editor, it&#x27;s a harder to find the specific capabilities of emacs bc everywhere I look people just say that it&#x27;s &quot;theoretically possible to do everything with it&quot; but even if my editor is Turing Complete and can run doom or be an OS by itself I&#x27;d like to know what are the realistically achievable things that I can do with emacs without going through years of learning and configuration. I&#x27;d like to also keep nvim bc terminal but this is probably my second favorite code editor (or IDE). I think it would be nice to see what needs you had that emacs covered for you individually, I don&#x27;t care how niche it is. Ty in advance.

                              <span>There are a lot of popular starter kits. I&#x27;m curious to see how they stack up. If I missed one, hit &quot;other&quot; and comment which one you use. I&#x27;d like to know why people pick various starter kits and what they like about them.

 UPDATE: ALRIGHT ALRIGHT I forgot Spacemacs! I threw this together late at night and that makes me a little stupid. I knew I was missing something big. So, I really hope I didn&#x27;t offend any Spacemacs enjoyers out there: it&#x27;s a magnificent project and it really should have been on this list. My bad. I do wish Reddit let me have more than 6 options though…

                              <span>A recent thread provided a solution for xwidget-related crashes in emacs with pgtk3 via the following:
 emacs -xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 However, I have recently started using emacsclient, where the problem has reared its head again.
 I start the emacs daemon automatically on login using the following command:
 ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/local/bin/emacs --fg-daemon -xrm &quot;emacs.synchronous: true&quot; 
 Out of my depth here. Appreciate any suggestions.

                              <span>I have struggled understanding how to do complex calculations in org-tables. Yesterday I spend some time and here are some hints and examples.
  
Check the calc section of the emacs manual. Any function available in calc is available in org-mode tables. Calc functions are named calcFun-. They are meant to be used infix in org tables. You can also use describe-function and completion to find functions.
 
Many calcFunc- functions take a vector as a parameter. Usually this vector is composed of strings (even if the function is numeric). The converstion from strings to numbers if done automatically.
 
You can define new functions for calc by defining a function using defun and naming it calcFun-. I recommend you look at the definition of a function in the emacs source code.

                              <span>Hi everyone,

Can Zettels be printed onto paper without programming or maestro? I record notes digitally and want to keep them in an A5 spiral binder for reference. I use both The Archive and ia Writer to make Zettels.


an I automatically update the format of all my Zettels so they&#x27;re consistent? I&#x27;ve tried different templates and would like to remove the YAML formatting instead of a simplified design and one that doesn&#x27;t hide tags and ID numbers when printed.


My current workflow involves using Zettels to take notes as I learn more about ADHD. Some of these Zettels contain strategies for coping with ADHD and include links to other Zettels that provide additional context and research.
I want to carry these notes in an A5 binder so that they are available when needed. Many of the programming solutions are over my head, but there could be an easy way to update Zettels to the same format and print them. I know iA Writer has an export template function, but I&#x27;m no coder. 
Thanks for any advice you can provide!</span>

                              <span>Hey guys. I&#x27;ve been asked to design any program/plugin/API that gets the project name, name of modules and the dependencies of each module. Any idea what I can do here 
 For example, in a maven project, we can use the maven session and lifecycle participant classes to extract info out of maven projects.

                              <span>Hi,
 Basically when I am in the org-agenda and press &#x27;l&#x27; to activate the logbook mode I see all my clocked entries. To change their face I need to change the &#x27;org-done&#x27; variable and that works fine.
 But when I press &#x27;[&#x27; I get additional logbook entries because this is bounded to the function org-agenda-manipulate-query-add.
 I am not sure what variable to change to change the face of these entries. Does anybody know?

                              <span>Posting this in case anyone else runs into the problem I&#x27;m seeing. When trying to install emacs-plus, either from a bottle or build, the clone attempt would fail repeatedly:
 Failure while executing; &#x60;/usr/bin/env git clone --branch emacs-30 --config advice.detachedHead&#x3D;false --config core.fsmonitor&#x3D;false https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git /.../emacs-plus@30--git&#x60; exited with 128. Here&#x27;s the output: Cloning into &#x27;/.../Library/Caches/Homebrew/emacs-plus@30--git&#x27;... error: RPC failed; curl 56 Recv failure: Connection reset by peer error: 999 bytes of body are still expected fetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet fatal: early EOF fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output 
 There are several &quot;it might be your network connection, it could be something else&quot; threads out and around. I&#x27;ve got a high speed fiber connection and traffic was light and latency was fine.
 What finally worked for me was to make some updates to my global git config:
 [core] packedGitLimit&#x3D;512m packedGitWindowSize&#x3D;512m [pack] deltaCacheSize&#x3D;2047m packSizeLimit&#x3D;2047m windowMemory&#x3D;2047m 
 Upping the default for http.postBuffer to 4 gig was also suggested. If you do that, be sure to set it back to the default.
 Another suggestion was to change the core.compression to 9. I didn&#x27;t mess with that. It was the inverse of the suggestion to turn off compression and do shallow clones manually ... I didn&#x27;t want to get anywhere near that sort of approach.
 I have some questions about running with a daemon on Mac still, but I&#x27;ll ask separately if I don&#x27;t figure it out. Hope this saves someone some time.

                              <span>Hello all!
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a while so far, but there is a thing that bothers me quite a lot: dual-space CJK fonts and their alignment.
 CJK programming fonts usually provide both half-width characters (for Latin alphabets) and full-width characters (for CJK characters). Thus, when rendering, the width of a full-width characters must exactly equal to that of two half-width characters.
 This is where Emacs fails; even fonts like Sarasa Gothic (which I know that they line up nicely elsewhere) will not line up when I actually use them. This is especially annoying when editing tables on Org-mode or Markdown, since the columns don&#x27;t line up.
 I&#x27;ve noticed for two Korean programming fonts I purchased (semteulche and hesalche) the characters line up if and only if the font height is set to exactly 110 and 120 respectively (or their integer multiples). I could repeat this process for all fonts, but in my HiDPI screen, I&#x27;d like to have my fonts taller than at least 130.
 Basically, what happens is below:
 \&quot;hesalche\&quot;, height 120. They line up nicely.
 \&quot;hesalche\&quot;, height 140 (which is my preferred font height). Columns start breaking up.
 \&quot;hesalche\&quot;, height 240. 240 is an integer multiple of 120, so the columns are back straight.
 Is there a way to fix this problem?
 Here is the relevent section in my WIP configuration file.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Source blocks can have header arguments. For example, from that link, here&#x27;s a source block with header arguments:
 #+NAME: factorial #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n&#x3D;0 fac 0 &#x3D; 1 fac n &#x3D; n * fac (n-1) #+END_SRC 
 The :results silent :exports code :var n&#x3D;0 part is the header arguments.
 I&#x27;m writing an exporter. I have a function that is exporting the source block, but I&#x27;m not sure how to access the header arguments.
 The purpose here is to have some custom header arguments. I see there are also switches, but I&#x27;m not sure the difference between switches and header arguments, except for that switches seem to need to be a single character long.

Overview
 Some features and prerequisites. The following setup is for Mac; similar settings can be applied on Windows.
  
After editing and saving files on mobile, you can immediately see the content updates in Emacs. Similarly, after editing and saving in Emacs, you will quickly see the updates in the mobile app, allowing for real-time collaboration.
 Automatic and seamless. On the Mac side, everything is fully automatic. On the mobile side, you only need to pull down to refresh in rare cases.
 No additional software is required on the Mac side except for Emacs.

My worry is that I hear with large amount of data in tables and formulas it&#x27;s slow... Would it be a paranoia to decide it doesn&#x27;t fit my financing requirements on the basis of it being slow down the line or is it at the point where you can throw thousands of pieces of rows into it without a stutter?

In PDF software, this is accomplished by adding a Highlight Annotation (e.g. keyboard shortcut 5 in Okular). In LibreOffice, the keyboard shortcut is broken but one can use the menubar to add Character Highlighting (actually applies to more than one character, but this is the name used).
 How can I mark up small sections of inline text in my Org mode documents, so that when they are exported with Pandoc it will use real PDF Annotations or real LibreOffice Character Highlighting?

                              <span>It&#x27;s great that you can ⌘V paste images into your posts and share screenshots with the community to talk about graphs and screenshots with everyone.
But we noticed that over the years, large and badly compressed images take up a ton of space on our hosting provider 
So today (2024-07-01) we&#x27;re introducing a size upload limit of 2000x2000 pixels, where larger images will be downscaled.
That should fit a whole screen&#x27;s worth of a non-retina screenshot -- and retina ones should compress without much loss for the viewer, so every picture should look crisp enough for sharing/consumption here while not inflating our bills.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve learnt a bit of Haskell, specifically the first half of Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton and a few others partially like LYAH
 Now I&#x27;m trying to learn Rust. Just started with the Rust Book. Finished first 5 chapters
 Somehow Rust syntax and language design feel so inelegant compared to Haskell which was so much cleaner! (Form whatever little I learnt)
 Am I overreacting? Just feels like puking while learning Rust

                              <span>I am trying to use emacs for programming python and c/c++. I recently upgraded my MacOS setup to emac-plus@30--with-ctags--with-dbus --with-debug --with-mailutils --with-no-frame-refocus --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp --with-poll. Now everytime I open a python script, I get the message File mode specification error: (error Feature provided by other file: project). I am unsure if this is something specific to emacs 30 or if there is something wrong with the following script I have been trying to use:
 (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((c-mode . c-ts-mode) (python-mode . python-ts-mode) (c++-mode-hook . c++-ts-mode) (c++-mode . c++-ts-mode)) ) (use-package eldoc :init (global-eldoc-mode)) (use-package eglot :ensure nil :hook ((python-base-mode c-ts-base-mode) . eglot-ensure))

                              <span>After updating to emacs 30, I&#x27;ve taken the opportunity to experiment with themes switching between solarized light and modus vivendi tinted. However, all of the themes I&#x27;ve tried so far have been too distracting when it comes to coding color schemes so I&#x27;m trying my hand at a minimalist one of my own making.
 Goals: 
 * Most text is black with only key elements highlighted
 * Only one color used: goldenrod which matches the rest of my theme well. I&#x27;m still deciding if I need a darker variant for string/constants or not.
 * de-emphasize/distinguish comments 
 * emphasize strings to handle the missing quotation issue.
 * Make types a slight bit different (semi-bolded gray) 
 * bold keywords

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to have a keybinding to
  
copy the defun/function the point is in into the kill ring
 insert the current file+line of the point into the buffer of the &#x27;other window&#x27;
  
The first one is to easily share a function with coworkers.
 The second one to easily write breakpoint locations into a debugger script file (gdb) that is open in the other window.
 Now, how can I determine the current function name the point is in, especially the &quot;fully qualified name&quot;? Example for C++:
 class C { int func() { // point here: I need &quot;C::func&quot;, not &quot;func&quot; at this point } }; 
 I&#x27;m aware of which-function-mode, but that one reports &quot;func&quot; and not the fully qualified name &quot;C::func&quot;.
 Any other ideas? :)

                              <span>I am trying to make an org document for my doom emacs config, it is basically like this
 ~/.config/doom/README.org
  #+title: Doom Emacs Config #+property: header-args :tangle config.el * Config part 1 #+begin_src emacs-lisp ... #+end_src * Config part 2 #+begin_src emacs-lisp ... #+end_src 
 but whenever I do M-x org-babel-tangle it says &quot;Tangled 0 code blocks from README.org&quot;, but the exact same thing works with my AwesomeWM lua config. I saw this reddit post, and they had the same problem, but I didn&#x27;t really get the solution. If you know how to fix this, please comment!

                              <span>I have installed emac-plus@30--with-ctags--with-dbus --with-debug --with-mailutils --with-no-frame-refocus --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp --with-poll and I noticed that when I try to play the Tetris game, the appearance is not very easy to use as I cannot see the blocks in the following text. I am wondering what could be the cause of this issue. It is the same for other games like snake in emacs:
 https://preview.redd.it/hs4piic82n9d1.png?width&#x3D;988&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a3e92d418178d2260557af53766aa0115a7adbef
 It works fine if I disable my init.el file, and I was able to narrow it down to the following svg code. But I am wondering what is responsible for this and is there any way around it:
 (use-package svg-tag-mode :straight t) (use-package svg-lib :straight t) (global-svg-tag-mode t)

                              <span>I left the language for a little while and I&#x27;ve been diving back in for the past few months. Around the time I left the standard way seemed to define all your effects through composing the various Monads provided by mtl. Towards the end of my time with Haskell however the consensus seemed to be forming that you really only need Reader over IO, using a sort of &quot;God Object&quot; like AppT or Env that holds all of your configurations and application state, and you would define more granular &quot;XMonad, YMonad, ZMonad&quot; types for particular effects, which the base AppT would then instance.
 Coming back I see a lot of buzz around algebraic effects, in particular polysemy seems to be the standout example. It seems pretty ergonomic, although I still have no clue how type level lists work or when they were introduced, so that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll have to get up to speed on. Is this something that I should be using going forward, or is it still in research mode, and I should stick with the standard mtl for now?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I hope this is okay to be posted here - this is a Haskell and Nix question. I have been trying to build a version of GHC that uses -fPIC with Nix. I have managed to do this and can use this version of GHC in a development shell, but I have had difficulty getting that version of GHC used when building the project with Nix. When running &#x60;nix build&#x60;, I get lots of linker errors to do with libraries not being built with -fPIC, but I can build the project just fine with &#x60;cabal build&#x60;.
 Here is my flake.nix file that I am using to build a shared library (it just exports one function that squares an int).
 Any advice on how to get &#x60;callCabal2nix&#x60; to use the custom GHC would be greatly appreciated!

 How can i rid off syntax errors in Vim (which appears in command line on the bottom, screenshot below)?
 Screenshot
 In code i just removed last quote to trigger syntax mistake:
 (line 7) putStrLn &quot;Hello, Haskell!
 SOLVED:
 Ormolu plugin was responsible for it, solved with adding to .vimrc

 Does someone know how to fix this?

                              <span>I work with a lot of Org files which have several top-level headline, some of which have nested headlines 2 or 3 levels deep in the subtree. Recently, I&#x27;ve found that after working on one of these subtrees for a while and collapsing the heading, TAB no longer unfolds that particular subtree, while others can be unfolded. Visually,
 * Heading 1: won&#x27;t unfold... * Heading 2: unfolds Blah Blah Blah 
 hitting TAB, or even C-c C-r (org-fold-reveal) has no effect on Heading 1. This sometimes occurs for higher level headlines in a subtree as well.
 Has anyone else noticed this behavior? (And hopefully found a fix?)
 This could be as a result of various settings I have in my init.el, including
 (setq org-support-shift-select &#x27;always) (setq org-cycle-separator-lines 1) (setq org-cycle-emulate-tab t) 
 and the fact that I use EVIL key-bindings.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 29.1, Org mode version 9.6.6.

                              <span>I discovered something about general.el that I think is neat. I recently started using perspective and wanted to be able to access the keybindings from perspective-map with general to use my own prefix instead of binding it to something like C-c M-p. 
 This works out of the box by specifying perspective-map in general-define-key:
  (general-define-key :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; &quot;p&quot; &#x27;(perspective-map :which-key &quot;perspective&quot;) ... ) 
 Pressing SPC p opens up the minibuffer with all of the perspective commands!

 I&#x27;m using utf-8 (U in the modeline) but setting the language environment to Russian neither does change the keyboard input and it the modeline changes to R and russian characters look wrong

 def attribute(self): return self._attribute 
 for example. Does anyone have an idea of such mode ? Or even how to code it in lisp with the help of a lisp library that can provide the list of symbols for the current document ?

Thanks to the Doom Emacs shipping, I knew of magit, projectile, LSPs and other utilities, but Emacs itself always came with wonderful &quot;utilities&quot; (e.g., M-x doctor, hanoi, calc, calendar, org ...) and just only to mention an example, I recently knew of M-x re-builder which I found awesome when doing M-x replace-regexp.
 In the end, I always feel like I&#x27;m not aware of a lot of functionalities in Emacs which are there, at my finger tips and thus the question, what are your favorite services/utilities/functions available in (Doom)Emacs?

                              <span>Community feedback request. In latest ellama release (already on MELPA) was added new command ellama-solve-reasoning-problem that implements Absctraction of Thought technique. It uses a chain of multiple messages to LLM and help it to provide much better answers on reasoning problems. Even small LLMs like phi3-mini provides much better results on reasoning tasks using AoT. I hope it can be useful. Also it can be reference implementation for your own chains.

                              <span>I wanted to have a way to temporarily run a command without an alias in Eshell, which is command grep or \grep in bash. After many attempts, this seems to work (entered in Eshell; to put in alias file, remove both of the &#x27;):
 alias command &#x27;export original&#x3D;${alias | grep -h --color&#x3D;never &quot;^alias $1 &quot; | head -n 1 | sed &quot;s/alias $1 //&quot;} &amp;&amp; alias $1 &amp;&amp; $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original &amp;&amp; unset original&#x27; 
 I have to set the grep color flags because I also have grep aliased.
 I just wanted to post this in case anybody else wants it, or if I&#x27;m stupid and there&#x27;s a much better way to do this, or if it could be simplified/turned into elisp.
 Welcome to the Emacs shell ~ $ alias command &#x27;export original&#x3D;${alias | grep -h --color&#x3D;never &quot;^alias $1 &quot; | head -n 1 | sed &quot;s/alias $1 //&quot;} &amp;&amp; alias $1 &amp;&amp; $1 ${cdr ${listify $*}}; alias $1 $original &amp;&amp; unset original&#x27; ~ $ alias rm &#x27;echo &quot;no&quot;&#x27; ~ $ rm test no ~ $ command rm test ~ $ cat test /usr/bin/cat: test: No such file or directory ~ $ rm whatever no

                              <span>I love to use emacs in batch mode for text manipulation. I have done it so much I started to enjoy it and started code golfing with elisp. Its great but there are a lot of long function names like &quot;with-temp-buffer&quot; that could be assigned to a single character. Also it should automatically output the current buffer to stdout and argv arguments could be easier to retrieve.
 Sure common lisp would probably be better for most answers but my brain has been trained to do things in a emacs buffer and by god thats how its gonna be!
 Long story short, lots of tweaks could be made to make elisp code shorter albeit harder to read. I considered byte compiling the code but it was actually more bytes! Maybe the solution is to use keyboard hotkeys? Or maybe the solution is a custom golfing language interpreted by elisp
 Would appreciate any questions or suggestions on this topic.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a developer who loves scala&#x27;s syntax and functional paradigm. However, my company is using kotlin and golang a lot and I want to understand the advantages of scala like type safe, correctness, compile-time error checking, etc. so that I can convince my company to use scala as well. Can you recommend any papers, blogs, videos, github repositories to learn these things? If there is a cost, I would be willing to pay.

 I created this package as part of the tooling I &quot;&quot;&quot;need&quot;&quot;&quot; (wink wink) to create publishing tools to host a static website using Fastmail, which basically exposes files stored in your account.
 I started with a couple functions to upload files, but then I wanted to list files...and a few days later I was putting it all in an independent package, yak shaving be blessed. 
 I hope someone else finds it useful! There are a few things to improve, but from my testing the last few days it works well. Probably the most glaring omission is recursive uploads/downloads. And maybe caching.

 config fragment that worked before:

 This is generating an error: (error &quot;Invalid face box&quot; quote (:line-width (1 . 1) :color &quot;#556b72&quot; :style none))

 I&#x27;m looking through the docs to see if anything has changed but haven&#x27;t seen anything yet - has anyone encountered this / know what&#x27;s going on?

                              <span>In a podman container run with -p 8192:8192, I run inside an sbcl image:
 (require &quot;jsonrpc&quot;) (defun main () (let ((server (jsonrpc:make-server))) (jsonrpc:expose server &quot;subtract&quot; (lambda (args) (- (gethash &quot;l&quot; args) (gethash &quot;r&quot; args)))) (jsonrpc:expose server &quot;quit&quot; (lambda (args) (quit))) (jsonrpc:server-listen server :port 8192 :mode :tcp))) 
 If I run
 (require &#x27;jsonrpc) (defvar *conn* (make-instance &#x27;jsonrpc-process-connection :process (lambda () (open-network-stream &quot;JSONRPC&quot; nil &quot;localhost&quot; 8192)))) (jsonrpc-request *conn* :subtract &#x27;(:l 42 :r 12)) (jsonrpc-notify *conn* :quit &#x27;()) 
 from an emacs instance running inside the same container, everything works fine. But if I run that same code from an emacs instance running on my host outside the container, I just get
 [jsonrpc] Server exited with status 256 
 I have no clue what this error code is, I cannot find it in the docs. I am not sure why this is happening, given that I exposed the port and the code works fine from within the container.

                              <span>I could name a lot of examples but one thing that I immediately couldn’t live without was the flycheck error list buffer. It is really handy for rust, since the compiler is so thorough, and it makes refactoring much less tedious. Ultimately, I probably use less than a quarter of the tools and features in emacs and many of the packages I have, so I suspect that there are dozens of game-changing tools right under my nose. What are some of your favorites, and how do you like to use them?

The latter has been built in for an enough time but I haven’t seen anything so far other then plans to add support for c in packages like combobulate or symex. Is there any released package that support it? If not, what package are you using for C/C++?

                              <span>After about 20 years of living in emacs, my left thumb has started to hurt badly, and it&#x27;s because keyboards place the left Alt key so far to the left that I have to bend my thumb inwards to hit it.
 BTW, I used to hit CTRL by curling up my left pinky, but now I use mechanical keyboards which allow me to press it with the left side of my palm, so, no pinky stress anymore.
 Anyway, back to the Alt. I&#x27;m trying to rewire my brain to use ESC instead of the Alt. Or, in cases where I need it pressed continuously (e.g. M-b M-b M-b to keep going back a word), I try to use the right Alt key with my right thumb. (A key almost never used.) It&#x27;s not easy, the muscle memory is strong, but I try.
 Do others here have the same problem? Any good suggestions?

                              <span>Is there a package/function that would allow me to move to the beginning or end of whatever I&#x27;m in the middle of?
 For example inside {}, (), [], &quot;&quot;, &#x27;&#x27;, html tags, jsx tags etc...
 A bit like https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-matchit but I wouldn&#x27;t have to navigate to one of the nodes in the first place.

I tried using tensorflow library but couldn’t find my way tbh Any help would be appreciated, thanks!!

In this part of the course, we discuss Haskell code with side effects, such as terminal input and output, disk access, networking, random numbers, global state, and more. We motivate and introduce the IO type that is being used for side-effecting expressions. We learn how to compose IO actions, do notation, and how to combine the functional programming techniques we have been using so far with the world of IO.

                              <span>Hello folks! Trying to start an all mighty thread...
 Haskell has evolved a lot since the &#x27;98 standard with lots of awesome features that many of us feel like we can&#x27;t live without. At the same time it has, in my opinion, become cluttered and inconsistent partially due to incremental nature of these developments and the need for compatibility.
 This leaves me to ask:
 What what you do differently if you were redesigning a Haskell-like language from the ground up?

 Right now running my/open-frame opens new frame as expected and shows my/transient at the bottom. Issues: 1) transient menu disappears the moment window loses focus. 2) if I exit this newly created window then going back to main instance of emacs will show this transient menu 3) transient menu not fullscreen. 
 This is how new created frame looks now https://i.imgur.com/lsVqIWx.png (shows currently opened buffer in my emacs and then shows my transient menu at the bottom)
 Ideal goal is something like doomemacs +org-capture/open-frame
 https://i.imgur.com/P76yrAd.png full height. Would love to be able to remove modeline too and show it afterwards doing refiling/capturing process. 
 Is there any packages or examples how I could achieve this?

                              <span>Hi, my org-directory is set to ~/org but I also have ~/org/roam for roam notes. I installed org-ql package which doesn&#x27;t recurse into the roam dir by default.
 So I found it has a variable to enable recursing:
 (defcustom org-ql-search-directories-files-recursive nil &quot;Recurse into subdirectories by default in &#x60;org-ql-search-directories-files&#x27;. This should probably be disabled by default, because e.g. &#x60;org-directory&#x27; may include deeply nested directories of non-Org files, such as a \&quot;.git\&quot; directory, Org attachments directories, etc, which would make it slow to list the &#x60;org-directory&#x27; files recursively.&quot; :type &#x27;boolean) 
 I use doom, so I set it in my &#x60;doom.d/config.el&#x60;
 (setq org-ql-search-directories-files-recursive t) 
 Restarted emacs and it still doesn&#x27;t recurse into the dirs. Did I configure it wrong?

                              <span>Sorry for the confusing title, but I&#x27;m having trouble describing my problem.
 I find window behavior in emacs is very difficult to understand. There are many commands that either create a new window or replace the current buffer with a &quot;temporary&quot; buffer (eg help window). And some commands simply replace the buffer in current window, some replace the buffer in the other window, still others create a new split. And when something takes over an existing window, sometimes when quitting it returns the previous buffer, and other times it removes the window altogether.
 So far I have not been able to discern a method to this madness and I am often surprised by what happens. A lot of winner-undo.
 First question: is there any underlying logic here I&#x27;m not seeing? Or is it just a free for all?
 Second question: how do you handle this? Memorize/internalize how each command will behave? Rely heavily on winner mode? Something else? 
 I recently stumbled on popper.el so was thinking to give that a try. Curious what others are doing.

                              <span>I love Emacs! It makes so many aspects of my work a delight. I LOVE the ability to edit files over SSH from Emacs. I have a Docker file that’s on my Linux box which takes a very long time to build; I wanted to keep my monitor and keyboard connected to my mac so I could work on other stuff, so I just SSH’d into the Linux box in iTerm and ran docker build. When the build broke, I could switch to an Emacs buffer that was editing the Dockerfile on the Linux box, make edits, then re-run docker build. Once it finally worked, I fired up magit and it Just Worked™ and ran all the Git commands over SSH. So nice!
 What delights you about Emacs?

However, magit is unable to commit because my identity is unknown to it from within the container. Is there anyway I can provide my git credentials set already outside the container to magit inside the container?
 Have I no choice but to copy my git config file into the container?

                              <span>I have evolved my approach to organizing large elisp projects, but still am not completely satisfied, in particular in attempts at keeping the byte compiler warning-free.
 Different approaches I&#x27;ve seen, and their pros/cons:
 Put everything in one giant file:
  
pros: easier to keep the compiler happy (though order within the file still matters).
 cons: harder to navigate/reason about. May be daunting for other developers.
  
Divide into multiple files along sensible boundaries:
 Put common functionality in a main package.el file, and require it in all sub-files.
  
pros: clean division of concern.
 cons: supports one-way dependencies only: package.el cannot use capabilities of any of the sub-files without declaring them.
  
Require all sub-files in the main file:

                              <span>I fiddled with compile-multi and projection-multi-compile to get my PHP projects to recognize the build commands I&#x27;m interested in.
 The README for compile-multi was enough to get this to work; the meat of the code is reading the composer.json from the project path, selecting the &quot;scripts&quot; key and listing all available commands.
 Since not everyone is rocking Emacs with native JSON support, I wrapped everything in (json-available-p). That level of indentation makes me sad a bit :)
 It works as is, but tips are welcome:
  
Is there a way to check for JSON availability when wrapping this as a package/auto-loadable .el file?
 Do you have any code review suggestions? Like better combining (message ...) nil in the un-happy path?

 When there multiple instances of a program this makes it impossible to find out which frame is running a program.
 Is there a way to add the screen a program window is running in to the helm-exwm window list?

First line: Combined Unique ID and Title
I use @Will &#x27;s Keyboard Maestro macro to create the &quot;empty&quot; zettel file.  For example, here is a recent zettel I made to capture a personal history item (between &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;End&quot; but not including those words).
Start
202406232104 Memories of Braefoot Valley People and Places
[[202406232104]]
#Unfinished    #Unlinked
The main text of the zettel goes here.....

                              <span>I noticed that when exporting org mode to a LaTeX buffer, it automatically converts inline math fragments delimited with dollar signs $n$ into the other format \(n\).
 I understand that there are advantages to the second way of writing inline math, but I was wondering if there were a way to customize this behavior so that inline math remains written with dollar signs.

                              <span>Hi, I have been writing clojure and fsharp for the last few years, and am currently looking to transition to scala. I get contacted by recruiters occasionally but it seems I am never invited to an interview probably due to the fact that I have no professional job experiences in scala. I have been learning scara so far and practiced it, but I&#x27;m not sure what else I can do to have myself get a job in this new language. Would you be able to advise me? I am thinking of writing small libraries or participating in open source projects.

 i am learning haskell mostly from this website..
 Is this good? or there is something better..? or any advice for a newcomer on learning haskell?
 also why is firefox version of the above website so much better than the Chrome one?

Competitive Programming in Haskell: sieving with mutable arrays by Brent Yorgey
This is one of those cases where for efficiency’s sake, we actually want to use an honest-to-goodness mutable array. Immutable arrays are not a good fit for sieving, and using something like a Map would introduce a lot of overhead that we would rather avoid. However, we only need the table to …</span>

                              <span>Integration testing, a crucial phase of the software development life cycle, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that individual components of a system work seamlessly when combined. Other than unit tests at an atomic level, every thing in the software development process is a kind of integration of pieces. This can be integration-in-the-small, like the integration of components, or it can be integration-in-the-large, such as the integration of services / APIs. While integration testing is essential, it is not without its challenges. In this blog post, we’ll explore the issues of speed, reliability, and maintenance that often plague integration testing processes.

I can connect to the repl just fine from emacs using sly, but when I try to compile a file, I get an error saying that the TRUENAME could not be found. I imagine this is because of confusion between pathnames on host vs guest. The manual says to use the following snipped
 (add-to-list &#x27;sly-filename-translations (sly-create-filename-translator :machine-instance &quot;remote&quot; :remote-host &quot;remote.example.com&quot; :username &quot;user&quot;)) 
 But I dont know how to fill in the options. Setting remote-host to localhost and user to root does not work.

                              <span>Hi, i installed gnus for emacs and then nnreddit.
 When i start gnus there is no way i can authenticate for reddit.
 There is a reddit group when i connect it connects and when i press u to
 subscribe to groups i get: nnreddit-rpc-call: ‘nnreddit-rpc-request’: response timed out
 How can i get nnreddit to work under Gnus?
 Thanks
 Ray

                              <span>Hello guys, i&#x27;m new to emacs(started learning 2 days ago), i&#x27;m trying to swap ctrl key and meta using this:
 (setq x-ctrl-keysym &#x27;meta)
 (setq x-meta-keysym &#x27;ctrl)
 now it works fine under x11 but on wayland only ctrl key gets remapped and the meta doesn&#x27;t get remapped so i end up with two meta keys (also i don&#x27;t want WM level remapping). does anyone knows what should i do ? 
 thx in advance❤️

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m running Emacs on windows with C# for my job. Everyone else on my team uses Visual Studio (obviously) and the files are encoded with &#x60;UTF-8-BOM&#x60; or &#x60;utf-8-with-signature-dos&#x60; in Emacs speak. Emacs somehow wasn&#x27;t reading these files properly and kept saying the encoding is ISO-LATIN-1 and would just print the BOM characters literally on the screen. I had no clue about all this except that I saw 3 weird characters every time I opened any file. So yesterday I decided to dig deep and gather whatever I can to fix this. After trying a few approaches what worked is &#x60;(prefer-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-with-signature-dos)&#x60;. The files are read properly now and the language server is also happy. I use Sharper to build and run my project and it started failing after this change. It uses &#x60;shell-command-to-string&#x60; and others to run &#x60;dotnet&#x60; commands in the project. The commands fail with
 &#x27;ï»¿dotnet&#x27; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
 The first 3 characters are BOM and windows command prompt cannot handle this encoding. Is there a way to fix this, either from Emacs side or from the windows command prompt side?
 EDIT: This is with GNU Emacs 29.1 on Windows 11.

                              <span>There was a merge conflict in my configuration and now I&#x27;m getting an error when emacs loads my init.el. I think I understand the error but I&#x27;m unable to find the location. Here&#x27;s the output from starting with --debug-init:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (invalid-read-syntax &quot;)&quot; 222 41) read(#) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; &quot;/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; t t) load(&quot;/home/brendan/.emacs.d/init&quot; noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #) #f(compiled-function () #) t) command-line() normal-top-level() 
 I tried using goto-charto jump to 222 and 41. The first location is inside a simple setq and the other is a comment in the first line of the file. How can I get to the point where the extra, or missing parenthesis is causing the read error?

                              <span>I know I&#x27;m supposed to be the acme mouse guy, but for lisp editing, I became enamored of the mouse functions in the SEDIT editor from medley interlisp, so I created some defuns and bindings to (mostly) replicate them in emacs. Code can be found at GitHub. It currently is very basic, sets global mouse bindings,etc.
 Enjoy!

                              <span>Hey all
 I am using Eglot to connect to the typescript-language-server which is used for both ts and js. However, my project does not have TS, it&#x27;s an older React project in plain JS.
 Now the problem is typescript-language-server will report type errors and throw the error on some JSX components that these cannot be used as JSX components which is really annoying. Is there any way to resolve this? In VSCode for example there is an option javascript.validate.enable&quot;: false to add to the editor config and it will not validate the JS files anymore, however, it will still provide code fix suggestions, like imports for example.
 If there is no way to do this, is there a way to at least somehow get the import fixes working or connect eglot to some eslint server if such exists instead of typescript-language-server?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: 
 The eglot code-actions do not work at all, I cannot fix imports anymore. Good thing is that I was able to get both eglot / eslint reports to show up in Flycheck, but code actions do not work and it still reports the type errors as well. Here&#x27;s the current config that I have:

                              <span>i&#x27;ve been using anki-editor.el and i&#x27;m loving it. i use it alongside org-roam to build a network of knowledge, while at the same time, create flashcards. however, there are times that i cannot write a flashcard using org-mode. an example is when i use my phone / another person&#x27;s computer, or when i write a card with image occlusion enhanced.
 when i create a card in anki, i want it to show up on a defined org file as an entry (so i could then use a refile command to choose where i want it to go). is it possible to do this with a python script? i&#x27;ve seen people online use python as an automation tool for anki, and i wonder if that can also be applied this? thanks

                              <span>Is the only way to install emacs with native treesitter by compiling from source with the &#x60;--with-tree-sitter&#x60; flag? For example, I know a package called &#x60;emacs-plus&#x60; exposes some flags like &#x60;--with-native-compilation&#x60;, though it seems to me it doesn&#x27;t directly mirror the available underlying available flags and it wasn&#x27;t documented if &#x60;--with-tree-sitter&#x60; is supported.

                              <span>So this is probably a very basic question, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution anywhere. I&#x27;ve been using conda.el to manage my python environments, and I appear to have my Lsp working fine. However, whenever I use the &quot;run-python&quot; command and try to run a file, it raises errors as if it was only using the base environment. The modeline says it is in the correct environment, but that is obviously not the case.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to incorporate launching emacs as emacsclient with the daemon running in the background. So far, I simply have an autostart script containing the line emacs --daemon &amp; and launch a frame with emacsclient -c -a &#x27;emacs&#x27;.
 I have an init.el and an early-init.el. I suspect it is the latter that is causing problems. The fonts are set in init.el.
 However, launching emacs this way results in a different font as compared to launching emacs with the daemon running. I&#x27;d really appreciate any help on this. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up MIT Scheme with Scmutils (mechanics.com band file) to work seamlessly with Org-Babel and Geiser in Emacs, but I&#x27;m running into issues. Here’s what I have so far:
 (use-package geiser :ensure t :config (setenv &quot;DISPLAY&quot; &quot;:0&quot;) (setq geiser-active-implementations &#x27;(mit)) (add-hook &#x27;geiser-repl-mode-hook &#x27;hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines)) (use-package geiser-mit :ensure t :config (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_HEAP_SIZE&quot; &quot;100000&quot;) (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH&quot; &quot;/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/lib/mit-scheme-svm1-64le-12.1&quot;) (setenv &quot;MITSCHEME_BAND&quot; &quot;mechanics.com&quot;) (setq geiser-mit-binary &quot;/Users/harish/Applications/mit-scheme/bin/mit-scheme&quot;)) (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((scheme . t))) (defun hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body) (not (string&#x3D; lang &quot;scheme&quot;))) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate #&#x27;hn-org-confirm-babel-evaluate) (defun hn-disable-trailing-whitespace-and-empty-lines () &quot;Disable showing trailing whitespace and indicating empty lines in the current buffer.&quot; (setq-local show-trailing-whitespace nil) (setq-local indicate-empty-lines nil)) 
 With this setup, I can start a Geiser REPL and it beautifully loads mit-scheme with Scmutils functions, including talking to X for graphics. But Org-Babel (whose docs claim that it relies on the Geiser REPL) seems to load vanilla mit-scheme and not Scmutils. I cannot get it to recognise D and other Scmutils functions when executing Scheme code blocks.
 What is the best way to ensure that the mechanics.com band file is properly loaded in Org-Babel sessions, just as it is in REPL? Any help to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!

When no buffers associated with files are open, I&#x27;ve restarted emacs, how does it have this path to prompt me with?
 When I have two files open in 2 buffers, how can I get ediff to use those files/directories, instead of prompting for some weird path?

                              <span>Why doesn&#x27;t dired/find-file update the path list when switching projects?
 I had an old clojure project and then created a new one with the same project name at the same root path. 
 IMO, because the path and the name are the same dired/find-file after switch-to-project lists the old and new project file and directory paths together.
 Should not the old project paths be removed, because it is not valid anymore?

I know it is not enough to simply add :global t, but I am stuck on how to do the modification.

 Here is the function defined by the package:
 (define-minor-mode org-starless-mode &quot;Starless org-mode&quot; nil nil nil :require &#x27;org (let* ((keyword &#x60;((&quot;^\\(\\*+ \\)\\s-*\\S-&quot; ; Do not hide empty headings!

                              <span>Hey, I recently started using the NS version of emacs 30 (previously I was using emacs-mac). The experience was great for most of the time but sometimes I&#x27;d get terrible stuttering which I eventually diagnosed to fringe rendering.
 As it turns out, the NS redisplay draws fringes by converting the bitmap into a vector where each pixel is a square. Both the &#x27;copy&#x27; and &#x27;fill&#x27; methods of such an NSBezierPath are incredibly slow on my system (perhaps rasterising a path was cached at some point but now on ARM MacOS Sonoma it is not?), with 90% of the cpu time being spent inside -[NSBezierPath copyWithZone:].
 I&#x27;ve come up with a patch that changes fringes such that they&#x27;re drawn using masked CGImages, which completely eliminates this slowdown when drawing fringes. But I&#x27;m no expert on NS so this might not be the best solution: https://gist.github.com/simmsb/7998452560b10a4de645a3d7d2adee32

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m curious to know what the workflow of fellow emacsers is on this sub. Do you run just one frame of emacs (no emacsclient) and use that one frame to do your work, or do you run emacsclient to work on multiple frames?
 I find the one frame workflow to be more integrated into the idea of using emacs for most applications.

 I&#x27;ve tried to look up stuff on comparing the two so that I can decide on which to use but I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything. 
 Anything on how they compare and why one would use one over the other would be great to know. Or if one is just simply superior in every way that would be good to know too.

 Hi everyone!
 In case anyone is collecting the Topps stickers for the current Euro 2024 tournament, I have created a small program which keeps track of your duplicates and the ones you still need.
 Essentially, you add the stickers you&#x27;ve got in files/Got.txt and it generates a list with your duplicates (together with how many extra copies of each sticker you&#x27;ve got) and the ones you still need. See the readme file for more instructions.
 This should work as it is, although there is still some room for improvement. Most importantly, how to print proper umlauts instead of escape characters in the files and how not to surround strings with &quot;&quot;. If anyone knows the solution to this please chime in! :)
 I hope this would be of help to someone. It certainly is it me as I couldn&#x27;t find a similar app for this tournament.
 Happy swapping!

                              <span>Just deconstructing a tuple is making each iteration overhead to around microsecond. For 3-tuples or 4-tuples, it&#x27;s up to a few microseconds. Does this make any sense.. is this what you would expect? Modern laptop CPU compiled with -O2.
 For tight loops, I&#x27;m doomed to go back to pointer management (Ptr) and IORefs? (to simulate variables, just so i can get closer to C speeds)?

                              <span>Dear Haskellers,
 We are happy to announce that there is a new job opening for a Haskell developer at Chordify! We have had some success via this subreddit in the past, so the content of this post may ring a bell to some.
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also make use of a custom Redis caching layer; you may know us from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema
 We are looking for a new proactive, independent and creative functional programmer to improve the Chordify backend infrastructure, core technology, and launch new ideas to join our team of experienced developers in our offices in Utrecht or Groningen. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information (e.g. expectations, salary range, secondary benefits) and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [menno@chordify.net](mailto:menno@chordify.net) 
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 For transparency: this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We do allow working from home, but expect our colleagues to be in the office at least 50% of their time.

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively new to Haskell programming, so please don&#x27;t be too harsh if this is a silly question.
 There&#x27;s a particular behaviour I&#x27;m accustomed to in vscode with other languages that Haskell&#x27;s extension doesn&#x27;t seem to provide, and I&#x27;m curious if any solution is available.
 In most languages, when you type out a functions name and then type the opening bracket for the function call, you get a popup showing the function signature, as well as the name of each function parameter as you type.
 In Haskell, you only get the function signature popup when you&#x27;re typing the name of the function itself, so you have to memorize the order of the function parameters, then go about actually typing them out. Sometimes, when there&#x27;s an error over a function, you don&#x27;t even get the popup when you hover over the function name, meaning you have to go elsewhere and type out the function name to check the order of its arguments.
 Some of this annoyance seems to be down to a fundamental incompatibility between Haskell and vscode; vscode expects a C-style language, where function calls are characterized by brackets, so can&#x27;t understand function calls without brackets. It also obviously can&#x27;t give parameter names, since parameters in Haskell can have multiple names because of pattern matching.
 Is there any solution to this issue, or is it just an annoyance you have to deal with?

                              <span>Serokell and the Haskell Foundation are excited to announce a community-led Haskell Certification Program. Serokell has developed an online testing platform for administering practical and theoretical Haskell problems. Haskell is a complex language, offering a wide range of techniques and features for programmers. It’s simply not feasible for a novice or intermediate programmer to master them all. The goal of the Haskell certification is to help standardize what it means to ‘know Haskell’ at various levels of experience.
 As a community driven effort, we are soliciting self-nomination for volunteers to take part in the organization and decision-making around the certification process. These volunteers will help determine how the certification process evolves and which questions are relevant to the various experience levels of a Haskell programmer. Volunteers from organizations that use Haskell professionally are especially welcome.
 Please send your self-nomination to certification@haskell.foundation by the end of July 10th 2024.

                              <span>I have a couple questions, if people don&#x27;t mind me asking.
 1) Are there any cabal build flags that tell it to maximize runtime efficiency, or is the binary I get from just running cabal build as fast the program is going to get? I&#x27;m not looking for removing safety, just wondering if debugging support can be removed for a faster run time.
 2) Would someone mind telling me the latest guidance for making a static binary? I know this has been asked many times, but searching around online I see a lot of old advice, and I&#x27;m not sure what the most current guidance is.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I noticed today a new section in the offical website: https://orgmode.org/. It&#x27;s called &quot;Project heartbeat&quot; and it&#x27;s an eclectic collection of links, mailing list messages, feature requests, links to specific git commits, some specific packages, etc. 
 I don&#x27;t think it should be in the TOP page of the official landing page for orgmode, pushing down the introduction, features, quickstart links and actual code examples. It&#x27;s distracting and of interest to a smaller group than to justify the front facing real estate. It can be put in the &quot;Update&quot;s, &quot;Worg&quot;, &quot;Contribute&quot; sections, pick your choice.

                              <span>Think about how you probably use magit, especially the log, where you tend to visit commits alongside the history, with the log in one window and particular log items in another window. Magit has a lot of views and these views often list items that can be in turn viewed in multiple ways. This list &amp; item interaction model has a lot of good karma with respect to both architecture and user interaction.
 I&#x27;m mainly picking on &#x60;org-agenda-list&#x27;, but not using the full window width always has bad voodoo in Emacs. When I see complex agenda views with a lot of information to the right of the list of items, I think it&#x27;s neat, but I also think it should be left &amp; right window for those cases so that the functionality can be remixed and viewed in a mix &amp; match kind of way. This is one of the main reasons I&#x27;m not building on top of agenda.
 Another reason this works with magit is because of collapseable sections for showing details of items. Vertical organization can hold arbitrary amounts of detail while left-right organization in a single window, well, this isn&#x27;t a web browser. Organizing information left-right in sections and controlling reflow are likely to not obtain a good result.
 This is related to casually spiking more work on afterburner, only at the pace that I am getting value out for now.

                              <span>Just installed emacs 29.4 pure GTK from source.
 When I run
 emacs --daemon 
 It says:
  
Due to a limitation in GTK 3, Emacs built with PGTK will simply exit when a display connection is closed. The problem is especially difficult to fix, such that Emacs on Wayland with multiple displays is unlikely ever to be able to survive disconnects.
  
And emacs daemon also doesn&#x27;t run.
 These may be two separate issues - the emacs GUI disappearing and daemon not starting, but in regards to the first, on a laptop we can expect there to be network connections to continually connect/disconnect. 
 Is anyone using a pgtk build on a Windows laptop running WSL2?

                              <span>Running emacs-mac (--with-no-title-bars --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick). 
 When I take a pic from my iPhone, send it to my computer, and try to view it in Emacs, it just shows as blank, both in dired as well as an org inline image. I can take a screenshot of the image and use org-download to paste THAT image successfully, but specifically a photo taken from my phone just doesn&#x27;t show up. (I&#x27;ve checked the &quot;most compatible&quot; setting on my phone, so it&#x27;s making JPEGs and not .HEIC or whatever. I tried .HEIC and they also don&#x27;t work.)
 Other .jpeg and .jpg files work, but specifically not ones from my iPhone. 
 Any ideas?

 I have an org file with this content:
 * John Doe
 :PROPERTIES:
 :NAME: John
 :SURNAME: Doe
 :PLACE: Disneyland
 :GROUP: Fantasy
 * Jane Doe
 :PROPERTIES:
 :NAME: Jane
 :SURNAME: Doe
 :PLACE: Neverland
 :GROUP: Power
 And so on...
 What i would like is to display only the headlines (+content) with say :PLACE:&#x3D;Fantasy
 And hide the rest
 Now with C-c / i see only headlines marked with &gt; when the property matches and the other
 headlines + content are still there
 With M-g i can go to the next match but all i want is only headlines+content filtered
 and hide the rest
 Is this possible??
 thanks
 Ray

                              <span>Hi everybody, I started exploring this world 3 days ago. I want to manage my notes with org-roam and org-download.
 How can I make images adapt to the width of the window dynamically? Because if the image is too large, it gets cut off halfway (and Emacs crashes many times).
 If this is too hard, How you manage this workflow?
 Sorry for my silly question, but I feel a bit overwhelmed when searching for information with so little learning time. Thank you very much.

                              <span>This version polishes the first-order refinement methods introduced in v2.5.0 and many compile-time messages enhancements.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called &quot;refinements&quot;) to types and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 There are many other features including: - Custom constraints - New zero-cost types - Many integrations with other libraries such as Cats, ZIO, Doobie, Decline, Circe...
 Check the README for further information.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just considering a rewrite of a webapp-server from Express.js to HTTPurple. The server does the following things:
  
Manages user sessions and injects user auth to all requests (to resolve an issue with opening protected raw files in new tabs, which is probably a terrible idea that needs rework anyways)
 Proxies paths starting with /api to backend servers
 Interprets other paths as paths to static files and serves them, if they exist
 Finally serves index.html if paths don&#x27;t match anything
  
All other routing is done in the SPA.
 Why do I want to rewrite the server? There is a very fine-grained role-based authorization scheme managed by the backend. For UX-reasons, some backend responses contain a permission object with some requests (e.t. GET /api/entities/ returns { data: ..., permissions: { create: true } }.
 Setting up accounts for all possible combinations of permissions is tedious, and for some combinations/new functionality, roles don&#x27;t even exist yet, so I would like to inject permissions to (some) /api/... requets after they return from being proxied to the backend. Express&#x27; imperative handler will not let me access the responses after a handler has matched, but with pure functions this should be trivial.
 So, are my use cases supported/possible with HTTPurple? Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trialling a digitized version of my small physical ZK, and I&#x27;m running into a small issue with what constitutes a seperate note.
Most of my notes are MUCH smaller than other&#x27;s, sometimes I can fit the entirety of the idea into the title. So I&#x27;m wondering if instead of focusing on reducing the idea I should be adding more of the &#x27;therefores&#x27; onto the notes?
For example, I have the following notes, which were titles only in the paper version but I have expanded on slightly in the digital.
The patient&#x27;s art is only understood through therapy, (Naimberg 1953)
Art seeks reaction, (artlust, 2024)
Art can only truly be understood in relationship
To me, the third one is the &#x27;therefore&#x27; of the first two. This is particulary obvious in the digital version where I expand slightly on &#x27;art seeks reaction&#x27;, because reaction can only happen in relationship. Initially I thought these are three seperate ideas, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.
Should I combine the second two notes?</span>

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
In homage to @jiwonac&#x27;s idea.
&quot;I posit that writing for an audience with a background similar to mine is a valuable exercise. This insight comes from my recent experience of writing short reports to communicate findings for research projects. I found that these reports forced me to clarify my thoughts and became a staple of my research strategy.&quot;…</span>

 I just released a new web framework I&#x27;ve been working on: FastScala - it includes some ideas from the LiftWeb framework and allows you to do very quick development, coding both the backend and frontend in Scala.
 If you&#x27;re curious, you can see more here: http://www.fastscala.com/
 Comments/suggestions appreciated 🙂

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for ideas or options on how to go about in some way incentivising through financially sponsoring (as an individual, not corporate), or co-sponsoring, an upgrade to an open source Scala.js 3 repository.
 I don&#x27;t currently have the time to do the entire upgrade myself (although I&#x27;d love to try and contribute some hours), and I want to give the upgrade back to the community (as opposed to just keep a private fork).
 What sort of option frameworks exist for this kind of approach to incrementally improving open source in general, and within the Scala specific subdomain?
 While my exploration is about the more general problem, here&#x27;s the particular repository upon which I&#x27;m currently focused: https://antoine-doeraene.medium.com/make-your-google-spreadsheets-scala-ble-5695d9dd784f

                              <span>Hey,
 I have a little brain teaser if anyone is interested.
 I have multiple list of properties (house, apartment, …). Each list comes from a different source. The goal is to group properties to avoid duplicates.
 Because every source has their own way of doing things, it isn’t as easy as group by address.
 I need to come up with a way to group by address, or by geo coordinates, or by bedroom + bathroom + size, or by cover picture, or … some sort of group by similarity score.
 Would anyone have a solution to such problem?

In the microservices world, we spend a lot of time making ad hoc http requests to debug failing services, do sanity checks, etc. As a GUI, Postman makes it pretty easy for beginners to get started with this sort of work. However, you quickly run into its limitations:
  
 Leaking passwords to postman.com, or into your exported files, is easy
  Importing/exporting Environment and Collection files means, in practice, that these files do not end up in version control
  Working in your preferred editor/IDE requires an impractical amount of copy/pasting

 E.g., Scala Steward PR: https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward/pull/3372
 (I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;m promoting the PR itself with this post 😂, but I&#x27;m way more interested in any answer to the previous question 😊)

                              <span>As a researcher who primarily uses interpreted language, I’ve recently been exploring compiled languages, especially functional languages. Right now I’m looking at Scala, and I really like its features. However, the jvm dependency, while great for some purposes (I do a lot of work in clojure), is a concern for others. One reason I’m looking at compiled languages is for building cli tools as static binaries that can be flexibly copied into docker containers, over ssh, etc.
 I’m curious how practical scala native would be for this purpose, or if I’d be better off using another language for cli tools. What if I wanted to do something that depends on third-party libraries, like image processing?
 Thanks for the help.

 Hello friends. I recently made a post here about switching to emacs. It&#x27;s been a few days (probably..? I&#x27;m sure you are no strangers to getting sucked into editing your .emacs file) I&#x27;m back with some updates!
 Upsides:
 Counsel, Which-key, Ivy, and Avy were all solid recommendations. these are instant benefit-adds that I could notice immediately. 
 Org mode is obviously a win. Org-novelist is also very powerful, but I have to spend a lot of time in that to really get a feel. I still haven&#x27;t setup magit yet (sorry! I know it&#x27;s amazing!)
 I opted for meow. I know, I got a lot of evil recommendations. Since I added the &quot;don&#x27;t recommend evil&quot;, and yet still got them, I can tel…</span>

                              <span>I have been using projectile for years and it works nicely. However, recently I have noticed that more people recommend project.el because it is lighter and has the backing of the Emacs maintainers. Therefore, I want to give it a try.
 One confusion about project.el is how to specify a project if no version control exists.
 For example, suppose I have the following directory:
 \---myproject | +---subproject1 | \---.git | | Makefile | \---subproject2 \---.git | Makefile 
 How to specify myproject as a project? Note that the myproject itself is under VC. 
 By projectile, I just add a empty .projectile to myproject.
 From Emacs docs:
  
Whether a given directory is a root of some project is determined by the project-specific infrastructure, known as project back-end. Emacs currently supports two such back-ends: VC-aware (see Version Control), whereby a VCS repository is considered a project; and EDE (see Emacs Development Environment). This is expected to be extended in the future to support additional types of projects.
  
Therefore I have to write a back-end by myself? or use EDE which seems rarely used?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I am looking for a way to customize my C indentation style in Emacs to fit my school style guidelines.
 One of the guidelines I am trying to implement goes like this: &quot;Each variable declaration must be indented on the same column for its scope&quot;, see my example below for clarity. 
 Example:
 int main(void) { int a; int b; int c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; float c; } int main(void) { int a; char b; unsigned char c; } 
 As you can see I have to indent the variables on the same column as their longest neighboring type name basically (C89 style).
 So far, I have dealt with it by remapping my TAB key to insert actual tabs with this elisp snippet: (local-set-key (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;tab-to-tab-stop) so I can indent everything manually. It does the job for me but I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to make full use of c-mode functionality to do that without having to write a super complicated elisp function that checks if the symbol at point is a C type and then indents it to the right column (with potential backtracking also). 
 I think the short answer is probably no but I&#x27;m curious how you would deal with this if you were in my situation or/and if you personally had to do any &quot;hacks&quot; to your c-mode config to fit some project&#x27;s guidelines. 
 I quickly skimmed through manual, it probably has all the answers I need but nothing really stood out to me at first glance.

 so I&#x27;m trying to follow the installation from here and in it it mentions MELPA. So I go to install MELPA from here but it mentions this
  
Enable installation of packages from MELPA by adding an entry to package-archives after (require &#x27;package) and before the call to package-initialize in your init.el or .emacs file:
  
yet my .emacs file located at the home directory has a single line
  
(put &#x27;upcase-region &#x27;disabled nil)
  
which I assume is because I enabled this command
 but I add the entry anyway and run M-x package-refresh-contents which tries to contact melpa.org but then it throws a signature error

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve recently started using Emacs and found it to be an incredibly cool and powerful editor. However, I noticed that there wasn&#x27;t a GitHub theme similar to what Neovim offers, so I decided to create one myself. I have developed GitHub dark theme, light, and dark dimmed versions. The theme has been tested on WSL2 running on Windows Terminal, but if you encounter any issues, please let me know on GitHub.
 You can find theme on Github.
 Key Features:
  
Customizable colors for comments, keywords, strings, numbers, etc.
 Support for various modes including org-mode, term, ivy, swiper, and more.
 Compatibility with Emacs 24 and later.
 Easily modifiable to suit personal preferences based on the provided code.
  
Since I&#x27;m not familiar with Emacs package managers yet, you can install and use the theme manually as long as autothemer is installed.
 Feel free to customize the theme according to your preferences. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please report them on GitHub :)
 P.S.
 I also tested the themes using the emacs -nw command. Both the dark and light themes work perfectly in the terminal. However, the dark-dimmed theme isn&#x27;t fully compatible because I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable color to replicate the greyish tone used in the GUI version.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble with citations in my Org-mode documents when trying to include them in QUOTE or EXAMPLE blocks. The current setup I have doesn&#x27;t allow citar to recognize and insert references in these blocks, which causes issues during LaTeX export.
 #BEGIN_EXAMPLE [cite:citationKey 20] #END_EXAMPLE 
 The above snippet gets rendered in LaTeX as:
 \begin{example} [cite:citationKey] % instead of \cite{citationKey} \end{example} 
 I see two potential solutions, but I&#x27;m not sure how to implement them, being quite new to Lisp:
  
Allow Citar to Add References in Blocks: Expand the context variable in citar-org.el to include blocks. Here&#x27;s the relevant line in the citar code.
 Modify LaTeX Exporters: Ensure that [cite] expressions within blocks get parsed correctly during LaTeX export.
  
What would be the best approach to achieve this? Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!

 I came from update org to version 9.7.5 and now I have an issue running a emacs-lisp block source. The block source is very simple:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :session ego :results output
 (setq org-babel-python-command &quot;~/.virtualenvs/data-science/bin/python&quot;)
 +END_SRC
 The message error is: &#x60;org-babel-execute:emacs-lisp: ob-emacs-lisp backend does not support sessions&#x60;.
 What&#x27;s wrong with my block source code ?

                              <span>I just released Org mode 9.7.5 that fixes a critical vulnerability. The release is coordinated with emergency Emacs 29.4 release.
 Please upgrade your Org mode or Emacs ASAP.
 The vulnerability involves arbitrary Shell code evaluation when previewing attachments in Emacs MUA (gnus-based: at least, mu4e, Notmuch, Gnus itself) or when opening Org files. All the earlier versions of Org mode are affected.
 Note that the vulnerability solved in this release has nothing to do with recent Org 9.6.23 release (https://list.orgmode.org/871q7zbldp.fsf@localhost/). It existed since long time ago and was discovered by accident.

I&#x27;m Justin, a 32 yo nurse assistant who work with elders suffering from severe dementia.
I&#x27;ve been lurking here for a few months and finaly found the time to convert my website to a zettelkasten(ish) thinking machine.
I&#x27;ve been exploring ideas about caring, gardening and sociology for a few days and I quite enjoy the process.
Luhmann ID user I&#x27;m currently between Obsidian and Acme Editor (plan9). I&#x27;ve been working on a few shell script to adapt my workflow with the later as I find it quite relaxing when writing.
Thanks for all users here for your greate debates and ideas. A pleasure to read, a pleasure to think about.
Take care,
Justin</span>

                              <span>(This is one of the reasons I don&#x27;t like building/installing emacs myself. When I built 29.1, this happened and now it&#x27;s happened again with 29.3 and I can&#x27;t remember how I fixed it...)
 This is for Ubuntu 22.04, using a pretty stock GNOME desktop environment.
 Having just updated emacs to 29.3 by building and installing it myself (under /usr/local), I am having some weird interaction with the GNOME desktop. I run emacs directly, and leave it running for my session. I have (had) the desktop icon fixed in my taskbar. I only just noticed this morning that there was a second emacs icon in the taskbar while the application is running. Hovering over the icon, it reads, &quot;Emacs (Client)&quot;. I thought perhaps there was a minor conflict between 29.3 and 29.1, so I removed the fixed icon from the task…</span>

                              <span>I recently joined a project that refuses to use clang-format so I will need to disable apheleia for that project. I&#x27;m doing it right now as hook for the entire mode as shown below but I would love to do it for the given project so I can work in other projects that do actually use clang-format. Does anybody knows how to accomplish this? Below my current config simplified:
  (use-package apheleia :preface (defun my--disable-apheleia () (apheleia-mode -1)) :hook ((prog-mode . apheleia-mode) (c-ts-mode . my--disable-apheleia) ;; TODO: how to do this per-project as opposed to per-mode? (c++-ts-mode . my--disable-apheleia) ;; TODO: how to do this per-project as opposed to per-mode? (c-or-c++-ts-mode . my--disable-apheleia)) ;; TODO: how to do this per-project as opposed to per-mode? )

 I&#x27;ve been looking something to make graphic notes like obsidian&#x27;s canvas for a while now, and I spotted this today. Absolutely brilliant package.
 And the same method(ors-get-id and copy to canvas) works on obsidian-excalidraw as well

                              <span>Hi. I have trouble setting up mbsync to properly handle deletion in two GMail accounts. They&#x27;re configured identically (&quot;When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted&quot; &#x3D; &quot;Auto-Expunge off&quot;, &quot;When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder&quot; &#x3D; &quot;Move the message to the Trash&quot;), however, the behaviour for them is quite different. For the first one, it is more or less fine:
  
👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to trash
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive moves it to trash
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 👌 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive moves it to trash
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing (the email gets removed from my local maildir, but it is still present in GMail web interface)
  
However, for the second account (configured identically) the situation is much worse:
  
🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash for mail in archive does nothing
 🤷 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in inbox moves it to archive
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in archive does nothing
 😠 mu4e-headers-mark-for-delete for mail in both inbox and archive does nothing
  
I&#x27;d like to have a way to just press a button and send an email to trash folder, without checking where this email comes from.
 Is it something I&#x27;m missing, some kind of hidden GMail setting or perhaps something in mbsync configuration? Here&#x27;s how I configured mbsync: https://pastebin.com/7wR4RCpt

 SVG specifications allows flowing text along a curve via textPath element. This opens up possibilities for cool text effects e.g. Formula Editor in GNU Emacs.

 (I also welcome any alternatives that do something better than libhunt but have no associated Emacs package)

 I recently started using eglot and pyright for my python setup and it works as expected (I think) on my local machine. However it stops working when I start coding on my remote server. I get the following errors:

                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;d like to announce release 0.13.0 of dunai. It is accompanied by a matching release of dunai-test and bearriver.
 Dunai is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. Dunai can be used to implement other reactive and FRP frameworks on top, including Classic FRP and Arrowized FRP variants.
 Dunai comes with:
  
bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.

                              <span>In Haskell, why is the following code valid:
 haskell f :: a f &#x3D; f 
  
Is it because we can infer the return type, together with Haskell not requiring a term to have parameters and being lazy?
  
What I mean is that I can get something similar in ML only in two steps:
 ocaml let rec f (x: &#x27;a): &#x27;b &#x3D; f x let x : &#x27;a &#x3D; f () 
  
How does this relate to the halting problem?
 Having a inhabited bottom makes Haskell&#x27;s type system inconsistent and, hence, unsound (because inconsistency implies unsoundness). So why do we say that it is sound? Do we say that considering just the consistent subset? (I&#x27;ve read the article on fast and loose reasoning).
  
Note: Haskell is my favorite language, so I&#x27;m not trying to bash it. I&#x27;m writing an assignment for uni on formal logic about consistency in lambda calculus. I would appreciate it if someone could answer as objectively as possible so I can further my investigations on how Turing completeness (the inclusion of general recursion) impacts consistency in type theory.

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I would like to know if there is a way to have an org-agenda view for today presented in a time-grid view where I can see my notes, state changes, clocks and all the things from logbook?
 The idea is to visualize in a single time-grid view for a day all the logbook related things from my TODOs. So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.
 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

 I need a basic lsp setup with treesitter
 Can you guys link to specific snippet?
 Treesitter is not showing correct syntax highlighting on my end especially for c++-ts-mode
 Lsp is working but c++-ts-mode is not
 Is there a thing in emacs like kickstart in neovim?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using eglot over tramp for python development. lsp is pylsp. I use pythonic-activate to activate the venv after tramp to the remote machine, and eglot works out of box, which is great.
 The problem is I&#x27;m asked for password twice for each python file I visited. This is not there when I don&#x27;t have eglot, so I think it is eglot establishing connection or something. I use ssh config to hop 3 times into the remote server, one with public key and other 2 password, so I had to type 6 passwords for each file I opened(and they are all different), which is annoying.
 Does anyone else have this problem? How do you solve it?(make eglot ask for password less often)

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m a writer, and a programmer. I&#x27;ve in the past obviously leaned towards vim for my text editing &amp; writing, and have become very comfortable in that environment with vim movements.
 Recently I&#x27;ve decided to give emacs a try (as I&#x27;ve always wanted to), and after hearing about org-mode (&amp; org-novelist, export with pandoc, etc) I wanted to try and move my workflow over to emacs for writing. I have a few questions though:
 What is the best way to move around a text file, in your experience? I&#x27;m of course reading through documentation, but things like sexp movement don&#x27;t benefit much from prose! In Vim I could move to any line and any word with a pretty quick series of inputs: is this possible in emacs?
 What are some must haves in the config? i&#x27;m doing vanilla (please don&#x27;t recommend evil--I want to experience emacs for what it is) This is specifically for writing. I know emacs has thousands of commands, and I can only imagine it has a similar amount of settings (setq&#x27;s? what are these called?)
 I already have lived a long life with capslock as ctrl (started after i got a HHKB, couldnt&#x27; go back) but is there a way to use meta/alt as spacebar instead? I know I said no evil, but space as my leader key has been something of a game change in terms of ergonomics for me.
 Finally I plan on just using bleeding edge, building from source. I know theres some exciting things that have just came out, or will be coming out in 30. Has anyone had any issues using the --pgtk with wayland? It&#x27;s hard to find any communication about this back and forth online (i suppose a lot of emacs folks are still on mailing lists or on matrix and not reddit/discord)
 I&#x27;ll appreciate any feedback, even if it&#x27;s not regarding a question. Thanks so much
 edit: thanks for all the help. I have literally never made a post on reddit in over a decade between many accounts that received such useful input.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I want to be able to narrow down the candidates to SWITCH-TO-BUFFER not only based on the buffer/file name, but also based on the major mode (or any other information provided by MARGINALIA, for that matter).
 Is there some integration, or some variable I can set? I struggle to believe that no one else has run into this problem, so I am CERTAIN someone has already encountered and fixed this problem.
 I am glad for pointers, advice and recommendation.
 Have a good day, fellow &#x27;macsers!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been unsatisfied with existing tree file browser packages for emacs, they all have been too slow for me. 
 Expanding whole tree for bigger projects takes, like, forever, so I&#x27;m writing my own.
 It mainly utilities unix tree command output:
 https://gitlab.com/OldManProgrammer/unix-tree
 one functionality it&#x27;s missing is interactive expand / contract tree, for example:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ │ ├── testImage.jpg │ │ └── testImage.png │ └── shaders/ │ └── default.glsl 
 contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ │ ├── images/ │ └── shaders/ 
 and even more contracted would look like:
 ├── assets/ 
 Before i write my own logic for this, i thought built-in outline-mode could be a perfect fit for this.
 But I&#x27;ve been playing with outline-regexp for quite a while, and i always can&#x27;t quite get it right.
 if anyone is interested, i can post repo for this later in the comments. Its&#x27; pretty simple, but i want to fix few more things.

 Is there maybe a known list of packages that this one conflicts with?
 Edit: It seems that removing the :commands line fixes this (but results in &quot;function X might not be defined&quot; squiggles for both of the :config commands).

                              <span>I am wrecking my brain over the following:
 (fmap . fmap) sum Just [1, 2, 3] yields Just 6
 But why? a composed fmap, in my understanding, is to &quot;jump&quot; (so to speak) over the structure of 2 functors, in this case Maybe and [] functors. So why is this not an error? Isn&#x27;t this supposed to run sum on the values of the list?
 I would expect:
 fmap sum (Just [1,2,3]) to yield Just 6, and indeed it does (with paranthesis).
 What am I missing here?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit:
 Even if I follow the types, I get:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: (Functor f1, Functor f2, Foldable t, Num b) &#x3D;&gt; f1 (f2 (t b)) -&gt; f1 (f2 b)
 where f1 &#x3D; Maybe, f2 &#x3D; [], t &#x3D; [], and Num let&#x27;s say is an Int, so:
 (fmap . fmap) sum :: Maybe [[Int]] -&gt; Maybe [Int]

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I would like to know if there is a way to have an org-agenda view for today presented in a time-grid view where I can see my notes, state changes, clocks and all the things from logbook?
 The idea is to visualize in a single time-grid view for a day all the logbook related things from my TODOs. So in exactly the same way as the SCHEDULED items are shown on a time grid now, I would like to see notes, clocks, state changes etc for all TODOs.
 If such a view is not possible, I would like to implement it. Is there any advice you can give, or a suggestion, on how I could manipulate the time grid view to display data I parsed from logbooks? I could format it while parsing in any way it is needed but the display of information on the time-grid I am not familiar with.

                              <span>i&#x27;m basically writing down a list of various stuff, and it&#x27;s organized like this:
  - total [/] - first category [/] - game one [/] - expansion one [/] - [ ] foo - [ ] bar - expansion two - second season - [ ] foo - [ ] bar - [ ] biz - second category [/] - game two [/] etc...  
 as you can see it&#x27;s subtree shenanigas; now, I tried to re-do the file from scratch, and checking for syntax errors, but everytime i try to C-c C-c the 40th counting box I get this error (with backtrace) 
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument integer-or-marker-p nil) org-update-checkbox-count() org-update-statistics-cookies(nil) funcall-interactively(org-update-statistics-cookies nil) call-interactively(org-update-statistics-cookies) org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c(nil) funcall-interactively(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c nil) call-interactively(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c nil nil) command-execute(org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c)  
 i tried on Org version 9.6.24, emacs 29.3 and 30, but I always get stuck at the 39th, the 40th throws that error.
 any idea on what i&#x27;m doing wrong? I can share the file if that help, it&#x27;s just a collection of RPGs and Tabletop games that i want to collect, it&#x27;s nothing too personal, but i would rather get what exactly i&#x27;m doing wrong.
 also, I have this at the top of my file: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src emacs-lisp
 (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-RET&quot;) &#x27;org-insert-todo-heading) (setq org-checkbox-hierarchical-statistics nil)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.
 thank you all for your help!

                              <span>In recent years, many ideas from Haskell, mainly those rooted in category theory, have found their way into Scala and become well-established in parts of the community.
 Coincidentally or not, many Scala developers have started to migrate to Kotlin, whose community takes a more pragmatic approach to programming and is less inclined towards category theory.
 Haskell is quite open about its goals, with the slogan “avoid success at all costs.” This philosophy allows them to experiment and conduct language research without chasing mainstream success. I&#x27;m curious about the Scala community&#x27;s vision for Scala&#x27;s success.
 While Haskell is extremely aware and open about its goal of not chasing success, how aware is the part of the Scala community that promotes Haskell&#x27;s ideas?

 Can someone help me, I want to implement the createNewUser function. If the error already exists, it will return an AlreadyExistsError. If it doesn&#x27;t it will insert the user in the database and return the UUID.
 Edit: Used generic F instead of IO

                              <span>This week marks the release of the 10 year anniversary edition website overhaul 
We&#x27;ve changed the landing page to better guide new readers into the topic, and we overhauled the blog to provide a table of contents that helps with orienting and navigating in longer documents.
One caveat, though:  the table of contents navigation doesn&#x27;t yet work on mobile. I think a sidebar/temporary toggle would be best on constrained devices, but that requires more JavaScript, so let&#x27;s not be too hasty 
Hope you enjoy it!</span>

                              <span>I would appreciate if anyone knows if there is a way to set up the template for the name of the images pasted into The Archive - at the moment it seems to be &quot;YYYY-mm-DD HH-MM Pasted Image.png&quot; - and I want to get rid of the spaces in the name as it then causes troubles when I try to preview my notes in 1Writer.
&quot;Hidden Preferences&quot;. 
Oh, and while I am at it, for some reason I can now also not find the setting for the new file ID in The Archive! I set it to be YYYYmmDDHHMM and vividly remember how I removed the seconds, but now fail to figure out where that setting is! 😅 In other words, I am lost in the settings - which are not many - so feels like I am lost in a forest of three pines 😄
Thanks in advance to anyone kind to respond!</span>

                              <span>I am currently using a custom-built emacs (29.1) on my Ubuntu 22.04 system. I decided just now to try the Homebrew version, to see if there were any config issues or anything. There aren&#x27;t, but it seems to be limited to terminal-only. I can&#x27;t seem to get it to run a GUI.
 Is there a way to get this through Homebrew? I&#x27;d like to keep emacs (relatively) up-to-date, but don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to rebuild it regularly.

 When emacs starts up and it hits the (use-package corfu-popupinfo ...) clause it invokes package-refresh-contents - which tries to go online and fails. I can confirm this by putting a (debug-on-error #&#x27;package-refresh-contents) in there and I get a debug trace:

                              <span>Dear members of the church of emacs, 
 I have a fairly good laptop setup (rtx 4070,i9, 32 gigs) and have been ok with using windows (this is only OS i have ever really used). Recently, I realized that I really just use my laptop for 5 main things: VS Code (mostly for simulations), Browsing, Latex, Obsidian notes, and file explorer (or on the rare ocassions, some MS office software). And I have been really thinking, if it would be possible to maximize my comfort and efficieincy if I could find a way to manuever between these seemesly, at first I thought about downloading Linux (Gentoo/arch/nix) but since I have 0 experience with it, I am unsure if it would just end up making my life harder instead of easier. 
 Then I heard from a friend that I could just use EMACS to combine all of these things and get it pretty close to an OS. I have zero experience with emacs and wanted to ask if it could be the key for this seamless vision I had?
 Thnx !

                              <span>[SOLVED]
 I just built the latest Emacs on Ubuntu 22.04:
 GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2024-06-20 
 It starts with a 10-point font no matter what I do. I&#x27;m using the same config that works fine on older versions of Emacs and always starts with a larger font. If I use &gt; Options &gt; Set Default Font, I can select a font that works for *that session only*. If I click on &gt; Options &gt; Save Options, it adds this to my .emacs:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(default ((t (:family &quot;Ubuntu Mono&quot; :foundry &quot;DAMA&quot; :slant normal :weight regular :height 143 :width normal))))) 
 Upon reopening Emacs, the font is back to 10 point. This basically makes Emacs 29 unusable.

                              <span>Hey. I wondered how, or if, you guys setup your editor indentation, comment and general source code formatting rules, on a per-project basis, and how well that works with projects using external source formatter configurations?
 For instance, if working on a C/C++/Python project using clang-format, ruff, gnu-indent, or uncrustify to format its source, how do you tell your Emacs to use the same rules according to their settings? Also, how do you keep this on a per-project basis (.dir-locals or similar) ?
 Any advice or anecdotes are welcome :-)

                              <span>What are the best practices to keep your emacs environment in sync across multiple devices? I&#x27;ve always used SyncThing to sync what emacs considers my HOME folder between devices, but I&#x27;ve encountered some problems below with my ELPA folder where packages are installed (&quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa&quot;).
 Specifically I noticed that when I upgraded emacs from version 28 to 29 on one machine and then upgraded some packages like pdf-tools and org-mode on that machine, those packages (which SyncThing synced to my other devices) no longer worked on the machines still running emacs 28 because emacs 29 has some new functions that those two packages use, like defvar-1.
 So should I have different ELPA folders for different versions of emacs, e.g., by putting a line in my init.el like (setq package-user-dir (concat &quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa-&quot; emacs-version))?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a few packages I&#x27;ve developed, and for various reasons they&#x27;re not on Melpa.
 But I still want to use them. I guess I could add a (load-file &quot;path/to/file&quot;) to my init, but that feels a little odd for some reason.
 What do y&#x27;all do?

                              <span>Is there some way to get Emacs to show the JavaDoc (or other language equivalent) in a popup for the function at point?
 I like the idea and expressiveness of such documentation, but I am never going to run my code through a doc formatter like Doxygen, but it would be helpful if Emacs could make use of it.
 Eldoc shows my function and the parameter names, but none of the available docs for each parameter.

                              <span>I didn’t find any solution in documentation. I have all my tables in a specific schema say abc. By default beam or any other database library works with public schema. How to set the schema in beam? It would also work if I can set the schema at Postgres-simple level…maybe while creating the connection. I looked around for other languages, there are some solutions that says you can pass in key&#x3D;value parameter in the connection string with your current schema&#x3D; . I didn’t try it because there is no mention of it jn postgres documentation.

All my projects (2008-2023) by Chris Done
It might be a “getting old[-er]” thing, but I’ve recently started feeling like documenting the complete set of software projects I’ve worked on that I remember. Not as a CV (an advertisement of paid work), but a comprehensive list of everything.

 I&#x27;m using Jaxson Van Dorn&#x27;s invoice template from here: https://github.com/woofers/org-invoice-template
 As you can see, the sub-totals for each day are correct, but those subtotals, for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, aren&#x27;t being summed together to arrive at the correct total for the invoice.
 I have scrutinised the formula, but I&#x27;m rather new to org table formulas and find the cell references alone difficult to follow, so I can&#x27;t spot what&#x27;s amiss. Can someone identify what&#x27;s going wrong?

                              <span>This might be kind of an obscure question, but here goes anyway:
 The LaTeX memoir document class has a nice feature to add breaks within a chapter, called \pfbreak (plain/fancy break). What it does is add a couple of lines between paragraphs, when the break is in the middle of the page, and adds 3 asterisks to the top or bottom of the page, when the break is between pages.
 In a regular LaTeX document, I can get it to work fine, but in Org Mode, I&#x27;m struggling. The break in the middle of the page works, but if the break is between pages, I don&#x27;t get the 3 asterisks.
 I figured all I would have to do is add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \documentclass{memoir} to the in-buffer settings, and then use $\pfbreak$ when I wanted to add a break, which seems to be somewhat right, since it works in the middle of a page. Just not the end.
 Any way I can track down what I&#x27;m missing, or if this will even work in Org Mode?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
I&#x27;ve honestly avoided writing this post because I don&#x27;t think I am accurately conveying the issues I&#x27;m having but I do really want feedback from you all - Here are some things I&#x27;m struggling with.
So first of all, I notice that I&#x27;m really stuck in my ways and often seem to write essays rather than notes. In order to avoid stressing about a note being atomic, I try to allow my notes to build up until they naturally can be broken down. However, by then, I feel like the statements are too intertwined and codependent and then I struggle to break things down. This is mainly referring to things I write about from background knowledge but happens with referenced things too.
I really want to know how other people structure arguments, claims they don&#x27;t believe, and things they don&#x27;t…</span>

                              <span>One of the key features of Nickel is the merge system, which is a clever way of combining records, and allows defining complex configurations in a modular way.
This system is inspired by (amongst others) the NixOS module system, which are the magic bits that tie together NixOS configurations and gives NixOS its insane flexibility.
Nickel merging and NixOS modules work slightly differently under the hood, and target slightly different use-cases:
Nickel merge is designed to combine several pieces of configurations which all respect the same contract. This allows an application developer to define the interface of its configuration, and have the user write it in a modular way.
NixOS modules, on the other hand, are designed to combine pieces which not only define a part of the final configurat…</span>

 Coming to vim, I would typically navigate my file system through basic shell commands like cd and would then edit the files with vim filename.txt.
 With emacs, instead of using dired to open files, is there a way I could directly open them using vterm?

                              <span>One common concern with emacs&#x27;s included terminal modes is that they used to run on interpreted elisp code that&#x27;s the reason alternatives such as vterm outperform it. But now that there&#x27;s native compilation I cannot help but wonder if there&#x27;s really that much of a difference

 I&#x27;m using the scheme layer in spacemacs. Here is my config
 scheme-implementations &#x27;(mit) geiser-mit-binary &quot;/path/to/mit-scheme&quot; geiser-default-implementation &#x27;mit 
 The person who closest ran into this issue I could find it seems like this person:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nnuapw/geiser_not_sending_correct_code_to_chicken_repl/
 They were using chicken scheme and it seems like some chicken scheme command fixed it.
 The closest analog I can think of with mit-scheme is there is a Setup.sh script to run (which I haven&#x27;t), though it seems this requires an already working mit-scheme compiler 😵‍💫
 I am able to run code fine in the geiser REPL 👍

                              <span>I want to create a (mode? package?) that behaves like a tui. The content should be read-only, but on key press I want to fetch data from a server, generate a collapsible/expandable tree from the result, be able to navigate the items and trigger further actions on the focussed items by more keypresses.
 I&#x27;m new to elisp, but data fetching, parsing etc. is not what gives me a headache - I&#x27;m familiar enough with Clojure to have a grap of lisps and willing to learn the language &quot;enough&quot;.
 The great unknown for me are the emacs internals on how to actually build the ui. Are there any introductions, tutorials or simple examples I can use to learn from? I could start with magit, which does all what I&#x27;d like incredibly well, but I feel like that&#x27;s a little over my head ;)
 Of course, best practices for fetching and parsing JSON are appreciated, too.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to write a function that returns an IO[Int] that might have a NOT_FOUND or DUPLICATE error. What would be the best way to write this function?
 Any blogs or videos that discuss about this topic? I&#x27;m confused onwhat the best practice in scala is. I hate java style exceptions and prefer error as values.
 If you can give me an example method or repo for doing this that would be nice.
 Edit: I&#x27;m not trying to make an app. I want to know what the usual way in scala is so that I can read scala codebases

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to scala and I am using vscode with Metals to code. However, when I create a project and import the build following the tip of Metals , Metals will be stuck on indexing even longer than 20min. It also cant navigate to the source of lib.
 Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. THX !

                              <span>I want to use Haskell for back-end (paired with Elm for front-end), but I&#x27;m not sure about committing to it for two reasons:
  
Haskell&#x27;s compiler error messages are confusing and feel unhelpful to me. I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Elm and Rust, and languages like Gleam seem to incorporate a similar style of compiler messaging I appreciate.
 I&#x27;ve heard that Haskell is difficult to maintain in the long run. When it comes to packages in my experience, cabal feels a bit less organized in comparison to package systems like Elm&#x27;s or Crate for Rust.
  
Are there solutions that could make Haskell a winning choice for a language in these aspects, or would I be better to go with something else?
 (As a side note, I admire the direction of Richard Feldman&#x27;s language Roc, but as it is still a developing language, I would not be keen to invest in that too much at the moment. If you think it&#x27;s worth it, maybe let me know.)

                              <span>So this is a little bit strange, but I cannot see any reason why this shouldn&#x27;t be possible, using various low-level GHC runtime functions etc.
 I want a function that looks like this:
 writeExecutable :: FilePath -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () 
 Calling writeExecutable fpath action on a Linux machine should create a Linux executable file at fpath that, when run, runs action as if it were main of that executable.
 To be a bit more specific regarding pre-existing state, I want
 writeExecutable fpath action args &lt;- System.Environment.getArgs System.Posix.Process.executeFile fpath args Nothing 
 and
 action System.Exit.exitSuccess 
 to be essentially equivalent, modulo the created file of course. (Bear in mind executeFile is UNIX exec, which does not create a new process but replaces the current process with new code).
 Why do I want writeExecutable? Because I wrote an interpreter and I want to turn it into a compiler for free.
 Does anyone know of any work that&#x27;s been done in this area (even in another language)?

                              <span>Is there a configuration to force the Ediff window to pop next to the main window instead of on top of it?
 The default position is inconvenient since the Ediff window will be covered if I click on the main window. I&#x27;m always having to move it aside so I can go back to keep looking at the diffs.

                              <span>One day, I tried to reflect on why I don&#x27;t really like EasyMotion-like packages (Avy, Ace-Jump, etc.). It was because they feel too intrusive to my flow - I want to go to a place almost mechanically, without thinking like, &quot;So I need to go to this &#x27;f&#x27; symbol, I should type &#x27;f&#x27;, then wait, read, and type the next symbols one after another&quot; 
 So, I tried to create a package that works the opposite way—you always go to the same place with the same keybindings. E.g., if you type M-s f u p, then you will always be in the top right corner.
 It might be slower at the start, but probably more mechanical, faster, and freeing your head in the end. 
 I wrote an example package and a training game, only to find out later that there exists the package I wanted, but which does it on a system level :) And it is https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/

                              <span>Hey!
 At work we use 2 indentation styles:
 void shortFunction(int arg1, int arg2, // ..., int argN, int argM) { // ... } void SomeClass::AndAnotherInnerScope::veryLongFunctionNameJustForFun( SomeOtherVeryLongTypeName arg1, int arg2, std::string arg3, ) { // ... } 
 Default tree-sitter indent rules can&#x27;t cope with that. They weally want to align all arguments to an opening brace, turning second function declaration into a mess.
 I have written my own indentation rule, maybe ugly, but it get the job done.
 It tries to indent first argument by 4 spaces if it is on its own line, and doesn&#x27;t move it at all otherwise, and everything else is aligned to it.
 (defun lazy/smart-indent (node parent bol &amp;rest _) (let ((first-real-child (treesit-node-child parent 1))) (if (or (not node) (treesit-node-eq node first-real-child)) (save-excursion (goto-char (treesit-node-start parent)) (back-to-indentation) (+ (point) 4)) (treesit-node-start first-real-child)))) 
 Then I had to create my own c-ts indentation style where I changed 2 rules: for argument lists and parameter lists to this:
 ((parent-is &quot;argument_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) ((parent-is &quot;parameter_list&quot;) lazy/smart-indent 0) 
 I don&#x27;t know a good way to do it other than copy existingy styles and patch in place.
 Hope it helps someone.

                              <span>I like vc as a lightweight alternative to magit. The problem is like this: I just commit all my changes to git, but I found a mistake in the message. I want to modify the log message, but the function vc-git-log-edit-toggle-amend seems to work only in the log-edit-mode buffer, which I don&#x27;t know how to invoke without committing changes. 
 Does anybody know a solution to this issue? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, everyone!
 I&#x27;m relatively new to Emacs, I&#x27;ve watched a few SystemCrafters videos, flipped through the documentation and tutorials. I&#x27;ve started writing my config, but it still looks far from what I want it to look like...
 So I&#x27;m here with a question: where can I find more variety of good cofigs for inspiration (and possibly for use)? The usual search on the net and on github gives mostly very outdated builds(
 For the context, I&#x27;ve been on Arch Linux for two years now, I&#x27;m switching to emacs from obidian, and I want to fit most of my activities into emacs: PKM (org-roam), Task manager, programming (C, Python, JS), etc

                              <span>Hi!
 Has anyone experienced this bug with poly-org and org-mode 9.7? 
 https://github.com/polymode/poly-org/issues/49
 I see the issue when the buffer glitches from top to bottom, with the cursor moving line by line too fast. It&#x27;s basically unworkable at this state. 
 My solution is to stay in 9.6 until there is a permanent solution for it. 
 Best.

 Could someone please explain why it makes sense that m needs to be a type constructor that takes one type argument, so of kind * -&gt; *? Why wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to have Monads where m is of kind *?

 Is there a way to gather all the knowledge in one course?

Some libraries will be buggy and some libraries are not a good fit in some situations. I also want a library that is simple but I don&#x27;t mind losing some simplicity for power(performance, capability etc). I want to make Conway&#x27;s game of life like automata based artwork. Where entities interact with each other and through emergence create complex structures, groupings and behavioral patterns. Based on my needs can someone point to me the best library, tool etc

 In this class definition. Where is the definition for the MonadError implicit?
 I can&#x27;t instantiate it with new MonadErrorExample[F](xa) I&#x27;m getting the error below
 No given instance of type cats.MonadError[F, String] was found for parameter ME of constructor MonadErrorExample in class MonadErrorExample

 I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to use MonadError here. Im new to scala and dont understand the syntax that well.
 Edit:
 I tried doing this
 class LiveVendors[F[_]] private ( xa: Transactor[F] )(implicit ME: MonadError[F, String]) 
 But Im getting No given instance of type cats.MonadError[F, String] was found for parameter ME of constructor LiveVendors in class LiveVendors in the apply method

 This post is not specific to Scala but I like this community so I ask it here.
 What do you think makes more sense for testing API status code and messages returned to the client? Unit testing (and mocking your services)?
 Or Integration testing to test with the real system?
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m an experienced Scala dev currently working through a consultancy for US clients. Lately I&#x27;ve been looking around for Scala jobs in LinkedIn and stuff, but it seems like all dev jobs are either US or Europe based.
 Does anyone have any tips for the job search taking that into account? As an aside, I&#x27;d rather not relocate right now, but I&#x27;m open to it in the future.

                              <span>I should just use old pinned stack resolver versions but I have a small compulsion to update the resolver versions of my many little projects to the latest LTS version.
 life is so much easier if I add allow-newer:true in each project’s stack.yaml file.
 It seems a little sloppy doing this, but are there specific reasons why this is a bad idea?
 thanks in advance for any advice.

 I&#x27;m not a programmer, am a writer looking to switch his primary digital writing process from Obsidian to Emacs, specifically Org Mode and Org Roam. I&#x27;ve been looking at a lot of intro guides and have done most of the in-built Emacs tutorial. I will keep on learning Emacs itself and the key commands and such as I go on, but today I wanted to get started actually using it (haven&#x27;t really worked the last few days as I spent time just reading about whether Emacs is worth it, then started to dip my toes into the water). Honestly I just wanted to make an org file to list the three dozen odd tabs I have open for various Emacs resources. N…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using text-scale-increase|decrease for awhile, but it only works on one buffer at a time, doesn&#x27;t affect the modeline, and so forth. Since most of the time I&#x27;m on very large monitors, I have the base font size set to be readable there, though sometimes I&#x27;m on the laptop and need it to scale down a little bit.
 I&#x27;ve done some searching for solutions but seems like the only ones I&#x27;ve come up with are from EmacsWiki (zoom-frm.el). This is fine, but also seems like it requires a lot of additional packages, also from EmacsWiki. 
 Anyone ever tried these solutions? I can go searching through EmacsWiki for all the dependencies and download them if I need to, but the Git repo is absolutely gigantic to try to get small amounts of packages so a bit of a pain. But if they&#x27;re the miracle cure, I&#x27;ll do what it takes.
 Also open to other packages that do the job. Just would like to control the text when the laptop is hooked up to dock with big monitors, and when it&#x27;s just a laptop.

                              <span>Hi, i&#x27;m new to emacs. I&#x27;ve been using vscode mainly and forgot that other IDE&#x27;s existed. I wanted to try and give emacs a go because I&#x27;ve heard good things about it. However, I&#x27;m a bit confused on how to get started with it. Anyone have any resources they recommend to get started? Thanks. Also, i&#x27;m wanting to learn C and use emacs as my IDE, I&#x27;m on MacOs. I previously learned javascript for around 8 months.

                              <span>The following settings help me compile my LaTeX documents via C-c C-c, and synctex works quite well with Skim on MacOS, with one exception. The LaTeX document compiles fine only when compiling from the root directory.
 Typically I have a main file acting as the &quot;scaffolding&quot; that imports various chapters/sections in separate files.
 main.tex └── sections ├── chapter-1.tex └── chapter-2.tex 
 Everything works as expected only if I compile from a buffer open with main.tex, but not with any of the chapter files in the sections directory.
  (use-package latex-mode :init (setq TeX-view-program-selection &#x27;((output-pdf &quot;PDF Viewer&quot;)) TeX-view-program-list &#x60;((&quot;PDF Viewer&quot; ,(concat &quot;/Applications/Skim.app&quot; &quot;/Contents&quot; &quot;/SharedSupport/displayline&quot; &quot; -b -g %n %o %b&quot;)))) :hook (LaTeX-mode . auto-fill-mode) (LaTeX-mode . variable-pitch-mode) (LaTeX-mode . tex-source-correlate-mode) (LaTeX-mode . reftex-mode) (LaTeX-mode . visual-line-mode) (LaTeX-mode . (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;TeX-view) (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t line-spacing 3 fill-column 80 TeX-command-default &quot;LaTeX Make&quot;))) :mode &quot;\\.tex\\&#x27;&quot;) 
 In main.tex, I have the following at the end of the document.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: t %%% End: 
 And in all other TeX files, I have the following.
  %%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex %%% TeX-master: &quot;../paper&quot; %%% End:

                              <span>I&#x27;m running pretty recent Emacs 29.3 PGTK build, with Org 9.7.4 and pdf-tools 1.1.0
 When exporting an org file as PDF with preview, Emacs creates a new window showing the PDF correctly but also switches the current org-mode buffer to show the same PDF file, as show in this screencast recording.
 It also seems to create a new frame showing the PDF if current frame is &quot;too small&quot;, which is not an issue for me.
 What annoys me is something switches the org-mode buffer to the PDF viewing buffer.
 I do not have &#x60;display-buffer-alist&#x60; rules regarding pdf-tools buffers.
 Have any of you seen this before?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I heavily use org-mode src blocks, normally with the ob-shell extension (sh, bash...), I previously worked in a MacOS system where the installation is a little complex, but can be done. Now, I recently got the opportunity to change systems so, I did.
 In a new Debian 12 installation, I have my Emacs installation and, when testing Src code blocks with *:async*, I noticed that my Emacs was still being blocked. This is a fresh installation.
 What I did:
 Run a src code block from the documentation that worked on the MacOS system, but didn&#x27;t in the Debian. Async should put an ID and then replace it:
  
+begin_src bash :session execute-asynchronously :async yes
 echo &quot;Execute session blocks in the background&quot;
 sleep 20
 echo &quot;Using the :async header&quot;
 +end_src
  
What happened:
  
In MacOS, an ID is put in the results, Emacs doesn&#x27;t get worked and after the 20 seconds I get the result. Works perfectly.
 
In Debian, Emacs gets blocked, with the message &#x27;Executing Bash code block at position 480&#x27;.
 
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Emacs -Q for a minimal example, same issue.
 
Searched for the ob-async github, nothing related and, no &#x27;requirements&#x27; I may have missed, or packages.
 
Searched the web for answers, apparently, this is not an issue that I can find logs about, and given that I am in a new installation, I&#x27;m at a loss at what else to check... 
 
 At this point, I&#x27;m not sure what do debug, since usage of src code blocks is a must and, the support of Emacs in Linux should be better as I understand, for example, I don&#x27;t have issues with gpg in Debian, while I couldn&#x27;t configure it on MacOS.
 Thanks!

 I really want to use this file as a drop-in replacement for use with use-package.
 Update: I&#x27;ve discovered :load-path so that answers the local-storage part

The servers were upgraded and some trivial maintenance needed to be done (bump the PHP version by +0.1). At least it would&#x27;ve been trivial if there had been any advance notification   While my mood is soured a bit by the experience, nothing was lost, merely inaccessible for a while, so that&#x27;s good news.</span>

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I have ADHD and it is a struggle to clean up my tasks or rather doing them, I mean I love how I can capture any idea and any to-do for a given project, but doing them ... that is a whole other story. 
 I recently read about how gamification can help people with instant feedback problems, to better work if their tasks are gamified. So my question is, is there a way in emacs, to implement like a point system for tasks, like when im capturing a to-do, give it an value or link the prio of the task to points and at the end of the month, get like a highscore or somehting?
 I was just wondering, if anyone did something like this and can help someone out who is really in need of something like this :D
 Thank you all, and a happy day to you all!

                              <span>As in the title i have been offered two different roles. This would be my first job after a bootcamp. 
 One is in Scala, it provides a high level of training and supervision and you work with big clients but my fear is whether Scala is future proof as someone beginning their career. 
 The other is in C# in a very small company. I hope the training will be good but there will only be 4 of us so we&#x27;ll have to see.

                              <span>Just wanted to see if anyone here could help me brainstorm a setup using org roam dailies to track my phyisical fitness / lifting goals. I&#x27;d like to use org roam dailies to track my body weight, some measurements, my workout lifts, and possibly progress photos sporadically as well. Org roam dailies stores information in a one-file-per-day system where each file is named after the date. I&#x27;m comfortable with the templating required to make information entry quick and easy in this system, and have already been tracking all of this on pen and paper for over a year. Organizing and inputting this information is something I&#x27;ve already figured out for myself. I can get somewhat close-ish to the functionality I&#x27;m looking for with org-ql, but can&#x27;t quite get the feedback I&#x27;d like displayed the way I want. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to be able to make line charts of certain tagged entries in the daily file and plot them over time. Certain things will not be in every single entry. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to accomplish this, I have not found the right plugin yet.
 Has anyone here ever used emacs to analyze information this way?

                              <span>I am trying to define a custom coding system for PETSCII, that currently uses a custom font with the appropriate symbols in a Unicode Private Use Block #xE000-#xE100. Eventually I&#x27;ll switch to the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, but for now...
 Finding useful documentation (or even code samples) for creating coding systems has been difficult - any pointers greatly appreciated. At present, the code below 1) decodes the PETSCII properly, but only 7-bits. Characters &gt;#x7F do not get translated. 2) Does not encode properly at all. Everything below #x7F gets translated to #x20 on writing.
 I&#x27;m being overly-explicit with some of this code, so excuse the verbosity. I did not include the entirety of &#x27;petscii-unicode-map&#x27; here for brevity, but it&#x27;s just a one-to-one mapping (and I&#x27;m hard-coding un-printable symbols ATM):
 (defvar petscii-unicode-map &#x27;((#x0 . #xE41D) (#x1 . #xE41D) (#x2 . #xE41D) (#x3 . #xE41D) [...] (#x3C . #xE03C) (#x3D . #xE03D) (#x3E . #xE03E) (#x3F . #xE03F) (#x40 . #xE000) (#x41 . #xE001) (#x42 . #xE002) (#x43 . #xE003) [...] (#xFC . #xE07C) (#xFD . #xE07D) (#xFE . #xE07E) (#xFF . #xE07F))) 
 Then I define a charset (which seems to work), an encode and decode translation-table, then the coding-system itself.
 (define-charset &#x27;petscii-standard &quot;PETSCII coding&quot; :dimension 1 :code-space [0 255] :map (seq-into (flatten-list petscii-unicode-map) &#x27;vector)) (defvar petscii-decode-table (make-translation-table petscii-unicode-map)) (defvar petscii-encode-table (make-translation-table (mapcar (lambda (v) (cons (cdr v) (car v))) petscii-unicode-map))) (define-coding-system &#x27;standard-petscii &quot;PETSCII coding system&quot; :mnemonic ?P :coding-type &#x27;charset :eol-type &#x27;mac :ascii-compatible-p nil :charset-list &#x27;petscii-standard :decode-translation-table petscii-decode-table :encode-translation-table petscii-encode-table) 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve dug through mule-conf.el and a few other bits of existing elisp, to no avail.

                              <span>I posted a week or so ago about a problem with consult-register-load. I get this error when using consult-register-load or consult-register-save. Both of these functions work but they do not display the little mini buffer info with the preview and the optional do what you mean stuff that makes consult-register so great.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) register-read-with-preview-traditional: Non-character input-event 
 This morning I took another swing at working on tracking down this bug. I put together a basic init.el file and ran emacs with -q -l test.el. Then I used M-x package-install-file. Directed it to the consult folder my regular emacs init file uses and found that consult-register-load works flawlessly. So I can eliminate the possibility that this was a bug in consult conflicting with the fact that I&#x27;m running emacs 30 or that emacs 30 it self had an issue.
 On the emacs wiki page about timers this line jumped out at me. Seems clear that it is the heart of my problem but I don&#x27;t know what to do to try and isolate or resolve it.
  
This predicate function returns non-nil if object is a timer.
  
I don&#x27;t know enough elisp to understand what that means. I&#x27;m also confused by what is going on in consult-register.el. Without a deeper understanding of what the offending functions in consult-register.el are doing. I don&#x27;t know how to proceed. Could someone explain it for me? Any tips on debugging this? Any and all suggestions welcome.

                              <span>This question is just to satisfy my curiosity. Looking in the site-start.d I notice that asy-mode.el is loaded at the start of the load process. As I understand it, this mode is for the editing of asymptote vector graphics files (something I never do) and so I was wondering why it is autoloaded so soon? Does anyone know? Is it required by another crucial package?

                              <span>What are they for? To cause emacs to be dependant on the distro version? I normally use the emacs package manager within emacs.

                              <span>Is there a function which i can use, to select specific git commit for git directory and browse its files in dired-like interface? 
 kinda like a history file browser of that git project
 best answer i found was https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24993868/how-do-you-list-tracked-files-git-ls-files-in-magit:
  
use M-&amp; git ls-files -z | xargs -0 -- ls -ld followed by M-x dired-virtual RET. The latter requires the dired-x library to be loaded.
  
problem with this, is when i open file from that buffer, i want it to open version of that file from that specific git commit, but it opens in current work dir

                              <span>org-transclusion-http is an extension for org-transclusion that lets you transclude content over HTTP. If you have pandoc installed on your system, org-transclusion will convert HTML documents to Org format and transclude them. It handles link anchors (&quot;fragments&quot;) in HTML as well as Org mode documents.
 After installing org-transclusion-http, run M-x org-transclusion-add-all in an org-mode buffer containing the following text:
 # Transclude ~org-mode~ document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.org#emacs]] # Transclude HTML document #+transclude: [[https://ushin.org/software.html#emacs]] 
 If you are connected to the internet and you have pandoc installed, the contents of those two files should asynchronously load, and the section of each document which matches the #emacs tag will be displayed in place of each #+transclude: link.
 org-transclusion-http is now available on NonGNU ELPA, so you can try it out on Emacs 28+ by running M-x package-refresh-contents then M-x package-install RET org-transclusion-http!

                              <span>I am, I believe, about to embark on a large Emacs project, described a little in this footnote[1]. Let&#x27;s call it Hode. In each hode-mode buffer, there will be some text, and parts of that text will correspond to objects in a TypeDB database. It will need to keep track of (among other things, surely) those correspondences.
 This means I&#x27;ll have to things in memory that are invisible to the user. The only kind of state I&#x27;ve manipulated previously in Emacs is the text itself.
 The only idea I&#x27;ve come up with so far is to define some global variables starting with &quot;hode-state-&quot;, and hope a user doesn&#x27;t clobber those names.
 Is that how it&#x27;s done?
 [1] It will use Emacs as a frontend to a TypeDB database, allowing users to maintain personal knowledge bases, like org-roam but with more structure.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a package that allows the execution and editing of Pharo &quot;scripts&quot; from Emacs and have come across shampoo-mode and Literate-Smalltalk (Github)
 Off the two literate-smalltalk appears to be the more up to date one.
 The links for shampoo-mode are
 project page in melpa,
 Shampoo mode for Emacs,
 Smalltalk image-side server that provides a remote access to an image,
 and Shampoo SqueakSource which seems to have more support for Pharo.
 
 Does anyone have some familiarity with these two packages?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to announce a new release of csound-expression on hackage. The CE is a music framework for haskell with focus on ease of use and feature rich as it rides on top of the powerful audio programming language Csound. It is a DSL to build Csound programs. So the library embeds Csound in Haskell. 
 It&#x27;s a bug fix release. Many algorithms in the low-level renderer csound-expression-dynamic were rewritten and fixed. In the previous version unforunately there were severe bugs in effectful expressions and in if-then-else blocks. But now they are fixed. 
 Also I&#x27;ve updated the library to include new Csound opcodes (audio processing units from 6.18 version).
 Happy music making with Haskell!
 About the future of the csound-expression:
 I&#x27;ve started the implementation of more tiny csound-core package. It offers a missing layer of low-level building of type-safe Csound expressions. In the previous version I&#x27;ve created lots of abstractions to make music making more pleasant for FP style. But this layering makes it kind of hard to debug rendered code. So I&#x27;d like to create a tiny imperative style core that will allow me to debug produced Csound code. And the rest of the code should be expressed in terms of this library. I&#x27;m not there yet. I&#x27;ve built the core library and it turned out very well. But now I need to rewrite FP abstractions on top of it. I&#x27;m not there yet. But I hope that gradually I will make it. 
 Also I plan to deprecate GUI features as FLTK was deprecated in Csound and it&#x27;s not packaged with Csound anymore. I think maybe it would be better to substitute them with JS+OSC.

                              <span>Does anyone else have this issue? If the cursor is on the far right side of a line which is folded you can&#x27;t move it to the left. It just says &#x27;beginning of line&#x27; at the bottom. 
 I&#x27;m using evil mode and it works when I&#x27;m in insert mode, but not in normal mode. So, maybe it&#x27;s related to evil? I tried to figure it out using chatGPT, but I couldn&#x27;t find a simple answer.

 [edit]
 Here is a screen video capture for those who want to see more in practice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;WUsgmQjMB6Q
 Some details about what I&#x27;m doing and shortcuts:
 00:00 : navigating and editing trees and list using navigation commands : https://orgmode.org/manual/Motion.html cycling (also works for src blocks) https://orgmode.org/manual/Global-and-local-cycling.html structure editing : https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html 00:16 : adding src block : C- s then type desired language (bash, python, ...) 01:00 : entering a src block editing mode, C-&#x27; then launching python console C-p and select desired code, then send it to console with C-r 01:17 : save and quit src block editing C-&#x27; 01:44 : add time stamp, C-u C-u C-c . 01:50 : cycle through todo-keywords C-c C-t 
 There are tons of other features that I don&#x27;t show, of course. I.e, embedding src block results and plots directly in org mode, jupyter-like style; isolating (sub)tree in buffer; tangle block code; calendar and time alerts; ... I&#x27;m far from exploiting the full potential of orgmode. But bit by bit, it progresses. I would say I usually learn (or rediscover ) one or two new shortcuts/feature a week, on average.
 Being able to I-search a keyword in my whole work is probably one of the most time saving feature of working in a single file. I can easily copy and look up for some code or notes I&#x27;ve written already.

                              <span>My manager informed me that I&#x27;ll be moving to a new team by the end of the year to work mainly with Scala. I have half a year to prepare to that and to be honest I&#x27;ve been avoiding this as the plague because I find Scala utterly complicated. I&#x27;ll dearly miss the simplicity of Go with errors as values and everything being async IO by default.
 My first question is: if you had to move from Go to Scala how it was your journey?
 Second, do you need to deal with exceptions everywhere like in Java doing Scala FP? And, how can I know which function will/can throw an exception? For example, in Scala is pretty normal to consume Java libraries, how can I know if I need to put a try/catch?

                              <span>I&#x27;m having issues with the Svelte lsp server, using emacs 29 w/ nativecomp and lsp-mode:
  
No highlighting or echo area information when hovering over stuff
 The autocomplete is weirdly sluggish 
 If something is lsp-renamed in a .ts file, the changes are not reflected in .svelte files, and vice versa
  
On the other hand, the typescript server is snappy and seems to work as expected, so now I suspect something may be amiss with the svelte server, and/or the lsp integration.
 The problem persists with the following simple config:
 (setq-default package-archives &#x27;((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)) load-prefer-newer t) (setq-default use-package-always-ensure t) (require &#x27;use-package) (use-package typescript-mode) (use-package web-mode :mode ((&quot;\\.html\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode) (&quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot; . svelte-mode)) :config (define-derived-mode svelte-mode web-mode &quot;Svelte&quot;) (setq web-mode-engines-alist &#x27;((&quot;svelte&quot; . &quot;\\.svelte\\&#x27;&quot;)))) (use-package company :config (global-company-mode)) (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp) :hook (((typescript-mode svelte-mode) . lsp))) 
 I hope someone can help out, I have no idea how to solve the problem. It seems few people develop svelte using emacs, so it&#x27;s hard to find information

                              <span>Is there a reliable way to set the weight of the default and italic faces dynamically?
 This isn&#x27;t working:
  (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :weight &#x27;light) 
 I tried with various fonts including Iosevka and Fira Code. I can set the font to &quot;Light&quot; using the &quot;Options | Set Default Font&quot; menu option. I want to do it in elisp though, to auto-toggle between light and regular depending on whether I&#x27;m using a dark or a light theme. (A lighter weight can look nicer with dark themes.)
 Curiously setting it to a bold weight does work. In one case the font I tried didn&#x27;t even have a bold weight, but Emacs synthesized it. Which is cool, but I can&#x27;t set it to a light weight using elisp.
 I tried using the :fontattribute and building a font spec string manually, but it was inconsistent. Sometimes it would take effect, other times not, and I couldn&#x27;t set the italicface to light and italic.

                              <span>I just added a simple plugin into my new dwm status bar (project page, github) to show the current clocked-in task of org mode. It helps concentrating on the current task and reminds to turn the clock off on time especially if you are doing your work outside of emacs.

                              <span>Hey fellow Emacs users!
 I’ve been working on a Bash script to simplify running Emacs and Emacsclient, and I wanted to share it with you all. Whether you’re frequently starting and stopping Emacs servers or switching between different profiles, this script can save you time and streamline your workflow.
 Here’s what it does:
  
Start an Emacs server with a specified profile or initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in terminal or GUI mode based on provided arguments.
 Kill running Emacs servers easily.
 List available Emacs server socket files.
  
How to use it:
 (assuming you added the script to your path)
 Help Message:
 ec -h 
 Displays the usage message with all available options.
 Script Version:
 ec -v 
 Shows the script version.
 Start Emacs Server with Profile:
 ec -p my-profile 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified profile.
 Start Emacs Server with Init Directory:
 ec -i /path/to/init-directory 
 Starts the Emacs server with the specified initialization directory.
 Run Emacsclient in Terminal Mode:
 ec -nw 
 Opens Emacsclient in terminal mode.
 Kill Emacs Server:
 ec -k 
 Kills the Emacs server processes.
 List Socket Files:
 ec -l 
 Lists the available socket files for Emacs servers.
 EmacsClient Options are supported
 All the regular emacsclient options are supported, so you can for example specify a different server to run it, for example:
 Create an emacs server in org mode
 emacs --bg-daemon&#x3D;demo-server --init-directory ~/init-directory/testing-org-config 
 use ec to open emacsclient with daemon named demo-server on line 23 of a file
 ec -s demo-server +23 ~/my-file.org

                              <span>The org mode habit tracker is really nice if you&#x27;ve ever used it. It has inspired me to try something similar. However, I don&#x27;t love the Emacs Lisp source code for it, or for org agenda, it looks somewhat involved and painstaking, I was wondering if there are any more high level libraries for creating images in an emacs buffer, in particular colored images (which presumably would have to implement the coloring through font lock? not sure if there&#x27;s a better way)

                              <span>Next month it&#x27;ll be my zettelkasten first anniversary. Thanks to this forum as well, this has been a very prolific year. Since I started my zettelkasten I have produced more than a thousand zettels, but now I&#x27;m struggling with their organisation.
My current workflow consists of: 
To solve my problem I wanted to slightly change my workflow:
Another concern of mine is about the &quot;granularity&quot; of a structure note. Eg. I have a structure note about philosophy that contains lots of zettels, and I want to subdivide it. Should I subdivide it for book, author or topic? I tend to have a topic-first approach, but maybe a book-first or an author-first approach could provide a simpler structure.</span>

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I&#x27;m trying to define a complex workflow where:
 I get My Github Issues
 #+name: gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe
 #+begin_src sh
 curl --header &quot;PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GitlabPersonalAccessToken}&quot; &quot;https://gitlab.com/api/v4/issues?scope&#x3D;assigned_to_me&quot;
 #+end_src
 I get a specific Issue via iid.
 #+name: getIssue
 #+begin_src sh :stdin gitlabGetIssuesAssignedToMe() :var iid&#x3D;&quot;&quot;
 jq --arg iid $iid &#x27;.[] | select(.iid &#x3D;&#x3D; ($iid | tonumber))&#x27;
 #+end_src
 I get the description of a specific one via iid too
 #+name: getIssueDescription
 #+begin_src sh :stdin getIssue(iid&#x3D;&quot;2495&quot;)
 jq &#x27;.description&#x27;
 #+end_src
 The problem is that, while this is working:
 +call: getIssue(iid&#x3D;&quot;2495&quot;)
 This is not working, as I&#x27;m still seeing the results of 2495 as in the getIssueDescription definition, I have &quot;2495&quot; still.
 +call:getIssueDescription(iid&#x3D;&quot;2498&quot;)
 I have also tried to put just iid so that I pass it, but no luck.
 So in this case, I want to change the variable of a chain of functions. I&#x27;m still trying but, haven&#x27;t found how...
 Thanks for looking into this specific issue!

                              <span>Hi, has anyone had success using &#x60;eglot-workspace-configuration&#x60; in a &#x60;.dir-locals.el&#x60; to pass configuration to Microsoft&#x27;s PyRight LSP? Am I doing something wrong below or is this not supported by either eglot or pyright?
 I am experienced with directory local variables and elisp, but beginner in pyright and eglot although I have read docs for both.
 ./foo.py:
 import sys import sys print(sys.argv) 
 ./.dir-locals.el:
 ((nil . ((eglot-workspace-configuration . (:python (:reportDuplicateImport t)))))) 
 &#x60;M-x eglot-show-workspace-configuration&#x60; output:
 { &quot;python&quot;: { &quot;reportDuplicateImport&quot;: true } } 
 In this simple case I expect the duplicate &#x60;import sys&#x60; in the python file to be flagged, but it is not, thus pyright is not using the config. It did use the config and flag the expected python line when I tried using the &quot;pyrightconfig.json&quot; file mentioned in pyright docs. So pyrightconfig.json file works, but in this case I want to use eglot-workspace-configuration. In fact I would like to use a hybrid of both (ie pyrightconfig.json checked into shared repo, and eglot-workspace-configuration on my local machine). Any tips? Thanks.

                              <span>Is Emacs good for developing React Native using TypeScript? I see that the front-end folks who use React Native and React with a million new features seem to lean more towards VS Code. Has anyone been developing extensively in React Native, connecting with emulators, dealing with those exotic CSS libraries (Like Tailwind or css modules) for React, etc., and had a good experience?

 Bonus: If you know of a way I can remove/modify the last tab-bar separator, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.
 Bonus: Remove last separator
 Would I need to modify the tab-bar format function? Do you have tips on inspecting (similar to using describe-face) the face of clickable/non-editable regions (such as the buffer name on the modeline)?
 Edit:
 I managed to achieve the final goal! Here is a screenshot:

 Here is my setup to reproduce it:

 Origin Emacs doc content: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.htm
 Original:
 &quot;Hooks are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs. A hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called on some well-defined occasion. (This is called running the hook.) The individual functions in the list are called the hook functions of the hook. For example, the hook kill-emacs-hook runs just before exiting Emacs (see Exiting Emacs).
 Most hooks are normal hooks. This means that when Emacs runs the hook, it calls each hook function…</span>

                              <span>I am trying out this new &#x27;pattern&#x27; for giving a typed interface on top of Akka actors. Here&#x27;s an example using classic untyped actors (based on https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html):
 import akka.actor.Actor class MyActor extends Actor { private var num &#x3D; 0 def receive &#x3D; { case &quot;incr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; num +&#x3D; 1 case &quot;decr&quot; &#x3D;&gt; num -&#x3D; 1 case &quot;get&quot; &#x3D;&gt; sender() ! num } } object MyActor { trait Trait { def incr: Unit def decr: Unit def get: Future[Int] } class Client(ref: ActorRef) extends Trait { import akka.pattern.ask override def incr: Unit &#x3D; ref ! &quot;incr&quot; override def decr: Unit &#x3D; ref ! &quot;decr&quot; override def get: Future[Int] &#x3D; (ref ? &quot;get&quot;).mapTo[Int] } } 
 This is inspired by the Erlang/Elixir style of having modules with a &#x27;client&#x27; portion that wraps the actor&#x27;s &#x27;protocol&#x27; ie the messages that it sends or receives, in a normal class with normal methods. This &#x27;client&#x27; class in Scala can also implement an interface which can be used by callers to abstract away the &#x27;implementation detail&#x27; of being an actor under the hood.
 val myActorClient &#x3D; new MyActor.Client(ref) myActorClient.incr myActorClient.decr myActorClient.get.map(println)

                              <span>In case no one else mentioned the $(\LaTeX)$ Knowledge package by Thomas Colcombet, I post it here. The package generates hyperlinks to definitions of terms defined in PDF documents. From the description:

  
As readers and reviewers, we have all been irritated, be it a bit or a lot, by not being able to find easily a key definition that was given sometimes hundred pages before (in a PhD thesis for instance). Using the knowledge package, every use of a concept becomes one click away from its definition (in the electronic version of the document), and an index with all its occurrences can be easily maintained (for the printed version of the document). The longer is the document, the more it improves the reader&#x27;s experience, but it already helps in conference papers.


A draft book written with the knowledge package is My First Category Theory Textbook by Ralph Sarkis.
Zettelkasten.de forum members might find the package particularly helpful for $(\LaTeX)$ mathematics documents, but mathematics isn&#x27;t the only application.</span>

                              <span>Hey all, I wanted to share a successful experience of turning my chaotic voice to text brain dump into zettels using a very simple method.
I was going through my journal which I use for fleeting notes and I found a brain dump that I wanted to process into zettels. I kept struggling with figuring out what is important enough for it&#x27;s own note and what belongs inside another note? Also, how do I want to break up these ideas where there are so many different ways I could do so?
I found a post response by @andang76 where he described the &quot;train of thought&quot; method of brainstorming he uses. Instead of using this to brainstorm, I applied this idea to processing a brain storm and it worked amazingly! I wanted to share it here because it seems like such an obvious and simple way to process your not…</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve been playing with FP libraries in Python and JavaScript.
 Because those languages do error handling with their native try catch mechanisms, most of the code I could see that make use of those FP library looks like the following.
 Isn&#x27;t it strange to mix both try/catch and the Either monad?
 I get it. It allows us to keep a full FP error handling core and logic.
 But the function implementations still make use of try catch. There are obviously no way around it.
 Those libraries can be used as FP wrappers.
 I guess the same applies in Scala when using Java libraries.
 What are you thoughts about it?

                              <span>Habits are displayed separately from other tasks on the TODO list. This is great, I like the consistency tracker, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to schedule it. Say I want to run every few days, but I also want to schedule my next run for 4pm on Tuesday. Is there a way to switch between two modes, one where habits are displayed in a block with their consistency graphs, the other where habits are displayed as ordinary TODO items with a repeating block?

                              <span>in neovim there are these plugins like flash.nvim or leap.nvim that instead of using relative line jumping or using the / key to search for your word, you can just trigger the plugin and type two characters from the word your are looking for, the plugin will then suggest another third character when you press it you will jump to your word.
 flash.nvim do other cool stuff like selecting a function or an expression by using treesitter (i really don&#x27;t know how it works really), like you would trigger the plugin in another way and then you will see characters suggestions to where to jump or select.
 is there something like this in eamcs? i&#x27;m sure there is but i didn&#x27;t know what to type in google to find anything
 thanks in advance

                              <span>Sometimes, when I am working on mixed language projects, I find that just inserting std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;we are here 1\n&quot;, std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;we are here 2\n&quot; works well. I copy the first print, then paste it where I want, increment the number, etc.
 Is there a way to write a function where every time I paste something, it increments the number for me? Optionally, does something like this already exist?
 p.s.: I have a snippet where I can increment the number under point, but that means navigating to the number and invoking that function. I would rather keep pasting the snippet and have the correct number show up. Probably a global counter which gets incremented on paste.

                              <span>I have started using Emacs 6 months ago and I love it! I use it for everything, from keeping notes, scheduling tasks to keeping bookmarks.
 Recently, after reading an article on using Emacs as a password manager through auth-info and epa packages, I started to implement it in my own workflow. 
 I wonder if this is seen as a security risk for some reason. I know Emacs is open source and packages are open source but there are many packages one uses and it is not possible to audit everything even if you knew Elisp to that extent (which I don&#x27;t). I am not using some obscure code but lots of some rather well known packages mainly related to org.
 I am somewhat worried that if I use epa package and decrypt some stuff in Emacs that there will be a small posibility that one of tens of packages is spying on me and may see the decrypted data. It seems like a case of paranoia to me but I&#x27;m curious to what your thoughts on this are.

 I&#x27;m using doom emacs config, with Emacs 29.1
 I have successfully enabled treesitter for typescript/tsx, javascript, and rust, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my treesitter config...
 Switching from go-mode to go-ts-mode drops syntax higlighting, but all of the other aspects of treesit mode, like treesit-explore-mode work. Interestingly, nil is highlighted in my .go files, but nothing else is.
 I know that typescript/tsx have a known bug that requires downgrading to a specific version, but I don&#x27;t know how anyone discovered that bug so that I can replicate and perhaps downgrade go as well.
 I&#x27;m pretty new to emacs, and have only really started scratching the surface of how to customize it to my liking, so tips on how to debug would also be super helpful!
 treesit config:
 (setq treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;((go &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go&quot;) (gomod &quot;https://github.com/camdencheek/tree-sitter-go-mod&quot;))) (setq treesit-font-lock-level 4) 
 maybe relevant go config?:
 (setq lsp-go-use-gofumpt t) (eval-after-load &#x27;flycheck &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;flycheck-mode-hook #&#x27;flycheck-golangci-lint-setup)) (add-hook! &#x27;go-mode-hook (which-function-mode 1) (flycheck-select-checker &#x27;golangci-lint) (add-hook! &#x27;before-save-hook #&#x27;lsp-format-buffer t t) (add-hook! &#x27;before-save-hook #&#x27;lsp-organize-imports t t)) 
 Let me know if there&#x27;s anything else I can include that might be screwing with treesitter :)

 https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi
 On my phone, I use Google Keep as a thoughtdump.. (for example: when im commuting and remembered about something important, i open my phone, click on the Gkeep widget, write stuff down, then turn off my phone)
 basically all the tasks and ideas that come to me are written down there. I also use google keep when im using the school computer and want to pass or receive information through my google account. I want to know if it&#x27;s possible for me to integrate this api to my emacs to improve my workflow. im not yet knowledgeable in cs to understand how APIs work :(

                              <span>I swear to god, it can&#x27;t be that hard. But apparently i&#x27;m to stupid for this.
 What i want is, to use ansible-language-server in yaml files and have ansible-lint hints, but no automatic formating. I&#x27;m trying to make this work with lsp-mode or eglot. I prefer lsp-mode for the breadcrumbs and how it&#x27;s configured, but if i get what i want out of eglot, that&#x27;s fine too.
 First of all, i remap yaml to yaml-ts-mode
 (use-package yaml-mode :mode (&quot;\\.yml\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9][0-9][0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9][0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) (&quot;\\.[0-9]\\&#x27;&quot; . yaml-ts-mode) ) 
 The lsp-mode setup i tried looks like this at the moment:
 (use-package ansible :hook (yaml-ts-mode . ansible)) (use-package lsp-mode :custom (lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (lsp-yaml-server-command &#x27;(&quot;ansible-language-s…</span>

 As you can see before I ran emacsclient there was already existing emacs frame. According to the help:  -r, --reuse-frame Create a new frame if none exists, otherwise use the current Emacs frame 
 What am I doing wrong? Why emacsclient cannot reuse the frame?

                              <span>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know why only now, after years of using Emacs, I have realized that I have never attempted to figure this out, in many regards, quite important feature of any text editor.
 I want to find a good, predictable way to jump between places. Not just within a single buffer or same window - between windows, tabs and frames. 
 So this is what I want:
  
I would be typing something in one buffer (matter of fact I&#x27;m typing this very message in an Emacs buffer), let&#x27;s call it t1/w1/b1, okay?
 
Then I would move the cursor to the top of the buffer, to fix a mistake.
 
Then for whatever reason I would switch to another window, right next to my current window&amp;buffer - let&#x27;s call it t1/w2/b2, and then type some other stuff.
 
Then, I would switch to another tab (I&#x27;m using tab-bar-mode) where it finds t2/w1/b1
 
 Now, is there a way to:
  
Pressing a key to jump to the previous tab, window, and buffer? So in my case pressing the key would take me first to t1/w2/b2, pressing it again to t1/w1/b1 at the top of b1, and then if I press again - to the end of it.
 
Seeing and using the jumps history in the minibuffer.
 
 Is there a good package that works this way? Emacs has powerful position system, how is something like this is not a thing? Or maybe I just don&#x27;t know about it yet? 
 Doom Emacs uses better-jumper, but it works within a single window or buffer, it can&#x27;t take you across different windows, tabs and frames. And because of that, it feels super unpredictable, I never know where better-jumper-jump-backward would take me next.
 There are Evil marks and built-in Emacs markers, but they also don&#x27;t seem to have cross-window-tab-frame functionality.
 What is you recommendation for this problem?

This post might seem unnecessary to alot of u and i agree but when u experience the pain of many years of terrible docs for different technologies u truly learn to appreciate this stuff.

                              <span>TL;DR: any quick and dirty way to say… convert this org buffer with eMacs faces into the html equivalent? (In terms of look). I’m tempted to just share screenshots but would lose links and people would think me mad.
 —-
 I’m exporting to html because I’ve failed at setting up pdf export on my Mac. I use code blocks to get something like a breakout text block… but all white space seems to get eaten and it just gets very “wall of text”. And the text blocks are full screen/scale but the text wraps at my eMacs width. 
 Can I get it to just export a look like the eMacs faces? Italics get broken in quote boxes. Newlines without an extra line get wrapped into a wall. Etc etc, I’m sure we’re all familiar with this. 
 I eventually want to learn how to format correctly and get it all working… but I don’t want to delay sharing my doc for the week that will probably take me to figure out. ;)
 Any pro tips appreciated. Is html just the wrong way and I need to bite the LaTex bullet? It was crazy how funky it seemed to be to get it going. 
 Thanks.

 I thought everything somehow fixed itself.. but it started happening again. 
 This time however, I was able to get some crash logs and it looks like it is related to corfu?

                              <span>Hey Emacs fellows,
 It is my first post here, and i want to introduce the devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge project! This feature brings auto-completion to your Emacs setup within development containers, using the powerful lsp-bridge.
 What is it?
 The devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge automates the setup of language servers supported by lsp-bridge inside your devcontainers. By using Nix packages, it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier than ever to get started with Emacs and language servers in a containerized development environment.
 Key Features:
  
Auto-completion in devcontainer
 Support for multiple languages
  
Check out the repository for more details.

                              <span>I keep noticing that some Emacs users seem to not be familiar with keyboard macros, and even those that are familiar with them aren&#x27;t always familiar with the fact that there&#x27;s a counter facility associated with them so you can do things like giving every #define in a block of C code a distinct associated value or what have you in a few keystrokes.
 Multiple cursors are sometimes the right tool, but some of the things people do with them are probably better done with keyboard macros. If you don&#x27;t know about them, you should.

                              <span>Using straight.el I installed the newest version of org-mode from the tecosaur repo and I also installed pdf-tools. Whenever I tried viewing a pdf for the first time, I would get a void variable error for org-format-latex-header. Even though this is declared as an obsolte variable in org-compat.el, its replacement is not defined at the time the pdf is opened. I am not sure what is the canonical way to solve this. Should I just (require &#x27;org-latex-preview) in my init.el or is there a cleaner approach like passing some parameter to use-package?

                              <span>Hello Emacs Community!,
 I&#x27;ve going around my head and investigating as for a way to finally implement all my email setup in Emacs, which is:
  
3 Gmail accounts that I can implement with .authinfo and application passwords
 
2 Gmail account that I can&#x27;t
 
1 Microsoft Exchange account where I can&#x27;t use app passwords and, when configuring davmail, I needed authorization (actually asking for it)
 
 My problem is the latter two, where in case I got lucky and manage to fight my case and get my app password in the Exchange one, I would still will be unable to use the 2 Gmail accounts that don&#x27;t have application passwords activated.
 I could configure Davmail for exchange, now, not sure about the other two gmail accounts... I think davmail only works for Microsoft.
 Is there, perhaps something like davmail that I can use across all of my accounts?, since application passwords aren&#x27;t considered secure, in the case these are eliminated, I wouldn&#x27;t want my accounts to stop working...
 How complicated would be to implement this? (elisp developer), is there perhaps a protocol that is not implemented in Emacs?, something like ouath2 which I think has a package. How technically complicated is this and, how much would it take?. Or is there perhaps, a different more updated way that I don&#x27;t know of?.

                              <span>Running EMACS 29.3, I get the messaage package cl is deprecated on start (been going on for a while--it was deprecated in 28 or 27, IIRC). I believe this is associated with the [simplenote2](https://github.com/alpha22jp/simplenote2.el) package. I use one of it&#x27;s functions (creating a note), I get the message format: Symbol’s function definition is void: math-fixnum. If I create a note on the browser, I can edit it in EMACS to my heart&#x27;s content. I just can&#x27;t make a new one. 
 My suspicion, as I said, is it&#x27;s related to the cl package. I was going to try to dig into the code to see if there is a fix, but I wanted to ask before digging into that: is there some standard fix/best practice/shim that can be applied to fix this?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 My talk &quot;Functional Programming: Failed Successfully&quot; from LambdaConf 2024 is now published online.
 This is my attempt to understand why functional languages are not popular despite their excellence. The talk&#x27;s other title is &quot;Haskell Superiority Paradox.&quot;
 Beware, the talk is spicy and, I hope, thought-provoking.
 I&#x27;ll be happy to have a productive discussion on the subject!

 Are there any tools or resources that can help me get really good at it? Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for MOOCs or courses similar to the ones from the University of Helsinki. Any recommendations for the best ways to learn and master Scala would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. I&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Here is a report on the ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK and why I&#x27;m here:
The difference between who I am now and who I was five years ago is largely due to how I&#x27;ve spent my time along the way.

How does my note-taking tie into my writing? More intimately, how do ideas get into my thinking? They do so in two ways: fast and slow. The adage, &quot;Nothi…</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t fully use all parts of a zettelkasten but I am trying to get better at making my notes atomic. This was one of the first notes I ever wrote but the more i learn about zettelkasten the more I think that this is more of a mini-essay. I think many of my notes are more of mini-essays rather than individual zettels. If so, how would I turn this into individual zettels? How do I know how far to break something down and when does it get too much? Sometimes I feel like every sentence could be turned into a zettel.
Side note: I use links instead of tags for categorization - not sure if I love this method but it&#x27;s whats been working for a bit.

With the availability of far more powerful free and open source NLP models, has any attempt been made to either replace (don&#x27;t think there are any models that are GPL freindly, yet) or supplement Eliza on emacs (a.k.a M-x doctor)?

                              <span>I work on a lot of parallel features in the same very large git repo, so I&#x27;ve been making use of git worktrees and treating each worktree as a separate projectile project. Usually the worktree is named ~/reponame/feature_im_working_on. 
 However, because the repo is so big, and because the build cache takes so long to initialize, I don&#x27;t want to create a new worktree every time I start a new feature. mv&#x27;ing the worktree unfortunately breaks the build cache, for reasons of stupid build system that&#x27;s out of my control. What I&#x27;d really like to do is have ~/reponame.real/a ~/reponame.real/b ... and symlink those to ~/reponame/my_feature. But projectile and project.el notice that its a symlink and name the project ~/reponame.real/a. I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to prevent this behavior, and just use the symlink as the project name, and I haven&#x27;t found it. Has anyone else done something like this with their workflow? Or do I need to hack the project.el source and add this?

                              <span>I started using Eshell a few months ago and by and large I like it. I really like having eat-eshell-mode enabled, which means if the command I run wants to be interactive, I get a terminal emulator right there! So seamless! So nice!
 One area I wish could be smarter is completions. I use corfu and cape; I would love it if Eshell were super smart about completing commands, sub-commands (like with git), control flags, etc. I have some configuration around this, but I&#x27;m not happy with it.
 How do you configure Eshell and your completion-at-point mechanisms to be as smart as possible?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am trying to establish a LaTeX workflow, and ideally would like to use pdf-tools (or something similar) because well, everything works that way all within emacs. However, the rendered pdf doesn&#x27;t feel quite snappy and fast as a standard pdf viewer like Zathura or even firefox&#x27;s pdf viewer.
 Is this a known issue with pdf-tools, or is there something that I would have to change in the config to make it work seamlessly with emacs and auctex?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been away from emacs for a while but am helping a user get access to a package archive (melpa) and the only way out is through an authenticating proxy. I found a discussion on stackoverflow suggesting a config like this: (setq url-proxy-services &#x27;((&quot;no_proxy&quot; . &quot;\(localhost\|10.*\)&quot;) (&quot;http&quot; . &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot;) (&quot;https&quot; . &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot;)))
 (setq url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage (list (list &quot;proxy.com:8080&quot; (cons &quot;Input your LDAP UID !&quot; (base64-encode-string &quot;LOGIN:PASSWORD&quot;))))) 
 (I can find similar examples elsewhere also)
 ... the url-proxy-services seems to work, as I can see the request hit the proxy. But the url-http-proxy-basic-auth-storage seems to not work, as the proxy logs include a DENY with &quot;Authentication required&quot;, and when I look at the traffic with the request to the proxy, it doesn&#x27;t include any authentication.
 Has anyone had any success getting this working? It&#x27;s emacs 27.2 on OpenSuSE.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi. I am using borg for package management for my Emacs config. I&#x27;ve been thinking about incorporating some TDD into my Emacs config. I want to try out Ecukes, but it doesn&#x27;t seem too compatible with Borg. Whenever I try to run &#x27;eask install-deps&#x27;, it gives the error &quot;Package not installable &#x27;ecukes&#x27;; make sure the package archive (source) is included&quot;. I managed to trace the error to the following function in eask in lisp/_prepare.el:
 (defun eask-package-installable-p (pkg) &quot;Return non-nil if package (PKG) is installable.&quot; (assq (eask-intern pkg) package-archive-contents)) 
 Since I use Borg, I don&#x27;t appear to be setting the variable package-archive-contents. What would be the right way to go about solving this issue?

                              <span>Consult has recently stopped displaying the register list when I use my keybinding for consult-register-load. The function still works if I remember the binding I tied to the register but I get this error if I wait for the mini buffer to populate and the preview to start.
 Error running timer: (void-function nil) 
 Anybody have any ideas? I looked at the register.el file but I&#x27;m not good enough with elisp to do more than guess at what is causing the problem. I&#x27;ve included my consult settings from my init file in case I&#x27;m missing a setting. It worked for months without but I&#x27;ve recently begun pulling from the github to stay more up to date on my emacs packages. I don&#x27;t remember if this started after an update.

                              <span>Hi, I have some experience with Java Springboot &amp; wanted to improve on that. But my project got changed which has data pipelines work now. (Azure Databricks pipelines) Should I ask for release in the project? Or side by side prepare for interviews? I am in service based company &amp; fearing of going to bench. Please suggest.
 Thanks in advance.

 On the previous stream we got paging done in Scala.today and this week we&#x27;ll try to get the basic set of functionalities complete for prod deployment.
 If you have any questions, suggestions, complaints regarding Scala, Scala tooling, infra as code tool Besom, VirtusLab&#x27;s work on Scala and such, fire away in the chat, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer anything.

                              <span>I have a question regarding how to handle enums on a code that is deployed on different situations.
 Think of &quot;region/State&quot; field, they are of course fixed (at least in the short term) but different on each country. I can see two different ways to handle it:
  
Manually change the file with the enum, simple
 
Keep them on a database and use set to generate the code automatically, cam make people nervous with this self-modifying code thing
 
 What would be the preferred approach in Scala?
 Thanks

What is the easiest way to parse a [String]? I am having trouble figuring out, e.g., how to (1) run the parser, and (2) how to consume an individual String or a [String] from the input.
 More generally, what is the easiest way to use Parsec when the input is a list of a Token type instead of a list of Char?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finished reading Learn You a Haskell and I&#x27;m currently following a tutorial on monad transformers I found online. The exercise is implementing MaybeT.
 The author makes MaybeT an instance of MonadTrans as follows:
 instance MonadTrans MaybeT where lift &#x3D; MaybeT . (liftM Just) 
 I&#x27;m a little confused initially, so I open my code editor and get the type annotation for lift, which makes it clear instantly: it takes a value in the base monad to produce a value in the transformed monad, with that same base and Maybe as a precursor.
 So I implement it on my own:
 lift :: (Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; m a -&gt; MaybeT m a lift x &#x3D; MaybeT $ do x&#x27;  x 
 And then the thought occurs to me that lift could be implemented generally, like so:
 lift x &#x3D; MonadT $ do return  x 
 But then the author asks, as an exercise: why is it that the lift function has to be defined separately for each monad, whereas liftM can be defined in a universal way?
 So I know I must&#x27;ve gotten something wrong somewhere here; but where exactly? Is it that using return makes sense in the context of Maybe, but it doesn&#x27;t in some other monad?

                              <span>I am a complete newbie to emacs/doom emacs. Trying to migrate from vim and build a org mode note taking workflow.
 These auto suggestions/completions are very annoying. I don&#x27;t understand emacs enough (yet). How would I disable these? In the future, how could I go about looking for help about visual elements like this from within emacs?
 Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/8V8MOs7
 Edit for more info:
 I did think it was coming from the company package so I have it commented out and still the completions continue to show. Here&#x27;s my init.el snippet: https://imgur.com/CmKvnD0, and here&#x27;s the output of M-x describe-mode which shows that company is active: https://imgur.com/a/m1c407M (this is after doom sync, full restart of emacs)
 Apparently M-x company-mode toggles it and then the suggestions go away, but that only seems like a local change. Could you help me understand what is happening?

 Hello, I recently wanted to try emacs, last night it worked great, but today I got the blue screen out of nowhere and when I wanted to open emacs again I got that, should I reinstall it or what is the problem? By the way, I&#x27;m super new, beyond reading the documentation they recommend

                              <span>The math symbols are (way) smaller than the default font.
 Recently, I&#x27;ve been fighting with org-pretty-entities to customize some behaviors. My latest endeavor is &quot;why the UTF-8 character for math symbol are so small compared to the default font?&quot;. FYI, this happens in org-mode and LaTeX-mode.
 When looking into the characters itself, some clues I&#x27;ve gathered:
  
the faces applied are font-latex-math-face and font-latex-sedate-face. Unfortunately, changing the height in any of those cause other parts to be comically large (math-face is also applied to the rest of the math block, sedate-face is applied to any latex command like \underbar).
 
the font used to display those characters is mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 despite my default supporting it (both mono and variable pitch are nerd font).
 
 Right now I am mostly suspecting the issue is the font that is being applied, but I am not sure how to fix it. Even when using (set-face-attribute &#x27;font-latex-math-face nil :family &quot;NotoSans Nerd Font&quot;), it keeps using the aforementioned font.
 Actually, the describe-char gives me the following info (some kinda of character composition? Not really that expert in Emacs):
 display: composed to form &quot;\alpha&quot; (see below) Composed with the following character(s) &quot;alpha&quot; by the rule: (?α) The component character(s) are displayed by these fonts (glyph codes): α: mac-ct:-*-Apple Symbols-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#xA1E) 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 I like to keep my non built-in package count very, very, lean. I understand that there are probably some practical benefits to using these programming language specific modes but I just don&#x27;t like the idea of picking a package for every programming language, learning all the complexities of each of them, and using LSP, and using tree-sitter. It just seems like a lot.
 I also don&#x27;t know how to autmatically enable LSP and tree-sitter when editing certain file types without hooking into these modes.
 I&#x27;m very new and just looking for some Emacs wisdom. Thank you.

                              <span>Some post from a couple of days ago made me try out emacs 30, and there is a very noticeable difference in performance. Everything is much snappier now. And it&#x27;s not even native-comp; I can feel the difference even without it.
 FWIW I&#x27;m using emacs-plus on mac, but this seems to be noticed by others too. E.g. https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-06/msg00012.html
 Applause to our devs who support such amazing software on their free time!

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning a new language. Keen to use spaced repetition as an aid. Emacs/org editing is a requirement, but would also like to complement with an iOS app.
 What are you favorite Emacs spaced repetition packages/flows? Do they also extend to iOS?
 Regardless of whether or not your workflow extends to mobile, what&#x27;s your favourite Emacs package for spaced repetition?
 Currently playing with org-drill and anki-editor to get a feel for these too. Any other I should consider?

                              <span>Please skip this reading, it&#x27;s just a message about me and Emacs.
 I was ready to write a rant.
 Then I gave up and started to breathe and think.
 I&#x27;ve been an Emacs user for a couple of years and have learned a lot but I&#x27;m still pretty dissatisfied.
 But dissatisfied with what? Not about Emacs. Not about the packages I use. The truth is that I&#x27;m dissatisfied with myself using Emacs, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy, that&#x27;s the sad truth. Emacs is not for lazy people like me. Emacs is a demanding teacher. It requires you to be focused, focused and disciplined. So I decided to completely change my approach. I stopped compulsively trying any piece of package I found on Reddit. I decided to read and study Lisp, starting from the basics, the commands and the basic architecture.
 My frustration is driven by my ignorance. Above all.
 Emacs isn&#x27;t for me when I think I can find a baked solution on satckoverflow.
 Emacs is not for me if I expect to have every package well documented in detail.
 Emacs isn&#x27;t for me when I think one package can solve all my problems.
 Emacs is not for me if I think Emacs can organize chaos in my head.
 But I also found the main problem in Emacs: it causes dependency.
 Once you try it you can&#x27;t stop using it, you can&#x27;t stop thinking about it, you can&#x27;t stop trying to find new solutions. Learning Emacs must be done in an organized and programmatic manner.
 I&#x27;m not a developer, nor a programmer, I&#x27;m mostly an aspiring programmer (I use R and a little Python), but the way Emacs forces me to stay focused on what I&#x27;m doing, to organize my notes, my documents, my GTD is something new and somehow irreplaceable.
 Thank you all. Thanks Emacs. And sorry for the unnecessary message.

                              <span>I have enabled pop in my gmail account and have the following in my .gnus:
 (setq gnus-select-method &#x27;(nnnil &quot;&quot;)) ;; Define how Gnus is to read your mail. We read mail from ;; your ISP’s POP server. (setq mail-sources &#x27;((pop :server &quot;pop.gmail.com&quot; :port 995 :user &quot;my@mail.com :stream ssl))))) ;; Say how Gnus is to store the mail. We use nnml groups. (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods &#x27;((nnml &quot;&quot;))) 
 When I launch gnus, I am prompted for my password, and then dumped into an empty buffer with a minibuffer message saying &quot;no news is good news&quot;. I get the same behavior using the wrong password too, so I am not even sure if it is trying to connect to the server. Those options in my mail-sources are what is given to me by Gmail when I look into their &quot;Configuring your email client&quot; instructions. How do I debug this?

                              <span>I enjoy the code-writing experience Emacs and the community provides. But this is the 8th year since I joined the party and I still feel overwhelmed. Usually when I write code, random &quot;problems&quot; still show up here and there, even I have &quot;solved&quot; a lot in the past.
 By &quot;problem&quot;, I mean issues, warnings, behaviors that don&#x27;t work the way I like, configurations I have to choose and balance, even functionalities I used to know but forget their shortcuts, function names or triggers.
 If I ignore those &quot;problems&quot;, they will just stay there and continue to popup every now and then until I upgrade the whole packages and hoping those problems get automatically solved.
 If I solve them, it usually take some time which will interrupt my normal workflow. This is annoying.
 There are two solutions I can think of:
  
Either &quot;problems&quot; get fewer as time goes (which is usually not the case). or
 I get control over Emacs and can solve every &quot;problem&quot; really quickly.
  
In terms of option 2, what can I do? Should I
  
get better at common lisp?
 read more packages&#x27; source code?
 remember more built-in elisp functions?
 write a package from start?
 just spare a fixed amount of time fixing Emacs problem every day?
  
What&#x27;s your experience and solution? What&#x27;s your advice to people like me?

                              <span>basically the title. I&#x27;ve searched for it everywhere but with no avail. I like how emacs NANO has the modeline on top, although I could not find any way to do it with other modelines.
 I&#x27;m using doom emacs btw if that&#x27;s important

                              <span>I have been an Evil user for a while, but I am playing around with meow and it seems extremely interesting. However, there are a couple of Evil&#x27;s functionalities that are essential to me, and I could not find an obvious equivalents in meow. These are:
  
Jump lists (C-oand C-ishortcuts in Evil)
 Jump to definition
  
I am wondering if you guys have any insight on how to get such functionalities in meow.

                              <span>I have corfu and cape installed, but this only gives me some very basic completions. I would like, for instance, to have type info (whether a completion is a function, variable, or macro, etc), or for the ui to only suggest valid completions (not variables out of scope), some linting would be nice too where it indicates potential problems. Essentially, i am looking for an lsp experience for elisp

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently learning Haskell, but I find it difficult to understand the discussions within the Haskell community. Despite having substantial experience in general programming, I&#x27;m worried about whether I&#x27;ll ever be able to follow their conversations at a high level. Is this a common experience? For context, I&#x27;m pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

                              <span>In lsp-mode (or any other Emacs cases), I can use lsp-rename to rename a var/id, all references being updated automatically. Now I want to modify a function&#x27;s signature, e.g. adding an argument, in a way similar lsp-rename. Anyone knows how to to that, thanks.

                              <span>I have been using Obsidian / VSCode for many years now, but wanted to &#x27;get the hang of&#x27; Emacs to see why it is regarded as the most efficient way to manage code/info. The last time I used Emacs was in the 90&#x27;s but I don&#x27;t recall it being extra special at the time. (I probably wasn&#x27;t looking at all the features though)
 I am feeling good about Emacs now - I find myself working pretty easily with it, and am finally getting the hang of some of the shortcuts (it was really difficult at the start to not C V )
 CSV editing is great - columns can be aligned easily
 Dired mode is the real bonus - apart from the initial oddness of clicking a folder and having it open in the next buffer, I am now loving it. It is really quick to jump around and edit multiple files, and the directory list itself is great to copy quickly from (making a lot of tiny CSV files). The marking of files via regexp is fantastic, and there are so many little things that make working just that bit easier.
 So, I have uninstalled VSCode and am using Emacs full time for coding now (still using Obsidian - the markdown links are a bit borked so I need to do some scripting to convert them so they work nicely)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just getting started with learning emacs and I&#x27;ve been watching some of SystemCrafters to start building my config to understand this software better. 
 I installed the GUI version on windows 10 and one thing I have trouble figuring out is how to make the cursor position visible as in the lower part of this image which is taken from a screenshot of &quot;Emacs from Scratch&quot; 
 I would like to have something similar so I can find my position in the buffer. Unless I type something I do not know where in the line my cursor is (as in the upper part of the image)
 So far I only managed to set the hl-line-mode on so I can at least find the line I&#x27;m in, but several things I tried to put in my config that I found in various forums led me to believe that I perhaps do not know the correct terminology for this setting.
 I tried
 (setq-default cursor-type block) 
 and 
 (setq make-pointer-invisible nil) 
 and tried changing the cursor color, but it didn&#x27;t make it visible. 
 Any help would be appreciated, I&#x27;m sorry for asking such a basic question but I could not figure it out with googling it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Coming from a vim background, it is pretty straightforward to specify text wrapping of certain number of characters for specific filetypes. Is there a way to achieve this in emacs?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have released version 0.6.0 of Kele, the spritzy Kubernetes management package for Emacs. Changelog here.
 Note: This release bumps the minimum required version of Emacs to 29.
 This release introduces the notion of kind-specific keybindings. Some resources have special &quot;actions&quot; associated with them, e.g. &quot;restarting&quot; Deployments or getting logs from Pods. kele-resource now has a dedicated column for these keybindings that, when defined, are dynamically filled in based on the selected resource kind. For now, there is only one resource-specific keybinding—R to restart a Deployment. Try s-k deployments to check it out.

 In addition, individual bindings within kele-resource are disabled based on your permissions for the given context/cluster. In other words, if you don&#x27;t have permission to list Pods within the selected cluster, Kele will disable the l keybinding with a helpful message.

 Lastly, this release fleshes out the resource listing functionality. Some highlights:
  
In addition to opening a resource from the list view (RET), you can now also delete/kill the resource at point with k;
 The list view now shows the owner resource(s) for every list item; hitting RET with your cursor over the owner cell will instead open the owning resource;
 The list view now supports listing across all namespaces.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you&#x27;d like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Enjoy!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve noticed that recording a macro when having a special input-method enabled (say TeX) and using isearch, the macro is terminated by ringing of the bell. I&#x27;ve found that one of the functions called is isearch-with-input-method (isearch-x.el), and it calls exit-minibuffer; commenting out that call, even though some things behave funny, at least doesn&#x27;t terminate the macro. It also works if I disable the input-method temporarily, then use isearch, and simply turn it back on if I have to input something specific to the input-method; that however rules out any searching for special characters, which isn&#x27;t ideal at all. Is there a way to remedy this? It seems strange to me that one shouldn&#x27;t be able to record a macro simply due to using an input method... Help greatly appreciated! I&#x27;m using Emacs 30 from homebrew-emacs-plus.

See the clipped video. I have been trying to search about how to do it. Does anybody know? Also, I have been trying to learn how to « learn » more effectively. This is a perfect example of something I see is possible but I don’t know how to search emacs docs for it. Would you mind sharing your usual flow of search?
 Thanks people and have a nice week end !

                              <span>Hello. My apologies if this has been addressed elsewhere. I am facing the following problem: I have a structure note on Financial Reporting, and I am trying to find an efficient way to display all the contents of the links of that structure note in a single document. I currently do that by manually opening notes and copy pasting their title and contents in the end of the file. I would really appreciate that if someone could point me to a less-manual way of doing that!</span>

                              <span>How good is this book? I also want to know - Maybe I should be thoroughly familiar with some advanced Haskell concepts? Maybe there&#x27;s some issue with the resource? Maybe there are better resource or I should pick a different approach? People who have used this book. Can you share your experience.

 Following the g8 template they provide https://github.com/novakov-alexey/flink-scala-api.g8, I can run the included WordCount program using sbt run. 
 However, when i try to package the code into a fat JAR (using sbt assembly) and submit to a local flink instance, flink reports the following errors
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 in the code above I am trying to connect to an sqlite database using doobie and retreive the data from a table
 the table is &quot;create table person (ID integer primary key autoincrement, nameperson text, birth DATE not null);&quot;
 but when I try to execute I get an error Caused by: java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: &quot;1997-08-03&quot; does not match (\p{Nd}++)\Q-\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q-\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q \E(\p{Nd}++)\Q:\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q:\E(\p{Nd}++)\Q.\E(\p{Nd}++)
 note: if I remove the date field it works perfectly and the data is retrieved successfully
 how to retrieve a Date column and parse it correctly
