 $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git $ cd emacs &amp;&amp; ./autogen.sh $ ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-librsvg checking for X... no checking for AppKit/AppKit.h... no configure: error: The include files (AppKit/AppKit.h etc) that are required for a Nextstep build are missing or cannot be compiled. Either fix this, or re-configure with the option &#x27;--without-ns&#x27;. 
 I was wondering for advice on how to fix this. I began this journey because my brew install --cask emacs was giving me a invalid image type: svg error, and now, I am trying to obtain the best version of emacs I can for MacOS Ventura 13.3.1. Any information or advice is appreciated. Additional performance and good options to --configure are also appreciated.
 I do have the Appkit.h on my machine. I found it in Finder.

Do you have good configurations for JavaScript developers or users who don&#x27;t like to memorize or both?

 ChatGPT provided me a few organization maintained configs (below), but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any of them so far. Could it be that these are not publicly available (anymore)? 
  
Here are a few examples of organizations that maintain Emacs configurations for their employees: 1. Google: Google has a large and active community of Emacs users who maintain a shared Emacs configuration called &quot;emacs-config.&quot; This configuration includes a variety of packages and tools that are optimized for Google&#x27;s specific needs, including integration with the company&#x27;s internal systems and tools. 2.

                              <span>Just switched to elpaca and was pleasantly surprised how fast it was to spin up a new installation (minutes down to seconds). But I&#x27;m surprised to see how much faster startup time is. I had spent a lot of time tuning my config with use-package, and was pretty pleased with a seven second startup. I use emacsclient, so this only really mattered when tuning the config and restarting - but still acceptable.
 But with elpaca, my startup time is just over a second! (measured via time emacs --eval &quot;(save-buffers-kill-terminal)&quot; It&#x27;s possible that some of this is due to no longer loading things that have been added into Emacs over the time that my configuration has grown (when was org-mode made native??) - and a side benefit of elpaca is that it complained about this and made me fix it.
 But does multi-threading improve both installation time AND start-up time?

 I am currently using nov.el to read some e-books in Emacs and I am having trouble justifying the text. I have tried using the justify-kp package but the code provided on https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/ doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.
 I was wondering if anyone could help me out with this issue or provide me with some working code for justifying text in nov.el using justify-kp. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance.

 In my emacs config the completion is shown in a temporary buffer and the only way to select a candidate is to click on it. How do I get the doom behavior?

                              <span>Hi!
 I teach Haskell at the university. Every year I have a problem setting up everything on school computers. Especially for testing during midterms and finals.
 So I made a small repo with scaffolding for GitHub Classroom. It includes devcontainer. So it can be used in browser with complete Haskell environment (in codespace). No need for any local installation. Of course it can be used locally with VS Code. Also autograding GitHub action is set up. It uses HSpec for testing.
 If this is useful to anyone you can find repo here:
 https://github.com/Idokorro/haskell-exam-autograding
 It&#x27;s nothing much. It&#x27;s an empty project. But it took me a while to set everything up. Maybe it can save someone some time.

                              <span>Hi newbie question. I am coming from OOP background and have some difficulty understanding how Haskell treats what in other languages I would call &quot;functions overload (by return value)&quot; 
 The following code does not compile 
 foo 5 &#x3D; &quot;5&quot;
 foo 5 &#x3D; 5 
 Compiler tells that it &quot;cannot deduce ...&quot;. OK, get it. The compiler infers the function type from first foo definition and cannot match second definition with this type. However consider this. I can define infinite instances of say type Applicative Functor a for different types a, with multiple function definitions of &quot;pure&quot; that takes operator and returns something of type Application Functor a. Eventually it is the same multiple functions definitions which only differ by return value. 
 Why then it is allowed?

                              <span>Hey there, I am a student just recently starting out with functional programming through Haskell. I have worked already with it on my university&#x27;s computers but want to install it on my own to practice more. I hope this question isn&#x27;t too obvious and makes sense, but I saw the command needed to install said it must be done by a non-root/non-admin user. I use the main user on my own computer so I have admin permissions and would prefer to just install it there for practicality. So my questions mainly are, am I understanding the requirement right? Will I have to switch users to install it? What would happen if I just do it on my regular main user session? Would appreciate it if anyone can help. Thank you!
 For reference, I work on a Macbook with Ventura

                              <span>I&#x27;m a Typescript programmer by day, but I am learning Haskell by night, I have just finished reading Learn you a Haskell and I&#x27;ve built a simple blog using Scotty and Blaze, and I also worked a little with Aeson. That&#x27;s all my experience with Haskell. And having experience working with Typescript, which has a lot of really cool typing features, I&#x27;m wondering if one can replicate them in Haskell. Specifically, my question is about type mappings and conditional types. In Typescript, one can define an interface (basically, a record type):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ts interface Person { name: string; age: number; married: boolean; }
 interface Profile extends Person { friends: Array; job: { title: string; salary: number; onVacation: boolean; }; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And then it&#x27;s possible to create a new type out of this one by recursively replacing all numbers and boolean with strings:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ts // This type gets a type argument T and recursively replaces all its boolean and number fields with strings type AllStrings &#x3D; { [Key in keyof T]: T[Key] extends number ? string : T[Key] extends boolean ? string : AllStrings; };
 function parseBadJSON(badJSON: AllStrings): Profile { // mapping logic } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Moreover, you can see record type inheritance with extends keyword.
 I had a task at my job where I needed to parse a JSON that stores all values as strings, and I needed to map it to a JSON with numbers and booleans, where they were supposed to be, so that&#x27;s how I achieved the correct typings for my mapping function (parseBadJSON). How would you do that in Haskell?

                              <span>Greetings!
 Have been working on a side project to test out various FP libraries and how they could interop with each other: https://bitbucket.org/mucaho/ceffbanx
 Hope this provides some inspiration in case you ever need to interface between various FP-related libraries yourself, or at least highlights some lesser-known tools you could leverage in your future project.
 Keep in mind, this was created for educational purposes solely, and there are certainly better ways to go about such interop.
 Libraries used:
 * cats * cats-effect * cats-mtl * eff * scala effekt * izumi bio * fs2 * tofu
 Let me know what you think, any feedback would be much appreciated

                              <span>I am learning cats effect 3 through this doc: Async | cats effect docs and this API doc: Async | cats effect api docs, but I can&#x27;t find enough examples to explain the usage and the worth of async and async_ functions.
 The only example is function fromFuture, it turns IO[Future[A]] to IO[A] but throws Throwable if Future failed, giving no way to handle error. So why not just using IO or Defered instead of fromFuture?
 Can you give me some examples or explanations about this? Any viewpoint will be appreciated.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I write a demo code to describe how async be used, but it doesn&#x27;t work.
  @Test def testAsync: Unit &#x3D; val completableFuture &#x3D; CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() &#x3D;&gt; { Thread.sleep(2000) 5 }) val secondIO: IO[Int] &#x3D; Async[IO].async(cb &#x3D;&gt; Sync[IO].delay { // action: call this callback // Invoke the callback with the result of the completable future val stage &#x3D; completableFuture.handle { case (a, null) &#x3D;&gt; cb(Right(a)) case (_, e) &#x3D;&gt; cb(Left(e)) } // val: a finalizer // Cancel the completable future if the fiber is canceled Some(Sync[IO].delay { println(&quot;cancel on Async&quot;) stage.cancel(false) }.void) } ) val attempt: IO[Either[Throwable, Int]] &#x3D; secondIO.onCancel(IO.println(&quot;cancel on MonadCancel 1&quot;)).attempt val trace: IO[Unit] &#x3D; attempt.onCancel(IO.println(&quot;cancel on MonadCancel 2&quot;)).flatMap(value &#x3D;&gt; IO.println(value)) val task &#x3D; for { fiber &lt;- trace.start _ &lt;- fiber.cancel outcome &lt;- fiber.join _ &lt;- IO.println(outcome) } yield () task.unsafeRunSync() // throw an AssertError Assert.assertTrue(completableFuture.isCancelled) () 
 The finalizer doesn&#x27;t work, why?

                              <span>I have made several notes on papers in my Org-roam directory which I can access with C-c n f and they contain the :ROAM_REFS: tags in the :PROPERTIES: heading. When I run citar-open-notes, it displays all the references in my .bib files but is not showing me all the notes for those references in my org-roam directory even though they exist. Strangely enough, it only detects two notes in the org-roam directory that correspond to two references in my bib files.
 How can I get citar to detect my org-roam notes for all the references in my bib files? Currently, if I execute citar-open-notes it asks to create a new note for that reference, even though the note already exists.
 EDIT: So it seems I need to enable citar-org-roam-mode everytime I open emacs. How do I make this the default behaviour…</span>

                              <span>I just added the following line to my init.el:
  (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-o&quot;) &#x27;man) 
 but it is not enough. Before, if I wanted to perform the shell command equivalent to man 2 read I would do M-x man RET 2 read. Emacs doesn&#x27;t like the numbers and spaces, and takes multiple seconds to load it up, whereas M-x man RET read is instantaneous, but not what I want. 
 What is the easy way to grab a specific numbered man page?
 Something where I can see all the reads would be ideal, so that I could do something like M-n within man-mode to browse through my options, or even something that can see whether I&#x27;m in a shell buffer, or in C mode and grab the relevant man page.

                              <span>Last weekend I rewrote some hacky elisp that’s been in my config for over a decade into a much less hacky package:
 https://github.com/jimeh/yank-indent
 It’s the first package I’ve written in years, so I’m more than happy to hear any feedback and/or criticism, as I’m fairly out of the loop :)
 My goal was for the package to be something you install and enable once and never have to think about again, as it enables itself in relevant buffers only, and ignores buffers (YAML, Python, Makefile) where it would cause issues.
 If anyone is curious of the hacky solution I used to have in my config, here is the comment where I initially replaced it with an earlier version of yank-indent.

                              <span>How do I dynamically hide or show certain infixes in transient, based on the current argument values of other transients?
 In the example below if the user selects an ice cream I want to show the ice cream options and hide the pie options. If the user selects a pie I want to clear the ice cream selection, show the pie options and hide the ice cream options.
 (transient-define-prefix restaurant-menu () [&quot;Main Course&quot; (&quot;m&quot; &quot;main course&quot; &quot;main-course&#x3D;&quot; :choices (&quot;hamburger&quot; &quot;cheeseburger&quot; &quot;chicken sandwich&quot;))] [&quot;Dessert&quot; (&quot;i&quot; &quot;ice cream&quot; &quot;ice-cream&#x3D;&quot; :choices (&quot;chocolate&quot; &quot;vanilla&quot; &quot;strawberry&quot;)) (&quot;p&quot; &quot;pie&quot; &quot;pie&#x3D;&quot; :choices (&quot;apple&quot; &quot;cherry&quot; &quot;pumpkin&quot;))] [&quot;Ice Cream Options&quot; (&quot;c&quot; &quot;chocolate sauce&quot; &quot;chocolate-sauce&quot;) (&quot;s&quot; &quot;sprinkles&quot; &quot;sprinkles&quot;) (&quot;w&quot; &quot;whipped cream&quot; &quot;whipped-cream&quot;)] [&quot;Pie Options&quot; (&quot;r&quot; &quot;crumb topping&quot; &quot;crumb-topping&quot;) (&quot;w&quot; &quot;whipped cream&quot; &quot;whipped-cream&quot;)] [&quot;Order&quot; (&quot;o&quot; &quot;order to dine in&quot; order-food-dine-in) (&quot;g&quot; &quot;order to go&quot; order-food-to-go)]) 
 I tried :if predicates, but it seems they only evaluate upon initial prefix setup, not when values change.
 I also experimented with the Setting up another transient manually in the Transient Showcase, using transient-setup to dynamically replace the current prefix with a new similar one, but with ice cream or pie options. It looks like the same transient with the dessert options dynamically changing. The problem there is that it nests the child transient, so you have to type C-g twice to exit. It&#x27;s also a little inelegant as I copy and paste most of the transient definition into the two variations. It seemed like the wrong tool for this job.
 Is there a way to dynamically hide and show infixes in transient based on the current argument values of other infixes? Or is there a more appropriate UX pattern to use for this scenario with transient?
 Thanks!

                              <span>A literate org mode document that tangles, using noweb an org file into a theme file is a nice way of organizing themes by the files and sections they customize instead of by the sections needed by the file. See: https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org
 Details:
 I spent the weekend setting up my own color theme. What I did not like about how this is done is that the color theme file is broken into sections by the need of the functions to define it. What I wanted to do was to setup the theme organized by the mode or functionality. Since others sharing has helped me in the past, I thought I would share this with the community. (See: The Proximity Principle at https://kula.blog/posts/proximity_principle/)
 I had been using the following techniques anyway, so I was most of the way there:
  
Used GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (Brandon Invergo&#x27; Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html
 Used literate config file using org-babel. This lets you write an org file with emacs lisp source code blocks that are saved to an .el file when it is tangled.) See Literate Programming here: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming
  
But, this still made me sequence the code in the sections that the theme file required. I did not want that. So noweb came to the rescue. Using noweb, you can have a source block that will include references to source blocks defined in other areas of the org file. This allowed me to organize the file the way I wanted to. The top of the file is the skeleton for the theme file with the sections defined, and the sections below each add to the theme section as they need.
 In case you missed it above, see https://gitlab.com/stefan.koch.micro/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/stefan-theme-tangle.org for the full details.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.2 on GNU Linux Arch with centaur-tabs.
 I would like to simply be able to save opened tabs (buffers) into lists, so I could reopen them easily as one does in Chromium or Firefox with Tab Manager Plus.
 There seem to be many packages that manage sessions (bookmarks, bookmarks+, desktop, desktop+, burly, persp-mode, etc.).
 ​
 What would be the simplest implementation of the following functionalities:
 ​
 - Saving opened buffers into a list with a given name
 - Opening buffers from a list by selecting the name of this list
 - Deleting a list of buffers by selecting its name (not deleting the files, just the list)

                              <span>Been struggling with this for a while so I caved and just run my code from shell rather than the Python buffer.
 What my current process is:
  
Open Shell buffer
 Navigate to the folder my .py file is in
 python3 -m venv myenv
 source myenv/bin/activate
 Return to Python buffer
 m-x pyvenv-activate
  
Step 6 above will only work the first time I set it all up, after that it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything! Only way to get it working again is to delete the virtual environment and set it up again, I don&#x27;t want to do this every time I re-open my program. So as I said, I&#x27;ve been just been going to shell buffer and doing source myenv/bin/activate every time and then just running my code from there rather than the Python buffer.
 Any advice how I am supposed to do this?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m having an issue with my Haskell code and I was hoping someone could help me out. I have two methods, a and b, both of which use the space function that accepts zero or more spaces. The a method works correctly by skipping over any spaces and then parsing the input &quot; a&quot;. However, when I execute the b method with the input &quot; a&quot;, it gets stuck in an endless loop.
 I suspect the issue has to do with the use of the &quot;many&quot; function in &quot;space&quot;, which is causing the endless loop when b is executed. However, I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is happening.
 If anyone could shed some light on this issue and explain why the b method is causing an endless loop, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>My main programming language in undergrad was Haskell (long story, I was single-handedly taught the majority of my computer science courses from an elderly Canadian professor in the UK who loves Haskell/functional programming and is squarely in academia). However, whenever I‘ve told people that I know Haskell they’d either: a) laugh and ask why that was my main programming knowledge or b) joke I should work in a “Haskell basement shop” (?). I’ve never personally applied my Haskell knowledge after I graduated college or thought to.
 So this may seem like a dumb question, but I’m genuinely curious, what do all of you here use Haskell for in real life, not including for school/academics?

 Hello Haskell community, I&#x27;m making a desktop program in Haskell (mainly for fun and type safety) as a frontend for another GPL licensed program. However I&#x27;m not very good when it comes to licensing.
 GHC and almost all Haskell libraries use BSD style licenses. I do not know if I can use these BSD libraries on my program that is distributed under GPL. I would like to distribute my program under GPL due to it&#x27;s copyleft nature. Is it legally possible?
 Can someone please help me clarify?

I&#x27;ve searched through Hackage/Hoogle and could not find any easy way to convert between them. The only way I can come up with is to base calculations on current time which is both inefficient and convoluted.
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 EDIT: some context.
 I am trying to cache JWT token validation results using https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cache. Cache expiry has to be specified using TimeSpec. JWT tokens are parsed and validated using JOSE which in turn provides token expiry using UTCTime.
 EDIT2: rant. I am new to Haskell but it is sometimes a frustrating experience (although I am positively surprised in general: Nix + Haskell Flake + HLS + VSCode is a pretty nice interactive dev environement) - compositionality is one of the main advertised advantage of the language. In practice it is very often difficult to combine different libraries as they are based on some incompatible concrete types (in this case cache could have abstracted away the actual time representation as it is not really important to its operation)

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;m teaching myself Haskell and only beginning to understand the necessary precision of type declaration. I&#x27;m trying to get my final list of outputs to be Doubles. My simple function here calculates multiplying an investment and removing some % profit, outputting a list of net profit as repeated each of n times:
 mtp x y z &#x3D; [ ( investment * ((flip*percent)^n)) | n  Double -&gt; Double -&gt; [Double] 
 but still giving me those long decimals
 Help would be much appreciated, thanks :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a transient with transient-define-prefix and I&#x27;m stumbling in a couple of difficulties.
 The first one is the one mentioned in the title. I&#x27;d like to make sure some cleanup code is executed when leaving the transient, however that may happen, with transient-do-quit or with C-g, whatever. But I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to do that. I even tried to create a suffix overriding C-g but couldn&#x27;t get that to work. I also tried (desperate measures...) to advise the transient and wrapped it in unwind-protect itself, without success. So, is there a way to ensure some code is executed after the transient? 
 The second is that I&#x27;d like to let bind a variable while the transient is active. Is there a way to do that?

Merge branch &#x27;B&#x27; into A
  
When I perform a squash merge, I&#x27;m not really a fan of the default message (sorry, I don&#x27;t have it on hand). I keep the commit log that it includes, but I usually give it a commit message something like:
  
Squash merged branch &#x27;B&#x27; into A
  
I was wondering if any of yall knew how to change the defaults. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a Magit-related configuration, or if it&#x27;s a Git configuration.
 Any and all help would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hi,
 I use EWW as a browser in emacs but sometimes I need a browser that is more GUI oriented. I stumbled on two such browsers that can be used in a terminal: Carbonyl and Browsh
 My knowledge of elisp is still very limited and I was wondering if anybody had succes using such a browser inside emacs. Is this possible and how can this be achieved?
 Thanks!

 I found cape has an easy way to connect it with the company backend. Just use the cape-company-to-capf. And I found there is a company backend slime-company already there. I think maybe I can connect it with cape. 
 First, I tried:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package slime :config (straight-use-package &#x27;slime-company) (setq slime-contribs &#x27;(slime-fancy slime-repl slime-scratch slime-trace-dialog slime-cl-indent slime-company))

 it works &quot;well&quot; except every time cape appear with the company mini buffer at the same time when I am trying to do complete.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I use emacs with eglot+clangd to do C++ with projectile and ivy/counsel/swiper combo.
 I had a problem: every file I open has a delay of up to 5 seconds before I even saw it. This is definitely an issue with eglot+clangd because when I disable it completely everything works just fine. Then I set eglot-sync-connect to 0 and it helped with opening the first file of a project.
 How can I speed up opening other files in a project? This is my profiler report for opening a file with projectile + swiper. The delay before I can interact with emacs was about 3-4 seconds.
 ​
 P.S. lsp-mode + clangd has the same issue.

 With nerd-icons.el, you only need to install one nerd font (e.g. from https://www.nerdfonts.com) instead of installing a bunch of fonts that just do one thing (display icons).
 Nerd-icons.el also provides unified experience in TTY and GUI.
 Nerd-icons currently supports dired, minibuffer-completion, treemacs, doom-modeline, and more on the road...
 As a heavy user on both mode, this is a killer feature to me.

                              <span>Without polluting the Emacs mail lists, I thought that this discussion is better suited for the Emacs subreddit.
 Do you know what are the workflows of the key contributors of Emacs? I am talking about key role people like Eli Zaretskii and Po Lu.
 I know that Richard Stallman has expressed it here:
 https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html
 But, I did not find much about other key contributors.
 I am specifically interested in their approach at using Emacs and I am asking because that might teach me something new or perhaps help me re-evaluate how I use Emacs.
 Do they use the default Emacs keybindings?
 What packages do they rely on?
 For which tasks do they use Emacs?
 What other software do they use and why is Emacs not suitable for covering those needs?

                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>I love org-sparse-tree. However, I want a variant of it that will hide all headlines that don’t contain a match for a regex word. This is different from the usual behavior where, if a tree doesn’t contain a match, the entire tree is collapsed and the level 1 heading is still visible.
 This would be useful because some of my documents have a LOT of headlines, and I currently have to scroll a lot to see the matches of org-sparse-tree. Is there a package that does this? If not, any rough idea of how to hack org to do this?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I bought this book, and love it. Super clear and a great learning resource for ZIO. Of course, as everyone knows (and is clearly stated on the website) it’s a work in progress. They did say updates are weekly but I haven’t seen any in over a month. How are they distributed? If I bought the book will I get an email? I’m sure the authors are busy guys but I hope they can go rent a cabin for a week or two and knock out the rest.

                              <span>I assume you’ve heard of property-based testing. Has it ever seemed annoying, impractical, or unclear? 
 Give it another chance. I promise to keep it practical and not talk demonstrate overused examples like reverse(reverse(list)) shouldBe list.

 Ideally, I&#x27;d like something like the Emacs UI; hierarchical bullets, which are collapsed by default and that you can toggle on and off. &quot;Expand all&quot; and &quot;collapse all&quot; would be nice to have too.
 Another nice bonus is if I could this just by importing some JS in the generated HTML header, without requiring any extra package.

  $ emacs -f org-agenda 
 opens emacs to the org-agenda dispatcher where I have to either type a, n, or one of the other options. I then need to type n to get the view I want, but how can I pass it directly so it opens my agenda view without the extra keystroke?
 The command
  $ emacs -f org-agenda-week-view 
 doesn&#x27;t work (definition is void), I guess because org-agenda isn&#x27;t started yet.

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I recently bought a course in udemy for org mode, I think it’s the only one there in that platform. Considering I’ll be using beorg I think I have a long way to go and learn. 
 I won’t ask for resources as there are plenty. However, I’ll ask for some successful cases of people that aren’t in the CS field or are developers. This because I just want to organize my life in plain text and use some of the other perks org provides. 
 So, how long did it took you? How do you use org mode? 
 Thanks!

bearriver: API-compatible implementation of Yampa. (The Bear River is a tributary to the Yampa river.)
 
dunai-test: QuickCheck-based temporal testing library that can be connected with the testing system haskell-titan.
 
 See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai#features for details on Dunai&#x27;s features.
 This release has addressed mainly styling issues. All library code now conforms to the main rules of the style guide we follow (which is publicly documente…</span>

                              <span>Last year, I created a web framework based on monadic parsing called Okapi. I got a lot of good feedback and criticism, so I want to thank those that provided their thoughts and ideas.

 EDIT: I forgot to mention that the docs site is broken on mobile for now. Please view on Desktop if possible.
 TL;DR - Okapi, a web framework that I started working on last year, now uses an Applicative instead of a Monad. This has made the framework a lot more consistent and easier to understand. It also makes it possible to automatically generate OpenAPI specifications from your endpoint definitions. It should be possible to generate clients as well, but I haven&#x27;t worked on this yet.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m currently taking a Functional Programming course, and we are using Haskell. I had a really hard time setting everything up, but I think I finally have something that is somewhat working. I&#x27;m using a M1 Mac so I decided to install ghcup using brew. I then installed everything else haskell related using ghcup (stack, cabal, ghc, and hls). When I then started working on my assignment the code had some imports like Random and HUnit. So in order to get that to work I tried to install those using Cabal. At this point I noticed that I also needed llvm so I installed llvm@13 using brew and added the path to $PATH. I then did cabal install --lib random and it worked! However, I have found out that this is probably no the preferred way of using cabal and I wanted to switch to a stack project which leads me to my question.
 Is there a good way to remove this libraries that I installed? I have found that the files are installed in the .cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7. In this folder I have HUnt-1.6.2.0-18526221 and rndm-1.2.1.1-c70f7c08. Can I just remove those files? Or is there a better way to do it? I basically do not want random and HUnit to be installed for every Haskell projekt I&#x27;m working on moving forward. Some noteworthy things might be that when I do cabal list --installed they don&#x27;t show, but I can compile the code without any issues.
 I hope I was able to explain my issue and appreciate any help I can get. If there are any issues with the way I installed llvm or haskell stuff that would also be extremely appreciated. It feels like I have spent way to much time on just setting stuff up and would need to start doing some actual programing...

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty much a Haskell fanboy, but I&#x27;d like to ask this of production users: why Haskell instead of Rust, why Haskell instead of Python?
 ​
 These two languages come up because they&#x27;re enormously popular languages with large ecosystems that recapitulate many of the benefits of Haskell, and for which hiring is relatively easy.
 ​
 Rust, for instance, captures much of Haskell&#x27;s correctness, missing only HKTs, although the development of Generic Associated Types promises to duplicate much of the capability of Haskell higher-kinded types.
 ​
 What&#x27;s more, Rust has stable memory use and performance characteristics, and while the black art of pushing Haskell to C speeds hasn&#x27;t wholly died, Rust in general outperforms Haskell both in time and space complexity.

                              <span>I&#x27;m beginning the process of writing a JIT compiler for a custom DSL that will be embedded in a commercial product. Though I come from the Rust world, I figured this would be a great opportunity to learn and use haskell for my compiler.
 2 days later and I&#x27;m still failing to get a project to build with the LLVM bindings. The repository seems fairly inactive, is many versions behind modern LLVM, and recent github issues documenting build issues have been met with silence. This seems like a very basic package for a language that is supposed to be well suited to writing compilers. I did not expect to have this issue at all. Even flipping Python seemingly has more up to date LLVM bindings.
 So I&#x27;m sadly considering abandoning using haskell for my project. Are there other bindings I&#x27;m not aware of? Is there some other way people do code generation?
 I would love a solution because I was looking forward to learning haskell.
 Thanks for the advice.

                              <span>no-littering used to set backup-directory-alist so that all backup files are created in ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/.
 (Even if you don&#x27;t use no-littering, check the value of that variable. I suspect that many users have themselves customized that variable to put all backup files in a single directory, in which case they would also be affected.)
 If you use emacs/emacsclient as EDITOR and an external tool opens an unencrypted file containing some sensitive data in a directory on a tmpfs file-system, then the backup file would by default be created in the same directory, so it would not hit a disk and be discarded after a reboot.
 Note that this only affects you, if the visited file is not encrypted. So if you, for example, visit ~/.authsource.gpg, then the backup file is also encrypted, regardless of where it resides.
 Please update to release 1.3.0 or snapshot 20230420 and delete all files ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!tmp!... and ~/.config/emacs/var/backup/!dev!shm!....
 This gets you back to how Emacs behaves by default.
  
The default isn&#x27;t so great either. No backups are created for files in /tmp, but for files in /dev/shm backups are created. To prevent that you would have to use a custom backup-enable-predicate function. (If you don&#x27;t do that, then the backup files sticks around until a reboot, but at least then they get discarded.)
  
This issue was discovered a day ago (https://lonely.town/@wasamasa/110227701055899570) and was reported an hour ago (https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/issues/200).
 In the future, please report security issues privately.

                              <span>I would like to build a package to show stocks history comparisons in charts. I have read that it is not possible to produce plots from pure Elisp.
 I never build a package, so I was wondering what would be the best way to generate (modern looking with fast (light) and smooth integration) charts in an Emacs buffer. 
 Note: I usually use Plotly Python for my dataviz, but I know JS offers more possibilities, so I&#x27;m considering learning how to use some JS dataviz libraries (like d3.js) .

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m using Emacs version 29.0.90 (Development version 2b10e1827d3b) and I keep encountering the issue in subject when I install a package. That is, Emacs seems stuck (I waited for multiple hours) while scraping files for loaddefs. If I stop the process (C-g) and restart Emacs, I get the error:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/marcop/.config/emacs/elpa/
/-autoloads)
 Do you have any suggestion on how to debug?
 Cheers
 --- EDIT 1 – 2023-04-20 12:26
 Actually, not all packages create this issue. So far, I identified csv-mode, ess, org-contrib, and polymode as problematic packages.

Emacs 29.1 will not be released tomorrow or the day after. We still have at least several weeks till then, with at least one more pretest.

                              <span>I’m just getting started with org-mode in Emacs and am looking at options for keeping my org files in sync between computers — specifically, between two Macs. A complication is that on one of the Macs I am limited in what software I can install, for work-related reasons (for example, syncthing might not be an option, Dropbox is probably OK, as is iCloud Drive).
 It’s most important to me that the syncing should be robust, reliable, and secure. I’d like to have files sync automatically in the background, rather than having to trigger a sync manually before leaving one machine or starting on the other. Similarly, it would be good if I don’t have to remember to close all buffers before I leave a machine (i.e. if conflicts and simultaneous editing aren’t a problem, or at least that resolving conflicts doesn’t risk losing data). Also in terms of avoiding data loss, I’d like to be able to make backups of the files, ideally with versioning in case I need to go back and fix something.
 End-to-end encryption would be desirable if it’s cloud storage (which might make iCloud Drive preferable to Dropbox). Being able to sync to an iOS app like Beorg would be nice too, but is less important.
 However, one concern I have about iCloud (apart from some suggestions that it&#x27;s not always reliable) is that it seems like you can’t always guarantee that all files are really stored locally on the Mac, rather than only in the cloud, even if you don’t select “optimize storage&quot; (see for example https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/ ). So, it seems that backup solutions aren’t guaranteed to be able to see and backup the files stored in there (if they happen to be online only). Otherwise, I’d be happy to do my own backups of the directory with something like rsync to my NAS.
 Are there any solutions that fit my wishlist, or am I being too demanding in what I’m looking for? Any pointers would be very welcome!

                              <span>I&#x27;ll go first again. But please take all this as an invitation to share your adventures. As you see, mine are boring and you are probably doing more interesting stuff.
Typical of when I&#x27;m in class, my note take is slowed. More accurately, my refactoring of notes into atomic-sized notes has slowed. I will add as many words to my ZK, but each note is bigger. Because of the speed of the class, I don&#x27;t feel I have time to refactor the notes I&#x27;ve captured from reading, say, &quot;Read Hot Epic.&quot; I keep all the ideas captured from the story in a single note, hoping to atomize the note sometime. In the meantime, I have all the ideas, and because of my search skills, the ideas are not lost.
@Sascha&#x27;s article Why the Single Note Matters is a real eye opener. Care and attention must be paid to each and every note. The effort in this practice is what is called zettelkasting. The rewards are a supportive ZK partner. If you consider this a downside, the downside is that this activity siows time. You will naturally slow down. In a non-pressure environment, this is a good thing. Not so sure it works in a classroom setting with a schedule to keep up with.
I&#x27;ve started a list in my journal of projects to advance once I&#x27;ve completed the food writing seminar. That way, they can be off my mind and safely on a list. (Classic GTD principle)

                              <span>I recently watched the documentary Aby Warburg: Metamorphosis and Memory (Wechsler, 2016) via Kanopy (for free using my local library’s gateway) and thought that others here interested in the ideas of memory in culture, history, and art history may appreciate it. While a broad biography of a seminal figure in the development of art history in the early 20th century, there are some interesting bits relating to art and memory as well as a mention of Frances A. Yates whose research on memory was influenced by Warburg’s library.
Of specific &quot;note” is the fact that Aby Warburg (1866-1929) had a significant zettelkasten-based note taking practice and portions of his collection (both written as well as images) are featured within the hour long documentary. You&#x27;ll see it in the opening scenes in t…</span>

GHC 9.4.5 is now available by Zubin Duggal
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.4.5. This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing a few issues found in 9.4.4.
concurrency and Performance by Nicolas Trangez
Testing concurrent code using DejaFu requires the use of MonadConc and MonadSTM instead of plain IO and STM. Is there any performance impact, and if there is, can it be recovered?

As scary or awe-inspiring as it is, one can’t deny the great impact AI can have when applied to fields with positive social value, such as healthcare.
The MedTech industry is buzzing thanks to a continuous stream of innovation, promising to be more precise, efficient and accessible than ever.
In particular oncology, a branch of medicine that focuses on cancer, could benefit immensely from these new technologies, which may enable clinicians to detect cancer earlier and increase chances of survival.

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I am trying to get skewer-mode to work, in particular, I want to see changes I make to html files in emacs to be automatically updated in the corresponding browser window. I have tried to follow the descriptions on the package&#x27;s GitHub page and also this Emacs Stack-Exchange post, but neither of these affords me the &quot;live change&quot; I seek, and most other guides don&#x27;t regard HTML, but only CSS or Javascript (which I&#x27;ll also need, but that&#x27;s for later).
 Do you know of any good guide that you can recommend, or do you have personal experience with this package and care to share some insights?
 Also, while I&#x27;m at it, I am also open for tips when it comes to webdev. I currently use &#x60;eglot&#x60; and &#x60;tagedit&#x60;, which makes editing quite a bit less of a hassle, but I still miss the coziness of editing lisp with &#x60;sly&#x60; and &#x60;paredit&#x60;.
 Have a good day, folks :)

 Long time user of emacs (since 1994 or 5 using emacs in terminal on a sun sparc workstation) but not a long time init.el file customizer. But now I&#x27;m trying to fix some things that really bug the crap out of me and this is one. I use which-key (because my memory sucks), but as you see from the gif, it shifts the buffers in the main windows. Is there a way to prevent this so that when the side window goes away, the buffers (and cursor position) remain at their original position?

                              <span>On two different laptops on different networks, with or without .emacs, it just freezes for a couple of minutes. I feel like it has only been in the past year or so that I have experienced this. 
 I&#x27;ve used the profiler, but there&#x27;s nothing to see, it&#x27;s just opening/saving the file.
 I&#x27;ve looked at task manager and I&#x27;m spotting any culprits (the two machines have different AV setups).
 I&#x27;m using the 64 bit 28.2 version on both machines. 
 I&#x27;ve chased all over the internet looking for things to try and nothing seems to make a difference. I&#x27;ve been using emacs in one version or another since the 80s and this is the first time I&#x27;m considering giving up on it. 
 Using docker or cygwin is a possibility on one of the machines, but not the one I use for client work.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I am still trying to get two-way sync&#x27;ed calendars working in Emacs (it seems to me this is the most under-developed aspect in the Emacs eco-system).
 I found vdirsyncer which seems like a nice and promising idea similar to maildir which I already use with notmuch, even though it seems too opinionated and the support for Google calender seems largely untested/unsupported.
 More annoyingly, Microsoft Exchange calendars do not support CalDAV which means one must use tools like davmail. I&#x27;ve had little success getting DavMail to work with two-factor authentication and vdirsyncer also warns that davmail can lead to data loss or strange issues (davmail seems too big, being in Java, for me to hack around). 
 Has anyone had success using Exchange calenders in Emacs? What is your workflow?
 Is anyone using vdirsyncer with Google and/or Exchange? Any hints you can share?
 Thanks!
 PS: I&#x27;ve asked a similar question before and I know of org-caldav, which still requires a CalDAV proxy and org-gcal, which only works for Google.

                              <span>Just want to praise a package called jinx, it provides a spell checker for Emacs, which is really fast.
 Back when I discovered flyspell, it was (for me) a big leap forward in usability and speed. I&#x27;ve used it since, until now. Even so flyspell is nice, it still made editing feel a bit sluggish. Therefore I enabled it only, when editing prose and never while coding.
 But jinx is so fast and non-disturbing, I keep it globally enabled all the time.
 You might like it, too. :)
 (I&#x27;m using it on Linux, and do not know how well it works on other OSes, since it utilizes libenchant.)

 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-verbatim nil :foreground &quot;firebrick1&quot; :font &quot;Fira Code Retina-13&quot; :weight &#x27;bold :inherit &#x27;(shadow fixed-pitch)) 
 but it does not work. I am pretty sure that Fira Code Retina has bold fonts. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Does anyone know how to enable imenu in ibuffer-mode? 
 Or maybe there&#x27;s iBuffer command to quickly jump to one of the rows in IBuffer, similar to how imenu works. Then I&#x27;d just remap imenu to that command.
 Update: Found it. (ibuffer-jump-to-buffer). If you want to see only visible buffers in the list: (setq ibuffer-jump-offer-only-visible-buffers t).
 Doom:
  (map! :after ibuffer :map ibuffer-mode-map [remap imenu] #&#x27;ibuffer-jump-to-buffer)

 Remote work is possible, but Houston candidates are preferrable. Or if remote then as close to the CST time zone as possible.
 If you do not have linked in account you can email resume to vverdi at masterword dot com.

                              <span>Fourmolu is a formatter for Haskell source code. It is a fork of Ormolu, with upstream improvements continually merged.
 0.12 comes with some pretty notable changes: * GHC 9.6 support * A new single-constraint-parens option for disabling the feature of adding parentheses to contexts with one constraint * A new column-limit option for breaking lines at a given length (as much as possible) * A new --print-defaults CLI flag for generating a default fourmolu.yaml config file
 With this release, we&#x27;re also excited to announce a new website: https://fourmolu.github.io! The website contains a web app where you can paste in Haskell code, change configuration values, and see the result. It also contains docs for each of the configuration options with examples. As this is the first release of the web app, there are bound to be bugs and things that could be improved, so please write an issue for anything you find in the web app!

                              <span>Let&#x27;s define a function:
 dummyFold :: (Foldable f) &#x3D;&gt; f a -&gt; Int dummyFold &#x3D;  const 0 
 where  is a place holder. For example if f is the good old [] (list) type then  could be replaced by, foldl&#x27;.
 Now the question is, if I want to write the function dummyFold in such a way that it works for all (hopefully) Foldable type instances, how should I go about it? Is there a generic way to do it? I know there exists the package ListLike, however, I wanted to know the haskeline way.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I was reading about &quot;storyboarding&quot; as a useful way to arrange research and prepare to write. The book (Turabian) said the utility of a storyboard versus an outline, is that you can easily move information around. This made me think of org mode, which I already use productively for outlining. 
 So I know it already can do the basic task of storyboarding as is. However, I was curious about whether org mode could display information more like a &quot;storyboard.&quot; Either horizontally or (maybe better for not having to scroll so much) tiling.
 I imagine this would work with the top level heading defining a card / unit and then units would be displayed horizontally or in a grid, rather than a vertical list.
 Is this something that already exists?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am writing elisp code to programatically assign a property to a heading.
 I use the API to parse the buffer and I select headings for further processing:
 (let ((buffer-ast (org-element-parse-buffer))) (org-element-map buffer-ast &#x27;headline (lambda (hl) (when (&#x3D; (org-element-property :level hl) 1) ...))) 
 Here hl is a headline, and I want to get and set its properties (the stuff in the :properties drawer). I am reading the documentation for the API (API documentation link) and the Syntax (Org syntax link), but I don&#x27;t get how to get or set a property.
 Thanks for your help
 Mirko

 Is there a way to access my org files given these restrictions? I can access iCloud where my org files are placed.

                              <span>This Release Candidate version of Indigo (a Scala 3 pixel art 2D game engine for Scala.js) is the result of six months work and will hopefully become a full release after undergoing a bit more testing. Feel free to take it for a spin! 🚀
 It contains a good number of general improvements that are based on real usage during the production of our biggest demo to date, hopefully coming soon-ish!
 The main bulk of the work is a total replacement of all GLSL based shaders in favour of programs written using Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 shader program writing library that is currently aimed at WebGL + GLSL. The purpose of this work is to begin to separate Indigo from Scala.js and WebGL, so that the project can look at supporting other rendering technologies (WebGPU is the next likely target), and one day, other platforms like the JVM and/or Native. Custom GLSL shaders will still be supported for the for the foreseeable future, but existing shaders will require very minor modification to be compatible.
 Indigo&#x27;s website is slowly going through a necessary rebuild, so for now it&#x27;s advisable to check out the release notes below if you decide to try this version out. Alternatively, do come and say hello on our Discord server if you need any help, or even just to show off what you&#x27;re making. 😁

 I try to change window url as a side effect with basic Tyrian&#x27;s counter app. But then I obtain errors inside browser. 
 case Msg.Decrement &#x3D;&gt;
 (
 model - 10,
 Cmd.SideEffect(
 Window().history.replaceState({}, &quot;About&quot;, &quot;/about&quot;)

 Errors:

 Would be glad for any help :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a Scala client-server application using ZIO. My server exposes a RESTful API and must be able to handle WebSocket connections. I want to implement something similar to the way kubectl and the Kubernetes API server work, where a RESTful request with a payload is sent to the server, including a protocol upgrade header in the initial request to establish a WebSocket connection.
 I can&#x27;t find any ZIO documentation for this specific case or any way to handle websocket connection manually like a WebSocketBuilder. Currently, I&#x27;m using the standard way of opening a WebSocket channel with ZIO:
  val httpSocket: Http[Any, Throwable, WebSocketChannelEvent, Unit] &#x3D; Http // Listen for all websocket channel events .collectZIO[WebSocketChannelEvent] { ... } val app: ZIO[Any with Client wit…</span>

                              <span>Hey, 
 I tried the Helix editor today (I know, I know...) and out of the box it has this really nice looking feature where it not only colors the keywords for syntax highlighting but also give certain keywords a different font. 
 See here for an example: https://abload.de/img/screenshot2023-04-181tzc7w.png (the fn and the main keyword)
 Now, the same code snippet in my emacs looks like this: https://abload.de/image.php?img&#x3D;screenshot2023-04-181ksiav.png
 Does anyone know how to get these?
 I am using Doom Emacs with emacs 29, I installed the treesitter package from doom. (I know it is built in in emacs 29, but this was still active from my config from emacs 28)
 I active treesitter with &#x60;(global-tree-sitter-mode)&#x60; and &#x60;(add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode)&#x60; in my config.el.

                              <span>There was a problem that intrigued my mind which i solved lately.
 I have many org files under a Dropbox directory. And also i have a scratch.org file on my desktop. I have wanted an easy way to refile all headings from scratch.org file to files in dropbox. I thought of an elisp form at the top of the file which will act like a button by evaluating with eval-last-sexp command.
 I also wanted this refiling thing for the files in Dropbox. Every file would refile to a specific file.
 I couldn&#x27;t create those elisp forms that will act like buttons easily. It was harder than i thought. I found org-refile function hard to work with programmatically. 
 After wasting so much time about this problem, i found a rather simpler and maybe even intuitive solution.
 I add local variables to each org file. An org-refile-targets and org-archive-location variable for every file. This solution doesn&#x27;t give a one click way to refile all headings to a file, but it does give a simpler and focused way to refile and archive headings to specific org-files. 
 I found this solution very satisfying for my workflow. If is there anyone wasting 4 months in order to setup their essential org workflows, i hope this helps.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve found my GTD someday-maybe file hard to manage. So I want to try a new trick to improve things:
  
Capture someday-maybe items as entries with a date 2 weeks in the future
 I evaluate everything in that file every week. If I want to keep the item, I promote it by either moving it to another file, or removing its timestamp.
 For each item, if I haven&#x27;t promoted it by the time its timestamp rolls around, then org-mode deletes the entry
  
This means I want a plugin or a command or something that will delete items with expired timestamps. I looked through the org manual, and found C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s (https://orgmode.org/manual/Moving-subtrees.html) that will archive items under these circumstances. I want to delete them.
 I suppose I could set up the archive file to be /dev/null ! I&#x27;ll try that and see what happens.
 [EDIT] I tried to set #+ARCHIVE: /dev/null::%s at the top of the file in question (someday.org), but when I archive using C-c C-x C-a it sends it to ./someday.org_archive instead.
 [EDIT2] I just made it re-read the file and tried again, this time I got the answer that /dev/null isn&#x27;t going to work :( File exists, but cannot be read Copied: Subtree(s) with 19 characters funcall-interactively: Buffer is read-only: # 
 [EDIT3] I&#x27;ve made peace that someday.org_archive is workable - I&#x27;ll just think of it as landfill. So where I&#x27;m stuck currently, is to make org&#x27;s capture template set a date 2 weeks in the future when I capture an item to someday.org. I looked through the org manual&#x27;s entries on capture templates again, but it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s an answer for this.

 This feature is present in Doom Emacs, and when I switched to GNU emacs, I found that I was quite fond of that feature, so I made it here. You can finally do [[https://gaodean.me/gen/cat.jpg]], and have it display inline just like local images. The code here is adapted from the Doom Emacs codebase, and I just thought to make a small plugin to make it simpler to use for GNU emacs users.

                              <span>For the last year or so I&#x27;ve been trying editors and environments to see what fits me. 
 I installed doom emacs and really quite fell in love with it. But I couldn&#x27;t make an Emacs config from scratch. Just wasn&#x27;t a task I could do. It would take maybe a week worth of effort to me.
 Just this weekend I decided I&#x27;ll give neovim a chance. I started making my config from scratch and found it MUCH easier. Followed some videos and after 2 days I have something I really like and more importantly I understand every snippet of code that went into the config.
 I miss some things. The commands pallete on doom was amazing. Every command, every keymap all just there. Magit is a godsend. So is org mode.
 I have no doubt I will eventually hop back to emacs but neovim has given me the confidence to be able to write my own config. 
 What do you guys think?

                              <span>I am in the process of converting the last of my vim config to emacs evil-mode, and for latex editing, i have these commands to automatically insert latex code, with jump markers i can jump to, this is what i have so far, but it does not seem to work.. i get an error that says wrong number of arguments: (2 . 2), 4
 this is my code:
 (setq JMP &quot;(;JMP;)&quot;) (defun th/jump-to-mark () &quot;Jump to next occourence of the jumpmark&quot; (isearch-forward JMP) (kbd &quot;da(&quot;)) (eval-after-load &#x27;tex-mode (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd &quot;;&quot;) &#x27;th/jump-to-mark) (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd &quot;;bf&quot;) (concat &quot;\\textbf{&quot; JMP &quot;} &quot; JMP)) (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd &quot;;it&quot;) (concat &quot;\\textit{&quot; JMP &quot;} &quot; JMP)) ) 
 Anyone know what is wrong? 
 Or if you have an alternative method of achieving this?

 I&#x27;d like to have project.el only add &amp; remember project root directories that I explictly ask it to. Ideally I&#x27;d like to disable using any project root heuristics. Is this possible in emacs 29?
 Note that I don&#x27;t want to use projectile because I&#x27;m reliant on eglot, which integrates with project.el, and I&#x27;d also prefer to avoid another dependency if I can.

                              <span>Hi Haskell community!
 I am quite stuck with trying to think of a way to implement a createDecisionTree function. But first, some background!
 Here&#x27;s the DecisionTree datatype, which is pretty much just a Rose Tree
 data DecisionTree a &#x3D; DecisionTree a [DecisionTree a] deriving Show 
 I am trying to explore the Decision Tree of a game by modelling the different states one can take from a particular state
 possibleGameStates :: GameState -&gt; [GameState] 
 There&#x27;s a possibility of a lot of overlapping GameStates, so I introduced a Set into the picture
 uniqueGameStates :: SET.Set GameState -&gt; GameState -&gt; ([GameState], SET.Set GameState) uniqueGameStates alreadyExplored g &#x3D; let allPossFiltered &#x3D; filter (\x -&gt; not (SET.member x alreadyExplored)) $ possibleGameStates g newSet &#x3D; SET.union (SET.fromList (g : allPossFiltered)) alreadyExplored in (allPossFiltered, newSet) oneLayer :: SET.Set GameState -&gt; [GameState] -&gt; ([[GameState]], SET.Set GameState) oneLayer s [] &#x3D; ([[]], s) oneLayer s (g : gs) &#x3D; let (iRes, newSet) &#x3D; uniqueGameStates s g in (iRes : fst (oneLayer newSet gs), newSet) 
 I want to write a createDecisionTree function 
 createDecisionTree :: SET.Set GameState -&gt; GameState -&gt; DecisionTree GameState 
 But I have no idea how to compose oneLayer together with uniqueGameStates to create the DecisionTree. Oh, and btw, I have a inEndState :: GameState -&gt; Bool function as well for the base case of createDecisionTree. I have no idea what the recursive case looks like. Help!

                              <span>I might be in a little over my head as I&#x27;m just playing around with my first few non-tutorial lines of PureScript.
 I want to parse a simple line with a Regex.
 Regex match will return a Maybe (Array (Maybe String)). I&#x27;d like to lift the inner array. Is there a library function that does Array (Maybe a) -&gt; Maybe (Array a) (or even Array m a -&gt; m Array a)? I can&#x27;t find anything with that exact signature on pursuit, but I&#x27;m not crazily experienced using it... ;)
 Also, is this a very bad approach? My target files have some lines matching the regex and others that don&#x27;t. A valid line will match all groups, and I need to access all of those groups individually in the next step.
 I&#x27;m also not that fluent yet in the group theory speak...

I press the + (plus) to zoom in and scrolling still works fine at a good speed, however once I start zooming out by pressing the - key, then scrolling becomes laggy and continue to be like that until I close the PDF. Any idea why this happens?

                              <span>I was looking for a way to use a single transient menu in such a way that I&#x27;d be able to have the same exact menu displayed but bind the whole menu to either one set of commands or the other set of commands.
 Eventually I ended up creating a top-level menu that redirects to one of two transient menus depending on state. It feels ugly but I haven&#x27;t found a better way to do this. Is this how it&#x27;s done? Did I miss a critical feature of transient somewhere? (we can ignore the discrepancy with the &quot;stop processing&quot; for this conversation).

                              <span>I have the code below which is essentially taking a list of all open buffers that aren&#x27;t the fundamental buffers, and putting that list in a sidebar. The issue is it doesn&#x27;t update when a buffer is opened or closed. So I added in (add-hook &#x27;buffer-list-update-hook #&#x27;my/display-buffers) which I thought would call my function and update it when a new buffer is opened. Though after adding this I can&#x27;t use any command (C-x C-f, M-x, etc) and it causes Emacs to freeze. What am I doing incorrectly here?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a new convert from vim and am so far quite enjoying my time in emacs. I&#x27;m managing connections between several pieces of software for knowledge management (Zotero and logseq ATM, maybe org-roam later on) and have cobbled together some search and replace regexes that I&#x27;ll use repeatedly and are long enough to not want to retype, so I&#x27;m wondering if emacs has a way to save these as a function or something similar. I can use the command history with up &amp; down, but that could be mighty slow if I haven&#x27;t used them in a while. An example would be something like: 
  %s/.zotero.*page&#x3D;\([^&amp;]+\).*)/)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:ls-type: annotation\n:hl-page: \1\n:hl-color: yellow\n:END:/g 
 if I could give this a simple name or even turn it into a function that I could tab-complete down the line, I would be a very happy guy. Any ideas?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I’m a total beginner with emacs, but liked the aesthetics of Doom and decided to give it a go.
 After installing Doom, I un-commented the &#x60;minimap&#x60; line in &#x60;init.el&#x60; to enable the package, ran &#x60;doom sync&#x60; in my terminal, started emacs again and enabled the minimap inside emacs with &#x60;minimap-mode&#x60; but all I’m getting is a small buffer at the right of the window, with an exact duplicate of the main buffer.
 Tried this with various files, same result. I’m using iTerm2 on macOS with Emacs 28.2.
 Any idea what’s wrong?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve tried LSP so many times and I&#x27;m too frustrated with how difficult and hard it is to configure. Trying to look at other people&#x27;s configs for this is a nightmare.
 I wanted to ask: Does anyone have an Emacs config that configured LSP or Eglot mode along with proper indentation that &#x27;just works&#x27; for the following modern web development frameworks and languages:
  
React
 Vue
 Ruby On Rails
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 Python
 HTML
 CSS
  
​
 Anything related would be wonderful as I&#x27;m sick of trying to fight Emacs to even get this to work properly, even when indentation is concerned.

                              <span>I was using emacs within tmux over ssh, but I&#x27;d like to use emacs and multi-vterm within emacs instead.
 I&#x27;d like to be able to continue from a session (window/tab layouts) when I reconnect over ssh.
 Is there some way to get emacs to save the previous session so that when I ssh back (after disconnecting) I could continue from a previous emacsclient session the way tmux allows attaching to an existing session?

                              <span>I know TRAMP slowness is a recurring topic here, but I didn&#x27;t see a suggestion on this particular phenomena yet, so asking for advice.
 When I connect to a host at work, TRAMP is trying to find version control configuration all over the file system on the remote host. Git / Bzr / Hg / Svn, in current directory, one directory up, and up, and up... I can trace it in the debug buffer it is taking more than a minute to finish this process which is awkward. I am working from Eastern Europe via VPN, and the remote host is in the US, so it takes a couple of hops while one command completes.
 Is there any way to prevent these checks? I care about version control on my local machine only.
 Thanks.

One inconvenience is that when I run &#x60;helm-find-files&#x60; under a Windows mount (e.g. /mnt/c/Users/me/Downloads) once, then I later add a file under that folder, and then I run &#x60;helm-find-files&#x60; again, the latter doesn&#x27;t seem to update and show the latest files added. Dired and shell work correctly. Also regular files under ~/ work as expected. What could it be? And how could I have an up-to-date output with &#x60;helm-find-files&#x60; even in mounted dirs? Thanks!

                              <span>In a Vanilla Emacs config, i see some bootstrap messages (Like load *package*.....done) and then i can use Emacs. 
 ​
 In Doom Emacs, the frame appears as soon as Emacs becomes ready for usage. How is that? Doom Emacs says it took 0.7 seconds to startup, while my vanilla emacs config took 0.37 (i already tweaked early-init), so i guess the DOOM Emacs&#x27; devs have configured it so that either the messages do not appear in the echo area or the frame appears only when emacs becomes ready for usage. 
 ​
 How is it possible?

                              <span>For my own reasons, I&#x27;ve come to use the di- prefix to mean half, in opposition to bi- meaning twice. This has affected me in that difunctor seems to be an older / alternative term with the same meaning as profunctor, as is evidenced by the Profunctor class itself:
 haskell class Profunctor p where dimap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (c -&gt; d) -&gt; p b c -&gt; p a d lmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; p b c -&gt; p a cw rmap :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; p a b -&gt; p a c 
 It is actually quite awkward, this straddling of both pro- and di-. The type class name uses the pro- terminology (as in pre, and post), but the functions use the di-, l-, and r- terminology. This is unfortunate, as the Profunctor thus claims essential parts of both terminologies.
 For quite some time, I&#x27;ve actually thought of these in my head as promap, premap and postmap, as I have my own orthogonal use case for the di- nomenclature, having derived another dimap (and rmap, lmap) - but they clash in name with the existing profunctor functions, even though prodifunctor and prodimap in my nomenclature are actually sensible classes worth exploring. Privately I&#x27;ve been content with masking this, as I have alternative ways of deriving names, but I thought it was worth discussing with the community.
 What are your thoughts on the positives and consequences of changing the Profunctor nomenclature such that dimap &#x3D; promap, lmap &#x3D; premap, and rmap &#x3D; postmap?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am curious as to what colors you use for the different levels of headings and if there is some logic behind it...
 Do you simply pick random colors based on gut instinct or do you subscribe to some color theory?
 Or do you differentiate the different levels in another way - using different font-sizes maybe? Or maybe different fonts AND different colors?
 What is your style and why (I am looking for some inspiration...)?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I recently migrated from straight to elpaca. I&#x27;m generally very pleased with the results, but there is one issue I don&#x27;t know how to resolve, even after reading the manual and trying various searches online. The issue is pretty simple: I don&#x27;t seem to be able to get elpaca to load updates to any use-package expression after Emacs has started.
 For example, let&#x27;s say I want to set the value of the user option org-hide-emphasis-markers to t in my config file. I then add (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) to the use-package section of org-mode:
 elisp (use-package org :demand t :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)) 
 (Assume for simplicity that I have no other org-mode customizations.)
 To test the effects of this change, I run eval-last-sexp with point at the end of the macro. However, nothing happens: the new value is not set.
 I thought this may be related to the asynchronous nature of how elpaca handles packages. But evaluating (elpaca-process-queues) has no effect.
 Apologies if I&#x27;m missing something obvious.

 🤮 What is this indentation style?!
 And trust me, I&#x27;ve tried every possible value for c-ts-mode-indent-style; I&#x27;ve tried gnu, k&amp;r, linux, and bsd. Ideally, I would like emacs to indent my code like this:

 A LOT better
 How would I achieve the indentation style of the lower image?

 How do I adjust the vterm specific colors for my custom theme so that ncurses programs like Midnight Commander don&#x27;t create such blinding color combos?

                              <span>Hi all, I was wondering how scala can be applied to have some fun with the hardware embedding SoC like Raspberry PI, Orange PIs, Jetson nano and similar devices.
 Specifically, a C/C++ programmer may have some fun using OpenCL, vulkan or coda on NVIDIA hardware. I know that there are bindings for scala to many of these libraries but honestly I don’t see using them in a functional context to add much wrt the imperative way, instead they tend to be more limited in scala.
 Even more, recent devices like rk3588 are equipped with a NPU, is there a way to have fun with it with Scala?
 What’s your thoughts about this? ZP

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been playing around with recursion schemes and I have a question regarding re-using logic between different folds.
 For example, say we have a simple expression language...
 data Expr &#x3D; Num Int | Add Expr Expr | Mul Expr Expr makeBaseFunctor &#x27;&#x27;Expr 
 We can define a &quot;debug print&quot; for an Expr which prints its tree structure. Taking inspiration from the example from the recursion-schemes docs, we can use an effectful fold in Reader that keeps track of the current depth:
 type Depth &#x3D; Int debugPrint :: Expr -&gt; String debugPrint e &#x3D; runReader (cata debugAlg e) 0 where debugAlg :: ExprF (Reader Depth String) -&gt; Reader Depth String debugAlg e &#x3D; do depth  (&quot;Num &quot; ++ show n, []) AddF e1 e2 -&gt; (&quot;Add&quot;, [e1, e2]) MulF e1 e2 -&gt; (&quot;Mul&quot;, [e1, e2]) ss…</span>

 Failed to verify signature markdown-mode-2.5.tar.sig: No public key for 0*************** created at 2022-02-11T16:05:05-0600 using RSA Command output:gpg: keyblock resource &#x27;~/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx&#x27;: No such file or directory 
 When I went and checked the folders, there was no ../elpa/gnupg/ folder, only the folder ../elpa/gnu-elpa-keyring-update-2022.12/ was there. I tried the solution suggested here, but the same error persisted.
 After that I tried package-refresh-contents, and I began to receive Failed to download &#x27;melpa&#x27; archive and also package Not found errors. So as a result of this I am unable to install any packages on my Mac M2 Air.
 Please help me fix this

 I get a hyperlinked TOC where each item in the TOC is colored blue. I know I could replace #+options: toc:t w/ #+latex: {\hypersetup{linkcolor&#x3D;black}\tableofcontents} but I&#x27;m wondering if there is something I can put in my configuration file to make this automatic. Thanks.

                              <span>There are packages that contain multiple .el files (*features*). One example is org mode.
 ​
 There are also built-in features that are considered packages from &#x60;(package-installed-p)&#x60;. One example is delsel:
 ​
 (package-installed-p &#x27;delsel) -&gt; non-nil
 ​
 Is there a way to get the package that owns a certain feature? Also, why do some built in features count as packages?

                              <span>I am using the latest version of doom emacs and have tried everything I could find on google.
 When I run org-roam-ui i get the following error:

 and this resolver: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/20/18.yaml
 but then stack complains about adding Win32-2.13.4.0 to extra-deps, which results in bunch of errors like this
  In the dependencies for aeson-2.0.3.0: time must match &gt;&#x3D;1.6.0.1 &amp;&amp;  aeson-2.0.3.0 
 after adding all that to extra-deps i get
  Dependency cycle detected in packages: [Cabal,Cabal-syntax,Cabal,entropy,crypto-api,RSA,authenticate-oauth,req,script] In the dependencies for Cabal-syntax-3.6.0.0: Cabal dependency cycle detected: Cabal, Cabal-syntax, Cabal, entropy, crypto-api, RSA, authenticate-oauth, req, script needed due to script-0.1.0.0 -&gt; Cabal-syntax-3.6.0.0 
 I would be very thankful if someone could offer some ideas on how to try to solve this.

                              <span>A new release of SBV is now on hackage, supporting quantifiers, quantifier alternation, quantifier elimination, and skolemization. This allows users to express and prove first-order logic theorems. (Of course, the underlying solver---typically z3---may not be able to determine theoremhood, since first-order logic is semi-decidable. However, modern SMT solvers can handle most instances that come up in practice.)
 Here&#x27;s a simple example:
 Prelude Data.SBV&gt; :set -XDataKinds Prelude Data.SBV&gt; sat $ \(Forall @&quot;x&quot; x) (Exists @&quot;y&quot; y) -&gt; y .&#x3D;&#x3D; (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable Prelude Data.SBV&gt; sat $ skolemize $ \(Forall @&quot;x&quot; x) (Exists @&quot;y&quot; y) -&gt; y .&#x3D;&#x3D; (x + 1 :: SInteger) Satisfiable. Model: y :: Integer -&gt; Integer y x &#x3D; 1 + x 
 A set of first-order-logic examples are included in the release. As usual, bug reports, comments, and contributions are most welcome at the github repo.
 Happy proving!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve developed pure Haskell quicksort on mutable vectors while aiming to match performance of std::sort from C++. While not really hitting that bar, the result is within around 20% in sequential mode and is faster in parallel mode.
 In addition, the package exposes reasonable default sort for most users suitable for just importing and sorting without thinking twice what&#x27;s going on under the hood.
 Parallelisation is implemented via both sparks and threads and the method is selectable. Unfortunately threads don&#x27;t show much speedup but users can define ther own, hopefully faster, methods to parallelise. Sparks-based parallelisation is much faster but unfortunately will use all available capabilities at runtime so it&#x27;s less controllable.
 The repository is https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort and the benchmarks are under https://github.com/sergv/vector-quicksort#benchmarks.

                              <span>I defined an assignment to make an alias for switching some functions. 
 So I wrote a code like below.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hs -- Please ignore details of function body. This code is just for my interest but not for production
 fun :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool fun xs &#x3D; xs &#x3D;&#x3D; reverse xs
 -- This is my intention funAlias &#x3D; fun 
 data1, data2 :: [Int] data1 &#x3D; [1, 2, 3] data2 &#x3D; [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
 data3 :: [Char] data3 &#x3D; &quot;madmimadam&quot;
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do print $ funAlias data1 &#x3D;&#x3D; False print $ funAlias data2 &#x3D;&#x3D; True print $ funAlias data3 &#x3D;&#x3D; True &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And I got errors.
 sh src/06.hs:19:17: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Char’ with ‘Int’ Expected: [Int] Actual: String • In the first argument of ‘solve’, namely ‘data2’ In the first argument of ‘(&#x3D;&#x3D;)’, namely ‘solve data2’ In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘solve data2 &#x3D;&#x3D; True’ | 19 | print $ solve data2 &#x3D;&#x3D; True | ^^^^^ 
 I (maybe) understood I can&#x27;t define an alias of polymorphic function but I can&#x27;t figure out what is happend actually. 
 Please show me what is wrong. And making an alias of function is bad manner in Haskell?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have come across Alex(https://serokell.io/blog/lexing-with-alex) and Happy which are libraries for scanning tokens and parsing but as a beginner I would like to look at code that uses Haskell directly. There is a toy grammar for this.My goal is to learn FP for this use case so that I can use the new pattern matching features using records in Java.
 I can compile and execute Haskell( or Ocaml ) in Spacemacs.
 Is there a book for that ? I know about Appel&#x27;s books. I am particularly interested in patterns like zipper which I have already coded. Are similar patterns useful for parsing and scanning ?
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>I had a case where I wanted to combine a bunch of tables from many org files. In my case they&#x27;re hardware specs for computers, but the general idea is take a two-column (| key | value |) table from a bunch of independent org files and combine it into one big table.
 Some of the examples I found before used #+INCLUDE statements to grab the table like:
 #+NAME: calamity-hw #+INCLUDE: ./calamity.org::#hardware :only-contents t 
 but I didn&#x27;t like having to keep this list updated even though it only required executing re-executing a code block. It also required passing each table as a variable into the code block for generating the big table like:
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :var chaos&#x3D;chaos-hw devil&#x3D;devil-hw ...

 Also keep an eye out of Daniel Ciocîrlan&#x27;s recent Scalar Conference 2023 talk when hits YouTube. (Hopefully soon, I hear good things and can&#x27;t wait to see it!)
 If you&#x27;d prefer to read about it, Gabriel Volpe&#x27;s brilliant new book &quot;Functional Event-Driven Architecture&quot; includes a bonus chapter featuring Tyrian, in which he ports his trading app from Elm to Tyrian.

 Many thanks, as always, to Tyrian&#x27;s contributors and community. I love it when people drop into our little Discord server to show us what they&#x27;ve been building!
 (* Please note that while the course and book mentioned above are both based on the Typelevel and Cats Effect ecosystem, Tyrian works with any compatible effect type, and we have a small but growing number of Tyrian+ZIO users too.)

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m trying to find a concise name for a special pattern of using return type values as a place to collect evidence about an underlying implementation.
 The essence of the pattern is to replace what would usually be Unit with a new, distinct type. On the trait definition level, the return type is kept abstract, so that each implementation can decide for itself what it means for it to be correct. On the implementation level, however, the type is defined such that it enumerates what evidence is necessary to consider this specific implementation correct. When multiple levels of traits/implementations are at play, the evidence is propagated from level to level in its abstract form.
 The following example should give you a general idea of what I&#x27;m talking about:

 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library enabling developers to attach constraints (also called &quot;refinement&quot;) to types. These constraints are evaluable at compile-time and/or at runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 //OK val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -4 //Compile-time error! val z: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -4.refine //Runtime exception. Variants for &#x60;Option&#x60;, &#x60;Either&#x60; etc... exist 
 Check the Github page for more information.
 Features of v2.1.0
 New error messages
 Iron now has enhanced compile-time errors, clearer and more explicit.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def log(x: Double :| Positive): Double &#x3D; Math.log(x)
 log(-1)  scala -- Constraint Error -------------------------------------------------------- Could not satisfy a constraint…</span>

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m looking to migrate to vanilla emacs, and I thought I&#x27;d kick things off by asking you all for advice.
 I&#x27;m terrible at emacs, but I&#x27;ve been managing to limp along with it as my primary driver for a good number of years now. I used vim for many years, but then I switched to spacemacs for some time and moved on to doom a little while back. I absolutely love the idea of a modal space menu, and the evil integrations have been fantastic for me.
 BUT. Even though they&#x27;re great projects, I&#x27;d really like to be done with things like spacemacs and doom. They&#x27;ve been a great way for me to see what&#x27;s out there, but all the built-in customization makes it really hard for someone like me to understand where various behaviors are actually coming from, and at least a few times I&#x27;ve discovered that after much hair-pulling what I thought were plugin bugs were actually problems with the customization layers. I feel like I always end up stripping away as many of the customizations as possible.
 My use case is essentially solid support for C++, maybe some python and glsl, and that&#x27;s pretty much it. I know eglot &amp; clangd/ccls work well for the c++ part, which i feel covers quite a bit of what I need. With eglot and things like use-package becoming a part of emacs in 29, I&#x27;m really getting the itch to just build things up from vanilla emacs, so that I know exactly what is custom and what isn&#x27;t.
 External things I know I&#x27;d like:
  
spacemacs-style menu (is this a package?)
 magit
 ranger for file browsing
 evil integration everywhere possible
  
What major headaches do people see lurking here if I&#x27;m keeping things pretty minimal?

                              <span>Dear All,
 I am running emacs on a Linux machine in terminator with a dark background. The default colors are hard to read, with dark blue on black being used for certain faces and I believe emacs is misunderstanding the background color.
 I think I should be able to set frame-background-mode to help with this. I tried adding (set-variable &#x27;frame-background-mode &#x27;dark) or (frame-set-background-mode &#x27;dark) to my .emacs file, and still when I go into emacs it shows the variable value as being nil.
 Any advice on this, and whether this is the right approach?

                              <span>As the title indicates, I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.2 on Windows 11. I&#x27;m required by corporate IT to use Windows, so I have to make this work. I need to get projectile to stop throwing an error every time I navigate to a different file. I&#x27;ve tried googling it to no avail, and the M-x customize window didn&#x27;t have any useful information. How do I tell Projectile to use a different command? And what command do I tell it to use?
 Edit: My emacs config: https://gitlab.com/yramagicman/stow-dotfiles/-/tree/master/config/emacs
 Edit 2: Solved. I have Git Bash installed and was able to add the binaries from that to my Emacs path. Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think about that previously, but it worked.

Here are two basic things that are very easy in vim but I am not sure how to do in emacs. I&#x27;ve tried to look in the manual but I just don&#x27;t seem to grok it.
 ​
 1) Run an interactive command with arguments. The problem I&#x27;m trying to solve is to repeatedly load a file. (Yes, I know about M-x eval-buffer). In vim, I can call the :source command with an argument, for example:
 :source ~/.vimrc
 I can then even type : and hit the up arrow, or :so and hit the up arrow and it will recall from my history similar to bash&#x27;s Ctrl-r.
 In Emacs, M-x load-file (or :load-file since I use evil) doesn&#x27;t seem to accept an argument. I&#x27;m forced to hit RET, and then the name of the file. Let alone not having…</span>

 Am I missing something or is there not documentation for editing the sidebar?

 there&#x27;s a specific type of buffer where I can&#x27;t view non latin characters (hebrew in my case). In all other buffers and minibuffer pop-ups hebrew characters are presented fine, but I&#x27;m using prot&#x27;s &#x60;denote&#x60; package, which creates a backlinks buffer (nvm exactly what that is if your unfamilliar) using xrefs - and the text in that buffer gets displayed withe characters&#x27; numbers, but not the actual letters.
 I have the following in my config file:
 ;; UTF-8 as default encoding
 (set-language-environment &quot;English&quot;)
 (set-language-environment &quot;UTF-8&quot;)
 (set-default-coding-systems &#x27;utf-8)
 (set-keyboard-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-unix)
 (set-input-method &#x27;hebrew-full)
 ;; do this especially on Windows, for python output problems
 (set-terminal-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-unix)
 And I&#x27;m using Doom emacs on windows.
 Thanks for any help!

 If I have a running emacs and connect to the computer with remote desktop (mstsc.exe) on Win10.
 I found the the font is obscure and I have to restart emacs and font rendering will be okay again.
 Do you have any idea how I can solve it without close and run my emacs session ?

                              <span>Today, my emacs started having all sorts of problems connected to utf8 characters. I think I traced the problem back to emacs not opening my init.el with utf8 encoding for some reason. I set utf8 characters as the values of several variables in init.el, and this causes problem in other buffers even when emacs determines the encoding of these other buffers correctly.
 I tried using #&#x27;recode-region and #&#x27;set-buffer-file-coding-system to reencode init.el, but if I restart emacs it keeps detecting the file as &quot;no-encoding&quot;. I also tried using (prefer-coding-system &#x27;utf-8-unix) but that didn&#x27;t help either.
 I&#x27;m out of ideas. Does anyone have suggestions for what else I can try?

                              <span>I have a very simple toy project using spago. I&#x27;d like to add the purescript-postgresql-client library as a dependency, but it apparently doesn&#x27;t exist in the package set.
 I apparently need to add this package, along with its dependencies, to packages.dhall. Should I just be copying the list of dependencies out of the Spago.dhall file from the package&#x27;s repo? If so, why can&#x27;t Spago just do that for me when it gets the package and builds it?
 Also, what happens if the package gets updated upstream and the dependencies change? How am I supposed to keep the list in packages.dhall up to date?
 I&#x27;m mainly used to the Cargo/crates.io ecosystem so apologies if I&#x27;m fundamentally misunderstanding some concepts here.

My week has been wonderful. I got my Python programming project to a stage where I could release it. I&#x27;ve slowly restarted working in the woodshop. My health is starting to stabilize. I&#x27;m getting back in the gym with regularity.  I guess you all didn&#x27;t want to hear all that personal stuff.
Zettelkasting has been slow, and life is distracting. My seminar is wrapping up. Only 2 more classes, a larger writing project, and a public reading left. This will take up much of my time over the next 3 weeks. My seven-day zettel production reflects my zettelkasting speed. Most of the content is ENGL501 Traditions of Food Writing related.

                              <span>How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of your zettelkasting journey.
My week has been wonderful. I got my Python programming project to a stage where I could release it. I&#x27;ve slowly restarted working in the woodshop. My health is starting to stabilize. I&#x27;m getting back in the gym with regularity.  I guess you all didn&#x27;t want to hear all that personal stuff.
Zettelkasting has been slow, and life is distracting. My seminar is wrapping up. Only 2 more classes, a larger writing project, and a public reading left. This will take up much of my time over the next 3 weeks. My seven-day zettel production reflects my zettelkasting speed. Most of the content is ENGL501 Traditions of Food Writing related.

                              <span>Hi community,
 as syntax is contentious a topic as ever, David (the main proposal author) and I would like to invite you to give your input on https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/585, where we propose to change the syntax of the accepted proposal #522 introducing Or patterns. In particular, we&#x27;d like to know
  
Whether you like the syntax ((one of 1,2,3), 4) in the original proposal better than the amended one mirroring case of: (one of {1;2;3},4)
 
Whether you like that it is subject to layout, similar to case of, e.g., 
 f (one of 1 2 3) &#x3D; 4
 Which looks kind of funny here, but perhaps has foreseen use cases.
 
Whether you think it&#x27;s good or bad to allow f (one of {}) (with layout just f (one of), even), and whether the semantics should be a strict match (mirroring case x of {}) or lazy (like case x of _ -&gt; ...)
 
If you have experience with writing tools for GHC Haskell, whether mirroring case of syntax poses new problems for you, especially caused by it being subject to layout rules
 
 (Note that we understand that you might not like either syntax. That is fine, but the linked proposal thread is not the place to have that discussion. In all honesty, the syntactic appearance is not why we like Or patterns, rather the opposite.)
 Thank you!

                              <span>I have been using chatgpt for emacs-lisp programming lately. It is helping me in learning APIs and writing simple functions.
 Today I wanted to write a set of functions to communicate with hammerspoon (the idea is to display in the menu bar the name of the task clocked in, and a continuous update of the time spend in it). I was able to complete my goal faster using chatGPT. When the task is clocked out, reset the menu bar.
 Here is example of what it shows &quot;[0:07] (doing som..&quot; truncated so it does not take too long

 Here are some interactions:

 but I wanted to use advice:

 It is also capable of writing some functions. Here is asking it do some coding:

 Overall, I highly recommend using chat-gpt to increase your emacs-lisp productivity.

                              <span>hello all! i’m new here but no stranger to emacs!
 ever since macOS decided to drop emacs, I’ve been wondering for quite awhile what terminal editor is intended to be used instead? I’ve been focusing on using nano (in both Ubuntu and macOS) for about a year or two and I’ve discovered I can’t unlearn emacs bindings after using it for over 25 years - it takes *more* effort to slow down and translate what I want to do into a nano binding which just doesn’t seem efficient to me (not to mention all the times I’ve had to undo my mistakes!)
 I‘m well aware I can just install emacs through homebrew and just wondering what alternatives exist out there compatible with emacs bindings? [and I’m not looking for anything fancy - 95% of the time I’m just doing basic editing of a config file or README.txt]
 I could have sworn there exists a lightweight terminal editor compatible with emacs bindings included with macOS now and I can’t find any reference to it so thought I’d wave the white flag and post here!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand one little mystery in my init file, but can&#x27;t seem to figure it out.
 I have the following snippet in my init file to add some custom searches for rg:
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;rg ;; Provide some custom searches for Lisp libraries (rg-define-search rg-emacs-lisp &quot;Search the Emacs lisp default libraries.&quot; :dir &quot;/usr/local/share/emacs/&quot; :flags &#x27;(&quot;--search-zip&quot;) :files &quot;*.{el,el.gz}&quot; :menu (&quot;Emacs Libraries&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;Built-in&quot;)) (rg-define-search rg-emacs-elpa &quot;Search Elpa packages.&quot; :dir package-user-dir :files &quot;all&quot; :flags &#x27;(&quot;--glob&#x3D;!*.elc&quot;) :menu (&quot;Emacs Libraries&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;Elpa&quot;))) 
 With that snippet, right after startup, if I call M-: (featurep &#x27;rg) the answer is t. But, if I comment it out, the answer is nil. So that bit is triggering the loading of rg. But, since it is set (with-eval-after-load &#x27;rg ...) I&#x27;d expect this to run only after rg is loaded for some other reason. How does trigger the loading of the package? Is there any way to make these settings while avoiding the loading of rg?

                              <span>I am a long time vim user, just started to use emacs a few weeks ago. And there is a feature I like so much in neovim that I wonder if it is possible to acomplish the same in emacs:
 The file tree displays a sign next to folders that have uncommited changes when in a git repository, and also shows a sign when the file or folder contain some error detected by the LSP. Like in the following image:
 nvim-tree
 Is there a way to do this in emacs? I use neotree, but I would be comfortable using any other file tree plugin if I could get this behavior.
 Thank you very much in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m reworking a document that&#x27;s got numbered headings. It&#x27;s a sub section of a much larger document. As such it&#x27;s numbering doesn&#x27;t start at paragraph 1, it starts at 11-1. I&#x27;m curious if I can tell org export to start the first highest level headings at 11-1, then define how sub headings are handled. In my case here is what the document kind of looks like.
 11-1: Document Title (or more accurately this chapter&#x27;s title)
 INDENTED (1) Some stuff in paragraph form about the intent behind document, etc
 INDENTED (2) Some more stuff
 11-2: Next top level heading
 ​
 Reddit dumped the indentation, so I added &quot;INDENTED&quot;

Are there any downsides or limitations of using Emacs that users should be aware of?
 
Are there any major companies or organizations using Emacs in their development workflows?
 
I&#x27;m currently using productivity softwares (obsidian, anki etc.) Why should I use Emacs tools?
 
What are some popular Emacs packages or plugins that users might find useful?
 
 It will obviously take time and effort to learn, so help me to be sure.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m very new to emacs, my journey has been vim followed by VSCode and now I want to dabble with emacs. I managed to set up evil, which was very straight forward but now I am struggling a lot with everything with typescript. 
 I&#x27;ve identified that I need lsp-mode, lsp-ui, tree-sitter, dap, tree-sitter-langs and tide to have a decent environment up and running. I have the following script setup:
  (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives (cons &quot;nongnu&quot; (format &quot;http%s://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot; (if (gnutls-available-p) &quot;s&quot; &quot;&quot;)))) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) (require &#x27;use-package) ;; EVIL (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1) ;; DAP-MODE (use-package dap-mode) (setq package-list &#x27;(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs)) ;; TREE SITTER (require &#x27;tree-sitter-langs) (require &#x27;tree-sitter) ;; Activate tree-sitter globally (minor mode registered on every buffer) (global-tree-sitter-mode) (add-hook &#x27;tree-sitter-after-on-hook #&#x27;tree-sitter-hl-mode) (setq package-list &#x27;(dap-mode tree-sitter tree-sitter-langs lsp-mode lsp-ui)) (use-package tree-sitter-langs :ensure t :config (tree-sitter-require &#x27;typescript) ) ;; LSP (require &#x27;lsp-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prod-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp) (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;) (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I&#x27;ve installed the packages but don&#x27;t really see anything. No syntax highlighting, nothing. Any clue where to even start?

                              <span>Using pdb from terminal makes it interactive &quot;forever&quot;: after program finished it restarts the script and starting again. Thats convenient. It is posible to use run and restart commands.
 But in emacs via elpy debuger it throws out into simple python prompt when the pdb reach the end of the program. The same when trying to use restart or run command - it goes to simple python prompt.
 How to make it stay in &quot;pdb-mode&quot; after program ends (like in terminal)?

                              <span>Say I have two buffers open, both in insert mode.
 In the first buffer, I push escape to go to normal mode, and then I switch to the second buffer.
 In the second buffer I will still be in insert mode.
 Not really consistent with vim, and annoying if I want to quickly switch back to another buffer but not realising I&#x27;m in insert mode and typing some shit. Now I got to back space and go to normal mode before switching.
 Any simple way to fix this? Both google and chatgpt have been less than helpful.

                              <span>Right now it appears there are only a couple of people working on this project. In the past there were some others, but at no time were there very many. Is it the ugly red-headed step-child nobody wants to see or hear?
 I watched some videos on Scala-Native and saw that the Java libraries which are used to some extent by Scala for the JVM are NOT usable for Scala-Native. Does this mean some parts of them have to be rewritten in Scala? how else might their use in the JVM world be replaced for the Native world?
 Is this a project new people can join? I&#x27;d love to see some good compiler writers join the project to get it moving along quicker.

                              <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Anagrams kata as a one-liner by Mark Seemann
I thought it would be fun to redo the exercise in Haskell and see how compact code I could get away with.
Competitive programming in Haskell: topsort via laziness by Brent Yorgey
In this problem, we have a directed acyclic graph where each vertex represents a person, and there is an edge p -&gt; q when person p sends their finished envelopes to person q.

                              <span>State machines are a common abstraction in computer science. They can be used to represent and implement stateful processes.
My interest in them stems from Domain-Driven Design and software architecture. With this blog post I’d like to explain why I think that state machines are a great tool to express and implement the domain logic of applications.
Moreover, I’d like to present crem, a new Haskell library to build state machines, and explain why Haskell plays an important role in making crem special.

The origin: Domain-Driven Design and state machines
If you are familiar with Domain Driven Design, and Event Storming in particular, you have probably already seen the following picture:

                              <span>hello, I am coming from vim and new to emacs I decided to use doomemacs since it looks easier to configure its working fine and was actually easier than configuring neovim !, but I am facing issue with fonts I am using this line of code
 (setq doom-theme &#x27;doom-gruvbox doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Fire Code Medium&quot; :size 15.0))
 but it seems not to be set globally only on some texts like for example the version on bottom right and name of file opened at the bottom status bar but I want to make it the default font for every text.

                              <span>I have been using emacs for several months at this point. A few months into it, people started talking about using straight.el instead of package.el, so I moved my configuration over to using straight.el. However, now people are saying package.el is the best option and that people should not really use straight.el anymore. I have had good experience with straight.el since some packages I like are not on melpa. Additionally, I have tried downloading and using emacs-29, and it seems to run into issues when using straight which makes me lean more towards using package.el unless there is some way to fix this. Which package manager should I use, and why (I have also heard about elpaca which seems to have nice UI and fixes some issues that straight has, so what about that versus straight and use-package)?

 last year at the same period I wrote some articles about Emacs Lisp and org-mode on this subreddit that I just turned into a website:

 I hope this is useful.
 Have a nice day

                              <span>I was trying to make a backend to xref that depends on external programs and realized there seems to be no way to not block while waiting for a response. I was wondering if there is an alternative framework to xref that wouldn&#x27;t block. Ideally, I am looking for something that would take care of timeouts and would abort calls to async-xref if I make a new one. 
 Or maybe there is a better approach to the problem I have that I haven&#x27;t imagined?

 Does this need additional configuration? I can&#x27;t really find any docs on it either:(

                              <span>I find myself often re-arranging windows especially because I use projectile compilation or deadgrep etc, which pop up additional windows, or replace the one I&#x27;m currently working in.
 I used to use CEDET 15 years ago, and I liked the way it kept the layout fixed, with a lower buffer (similar as to VSCode does it) &quot;capturing&quot; all what could be considered process-output. And then up on top I&#x27;m free to do whatever.
 Is there something comparable? I&#x27;m wary getting CEDET itself into my life, as all its tools seem to be pretty dated.

 But since switching from Emacs27 to Emacs29 it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. The message is:

 Any idea how to solve this?

                              <span>Hey Everyone, I created a curated Scala jobs aggregator FairJoin.com - right now it has 350 Scala jobs from 80 Companies. I created it because I&#x27;ve been a Scala Engineer for the past 10 years and it&#x27;s always been a pain finding jobs that actually use Scala. 
 An example of why it&#x27;s a pain: LinkedIn claims to have 30,000+ Scala jobs, but you click on most of them and they say &quot;Requires experience with languages like Python C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Rust, Go, Scala, or Kotlin&quot;. They just use Scala as a keyword, and you&#x27;ll never actually use Scala in that job.
 With FairJoin I review every job posting to ensure it has a high likelihood of actually using Scala. It&#x27;s early stages, but some of the next features I plan on adding are filters for things like location and Scala specific attributes (i.e. Functional, Akka, Cats, Data Engineering), as well as more company info.
 ​
 I hope it&#x27;s useful, and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts either here or email me at stephen@fairjoin.com

                              <span>On April 20th at 19.30 UTC, I&#x27;ll be speaking with Simon Peyton Jones, one of the team behind Haskell, on a YouTube livestream. 
 Simon is renowned for his work in lazy functional languages, and I&#x27;ll be exploring his career of building languages, especially Haskell, but also C-- and most recently Verse. We&#x27;ll dig into his work at both Microsoft Research and Epic Games, and exploring the lessons we can take from a monumental career. At the end we&#x27;ll put your questions to him in an AMA.
 Everyone is welcome to come and join in and ask questions. You can set a reminder on YouTube.
 The interview is part of Exercism&#x27;s #12in23 - a year long challenge to encourage people to try 12 new languages throughout the year. So far, I&#x27;ve interviewed José Valim (Elixir), Louis Pilfold (Gleam), Cameron Balahan (Go), Josh Tripplet (Rust), and  Bjarne Stroustrup (C++) - they&#x27;re all available to watch back on YouTube!

                              <span>As a short &quot;introduction,&quot; I am a 16 year old student from Canada. I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12, although it wasn&#x27;t much until I was 14. I picked up python initially so I could &quot;show off&quot; to one of my friends, but I ended up getting hooked on writing C until about halfway through last year, in which I started learning Haskell. I&#x27;m firmly convinced that I won&#x27;t leave Haskell anytime soon, as everything just feels superior to how I was doing stuff before, even if it was harder initially (and still, to a certain extent.) I want to eventually work in I.T, but I&#x27;m unsure of the availability of Haskell developer entry positions for once I could actually fathom getting a job working as a developer. I know I&#x27;m young and not locked into using any 1 language / stack, but I&#x27;m still kind of just wondering what I should consider doing for the future? Thanks!

                              <span>I am practicing &quot;intermittent fasting&quot;, and record it as:
 | Date | Start | End | Format | Difference | |----------+-------+-------+--------+------------| | 20230412 | 20:05 | 12:30 | 24:00 | 16:25 | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$4-$2+$3;U 
 My fasting started from 20:05 last night and expects to end on 12:30 today. I firstly tried to calculate the interval by formula &quot;$5&#x3D;24-$2+$3;U&quot;,but it compute a wrong result. So a new column Format 24 hours should be added.
 How could get it done without a cumbersome new column of 24 hours.

                              <span>We all like editing to be fast and transparent. But what are some things that make Emacs slow? Either long start-up, sluggish edits, GC freezes, etc. Things that may be cool, but are rendered impractical by execution time.
 Also if you found a way to speed the thing up, or a faster alternative, would love to hear it.
 (please be kind to the authors/maintainers of slow code as per Rule 2.)

 ;;; foo.el --- Example minor mode ;; Mode developer code. (defvar hello-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-f&quot;)) (defun print-hello () (interactive) (message &quot;Hello!&quot;)) (defun make-my-keymap () (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (define-key map hello-key &#x27;print-hello) map)) (define-minor-mode foo-mode &quot;Foo mode&quot; :lighter &quot; Foo&quot; :keymap (make-my-keymap) (when foo-mode (setq foo-mode-map (make-my-keymap)))) (defun foo-mode-turn-on () (foo-mode 1)) (define-globalized-minor-mode global-foo-mode foo-mode foo-mode-turn-on) ;; User code. (setq inhibit-startup-screen t) (setq hello-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;)) (global-foo-mode 1) 
 I have split the code above into 2 parts. The first part contains the code for the minor mode. The bottom three lines show how the user may use the mode.
 The user wants to set the hello-key to (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) before enabling the mode. But the minor mode ignores this new value of hello-key because it has already used the old value (kbd &quot;C-c C-f&quot;) while defining the keymap for the minor mode.
 Is it possible to create a minor mode in a way that every time the user enables the minor mode, the minor mode re-evaluates its keymap?

                              <span>I want to use a variant of the EXWM function ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &amp;optional id)) to move an EXWM to another workspace/frame.
 Normally this is accomplished with the C-c RET key combination, but in this case the window in question is an EXWM window running under Xpra so it traps the key combination and handles it itself.
 The way around it is to get the window title of the Xpra window from Emacs/EXWM, derive the window-id from it or find it some other way then pass it to the ((exwm-workspace-move-window (frame-or-index &amp;optional0 id)).
 So begins my excursion into finding Emacs window ids, the X window values and those of frames as well.
 Where do I start?

                              <span>As the pretest version has been released, I cloned and built Emacs 29 on OpenSUSE TW. I used the following options:
 --with-native-compilation&#x3D;aot --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;gtk3 --without-xaw3d --with-xinput2 --with-tree-sitter --with-json --without-compress-install CFLAGS&#x3D;&#x27;-march&#x3D;native&#x27; 
 I faced an issue, so I searched and found the following comments on Arch AUR:
  
Native JSON support was removed from emacs sometime in the first semester of 2022. In my tests leaving JSON support out had some breaking bugs that made it a non-starter. I have to test it again before adding such switch to t build script.
  
I checked the official Arch package recipe and found that they do not use the --with-json option. The same is with OpenSUSE official package. However, Fedora package does use that option for their building. &#x27;
 Anyway, I found a tip that running make bootstrap could solve the issue, and it works. Emacs 29 got compiled successfully, and it now runs flawlessly on my machine since morning. Actually, I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was and if it was caused by --with-json option, but I wanted to raise a discussion about whether using this option is not recommended anymore by default.

                              <span>Does someone know how does the css-ls validate the css file? Emacs doesn&#x27;t show any errors for my css file, but when I ran it through the w3 css validator I got an error.
 There is a variable lsp-css-validate which is set to t in emacs. So I assume it does some validation https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-css/#lsp-css-validate
 But maybe the LSP validation is not as strict as the W3 css validator? https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en
 Scenario where I ran into this was that I had written &quot;scale (1)&quot; instead of the correct &quot;scale(1)&quot;. Spent quite a bit of time to hunt this down manually.
 In hindsight I would&#x27;ve spotted the error immediately if I had put the css file through the W3 CSS validator. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll remember this.

                              <span>Many fonts now support this readability enhancement: to display zero with slashes. This is not a different character (such as a slashed o character: „ Ø ”), but a variation of how zeros are displayed. 
 (This can also be enabled in web browsers with JavaScript script extensions such as Stylus, Stylebot etc.). 
 I understand that some people may be not welcoming change (including this one), but this is important for many things, including programming. I kept trying to make chat-gpt understand what code I&#x27;m asking for but it never provides any useful answer, as my current font in Emacs already supports this feature, it is just Emacs which does not make the font display this useful differentiation (variation). 
 Please don&#x27;t be harsh, for now I&#x27;d like to just improve some annoying things in the meanwhile of beginning to learn some more Emacs topics. Regards :).

 fatal: Could not read from remote repository. 
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights 
 and the repository exists.
  
which I believe is standard practice though?
 But in Emacs, using Magit, I&#x27;m not sure how to perform this operation? Simply opening a sell (M-x shell) and running that doesn&#x27;t do it.

                              <span>I have an application where, in my domain types, I have an Event which has many Tags and belongs to a single Venue:
  data Event &#x3D; Event { -- more than this but tags :: [EventTag], venue :: Venue, } newtype EventTag &#x3D; EventTag { tagName :: Text } newtype Venue &#x3D; Venue { venueName :: Text } 
 In the database schema, however, I have tables for tags and venues, and a foreign key relation to the events table.
 I had been using hasql for my database interactions, but found it extremely painful, so I switched to persistent, for which I defined the following schema:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; TagRow sql&#x3D;tags name Text UniqueTagName name
 VenueRow sql&#x3D;venues name Text UniqueVenueName name
 EventRow sql&#x3D;events title Text description (Maybe Text) url URL venueId VenueRowId startDate UTCTime endDate UTCTime origination OriginationURI UniqueOriginationURI origination approvedAt UTCTime rejectedAt UTCTime
 EventTag sql&#x3D;event_tags eventId EventRowId tagId TagRowId |] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What I&#x27;m not sure how to do, is how to insert non-existent tags and venues, and then insert the events, using persistent, in a relatively efficient way. I had done this previously using hasql as can be seen here, which is quite ugly but did the trick.
 I can think of three approaches with persistent, one is to do something analogous to what I&#x27;m doing above: write the tags, collecting the ids and names in a mapping, do the same with the venues, then stitch all this together when inserting the events. This one I do not know how to do with persistent. The other would be to process the events one at a time, inserting the tags, then fetching them again, doing the same with the venue, and then inserting the event. This one I think I know how to do with persistent. The final one would be to write it all as raw sql and process it that way, which I&#x27;m really not fond of as an idea (and haven&#x27;t looked into).
 Any pointers / help would be much appreciated.

 I&#x27;m working on a new project using effectful after having not touched effects in a while. I previously used polysemy and it was a pretty good experience.
 Pawel Szulc once again made a nice talk on using an effect system and it gave me a refresher and some other good information: Effectful | Paweł Szulc | Lambda Days 2022 .
 It&#x27;s perfectly possible to just implement only the IO interpreter and test that while developing with effectful, and for a while I did just that.
 However things became more interesting once I wanted to start testing. So here are rambly thoughts I&#x27;ve had bouncing around that others might want to…</span>

                              <span>My level is pretty poor, but I&#x27;ve been told--and seen elsewhere--innumerable times that it&#x27;s a good idea to start working on open source projects.
 I&#x27;m aware of one particularly friendly project called Bevy, which is a game engine written in Rust. They have &quot;good-beginner&quot; issues and are extremely nice in both the comments and in Discord, and are very active in helping newcomers. 
 I&#x27;d like to not jump into projects that aren&#x27;t able to allocate resources to helping beginner programmers on trivial problems. It would be a huge waste of their time and I assume disrupting their workflow. 
 I&#x27;m mostly just wanting to find projects that mostly meet this criteria. Bonus points if there&#x27;s an active discord/slack community. 
 Any sector is fine, since I&#x27;m trying to branch out and learn what I like. Pretty much any subject goes. I&#x27;m more interested in the coding experience/learning the ropes than anything. It&#x27;ll take time to find out what subject I really like. Right now, I have so much fun coding that the project itself rarely matters.
 My only limitation is that my math background is very poor, so a lot of research-based projects are probably too difficult for me.
 Any info would be really welcome. 
 Thanks :)

Is there a way to make the image appear in dark mode? Maybe I just can&#x27;t see it. Is there a setting in the theme json file? I can&#x27;t find one.</span>

Title should read org-bullets, not bullet-mode. Thank you /u/github-alphapapa.
  
Problem &amp; background
  
New install of default emacs GUI (27.1) on a new EOS 7 install.
 
H4 level bullets are rendering differently to previous 27.1 GUI, they are too big.
 
Examples: Tidy H4 stars on old GUI. New, large flowers on current GUI.
 
 Information
  
Emacs version 27.1 for both. GTK+ Versions - Old: 3.22.30 New: 3.24.30
 
Same config file
 
Same font: &quot;Roboto Mono:pixelsize&#x3D;13:foundry&#x3D;pyrs:weight&#x3D;normal:slant&#x3D;normal:width&#x3D;normal:scalable&#x3D;true&quot;
 
Stars render in the &#x27;old&#x27; way if emacs is launched in a terminal using &quot;emacs -nw&quot;. 
 
 Desired resolution
  
Get the H4 bullets to render in the same way as the old GUI.
  
If anybody has encountered the following issue, or has ideas for how to fix it, the help would be much appreciated.

Is the only solution to actually create one of those marker files in it&#x27;s directory? Or can I configure Projectile to allow me to run that function on these files?

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling to figure out why something isn&#x27;t working on my end as it should be. And now I&#x27;m stuck trying to make sense of the definition of TeX-check-engine. 
 From what I can tell, this function will ask to check the engine only if (but not only if, since there&#x27;s a few other conditions I&#x27;m not listing here) the value of TeX-check-engine-list is set to something other than its default value, presumably to the list of engines required by the file being visited. 
 So here is my question: what is supposed to set the value of that variable? Looking at the docstring, I see that it should depend on what engine is required by the &quot;loaded TeX packages&quot;. But I don&#x27;t see what determines what the loaded TeX packages are, nor how that list is supposed to be updated. 
 (I&#x27;m running into difficulties using emacs -Q after reinstalling auctex etc., so I don&#x27;t see how this could be due to something in my config.)
 If anyone has any pointers, even if not a complete solution, I&#x27;d be curious to know what they are.

                              <span>I am using Emacs 28.2. Here is my code:
 ;;; foo.el (define-minor-mode foo-mode &quot;Foo mode&quot; :lighter &quot; Foo&quot; (message &quot;foo-mode %s in buffer %s&quot; foo-mode (buffer-name))) (defun foo-mode-on () (foo-mode 1)) (define-globalized-minor-mode global-foo-mode foo-mode foo-mode-on) 
 This works like I want.
 emacs -q -l foo.el 
 Then I run these things:
 C-x b *scratch* M-x global-foo-mode C-x b foo C-x b bar C-x b baz 
 I find that all buffers foo, bar and baz have Foo mode enabled. But https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Minor-Modes.html has got this to tell
  
Globally enabling the mode also affects buffers subsequently created by visiting files, and buffers that use a major mode other than Fundamental mode; but it does not detect the creation of a new buffer in Fundamental mode.
  
But in my case, it did work for fundamental mode buffers too. Why did it work when the documentation says it should not have worked? Or the documentation does not say that and I am misunderstanding something?

 Still a work-in-progress, this theme is the result of tweaks over time to the solarized light core. Readability and comfort are the primary goals here.
 Not quite ready for MELPA, but I thought I&#x27;d share here in case anyone is interested or would like to contribute.

 I am trying to correct a problem with a theme I am using. As you can see, the next character in the list of options is practically invisible.
 But I don&#x27;t have any idea where to start looking. I know the file from which the theme is being loaded, and I can modify it. But there are sooo many definitions that I have no idea which one is the one being used.
 What would be the best way to identify the theme class used by this text?
 (by the way, this problem started with my last update to prelude, which I use. I am also using the leuven theme, which I load after prelude).

                              <span>This has been an issue for a while, and I hope someone can tell me what&#x27;s really going on. I use transient-mark-mode and normally it works great. But once in a while it gets &quot;wedged&quot;, where the region doesn&#x27;t deactivate properly after something that should deactivate it. As a concrete example, if I mark a region and hit delete, the region is removed, but not deactivated. So if I move the point, it expands the region again, leaving the mark where it was. And if I just start typing, I only get the last letter, as each letter replaces the previous. The only way I&#x27;ve found to fix this is to exit emacs and restart it.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to figure out what setting gets &quot;bumped&quot; that makes this happen, and prevent it. Failing that, a way to correct it short of not using TMM would be nice. In the worst case, knowing what triggers it so I can maybe avoid it would be better than where I am now.

You are trying to run Emacs configured with the &quot;pure-GTK&quot; interface under the X Window System. That configuration is unsupported and will lead to sporadic crashes during transfer of large selection data. It will also lead to various problems with keyboard input.
  
I think this description is clear enough about what the problem is, but how can I fix it? (I still wish to use gtk.)

 It seems that melpa.org is blacklisted:
 https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action&#x3D;blacklist%3a178.128.185.1&amp;run&#x3D;toolpage
 As a consequence I cannot access melpa from my university.
 There is this old thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iyq75u/my_university_blocks_melpaorg/ three years ago.
 Anyone knows why is melpa still blacklisted ?
 Is there a mirror available ?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve recently updated my emacs to v29 --with-native-comp and I noticed that now when I do C-h f -&gt; consult-grep for example I&#x27;m getting the doc for that function as expected but the link to the source code where the function is defined leads to my packages.el file where I use use-package to install consult. 
 I just checked and I have similar issue with projectile functions too.
 the message says:
 projectile-grep is an autoloaded interactive native-compiled Lisp function in ‘../../packages.el’
 There is no such issue with variables defined by projectile or consult. The issue is there for some packages and for some not. For example orderless functions have no such issue and the doc points to orderless.el as expected. php-mode is fine. Magit has the issue. 
 Have you noticed anything like that in your setup? Is it native-comp related? Is there any way to guide Emacs so it knows where definitions are? It seems like Emacs knows that let&#x27;s say projectile-grep is there, it knows the docstring as well. But for some reason it just points to wrong file. 
 Just for some additional info: - I&#x27;m on MacOS - I use emacs-plus@29 compiled with brew - I use use-package with straight
 Any idea on how to solve it is highly appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>My idea is simple: I want to use emacs as a cross platform window manager: I want to have the same setup for managing windows, regardless of the operating system I am using. One simple idea is to send the windows to emacs and let emacs manage windows, that way I can use the same config everywhere.
 For example, I want emacs to be able to resize photoshop or final cut pro.
 I haven&#x27;t found anything on how to do that on Windows, Mac and ChromeOS.
 Does something already exist to do so?

But the same isn&#x27;t true for text that I copy. So I have to kill then yank, which is a nuisance. I can rebind M-w but is there a workaround I&#x27;m not aware of? Fixes online seem to be about running X in windows but since killed text is transferred fine I don&#x27;t know why that would be necessary...

start-process: Searching for program: No such file or directory, python
  
I tried adding (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;/path/to/python3&quot;) to my init.el and setting my environment variables within Emacs and all of the other suggestions I found online, but still kept receiving the error. I even tried creating an alias for python in my .bashrc and calling emacs from the command line. 
 I finally solved the problem by creating a symlink to python: ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python Hopefully if someone else encounters this issue and searches for a solution, they find this post and it works for them as well.

                              <span>I have a noticeable lag of at least 2 seconds when switching between Emacs frames.
 It only happens in combination of pdf-tools frames. I have the profiler report but I am not sure if it is orderless, vertico or some problem with completion. And the weird thing is that there is no pdf-tools reference at all. 
 Any ideas?
 Side question: Should I just drop pdf-tools from my packages? I have a love hate relationship with it, on one side it is very useful to have all of my pdf files in Emacs, but at the same time scrolling is not smooth and it has a lot of quirks like zoom reset when changing pages or getting stuck on a page. :/

                              <span>I stopped following this subreddit 4 years ago. I heavily use the following packages:
 ivy/swiper, Org-mode, Json-mode, Vterm, Python-mode with lsp, Dired and wdired
 Sadly, I use vscode for most coding tasks however I don&#x27;t spend that much time coding these days.
 What packages do the cool kids use theses days?

                              <span>I have a global, dynamic list of common lisp structs, called &#x60;run_stack&#x60;. I would like a nice way of viewing it. To be specific:
 ​
 - I run a command (&#x60;display_run_stack&#x60; or something), and a new window opens with &#x60;run_stack&#x60; displayed in a special readonly buffer. Each entry of &#x60;run_stack&#x60; should be one line.
 - Each element of &#x60;run_stack&#x60; is a struct with a &#x60;uuid&#x60; field. When point is over a given entry, pressing Enter calls a function (&#x60;goto_uuid&#x60;) on that uuid.
 ​
 The thing I have in mind is something like Org Agenda. Any advice how to program this? Kind of a noob wrt emacs application programming. Not sure where to even start. Example code from some other project would be great.

                              <span>Hello all! Some time ago I published my very first couple of packages, both of them related to note-taking. Having essentially used them for a rather long time, they have proven to be very useful to me and I wanted to share them with you.
 I did not want to write here when I published them, to try and fix any bugs or problems that would arise by their new bundled form, but they seem to be working properly so... here they are:
  
KLP is a general package, focusing solely on making the consistent naming as easy as possible, with a note_category_title.org, template. This allows for arbitrary categories to be easily defined, built and search through. Some use cases for it would be cheatsheet files, easily accessible notes on cli tools ... generally static notes.
 Org-lectures. Now this one, even though it shares quite a lot of elements with KLP (it was developed almost simultaneously) allows for the easy creation and management of courses and lectures files. By assigning a couple of keybindings and complementing it with a package like CDLatex or Yasnippets, a really fun workflow was created that allows me to take (in real time) lecture notes for my university courses.
  
Feel free to try them!
 P.S. My experience in writing packages is limited, so any feedback would be more than welcome (this is the reason why I decided to post here after all, :P). Literate programming files also exist in their respective repos, allowing for easier understanding of these simple packages.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the idea for this post kicking around in my head for a while and decided to write it out. This is written as a sort of guide for someone who recently started learning about functors, and understand how they work in some basic cases like lists and Maybes, but wants to learn a bit more in depth about other kinds of functors. I&#x27;ve put in some more advanced stuff as well which I thought was interesting but that you can safely ignore for now if you&#x27;re actually just learning about functors.
 Most people on this subreddit are probably plenty familiar with functors already, but hopefully this can still help you think about functors or maybe help you help someone who is just learning about functors themself.

                              <span>I have searched online, but this is the best I could come up with, I&#x27;m not sure if it is correct, please correct these definitions.
  
seq :: a → b → b
 Evaluates first argument to weak head normal form (WHNF), when that is completed only then the second argument is returned (ensure arg1 is completed before proceeding with arg2).
 
pseq :: a → b → b
 
 Evaluates first argument to WHNF however does so in parallel using spark, when that is done the second argument is evaluated..
  
par :: a → b → b
  
Evaluates first and second arg in parallel, with hope that arg1 will be fully evaluated by the time its result is needed. It is useful in cases where the evaluation of first arg is expensive and is acceptable to delay its result until later.
 ​
 Now consider this quicksort algorithm:
 import Control.Parallel (par, pseq) 
 parSort (x:xs) &#x3D; greater ‘par‘ (lesser ‘pseq‘ (lesser ++ x:greater)) 
 where lesser &#x3D; parSort [y | y &#x3D; x] parSort _ &#x3D; []
 It will be almost as (in)efficient as the sequential version:
 sort :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] sort (x:xs) &#x3D; lesser ++ x:greater
 where lesser &#x3D; sort [y | y &#x3D; x] sort _ &#x3D; []
 Why is that?

                              <span>Here I defined Service1 with one method with default value:
 trait Service1 { def summarize(arg1: Int, arg2: List[Int] &#x3D; Nil): Int } 
 And this is how I try to test it:
 class Service2(service1: Service1) { def use: Int &#x3D; service1.summarize(0) } object Service2 { def layer: URLayer[Has[Service1], Has[Service2]] &#x3D; (new Service2(_)).toLayer } @mockable[Service1] object MockService1 object tests extends DefaultRunnableSpec { override def spec: ZSpec[TestEnvironment, Any] &#x3D; suite(&quot;example test&quot;)(testM(&quot;fails&quot;) { assertM( ZIO .service[Service2] .map(_.use) .provideLayer(MockService1.Summarize(equalTo(0, Nil), value(0)).toLayer &gt;&gt;&gt; Service2.layer) )(equalTo(0)) }) } 
 Execution failes with this error:
 - example test - fails - could not find a matching expectation - invalid call to MockService1.Summarize.default.2 expected MockService1.Summarize with arguments equalTo((0,List())) - unsatisfied expectations MockService1.Summarize with arguments equalTo((0,List())) 
 I suppose, that creating mock by hand (not using macro) will fix the issue, but is there any other way?

 (I tried looking on google and asking chat-gpt, but there is only about changing the value to t to enable inserting one newline).

 I had to sprinkle in some more lazy until it didn&#x27;t produce stack overflows anymore.
  
Edit 1: When I write lazy val sum the forward reference error goes away and an infinite-loop warning appears. When I write that: &#x3D;&gt; Parser[T2] instead of that: Parser[T2], that warning goes away as well. I&#x27;m going to report back and see if it works with an implementation!
 The problem is that I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing. I just understand that in Haskell, everything is lazy and in Java, everything is eager evaluation, besides stuff like &amp;&amp;, which I guess works &quot;lazily&quot; in Java as …</span>

                              <span>Hi all. Long time lurker here but first time poster.
 I thought this community might be interested in my dissertation. It’s an evaluation of effect systems / design patterns in pure functional languages, from first principles. It operates at the intersection of the academic literature and real world software development. Haskell was the most obvious language for this task, so I used a small program involving four key effects: environment, state, errors and I/O.
 A lot of my time was spent trying to understand the history of the domain and drawing out the most important criteria for working programmers. In the end I settled on: expressiveness, modularity, extensibility, ergonomics and performance. These are the basis for the comparison.
 I don’t expect anyone to have the time to read the whole thing, so this post summarises some of the key take aways: https://www.dantb.dev/posts/dissertation
 I also compiled a list of my favourite resources (there should be a few familiar names from this subreddit… 🙂): https://www.dantb.dev/posts/effects-bibliography
 This evaluation may be useful for people wanting to understand the trade offs involved in selecting tools and techniques in pure functional languages. This was one of my personal goals for the project, as someone who has used pure FP in Scala for several years but never went deep on the theory before. I saw a bit of a gap in the literature regarding the application of these design patterns from the perspective of a software developer, which is what I’m most interested in.
 The structure is broadly chronological and a lot of it is probably old news for experienced Haskellers. With that in mind, I&#x27;d highlight Chapter 7 which contrasts extensible effects with the earlier approaches.
 Comments are open 🙂

I can work my way around a large codebase, but generally I would prefer to work on a more modest sized one if possible. Thanks!

 The compiler is installed and works through the commandline.
 Does anyone know how to change it or an alternative?

                              <span>Hi I use emacs as my window manager and I&#x27;ve been able to define commands to launch applications like thunar or firefox 
 but when I try to use the code provided to launch xterm it crashes my emacs and freezes it up. It&#x27;s the same deal for a few other terminal emulators ive tried. Unsure why. when I use helm-run-external-command I&#x27;m able to launch without problem but its a litttle roundabout and creates it&#x27;s own buffer which is annoying

                              <span>I have a journal I write in with org-capture templates. the template is file+datetree.
 Over time this has become a long file with 100s of entries. The issue i have is finding a specific note.
 I spend far too much time looking for a specific note. 
 How do you organise and search your journal with org mode?

 I am trying to write something that will send notification . I have the exact time when it starts 4/8/2023 at 18:47:10 ( lets call this A.1) and after 1hr40min51sec or 6051 seconds it moves to A.2 than A.3, A4.A5 and last one is A.6 after this ends it goes to B.1 and so on . Can I have emacs send me notifications every time it moves from A to B but also when it moves from A.1 to A2 etc .. I am looking at https://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/index.html and trying to understand what i need to use for this to work. Thank you

                              <span>I use emacs as a daemon. The following code should set Fira Code to be the font:
  (let ((default-font (pcase system-type (&#x27;gnu/linux &quot;Liberation Mono 16&quot;) (&#x27;darwin &quot;Avenir 16&quot;) ((or &#x27;windows-nt &#x27;cygwin) &quot;Corbel 16&quot;) (_ &quot;Verdana 16&quot;)))) (cond ((find-font (font-spec :name &quot;Fira Code&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code 16&quot;))) ((find-font (font-spec :name &quot;DejuVu Sans Mono&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;DejuVu Sans Mono 16&quot;))) (t (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x60;(font . ,default-font))) ) ) 
 However, instead, Liberation Mono is set to be the font for some reason. I thought that find-font would return a list if a font is found, which is truthy, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case. And yes, I&#x27;m sure that Fira Code is installed properly:
 (find-font (font-spec :name &quot;Fira Code&quot;)) -&gt; # 
 The output below the elisp snippet is what I get when I evaluate it.

                              <span>I use wsd-mode via websequencediagrams.com to create professional-looking sequence diagrams from a simple and easy to read markup language. Very happy with it! Way faster to create and edit than draw.io.
 Is there a similar Emacs package to convert from text to professional-looking directed diagrams like decision trees?
 I searched Google, Reddit and Emacs SE and the best I encountered was:
  
graph.el - converts a difficult to parse elisp lists to a similarly difficult to read text diagram.
 a bunch of packages for converting org docs to diagrams of various sorts, none of which were quite suitable for making arbitrary directed diagrams.
  
My hope is my google-fu has failed me and there is a great package I&#x27;ve missed. Also open to non-Emacs suggestions that could be integrated into Emacs with some work.

                              <span>Just a random thought. 
 What if before compiling emacs from source, we somehow integrate my init.el into the sources. The resulting binary will have my custom configuration (+ maybe decrease initial load time).
 Is this thought correct/rational? What are the pros and cons?

 I&#x27;m super excited to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.2! This release also comes with accompanying releases of many related projects: yampa-test (0.14.2), simple-affine-space (0.2.1), yampa-gloss (0.2.1), Space Invaders (0.14.2), and Haskanoid (0.1.6).
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa&#x27;s features.
 This release mainly addresses styling issues. All library code now conforms to the main rules of the style guide we follow (which is publicly documented). We&#x27;ve also addressed other minor maintenance issues, like compatibility with new versions of GHC and some de…</span>

                              <span>static-ls is a low memory language server for Haskell that serves as an alternative to hls with less functionality by using statically generated information. It is intended for (Highly recommend hls instead if you aren&#x27;t having these issues):
  
enterprise sized projects that are either too large or make extensive use of template Haskell leading to high memory usage for hls
 for machines with too little memory where hls can end up using too much memory
  
and provides a small subset of haskell language server&#x27;s functionality namely:
  
Type on hover
 Find references
 Go-to definition
  
Future features I&#x27;d like to implement include: - Haddock documentation on hover from interface files - Diagnostics from ghcid - Autocomplete in scope from hiedb
 It has been tested it on a codebase with over 180,000 LOC and works relatively stably. With a combination of ghcid, an hiedb filewatcher and the -fdefer-type-errors flag you can get pretty solid IDE behavior. Currently only ghc 9.4.4 is supported but happy to personally help people set this up if interested!
 Any feedback is appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the 0.4.0.0 release of generic-persistence! Here is the Hackage Link.
 generic-persistence is a Haskell persistence layer for relational databases. The approach relies on GHC.Generics. The actual database access is provided by the HDBC library.
 New things in this release:
  
A query DSL
 Connection pooling
 A fail safe API that uses Either to safely return all database runtime errors
  
changes:
  
all retrieve* functions have been renamed to select*
 the function retrieveAll was removed. Selection of all entries os a table can now be done with select conn allEntries
  
All new features and changes are documented in the tutorial.
 I&#x27;ve also created a sample project that demonstrates how to build a Servant REST service using generic-persistence for database access.
 All Feedback, bug reports and pull requests are welcome!

 What would be the closest thing nowadays? (Short summary of what I took away from them: Indeed quite low cost for highly competent Haskell consultancy + the questions and answers would, baring for exceptions, be open for others to read.)

                              <span>I use doom emacs and am having an issue tracking down a key binding.
 While in insert mode, I like to use C-h as a binding for backspace since it is more ergonomic. However, while in org-mode, C-h seems to be bound to org-beginning-of-line.
 In order to find out why C-h was behaving this way, here&#x27;s what I did:
  
Open a .org file
 Enter insert mode
 Type M-SPC h k C-h
 This takes me to the documentation for org-beginning-of-line
  
Here&#x27;s where it gets weird:
 Under &quot;Key Bindings&quot;, it only has:
 org-mode-map C-a org-mode-map s- 
 ... no binding for C-h! But that&#x27;s the key I pressed to get to this help page!
 Why does C-h not show up here? Where did this binding even come from? How do I override it?
 I&#x27;ve tried doing:
 (map! :after org :map org-mode-map :i &quot;C-h&quot; #&#x27;backward-delete-char) 
 ... but this doesn&#x27;t seem to override the binding.

                              <span>Hello,
 I’ve been using emacs for a few years now about 3 years. I don’t really configure it much. I use vanilla Emacs.
 But I want to understand the power of emacs and how I can take advantage of it. I was wondering if some of you can explain to me the power of emacs? Thanks

                              <span>I use doom emacs and am having an issue tracking down a key binding.
 While in insert mode, I like to use C-h as a binding for backspace since it is more ergonomic. However, while in org-mode, C-h seems to be bound to org-beginning-of-line.
 In order to find out why C-h was behaving this way, here&#x27;s what I did:
  
Open a .org file
 Enter insert mode
 Type M-SPC h k C-h
 This takes me to the documentation for org-beginning-of-line
  
Here&#x27;s where it gets weird:
 Under &quot;Key Bindings&quot;, it only has:
 org-mode-map C-a org-mode-map s- 
 ... no binding for C-h! But that&#x27;s the key I pressed to get to this help page!
 Why does C-h not show up here? Where did this binding even come from? How do I override it?
 I&#x27;ve tried doing:
 (map! :after org :map org-mode-map :i &quot;C-h&quot; #&#x27;backward-delete-char) 
 ... but this doesn&#x27;t seem to override the binding.

                              <span>When exporting images to multiple formats (I have tried html and pdf), the export works but the image is not displayed. This is only a problem when the image is in a #+RESULTS: block. Moving the image outside the results block fixes the problem. For example:
 #+begin_src jupyter-python :results file :file ~/image.jpg import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt a &#x3D; np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) b &#x3D; np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) plt.plot(a, b) plt.show() #+end_src #+RESULTS: :RESULTS: #+attr_org: :width 547 [[file:~/image.jpg]] :END: 
 will not display an image.
 The problem occurs when using pandoc or org-export. Anyone have any idea how I can fix this?

                              <span>I use zero width spaces as an escape character for emphasis markers. I know it is recommended to use org-entities instead, but (1) I have tried using entities like \ast but they do not appear correctly on export (2) I&#x27;d like to use the actual characters rather than the entity. Does anyone have a function that strips zero width spaces from org documents on export to latex &amp; html?

                              <span>Hi Zettlers,
this is a new idea of mine that I don&#x27;t understand well yet:
The value of a position in chess consists of its probability of victory for the player. Moves are evaluated according to how they affect this probability of victory.
We can apply this to our thinking: knowledge-based value creation consists of enriching data, information, and pre-existing knowledge with value-giving properties. Value-giving properties include: Accuracy/Completeness, Reliability, and Usefulness.
An evaluation of thinking would look like this:1

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m kind of a newbie on configuring emacs, so here is the context:
 I decided to install cmake-ide. It seems that rtags came along with the former. Fine, but I also decided to use the vertico package. It also seems that rtags has a support for Helm, but from what I understand, Helm and and Vertico fall under the same category of packages and therefore I can only have one of them.
 I found this friendly tutorial on how to install cmake-ide and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the customization used in it. I thought that by omit the helm line in the config scope and by changing (setq rtags-display-result-backend &#x27;helm) to vertico would workout with my configuration, but it failed.
 So my question is: is it possible to combine vertico and rtags to work simultaneously?

 (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(,(rx bos (or &quot;*cider-repl&quot; &quot;*nrepl-server&quot; &quot;*cider-test-report*&quot; &quot;*cider-error&quot; &quot;*cider-result&quot;)) (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-direction) (direction . right) (window . root) (dedicated . nil) ;; (window-preserve-size . (t . t)) ;; (window-width . 0.30) )) 
 Now, you can see that I have a couple of things commented because they don&#x27;t appear to work. it looks like I&#x27;m not using the right combination of display-buffer functions. Or maybe something else is wrong.
 What I want is:
  
I want buffers to appear initially on the right side with specific width (0.30 of the frame)
 If I change the position of the window, e.g., move it to the left side, I want Emacs to remember my choice, and when I bury the buffer and pop to it again, I want it to come from the left. Currently, it always pops on the right side
 The same for the width. If I change the width - I want Emacs to preserve it and the next time I pop the buffer, it should not resize the window.
  
Can someone help me tame display-buffer so it works as I want? Thank you!

                              <span>With as much of the following:
  
Statically-typed
 Generates self-contained binaries
 Not Go
 Has a garbage collector
 Not lazy nor extremely aggressive about immutability
 Packaged in most common distros, such as Debian or RHEL
 Good ecosystem for writing CLI tools (nice argument parsers, good support for running other programs)
  
But the on-topic requirement is that it has a great experience in Emacs. As a statically typed language, table stakes is good completion. Also it should not lag Emacs. Not requiring too much fiddling would be nice.
 I think nothing checks all boxes, so I&#x27;m just looking to tick most..

                              <span>I use the standalone ranger file manager on my system outside of Emacs and I&#x27;m used to the various commands and keybindings. I&#x27;ve been using ranger.el for a while to replicate this experience, but unfortunately I keep hitting a bug regarding bookmarks, which I think is related to the enhanced bookmark-plus/bmkp package I use to manage bookmarks. It also seems to get stuck after a while, with multiple copies of the same tab/pane opening if I keep hitting q to close ranger. Additionally ranger.el doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s being actively maintained at the moment, 
  
 I&#x27;ve tried using dirvish, which has the added benefit of being recently updated. The previews seem to work nice, but (I realize this sounds crazy) there seems to be too much going on feature-wise. I keep trying to have the ranger like view with three panels, but dirvish seems to switch to a more standard dired like view despite my config. On top of this, there isn&#x27;t a nice C-h to hide dotfiles and I occasionally get a Selected deleted buffer error if I want to look at a directory I&#x27;ve killed.
  
 Does anyone have a smooth ranger.el or dirvish setup to share, or ways of overcoming the problems I mentioned above? Or a different way to browse files that&#x27;s more robust?

 I installed the first tutor I happened to find, called Monkeytype and do like it.
 The main plus is it has a nice minimalist UI where it shows my progress pretty clearly. The main minus is there&#x27;s no way to open a text file and automatically start tutorial using it. I think it would be pretty easy to script that kind of addition.

                              <span>Hi Emacsers.
 I created a small package for showing overlays in Swift-code/Elisp code. (defun and cl-defun in emacs lisp has basic support too).This is regex-based so it&#x27;s not 100% accurate. But it looks cool.
 https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs/blob/main/localpackages/overlay-usage.el
 Feel free to improve it.
 Swift (SourceKit-LSP Doesn&#x27;t support Code-lenses, so if you have support for that for your language you&#x27;re better off keeping you current solution)
 Enjoy!

                              <span>Hi,
 I work frequently with a (proprietary) application that uses the .Net standard serialiser. I often manually edit these files, as they also contain a DSL embedded in some of the content, that I find easier to tweak this way rather than via the application itself.
 I was considering developing a small prog mode to assist me with some or all of the following features:
  
hide most of the XML boilerplate (but retain the structure)
 display the DSL code, ideally with syntax highlighting. This code is embedded within two XML elements.
 where multiple code elements exist in an XML file, provide some mechanism to display this in a natural way
  
I&#x27;d be amazed if something similar hadn&#x27;t been done previously, so I&#x27;m looking for an example or two that will provide me with a flavour of what is possible.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I usually don&#x27;t post on Reddit, so I apologize in advance if I make some obvious mistakes. I&#x27;ve already asked similar question here on a different subreddit, but I was wondering if there are better solutions.
 ​
 I previously owned a Mac Book 2020 and used Emacs for editing texts. I really liked that the OS X had a global/system wide shortcut that allowed cursor move/act like in Emacs (e.g. C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p C-a, C-e, C-k). For example, I could use the Emacs move for browsers (Chrome/Firefox), File Manager, etc.
 However, I recently had to return my Mac, and purchased a Steam Deck which has a Arch Linux like OS called SteamOS, which does not have the Emacs movements enabled globally/system wide.
 I tried to configure cursor movements/actions similar to the Emacs moves via KDE Custom Shorcut (details of how I configured can be seen here), but this solution does conflict with several applications, and I have a feeling that there might be a better solution.
 By any chance, does anyone know how to configure non-Mac OS (in my case SteamOS/Arch Linux) to have shortcuts similar to the Emacs in a global/system wide manner?

                              <span>Hey.
 Why is agenda not editable?
 Around a third of my workflow is going through filtered notes in a table and adding various things. This is very dynamic - I might want to suddenly have another column in the table (or remove it, or resize it), to add more information, or to not have something clutter the view.
 So far, it seems the agenda is very &quot;set in stone&quot;, and I am going to be unable to do things on-the-fly. Only possible to spend time preparing a view, then use and re-use it.
 Is orgmode really this unflexible?

                              <span>Hello
 I am using org-mode and org-attach via doom emacs. Whenever I have made notes and tried to attach something using either org-download-screenshot or org-download-clipboard, by default the heading has an &quot;ATTACH&quot; tag signifying that there is an attachment in this heading. Example shown below.
 ​

 Now when I try to export this to GFM using pandoc, this is what it does
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/2keyfcri9esa1.png?width&#x3D;1110&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;57aa82093888ea635644fcedc5be3eaf376f21f4
 Essentially it exports the ATTACH tag out. I have a couple of questions.
  
What&#x27;s the purpose behind the &quot;ATTACH&quot; tag? The reason I ask this is because I can easily set org-attach-auto-tag to nil and this tag is not attached and therefore not exported. But does it have other consequences that I might not be aware of. Reading the documentation, it doesn&#x27;t appear so, but I am then left to wonder why this would be the default behavior.
 Is there a way to keep the org-attach-auto-tag to the default value of &quot;ATTACH&quot; but not have it exported. I tried setting the EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS to ATTACH but then of course the whole content doesn&#x27;t get exported.
  
Thanks for your help.

                              <span>I was looking for a workflow where I&#x27;d paste images from clipboard all the time. I figured I could do it with the org-download package like so (with use-package):
 (use-package org-download :ensure t ;; this makes sure the thing is loaded if not present :init (setq org-download-method &#x27;attach) :config (add-hook &#x27;dired-mode-hook &#x27;org-download-enable) :bind (&quot;C-y&quot; . org-download-clipboard)) 
 Which works, until I try to paste text. Emacs freezes completely, and is unusable.
 I realized this also happens if I just call org-download-clipboard directly without a shortcut, when there is no pic in the immediate clipboard.
 So my question is: am I doing something wrong? Is there a simple solution here without having to use different shortcuts?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>The reason I say viable is that it&#x27;s always of course possible. Knowing people can always land you a job and so can incredible luck.
 Often times with niche languages, it&#x27;s easy to get a job despite the total amount of jobs being limited. If no one is applying, the competition is pretty weak or nonexistent. 
 I&#x27;ve seen that many jobs in Haskell are in the healthcare sector. It seems to be pretty standard enterprise stuff that likely was done with Java at some point in the past. 
 Are these jobs, or Haskell jobs (non-research) in general competitive?
 If you were rating the difficulty of getting a job in Haskell as a self-taught programmer on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being a webdev at a no-name website and 10 being a FAANG job), where would you put Haskell jobs?

                              <span>I feel suddently an idiot that I used to code like this to map over a list
 map (+1) [1,2,3,4] 
 Then I felt it is more looking Python doing such
 [ (1 + x) | x  [1,2,3,4] 
 I used to read functor /applicative/monad ref a lot , coud you guys comment my understanding is right on &#x60;Functor&#x60;
 fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b 
 fmap is just a funciton that :
  
describe how to extract &#x60;a&#x60; from the container &#x60;f-1&#x60;
 then run function (a -&gt; b), to get &#x60;b&#x60;
 then describe how to plug back &#x60;b&#x60; to container &#x60;f-2&#x60; ( f-2 doesn&#x27;t have to be same with f-1)
  
The key is : on different types, the effect of fmap is describling how to extract parameter and how plug back the result to a container (maybe a new container with some state change as well ) ?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m a new student to programming and I have exams in a little over a month’s time but since I’m more of a science student most of the concepts aren’t linking as easily to me as compared to the rest of the students. Is there any advice or anything I could do to improve within the next month so I can pass this course? I also do understand the answers when I’m doing questions but it’s just writing and coming up with the functions that is the hard part. 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to configure Emacs so I can toggle entering C- commands with single keystrokes, like god-mode, but the mode quits (goes back to insert mode) as soon as the command completes. Is there a way to make god-mode do this? Or is there another package that can provide this behavior? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;d like to support a couple of Emacs maintainers but I&#x27;m not sure to whom and how much.
 For example I can choose the maintainers of my favourite packages and transfer some money on a regular basis. Is it okay to support many maintainers with less money or should I support few maintainers with more money? Or should I support FSF in general?
 I&#x27;m thinking of $50 per month. So, should I give 10 maintainers $5 per month or 5 maintainers $10?
 I will find an answer for myself but I&#x27;m interesting of how do you handle it.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 28 with tree-sitter.el. I&#x27;m trying to extract import-statements from C sources, and fail miserably.
 I can see the node tree using tree-sitter-debug-mode. But when playing around with queries - either interactively with tree-sitter-query-builder or with code (see below) - I don&#x27;t get any results.
 My code looks like this, and runs:
  (tsc-query-matches (tsc-make-query tree-sitter-require &#x27;c) [(preproc_include)]) (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) #&#x27;ts--buffer-substring-no-properties) 
 The result is  [(0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . []) (0 . [])] 
 Which makes sense given the actual 6 include statements I have in the source file. But apparently no actual contents are extracted. Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hey.
 I&#x27;m just getting started with emacs, and I can&#x27;t even really start because of errors. Please help me stay here.
 I tried the debian package. It is bugged to say the least, and I found out quite quickly (see https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cdei4p/failed_to_download_gnu_archive_bad_request/)I decided to install a newer version, as described by emacswiki (ganneff.de)https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSnapshotAndDebian
 ​
 When apt was installing it, it would throw a much of eager-macro-expansion failure lines, something like
 Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 5) 
 When running it, everything seemed fine, but, when I open a .org file, it throws
 (New file) File mode specification error: (error Eager macro-expansion failure: (wrong-number-of-arguments (3 . 4) 2)) 
 It does not do this if I run it with emacs -Q.
 Someone with a similar issue was https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/74421/eager-macro-expansion-failure-message-when-starting-emacs-28-2-from-the-mac-te , however, there is no fix there that worked for me
 HOME&#x3D;/tmp emacs 
 ^^ This still produces the error, even with an empty tmp.
 sudo apt remove --autoremove emacs emacs-common emacs-gtk 
 ^^ I did run this before installing the new one.
 Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.
 ​
 EDIT: I tried deleting everything again, and installed the snap package. Same issue. There must be something leftover I&#x27;m guessing from those past emacs.

 I want to be able to insert links to all org-roam nodes that contain a certain tag. Is there a way to do this natively or do I need a custom Elisp function for it?
 Does anyone use this functionality who can share the code?

                              <span>I works on windows11&#x27;s native emacs 28.2 and run into an amusing but confused thing with org-babel.
 When I set &quot;sh&quot; as header, something wonderful happens:

 It&#x27;s a bash environment, when change &quot;sh&quot; to &quot;shell&quot;, it print a cmd.exe environment:
 https://preview.redd.it/n89e2r9gw6sa1.png?width&#x3D;673&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;af93c0f94bba7023ac95e67126d154f9a4d9602d
 I did not change the variable shell-file-name:
 https://preview.redd.it/ccmf77uqw6sa1.png?width&#x3D;938&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;9794eefc5cd6dc32158641d99ba7e2788587c345
 additionally not add &quot;sh&quot; to &quot;org-babel-load-languages&quot;.
 ​
 Any variables could determine which shell it invoke?
 The &quot;sh&quot; is what I desire, but I don&#x27;t know why it works？

                              <span>prettychart provides an easy way to view and create charts from ghci. In conjunction with a new release of chart-svg, it provides a means to rapidly visualize and analyse numerical data. For those of you who enjoy live coding or have lots of quick and dirty data analytics to slog through, it&#x27;s worth trying out.

                              <span>Just out of curiosity, I started looking for a usable haskell system for dos (MS-DOS or Free DOS). It is mentioned in several places that there were dos versions of hugs or hbc, but all the links (many pointint to universities FTPs) are broken. Some are so obscure that even archive.org did not deign to make a copy. 
 I found the source code of hbc for linux. Attemps to compile it with djgpp failed.
 So is there somewhere one can get a dos version of haskell these days?

                              <span>How has your week been? What are your plans for the coming week? Tell us about the state of you zettelkasting journey.
My week has been busy with medical issues that prevented me from making many new notes. I feel good now. 
I got my first two essays back from the professor in my food writing class, and I feel good about them. I am of a different generation than everyone else in the class, including the instructor. There are a couple of writers in the class that seem to be able to write a first draft of a &#x27;writing prompt exercise&#x27; that is far more polished than my &#x27;shitty first drafts&#x27;. They are modeling a skill that I aspire to.
While journaling this morning, I found a gem in an entry from one year ago today. It&#x27;s very meta, and this is all very circular.

  
Zettelkasting and journaling are like workouts. You have a busy day ahead. Why journal? Journaling is not just another task. At first, you stumble with form.  Like when you are a beginner at weight training, you struggle with repeatedly getting to the gym. You think it will help your physical health, but at first, you feel sore, tight, and tired, not at all the pinnacle of health. Eventually, if you stick with it, you might find a coach that helps with form, you might set up your environment so going to the gym feels natural, you might start to feel strength building, and you&#x27;ve started progressing on the climb to physical health.
All these weight training actions can be applied to zettelkasting and journaling. They train your mental health in the same way exercise trains your physical health. It&#x27;s a slow process at first. You can&#x27;t see the improvements day to day or even week to week. Improvement only comes with consistency.


I think I&#x27;ll move this gem from my journal to my ZK. I have a couple of relevant notes on the mental health benefits of journaling.

 Why are the horizontals disconnected?
 I was following this tutorial https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-column-view-tutorial.htmlthey end up with it looking like an actual table at one point:
 Connected table
 What gives? Am I doing something wrong? I tried googling to no avail.
 Thanks in advance.
 [EDIT] After using yantar92&#x27;s advice and folding before/after, I managed to get closer to the expected look:
 Space?
 But there is still space between them, although now it&#x27;s not really a breaking issue.

 Is there an equivalent for Scala (before I throw something together myself).

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying out github copilot with this package: https://github.com/zerolfx/copilot.el, configured like this:
 (use-package copilot :straight (:host github :repo &quot;zerolfx/copilot.el&quot; :files (&quot;dist&quot; &quot;*.el&quot;)) :ensure t :bind (:map copilot-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . my/copilot-tab) (&quot;s-n&quot; . copilot-next-completion) (&quot;s-p&quot; . copilot-previous-completion) (&quot;s-w&quot; . copilot-accept-completion-by-word) (&quot;s-l&quot; . copilot-accept-completion-by-line)) :config (defun my/copilot-tab () (interactive) (or (copilot-accept-completion) (indent-for-tab-command))) :hook (prog-mode . copilot-mode)) 
 I had been using corfu and cape for completions with Tabnine (another code analyzer thing.) After disabling these I get the expected suggestions from copilot, appearing as grayed out code that I can accept with .
 I&#x27;d like to get the sort of experience shown in the gif at the zerolfx/copilot.el github page. Short completions pop up in an overlay - I don&#x27;t know if they are multiple suggestions from copilot or coming from another backend - and copilot suggestions appear in gray for acceptance.
 But if I re-enable corfu/cape/Tabnine I only see the overlaid completions, and don&#x27;t get copilot suggestions.
 I don&#x27;t have a good understanding of how corfu does it&#x27;s thing or how I can integrate copilot&#x27;s suggestions.
 How should I progress?

 I want to add my own commands to projectile-commander and I have the following in my init.el. However if do require &#x27;projectile it will cause my projectile-switch-project-action to reset to default. However I need to do require &#x27;projectile else I will get the following error when evaling init.el Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: def-projectile-commander-method
 Why am I getting this error and what is the correct way to setup commands using use-package and projectile?

                              <span>Sometimes, I see people use a combination of use-package and require for third-party packages. For example, I was browsing through aboabo&#x27;s Github repo, and he uses use-package for clj-refactor and require for flycheck-clj-kondo. Is there a general rule of thumb for when to use use-package vs require?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am currently using evil and corfu, but I want to configure such that pressing a single escape will invoke corfu-quit when its UI is active (because pressing &quot;C-g&quot; is harder).
 The problem: even after
 elisp (define-key corfu-map [escape] #&#x27;corfu-quit) ;; yes, I think that won&#x27;t be usable in terminal Emacs but (kbd &quot;ESC&quot;) will ;; complicate a bunch of other &quot;M-&quot; keys 
 In evil insert state, pressing ESC will always invoke evil-normal-state even when corfu&#x27;s UI is displaying. Thus the above snippet is fine without evil, otherwise the key will bring me back to normal state without discarding the popup completion list.
 Can someone tell me how to take over evil in some circumstances such as the above?

 as the default shell as:
 (setq shell-file-name &quot;C:/WINDOWS/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe&quot;)

 The redundant info could be remove from WindowsTerminal by setting &quot;powershell.exe -nologo&quot;.
 but &quot;shell-file-name&quot; is a filename variable, suffix with “-nologo&quot; not work.
 ​
 How could remove the start info.

                              <span>For instance I made some notes of the usage of the Linux netcat command nc, but searching for it produces lots of files containing concat. Even being able to search for nc, it nc followed by a space would do the trick but I don&#x27;t know how to do that in the prompt.
 Using C u C c p s s give an option prompt in the minibuffer where you add the flags you want, -w in this case but that didn&#x27;t work.
 Is there also some way you can see the actual command executed by ag?

                              <span>When I have a Rust file open, I have all the rustic-mode keybinds for things like rustic-cargo-run. But if I have a non-Rust file open (my Cargo.toml, my README, whatever) then the keybind isn&#x27;t present. I can still M-x rustic-cargo-run, but having to remember to do that isn&#x27;t ideal. Is there a package that solves this problem?
 In the worst case I could add a hook on buffer creation that checks if the buffer belongs to a project that looks &#x27;Rust-ish&#x27; (contains a Cargo.toml at project root or whatever) and binds the relevant keys, but I don&#x27;t want to duplicate effort.

 Hi Mods, hope you&#x27;re cool with this.

                              <span>Given: 
 type Image a &#x3D; Position -&gt; a
 type Position &#x3D; (Float, Float)
 type Region &#x3D; Image Boolean
 We would like to create a function that replaces the values of one image with another using paste.
 paste :: Region -&gt; Image a -&gt; Image a -&gt; Image a
 paste reg im1 im2 &#x3D; (\p -&gt; if (reg p) then (im1 p) else (im2 p))
 My question is where does p come from? paste takes 3 parameters reg, im1 and im2. So where does p come from? When using lambda in Javascript for example myList.map(x &#x3D;&gt; x+5), it&#x27;s clear that x is a value from myList. But here I get a little bit confused as to where p comes from.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to list the Org mode apps available and summarize their flaws, harshly. I won&#x27;t have gripes about not supporting obscure Org syntax, or anything like that. Instead, can it read and write Org files? Trickier than you think.
  
Organice - It can&#x27;t access files from your phone&#x27;s filesystem, something that should be simple, but it&#x27;s difficult for a web app. You have to store your notes in 3rd party clouds like Dropbox or connect your own WebDAV server.
 Orgro : read only
 Orgzly - The most featureful. An unfortunate mechanism that can&#x27;t be turned off saves over your file with re-done spacing -- blank lines are added between headlines automatically, which isn&#x27;t Org specification nor everyone&#x27;s style. This clogs git, if you&#x27;re using version control, with changes that are just whitespace. One may notice a toggle to turn off adding blank lines between headlines, but that just means turning blank lines off entirely, forgetting ones that you may have added. Fundamentally, as of now, Orgzly&#x27;s parser doesn&#x27;t try to remember the blank lines in your notes that you may have added with purpose.
 Metanote A newcomer, but it has stayed proprietary.
  
I have more hopes about are full-fledged Emacs with termux or Emacs on F-Droid. None of the org mode apps today are very usable.

                              <span>I recently upgraded from Emacs 28.2 to Emacs 29 (changed Arch Linux packages from emacs to emacs29-git), and now Emacs closes very slowly with my configuration.
 To an extent, I know why this happens (auto-complete adds the function ac-comphist-save function to the kill-emacs-hook). But I fail to understand why ac-comphist-save is suddenly much slower on Emacs 29.
 If anybody has suggestions on why this is happening, or could explain what exactly I will lose by removing this function from the kill hook, I&#x27;d be very grateful.

                              <span>Emacs 29 has got new startup options: --init-directory. Here is how you can use it (for those daredevils who build their own Emacs, until 29 is finalized):
 In your shell, clone those repo(s) you would like to test:
 git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs git clone https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax 
 You can now run your Emacs from command line in respective directory:
 emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/spacemacs&amp; emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/prelude&amp; emacs --init-directory&#x3D;~/scimax&amp; 
 Easy. 
 I actually never tried anyone&#x27;s setup before, but always had on my to-do to actually try those (+ Doom, but Doom seems to require slightly more fiddling). As a small review: Spacemacs and Prelude worked out of the box without any issues. Scimax is a bit older, and for some reason, it choked a bit during the installation. I had to press C-g once or twice to get it going. Also, every time Emacs starts, it is chewing on something until I press C-g. I haven&#x27;t investigated on what. But other than that, despite all the warnings during the package installation, it seems to work quite well. I am impressed with the amount of polish and integration all three has done. I can certainly recommend any, especially Scimax for those of you who are doing lots of org, org-babel and who write scientific articles and reports. Spacemacs seems to be the most polished of them the three, visually and technically, while Scimax seems to be actually most useful, especially if you are an academic.
 If you are new to Emacs and learning, it is not worth spending hours chasing packages and configuring stuff. Install Emacs, and you can be going solidly in less than five minutes with any of those three. Probably Doom to, but can&#x27;t be just cloned and auto-installed via provided init.el as those three guys.

                              <span>&#x60;I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs, so please be forgiving...
 I am trying GNU Emacs both on a Mac and a Windows PC. On the Mac, inserting a date with C-c ! shows [2023-04-04 Tue]. On Windows, it shows [2023-04-04 di]. Both machines have current-language-environment set to &quot;Dutch&quot;. The rest is mostly out of the box.
 It looks like Windows is properly detecting my locale, but the Mac isn&#x27;t.
 I want to use my local language (&quot;di&quot;) instead of English (&quot;Tue&quot;).
 What am I missing in setting this up?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using embark for some months now, I like it, I like the concept, the way it works, and it&#x27;s already part of my workflow in a number of tasks. On the other hand I also find it somewhat overwhelming. The keymaps are very large, and comprise numerous tasks which could potentially be performed through Embark. As a result, unless the binding is already part of muscle memory, having to resort to the embark-verbose-indicator is a time consuming step, because the list is so long it feels like finding a binding in C-h m. True, C-h offers completion, but at this point I&#x27;m already wondering if it wouldn&#x27;t have been faster doing the task without using Embark.
 So, it works very well for bindings I know by heart. Which are a few. For others, I can&#x27;t help but feel I&#x27;d prefer to have less alternatives. Thus, I&#x27;m considering adopting a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to Embark. The idea would be drastically reducing the available Embark bindings, and then adding the ones for which I feel the need. The question is: is there a &quot;proper&quot; way to go about this? I don&#x27;t think nuking embark-keymap-alist to just a few maps is the way to go, since the keymaps put the bindings in the proper context. But, on the other hand, going around disabling each binding seems tedious. So, any advice on this?

                              <span>I keep track of certain reports in an org file and need to record the date the report was submitted. I use a property &quot;REPORT_DATE&quot; for this and then call org-time-stamp-inactive from the minibuffer in order to pass the value of the property in the desired format. 
 I am looking for a way to streamline this process, so that when I call org-set-property and select REPORT_DATE, I don&#x27;t have to manually call org-time-stamp-inactive, but instead I&#x27;m just prompted to select a date (i.e. a way for org-time-stamp-inactive to be called when I select the property REPORT_DATE via org-set-property). 
 I realize I could define a wrapper that would do much of what I need (prompt for a date and then call org-set-property with REPORT_DATE and the formatted output of org-time-stamp-inactive as arguments), but I&#x27;m wondering if this is necessary.
 I&#x27;ve looked into allowed values but, from what I can tell, I can only specify a list of values, which isn&#x27;t quite what I need.
  
EDIT: this does the trick. 
 (defun org-completing-read-date (prompt collection &amp;optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def inherit-input-method) &quot;Like &#x60;completing-read&#x27; but reads a date and outputs an inactive time-stamp. Only PROMPT and DEF are really used.&quot; (format &quot;[%s]&quot; (org-read-date nil nil nil prompt nil def))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-property-set-functions-alist &#x27;(&quot;REPORT_DATE&quot; . org-completing-read-date))

                              <span>I am using DOOM Emacs v3.0.0-pre for reference.
 I have the following lines in my config.el:
 (setq global-display-fill-column-indicator-modes &#x27;( ;; The following modes do not use the indicator. (not special-mode vterm-mode ) ;; All other modes are enabled. t ) ) ;; Draw a line at the fill column (by default 80 chars). (global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode) 
 But the fill column indicator is still displaying in vterm-mode. Can someone please explain to me what I am doing wrong? Thank you in advance.
 UPDATE
 Found a solution. Will only work with DOOM Emacs.
 ;; Show fill column indicator in text and programming modes. (add-hook! (&#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook) &#x27;display-fill-column-indicator-mode )

 So I imagine &#x27;org agenda view in date tree format&#x27; where I can org-cycle every element.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I last posted a post regarding Eask. So I would like to share some of the significant changes since v0.1.0.
 For those who don&#x27;t know Eask, you can treat Eask as a successor to Cask.
 Project repository: https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli
 🎉 Features
  
Unlike Cask-file, Eask-file is an elisp file. You can manage dependencies with elisp code like:
  
elisp (when (version&lt; emacs-version &quot;26.3&quot;) (depends-on &quot;package-name&quot;)) 
  
Node.JS is not required to use Eask; you can download the binary at our release page
 Out-of-the-box linters and test runners (checkdoc, package-lint, ert, buttercup, elsa, etc)
 Work across all OSs (Unless Node.js doesn&#x27;t support it :P)
 Automatically download packages when they are used
 Fast, won&#x27;t start Emacs unless it&#x27;s needed
  
✨ Changes
  
Eask now has all the commands from Cask and more (If Cask works, then Eask works)
 eask status to display the state of the workspace (eask info is also cool! :D)
 Convert Cask-file to Eask-file using eask init --from&#x3D;cask
 eask generate workflow [action] to generate workflow files (support GitHub Actions, GitLab Runner, CircleCI, etc)
 eask generate [type] to generate common files like-pkg.el, -autoloads.el, LICENSE, .gitignore, etc.
 eask cat to display file with highlighting (uses e2ansi)
 Differentiate workspace with flag --global and --config, so you can use Eask as either a general tool or package management tool for your personal configuration
 eask create [type] creates elisp project (package or ELPA)
 webinstall is now available, install it with curl!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m working on using MobileOrg with webdav, but it only works partialy: 1. &quot;captures&quot; works, the content can be sync&#x27;ed back and forth 2. but the outlines are not working, I set up the url to be something like &#x3D;http://host/org/index.org&#x3D; and it links to a foo.org, both .org files have a line in &#x3D;checksums.dat&#x3D; Every time I click &quot;sync&quot;, it seems ok but the foo.org is not fetched, the outlines panel is blank. And MobileOrg didn&#x27;t try to fetch it, as I observed with tcpdump.
 What could be wrong? How can I troubleshoot the problem? The MobileOrg version is 1.7.5
 Thanks in advance.
 P.S. I submitted an issue at https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg/issues/290, but nobody responded yet, so I re-post it here to see if someone here knows how to fix it.

                              <span>For a software team to be successful, you need excellent communication. That is why we want to build
systems that foster cross-team communication. Using a monorepo is an excellent
way to do that. A monorepo provides:
Visibility: by seeing the pull requests (PRs) of colleagues, you are easily informed
of what other teams are doing.
Uniformity: by working in one central repository, it is easier to share
the configuration of linters, formatters, etc. This makes it easy
to use the same code style and documentation standards.
Uniformity smooths the onboarding of newcomers as well as the reassignment of engineers
to different internal projects.
Easier continuous integration: new code is picked
up automatically by CI, without any manual interaction, ensuring uniformity and best practices.

 But when I try to do this I get the following persmission denied error.
 I tried some stuff. Deleting the folder C:\sr does not help. Runnig the command as administratior gives another error and I&#x27;m uncertain if that is the right way to go.
 What should I try next to get hindent installed?

                              <span>Scala CLI v1.0.0-RC1 has just been released.
 v1.0.0-RC1 is the first release candidate version of Scala CLI. Either this or a future release candidate is meant to become the new official scala runner to accompany the Scala compiler (scalac) and other scripts, replacing the old scala command.
 To learn more about Scala CLI as the new scala runner, check out a recent blogpost: https://medium.com/virtuslab/exploring-scala-cli-the-new-scala-runner-4b958245c2e0
 Notable changes:
  
better performance
 using experimental features will now produce an appropriate warning, which can be disabled with the --suppress-experimental-warning option or the suppress-warning.experimental-features global configuration key
 experimental and restricted configuration keys are now only available in the --power mode
 deprecated using directive syntax has been dropped (multiline directives and others)
 and more, refer to the release notes for details

                              <span>whenever i turn on sly to edit a lisp file or to use the repl, i would like to have something like lispy mode turned on. This would autocomplete parentheses and allow me to work comfortably with s-exps. Just turning on lispy mode causes some annoying behavior in the repl. Specifically, if im typing 
 (defun f (x).) 
 and point is at . then pressing ENTER evaluates the form, rather than inserting a new line. Maybe I set this up wrong or the lispy package doesnt interact nicely with sly?

                              <span>I use evil-mode with a few modifications.
 In normal mode:
  
s
 s is remapped to org-cycle and S (uppercase s) to org-shifttab as I don&#x27;t use the substitute key in evil-mode, and for me org-cycle is the most used command in org-mode, Tab key is just a little bit too far away from the home row. Correspondingly cycle keys in magit diff view and pdf-tool&#x27;s outline view are also remapped to s.
 
x
 x is changed to evil-visual-line for a quick single key press. Remap X (uppercase x) to evil-delete-char to retain x&#x27;s original function.
 
Leader keys
 Main leader keys are Space, f, t.
 F (uppercase f) and T (uppercase t) are rebound to keep f and t&#x27;s original evil commands.
 
e
 e is set to avy-goto-char.
 
u and U
 u is for evil-undo, U (uppercase u) is changed to evil-redo.

                              <span>I have set sentence-end-double-space to nil, and I&#x27;m trying to use non-breaking spaces after things like &quot;Mr.&quot; in &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot; so as to distinguish abbreviation dots from end of sentence dots. However, even when I include a non-breaking space (C-x 8 SPC), commands like forward-sentence and backward-sentence will still stop on those.
 My sentence-end variable is nil, so according to the sentence-end function, the value will come from the variables ‘sentence-end-base’, ‘sentence-end-double-space’, ‘sentence-end-without-period’ and ‘sentence-end-without-space’. I&#x27;ve checked all of them, and the only one that seems to be pertaining is sentence-end-base, which says:
  
Its value is &quot;[.?!…‽][]\&quot;&#x27;”’)}»›]*&quot; 
 Regexp matching the basic end of a sentence, not including following space.
  
It doesn&#x27;t say anything about distinguishing spaces from non-breaking spaces. Any clues on how to change this behavior?
 Also, can you see any unintended consequences of the setup I&#x27;m planning to use (one space after sentences, one non-breaking space after things that should not be ending sentences)?

                              <span>This is a bit of a nice-to-have, but as a programmer I sometimes wish for a way to augment code/data I&#x27;m looking at. My concrete example of yesterday was a compact hex-representation of some joystick input data. I discovered recently the highlight-functionality, and that has already been super helpful in making visibly distinct marks in long logfiles.
 I know that Emacs can do overlays (and I know that they are costly), so I wonder if anybody is aware of something like svg-annotate/git blame where for each line I get an annotation of the meaning of that line.

 Good. But how can I get a view of previous weeks, future weeks? And how is it even doing this? I don&#x27;t see any TODOs or such in the exported org-mode file. What is it, how is it populating org-agenda?

 https://preview.redd.it/juqanyg7wqra1.png?width&#x3D;283&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;947b2dbcfd219209dec6f798e4f3c3143d511d21
 The syntax here is that prod represents a DPT, [1..n] represents a set of integers from 1 to n. x.B is a type function with argument x. I am trying to calculate the number of elements of the resulting type. 
 Although I understand the concept of DPTs I don&#x27;t actually understand how they work in practise i.e. this example. My guess is that the cardinality of the resulting type is 6, (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,2) and (3,3). Can anyone give a better explanation of how this works?

                              <span>Was going to quickly write some complex computations and took a look at the source code for Data.Complex just to see what tools I get out of the box. Many of the formulas are what you would expect like:
 sin (x:+y) &#x3D; sin x * cosh y :+ cos x * sinh y 
 But the instances make no sense at all:
 instance Monad Complex where a :+ b &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; realPart (f a) :+ imagPart (f b) instance Applicative Complex where pure a &#x3D; a :+ a f :+ g  a :+ b &#x3D; f a :+ g b 
 I&#x27;m not seeing how the bind definition works at all. f is going to return a real and complex number when applied to both a and b so you are going to have to scramble. Moreover unless f is linear there is no reason to believe that f(a +ib) &#x3D; f(a) + i*f(b). It would seem to me a much more reasonable assumption would be to use numerical methods and compute a Taylor expansion for real a and then extend to b. That&#x27;s still highly questionable but at least don&#x27;t fail for functions as simple as f x &#x3D; x^2. Similarly the definition for pure makes no sense at all.
 Haskell normally doesn&#x27;t get obvious math wrong so I&#x27;m assuming the fault lies with me. What am I missing?

 -- in ModuleB import ModuleA
 fun :: arg -&gt; X a
 newtype Y a &#x3D; Y (ReaderT Bool X a) deriving (...Monad)
 funY :: arg1 -&gt; Y a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 What I would like to achieve is to replace usage of concrete type X with a (constrained) abstract type without touching code in ModuleB - shadowing ModuleA import with a Cabal mixin.
 I tried: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class ApiX m where ...
 type X a &#x3D; forall m. (ApiX m) &#x3D;&gt; m a &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It almost works - except newtype Y a above. Compilation fails with the message that X is partially applied. Note that this already exists in ModuleB and the goal is not to touch source code in this module.
 Is there any way to achieve that (using type families or whatever)?
 EDIT: The end goal is to make all functions defined in ModuleB polymorphic without touching any code in this module. In other words transform all functions from
 f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; X d
 to
 f :: ApiX m &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; m d

                              <span>I realized a while back that it should be pretty easy to write an unordered split function for the pqueue package.
 splitU :: Int -&gt; MinQueue a -&gt; (MinQueue a, MinQueue a) 
 splitU n q divides q into a priority queue of size min n (size q) and a priority queue of size max 0 (size q - n). I believe this can be achieved in amortized time O(log(min(n,|q|))) and worst case time O(log(max(n,|q|))) by operating in a manner analogous to binary subtraction. Which elements end up in which priority queue would be largely arbitrary. Would such an operation be useful for anything in practice? I haven&#x27;t been able to think of anything, but I really want to have a reason to write this ;-).
 Edit: those bounds are wrong, but the real ones are still logarithmic.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a printed book to read after finishing with Manning Publication&#x27;s Get Programming with Haskell.
 Some things to consider are that, though I can&#x27;t say for sure why, I don&#x27;t like this book. I think the issue is that it&#x27;s light. Not just verbose, but lacking in substance. Since it isn&#x27;t entirely vapid and having paid money for it, I will finish the book. It&#x27;s just anemic. And the capstone projects are fun.
 Two books which worked well for me are Manning&#x27;s The Joy of Clojure 2nd Ed. and PragProg&#x27;s Programming Clojure 3rd Ed. This is of particular significance since at least 90% of the first seven chapters of The Joy of Clojure are redundant with Programming Clojure, which I read first. I feel like I&#x27;m getting less from reading Get Programming with Haskell than I did reading content I had already covered in another book. The content just isn&#x27;t there.
 (Also, it&#x27;s worth noting that the code examples are kind of crappy. I&#x27;m finding myself refactoring this &quot;expert&#x27;s&quot; code because it&#x27;s ugly and horribly redundant. One thing I like about Haskell is that it&#x27;s beautiful, with minimal boilerplate, and code I write in Haskell looks great to me. I don&#x27;t like looking at unsightly code, and his code is mostly that. But for the sake of learning, I can look beyond that.)
 So, with this in mind, what might /r/Haskell recommend as a second Haskell book?
 Edit: I should probably mention (admit?) that I am not a programmer, and if you exclude my Numerical Analysis textbook from grad school, those two Clojure books are the only programming books I&#x27;ve read. I have been programming at some level for decades, but I don&#x27;t have a typical CompSci background. (Which may or may not be a good thing since it does also mean I don&#x27;t need to unlearn OOP.)

 I checked with the compiler and it gave me this one foo :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
 First I thought about something like this foo :: (Eq a, Eq b) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; a
 So why does it forces x and y to be of the same type? Wouldnt the second option be more general as it gives the option of x and y being from the same or different type?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I start a new job tomorrow, and I wanted to try retrieving calendar information using excorporate.
 However, the EWS url returns a 401 when an attempt is made to access it. Increasing the verbosity of the logging from request ((setq request-log-level &#x27;blather)) allows us to see that basic auth is being attempted against the https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Services.wsdl url.
 This article would indicate that Basic Auth is no longer supported: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online-september/ba-p/3609437
 I think this means that Excorporate can no longer authenticate with O365 as a result.

                              <span>I have been using LSP-Bridge and it has been a much smoother experience for me compared to both Eglot and Lsp-Mode. Though it does seem to me missing the ability to have overlays similar to lsp-UI. Anyone using LSP-Bridge know how to set this up?

                              <span>Installed on a cheap Teclast 10-inch tablet, running Android12, from F-droid.
 It appears to run in isolation, in a container, so I cannot access the file system of the tablet. Can&#x27;t see a way to copy my config over...? Any ideas? 
 It initially starts up with a tiny, tiny font size, so I managed to set up a one line .emacs to increase the font size, so it is at least readable.
 Totally unsuited for an on-screen keyboard (tried swiftkey and the hacker keyboard).
 Hacker keyboard only shows the modifiers in landscape orientation
 And lastly, how the hell do you install fonts on Android??

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a problem with byte-compiling a package that uses defhydra.
 The package defines a hydra only if the hydra package is available, but since it&#x27;s a macro, it expands during byte-compilation and some users see &quot;void-variable&quot; error when trying to use the package.
 The relevant code looks like this:
 (when (require &#x27;hydra nil :noerror) (defhydra powerthesaurus-hydra ...)) 
 The idea is not to explicitly depend on hydra (or transient), but still define such interfaces if the corresponding package is available.
 I tried using eval-after-load and with-eval-after-load, but no luck there.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate any advice or approach to try. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I was planning to use org-agenda to empty my head of the (long-term) tasks that keep bothering me to focus better on the present. However, one requirement for whatever goal/task-planner system I wanted to use came up as having a system of &quot;prerequisites&quot;. 
 For example, say I want to do a book/course on Advanced Calculus, then a prerequisite for that would be Basic Calculus. Now, I&#x27;d love the planner system to not show the Advanced Calculus until I complete all its prerequisites. But when I do complete all its prerequisites, I want it to automatically show the Advanced Calculus goal.
 Is this pre-provided by org-agenda? If not, could someone please suggest what modifications I might need to do in order to enable this?
 org-enforce-todo-dependencies seems relevant, but this seems to assume that one task&#x27;s completion may only enable at most one other task (its parent), while I can imagine that there can be one-to-many such links.

                              <span>I was inspired by code metrics that was announced a few days back that shows the complexity of a function as a overlay above the function so I wrote a simple POC that uses RipGrep to shows number of references of that function signature. SourceKit-LSP that I uses for code completions doesn&#x27;t support code lenses so I thought it would be nice to have something similar. 
 Now to my problem. When my overlay-usage-mode is enabled the scroll/trackpad is starting to behave extremely bad, it hangs and sometimes it scrolls back to the area over and over. Its the exactly the same behavior I get when using pixel-precision-mode in Emacs 29.x
 So I would like to get some help to fix my code, or at least some pointers in the right direction.
 I am using Emacs 29.x on MacOS on a M1 Pro Max so I got a lot of CPU power.

 I tried it in Vterm, term, shell, eshell, ansi-term, they displayed the same as above.
 How could get it correctly displayed as in a decent terminal such as Konsole? (Emacs 28.2 on ubuntu)

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 30, compiled from git. Pixel scroll precision mode is great, finally I can move around emacs without feeling lost with all those jumps. I&#x27;ve configured it like this:
 (setq-default scroll-conservatively 10000) (setq-default scroll-margin 5) (pixel-scroll-precision-mode t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-use-momentum t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice t) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-large-scroll-height 10.0) (setq pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-page t) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-down) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-v&quot;) &#x27;pixel-scroll-interpolate-up) 
 This lets me scroll smoothly with the mouse wheel as well. Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that I always scroll by the same amount, no matter the buffer size.
 There&#x27;s buffers that are quite tiny, like the documentation popup that corfu provides. I can place my mouse on top of it, and smooth scroll with the mouse wheel, but it scrolls too far, and it doesn&#x27;t let me see very much.
 Is there a simple way to make the scrolling dependent on the vertical height of the buffer?

 How could add ~ as elements of smartparents.

                              <span>Edit: I thought just pressing C-c a and then choosing a different view would not work, because when I did that, the main window switched from the buffer I was editing to the agenda view, so I thought I was going to lose focus of the buffer I was editing.
 But once I selected a new agenda view, the buffer I was editing regained focus.
 So the answer is, just press C-c a and then choose the new view you want.

 Original post:
 Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m in the week view of the Agenda (C-c a a) and I want to go to the view of my to-dos.
 I could press q to quit the week view, then press C-c a t.
 Is that the quickest way? I was wondering if there is a way to go &quot;back&quot; from an agenda view to the dispatcher, or to &quot;switch&quot; from one agenda view to another without quitting the agenda view entirely.
 I&#x27;m sorry if this is documented somewhere. I&#x27;ve looked in the manual and online and I&#x27;m coming up blank.

 I have been working on a library to batch requests transparently, eg: transforming multiple concurrent dynamodb GetItem requests in one BatchGetItem requests or multiple concurrent elasticesearch index request to one batched request.

                              <span>Hi I am getting confused as to how to tackle a whole book or research paper and the production of notes.  I&#x27;m doing a literature review as part of a phd, so academic level critique needed.  The referencing I can easily cite at the end of the note so that isn&#x27;t a concern. Does one research paper produce many notes, how does one title these notes please?  Is it the concept or the book etc.  thank you

                              <span>Hi,  newbie here.  I&#x27;m not overly confident or comfortable with notion, have seen hypernotes that seems easier for me, however I&#x27;ve been using Notion for a while.  I like notion as I can directly link out to a google doc.  I&#x27;ve sort of constructed the page to use notion and files embedded as if it were scrivener.  I digress.  I am writing a phd.  I do a lot of literature reviews etc.
My question here is there really much value in having a tool that presents a map of notes as per obsidian.  If I build my zettelkasten in notion which is basically a relational database is this not sufficient.  I do really want to concentrate on writing.  As notion supports my writing very well the idea of having the zettel database in the same tool is appealing to me.
Any thoughts please?
thank you Zoe</span>

 Which configuration am I missing?
 I already tried (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose-eagerly) and (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose). But it did not help.
 EDIT: Sorry for the wrong wording. I meant, cursor-at-point, not mouse-hover. Also, here is a screenshot of the help Corfu shows, and a screenshot of the type signature Eglot/Eldoc shows: https://envs.sh/hZ-.png https://envs.sh/hLD.png

                              <span>I have just spent approximately 12 hours trying to figure out why tests were breaking in my package after a significant refactor (yes, yes, I should have taken smaller steps), and it turns out the problem is that because of how emacs works and what my tests do, I had last-command set to kill-region across tests and I was generating the wrong kill-ring.
 I am slowly but surely developing some amount of knowledge I can attempt to share about &quot;how to set emacs to a good-enough-slate across automated end-to-end tests&quot;.
 If you&#x27;re curious, the package is https://github.com/trevoke/org-gtd.el - ... and the major major refactor is happening over at https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/tree/more-flexible-organization .

                              <span>Hey there,
 So I&#x27;ve honestly been guilty of always writing notes via text on my phone but never pulling them into my Emacs &#x27;ideas.org&#x27; file on my local file server that I can access via SSH and via Tramp Mode with a related Hydra.
 That being noted, here&#x27;s the workflow of what I want to achieve:
 Desired Workflow:
  
I write an &#x27;idea&#x27; note on my Android phone&#x27;s Emacs Org Mode app
 I want the heading of the actual note to be like this (with the bulletpoints via Org Mode style to be intact):
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 * Week of (Monday&#x27;s date --&gt; ex: 3-27-2023)
 ** (Title of Idea)
 *** Notes:
 (Blah blah blah my notes)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ​
 With that in mind, can anyone point me in the right direction for a good Android phone app that does some of this heavy lifting? Also, can someone help me create the right syntax for the date insertion stuff above and format of the &#x27;Title of Idea&#x27;? for org mode note ingestion?
 I&#x27;ve only done something similar for a work based todo list for ticket work, but its been a long time.
 Also, a general explanation of how I can do this process via the same Android app would be great since I have never synced notes to an actual notes file over SSH, and only did this kind of thing locally to a todo list.
 Thanks so much!

 Note: these &quot;hours&quot; are config time. I have been using Emacs to refactor some recent Python modules. I have config already to get by OK doing that.
 Hour Two
 Blown trying to figure out why Emacs was giving message &quot;Cannot open load file: No such file or directory&quot;. The problem was trying to symlink my .emacs.d folder.
 Troubleshooting why my symlinks weren&#x27;t working. Tried Powershell and CMD commands. No help. Don&#x27;t use symlinks. That&#x27;s all I discovered. Washed my hands of the problem.

                              <span>I mainly made the switch because I wanted a tool that I can rely on for years to come (but also, Org-mode). Looking back, I have switched notebooks/editors 6 times in the past ~15 years for various reasons, either because I switched OS or the old tool could no longer satisfy my needs; it&#x27;s just not sustainable and migrating contents ended up being a headache every time.
 It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, I like to think that I have found a forever home with Emacs.
 Here are some questions I have. I looked through some of the old threads but couldn&#x27;t find the answer I need. Any relevant info is appreciated.
  
What are some suggested options for syncing Org-mode files across different OS platforms, preferably E2E encrypted? One combination appears to be file sync client + Cryptomator, though unsure if that&#x27;d prove to be problematic in the long term.
 
How do people keep their configs consistent across platforms (also backing them up)? Let&#x27;s say that I carry around a Linux-powered laptop, but at home I switch between Windows and macOS for different purposes; each of them may have slightly different configs that correspond to the platform.
 
Is there a built-in cheatsheet of sort, or a toggle reference tool that can be customized, for a beginner to use as a reference while learning common keystrokes and commands? I have been killing by searching with apropos and then yanking to a separate org file; it works, just somewhat clunky. (Love the terminology, by the way.)
 
I plan to be using Emacs for academic purposes as well ­ drafting papers, processing data with scripts, so on and so forth. Any tools or advice that comes to mind?

 I have been using this package for book management, take a peek : https://github.com/lepisma/org-books
 ...and the damn thing stops working ..........and I am seeing some weird thing in the message buffer:
 Greedy org-protocol handler. Killing client.
 No server buffers remain to edit
 Deprecated date/weektree capture templates changed to ‘file+olp+datetree’.

 I am trying to capture book information by org-capture template ..wondering ..
 P.S. Pasting captured url from the clipboard to org-capture-template ...also it sometimes throws errors like this too
 ​
 * %![Error: (void-function org-books-get-details)]
 ...and running out steam while chasing it.....so ....

 Little details which might help you people :
 1) I am running emacs on tty and this stuff worked flawlessly from here. Importantly, I haven&#x27;t done any changes specific to it anywhere.
 2) Emacs version 28.1

                              <span>I guess what I mean by &quot;main&quot; is that there are a decent amount of jobs in a company that specifically hire Haskell programmers for various work. I&#x27;m aware of some niche use cases of it, like Facebook&#x27;s spam filter, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily count that as a &quot;sector.&quot;
 Are Haskell jobs reasonable to search for if you&#x27;re self-taught and no degree?
 Certain Haskell jobs are obviously eliminated since it tends to be used in very math-focused areas and academic sectors.
 I&#x27;m reasonably good at Haskell, and enjoy the language more than most, so I was curious what&#x27;s out there.

                              <span>Every cmake project seems to get built in a new folder, and it can be anywhere. In the past, I would symlink the compile_commands.json to a path that clangd would automatically find, but this is a bit cumbersome. I&#x27;m looking for something that does not require a cmake mode in emacs to find the projects.
 It seems like there are a few different ways this could be done, but I figure someone has worked through this before. There are some open tickets in lsp-mode that discuss this.

                              <span>Hi all!
 I&#x27;ve been at this Emacs stuff for a while, but only set up the Sponsors page now.
 At the moment I&#x27;m between employments, so on the odd chance the donations thing takes off (unlikely as it is), I could hold off a little longer before looking for the next job, giving that time to extra Emacs-related development.
 Please check it out, and maybe throw several bucks my way if you&#x27;re so inclined. It&#x27;s the thought that counts anyway.

download and install emacs-28.2-installer.exe from http://ftp.wayne.edu/gnu/emacs/windows/. Update path.
 M-x cd to project directory. No idea how Emacs sees working dirs. No idea how to activate a Python venv.

 Right now the basic configuration I copied from the readme works this way:

 But I&#x27;d like corfu to let me find this by typing com, M-/, space, poi. I mean, without the prefix, just like on the image above.

                              <span>I usually don&#x27;t donate to open source projects, and I only supported Magit and Wikipedia in the recent past. I&#x27;ve only been using Emacs for roughly one year, but it has been a life changing choice. I am starting to feel that it&#x27;s my editor, If I miss something I write a package for it or customize it to my will. 
 What&#x27;s your approach to support open source software, and Emacs. Is it possible to donate to the core team, the ones that works with Emacs it self?
 Have a nice weekend Emacsers.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I created a small package that some might found useful. As disclaimer: I would first point out that I&#x27;m quite new to emacs-lisp so there might be ways of doing some of this much better and much more efficient. 
 But it serves the purpose (for me at least) , I use it to create libs header and flags to my org-source blocks, using conan in the background.

 Anyway, if anyone finds it useful or have any ideas of improvement don&#x27;t hesitate to tell me.

                              <span>Refreshing packages hangs indefinitely. I&#x27;m using M-x package-refresh-contents. Pressing Ctrl-g stops the command.
 I&#x27;ve just built Emacs 29 from the Git repository (emacs-29 branch, commit b2fbec37f39, Thu Mar 30 23:55:57 2023 +0100) on Debian 11.
 I&#x27;ve tried running with emacs -q and it also hangs.
 Does anyone know how to fix this?
 My package-archive variable, when running with -q, is:
  ((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;))

                              <span>Lsp-bridge have a powerful remote code completion feature that does not rely on tramp. It comes with the following advantages: high-performance file synchronization, ssh tunnel for bidirectional communication, and server-side no need to install Emacs. More technical details are in here .

 Other highlight features of lsp-bridge compared to other Emacs lsp clients:
  
Fully asynchronous and high-performance: computationally intensive parts are all implemented in Python using asynchronous methods.
 
Out-of-the-box support for multiple LSP servers: lsp-bridge supports various LSP servers for code completion, diagnostics and fixes.
 
Seamless integration of multiple completion backends: lsp-bridge has a completion framework called ACM, which integrates lsp, TabNine, template, file path, English, Tailwind, Citre, and other completion backends. All these backends are seamless integrated.
 
 ​
 After 11 months of continuous improvement and refinement with over 84 contributors, lsp-bridge is more stable and functional than previous version.
 Welcome to try lsp-bridge.

                              <span>Is there a way with built-in project management to include multiple repositories in a single project?
 I have a project with two components each in its own git repo but I&#x27;d like to be able to jump back and forth between files with e.g. project-find-file like they were a single project.

 I have this problem where I working and by some mistake, I failed to identify when this happened, I get new frame with help. It is very annoying and actually I can&#x27;t close it because it crash mi whole emacs for some reason. Since I&#x27;m not using emacs frames at all (at least not to show multiple buffers at once, maybe some completion tolling does use it, maybe company?), is there way to prevent any opening of new frame in emacs globally? Are there any probable consequences to this?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I am trying to make a environment for developing JS, and I am having a lot of trouble installing eslint inside emacs. I can run it from the command line, but when I do M-x lsp-install-server eslint, i get the following error: LSP :: Server eslint install process failed with the following error message: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something related to my lsp config itself, because I was able to install the ts-ls server perfectly, but my lsp config is the following:
  (use-package lsp-mode :straight t :init :commands lsp :hook ( ((typescript-mode js-mode) . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map (&quot;TAB&quot; . completion-at-point))) (use-package lsp-ui :straight t :commands lsp-ui-mode) (use-package lsp-ivy :straight t :commands lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol) (use-package company-lsp :straight t :commands company-lsp) 
 Thanks in advance!
 ​
 Edit: I justo found out what was happening. Eslint comes inside a .zip file and it seems emacs was trying to use the program &quot;unzip&quot; to ... well, unzip it. I didn&#x27;t have unzip installed. So there it goes, if anyone has a similar problem, try installing unzip.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been looking at aboabo&#x27;s (author of Counsel, Ivy, Avy, Swiper, etc.) emacs config and been trying to replicate some of its functionality, specifically its autoloads. However, I seem to have some difficulty trying to get it to work. Here&#x27;s my emacs config layout:
 .emacs.d |-- auto.el |-- loaddefs.el |-- hooks.el |-- init.el |-- modes |-- java.el 
 And in auto.el, I have the following:
 (defun update-all-autoloads () &quot;IMPORTANT. Updates autoloads.&quot; (interactive) (cd user-emacs-directory) (let ((generated-autoload-file (expand-file-name &quot;loaddefs.el&quot;))) (when (not (file-exists-p generated-autoload-file)) (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect generated-autoload-file) (insert &quot;;;&quot;) (save-buffer))) (loaddefs-generate &#x27;(&quot;modes&quot; &quot;lisp&quot;))) ) 
 This is not too different from aboabo&#x27;s sli…</span>

 (defmycustomthing

 (arg2 thisOtherStuff)
 ....
 (argn lastStuff))
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 I want to write code that looks like
 (if (&#x3D; (first s-expr) &#x27;defmycustomthing)
 (for [sub-expr (rest s-expr)]
 (set-font-face (first sub-expr) &#x27;my-fun-font)))
 ​
 and that highlights arg1, arg2, .... argn
 ​
 so far all of the syntax highlighters I&#x27;ve seen rely on regexp rather than the underlying structure of the code. I want to roll my own syntax highlighter for clojure, but hopefully avoid playing regexp golf :D

 Listing the terms alphabetically is what I want 60% of the time, and the rest I want to see them by chapter, essentially &quot;narrow&quot;-ing or &quot;sparse tree&quot;-ing them by chapter. Here&#x27;s a sample of the file and the current links.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Using org-html-export-as-html seems to me that the filename is ignored. It is not rendered somewhere.
 From the users perspective where would you like to have that filename in the resulting HTML output? Here some ideas:
  
Display it in a tooltip (
).
 Render it in the upper right corner of the resulting codebox.
 Render it as a top/bottom caption.
  
Something else?

                              <span>I&#x27;m part of a team working on multiple interconnected haskell command line tools. As our tools are growing we&#x27;re slowly running into two issues: 1. Compile times are getting longer and 2. projects are getting out of sync. I hope you can give me some advice on how we should arrange things conceptually and technically to mitigate both issues. The question is not unrelated to this one here, but involves a second library.
 Here are some core infos on our setup:
  
In one repo we have a library A with two main executables Ex1 and Ex2.
 Another repo provides a library B with an executable Ex3.
 Everything is build with stack.
 Library A defines core data types and logic and is needed for Library B and all executables.
 Ex1 makes use of almost all features of A. The subcommands of Ex1 fully live …</span>

The best way to grow and learn is to step outside your comfort zone and participate. Your unique perspective and contributions are valuable and can help spark new ideas.
Although I&#x27;ve spent less time zettelkasting this week, I&#x27;ve still captured a few notes and started to build an economics structure hub.  My morning practice has shifted, and it is more free writing focused than it has been. This currently feels like progress, but time will tell. Tonight my creative energy is low, and rather than resist, I will be okay with it and rest.

                              <span>SimpleX Chat is probably the first ever Haskell app that works on Android ARMv7a 32 bit CPUs. Huge thanks to u/angerman who made it possible. Now that Haskell GHC compiler support ARMv7a, I hope there will be other apps, not only on Android, that benefit from it!
 New in v4.6:
  
support for Android 8+ and ARMv7a devices!
 hidden profiles – you can hide your private chat profiles with a password.
 group / community moderation.
 improved audio/video calls - fully re-implemented in iOS to use native iOS interface for calls and improved on Android.
 reduced battery usage, particularly when sending the messages to large groups.
  
Also, since v4.5 release we added Dutch, Czech, Chinese and Spanish interface languages, thanks to the users&#x27; community and Weblate!
 See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 v4.6.1-beta.0 is also already available on GitHub and in our F-Droid repo - it includes experimental support for sending files up to 1gb via XFTP (it can be enabled via Developer tools) and many fixes.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?
 SimpleX Chat security was assessed by Trail of Bits in November 2022.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve asked myself how much of linear logic can be done in linear Haskell. I&#x27;m pretty sure that pure Linear Haskell isn&#x27;t enough. Let&#x27;s define:
 type Not a &#x3D; a %1 -&gt; () 
 This is the type of &quot;obligations for an a&quot; or &quot;slots for an a&quot;. I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s a way to implement Not (Not a) %1 -&gt; a, which is a requirement for linear logic. But looking through the linear-base library I found the following function:
 alloc :: Int -&gt; (DArray a %1 -&gt; ()) %1 -&gt; Vector a 
 In other words: &quot;Give me a way to fill an array with n elements and I&#x27;ll give you an array with n elements&quot;. This means that alloc 1 is already what we want!!! linear-base (maybe accidentally?) implies all of linear logic. Of course it&#x27;s a bit cheaty, alloc uses unsafeDupablePerformIO internally, but if the linear-base authors have decided that it&#x27;s fine I&#x27;m okay with it.
 I wrote up some basics of linear logic in Haskell (over here). Using double negation you can implement both of the missing monoidal operations (&amp; and ⅋/Par, the other two already exist: ⊗&#x3D;(,) ⊕&#x3D;Either) and interpreting Ur as ! also gives you ?. I&#x27;ve also done some laws including (iso-)mix and both exponential isomorphisms.
 I think it&#x27;s a bit surprising that it&#x27;s actually doable. I would have expected that it&#x27;s either already done or deliberately impossible. But I haven&#x27;t found anyone talking about doing it, the closest is this library by Edward Kmett which uses some magic to embed linear logic inside of linear Haskell. Unlike this approach I don&#x27;t think it gives you linear logic for all of LinHask, but only for some types.

                              <span>I would like to set the default evil state of term-mode to normal (for reasons outside the scope but related to evil leader keys), and I use ansi-term.
 When I have the line
 (evil-set-initial-state &#x27;term-mode &#x27;normal) 
 in my init.el, emacs freaks out on startup (but no errors) and what I get is emacs inside of emacs, which is entirely unusable. I suspect this is because term-mode is actually invoked during setup or something, but I could equally just be making a mistake.
 If this won&#x27;t work, what is the best way to achieve this behavior (ansi-term starting in the normal state for evil)? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I’ve been using Vim for 20 years. Tried Emacs once, but it was so long ago I can’t even remember my impression.
 I’d like to try DOOM for 6-8 weeks to get a taste, but I couldn’t care less about org mode or magit or integrated browsers. I just want to go about my usual Python workflow: Copilot, pyright, testing, pre-config, grepping, linting, file switching, … the usual suspects. 
 I tried VSCode and walked away because the polish didn’t seem to be there for a lot of the plug-ins. On the Vim side, we’ve got all the tpope stuff that has been around for years and is mature and nuanced.
 I judge an editor by how it performs on things I do 100s of times a day. What should I look for in Emacs?

Some hints by minad suggest it should be possible (e.g. https://github.com/minad/vertico/issues/321#issuecomment-1399902077 and https://github.com/minad/vertico/issues/320#issuecomment-1399261079), but I can&#x27;t seem to make them work. I tried those, and also with local-set-key, but no bliss.
 For the sake of concreteness, here is one actual case I&#x27;m trying to have one such binding: I&#x27;d like to bind &#x27; in the minibuffer for find-file and related commands which takes me to consult-find at the current location. So I have: 
 (defun gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer () &quot;Search file with find, enter the result in the minibuffer.&quot; (interactive) (let ((dir (file-name-directory (minibuffer-contents))) (file (file-name-nondirectory (minibuffer-contents)))) (gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (funcall-interactively &#x27;consult-find dir file)))) ;; http://oremacs.com/2015/07/16/callback-quit/ ;; But this version comes from Ivy. (defmacro gb/minibuffer-quit-and-run (&amp;rest body) &quot;Quit the minibuffer and run BODY afterwards.&quot; (declare (indent 0)) &#x60;(progn (put &#x27;quit &#x27;error-message &quot;&quot;) (run-at-time nil nil (lambda () (put &#x27;quit &#x27;error-message &quot;Quit&quot;) (with-demoted-errors &quot;Error: %S&quot; ,@body))) (abort-recursive-edit))) 
 I currently bind this with:
 (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd &quot;&#x27;&quot;) &#x60;(menu-item &quot;&quot; gb/consult-find-for-minibuffer :filter ,(lambda (cmd) (when (memq current-minibuffer-command &#x27;(find-file find-file-other-window find-file-other-frame project-find-file)) cmd)))) 
 But I find this procedure somewhat clumsy, and would prefer to use vertico-multiform for that.
 So, is there a general procedure to use vertico-multiform to make a keybinding on the minibuffer-local-map for specific commands?

I have found the variable &#x27;eglot-ignored-server-capabilities&#x27; but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using it correctly because no matter what I do, the flymake diagnostic keeps appearing. Does anyone know the solution?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to use &#x27;tmux&#x27; in &#x27;vterm&#x27; to manage some terminals, but the tricky part I have found is to grab buffer text from split terminals that are split horizontally (aka one top terminal and one bottom terminal) for log trackback stuff.
 That being said, does anyone know any good Emacs packages could open up a buffer to quickly switch between available &#x27;vterm&#x27; instances on the fly? This alone would be super helpful to me since I usually have to run at least two separate &#x27;vterm&#x27; terminals for web dev stuff for Ruby On Rails and React (aka on terminal for &#x27;npm start&#x27;, and one terminal for &#x27;rails s&#x27; for local development).
 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I am still in the process of befriending calc. One of the things I have a hard time liking is that when I enter a multiplication like &quot;a * b&quot; what calc shows on the stack becomes &quot;a b&quot;. I could care less how it looks on the stack but I do care that this is also how it looks when I yank it into an org mode buffer. I tried it with and without no-simplification and also with latex Mode but it doesn&#x27;t do anything different. Ideally I would like it to display &quot;*&quot; when in normal mode and \cdot when in latex mode.
 I am on Emacs 28.2 and also tried this with emacs -q.
 Is this intended behavior? Is there an option or a way for me to get my wishes granted?

                              <span>Issue: https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat/issues/35
 Some users asked for Windows support in Eat, so I&#x27;m considering it. I don&#x27;t use Windows, so I need help from someone who is familiar with Windows.
 After searching the internet, I found that Alacritty supports Windows. I discovered that the TERM in the Alacritty terminal on Windows is xterm-256color, instead of alacritty or alacritty-direct. I also discovered that there&#x27;s also a dumb TERM environment variable in Windows, but no TERMINFO environment.
 Now, my questions are:
  
Does Windows have any mechanism to inform the program about the terminal&#x27;s capabilities (like terminfo in Unix-like systems), or is it fixed to the XTerm escape sequences?
 
Why M-x eat and M-x term says Spawning child process: Invalid argument on Windows?
 
Does set-process-window-size work in Windows?
 
Is it possible to support Windows only using Emacs Lisp (without any C code)?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am excited to announce my new Emacs package, ancilla.el, which is my first attempt at writing a bigger Elisp project than just customizing my own stuff. The motivation behind this package was the recent discontinuation of OpenAI&#x27;s Codex API, which caused another Emacs package, codex-completion, to stop working. I wanted to improve the AI-coding interaction and came up with some new ideas that I implemented in ancilla.el.
 I must admit that parts of the code were actually written with the help of ChatGPT and GPT-4, which was a really weird and fun experience.
 Thank you for your attention and I hope you give ancilla.el a try!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with emacs-jupyter for a few days now. when i output a pandas dataframe with a lot of columns (around 24), the resulting org table is horizontally too long. how do you suggest i handle/navigate these kind of tables?
 i normally use visal-line-mode and olivetti-mode, but had to turn them off to get a better view of the table.
  
I&#x27;ve thought of binding some keys to jump to the next/prev column.
 I&#x27;ve looked at https://github.com/misohena/phscroll, but was wondering if there are other approaches
 as i was writing this post, i noticed org-end-of-line provides nice horizontal navigation (it kind of goes to the end of the visible line, not the literal end). however, org-beginning-of-line goes straight to the beginning of the line

                              <span>Had a curious psychological reaction to using Emacs for pretty much everything on a minimal linux desktop over about six months. I think it was to to with the plain text and almost complete lack of graphical interest. I just started feeling really flat emotionally. Like the screen I was looking at was utterly uninteresting.
 So I went back to windows for a while, using VS Code, a graphical git client and so on and strangely there I felt the opposite, like the graphical density with so much on the screen was almost overwhelming after months without all that graphical clutter. That faded over a week or two and I found myself adding a few non-Emacs apps with more graphical elements alongside Emacs to mix things up.
 This was quite strange, I learned to program using VT terminals and actually worked in places where my daily computer was a vax system with a VT terminal and never felt anything like this.
 I&#x27;m not intending this as a slight against Emacs, but I found it was interesting that my brain just started to shut down a little due to the lack of stimulating stuff on the screen. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I know some of you guys pretty much live in Emacs 24/7, do you find it overwhelming to use a very graphical application after that? Or people who do the opposite and work in a graphically intensive environment a lot, do you find it relaxing, or boring, or have any other reaction to switching to Emacs (or any other plain text environment) afterwards?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs as my java ide for class at the moment, and while it&#x27;s mostly fine, using javafx is a bit of a bother because emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize any of the javafx libraries. I can write working code just fine, it&#x27;s just the syntax checking will highlight everything that isn&#x27;t from the standard library and clutters my screen with fake errors. Is there a fix for this?

                              <span>Ahoy, Emacs aficionados! 🎩
 I come to you with a tale of woe, for I have been both blessed and cursed by the Emacs wizardry. As my fingers dance across the keyboard, conjuring powerful Emacs incantations with ease, I find myself unable to enjoy the mundane GUIs and simple apps that litter the software landscape. 🧹🖱️
 You see, dear friends, Emacs has spoiled me with its boundless customization, incredible extensibility, and mind-bending keybindings. Now, I dread the moments when I must use the pedestrian applications my company forces upon me. Oh, how I long for the sweet embrace of Emacs in those dark hours! 💔🕰️
 In my despair, I turn to you, my fellow Emacs magicians, for camaraderie and counsel:
  
How do you cope when the world demands you to use lesser tools? 🛠️😢
 Are there secret spells to imbue these uninspired apps with even a fraction of Emacs&#x27; power? 🔮✨
 Can we petition the powers that be to make Emacs the one true editor, unifying the world in a harmonious symphony of keystrokes? 🌍🎼
  
I eagerly await your wisdom and insights. In the meantime, I&#x27;ll be huddled in the corner, clutching my Emacs manual like a treasured tome, dreaming of the day when all software is as magically magnificent as our beloved editor. 📖💭
 Yours in Emacs enchantment, 🧙‍♂️

 First up I use a basic bash script to launch a new emacs session, without my config getting in the way:
 ./build.sh:
 #!/bin/bash start_web_server() { emacs -Q --script org2web.el &amp; EMACS_PID&#x3D;$! echo &quot;Web server started with PID: $EMACS_PID&quot; } stop_web_server() { echo &quot;Stopping web server with PID: $EMACS_PID&quot; kill $EMACS_PID } trap stop_web_server INT start_web_server wait 
 which, in turn, calls:
 ./org2web.el:

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;ve been trying to create a function that can be called to load a CSV into a string array, but I&#x27;m having trouble returning it outside the array once it&#x27;s captured. Here&#x27;s the code I have so far:
 object CSVImport extends App: println(&quot;Running CSVImport&quot;) def run(path: String) /* : Array[String] */ &#x3D; val bufferedSource &#x3D; io.Source.fromResource(path) //val outputArr &#x3D; new Array[String](5) for line &lt;- bufferedSource.getLines.drop(1) do val outputArr &#x3D; line.split(&quot;,&quot;).map(_.trim) bufferedSource.close //outputArr 
 I&#x27;m attempting to call it in Main:
 @main def Main() &#x3D; val arrayOutput &#x3D; CSVImport.run(csvPath) 
 I&#x27;ve tried to make the Object Def output to an Array[String], however I&#x27;ve been struggling with making the output work. When I execute the code as-is with the extra bits commented out, I get a nice Scala array which I can call individual columns using println(s&quot;${flightData(1)}&quot;), but when I uncomment the extra code the output becomes a mess, I think due to the Array format being from java. I get the output [Ljava.lang.String;@35f983a6.
 My question is, is it possible to export the outputArr without converting it to a java format, so I can keep the legibility and pass it through to other functions? and if not, how can I format the gibberish output into something usable?

Algebraic Path Finding by Iago Leal de Freitas
There’s something magical about polymorphic algorithms. Really, isn’t it awesome to write a piece of code once and then just tweak the meaning of some inputs to solve another seemly unrelated problem?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
I have a very quick (and embarrassing) question about keyboard shortcut function in The Archive. I work in split screen mode all the time (PDF left and The Archive right) and need to fold the Sidebar constantly to have more space so the writing doesn&#x27;t look crammed. However, using the mouse to fold the Sidebar away is slow and cumbersome, and the keyboard shortcut is written as ^+command+S.  What key does ^ imply me to press? I cannot get the shortcut to work, which is very annoying and embarrassing at the same time.
Please help!</span>

 (global-set-key &quot;\C-w&quot; &#x27;backward-kill-word)
 For some reason sometimes when I type this combination my Emacs freezes. If I hit C-g something quits and the backward-kill-word command finishes. I can&#x27;t figure out exactly when it happens because sometimes it just works fine. 
 What is a good approach to debug this? How can I find out what the something is that is freezing my Emacs?

The only information I can find says to install the package, but it’s not showing up in my package list. Is there something I’m missing? Or some way to install manually? I had it running fine on my old intel air, but can’t remember how I did it.

 1) Can you see breakpoints in terminal mode with realgud:gdb and gdb ? 
 2) Can you evaluate variables in terminal mode ? 
 For me breakpoints are not visibles
 To evaluate with gdb it is answered file is &quot;read only&quot;
 To evaluate with realgud-gdb is there another way that ask in gdb prompt ? 
 How do you do for 1) and 2) ? or you always prefer another tool that emacs ?

 I am using mac os and I have looked online to fixing this dvipng problem but none of those solutions were not able to fix the above issue on my macbook. I am also wondering if this is because my org-roam directory is on onedrive. It seems when I double click the file from the directory in my mac it opens up that file in emacs without error. But when I do C-c n f it gives me the error.

                              <span>I have seen there are quite a few options, hoping someone can suggest one which works well as a coding assistant.
 Think along the lines of asking questions about the selected region, like what does this error mean can you convert this to a different format for me, can you generate some code todo this.
 Been using it to convert sql to honeysql and it can do a pretty good job saving me converting it currently doing it in browser but would like some closer integration.

 THE GOAL:
 launch an emacs web server, in a new session, to serve the files contained within the &quot;public&quot; directory, which is located in same directory my script is called.
 THE APPROACH:
 use a basic shell script (./launch.sh) to run an emacs-lisp build script (./build.el) that uses org-publish to publish my org files to HTML files in the (.public/) directory, mentioned earlier, then serve them in a web server written in emacs-lisp.. amazing.
 THE CODE:
 ./launch.sh
  #!/bin/bash emacs -Q --script build.el &amp; 
 ./build.…</span>

 I tried something like what is below...
 #+name: cor:1 #+begin_corollary This is my corollary. #+end_corollary [[cor:1]] 
 But in the pdf, it shows up as ??. I am not really sure what is going on. TOCs for my documents are no longer appearing as well, so it could be that they are related. Any help is appreciated.

 The recentf command gives me listings like this, hiding the useful bit (the actual filename) behind the too-long path listing:
 ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/highweirdness/essays/ecstas... -rw------ 17k (etc)
 Ugh! What I want is to see:
 Dropbox/highweirdness/essays/fullfilename.mdown (etc)
 In God&#x27;s name, how do I customize recentf output to collapse e.g. ~/Library/CloudStorage/ ?
 Thanks in advance.

I also heard about leaf, which is a (package configurator/loader) alternative to use-package? According to the elpaca documentation, one is supposed to use use-package like this:
 ;; Install use-package support (elpaca elpaca-use-package ;; Enable :elpaca use-package keyword. (elpaca-use-package-mode) ;; Assume :elpaca t unless otherwise specified. (setq elpaca-use-package-by-default t)) ;; Block until current queue processed. (elpaca-wait) ;; Expands to: (elpaca evil (use-package evil :demand t)) (use-package evil :demand t)

 I use the following code to set &#x27;lsp-java-format-settings-url to override the default format config.

 Any input is appreciated.

 For example consider the Haskell package: GlossI would like to import a function called to display in the Gloss package.

 This program is independent of Google Summer of Code, but it offers the same opportunities, including mentorship and a stipend, to would-be Haskell contributors.
 You don&#x27;t have to be a student to participate - your eagerness and desire to learn are enough!
 Project proposals are due by April 20, 2023.
 Details, including application instructions and a list of suggested projects and volunteer mentors, can be found at: https://summer.haskell.org
 If your company or organization wants to support new contributors to open source, please write us an email at summerhaskell.org. Funding a stipend or two can have a large positive impact on the Haskell ecosystem!

 I have this given datatype for a QuadTree (trees whose internal nodes have 4 children)
 data QT a &#x3D; C a | Q (QT a) (QT a) (QT a) (QT a) 
 Which is used to represent 2^n x 2^n matrices. 
 For example the matrix:

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was wondering a while ago how Haskell &quot;decides&quot; if a given recursive type definition should be given by the least or greatest fixed point. In particular, for a given type equation there are two canonical solutions given by the least and greatest fixed point respectively. But certain types &quot;feel&quot; more like one than the other. For example, lists or Peano numerals &quot;feel&quot; like least fixed points, whereas streams &quot;feel&quot; like greatest fixed points (and in fact the LFP solution is just the empty type, ignoring bottom). So then how does Haskell decide which form to take if the user never specifies?
 So this got me thinking: are Haskell recursive datatypes always given by greatest fixed points? This does seem to make sense mathematically, as for example gfp X. (1 + X) would give the naturals plus a point at infinity, and this translates in Haskell to
 data Nat &#x3D; Z | S Nat zero &#x3D; Z one &#x3D; S Z two &#x3D; S (S Z) ... inf &#x3D; S inf 
 (i.e. we can implement a term representing an infinite stack of successors)
 So is this actually the case? Does Haskell justify recursive datatypes by greatest fixed points? Or maybe does it not really care about any mathematical justification (i.e. you just get what you get by making a tagged union and putting pointers to the right types)?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I wrote very basic introductory series on Cats Effect 3 especially for newbies to effect system. Here is the link https://yadukrishnan.live/series/cats-effect
 Please do let me know if this is helpful for anyone.
 This was not intended for people already familiar with the CE, Monix, ZIO etc, but for people who are trying to get started with CE-3.

                              <span>I have a capture of &quot;file+datetree&quot; that I update daily but the file is getting too large and it is slow to open and parse. I was thinking about breaking this existing file up into many pieces by date into it&#x27;s own subdirectory and naming the files by date. Maybe having a file by day, though I could possibly get away with the files still being small enough by having a file per-month versus per-day.
 As such I need new captures to go to a new file (automatically naming file like YYYY-MM-DD__suffix.org) if it is a new day and then continue to put additional captures to that new file throughout that day. Then it would begin the cycle again for the next day.
 I believe this is beyond the existing functionality of org-capture from my research so maybe there is package out there that works like this or maybe I just have to figure out how to code an e-lisp solution if not?

 Scenario:
 I change the state of a todo item from TODO to WAITING FOR EXPORT. When that happens I want to automatically create a new todo item in my todos.org file, that has the title RUN EXPORT with a scheduled date for tomorrow. 
 This fits my workflow perfectly and is a function that I&#x27;ve always wanted from other todo list apps :)

 #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output print(2) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS:

 (setq python-python-command &quot;/usr/local/bin/python3&quot;) (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;/usr/local/bin/python3&quot;) (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((emacs-lisp . t) (shell . t) (python . t))) (use-package python-mode :ensure nil :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;/usr/local/bin/python3&quot;)) 
 But running the code block by having the cursor inside the block and pressing C-c C-c I get the error/message from the *Org-Babel Error Output* buffer saying:
  
/bin/bash: python: command not found
  
With no output being produced not matter the code I use. I assume my config is still poorly setup since the error is referencing /bin/bash for some reason?

 Installing emacs-nox (using yum) on Centos-7 (on an old AMD PC), It is also installing trousers package (tss). Question is why?
 Thanks!

Would people please test the latest prebuilts at: 
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/ 
 and verify that they indeed work correctly on all of these newer

There is also now an emacs-30 folder on GNU alpha. Only one build (&quot;master&quot; at revision 28a9438169f) is posted, so far, plus initial dependencies and dependency source archives.

                              <span>What I am about to say is best reproduced with an empty configuration. So if you want to reproduce this issue just back up your ~/.emacs.d and any other init files to a different folder and try this.
  
First I run M-x customize.
 In the search box I search font-lock-comment-face. The default color is shown as Firebrick and the default state is STANDARD.
 Change the color to green.
 Then Apply and Save. The state becomes SAVED and set.
 Check ~/.emacs. It has this code inserted: &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground &quot;green&quot;))))
 Now Revert &gt; Erase Customizations. The face is now -- Empty face --. The state becomes EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save it. (This is where I have trouble. Why is the state not STANDARD again? Why is the face not Firebrick again?)
 Then Apply and Save. 
 Check ~/.emacs. It has &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face ((t nil))).
 The comments are now black in my code.
  
Why does &quot;Erase customizations&quot; remove the default value? Why does it not revert the customization to standard state as mentioned in Emacs documentation?

 I&#x27;m a bit able to read and write Japanese and know how inputsystems like IMEI work. I never used Japanese as input or output in Emacs. So I&#x27;m not sure why it is relevant for Emacs.

                              <span>So I was just going through my older journal entries and found the following entry: 
  
I do not think that AI is the right choice for a lot of our things if the underlying problem of freeing humans always remains. It makes more sense to me to be a part of a group where the focus is on freeing our time through removal of shackling of our time than to build AIs that feed the capitalist to extract more wealth from underpaying humans and from keeping them subjugated to 8 hour work days no matter how advanced the AI is. Eventually, the AI is going to be a prime worker for the capitalist than for the betterment of humanity. 
 I refuse to be a part of this process and that is why I am choosing not to get into those domains in any which way. 
 Emacs therefore remains my stronghold that I would like to curate and build my freedom from. If one cannot free themselves from 8 hour senselessness, then they can build stuff to free up time and work from home and do other more productive and happiness, mental peace bringing things. Productive here means that doing what I really want to do and doing it rather than producing as much value for the capitalist who would rather discard me if there was a more productive person or an AI.
  
This reminded me about one of the prime reasons why I wanted to use Emacs - it&#x27;s extensibility that enabled me to build shortcuts and workflows that help me with shaving off sufficient amount of time which I spent on repetitive tasks. The trick however is to not to be vocal about your efficiency to your bosses because the time saved will be used against you to staff you with more work whether you want it or not. 
 Go use the time saved to spend with your loved ones, yourself, exercise, learn something, do nothing or even just calm and rest. It&#x27;s your reclaimed time. 
 Who else does this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if chatgpt these days is powered by GPT-4 or not, but it&#x27;s showing improvements in some areas compared to where it was a few months ago. Nowadays, if I ask it &quot;Why do sharks eat elephant eggs&quot; it doesn&#x27;t tell me that sharks rarely get a chance to do so cause elephant eggs are so large and on land, but rather that elephants do not lay eggs.
 Today I decided to test it by asking how one would use Scala 3 macros to get the types of the inputs and outputs of a method. It had some decent suggestions to do that for someone that is new to macros, but a lot of its answer was false, suggesting people use something called QuotesContext, not recognizing properly what extension methods are available for the Symbol type, and worst of all, trying to splice Type values into an Expr.
 If they can manage to get chatgpt to actually tell the truth consistently (like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do that&quot; rather than just lying) I think it will be a nice resource for discovering how to do stuff you don&#x27;t currently know how to do. Sadly, it&#x27;s still got a nasty habit of making stuff up.

                              <span>Is it possible to treat headings with TODO keywords fundamentally different in the LaTeX export? I&#x27;d like to not treat them as headings, in a normal document structure, but rather render them as insertion, interupting the document structure, but i still want to render normal headings as normal headings, which are part of the document structure.
 I&#x27;d prefer to do this using pandoc, but if there is an easy alternative, I&#x27;d happily take it.

                              <span>I often find myself realizing I want to convert a heading tree structure to a plain list, with checkboxes. And I find I have to do that by hand. The closest I have found in the docs to doing what I want is org-toggle-item, but at least the standard behavior doesn&#x27;t preserve the depth of the heading that you convert, and it also doesn&#x27;t work on a whole subtree, but instead just over a single item. 
 Why isn&#x27;t this a common enough use-case to be built-in functionality? How is this not something that everyone else wants all the time too?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use Haskell as a hobbyist (Go at work) and have been learning it for some time now. After going through books like Get Programming with Haskell and Haskell in Depth and making some projects I want to delve deeper into the more advanced stuff available with the language an become proficient with it (usage of DataKinds, GADTs, HKTs and so on, even linear types).
 However, I&#x27;m finding it difficult to come with use cases for these features and examples where these features can be the most appropriate answer. I struggle to wrap my head around the concepts as they are exposed in Haskell in Depth for example. Of course I don&#x27;t blame the book, but I feel there wasn&#x27;t enough room in it for me to get the clear picture (as obviously there were many more things to cover in around 600 pages)…</span>

                              <span>I was introduced to Haskell by a friend a few years ago (he has a PhD in Automatic Theorem Proving). I tried learning, but got bogged down by the mathematical intricacies.
 Fast forward a few years and I went to a couple sessions about category theory by Bartosz Milewski (in person), but it still seemed way over my head.
 I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for ~6 years now, and have always been interested in the concept of formal verification, &quot;proof-based&quot; correctness, etc, and Haskell always seems to come up. How do I learn Haskell properly this time? The &quot;Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!&quot; didn&#x27;t quite resonate with me, so open to suggestions!

 Progress so far: * CentOS 7 yum install ghc provides 7.6, but ghc 9.0.2 requires ghc 8.8 to build (which requires 8.4, which requires 8.0, which requires 7.8, which can be built with 7.6) * Wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to cross compile for this platform using this doc: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/cross-compiling * Ubuntu bionic does provide ghc 8.0 with the same glibc version, which does work when copied into CentOS 7 * Building ghc 8.4 on CentOS 7 is now giving me &quot;C99-compatible compiler needed&quot;

                              <span>This question may be asked may times. Please give an other chance. I started playing around with Haskell for few weeks now. Slowly I am getting more interested towards it. I am programming for more than a decade. Much of my programming is around C#, Java &amp; JavaScript(Currently). I am exploring functional programming for few months now, just out of curiosity. Now am thinking to move my career towards new paradigm and projects.
 1. How big is job market for Haskell and which are the major industries? ( of course location is important, am currently based out of India), But generally.
  
Where Haskell stands against other functional programming languages like Scala, F# &amp; Clojure, in terms of usage in industry and which are those? 
 
Optimal learning path and projects to start with!
 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Is there any source for haskell best practices? Or haskell tips/useful design patterns ? Although i have grasped the basics like monad transformers, existential types, type families, etc i feel as if i still need more experience and knowledge.
 for instance when should i use state? and when doing so what are the considerations when choosing between IOrefs, MVars , STM or the state monad?
 Besides the libraries in the CLC which are the &quot;default&quot; libraries for a certain topic? For instance for xml there are 3 libraries, i have many questions in this style/topic and feel that many others may as well have them.

I understand this is not the latest Haskell compiler - I intentionally want to match versions and work through specific examples, that are over a decade old. My goal is to work through the exercises as Bruce, the author, intended. 
 Are there any pre-built VMs, or community resources for easy-installations for older versions? I tried asdf and the version of Haskell was just too old to get the right pieces together for compilation.

Overview: Khoj now exposes a chat interface to your second brain. Uses GPT models by OpenAI.
 Background: I&#x27;d posted about Khoj a few months ago. Since then khoj.el has become available on MELPA, gotten a Chat interface and can automatically set up the backend python package. Thought I&#x27;d provide an update for folks to try it out.
 Chat Features 
 Faster answers: Find answers faster, with less effort than search. No need to manually scan through your notes to find answer
 Iterative discovery: Iteratively explore and (re-)discover your notes using multi-turn conversations
 Creative assistance: Smoothly weave answers retrieval with content generation
 
  
Quickstart:
  
M-x package-install khoj
 M-x eval-expression RET (setq khoj-openai-api-key &quot;YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;)
 M-x khoj RET c via transient
  
See readme for proper setup instructions
 Warning: Your query and notes in search results are sent to OpenAI for ChatGPT to respond.

                              <span>Sometimes I copy or move a file from one directory (&#x60;com/example/foo&#x60;) to another (&#x60;com/example/bar&#x60;). I then end up with a file that should be in the package com.exmaple.bar with the statement package com.example.foo. Is there an lsp-java command to fix the package statement, assuming that the directory is correct? 
 I can write something that searches for the package statement and checks it against the directory, but if the code already exists, I&#x27;d rather just use it. And it&#x27;s probably been checked against some corner cases that I&#x27;m initially going to miss (like if there is no package statement at all).

                              <span>So far I&#x27;ve been using tree-sitter.el with the tree-sitter-hl-mode for syntax highlighting. As far as I understand, Tree Sitter is now built-into Emacs 29 and above as treesit (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/admin/notes/tree-sitter/starter-guide), which makes tree-sitter.el obsolete. There is also this package https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto which seems to handle the installation, mapping and activation of the language modes.
 But what I don&#x27;t understand is, how do I activate syntax hightlighing with treesit, without having tree-sitter-hl-mode? Is this done automatically once the major mode for a given language supports Tree Sitter? With the help of treesit-auto?

                              <span>Hi I have created the below script with the intention of allowing me to have certain tasks recur on set days. I am sick of having multiple Task &#x27;A&#x27;s because they need to be executed on Monday, Wednesday, Saturday. However I am having an issue with the final step. When I select the task and hit Enter, it automatically marks it as done but then provides me with a prompt to select the next day to re-occur. 
 Is there a better way to do this?

 What is this for? It is off by default. Do I need it?
 I like to run emacs as a daemon. But why is systemd useful for that?

                              <span>I have a couple of large hydras, e.g., for smartparens, and I occasionally forget a key, but I vaguely remember the name, and skimming through a list is slower than completions.
 Sacha Chua has solved this: https://sachachua.com/blog/2021/04/emacs-hydra-allow-completion-when-i-can-t-remember-the-command-name/
 Except, the binding to tab in the hydra-base-map doesn&#x27;t work, I can&#x27;t figure out why. The my/hydra-execute-extended function works great though, if you invoke it after quitting hydra.
 Any ideas how to fix the binding?
 P.S. Huge thanks to Sacha, I learned a lot about emacs through her blog.

 But how can I investigate such crashes?
 I&#x27;m using Emacs29 as daemon in (SSH) terminal. There is not error or debug output. It just disappears.
 What can I do to improve the output?

                              <span>I do use Emacs 27 (Debian 11) on a RaspeberryPi 4 via SSH shell. I do OrgRoam and Python. The lsp-server (eglot) is disabled most of the time because of performance problems.
 It is working but slow in some situations.
 Are there improvements between 27 and 29 that could possible improve the performance of Emacs use?

                              <span>Is there a preferred way to set up multi language/dictionary spell checking on windows?
 Reading up, it seemed ispell using Hunspell is what is mostly used, but also seems on windows you have to use a very old Hunspell version (1.3.x?) or have issues with it not finding dictionaries.
 Just trying to find a way to do spellchecking in English and my native language in Emacs without spending days setting up workarounds to make things work.

                              <span>My use case is that I don&#x27;t want to switch to terminal just for some simple commands (commands that I just need to execute then and leave) like docker-compose -f /very/long/path/to/my/docker-compose.yml up -d, I think I can just make use of the  compile function like:
  compile  docker-compose -f /very/long/path/to/my/docker-compose.yml up -d 
 and it actually works. However I still have many other simple commands, for now I can navigate up/down one-by-one to find the exactly command, but it would be more productive to have the list of history suggestions (just like fzf command history) when I press &quot; compile &quot;
 How can I do that in emacs?
 p/s: I use vertico.

                              <span>The problem with missing &quot;org-assert-version&quot; is known and described a lot. Also the workaround. But I don&#x27;t get it.
 I&#x27;m using Emacs 27 from Debian 11 repo. I removed the whole ~/.emacs.d/elpa folder just to be sure that org is &quot;deinstalled&quot;.
 The I created this el file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;))
 (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;org) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And loaded it via emacs -Q -l x.el. But I got the message that org is already installed.
 I don&#x27;t know how to go along.
 Some background info: That Emacs 27 was working very well the last year. But I tried Emacs29, build it myself. But then I removed it (via sudo make uninstall and make distclean). Something must happens since then.

                              <span>I released the first version of the Jinx spell checker on GNU ELPA. Jinx aims to be efficient and unobtrusive, such that you can enable it always. Jinx provides the jinx-correct command to correct the nearest misspelling via completion or all misspellings in the whole buffer if invoked with a prefix argument.
 For performance reasons Jinx directly binds to the libenchant native library and lazily checks only the visible portion of the current buffer. Libenchant provides backends like Hunspell and Nuspell which also power the spell checking in word processors or browsers.
 I am interested in your feedback. The package is still young, so expect some rough edges. See the following links for more details.

                              <span>I know this must be in docs somewhere, but I haven&#x27;t been able to make it cooperate and it&#x27;s been driving me to cocoa puffs. 
 What causes org-roam to jump to the capture even when &#x60;:jump-to-capture nil&#x60; is set on the template it uses? https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1292 (seems to be an issue others have run into)
 ​
 Looking through the code it appears a &#x60;:finalize&#x60; template keyword is used to potentially run either &#x60;org-roam-capture--finalize-find-file&#x60; or &#x60;org-roam-capture--finalize-insert-link&#x60; (it seems to be running the former now) 
 Everything I change in the template seems to be irrelevant. 
 At this point I&#x27;m thinking of just removing the entire org-roam-capture--finalize hook from org-capture-after-finalize-hook. And just resyncing the db separately?

                              <span>Hello, I recently started learning how to use Nix Os and I am running it on a LXC container in a Proxmox host. I was wondering whether anyone has a recommened way to set up a remote graphical emacsclient through x2go. I am willing to share my configuration details and other information necessary to get it working. I read through the post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8t461y/how_to_run_a_graphical_emacsclient_on_a_remote/ which covers the main steps, however, once I run the x2go client, It runs into a blank white screen. If I change the session type to XFCE I am able to see a desktop but I can&#x27;t interact with anything on the screen.

 (mu is an email search engine, and mu4e is the emacs e-mail client on top of that)
 Grab it here: https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/v1.10.0; For all details, see https://github.com/djcb/mu/blob/release/1.10/NEWS.org (and I&#x27;d recommend reading that before installing), but some highlights are:
 For mu4e:
  
mu4e now keeps track of _updates_ in your mail, compared to some baseline; in the bookmarks list you see e.g. 1(+1)/2 for a bookmark, which means that there was one new message since &#x27;baseline&#x27;. See the manual for details https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Bookmarks-and-Maildirs.html
 this also feeds in to the much improved mode-line support which shows the same information, also outside mu4e, so you see when there&#x27;s new mail; and in the not…</span>

 I’d played with emacs before then, but I stuck with vim because I liked it’s keybindings more.
 I’m not trying to cause a war here, but do you think that users trying to replicate vim are missing out on anything?

But all the links connecting my notes seem to be broken in org (which makes sense I guess, anyway whenever I click a link I get a messaage with &quot;No match - create this as a new heading? y or n&quot;). Is there a way to convert the md-files to org and at the same time keep the links and connections in my vault intact (I have a lot of notes so editing the links would take a looong time)?

                              <span>I am trying to switch to eshell from vterm+zsh and I find some of the user experience frustrating. For example, while pcomplete opens a new window for completion it does not switch to it automatically and it does not escape the spaces. This means that every time I have to add quotes myself or escape the spaces manually. I would also like pcomplete to be like orderless and vertico and allow me to select entries the same way.
 I am now using corfu with eshell and it is a bit less frustrating but it is still not smooth as much as zsh completion system is. For example, I have to press escape otherwise I cannot stop the corfu autocompletions once it is activated.
 So my questions are:
 ​
  
Is there a way to make pcomplete escape spaces and special characters when completing in eshell? Ideally I should not have to switch to the pcomplete window but it should be done automatically.
 Is there a way to use vertico and orderless, rather than pcomplete, or even in tandem with pcomplete? I would like my eshell experience to be as close to the rest of the Emacs.
 Is there any other suggestion or improvement that makes you life in eshell easier?
  
​
 Thank you very much.

                              <span>Hi,
 Just updated to the newest Emacs 29, with straight.el:  (use-package expand-region :straight (expand-region.el :type git :host github :repo &quot;magnars/expand-region.el&quot;) :bind ((&quot;M-e&quot; . er/expand-region)) ) 
 While this package used to work correctly on an early December 2022 snapshot of Emacs 29, currently it no longer seems to work correctly. As soon as I invoke the command er/expand-region, the entire document is selected instead of (sub)sections of an org document, or paragraphs in a text document.
 Did anyone encounter this issue?
 Bad
 PS: I encountered some other issues with this Emacs 29 version that could be fixed by just re-loading the top elisp file of a package (e.g., yasnippet), but this would not work here.

                              <span>Today I had to painfully go through each commit in a series of 10 that I was interested in re-wording. I marked a region on the Git history I was looking at and tried unsuccessfully to re-word all of them (each at the time), it is the commit under the pointer or nothing.
 The same happens when I want to remove commits. And I also don&#x27;t understand how to cherry-pick commits from one branch to another (I did learned about &quot;donate&quot; commits using Magit, which does what I want with a region of commits)
 How am I supposed to use these features from Magit? What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m an experienced technical writer (25+ years) working in software development. I am trying to write a novel. Several months ago I was excited to discover Obsidian and then, by way of Obsidian, even more excited to learn about Zettelkasten. But I&#x27;m having trouble finding my way past productivity paralysis / analysis paralysis (whatever term you choose).
There are clearly SO many ways to do this, and it&#x27;s overwhelming.
I&#x27;ve been browsing this forum and seeing lots of posts saying that one has to find their own way of conducting their PKM and their Zettelkasten. However, I&#x27;d like to avoid investing a lot of time customizing a productivity system that I may not end up using -- I&#x27;ve done this in the past with other systems and find myself spending more time figuring out a system than I do actually using it.
I would love to have a list of simple steps -- here&#x27;s exactly what you do, one, two, three -- that enables me to jump in and start using a Zettelkasten. And I would love to see some actual examples of what people have done. I&#x27;ve seen some of that in this forum, but I&#x27;m also a bit overwhelmed even by the forum.
Has anyone else struggled with this, and if so what you have found?</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
I discovered Zettlekasten about 3 years ago when I read Sonke Ahrens How to Take Smart Notes and have struggled with it ever since.  I started out with manual notes - that didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m just too all over the place.
Then I tried Roam and honestly that didn&#x27;t work well either.  I had trouble finding notes bi-directional linking notwithstanding.
Somewhere I stumbled upon Workflowey.  I&#x27;ve been using Workflowey combined with a manual card index, supplemented with another manual index in a journal for close to a year now.  It works very well for me.  From the moment I opened Workflowey I stopped using Roam - it was an incredibly smooth transition.  Not only can you back up to Dropbox, exports are easy as is printing.  I LOVE Workflowey.
All of that said I&#x27;m so happy to find an active community around Zettlekasten - I still struggle with mine and am always looking for how other people are implementing.
As to what I use it for - I&#x27;m afraid nothing as high minded as some of the other users here.  I am not a researcher - I am a small business owner and a wannabe writer with a couple of blogs.  I started my Zettlekasten to improve my reading retention and of course to help me find and connect notes and highlights from my reading.
Looking forward to exploring this site and meeting people on this forum.  Thanks:)</span>

                              <span>A &quot;morgue file&quot; is a collection of notes, articles, and files kept by investigators or journalists for possible future use. Today, I have developed a morgue file that in my zettelkasten that collects items that I think might provide fodder for my fiction writing.
I write speculative fiction and so I track newspaper articles or reports that I think might serve as the germ of a story. Then, as part of my writing process, I&#x27;ll make a new (structure) note and include links to articles or pieces that might inspire pieces of my story (whether character, setting, or plot).
For example, I recently learned about Point Nemo, a &quot;spacecraft cemetery&quot; in the Pacific Ocean that is a &quot;pole of inaccessibility,&quot; the location farthest from any land. This was intriguing enough, so I did some more cursory reading and learned (among other things) that it is also a remarkably lifeless part of the ocean because it is so far from land. Also, in spite of not being officially identified as the &quot;pole of inaccessibility&quot; until 1992, Point Nemo is near where H.P. Lovecraft placed R&#x27;lyeh, the lost city where Cthulhu is imprisoned!
At any rate, I now have a cluster of notes about Point Nemo that is forming the gensis of a story about scavengers trying to salvage material in this remote location. The real-life details are helping me flesh out the skeleton of a plot and raising more questions for me to explore. (For example, I know next to nothing about what might be involved in this salvage operation, so I now have some more reading to do!)
I thought I&#x27;d share in case others are interested in using their zettelkasten to generate ideas for fiction, and to learn from others who might implement a similar practice. Do you have any other tips or advice? Pitfalls to avoid?</span>

Is there a way to convert the md-files to org and at the same time keep the links and connections in my vault intact (I have a lot of notes so editing the links would take a looong time)?

                              <span>When I use debug to debug a function, the resulting buffer is often so tall that I can’t see the buffer that is being acted upon. I have to keep dragging the window down so I can see movements of point, cut text, etc. 
 Is there a way to set the debug buffer&#x27;s max height?

                              <span>Hi there,
 today I updated to the latest HEAD of the Emacs 29 branch. It looks like it broke several packages.
 First: yasnippet. When enabled via yas-global-mode it regularly causes errors like this:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments # 2) vertico-exit(undo 0.5) yas--post-command-handler() 
 The second one is highlight-indent-guides. When enabled it throws errors like this:
 Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 1501) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3001) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 2488) signaled (wrong-number-of-arguments # 0) Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 3988) signaled (void-function nil) 
 I can&#x27;t get a backtrace via toggle-debug-on-error, sorry :(
 It also looks like I can avoid these errors by disabling nativecomp: when setting this in early-init.el:
 (setq native-comp-jit-compilation-deny-list &#x27;(&quot;.*&quot;) native-comp-speed -1) 
 all errors are gone.
 Is this my fault?
 Best regards, CK

                              <span>I made a small package to add some actions to evil-mode using the new built-in tree sitter library. The package only works with Emacs 29 or greater. To activate, just run M-x evil-ts-mode. This was so easy to do, that it hardly merits a package. But perhaps it will be useful to someone. I use it mostly with python, but I&#x27;m guessing it should work OK with other languages.

 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C&#x3D;M;O&#x3D;D 
 Notes:
 - I changed the file-naming convention with this version. Binary sets are now named to include the git revision short code instead of the date of build.
 - My build script seems to work gooder than ever b4 so I&#x27;ll probably start making these snapshots pretty aggressively, as I see commits to the Emacs 29 branch, during the final push to release of Emacs 29.1

                              <span>I&#x27;m having an issue with getting dired to show a folder on a remote server that is running zsh and MacOS. I have the fix in for my .zshrc file that has this line so that at least the login works:
 [[ $TERM &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;dumb&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; unsetopt zle &amp;&amp; PS1&#x3D;&#x27;$ &#x27; &amp;&amp; return
 ​
 When remoting in, it will list files at the home directory, but when I try to switch into any folder remotely, I don&#x27;t see a directory listing.
 When looking at the Messages buffer, I do see this message: 
 Invalid face reference: dired-directory-face [72 times]. 
 Is it possible this is related, and is there a workaround?

                              <span>I am trying all of this in GUI Emacs (not terminal). I have defined the following key-binding:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-1&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;Hello&quot;))) 
 But if I press C-S-1 I get this error:
 C-! is undefined 
 I know that this works:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-!&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;Hey&quot;))) 
 Now on pressing C-! I do get the message &quot;Hey&quot;.
 But I want to know why my first key binding C-S-1 does not work?
 Note: I am not trying to solve any specific problem. So I am not looking for suggestions on how to &quot;solve&quot; the problem. There is nothing to solve. I am only trying to understand why C-S-1 does not work. Hopefully understanding this will teach me a thing or two about how Emacs key bindings.

  (setq global-auto-revert-mode 1) (setq auto-revert-use-notify nil) ;; e.g. for dired buffers (setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t) 
 After starting emacs I checked the value of that variables and they are as expected.
 But auto-revert doesn&#x27;t work even in a simple txt file. I open a txt file. Then I also open it with another editor (geany), edit and save it. Nothing happens in emacs. When I try to edit that file in emacs I&#x27;m informed about that this file was modified. But this is to late. I want to make the revert automatic without asking me first.
 Then I disable(!) the global revert mode and enabled it again. Then it works. Modifications I do with Geany are loaded in the emacs buffer automatically.
 First I thought something interfered with my python/eglot/xyz setup. But as I say it also happens with a txt file.

                              <span>So let&#x27;s say I have a main where I try to process input arguments, perhaps open a chosen file with specific extension only, read something from the file in an expected format, etc. And I have proc_args, check_extension, proc_file_data, functions. Each of those functions can fail, eg if necessary argument is missing, file with wrong extension has been provided, the file doesn&#x27;t follow the expected format. Based on what I know about haskell, using Maybe type as the return value of the functions seems reasonable to me, Nothing if it fails, Just result if it succeeds. What I&#x27;m having trouble with is how to actually utilize this in main. I do something like this
 let proc_args_result &#x3D; proc_args args if proc_args_result &#x3D;&#x3D; Nothing then die &quot;Invalid arguments&quot; else return() ... -- continue working with processed arguments 
 the problem is that if I want to continue working with the processed arguments, I still have the Maybe value instead of the actual value of the result. Alternative is using
 case proc_args args of { Nothing -&gt; die ... Just value -&gt; ... -- continue here } 
 but that will lead to uncontrollable indentation

                              <span>data Example &#x3D; forall r. Example { field :: r -&gt; Int } fieldL :: Lens Example Example (r1 -&gt; Int) (r2 -&gt; Int) fieldL &#x3D; lens getter setter where getter (Example {field}) &#x3D; field setter _ f &#x3D; Example { field &#x3D; f } 
 The error is
 Diagnostics: 1. • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘p’ with actual type ‘r -&gt; Int’ ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by the inferred type of getter :: Example -&gt; p • In the expression: field In an equation for ‘getter’: getter (Example {field}) &#x3D; field In an equation for ‘fieldL’: fieldL &#x3D; lens getter setter where getter (Example {field}) &#x3D; field setter _ f &#x3D; Example {field &#x3D; f} • Relevant bindings include field :: r -&gt; Int getter :: Example -&gt; p 
 Why can I not create a lens for an existential data type? How can I make lenses for existential data types?
 Update: The real code is
 data RowHdr n e &#x3D; forall r. RowHdr { draw :: ListFocused -&gt; WidthDeficit -&gt; RowHdrCtxt -&gt; r -&gt; Widget n , width :: AvailWidth -&gt; [r] -&gt; RowHdrWidth , toRH :: e -&gt; Index -&gt; r } 
 I just want a lens into this data type.

do have a ubiquitous capturing device: notebook and pen
do review weekly: a shitty week more often than not turns out to be 2 shitty days dominating your memories
full text search alone doesn&#x27;t help find things that exist with a slightly different wording than you&#x27;d expect
I leave breadcrumbs in my ZK when I have a miserable time finding something to strengthen it retrievability


do log events that cause negative emotions, but don&#x27;t log the emotion; no need to feel miserable again</span>
