                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make my emacs bindings consistent across packages so at the moment I want some way to make compile-goto-error open the error in the current window instead of splitting the view and showing it in a side window. But I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a convenient option or editor feature I can exploit. Does anyone have any tips?

                    <span>For example, C-x C-; (comment-line) works perfectly fine when using emacs insdie xterm/uxterm, but not inside any other terminal I have tried (gnome-terminal, rxvt, kitty etc). In all of the others, emacs seems to think that I&#x27;m pressing C-x ; instead.
 Do you guys understand why this happens? This tends to annoy me a bit on the rare occasion that I have to use emacs inside a terminal since many of the shortcuts I am habituated to aren&#x27;t available.
 My guess is that xterm sends extra escape codes that other terminals that emacs is able to detect and support, but I would love to know if someone knows for sure. Also, do you know of other terminals that have these extra xterm capabilities (perhaps hidden under some settings)?

                    <span>I use vim and I like it a lot, but I have heard about evil mode and it seems it&#x27;d be like having vim inside emacs, which I do find neat since it would let me get the benefit of both
 But many times I&#x27;ve heard stories about pinky finger and carpal tunnel damage in the long run, and this is something I&#x27;d like to avoid if I can help it
 Is it possible (and worth it) to use emacs without whatever it is that seems to ruin people&#x27;s wrists with time as they use it?
 (And as a bonus, for anyone out there who has used both vim and emacs, is there anything that I would miss coming from vim if I use emacs with evil mode?)

 So, from today on there is another moderator on the r/emacs team, namely /u/Zaeph. I hope you all will give them a warm welcome.
 I had to unpin the weekly questions thread when making this an announcement post, btw, you can find that thread here: https://reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/p6mwx2/weekly_tips_tricks_c_thread/

 As stated in the title; X410 works with, for example, xfce4, but not EXWM. I use Arch, btw.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hi, im learning emacs and trying to adopt it as my file manager. so im trying dired.
 I would like to have a single key or keybind to :
 Open images in another frame without losing focus (Like C-o)
 Play music files (.mp3 .wav) in a simple way, I am not looking for a complex player nor a way to organize my music, i just want to play the mp3 file to look what it is.
 Open .mp4 files with vlc, pdf&#x27;s with evince, .ggb with geogebra, .xfc with gimp, etc.
 Is there a way to achieve this? Like a master Key/keybind to open all things

                    <span>This is my entire config, except for stuff to set up the package library and install use-package (full config here).
 (defun test-func () (interactive) (message &quot;my func&quot;)) (use-package evil :init (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t) :config (evil-mode)) (use-package general :config (general-override-mode 1) (general-evil-setup t)) (use-package evil-collection :after evil :config (evil-collection-init) (setq evil-collection-setup-minibuffer t)) ;;1 (use-package counsel) ;;2 (use-package dired :ensure nil :general (:states &#x27;normal :keymaps &#x27;dired-mode-map &quot;j&quot; &#x27;test-func)) 
 As-is, when I open dired (C-x d), hitting &quot;j&quot; will call test-func. However, if I switch blocks 1 and 2 so that dired comes first and counsel comes second, &quot;j&quot; will instead call evil-next-line. Why does this happen?
 Edit: After not being able to reproduce this with other packages, I looked in counsel&#x27;s code and found that it does a require for dired. Replacing (use-package counsel) with (require &#x27;dired) also worked - but why? Shouldn&#x27;t my use of use-package and general already load dired and define keybindings? Why do my bindings get overwritten if I don&#x27;t require dired before its use-package block?

                    <span>I have a small question best illustrated by this self-documented org-mode snippet:
 - I&#x27;ve started a list in org-mode. I pressed RET to make a newline within the current item. - I pressed M-RET to create a new item. Now I&#x27;m done with the list. What do I do to exit the list and go on writing something else? (C-o C-n would work but be damned if there isn&#x27;t a single combo for this ...) 
 Couldn&#x27;t find the answer in the docs.
 Edit: The described behavior of RET - creating a new indented line when list item is at point - was added recently. I&#x27;m currently experiencing it in org-mode 9.4.6 - and I was just surprised that there&#x27;s no intuitive way to make a newline that&#x27;s neither indented nor a new list item.

                    <span>I just upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1 (using GUIX) and now all the dailies functions are missing.
 I found 
  
(define-obsolete-function-alias 
 &#x27;org-roam-dailies-find-today 
 &#x27;org-roam-dailies-goto-today &quot;org-roam 2.0&quot;)
  
But I can&#x27;t find any mention of dailies being removed in the release notes. Dailies are still in the manual as well. They were working fine in version 2.0. 
 Why were they removed? 
 This was part of my daily workflow. Any suggestions for how to get capture to at least roughly replicate the way dailies worked?

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m just getting into Org-mode and am having trouble dealing with links. In Markdown you can do the following:

 This is [Reddit].
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is there a way to do this in Org-mode? I&#x27;ve had a look around but I can&#x27;t seem to find anyone with the same problem.
 The second table in this part of the Wikipedia article seems to suggest that this isn&#x27;t possible.

                    <span>Obviously in most cases it is necessary or desirable to call up embark-act before you execute an Embark command. However, there are some commands I want to use so frequently (e.g., pulling up Help documentation for a command I’m considering using under M-x) that I want to have a dedicated keybinding to execute the Embark action on the selected target without having to pull up the Embark menu first. So in my example, I would hit a keybinding that immediately brings up the Help doc for the selected M-x candidate while still keeping the minibuffer open (instead of having to first press embark-act-noquit and then h to send describe-symbol).
 Maybe this is a question specifically for u/oantolin, but I’m not entirely sure how to go about programming this after reading through the Embark wiki. Is it possible to do in a simple manner?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a hobby programmer doing only very simple work in Ruby, where literally everything is an object. You might be able to imagine that I struggle a bit with wrapping my mind around Haskell. I&#x27;d appreciate it if someone could tell me how the following would be approached in idiomatic Haskell.
 I want to check data for a bunch of conditions, collect the met conditions in a list, and once everything is done, I want them to be output to the console one by one. In Ruby I do it like this, pound sign is comments:
 # Here&#x27;d be a bunch of variables, mostly true/false toggles for storing states relevant to multiple conditions, and a map (i.e. a key-value list) which serves as storage for input data met_conditions &#x3D; [] if [some condition] met_conditions &lt;&lt; &quot;name of the condition&quot; # Append string to list end # This repeats two dozen time with pretty complex if-trees met_conditions.each {|i| puts i} # Print each item individually with newline 
 Cheers for sending me on the right path.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a Haskell novice.
 In another language, I might often use an enum to represent some class of objects (let&#x27;s say types of fruit for sake of argument), then work with arrays of that enum type. I&#x27;m writing a depth-first search for a single-player puzzle game and I&#x27;d like to encode the types of squares on a board in this way, but I&#x27;d also like to use unboxed arrays for the performance. Is it possible (with reasonable simplicity) to add an instance of UArray for a simple sum type like data Fruit &#x3D; Apple | Orange | ..., or am I stuck working with an undesirable layer of translation from a primitive type to my abstracted representation?

                    <span>I&#x27;m at a point where I don&#x27;t know how to proceed in my career.
 I&#x27;m currently a senior software engineer using .NET, so OOP is my specialty. I&#x27;ve read about and implemented SOLID, Design Patterns, some DDD in my applications; mostly working in implementing Web APIs.
 This is what I pride myself with, the back-end. As I&#x27;m technically a full stack dev with Angular but I&#x27;m not that much into the front-end past writing services/components.
 After discovering cryptocurrencies, in particular Cardano, and seeing what amount of brainpower goes into developing such a ecosystem I&#x27;ve deep-dived into Haskell.
 I&#x27;ve read &quot;Haskell Programming from first principles&quot;, and I found it brilliant. I&#x27;ve also skimmed through the other beginner books, i.e. &quot;Programming in Haskell&quot;, &quot;Real World Haskell&quot; etc.

                    <span>Looking for advice on some Hakyll customization.
 I have a Hakyll site that includes .lhs files. I&#x27;m trying to insert links from my pandoc-compiled lhs pages to the raw lhs. The natural way to do that is to have a context field that gives the URL to the raw version.
 To accomplish that, I thought it would be good to define a new type of field. I was aiming for something like urlField. Here&#x27;s what I ended up with, which is working:
 -- | Create a field that is the URL to the given version of the current item -- or non-existent (suitable for use in @$if(...)$@) if there is no such -- version. versionedUrlField :: String -- ^ version -&gt; String -- ^ key -&gt; Context a versionedUrlField version key &#x3D; field key $ \i -&gt; let empty&#x27; &#x3D; fail $ &quot;Cannot find routed \&quot;&quot; ++ version ++ &quot;\&quot; version for item &quot; ++ show (itemIdentifier i) lhsFilePathCompiler &#x3D; (getUnderlying &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (load . setVersion (Just version) :: Identifier -&gt; Compiler (Item String)) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; getRoute . itemIdentifier) in maybe empty&#x27; toUrl  lhsFilePathCompiler 
 The strange part of this is the explicit type given to load . setVersion (Just version). I&#x27;d like this code to work regardless of how the resource I&#x27;m loading was compiled, but ghci does not seem to be able to give me the appropriate type make this polymorphic, and I&#x27;m not sure what it is, either, if it&#x27;s even feasible.
 Alternatively, I&#x27;m very open to &quot;here&#x27;s a much better way to accomplish the same than your versionedUrlField function&quot; :)
 (If anyone wants to use this as is, feel free. However, if you&#x27;re using a copyFileCompiler or the like for your versioned file, you will either want to change the explicit type above or replace just copyFileCompiler with copyFileCompiler &gt;&gt;&#x3D; getResourceString, both of which feel gross.)
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m trying to make a custom collection and I need a Map, and I&#x27;d like to use a specific type of Map according to the generic type of my custom collection.
 For example, I&#x27;d like to do something like this (it&#x27;s not valid Scala 3 code):
 import scala.collection class CustomCollection[K, V] { type UnderlyingMap[K, V]  immutable.LongMap[V] case AnyRefK  immutable.AnyRefMap[AnyRefK, V] case _ &#x3D;&gt; immutable.Map[K, V] } ... } val a &#x3D; CustomCollection[Long, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.LongMap[String] val b &#x3D; CustomCollection[String, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.AnyRefMap[String, String] val c &#x3D; CustomCollection[Char, String] // UnderlyingMap is a immutable.Map[Char, String] 
 Is that even possible? How could you do it in Scala 3?

 I am planning to use scala refined types to validate JSON configuration files. I was wondering if anyone is using them, and how has been there experience. More specifically, I am concerned about if it adds lots of boiler plate as we are in a much mature stage of application. I tried value classes and new types macros but nothing seems to be as robust/ efficient as refined types for my current work. 
 Thanks

                    <span>I have a large 20K line Scala project, and I was super lucky, just changing the Scala version to 3.0.1 compiled in the first try. Did not have to use any migration scripts.
 I have two questions: 1. Is this kind of simple migration dangerous by potentially changing the meaning of the code? 2. Is there a tool that would beautify code according to the new features - for example, removing the &quot;new&quot; keyword, etc... Or at the very least, is there a list of trivial migrations that everyone should do after Scala 3 migration?

                    <span>Can sb explain to me why this won&#x27;t compile (2.13);
 case class Wrapper[A](a: A, fun: A &#x3D;&gt; String) Seq( Wrapper(&quot;String&quot;, (x: String) &#x3D;&gt; x), Wrapper(1, (x: Int) &#x3D;&gt; x.toString) ).foreach{ w &#x3D;&gt; println(w.fun(w.a)) } 
 But this will;
 trait Wrapper2[A] { type myA &#x3D; A val a: myA def fun(a: myA): String } val s &#x3D; new Wrapper2[String]{ val a &#x3D; &quot;String&quot; def fun(a: myA): String &#x3D; a } val i &#x3D; new Wrapper2[Int]{ val a &#x3D; 1 def fun(a: myA): String &#x3D; a.toString } Seq(s,i).foreach{ w &#x3D;&gt; println(w.fun(w.a)) } 
 In the first case, the A-s are the same and we know that. In the second case, we just know that with extra steps. In both cases the Seq will be a Seq[Wrapper[_&gt;:String with Int]] 
 I wanted to encapsulate the instances with its typeclasses, but this seems super boilerplaty. 
 Also, I totally understand why this won&#x27;t work (but still we should know that we can call the fun with a no matter what &quot;object&quot; is a, the compiler guarded us at the callsite);
 object Wrapper2 { def apply[A](a: A, f: A &#x3D;&gt; String): Wrapper2[A] &#x3D; new Wrapper2[A]{ val a &#x3D; a def fun(a: A): String &#x3D; f } }

                    <span>I am trying to do this leetcode question - https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/ - in scala but my solution is just too slow. It seems just as fast as the imperative solutions so does anyone know why it is performing so poorly and how to speed it up? Ideally, I want to have a purely functional solution using continuations. 
 def partition(L : List[Int], V : Vector[Int], i : Int, sc : Unit &#x3D;&gt; Boolean, fc : Unit &#x3D;&gt; Boolean) : Boolean &#x3D; { L match { case Nil &#x3D;&gt; if (V.forall(_ &#x3D;&#x3D; 0)) sc() else fc() case x::xs &#x3D;&gt; val fail &#x3D; {unit : Unit &#x3D;&gt; partition(L, V, i + 1, sc, fc)} if (i &#x3D;&#x3D; V.length) fc() else if(V(i) - x  true} val fc &#x3D; {unit : Unit &#x3D;&gt; false} partition(nums.toList, Vector.fill(k)(target / k), 0, sc, fc) }

                    <span>Daily ICFP
Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 1 - Monday
These notes follow Noon, Arnaud, and Richard through their day at ICFP,
roughly in order.
Richard — Calculating Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional
Pearl)
Started my day at 6:30am in order to attend the Q&amp;A for Calculating
Dependently-Typed Compilers (Functional Pearl), by Mitchell Pickard and
Graham Hutton, of the University of Nottingham. (I watched the video itself
last night.) This is a very cool paper about a technique for deriving a
proved-correct compiler by construction. The main example in the talk was
about compiling a simple expression language to a stack machine. The
correctn…</span>

                    <span>Hello,
 I like using bitmap fonts, they&#x27;re significantly clearer to me, but they&#x27;re generally pretty small. The typing latency in emacs is already pretty poor, but with small fonts it becomes almost unbearable, comparable to working over SSH.
 Originally I thought it was syntax highlighting &amp; other plugins, but if i open emacs in the terminal it runs great... which implies it&#x27;s the font rendering???
 How is the font rendering implemented? Is it possible to write my own, and connect it to emacs running as a server? I have no idea wtf the gui is doing to make it so slow:/

                    <span>I noticed org-agenda has been lagging when I initially invoke org-agenda (or, alternatively, (org-agenda-list &quot;a&quot;)). When I check my buffer list I can see that before the invocation nothing (other than the scratch, et al files) is listed. Post-invocation, I can see every file which is enumerated in my &#x27;(org-agenda-files (list org-dir))).
 Based on the documentation, it states a &quot;view will be created for every file listed in org-agend-files list&quot;. Is a buffer synonymous with a view?
 How might I speed up the agenda invocation? It currently takes 10-15 seconds with, maybe, ~100 files.

                    <span>Hey r/emacs!
 How do I turn off the font-lock mode at point? This is for org-mode files. Basically, I want the italics, links, strong or other decorations to text appear plain text, so they are easily editable, whenever I put cursor on them.
 Is there a good way to do it? Or, is there are better/other way to achieve editing these entities quickly and universally?
 Thanks in advance!
 Update: Thanks to u/gusbrs for pointing out https://github.com/awth13/org-appear
 This works:
  (use-package org-appear :custom (org-appear-autolinks t) (org-appear-submarkers t) :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode))

                    <span>Is there an option to keep all of compile data on ram to avoid using SSD? I read that disk is used for dependencies, so isn’t that just the first compile with recompilation not being ssd dependent? I don’t expect I’ll be building binaries. I’m deciding between buying more ram and SSD.

 I know that this might be a dumb question, as the existence of such a function would be problematic in many applications, however, in my case it might prove to be very useful.
 Is there a function in Haskell such that:
  getDefinition :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; String getDefinition &#x3D; return the program text (or something similar) of the input function 
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi, im learning emacs and org, im not confident yet with variables and stuff, but following guides and reading documentation helped me a lot. however i can&#x27;t find the way to hide the GridTimes wich already have a task, for example:
 main: 7:30-10:30 TASK 1
 8:00...... ----------------
 10:00...... ----------------
 main: 10:30-12:30 TASK 2
 12:00...... ----------------
 14:00...... ----------------
 I want to hide the &quot;8:00 ; 10:00 and 12:30&quot; marks, since these times are filled with TASK1 and TASK2 respectively. How can i achieve this? Also i do would like to view the tasks in &quot;time blocks&quot; if possible. (like google calendar for example)
 Sorry, im not english native and this was pretty difficult to explain. Thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;m just getting started with encrypting my org files and have a use case that I can&#x27;t figure out. I want to archive subheadings from time to time but I want those to remain encrypted.
 How to encrypt gpg_archive files?
 If I have foo.gpg and archive a subheading, it automatically creates foo.gpg_archive. It does not automatically added the # -*- mode:org; epa-file-encrypt-to: (&quot;me@me.com&quot;) -*- header, so I add that. But then I close and reopen foo.gpg_archive and I do not get prompted for a passphrase, as I do with foo.gpg. What do I need to do to encrypt foo.gpg_archive?
 Alternatively, how to exclude :ARCHIVE: tags from being searched?
 I would prefer a solution to the above problem, but if that&#x27;s not possible (I&#x27;m fairly certain it is) I&#x27;d be ok with a solution to excluding headings with an :ARCHIVE: tag from search (I use swiper and evil mode search so preferably both, if they aren&#x27;t the same thing under the hood).

                    <span>I noticed org-agenda has been lagging when I initially invoke org-agenda (or, alternatively, (org-agenda-list &quot;a&quot;)). When I check my buffer list I can see that before the invocation nothing (other than the scratch, et al files) is listed. Post-invocation, I can see every file which is enumerated in my &#x27;(org-agenda-files (list org-dir))).
 Based on the documentation, it states a &quot;view will be created for every file listed in org-agend-files list&quot;. Is a buffer synonymous with a view?
 How might I speed up the agenda invocation? It currently takes 10-15 seconds with, maybe, ~100 files.

                    <span>Dear #Scala, I&#x27;ve created GitHub Action that sets up everything you need for Scala, Scala.js, sbt in a single action: https://github.com/japgolly/setup-everything-scala
 Let me know any other improvements and features missing. I think it&#x27;d be really cool to have a centralised and simple, single action.
 (Actually, it&#x27;d be awesome to put this under the official Scala umbrella like scala/setup-everything-scala and just have an org with a few members to maintain it over time, with me (@japgolly) just being a democratic maintainer.)
 Any FYI &amp; enjoy!

                    <span>Hi peps
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying again to read the famous scala with cats book, and I&#x27;m confused about a point in the introduction. The book talks about
 ​
  
typeclasses - in scala, traits with at least a type argument, such as JsonWriter[A]
 typeclasses instances - concrete, implicit implementations of the above for specific types, e.g. JsonWriter[String]
 Usage of typeclasses - methods that use typeclasses instances as implicit parameters
 Difference between Interface Objects (e.g. Json.toJson(&quot;my string&quot;)) and extension syntax (&quot;my string&quot;.toJson)
  
That much is pretty clear and the examples on point.
 It also says that you don&#x27;t have to define instances for every possible type, but instead those can be constructed by known instances. For example, if you have an instance for A, B and C, and you…</span>

                    <span>My team has expressed considerable discomfort with the use of implicits in Scala and wants to do away with them entirely. I think this is a brute force approach to a very solvable problem because I once found implicits intimidating but I am comfortable with them now.
 What are some ways, courses, training materials, exercises that can help boost comfort of using implicits in Scala?
 Are there alternatives to writing Scala free of implicits? how tenable is it?

                    <span>I know there are ZIO Task, Monix Task, Scala Future, and so on. But putting those things aside, if I want to model task with pattern like [1]. Are there any similar ways of handling this (or pattern) using FP? 
 I understand FP is quite different thought, but I am learning by mapping between concrete examples and FP concepts. Any recommended docs or books that I should read? I read a some info e.g. Applicative[2]. That seems to me a good way to model tasks. But I am not sure about other parts such as task progress, and so on. I could totally go to the wrong direction; therefore I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks

                    <span>Daily ICFP
Several Tweagers all agreed to gather notes here about our
ICFP (International Conference on Functional
Programming) experiences. We plan to publish these notes every evening.
Day 0 - Sunday
These notes follow Noon and Richards ICFP day, roughly in order.
Noon
This is my first day ever at ICFP! I’m just trying to get the hang of
the platform, the topics, what background knowledge I’m expected to have, and
how things are presented.
Noon — Higher-order Programming with Effects and Handlers by Jonathan Immanuel Brachthäuser
First talk I was able to make it to (I slept in…)
Was still waking up when I started watching it, so missed a few of the motivations and key concepts.
Based on Effekt (not Effekt).
Seemed to hinge on function as “second-class” citizens, but I didn’t quite captur…</span>

Reading. I love learning new things. However, it wasn&#x27;t enjoyable until I met the Zettelkasten Method, so I had always procrastinated on it. Thanks @sfast and @ctietze for all the effort you put into the blog and this forum! In specific, reading to me boils down to: 1) Read…</span>

                    <span>TLDR: What&#x27;s the easiest way of tracking the value of an org statistics cookie through a git commit tree?
 Background
 I use org-mode and git to track my reading habits. I have a document tree with a heading for each book, and three possible todo states: TBR, Read and DNF. The document is thus structured as follows:
 * Books [X/Y] ** TBR Title 1 ** Read Title 2 ** DNF Title 3 
 The value of X is the count of how many titles below it are marked Read, while the value of Y is the count of how many values are marked either Read or TBR. DNFs don&#x27;t enter into the statistics at all.
 With this document, I sometimes add new books to be read, and when I&#x27;ve read a book, I switch the todo status from TBR to Read. If I try the book and don&#x27;t want to finish for one reason or another, I mark it DNF.
 The document is version controlled, so I can go back and see how the list has changed with time. I thought it might be fun to try and plot how the size of the list of books has changed with time, but I don&#x27;t know how to automatically extract the statistics cookie for each commit.
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>I did this code that allows me to download an elfeed entry as audio or video, but as I am a beginner in elisp I&#x27;d like to see some ideas and advices on how to improve it:
 ; Download entry as a 1080p video in directory defined i.e &quot;~/vids&quot; (defun dl-video () (interactive) (let ((default-directory &quot;/media/offline&quot;)) (async-shell-command (format &quot;youtube-dl --format &#x27;best[height&lt;&#x3D;1080]&#x27; &#x27;%s&#x27;&quot; link)))) ; Download entry as audio in directory defined i.e &quot;~/mux&quot; (defun dl-music () (interactive) (let ((default-directory &quot;~/mux&quot;)) (async-shell-command (format &quot;youtube-dl -x -f bestaudio &#x27;%s&#x27;&quot; link)))) ; Prompt to select the format of the download (defun option () (interactive) (let* ((choices &#x27;((&quot;Video 1080p&quot; . dl-video) (&quot;Music&quot; . dl-music))) (choice (completing-read &quot;Download as: &quot; choices))) (call-interactively (cdr (assoc choice choices))))) ; Main function that copy the entry link and call the prompt function to download (defun elfeed-yt-dl () (interactive) (dolist (entry (elfeed-search-selected)) (when-let* ((link (elfeed-entry-link entry))) (with-temp-buffer (insert link) (clipboard-kill-ring-save (point-min) (point-max)) (option)) ))) 
 And a question too, the youtube-dl command to customize the output has this type of argument 
  -o &quot;%(title)s.%(ext)s&quot; 
 So if I use %s to pick the link variable as string, the code doesn&#x27;t work. Any idea of how could I pick the variable without using %s

                    <span>I needed a change and my friend who has been using Linux, Emacs, and programming languages in his work for decades now has mentored me through learning to build programs in Rust for my work. Even though I “know” that VSCode is what any sane person would learn, I want to learn Emacs—for writing Shell, Python, and Rust (I have a guide for using Emacs for Rust) scripts and programs; for using Latex to write essays, academic work, and for blogging. I’m going to go through all the resources in the wiki here before I ask anything else, but if you have any words of wisdom to share as I get started that would be great!

                    <span>I am using both visual-line-mode and org-indent -mode (with evil-respect-visual-line-mode).
 In an org-mode buffer when trying to move around any block of text that is indented, moving up or down lines makes the cursor jump between columns. I believe this is an issue of moving not respecting org-indent-mode but instead moving based on what the columns would look like if the buffer was unindented.
 ​
 Here is a gif demonstrating the problem.
 Here I am just moving up and down lines (no left or right commands) in an org-mode buffer with org-indent-mode on. 
 Does anyone have a solution for this? Also, should I report this as a bug or is this intended behavior?
 ​
 EDIT: 
 I found this post from 4 years ago describing a similar issue. It sounds like this was a bug then but not sure if anyone has made headway with it or reported it since. (Also if it is a bug is this a bug in org-mode or something related to visual-line-mode?)

                    <span>I have been a Doom Emacs user since I started to use emacs. I recently decided to try out Spacemacs.
 I need help.
  
Is there an equivalent of SPC . in Spacemacs other than C-x d? (to bring up dired preview). If not, can you bind it in the config?
 How do you reload the config? The equivalent of doom&#x27;s, SPC h r r or ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync?
  
I may get more questions as I go along, but here are my first ones.

                    <span>Hello Haskellers!
 I&#x27;m new to haskell and need direction on credible training providers. I&#x27;m a software engineer who&#x27;s retooling to position for blockchain, specifically dapps development on Cardano&#x27;s Plutus platform. 
 Basically, I&#x27;m seeking flexible training providers with a blend of foundational haskell curriculum and custom Plutus-focused blended curriculum. 
 Any help is appreciated!

                    <span>My question is in the title. I know it&#x27;s a bit vague, but I recently learned about org-attach. I&#x27;m intrigued by the possibility of being able to organize my files - my current Documents folder - with org-mode. I&#x27;d much prefer searching through org nodes to find the file I need (typically PDFs or saved HTML files, in my case).
 However, I&#x27;ve found the default ID generation a bit strange. I realize I can use relative directories, but it seems I would need a directory per file if I wanted only one file attached to a node. I&#x27;m just a bit hesitant to not use relative directories and continue to name my files in human-readable format since it makes me a bit more &quot;locked-in&quot; (in a sense) to org-attach, otherwise.
 So...I guess I&#x27;m just looking for ideas and inspiration. If you are, how are you using org-attach, exactly?

                    <span>Hello, I may have an opportunity coming up to drive more FP adoption at work and I am particularly interested in showing how ZIO can help us be more productive and avoid entire classes of bugs I have seen pop up often (e.g., resource leaks and OOMs). 
 A big question I foresee being asked is what happens if there is a bug in the runtime engine. ZIO is still quite new and changing fast. Someone posted a video of a bug they found in Cats Effect 3 related to memory that I can&#x27;t find right now but that is to say it&#x27;s possible for there to be bugs in the runtime engine itself. It would be a legitimate question for my team to ask: what happens if there is a bug in the core of the runtime that we can&#x27;t architect around? Is there a risk that we have to refactor a whole codebase in the future out of ZIO?
 Basically, how do I assure my team that it&#x27;s stable enough to use in production? 
 I know this question would come up (or should) with every dependency added to the codebase, but this is a big one. If you&#x27;re using a third party JSON parsing library (e.g.) and encounter a serious bug, you have more options s.a. using a different library, writing a small library that only addresses your use case (or even just the use case where the dependency has the bug), architecting around it so the bug is not on the execution path anymore, or forking the library and fixing it if you can. With a library like ZIO where the whole app runs on top of it, you may have no choice but refactor the whole thing.

                    <span>I use Typora to edit some of my Markdown files, and it creates temporary files with the filename note~.md. The problem is that The Archive seems to load these files into its DB, so although they are not present anymore, I get super annoying &quot;Problems during archive initialization, not a note: note~.md&quot; messages.
Is there any setting that I can use to ignore these files, or at least prevent this error message from popping up?</span>

                    <span>I use org-mode, have dabbled with Latex, keep a Bibtex file with entries, but I don&#x27;t really know how to put all this together if I wanted to produce a paper. For example, I see all the different formats, so I assume they&#x27;re using a standard science paper Latex template? Also, what&#x27;s the difference between citations and references and where/how do they go into a paper? Do you put them in place or down at the bottom of a page as footnotes? So yeah, what&#x27;s the difference between citations, references, and footnotes? And is there an automatic bibliography maker app?

                    <span>I had just figured out how to make the babel source code block pretty using minted and set the ATTR_LATEX: :options frame&#x3D;single. I understand that I need to put the ATTR_LATEX part before my BEGIN_SRC. It works but I have a lot of babel source codes (50+), is there a way to make this argument global instead of going back every single block and add? By global, I mean somehow put the option at the top of the document.

                    <span>This is kind of a weird one, and I&#x27;m super interested (in both an academic and practical sense) in figuring out why it&#x27;s happening - here&#x27;s a pastebin of my stripped down config file.
 Basically, I&#x27;m an evil user who&#x27;s been writing functions for org-agenda and using general to bind them. I switched from my literate config to just a plain init.el because I found it simpler and wanted to modularize my config, and to my surprise the org-agenda bindings I&#x27;d declared using general suddenly became overridden by stuff in the evil-org package. (In the config I pasted, if you comment out the :after org in the org-agenda block, then &quot;c T&quot; will call a timer function from evil-org instead of the test function I define)
 I assumed that my literate config demanded org on startup, which also demanded evi…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always wanted to navigate pdf files using the keyboard like other Emacs buffers -- so I wrote a minor mode for pdf-tools that allows this. See here.
 Since this is my first major piece of elisp code, I&#x27;d welcome any kind of suggestions on coding style, bad practices to avoid, and other improvements. 
 Also, the whole thing has a major Achilles&#x27; heel: To display the cursor it is added as a highlight into the pdf page object, which is then rendered as an image together with the rest of the page and displayed in Emacs. Each update of the cursor position hence requires a full re-rendering of the pdf page, which is quite slow at high resolutions. If anyone knows of a better way to do this, that would be fantastic!

 Is it possible to show autocomplete popup menu for filling subdirectories and files? 
 Is it necessary some plugin, can you provide the example of configuration for doom?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking into sequences. I start with the typically obtuse Wikipedia page on sequences here, then I try to imagine how all this might look in Haskell. I want to stay away from series for the time being, i.e., keep them separate.
 Here&#x27;s one Haskell sequence (with a bit of example here), and here&#x27;s another. These seem to be completely different. I&#x27;m looking at Tom Apostol&#x27;s Calculus and his short bit on sequences, also SICP, and both have examples of limits of sequences, i.e., long sequences. This seems to be about streams, so I&#x27;m guessing the second Data.Containers.Sequence is more germane?
 Somewhere I found this:
 A geometric sequence (or progression) is a sequence of elements from an ordered,numeric type (i.e., a member of both classes Ord and Num) such that consecutive elements have a fixed ratio.
 geometric :: (Ord a, Num a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; [a] geometric r m n | m &gt; n &#x3D; [] | otherwise &#x3D; m : geometric r (m*r) n 
 So this isn&#x27;t trying to be fancy at all, it&#x27;s just using lists. But then this talks about Cauchy sequences
 data Real &#x3D; Cauchy { modulus :: Nat -&gt; Nat , sequence :: Nat -&gt; Rational } 
 So this isn&#x27;t list-land anymore, although I don&#x27;t know what it is for or how to use it. If anyone has any wisdom or tips or insights, I&#x27;d appreciate. In general, I find the world of Haskell and numerical analysis very fragmented, hit-and-miss, like a scavenger hunt. It seems Haskell can bring a lot to the numerical analysis table, though.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m at the LYAH chapter on the State monad. I think I get the basic concept:
 You have a monad containing a tuple. One element is the value of the monad, the other is the environment:
 State (val, env)
 Since the value of State is the first element of the tuple, &gt;&gt;&#x3D; should return the first element of the tuple, like so:
 m &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; (\State (x, _) -&gt; f x) m
 This is not what&#x27;s said in the book; it&#x27;s just what i understand from what i know about monads. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong. And I&#x27;m certainly am, because &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and return are defined in the book like so:
  
instance Monad (State s) where
  return x &#x3D; State $ \s -&gt; (x,s) 
  (State h) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; State $ \s -&gt; let (a, newState) &#x3D; h s 
  (State g) &#x3D; f a 
 in g newState

                    <span>Hello, I decided to archive and rip all my Audio CDs to FLAC. I have all the necessary metadata in the FLAC files such as disc number, label, catalog number, etc.. but I would love to have all the information stored in an Org document as well because I believe that it is easier to navigate an Org file.
 Even though FLAC files can contain any metadata, the Vorbis specification allows that, most modern music players are unable to display tags such as catalog number so If I ever need that information I need to open each album in a separate tag viewer software which is more cumbersome than having all the information in an Org file.
 Here is an image, the way I organize the albums in Org mode: https://ibb.co/c1H6Rmd
 I was just wondering if there is a way to do a search like: display all headings that contain the name &quot;Atlantic&quot; in the &quot;LABEL&quot; tag.
 So, my question is basically if is there a way to take advantage of those drawer properties somehow in searching. It is not something very important for me but it would be cool if it&#x27;s possible.

                    <span>tldr: I use Orgzly on Android and would like a similar GUI for Windows (I&#x27;d sync a single org file between both using Syncthing). Any suggestions?
 I know this question is really about org files, rather than org mode. If there&#x27;s another more appropriate sub for this please let me know.
 I&#x27;ve been using Orgzly on Android for some time and really like the simplicity. I didn&#x27;t know about org mode before that. Although I admire the idea of a pure text based approach, I personally do need some kind of GUI, like Orgzly.

 I can&#x27;t make proper sense from the documentation and i don&#x27;t usually find solutions to my problems easily on google.
 I am weak in Logic building and coding too.

                    <span>Scalqa has a special void request type \/ with a singleton object implementation, which is also named \/. It is used to request a void instance of any type (where supported) in concise and readable manner. 
 For example:
 import scalqa.{*, given} // Scala val v: Vector[Long] &#x3D; \/ // vs. Vector.empty val v: Seq[Float] &#x3D; \/ // vs. Seq.empty val j: java.util.List[String] &#x3D; \/ val f: (Int,String) &#x3D;&gt; Unit &#x3D; \/ // vs. (_,_) &#x3D;&gt; () val l: List[String] &#x3D; \/ // vs. Nil val o: Option[Int] &#x3D; \/ // vs. None val s: String &#x3D; \/ // vs. &quot;&quot; // Scalqa val c: Collection[Double] &#x3D; \/ val o: Opt[String] &#x3D; \/ val v: ~[Double] &#x3D; \/ val b: Byte.Collection &#x3D; \/ val i: Int.Opt &#x3D; \/ val k: Long.&gt;&lt; &#x3D; \/ 
 Generally, if we create a type with void implementation, then we must define implicit void request mapping.
 class Foo object Foo: private object Void extends Foo implicit inline def implicitFrom(v: \/): Foo &#x3D; Void // now it works: val f: Foo &#x3D; \/ 
 Due to the fact that def impliciteFrom is inlined, the \/ resolution is a zero cost call.
 Take a look at real life usage examples: code1, code2, code3, code4, code5.
 \/ is by far the most used Scalqa general request, but there are many others.

                    <span>It seems that Play Framework is not actively developed anymore. There has been no release in the past months, and commits are rare (just Scala steward). It even lacks Scala 3 support. Anyone willing to provide some background why such drop in activity? I am actually very sad, since I loved play a lot (although it was a bit bloated with the final jar).
 I know akka-http is not a proper web framework, but it might work for me, since all connections to my server are done via websockets.
 However, I think these things will still be needed:
  
Sessions (jwt)
 Routing and reverse routing
 Assets and asset fingerprinting
 Handling websockets with an Actor
  
Did anyone attempt such a migration, and how did you fill these gaps? Is there a way to do migration gradually, rather than all at once?

                    <span>Hi all,
 I have an issue with my recursive function - I built it as a List function (i.e. &quot;returns&quot; a List) but now I need to turn it into a function that returns a Set.
 My custom data is:
 data Exp &#x3D; Const Int | Comp String [Exp] deriving (Show) 
 Using this data I can do the following:
 let x &#x3D; Comp &quot;a&quot; [Const 1, Comp &quot;b&quot; [], Comp &quot;c&quot; [Comp &quot;d&quot; [], Const 2]] 
 My List function looks like this:
 collection :: Exp -&gt; [String] collection (Const n) &#x3D; [] collection (Comp n args) | Data.List.null args &#x3D; [n] | otherwise &#x3D; union [n] (concat (fmap collection args)) 
 ​
 Running on GHCi, my output is:
 *Main&gt; let x &#x3D; Comp &quot;a&quot; [Const 1, Comp &quot;b&quot; [], Comp &quot;c&quot; [Comp &quot;d&quot; [], Const 2]] *Main&gt; let w &#x3D; collection x *Main&gt; w [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;] *Main&gt; :t w w :: [String] 
 What I now need is something like this:
 *Main&gt; let v &#x3D; fromList w *Main&gt; :t v v :: Set String 
 ​
 My failed attempt looks like this:
 collection :: Exp -&gt; Set String collection (Const n) &#x3D; empty collection (Comp n args) | Data.List.null args &#x3D; Data.Set.singleton n | otherwise &#x3D; fromList (union [n] (concat (fmap collection args))) 
 ​
 Obviously, this isn&#x27;t working as I&#x27;m passing a [a] into a Set [a] function but I don&#x27;t know how to work this one out.
 ​
 Thanks,
 Asian Guy

                    <span>when i update (install new version via ghcup) and then try and &quot;Set&quot; the new version as the one to use, i get this error: 
 ​
 Error: The version &quot;bin&quot; of the tool &quot;GHC&quot; is not installed.
 ​
 Im not sure what that means or now to fix it, but it makes it so that I am unable to update ghc to a newer version than what im currently using.

 I made a small Vim plugin, vim-ghci, that allows interaction with GHCi in a standard buffer, just type ge on a line, and GHCi executes it and its output is redirected into the file.

 It&#x27;s basically working but I could do with some help making a nice interface and testing cross platform. Please jump into this issue if you can help, thanks!

                    <span>Greetings.
 In Haskell, a top-level function and a lambda function which do the same thing have the same type. How can this be, when the lambda might capture some aspects of its environment? I&#x27;d imagine a regular function is just a pointer, like in other languages, but that can&#x27;t be all it is. Do lambdas dynamically allocate space for their captures, and store a pointer with the function objects, so that every function is really a function pointer plus a capture pointer, which would be null in the case of non-capturing functions? Am I wrong to even think of Haskell objects in terms of physical memory?

                    <span>That should read &quot;or functional programming in general&quot;. I did a Flutter code lab called startup name generator that lazily generated an infinite list of word pairs and now my boss told me to learn built_values library for immutability. Then there was the &quot;?&quot;, &quot;??&quot;, &quot;!&quot; syntax for null safety. Also chaining method calls and methods like take seem like they ware taken from Haskell or other functional languages. I am only a novice in both Haskell and Dartlang but can some intermediate ~ experts weigh in here?

                    <span>Sorry if the title doesn&#x27;t convey what I&#x27;m asking properly enough, I&#x27;ll expand it below.
 Lets say I have two blocks, one src and one export. The src block contains the code below, in this example. When exported as html with C-c C-e h o it becomes a code block and shows the src block literally as expected.
 #+name: test #+begin_src html  #+end_src 
 If you use the same block content as above, but put it in a export block instead, it exports the result of the code as one would expect when running C-c C-e h o, however, if you include the src block as below, it is exported literally.
 #+name: export-test #+begin_export html :noweb yes &gt; #+end_export 
 I&#x27;m quite certain that this is due to me missing something, but I&#x27;ve tried looking through the docs and search for a while now, so thought I might as well ask since I&#x27;m clearly missing something.
 I&#x27;m using a setupfile, so the appearance is a bit different, but makes no difference on the result here. I&#x27;ve tested to make sure, but aside from appearance, there&#x27;s little difference. Here&#x27;s a little screenshot of the code in the buffer, it is otherwise empty.
 I want to export it like you would if you had the code in the export block as html directly, as shown earlier. As far as I&#x27;ve found, you can&#x27;t use src blocks to export the code non-literally, and I&#x27;m messing with changing the values of some code using variables, macros and the like on export. Tangling is not relevant in this case, otherwise I&#x27;d be able to do that with a src block.
 Hopefully I&#x27;ve explained well enough, but please do ask if you need more information! I&#x27;d appreciate any help or insight into the situation :)

                    <span>Hello. I am setting up my agenda and I want to have more than a week on it. Likely, important things in a week shouldn&#x27;t be kept until the week of the scheduled item starts. If I set a higher agenda-span, org super agenda doesn&#x27;t group properly and put everything in any other week in &quot;Today&quot;. 
 https://preview.redd.it/q8rbz1encgi71.png?width&#x3D;369&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6c67c48e68450a9468f67ac76e8bf7b2b2910342
 Can I group properly with org-agenda? I am using zaen view and the groups are basically this repeated: 
  (:name &quot;Faculdade&quot; :tag &quot;fac&quot; :order 3) 
 I thought abour using org-ql, but I don&#x27;t know how to have the timestamps in items and in todays view. I hate doing this kinda of posts as I prefer try to read and figure out but it is been frustrating trying to have an agenda and not accomplishing what I want x_x. If you have a light or any directions I can take please let me know. Thanks for taking the time to read my issue &#x3D;)

 How would you use the Scala 3 deriving mechanism to derive members of this class? Doing it for a polymorphic argument type is explained in the documentation. But what about when you have something like this, where you want to have instances derived for String, Byte, Array[Byte], Json, etc?

                    <span>Hi, the title pretty much says it all. I&#x27;d like to experiment with scalafmt, but I&#x27;d like to try it out in one module only and keep Intellij formatting for the rest of the project. Is that possible?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a college student going for CS degree. We were taught the basics of programming/OOP with Java, and therefore most of our generalized CS classes had Java support.
 I&#x27;ve always hated scripting languages, loose typing, and manual memory allocation so it was hard to pick another language to try to learn (and C# is just close enough to understand but just different enough to drive me nuts). I love what I&#x27;ve learned of Scala so far, and want to make sure I don&#x27;t get anything wrong.
 I&#x27;ve been successful in following a number of tutorials in Java and converting their code to Scala because I don&#x27;t save many projects of my own. Everything runs and is great but I feel like I&#x27;m probably making some noob mistakes.
 What are some tips for a new Java-to-Scala dev student who very strongly leans towards OOP and away from functional programing?

                    <span>Hello,
How are you all taking reading notes? I have been using a notebook (a bit smaller than A5 size) to take mine. Usually I jot down things in bullet points as I read with a text. But this has been causing some issues. The actual writing takes a bit, and can be enough to get me out of the flow of reading. This usually leads to frustration as I try to write as fast as I am thinking, resulting in a barely legible scrawl. Either that or I take very few notes as I try to stay engaged with the reading material So, I wonder, am I taking notes too often? Should I wait until I am done with a certain section before jotting down ideas? The mental block I have there is that I will forget what I wanted to write down by the time I get to a stopping point.
Maybe it is not the frequency of notes, but the medium. Or maybe both. I have tried using a computer, and that does help with speed somewhat. However, that works best with digital texts, and I mostly read printed ones. Another approach I have thought of is using index cards. That does make processing later a bit easier, and you can group notes freely to see relations, but it can also get messy. What are your thoughts on using a computer for notes? Index cards?
My goal is to have a system where I can read fluidly while writing down things I would like to process later. How are you accomplishing this?</span>

Abstraction in Reflex and CodeWorld by Chris Smith
I’ve put together a neat example lately of using FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) to cleanly separate and model the interactions of the pieces of an interactive application: in this case, an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator.

                    <span>I came up with the problem when I was playing with free profunctors that I can&#x27;t (at least easily) create a free profunctor that is both Strong and Choice. Is this even possible to derive? If so, how to encode it?

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me troubleshoot this problem. When I run org-noter I get this message &quot;not enabling jit-lock: it does not work in indirect buffer&quot; in the minibuffer when the new frame opens. Additionally, none of the org-noter keybindings work, which I&#x27;m guessing is related.
 A quick google search returns this stackoverflow post suggesting org-goto wasn&#x27;t working because of multiple org installations. I&#x27;m not sure how to assess my own org installations in case it&#x27;s the same problem. 
 I&#x27;m using doom and enabling org through the init.el file. As far as I&#x27;m aware this is the only org installation I have. 
 Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!

                    <span>Context: I am looking to leverage literate programming in org-mode to create crash courses on tools for my company&#x27;s KB and also create playbooks/runbooks as org files that can be executed as needed.
 My current issue is I want to define a yaml file in an org file src block and then use that yaml file later.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is something to the effect of...
 #+NAME: docker-compose.yml #+BEGIN_SRC yaml ... #+END_SRC #+BEGIN_SRC sh docker-compose up -d #+END_SRC 
 In order for this to work org/babel would need to save the &#x60;docker-compose.yml&#x60; block as the &#x60;NAME&#x60; and then execute the shell src block. Ideally I wouldn&#x27;t want this to clog up my directory, so I&#x27;d want to avoid keeping that &#x60;docker-compose.yml&#x60; file around after we&#x27;re finished.

 This works, but will pollute the dir.…</span>

                    <span>Hi there,
 I am learning databricks and ran into an issue and hoping someone would have faced similar issue.
 I am downloading multiple files by web scraping and by default they are stored in /tmp
 I can copy a single file by providing the filename and path
 %fs cp file:/tmp/2020-12-14_listings.csv.gz dbfs:/tmp 
 but when I try to copy multiple files I get an error
 %fs cp file:/tmp/*_listings* dbfs:/tmp 
 Error
 FileNotFoundException: File file:/tmp/_listings does not exist
 Hoping someone has seen this before

I&#x27;ve been trying to structure my procrastination. I call it positive directional procrastination. These are some of the results.
@thomasteepe has got me thinking about tools for idea creation. Even though this one is specifically a digital one, I still want to credit Thomas. Maybe he&#x27;d rather I not mention him, but oh well. Also, @bradfordfournier&#x27;s idea of a label for zettel that lives on the edge of more than one graph is intriguing. You have to find them before you can label them. This is hard to do when you have 2237 zettel.
At a point in the thread Multi-edges / Named Links / Sub-graph: a means of capturing fluid associations I got excited about the idea of discovering what connections intersect at the edges of thought maps.

                    <span>I usually use 30 minute timers through my window manager to remind me to get up and stretch, switch between sitting and standing, etc. But I&#x27;m also starting up on time logging via org-mode, and now I have two timers to start at the beginning of each task increment. I see that org has a countdown timer feature, but can I get it to play a sound when the timer expires?
 If so, I&#x27;ll also want to start both timers at once. Obviously that&#x27;s a trivial function to write, but does that already exist in the code?
 (I&#x27;ve been using org for years, but in a pretty basic way; just getting in to the more sophisticated features!)

                    <span>I have two columns in a table, one containing dates (column 1) and the other containing a number (column 2). Column 1 has the same date in several rows, so what I want to do is to get the total value of the numbers in column 2 that are on rows of the same date.
 All I can find is getting the total of a column or row range, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to base the range on field values, like a date.
 Sounds simple enough, but I&#x27;m completely new to this, so I could use some help.

                    <span>Hi! 
 Just trying to link up my backend with a really simple web frontend here, I need to be able to respond to individual key presses in a html input element inside a monad that has State and Effect (or Affect). 
 I found purescript-hareactive in a previous thread, but I don&#x27;t know if this is still maintained. Not a huge deal or anything, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a better way to do this now?
 If not, it looks like maybe something with coroutines will do the trick. I saw a forum post by Jordan Martinez on the topic, but people there suggested to use a dedicated frp library. 
 Any thoughts appreciated!

                    <span>Hi everyone! Kit and I are going to be starting a new series in Zymposium on Friday at 11 AM Pacific where we work through building a full stack application with ZIO. Full description and link is below. Hope you will check it out!
 * * *
 This week we are back to the full stack! We will be embarking on building out Zeetup to be a model of a full-stack ZIO application include a server, persistence, authentication, and so on. We&#x27;ll be exploring best practices for working with layers and get practice using different ZIO ecosystem libraries as we build the solution. Come join the fun!
 Register here.

                    <span>Greetings, I have just discovered the Zettelkasten method and am in the process of setting up my Zettelkasten. I am an academic researcher in the humanities.
Sönke Ahrens recommends putting Literature Notes (summaries of texts read) in a reference manager like Zotero. What are the advantages of doing this as opposed to putting it in the main Zettelkasten software? Disadvantages seem to be that links, backlinks, and searching are not possible in Zotero notes. I cannot see any clear advantages, but maybe I am missing something?</span>

                    <span>Is it possible to hack the regular org-capture-templates to hand off to org-roam-capture? It would be nice to be able integrate both into a single menu.

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious, do those of you who are mindful with your notes and links make sure to only link to &quot;previous&quot; notes (those with a lower ID) when creating a link.
Clearly when first creating a note this is the only option, a new note is, well...new, and thus all other notes to which you might choose to link are older and thus you are pointing to previous work.
Suppose at time 1 you link 123 -&gt; 121
Fast forward into your future: what happens if you are editing 121 , and find the urge to reference something in 123, do you let yourself do this? You will now have two links (bidirectional) 123  121.
Does this contradict the ZK principle? If you don&#x27;t let this happen, I can imagine there being a lot of link maintenance that must go on to prevent yourself from accidentally creating a link which is already a back-link into a regular link?
Thoughts appreciated.

                    <span>Based on this question I asked here I&#x27;ve started using org-roam more often recently, and I use LaTeX a lot in my workflow.
 What I want to do is this:
  
Create a table in an org file with some LaTeX math symbols, using the org-mode table handler, e.g.
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable |-----|-----| | A | B | |-----|-----| | $x$ |$\mu$| |-----|-----| 
 
Export just the table to a .png or .pdf file in the directory
 
Insert the .png or .pdf image into the org-file to use as a preview.
 
 At the moment I can do this via C-c C-e C-l L and get a LaTeX buffer that I can paste into a new source block but I was thinking of something along the lines of a python source block to create a matplotlib plot as a .png. 
 Is there something I can do with the export tags, or with #+BEGIN_SCR latex?
 Or is there a way I can directly convert
 #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable |-----|-----| | A | B | |-----|-----| | $x$ |$\mu$| |-----|-----| 
 to LaTeX source, which is output into #+RESULTS, without having to use C-c C-e?

                    <span>I use A7 paper slips for my reading notes, and I know that others Zettlers use a similar approach too. But, I haven&#x27;t seen much discussion about tracking related reading notes around here.
Either way, I thought of an idea that might possibly make life a little easier for us lovers of standardized reading notes. Here it goes.
We can take inspiration in Luhmann&#x27;s numbering system to manage standardized reading notes, such as A7 paper slips:
The first note gets the address &quot;1.&quot;
If you need to postfix a new character, alternate between numbers and letters from the alphabet.
If you want to add content to a note, grab a new note, take the address of the first note, and postfix a new character in the new note.
If you want to create a note about something else, increase the first character of the …</span>

                    <span>This is a little insight that came to that I think might be helpful for some. Please let me know what you think.
If you have a Zettelkasten, you need to constantly create Zettels so it grows to give you richer connections. A day in a Zettler usually looks like this:
Create Zettels and make connections.
Read sources.
Proofread Zettels.
However, you need to manage the overall process so working with a Zettelkasten doesn&#x27;t become all you do everyday. E.g.: In the worst case scenario, you&#x27;d spend the entire morning, afternoon, and evening creating Zettels, reading, and proofreading respectively. That gives you no time for anything else!
The part of the process to manage is reading time because everything else depends on it. E.g.: If you don&#x27;t read, you can&#x27;t create Zettels, and without Zettels, there&#x27;s nothing to proofread.
I think that we can manage reading time in the same way that we adapt the routine of short knowledge cycles:
Start with 1 hour of reading.
Read, create Zettels, and proofread. Keep track of the time spent on each activity.
Reflect on the overall process.
Based on your reflection, change the time alloted for reading.
Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the work you do for your Zettelkasten, and don&#x27;t lose time for other things in your day.</span>

                    <span>This is my configuration. Org mode version 9.4.6
 (use-package org :custom ;; to be able to use #+attr_org: :width (org-image-actual-width nil) (org-startup-with-inline-images t) (org-display-remote-inline-images &#x27;download)) 
 I open foo.org file.
 [[https://github.com/larsmagne/meme/raw/master/images/Grandma-Finds-The-Internet.jpg]] 
 But nothing happens. No image is display. Where does org-display-remote-inline-images is suppose to download the image?

                    <span>As title. It&#x27;s no big deal, but I precede a lot of words with @ and it changes the color. It&#x27;s telling me something, but I can&#x27;t tell what. 
 I have tried Googling, but couldn&#x27;t dig anything up.

                    <span>Hi there, 
 I&#x27;m currently learning e/macs and have discovered org-mode and have workflow question. Currently I do all my task, project management and timelog planning through Toggl and Evernote. I use Evernote as a filing cabinet, storing important documents like contracts, tax documents etc, for quick retrieval. However I would like to get away from Evernote, due to its lack of privacy and encryption features. 
 Ideally, I would like to have everything in org-mode, that is: 
  
Notes (I&#x27;m quite ok with plain text notes)
 Files (like a plain text note such as tax agreement, which then links to the actual document)
 Time tracking for tasks and calendar apointments
 Maybe an Agile Results (a productivity system) workflow
 How can I get my tasks in org-mode etc. on my phone on iOS?
  
Is this possible to achieve in org-mode and if so, could you suggest a possible workflow? I have also looked at Joplin as a possible candidate, but it&#x27;s time tracking and todo features are insufficient for me. 
 Thanks, in advance 
 Best regards, 
 ​
 David

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to test the functionality of toList to turn a NonEmptyList a into a List a.
 First of all, there is a toList located in Data.List.NonEmpty and another located in Data.List.Types with the same type signature and I&#x27;m not sure which one I need. In general, I run into this sometimes; what do you do in these situations? Do you look at the source code and sort of figure out what you need?
 Second, I have tried with both and I get the same error for both - &quot;Could not match type NonEmpty List with type NonEmptyList&quot;. What does this mean and what do I need to do?
 Basically, my expectation would be that I can create foo &#x3D; NonEmpty 1 (2:3:4:Nil), then run toList foo and I guess I am supposed to get (1:2:3:4:Nil)? (I&#x27;m not really sure about the output which is why I&#x27;m trying to test it)

                    <span>Hey guys,
 I am trying to run purescript on doom emacs, I uncommented purescript from the init.el so purescript mode is working I get syntax highlight.
 ​
 I have the purescript compiler installed inside the node_modules and also spago. spago builds fine. 
 I am trying to get psc-ide-emacs to work with doom emacs but failing. when I use psc-ide-server-start it says it can find the executable no matter if I go to the folder itself where purs.bin is located. 
 I am using Linux.
 This is my config.el file &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp
 (use-package! psc-ide)
 (add-hook &#x27;purescript-mode-hook (lambda () (psc-ide-mode) (company-mode) (flycheck-mode) (turn-on-purescript-indentation)))
 (setq! psc-ide-purs-executable &quot;./node_modules/purescript/purs.bin&quot;) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This is my packages.el file
 list (package! psc-ide) 
 Any idea? I am new to purescript and emacs so this is getting out of hand fast

                    <span>I&#x27;m actually learning this language for a couple of months now. I don&#x27;t have any experience with Haskell. And I don&#x27;t have any colleagues or developers around to discuss the idioms or Haskell/PureScript way to code. I&#x27;m solving the AoC puzzles to learn and try to get used to it. I think the AoC 2020 d4 puzzle is the one of the best puzzles to practice how to parse and process the data after parsing. Here is my code. Can I have a code review for the idioms or a better way to use this language?

                    <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

A Brief Intro to Monad Transformers by Solomon Bothwell
A few friends have recently asked about literature introducing Monad Transformers. The best introduction I have found was in Haskell Programming From First Principles. If you don’t have, or want to purchase, this book, then here is a brief explanation with examples.
A brief intro to MTL by Jappie Klooster
That blogpost inspired me to write this, because I can’t find a succinct description on how to use MTL. I learned MTL by staring at reflex for days, if not weeks.

                    <span>Hey guys, Im trying to create an org file that displays all of my school classes and displays their times in org-agenda. None of my classes repeat every day of the week, but instead they repeat every certain set of days (i.e. one class repeats every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; and another repeats every Tuesday and Thursday). How can I create a repeating task/event that repeats every Mon,Wed,Friday or Tues,Thu and continues to repeat until a certain date (the day all classes end for exams)? I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs.

                    <span>On my quest to start a Zettelkasten, I found that most Zettelkasten tools (listed here and on reddit) have no support for hierarchies. With that I mean, methods for promoting/demoting notes in a hierarchy or folding a lower level to reduce distraction.
In Luhmann&#x27;s paper, this aspect seemed really important to him. And I can see how adding lower-level notes helps to keep notes simple and atomic. (Example: notes on cities are listed under notes for countries.)
As I am just starting with the Zettelkasten, I am worried that a non-hiearchical note list will become very confusing quickly. So, how are more experienced people handling this? Did you find software that does handle hierarchies well? Or, do you use summary notes and then link the individual parts?
Would be great to have your insight!</span>

                    <span>Got annoyed by copy and pasting dates and times from web articles, then having to clean the copied stuff up (some websites make it hard to select the date without activating a link, so you end up with the author name or whatever, too).
Here&#x27;s a simple one-liner to clean things up, requiring any Ruby installed:
ruby -e &#x27;require &quot;date&quot;; print Date.parse(ARGF.read).iso8601

It&#x27;s simpler than my previous attempts with a Python script that parses date and time, e.g. from a Zettel ID.
This reads from standard input, looks for a date inside, then prints the 2021-08-11 form of the date.
Here&#x27;s how you can test it by piping static text to the command:
echo &quot;Nassim Taleb Jun 14, 2020 · 5 min read&quot; | ruby -e &#x27;require &quot;date&quot;; print Date.parse(ARGF.read).iso8601&#x27;

You can use Keyboard Maestro, too, for this:</span>

                    <span>I am very interested in this topic/question, so I thought to spin it out to its own post instead of talking about it in a post where it isn&#x27;t as relevant

  
I&#x27;m afraid I have to disagree. There is a difference, a sliding scale, a spectrum in ZK work focused on literature, just as there is a spectrum of other types of &quot;X-driven ZK work.&quot; Moving my skills &quot;up&quot; the scales is a goal, and it is always possible to move on the scale. I have to be vigilant that I don&#x27;t backslide. Thinking and writing about the processes used in ZK work help clarify meaning. Some processes are counterproductive to our goals and there is a good chance we are blind to this - from @Will comment here


How would you rank the different tasks in terms of their utility to your zettelkasten? Here is my current ranking from top (highest utility) to bottom
Creating Combinations of Ideas
Creating Variations of Ideas
Creating Nonobvious Connections (e.g. conceptual connections)
Reformulating Ideas from Literature
Adding Notes to a Structure Note
Creating Connections based on Keywords (Obvious Connections)
Copying and Pasting Ideas from Literature
Unsure: 
* Creating Metacognitive Knowledge not for yourself, but for the zettelkasten
* Clarifying Notes
* Organizing Old Notes</span>

I&#x27;m learning about functional dependency and working around overlapping instance problems. I don&#x27;t get how purescript decides which of the two instances of Decapitate to run the decapitate function for the call within genericTail.
 Say you run genericTail &quot;hello&quot;; collection binds to type String. I get that. But nowhere within genericTail am I specifying whether element is type Char or CodePoint.
 So then how does purescript know which definition of decapitate to run? Thank you.

                    <span>How to get v1.7.x
On the Cutting Edge update channel, v1.7.0 just hit, and it brings the new MultiMarkdown-aware editor.
What&#x27;s different?
If everything goes well, then at the end of this testing phase, everything should look exactly like it did before.
But everything should be so much faster now.
If everything should look the same, what&#x27;s different?!
The editor now recognized Markdown better. Less unhandled edge cases. Less styling surprises.
But since applying theme styles is different, there are the occasional visual quirks, like the bracket colors in link definitions being color of links instead of being the color of link definitions. Please report anything you notice via email or here. I&#x27;ll be patching these mostly in the upcoming days.
Some things also look different, but on purpose:…</span>

                    <span>When searching my archive for a term, the first instance of a term in a note will have a &quot;backgroundColor&quot; that doesn&#x27;t seem to respond to the &quot;backgroundColor&quot; or the &quot;unfocusedBackgroundColor&quot;. As soon as it is selected it becomes focused and changes to the &quot;backgroundColor&quot;.
Is there a way to get the initial instance of the hit to match the highlighted backgroundColor?
Here are two screenshots showing the behavior. This is using @Basil&#x27;s PrettyFunctional theme.


After selection the first instance.</span>

and I get

 Why?
 Also, when I run log &quot;hello&quot; or something, I get &quot;Unknown value log&quot; even though Main has import Effect.Console (log). When you import Main into the repl does it not run all the import statements contained therein?

packages, with many system dependencies, and which takes very long
to build, then this post is for you. We describe herein
gazelle_cabal, a new tool that generates Haskell
rules to build with the Bazel build tool. It saves the
maintainer the trouble of writing these rules to begin with, and
then keeping them synchronized with the Cabal files whenever they
are modified.
Developer teams who want to make a gradual transition to Bazel can
continue to specify builds via Cabal files while still using Bazel to
build their artifacts.
Why Bazel?
Bazel is known to offer caching for builds of multi-language projects.
Once the cache is hot, builds can avoid rebuilding many intermediate artifacts,
shortening the overall build times. Thi…</span>

                    <span>(new to zk)
Given all the discussion of how L-style ID&#x27;s can be association-brittle relative to using just links, I was wondering if the following has an implementation in any digital system.
I&#x27;d like the following:  an L-style ref to &quot;position-sequence&quot; extended to differentiate between paths through the sequence --based on context --  in which one context path may share some im/proper subset of the other.
Example: given say 
Here we have the shared edge (xa,xb) &#x3D; (1b,1ba). And indeed it would be stultifying to assume that the meaning in context2 is partially identical to context1 simply because of the shared referential sub-structure.
Question: for the advocates of links only: is there a simple way to differentiate multiple referential contexts. I.e., to allow for the same edge/link to be given different meaning.
This could be via named links -- not just links named for their nodes, or multi-links, or some in-note context to mimic this behavior.
Does such a thing exist?</span>

                    <span>The PureScript teams are moving from the Functional Programming Slack to our dedicated PureScript Discord server. You can join here: https://purescript.org/chat
 The Slack channel will continue to exist, but as an unofficial gathering space only. To learn more about why we&#x27;re migrating to Discord, please see this announcement:https://discourse.purescript.org/t/migrating-to-discord/2493
 See you in there!
