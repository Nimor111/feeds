                    <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

                    <span>Emacs 3rd party dependencies and user home integration can be well managed using Nix. Posimacs is a published example.
 I&#x27;ve updated the example. It now uses nix flakes. The elisp files can be maintained as a dirty tree for happy hacking. Home manager is mainly used for the static aspects of user home integration rather than installing the elisp files read-only. I will be installing this on a Darwin machine sometime today.
 The Scheme
  
Straight for elisp packages &amp; lockfiles
 Home manager for dotfiles
 Nix expressions for distributing 3rd party deps
  
Forewarning, the Emacs lisp is not marketed as good. At anything. My git tree is dirty. I mainly use the vterm integration and Rust Analyzer.
 The Future
  
Emacs can maintain its own nix profile to have a self-contained set of 3rd party dependencies like language servers and dynamic modules independently of the user environment
 Emacs can generate a home manager module for programs like vterm that want home integration
 Emacs can maintain non-package elisp configuration expressions without resorting to rigid git managed structures or rapidly decaying patchworks lifted from literate org files scattered around
  
The mix of tooling is the main work output of this project so far. Appreciate pointing out any work related to the Future

                    <span>What the subject says... What was the first thing that you changed/ configured back when started using Emacs?
 On my case was getting all those pesky &quot;~&quot; backup files on one place... I hated how those splattered all around.

                    <span>Thanks to Po Lu, Emacs&#x27;s pgtk port could use xwidgets to browse web pages. You don&#x27;t need to install any external packages, just compile the newest source code of Emacs (at least newer than this commit by Po Lu) with &quot;--with-pgtk&quot; together with &quot;--with-xwidgets&quot; flags. Then M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url and enter a url, you could surf the Internet via Emacs!
 For people not familiar to this: pgtk port is the feature Emacs use pure GTK, which means it could run under pure Wayland. Xwidgets is a feature that allows Emacs to display GTK and NS widgets inside buffers. Xwidgets doesn&#x27;t support pgtk before, Po Lu made it support pgtk.

                    <span>EDIT: Never mind! The function I was looking for is M-x indent-relative. That solves my problem. I can combine that with return to make a custom function to do what I want.
 Writing a shell script, Emacs adds 4 tabs and 1 space. I don’t want this to happen. I want Emacs to go to the first character in the previous line. Emacs is going wild with auto-formatting. I want electricity. I like electricity. But I don’t like auto-formatting. That is, I don’t like tons of random tabs and spaces added for no reason.
 for in i in 1 2  
 I don’t want that. I want :
 for in i 1 2  
 M-x electric-indent-mode doesn’t work, because then I lose electricity, which is also problematic. I like electricity, but I don’t like auto-formatting. Turning off electricity isn’t good:
 for in i 1 2 do  
 I want the cursor to be aligned with the do, not at the beginning of the line. Does anyone know how to do this?

                    <span>Just saw that a few hours ago Org-transclusion 1.1.1 has been released and is available on ELPA.
 https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion
 A tip of the hat to Nobiot for writing this amazing package.
 I&#x27;d been waiting for the first release before integrating it into my workflow and now I&#x27;m out of excuses :).
 What a wonderful gift to the emacs community to end out a difficult (I would say horrible) year and end it with hope and optimism going into 2022.
 Thank you Nobiot! Happy New Year to all; wishing that your init.el file be bug free in the coming Year of The Tiger.

                    <span>I often need to use indent-region from indent.el to fix the indentation of code template I have from school. So I made this function :
 (defun indent-buffer () (interactive) (if (not (string&#x3D; major-mode &#x27;python-mode)) (indent-region (point-min) (point-max)) (message &quot;Not in python&quot;))) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-i&quot;) &#x27;indent-buffer) 
 It works well but I recently found out that the default indentation is only 2 space char. I would like to have it inserting 4 chars width TABS. I tried to look in the customization group of indent.el and even used kernel coding style emacs config, which works when I press  but doesn&#x27;t when using (indent-buffer).

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 TL;DR: Can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 I recently heard of mini-frame-mode and fell in love. While I see the need to have a vertical display for functions and variable descriptions (marginalia ftw!), I have always been irritated by a new buffer appearing &quot;out of nowhere&quot; on the bottom of my screen, moving the modeline etc.
 So, I have adjusted the looks of mini-frame-mode to my liking. Now, there is one piece missing: whenever I push to my git repository, mini-frame-mode opens to prompt me for my git auth data. I don&#x27;t want mini-frame-mode to handle this; instead, I want the password prompt to appear in the original mini buffer on the bottom.
 I know of the mini-frame-ignore-commands variable. However, I don&#x27;t know which program is evoked by emacs to ask me for the password. I tried skimming the Messages Buffer for it, but adding magit-process-username-prompt and magit-process-password-prompt to the list didn&#x27;t change anything, and I was unable to find a reference to another function in the packages&#x27; code.
 Thus: can you tell me which function emacs invokes to ask for auth data?
 Have a good day, folks :)

                    <span>While trying to make the switch back to emacs from vscode. I have this issue. I&#x27;ve created my own colorschemes in vscode with customized fonts per language tokens. 
 Where i can easily adjust font size, colors, or any attributes for tokens in a .json file, and by inspecting tokens in the editor with (Ctrl+Shift+P) (for Editor Tokens and Scopes in the Command Palette). I can specify in the json for any token category in the textmate grammar any font size, color, attribute etc.....
 Can the same be accomplished in emacs, and what resources/links should I be looking at to work on porting over my colorscheme for this?

                    <span>This is something I was thinking about for quite some while now. 
 I&#x27;m an undergrad student very interested in Haskell and functional programming in general. Doing some stuff in my spare time, however, isn&#x27;t quite satisfying and I want to learn more, especially how it would look to write actual production Haskell. 
 That is why I would like to apply for an internship or job in Haskell. But here comes the problem: 
 All job offers for Haskell programmers either require years of experience with Haskell in production and/or a PhD. 
 I think this is a problem because: 
  
If nobody offers a job for beginners to work with Haskell, how does the community want to get new people who have worked years in Haskell that don&#x27;t come from academia? 
 
How will there be more programmers writing Haskell in…</span>

                    <span>I have observed some strange GHC behavior while working on my $DAYJOB project that I&#x27;d like to report as an issue on the GHC bug tracker. To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I&#x27;m having trouble doing that though:
 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? 
 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what&#x27;s the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I&#x27;ve built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can&#x27;t figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I&#x27;ve also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I&#x27;m supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don&#x27;t like doing that if at all possible.
 It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I&#x27;m also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.
 Thanks for any pointers!

                    <span>Hello haskellers,
 I know this question has been asked in the past, but I&#x27;m hoping to get a more modern answer :&#x27;)
 Are there any recommended resources for learning category theory and haskell?
 Some background info, I have a math undergrad degree, and I had fun with the pure math, proofs, theorems, etc. so I&#x27;d love to dive deeper into the formal math behind category theory.
 After graduating, I&#x27;ve had a few different roles before landing a software engineer position about 6 months ago... mainly working with JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js.
 I&#x27;ve also worked through the JavaScript Mostly Adequate Guide to FP, which further piqued my interest in FP, also learned some basic Clojure and used it for Advent of Code this year.
 Has anyone worked through the MIT course, Programming with Categories? Does this seem like a good place to start? Leafing through the textbook, it seems to strike a good balance between the formal math and introducing haskell basics. I was thinking of working through it, then work through a more in-depth haskell resource after (i.e. learn you a haskell or something).
 What did you use to learn category theory and/or haskell?
 Thanks in advance for your input!

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on my &quot;adulting.&quot; I&#x27;m reviewing and setting habits to help guide me in times of lower clarity. Looking at ideas for creating a tool for thinking, I came up with a tool that prompts me to refine the edits to zettel titles and &#x27;summary relevance.&#x27;
This &#x27;tool for thinking&#x27; results from a python program tied to Keyboard Maestro that prompts me to review titles and summaries of the last ten days of newly created zettel. As an anchor, it is tied to my practice of morning journaling. It reminds me and makes it convenient to examine each zettel title and the one-sentence &#x27;relevance&#x27; statement to see if it makes sense and stands up to scrutiny. This is added to the bottom of that template. (pictured below) Automatic, easy peasy, the cognitive load of the initiating behavior habit off-loaded to the computer. This is not an excuse for not editing the body of each zettel. A new zettel will be on the list for ten days. That means ten opportunities for giving the zettel some love.
I&#x27;m unsettled on the format. In its current form it is a bit hard to read. I will make changes for readability.
If you&#x27;re interested in how this is done, have questions about my use-case, or just want to chat let me know.
Below are pictured titles and a one-sentence summary/meaning of the zettel I&#x27;m working on. These are the ideas I&#x27;m currently wrestling with. They represent a ten-day window of new zettel.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.</span>

                    <span>Hey all, what is the best way to save the entire window as highest resolution image file (not just each buffer). I think a screenshot will not provide the best available resolution on a Mac machine. I know htmlfontify-buffer but this is cumbersome as it saves one buffer each time.

                    <span>So the idea is that no matter what you&#x27;re doing the LSP server generates documentation and refactoring tools for whatever you&#x27;re looking at -- whether you&#x27;re surfing the web through emacs, looking at photos, talking to people, or writing code. And should also be able to plug this into other editors. One LSP server for everything. So far you can only try it out from within the docker container. Start pen, open a text file, python, elisp, etc. and run lsp. Anyway, I&#x27;m going to continue working on this into next year.

 Surf is the only browser that supports XEmbed protocol. So now you can use it in GNU Emacs to browse rich web.

                    <span>Hi all. Question about Emacs config.
 I use straight.el to manage packages. I also use use-package for configuration. I have use-package configured to use straight.el. I&#x27;m using the development version org-mode, which was fantastic, until Emacs 28 started shipping with v9.5, which is all I need. The built-in version seems to load much quicker than the one I have. (I&#x27;m not byte compiling my init files; maybe I should do that?) Is there a way to make use-package use the built-in version of org-mode even though I&#x27;ve got straight-use-package-by-default set to t?

                    <span>I was a bit surprised when find-file in an occur buffer sent me to another directory than that one of the file being trawled through.
 The following advice fixes that.It sets default-directory of the occur buffer to that one of the trawled file.
 (defun filesTZA-occur-default-directory (fun &amp;rest args) &quot;Set &#x60;default-directory&#x27; in occur buffer. FUN is called with ARGS.&quot; (let* ((dir default-directory) occur-buf (occur-hook (cons (lambda () (setq occur-buf (current-buffer))) occur-hook))) (prog1 (apply fun args) (when (buffer-live-p occur-buf) (with-current-buffer occur-buf (setq default-directory dir)))))) (advice-add &#x27;occur :around #&#x27;filesTZA-occur-default-directory)

                    <span>I use line-number-mode whenever I&#x27;m in a coding environment, but when writing prose in org-mode I obviously have no need for a running line number count. However, I still appreciate an indicator in the fringe that shows the beginning of each new line when I’m dealing with dense paragraphs. Is it possible to put a custom symbol in the fringe in place of where line numbers would be? Thanks for any help!

                    <span>I have a few packages on MELPA; can I submit those to ELPA and Non-GNU ELPA as well? Or should I choose one?
 What&#x27;s the community&#x27;s opinion on this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m just starting out with babel and can&#x27;t get the example code to run (http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-gnuplot.html#sec-4) :
 #+begin_src gnuplot :exports code :file file.png reset set title &quot;Putting it All Together&quot; set xlabel &quot;X&quot; set xrange [-8:8] set xtics -8,2,8 set ylabel &quot;Y&quot; set yrange [-20:70] set ytics -20,10,70 f(x) &#x3D; x**2 g(x) &#x3D; x**3 h(x) &#x3D; 10*sqrt(abs(x)) plot f(x) w lp lw 1, g(x) w p lw 2, h(x) w l lw 3 #+end_src 
 This only produces the output: Cannot open load file: no such file or directory, gnuplot
 I have gnuplot installed and also included the following in my init.el file:
 (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((emacs-lisp . t) (gnuplot .t) (python . t)))

                    <span>I work as a Positive Behaviour Support Practitioner with people with disabilities and complex needs. In this, the primary document that I create for all my clients is their Behaviour Support Plan (BSP).
 A BSP is a long and complex document: with many sections and sub-sections, various tables and prompts for me (which aren&#x27;t exported). All of which org-mode can achieve just beautifully. 
 As the BSP is such a critical clinical document - I spend a lot of time thinking about and tweaking this document. This may include changing wording in a heading, re-ordering sections, or creating/removing a section altogether.
 This is where my problem comes in. Having now made a change on my template, how do I go about propagating this change across all the existing BSPs I already have?

There are 4 different labs in Go lang I plan to redo in Scala (MapReduce, Raft, Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service, Sharded Key/Value Service). There is also a bunch of lectures available on YouTube: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html. I would like to know if there is any interest in forming a study group to motivate each other to complete this course and work on the labs together.

                    <span>I want to use the org-capture-template to record my weight into a table. So I used the following to construct the template :
 (&quot;mw&quot; &quot;Weight&quot; table-line (file+headline &quot;~/Projects/Metrics.org&quot; &quot;Weight&quot;) 
 &quot;| %U | %^{Weight} | %^{Notes} |&quot; :kill-buffer t)
 However, when I use org capture, my tables end up being misaligned as shown below. How can I fix this alignment issue?

                    <span>When creating tasks using org-capture, I try to provide as much context as i can, so it might take 2-3 mins to create one task. this would make my agenda look messy because of these tasks with short clocked time. 
 ​
 I wonder if there&#x27;s an easy way to create a function/hook that removes the clock drawer if the clocked minute is less than a threshold, say 5 mins?
 ​
 There is something similar in org-mode already, when the variable org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks is set to true, empty clock drawers are removed after org-clock-out.

                    <span>Recently I downloaded and installed the emacs from https://emacsformacosx.com/
  
As I install it the spacemacs configuration is by default configured.
 How can I remove it since lot of unwanted features already enabled which I don&#x27;t want.
 I was thinking of configuring the emacs from scratch for clojure development.
 Also I can see the lag while switching buffers and in execution while using spacemacs.

                    <span>Some time ago I could evaluate code blocks using #+begin_src sclang .... #+end_src in my org file. But not anymore. Highlight syntax is okay inside the block but when I execute with C - c C - c I get this: &quot;No org babel execute function for sclang&quot;. Sclang seems to be supported by Babel and Org (https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html) but since it was working there is no doubt sclang is supported anyways. I am also ensuring that a working installation of sclang is functional and on when executing the block. 
 I am also setting it to (require &#x27;sclang) before anything, so cannot think anything else. Executable of the lang is declared as well and functioning okay! 
 All in all, the language is working in its mode so there is nothing else that points a reason to investigate and also when trying other languages in such as js it works okay with results appearing as expected outside the source block.
 #+begin_src js console.log(&quot;hello&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : hello : undefined 
 I have activated sclang using this below:
 (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((sclang . t)))

                    <span>I would like to add classes to HTML that is output from Org mode. For instance, if I used C, then the following Org:
 #+begin_src c int main(void) { return 0; } #end_src 
 Will produce HTML that has the following classes:
 
 int main ( void ) { return 0; } 
 
 However, I am interested in providing the same for “non-out-of-the-box” languages like Swift and Kotlin. There are “ob-“ modes for these languages, and when looking at it in Emacs, they are highlighted. However, I only get plain text.
 Note, I am doing something a bit strange: instead of using my usual Doom Emacs configuration for exporting, I have created a batch script that I…</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I sometimes use emacs in the terminal but emacs shortcuts and terminal shortcuts clash. 
 Is there a way to disable terminal shortcuts not to clash with Emacs or is there a terminal emulator I can use that supports non-GUI Emacs fully? 
 Thanks for the help.
 Edit : 
 I use urxvt on Manjaro, I have a problem with C- being sent to C-h and commands such as M-s not being recognized.

                    <span>I am trying to use the Super key in an input method. Specifically, I would like to press Super + a followed by apostrophe to get á, etc. The following:
 (quail-define-rules (&quot;s-a &#x27;&quot; [&quot;á&quot;])) 
 and various escaped versions of it do not have the intended result. What can I do?

 (setq-default indicate-empty-lines t) 
 Where is this special glyph actually define? I mean I want to see this glyph defined somewhere in text format that I can copy and paste. I looked at C-h v fringe-indicator-alist but it simply shows this
 ((truncation left-arrow right-arrow) (continuation left-curly-arrow right-curly-arrow) (overlay-arrow . right-triangle) (up . up-arrow) (down . down-arrow) (top top-left-angle top-right-angle) (bottom bottom-left-angle bottom-right-angle top-right-angle top-left-angle) (top-bottom left-bracket right-bracket top-right-angle top-left-angle) (empty-line . empty-line) (unknown . question-mark)) 
 But where can I see the literal value of empty-line?

                    <span>I can&#x27;t seem to load doom with chemacs2. I tried to follow the steps and I want to test out different distros. I basically blew away my install and got regular emacs, witchmacs, and doom-emacs in a folder called ~/emacs/ then cloned chemacs2 per the instructions. My ~/.emacs-profiles.el looks like this:
 ((&quot;default&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacs/default&quot;)))
 (&quot;doom&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacs/doom-emacs&quot;)
 (env . ((&quot;DOOMDIR&quot; . &quot;~/doom.d&quot;)))))
 (&quot;witchmacs&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/emacs/witchmacs&quot;))))
 line three I&#x27;m not sure about, but I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s supposed to go there. I can load the default GNU emacs, and witchmacs, no problem. But when I try to run emacs --with-profile doom I get this:
 |Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading&#x27; /Users/moshepaul/.emacs.d/init.el&#x27;: |File is missing: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, core-modulesAnybody have an idea where I&#x27;m going wrong?

                    <span>If I split a window vertically or horizontally, so that I have the same window shown several times, when I do M-x helm-mini , it shows as many entries with that name as windows showing the buffer. I&#x27;ve checked with emacs -Q to ensure it is not my config file, and the same thing happens. But I can&#x27;t find any variable to alter this behavior. I&#x27;d like a single entry per buffer, even if it is shown in multiple windows.
 What am I missing here?

                    <span>Since I switched to the developer version of emacs, on my latest Ubuntu distribution, I cannot use the &quot;C-.&quot; (or &quot;ctrl .&quot;) keyboard shortcut anymore. As soon as I press it, a strange &quot;e&quot; box appears on the screen (see screenshot) and emacs hangs until I press ESC or &quot;C-.&quot; again.

 This does not happen if I start emacs in the terminal (emacs -nw)
 Is anyone else seeing this?
 How can one find out if this bug has been filed?

                    <span>As an example, I want to export a special block called #+begin_card that I want it to have a specific export configuration. Do I need to create a derived back-end? I know it is an easy process it&#x27;s just that I then need to call this new back-end instead of the html one.
 What if I have one export back-end for this card and another back-end for a mermaid.js export, how can I mix both back-ends as both change the same function? Can&#x27;t I just extend the html backend with more functions for other special blocks?

                    <span>I landed here and saw something I&#x27;d never seen before, namely,
  
Maybe satisfies the type equation FX &#x3D; 1 + X, where the functor F takes a set to a point plus that set.
  
It sounds brilliant, but I don&#x27;t know what any of that means. (I have only a beginner&#x27;s understanding of what a functor is.) Where can I start learning?

                    <span>Hello everybody,
 I wanted to reach out to the reddit community about haskell salaries. The only other reddit thread on the topic I could find was from 8 years ago, so I was curious if things have changed in the past 8 years.
 According to the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Haskell developers seem to make much less than some other &quot;functional&quot; languages (i.e. Clojure, F#, Elixir). Do you find this to be true in your experience?
 I&#x27;d also be interested to hear about haskell salaries in the US vs elsewhere.
 If you would like, feel free to share your salary here (for others to reference), but no pressure!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve started a translation from Common Lisp to Scala of Forbus and de Kleer&#x27;s tools from their Building Problem Solvers. At this point I have working versions of two of the more useful of their tools, the justification- and assumption-based truth maintenance systems (JTMS and ATMS).
 Truth maintenance systems track the relationships among possible beliefs, reasoning rules, incompatible/contradictory beliefs, and the conclusions we might draw from them. The JTMS stores a single context of which beliefs we might adopt; the ATMS tracks all of the various environments which might support the possible beliefs without contradiction. TMSes can guide search in reasoning engines, or can directly serve as models for program domains.
 The JTMS and ATMS code here are simple translations of F&amp;dK&#x27;s implementation, translated with minimal changes into Scala. Part of my motivation is to have a deeper look at their code, and I&#x27;ll likely add documentation in the next few weeks, and possibly additional tool translations.
 On Scaladex or Github. Enjoy.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve discovered iedit, which allows me to C-; over any string and edit all occurrences of it simultaneously, à la multiple-cursors. The default behaviour is that, by pressing C-; only once, it selects all occurences of the string in the whole buffer. Is there a way to expand the selection to each new match one at a time? For those familiar with, I&#x27;m basically trying to replicate Sublime Text&#x27;s functionality when you Ctrl/Cmd-D over any string.
 iedit documentation mentions that &quot;Many other work flows to highlight occurrences are possible, for example, (...) incremental selection&quot;, which sounds exactly like what I want. But looking through the documentation, available functions, and even the source code, I couldn&#x27;t find the answer.
 Thaks for any help.

                    <span>In css-mode, if I enable hs-minor-mode and start folding blocks with hs-toggle-hiding, I cannot unfold it with hs-toggle-hiding again. I can reproduce this in emacs -Q, just try folding this in css-mode with hs-toggle-hiding (after turning on hs-minor-mode):
 p { margin: 1rem 0; } 
 For reference, this is the definition of hs-toggle-hiding:
 (defun hs-toggle-hiding (&amp;optional e) &quot;Toggle hiding/showing of a block. See &#x60;hs-hide-block&#x27; and &#x60;hs-show-block&#x27;. Argument E should be the event that triggered this action.&quot; (interactive) (hs-life-goes-on (posn-set-point (event-end e)) (if (hs-already-hidden-p) (hs-show-block) (hs-hide-block)))) 
 This is happening because for some reason (posn-set-point (event-end nil)) (as e is nil when hs-toggle-hiding is run as a command) would move point to somewhere that makes hs-already-hidden-p always return nil.
 Currently I&#x27;m patching the function in my config by only running posn-set-point if e is non-nil:
 (when e (posn-set-point (event-end e))) 
 which fixes it.
  
I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m the only person who has encountered this issue. Is this a known issue and has it perhaps been fixed in Emacs 28?

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to set org-level-* height(font size) differently for each level(doom emacs, config.el):
 (after! org (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-1 nil :height 1.75)) 
 But it displays different height only on frame that uses window-system. I&#x27;m using OSX so ns
 , in this case.
 When I use frame on terminal(iTerm) it displays default height.
 I think it should work with iTerm since iTerm is also uses graphical display.
 But the result of (window-system)or (display-graphic-p) is nil
 Is it not possible to start emacs on terminal with window system?

                    <span>In 2022 I aim to become more accustomed with the Linux Kernal and to finally become fluent in the C programming language, with emacs as my environment for doing that. But there are so many fields open to us now. I&#x27;d love to hear what your plans are for next year and beyond..

                    <span>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the word is more suited for copy/cut (like in vi/vim) than paste (Emacs).
 Does anybody knows or have references for why this specific word was chosen?
 Is this some mistake carried through times?

                    <span>Hello, maybe this is too trivial to ask, but is this a method which only exists in other configurations of Emacs or comes in Emacs as well. I am using this language package which is not in MELPA yet, so I am installing it like below. Also, are there any issues that one has to be aware using this method of cloning packages like this. Again, sorry if this is too obvious to ask.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently switching python IDE to move to full emacs. I&#x27;m therefore trying to take with me the few things I really liked from my former python IDE (Spyder) and add all the new features that made me move to emacs.
 One important step for me is to replicate the Spyder Dark Theme within Emacs (because I like it, am used to it and am not really satisfied with other ones I tried so far). What I have, is the spec of the theme that you can see in the screenshot attached.
 Unfortunately now I am really stuck in how to proceed to convert those hex colors to an emacs custom theme, as a complete emacs newbie... Any help would be much appreciated!
 ​
 Have a nice holiday season!

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is something that&#x27;s okay to post here, but I figure I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I wrote this C++ Yasnippet script a few months ago, and I use it basically every day.
 # -*- mode: snippet -*- # name: function # key: fn # contributor: conscat # -- ${3:$(map-void yas-text &quot;void &quot; &quot;auto &quot;)}${1:name}($2)${3:$(map-void yas-text &quot;&quot; &quot; -&gt; &quot;)}$3 { $0 } 
 The most interesting part is map-void, which I define like this:
 (defun map-void (check replace-t replace-f) (interactive) (if (string&#x3D; check &quot;&quot;) replace-t replace-f)) 
 Here&#x27;s what it does:
 I type fn, then press TAB. That expands into this (white space a little different). The | represents my cursor:
 void |func() {}
 I can type in a function name here. I press TAB again:
 void foo(|) {}
 Now I can type in a parameter list, and TAB again:
 void foo(int moo)| {}
 Now here&#x27;s the cool part. If I type in anything, a -&gt; is automatically inserted, and the void at the front becomes auto!
 auto foo(int moo) -&gt; boo|{}
 And then I TAB into the body of my function and type the rest. I know it&#x27;s not that crazy, but it&#x27;s the ability to just do these kind of neat hacks that makes me appreciate Emacs so much.

                    <span>Title basically. I installed emacs-mac. Running: emacs and emacsclient -t open it up in the terminal, as expected. Running /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs opens a gui.
 I expected emacsclient -c to open up a GUI attached to the emacs daemon. But that command too opens it up in the terminal.
 Thanks
 Edit (tl;dr): how do I open Emacs in GUI attached to the emacs daemon.

                    <span>Are there any packages that support bookmarks that can be saved to disk, stored per &quot;project&quot; (where a project is a projectile/ffip/vc-repository - for example).
 The bm package looks like it might be configurable per-project, although it would require some hacking to support that, and even more hacking to support it properly (to support multiple projects loaded in a single emacs session).
 Another limitation of bm is it only exposes bookmarks in open buffers, again, I can hack in support to show all stored bookmarks for the repository I&#x27;m working on, but this isn&#x27;t trivial - it may be simpler to use a package that already supports this.

 I have the following different equivalent working approaches, in order of discovery:

 I&#x27;ve just published a new Blog Post on a classic implementation technique for lazy functional programming: combinatory logic based graph-reduction engine.
 The implementation is structured into three parts:
  
A λ-calculus parser from A Combinatory Compiler which was extended to cover a tiny functional language based on the untyped λ-calculus.
 A compiler from λ-calculus to combinatory logic combinators (S,K,I,B,C and Y) which is based on bracket-abstraction and some optimization rules.
 A graph-reducer. Combinator terms are allocated into a graph data-structure. Which is then reduced by applying combinator graph-reduction. The destructive inplace reduction of the graph is made possible by using STRef
 mutable references.

                    <span>Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I&#x27;ve decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I&#x27;m having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I&#x27;ve come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here&#x27;s an example of something I want to do in Elixir:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elixir
 This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number
 &gt;
  
&gt;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 On Haskell I&#x27;ve tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell
 B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000
 :61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]
 Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807
 &quot;AAB4iX/DNTs&#x3D;&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)
 ​
 So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I&#x27;m missing?

                    <span>During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don&#x27;t have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:
  
Parse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.
 Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.
  
conduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well. See haddock for examples and documentation. Here is one such example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
  
:set -XOverloadedStrings :set -XTypeApplications import Conduit let input &#x3D; &quot;{ \&quot;foo\&quot;: 1, \&quot;bar\&quot;: 2, \&quot;baz\&quot;: 3 }&quot; runConduit $ yield input .| conduitObject @String @Int .| printC (&quot;foo&quot;,1) (&quot;bar&quot;,2) (&quot;baz&quot;,3) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>In a previous post How to count tags co-occurrences in a buffer and put them in a matrix I talked about a simple way to &quot;link&quot; to a sparse tree. 
 So, if you have a &quot;tagA&quot; and like to see where it appears in the buffer, just create a link as &#x27;tag-sparse:tag&#x27; and follow it. 
 Here it is the custom type link. :)
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (org-add-link-type &quot;tag-sparse&quot; &#x27;em/sparse-tree-tag-link) (defun em/sparse-tree-tag-link (tag) &quot;Makes a sparse-tree from the linked tag.&quot; (org-occur tag)) #+end_src 
 That&#x27;s it. Short, simple and sweet. I hope someone finds it useful. :)

                    <span>Dear fellow Orgers...
 TLDR: how to count tags in a buffer and put them in a matrix where each cell counts the co-occurrences of both tags in a heading?
 The long story: thematic analysis is a quite common technique used to synthesize meaning in texts (those interested in a brief but good introduction, please peek https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/thematic-analysis/). In short, once done each idea in a text is marked by a tag, and then you can synthesize a text by it&#x27;s tags (of course, we can also group them, but that comes after) and different texts can be compared by it&#x27;s found tags.
 As we all know, emacs is a great operating system and comes not only with org-mode but also with a decent editor ;) so it was a logical idea to use both to do thematic analysis. And in the end, it seems t…</span>

                    <span>During the last months, me and my girlfriend moved our note taking, planning etc. from TiddlyWiki to Emacs OrgMode and so far we both like it. But there is one big thing im missing: &quot;dynamic aggregation&quot;.
 In TiddlyWiki I can automatically query and format many information throughout the Wiki. Easy tasks like displaying a table of all D&amp;D sessions is achievable with the column mode, but how about more complex aggreagations? For my studies, I created tiddlers for every subject including information for CP, semester, and category. In my overview, each semester is listed as seperate heading with the subjects being displayed by category as description lists and the CP summed up for each category. Please refer to the screenshot.
 In TiddlyWiki I can use filter expressions to select any tiddler (entry) from the wiki and extract data from it. This data can be transformed into arbitrary HTML, which is rendered when the article is visited. This query and transformation is done in the Wiki&#x27;s own syntax, which is a part of the reason I wanted to switch to Emacs.
 How would I recreate this in OrgMode? I&#x27;m okay with having all information in one file and don&#x27;t mind to learn elisp. What I would like to have is the information to be displayed inline (not in another buffer) and being able to use all or most of OrgModes usual formatting options.

                    <span>I stumbled on a certain feature some time ago, and completely forgot where I found it.
 But I remember what it does:
  
find every occurrence of some regex, say &quot;printf,&quot; recursively in a directory tree (call this the &quot;gather&quot; step)
 populate a buffer with every line matching that regex; edit in that buffer as if it were a file
 on &quot;save,&quot; have every modified line &quot;scattered&quot; back out to its original file
  
Anyone kind enough to point out a package that does this or something close to it?

                    <span>I am new to Haskell. My motivation for learning is mostly curiosity. I’ve heard that it’s a different way of thinking about problems and solutions and I am giving it a try. 
 I am also interested in building a simulation engine for game like Majesty (a medival game where all characters are autonomous). Would this be something that would make sense to do in Haskell? I’m not talking about the graphics or other components. As a noob it seems that each unit/node will carry a lot of state so maybe not. But I want to hear from someone who knows about Haskell

                    <span>I&#x27;m studying Haskell with &quot;Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!&quot;
 I&#x27;m at page 30, where there&#x27;s an example of an error message from ghci when running: read &quot;4&quot;
 I just noticed that if I run it in my ghci I get a totally different feedback: instead of the expected
 &quot;Ambiguous type variable &#x27;a&#x27; in the contstraint:...&quot;
 I get a totally different response:
 &quot;*** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse&quot;
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is expected or if it&#x27;s something related to my installation of Haskell.
 For the record: I installed Haskell (version 9.0.1) through stack.

                    <span>Hi, I am new to haskell so this might be a noob question.
 Let&#x27;s say I have a function
 haskell sequenceMaybe :: [Maybe a] -&gt; Maybe [a]  This allows me to do things like haskell sequenceMaybe [Just 1, Just 4]  where a is inferred to be Int. All is well
 But what if I have an array like haskell [Just 1, Just &quot;mystring&quot;]  is there a way to write a function that will abstract over all these types? I only need a function that return true if any of the Maybes is Nothing, or false otherwise. So I do not need any constraint on the inner type.
 Many thanks!

                    <span>Out of interest how many of you here are working on the cardano Blockchain given that only Haskell is the available language to develop with.
 Btw I&#x27;m a .net developer in my day job, if I were to get into development for cardano are there any useful readings or links you could provide. 
 I was going to look at the Haskell course on future learn. (I have developed with F# in my hobby projects)

                    <span>Hi all, I just used ghcup to update the GHC version to 9.2.1, which is the version that brings a lot of support for M1 processors if I understood correctly. Does this mean that the compiler already knows how to use ARM natively? 
 The reason I am asking is just because there tends to be a choice when downloading an installation file of Intel vs Apple Silicon. Thanks everyone!

                    <span>I can only assume that the official example of org-capture having a journal entry means that a fair few people use them as a journal entry. However, if I am writing my journal entry at 2 in the morning, it appears in the tree for the next day. Is there any way to modify the entry automatically (even if it means I have j for journal and another binding for &quot;journal but a day ago&quot;) ? I can wind up with nights as late as 5 AM, so it&#x27;s rough on keeping organized.

                    <span>I am trying to get emacs native compliation working, and keep running into the following error.
 {.example} error: Cannot find libgccjit library 
 I have tried installing emacs with native compliation a number of ways
  
 Downloading and compiling from emacs master branch
  Downloading and compiling emacs-ng from master branch
  Downloading from snap edge
  
all resulting in some variation of error being unable to find libgccjit, for example another one reads
 {.example} Error (use-package): projectile/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging Error (use-package): org-roam/:config: Cannot find libgccjit library Disable showing Disable logging 
 Running on pop~os~
 I thought that I may not have the right version of libgccjit installed, but it appears that I have versions for gcc 9, 10, and 11 installed (default gcc is v11)
 {.example} $&gt; find /usr/lib/gcc/ -type f -name &quot;*jit*&quot; /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/include/libgccjit++.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit.h /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/libgccjit++.h 
 I can succesfully compile and run the jit example from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html without issue.
 Any suggestions on what I need to do to get emacs to find the right libgccjit?
 Edit: Thank you, the problem has been resolved. I actually had some code in my init.el which was causing the problem.

                    <span>I use Emacs-27.1.glibc2.16-x86_64.AppImage on AV Linux MX Edition (uname -a yields: Linux 
 5.9.1-rt20avl1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_RT Sat Oct 31 12:21:58 EDT 2020 x86_64 GNU/Linux). I tried to install some favourite packages like evil, but I cannot seem to download from Melpa. I put
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) 
 ​
 in ~/.emacs, reloaded it and I get Failed to download &#x27;melpa&#x27; archive.
 I also tried
 (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority &quot;NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3&quot;) 
 ​
 as the first line in .emacs, did m-x package-initialize and m-x package-refresh-contents, still the same error.
 Any help is much appreciated.

                    <span>I really like helm&#x27;s fuzzy search for commands and buffers, but I cannot get it to work for files. Since this is such a well-known package, I assume the fault lies with me. Hopefully someone here knows what I am doing wrong.
 The situation: I am in my home directory. I want to add a note to the file ~/work/notes/todo.org.
 What I currently do: I enter &quot;wo C-j not C-j do &quot;, which is basically bash-style completion with C-j instead of the tab key and does not feel very helm-y.
 What the internet tells me to do: I have seen multiple posts of users claiming that I should be able to do this the helm way, e.g. entering &quot;todo&quot; first, then remembering the folder and narrowing with &quot;work&quot;. However, this does not work for me. Even if I remove all my custom init settings, helm-find-files just doesn&#x27;t do that.
 So what am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I need to enable?
 Other things I am aware of: I know there is also helm-find, but that a) is not fuzzy and b) takes upwards of 60 seconds (!) to find a file in my home directory even if I enter the complete file name, which is clearly not acceptable.There is also helm-projects-find-files, which seems to be for individual software projects and wants me to set up a project tree.
 I am aware that without some form of indexing, finding a file by name might just not be feasible. In that case, it would suffice if I could look for &quot;notes&quot;, find nothing, then add a space and &quot;work&quot; and helm would be smart enough to expand those directories in reverse order. It feels like that is what the helm project page advertises anyway, but it just doesn&#x27;t happen when I try it.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Many IDE has so called &quot;project explorer&quot; which display the outline of the project, some of them also give you the symbols in each file so that you can have a overview of what each file does.
 I notice there is treemacs and lsp-treemacs which provide above mentioned functionality, but I&#x27;m not sure whether this is the traditional way of Emacs to grasp the outline of a new project.

                    <span>When I want to open a file, navigating a file system is probably the slowest. What usually works is looking in recently accessed files, be it recentf or just searching mini-buffer history.
 Finding file in a project usually works the best (Projectile), but it would probably work even better if it could just search the entire system.
 If I&#x27;m certain I have had this file open this session and haven&#x27;t killed it yet, I can try switching between buffers (C-x b), but that usually only works on short trips and is rarely ergonomic.
 So if I&#x27;m not sure if the buffer is still alive, and if what I&#x27;m looking it belongs in the same project as what I&#x27;m looking for. recentf and history don&#x27;t really land themselves well to exploratory navigation. 
 What we&#x27;re left with is find-file which looks and works amazingly with ivy, counsel, or even ido. But I often find myself frustrated, when changing a buffer takes more effort than you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be necessary.
 Then I end up wishing I&#x27;d have mixed results, including recent files, input history, maybe project files, and so you could switch between them. ivy has different actions and that&#x27;s cool, but can it change the data source on the fly?

 data (,) a b &#x3D; (,) a b 
 At first sight, it seems circular. But then it works
 λ&gt; (,) 1 2 (1,2) 
 I found this, but then I don&#x27;t follow how Solo is/becomes (,). I understand that (,) is a product type since it&#x27;s definitely not a sum type of any sort. Can someone point me to some details on the whole product type theory, as well as how the (,) data type definition results in the two arguments being surrounded in parens and separated by a comma, and treated as a tuple.

                    <span>In my old neovim config, I used this line:
 autocmd FileType c nmap   :sv terminal bash -c &quot;gcc -o %:r % -lncurses &amp;&amp; ./%:r &amp;&amp; rm %:r&quot;
 To compile and run C files quickly, it first splits the current buffer and open a new terminal buffer in the new one where it compiles the file name and run the binary, after that it deletes the binary file from the directory.
 How can I make Emacs do something similar? I used &#x60;quickrun&#x60; package before, but opening a new shell window usually destroys my other windows organization, I&#x27;d like to use something like my vim workflow.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for maybe six months now on both my Windows and Linux machines for all my programming, word processing, and personal organization. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my productivity, and the community is great! Tons of tutorials, terrific documentation on almost all the packages I need, and just generally cool, helpful folks. I&#x27;ve followed the community&#x27;s advice on a whole lot of matters, including keybindings: I read people saying that CUA bindings would interfere with the bindings of many Emacs packages, that made sense to me, so I&#x27;ve learned and ingrained Emacs bindings into my brain. It&#x27;s great! Until those terrible, dark times when...I need to leave Emacs.
 And discover that Emacs has trashed my muscle memory.
 Whenever I&#x27;m in a browser (can&#x27;t use EWW for everything...right??), I find myself constantly closing tabs when I meant to cut text. I save files when I mean to search. If I use another app for long enough, I eventually do adapt back to CUA, but if I&#x27;m rapidly switching back-and-forth between Emacs and anything else, I start making mistakes the moment I relax into autopilot.
 How do y&#x27;all handle this? Do you extend Emacs bindings out to the rest of your system (and does that work across platforms)? Do you suck it up and tread carefully outside Emacs? What do you do when you face an app that can&#x27;t be easily brought into the Emacs ecosystem?

                    <span>I have often been in the position of giving advice to a novice programmer on what text editor to adopt for their day-to-day programming. Needless to say, I always recommend Emacs.
 I estimate that I have given such recommendation to 30-40 people over the years.
 AFAIK, my success rate so far is 0.00%. 1
 I would like to improve this abysmal success rate.2
 Hence I would like to ask those of you who resisted adopting Emacs at first, but ultimately did so, what took you so long? What were the barriers?
 And to those who have a better success rate than 0.00% at getting others to adopt Emacs, what is your secret?
 1 What is even more bewildering, some of these programmers, who ended up choosing a different editor, have later told me that they wished that they could do with their editors the things that I can do with Emacs. (To hear them say such things one would think that they had had to settle for a less powerful editor, because Emacs had not been an option for them, somehow.)
 2 My motivation here is not mere proselitism. Some of the people in question are actually co-workers, and I just want them to be more productive. It pains me to see how unproductive they are on account of the editors they use.

                    <span>this has been driving a bit insane, when running emacs28+ pgtk with native-comp on wayland/sway I am getting a 80%/100% CPU usage when using emacs with the good-scroll package. When I stat emacs with no buffer open it already is as high as 70% on a CPU.
 After a lot of trial and errors from my config, I pinpointed to the good-scroll package which seems to behave weirdly on wayland or maybe it&#x27;s on pgtk or native-comp, i am not so sure. It does not show up when running on Xorg.
 just to make sure I am not insane I have made a video :

                    <span>I&#x27;ve long been a bit jealous of Mac users with the Choosy application that prompts the user for which browser they&#x27;d like to use every time they open a link. The only open source Linux alternative I&#x27;ve found is Braus, but I struggled to get it working. So, I let the matter drop - it wasn&#x27;t important enough to me at the time. 
 However, it&#x27;s starting to feel a bit more necessary in Emacs (for me). My entire life is in org files - both personal and professional. I tend to use separate browsers for work and personal use, so I&#x27;d love if anyone has clever solutions for this every time I open a link in Emacs. I should add, there are also times when I just want to use eww if I&#x27;m just looking up some documentation or static content. 
 I&#x27;m guessing I could either create some bindings for each browser function or I could manipulate the browser function to actually run a custom elisp function that opens a prompt. I&#x27;m just a bit curious if anyone else has felt the same way and if you have any insights you might be willing to share.

 error 
 It happens in: C-x C-f open file,C-x b change buffer. now i cant open any file
 how it happens: i added these lines in init.el to open shell in current window, then i do M-x shell in emacs and it shows this error. To remove this error, i commented these lines, but the error still shows.
 here is the code: 
 (customize-set-variable

 &#x27;(&quot;\*shell\*&quot; (display-buffer-same-window)))

                    <span>This ‏‏‎ is probably kinda off topic for this sub, but I&#x27;m encountering a really little minimal issue I want to report, but I don&#x27;t know how. If I try to file an issue on the emacs-helm github, I get this: An owner of this repository has limited the ability to open an issue to users that are collaborators on this repository. So how do I file issues? The issue might not even be with helm. The issue is when I run helm-make-projectile, it doesn&#x27;t register targets as targets if they are followed by a &#x27;\&#x27; character. Not a huge deal. Just wanted to make it known. Just don&#x27;t know how.

                    <span>Please bear with me, I&#x27;m only starting to learn haskell. (Note: My machine is a M1 Macbook Air)
 Recently, after following a guide and installing haskell and necessary stuff from here, I tried to compile a small program and found out that I needed to install LLVM, I did it and by trial-and-error I managed to get everything working, but though it works, if I run GHCi I get this message.

One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. 
 *edit: just after posting this, when I launched GHCi again, this didn&#x27;t happen, but yesterday at first this took place, then it didn&#x27;t and today it did again
 Do you know what&#x27;s responsible for it? What should I do?

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been finally released: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0. The release is identical to rc2, circulated earlier.
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 This work would not be complete without a blazingly-fast UTF-8 validator, submitted by Koz Ross into bytestring-0.11.2.0, whose contributions were sourced via HF as an in-kind donation from MLabs. I would like to thank Emily Pillmore for encouraging me to take on this project, helping with the proposal and permissions. I&#x27;m grateful to my fellow text maintainers, who&#x27;ve been carefully reviewing my work in course of the last six months, as well as helpful and responsive maintainers of downstream packages and GHC developers. Thanks all, it was a pleasant journey!

                    <span>I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the way parallel list comprehensions are desugared, so I filed a ticket suggesting an alternative approach. It wasn&#x27;t very warmly received, unfortunately. So I thought about it a little more, and realized that the desugaring is totally broken in some cases.

                    <span>When providing a type to users, a library can also provide lenses for that type without actually depending on lens. This is because Lens is a type synonym, so you can simply write a function with the correct signature and export it, to be used like a Lens. And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.
 This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don&#x27;t explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?

                    <span>TL;DR: Game made with apecs and gloss crashes when trying to read input from Nintendo Switch.
 Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.
 As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I&#x27;m reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I&#x27;m doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).
 stepGame :: Float -&gt; C.System&#x27; () stepGame dT &#x3D; do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... 
 Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.
 Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hi all, First time experience running Haskell, I wanted to spend some time learning the fundamentals during these holidays break. 
 I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an &#x27;hello world&#x27; project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I&#x27;ll go with the flow). 
 The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I&#x27;m running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).
 Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn&#x27;t notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?

                    <span>I&#x27;m having a bit of a tough time getting my heads to insert a global property. I tried this at the top of my buffer:
 #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work when I try below on a heading:
 (org-entry-get (point) &quot;NDisks_ALL&quot;)
 What&#x27;s missing?

                    <span>Scala Native 0.4.3-SNAPSHOT was released to Sonatype snapshots and it adds Scala 3 support for Scala Native. 
 The release is binary compatible with previous ones, but Scala 3 on its own does not fully source compatible - more info about that in https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/pull/2480
 The full release is planned for the first weeks of January.

                    <span>A lot has been said already about dark vs. light. For the most part, I think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference. However, I was wondering more of folks who prefer low-contrast dark themes and find them easier on the eyes. 
 I use a slightly modified version of the [[https://depp.brause.cc/gotham-theme/][Gotham theme]]. I want to list a couple of the advantages, in order of importance to me: 
  
The low contrast is easier on my eyes, especially in low-light settings which I prefer to work most of the day. The cyan color of the text is about the right contrast against the black; full white on black feels like the light is &quot;drilling&quot; into my eyeballs, with a bit of a haze effect the more I read. On the other hand, white background with black letters is too bright, usually s…</span>

                    <span>I have it in my settings to use org-ids when storing links interactively and have org-id-link-to-org-use-id set to create-if-interactive. 
 This works great in all my files except the notes file that I have set up for org-ref. For whatever reason, capturing links using C-c l only captures the heading and the custom_id like so: file:~/path/to/org/file.org::#Custom_ID]] 
 If there are multiple types of identifiers in a header such as both a custom id and an org-id, how can I get it to choose the org-id, or at least get it to choose all the possible options so i can choose which one to use?

                    <span>Hi! :)
 I have updated my package, dtache, to version 0.2 today. In short the major improvements compared to 0.1 are:
  
Support for macOS users
 A single completion interface with support for (improved) annotations, out of the box
 The dtache-env is optional and not required for the package to work
 Better error handling
  
I made a short video going through the changes as well as showing how to use the package. The video can be seen as a continuation on the previous video about the package: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;De5oXdnY5hY
 The package can be found at: https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

                    <span>Today, in talking with a fellow developer they shared that they had recently switched from Atom to VS Code. I shared my departure from Atom and trying Vim, VS Code, and finally settling on Emacs.
 I shared Magit, Embark + WGrep, Hydra menus, Hammerspoon&#x27;s editWithEmacs, and finally some functions I&#x27;ve written to help automate common tasks in writing pull requests (conformant to our company&#x27;s Github PR template).
 I explained that while VS Code might be an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), I find Emacs to be an Integrated Computering Environment (ICE).
 I&#x27;m finding the more I use Emacs, the more I think about how I interact with files and text. I didn&#x27;t convert anyone from VS Code to Emacs, but then again were I &quot;only writing software&quot; I probably would be using VS Code.

                    <span>I’ve been using DOOM Emacs for about six months since ditching VSCode and I love it, even though I probably have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t quite understand how to debug the Elixir LSP features (I’m mostly an elixir dev) and I don’t really know elisp to this point. I’m probably doing a bunch of awful shit and not realizing how much I could make my life easier. Plug-ins are weird, the docs confuse me. I want to learn emacs for real, and the idea of hand-rolling a vanilla config is kind of overwhelming and crazy to me. How can I dive into the world of emacs in little, manageable doses without biting off way more than I can chew or getting in over my head so far I just walk away?

                    <span>Hello. Over the last couple of weeks I asked 2 questions on this sub and both the times I was asked which book I was reading and also that it may be outdated. 
 Q1
 Q2
 http://learnyouahaskell.com/ is a resource listed in the sidebar of this sub. Is this book really outdated? If so what other similar book would you recommend? I come from a mobile development background (Swift) and for whatever reason, the format of this book makes it very approachable for me.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using org-roam for taking most of my notes and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I heavily rely on tags to organize the notes and a feature that I wasn&#x27;t able to find in org-roam is the possibility to have a list of all the tags I created, so that I can select a tag from this list and obtain a list of files with that tag. I know I can use org-roam-node-find, type the name of a tag and filter the files with that tag. However, given the large amount of tags I&#x27;m using, it&#x27;s very hard to memorize all of them and I don&#x27;t always know the exact name of the tag I&#x27;m looking for. Therefore, having a complete list with all the tags would be very helpful for me. Do you know if there&#x27;s a way of having this feature in org-roam?

                    <span>I have an org file that has content like below:
  
:PROPERTIES:
 :ID: 6dc9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e
 :END:
 #+title: example 
 * Header
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Here the file filename is in the folder that is named based on the ID value: .attach/6d/c9fdfe-d24a-4eaf-8152-1f663ba70a2e, and I can link to the file without any issue.
 After I run org-id-get-create for * Header, I had a new ID added for the header, and it becomes something like below
  
* Header
 :PROPERTIES:
 :ID: cd858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0
 :END:
 [[attachment:filename]]
  
Now the attachment link to the file filename does not work any more, I have to move the file to a new folder for the new ID created, i.e., .attach/cd/858afc-45ca-4f3d-bde8-a6f68c8acad0.
 This is annoying and I just wonder if there is a way to let the header * Header to search attachment in its parent&#x27;s attachment folder as well? I tried to set org-attach-use-inheritance or set org-use-property-inheritance to t, but neither works.

                    <span>Dear friends,
I&#x27;m releasing phi-notes, an emacs package implementing a minor mode to work with a flavour of the Zettelkasten system I&#x27;ve been using for some years now.  It has the following characteristics:
Notes are identified by unique, sequential numbers (0001, 0002 etc.).
Notes may be linked using the wikilink syntax ([[0001]]).
Notes may have &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;descendant&quot; notes; they may also be linked to project notes.
Bibliographical annotation is supported with BibTeX references.
Notes may have tags (identified by #hashtags).
Notes have a YAML(ish) frontmatter to keep metadata and are (preferably, but not necessarily) written in Markdown.
The aim of this project is to develop features to ease the creation, navigation and linking of notes in one or multiple note repositories.
A sidebar functionality makes the minor-mode particularly useful for working with structure notes:

Other functionalities include: creating descendant notes, integration with helm, helm-ag and helm-bibtex; &quot;killing&quot; and &quot;yanking&quot; to notes, searching for tags and backlinks; navigation commands for visiting the parent, following links.
Some details of the implementation might be too personal, but the code may at least be useful as a starting point. I&#x27;m calling it a phi minor mode because this is how I named my system long ago.
More information and a setup guide are available on the GitHub project documentation.

                    <span>Hi
 I&#x27;ve just set up emacs on a new machine using a configuration file that I am using already without any particular issues. 
 On the new box, every time I start up emacs, there is always the request to define the &quot;fridge indicator&quot; and it presents me 2 options:
 &quot;Always&quot;
 &quot;Only When Focused&quot;
 Once I pick up one choice the buffer get closed but it is quite annoying.
 What could be the cause of it?
 Regards

                    <span>How would I modify the default org-roam capture template so that it stuffs %x or %L into a :ROAM_REFS: property in the file&#x27;s property drawer?
 All I can find are examples of inserting data into heading property drawers, but that&#x27;s not where org-roam-ref-add inserts them.

                    <span>I am trying to combine the package better-jumper into consult so I can browse my jump points with consults nice preview and search functionality. I have tried to use the existing consult commands as a template and have come up with the following code:
 (defun consult-better-jumper () (interactive) (consult--read (better-jumper--get-jump-list) :prompt &quot;Jump to: &quot; :annotate (consult--line-prefix) :category &#x27;consult-location :sort nil :require-match t :lookup #&#x27;consult--lookup-location :history &#x27;(:input consult--line-history) :add-history (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol) :state (consult--jump-state))) 
 When I run this with M-x consult-better-jumper I get the following error:
 cl--assertion-failed: Assertion failed: (or (functionp candidates) (obarrayp candidates) (hash-table-p candidates) (not candidates) (stringp (car candidates)) (and (consp (car candidates)) (stringp (caar candidates))) (and (consp (car candidates)) (symbolp (caar candidates)))) 
 Upon investigation this error clearly comes from consult--read
 I guess my question boils down to how I can turn the list returned from &#x60;better-jumper--get-jump-list) into a data structure that consult can understand?

 What I want to do is be able to comment a line of code with my cursor being anywhere on that line. Is this possible?
 Thank you.

                    <span>DISCLAIMER! Im not the author of Dirvish. I did a search for Dirvish in this SubReddit and nothing showed up. Not sure where else I&#x27;ve found it. I guess probably from sachachua.com blog if not from here.
  
This package empowers dired by giving it a modern UI in a unintrusive way. Emacs users deserve a file manager better than those popular ones on terminal such as ranger, vifm, lf since Emacs is not limited to a terminal.
 dirvish-minibuffer-preview.el is an extension for dirvish, it provides dirvish-minibuf-preview-mode, which is a feature to preview file when narrowing file/directory candidates using minibuffer.
 In dirvish, you can mark files across multiple dirvish buffers, and paste/move marked files/directory to current directory with one keystroke (dirvish-yank).
 The name dirvish is a tribute to vim-dirvish.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 (my question is not 100% emacs related, posting it here cause there are lots of programmable keyboard users on the sub and discussion might be useful)
 I am new to keyboard layouts, could you help me with the following?
  
Layer toggles vs combos
  
Let say i want to have navigation on ijkl,
 I could toggle on / off navigation layer when modifier button is pressed
 or i can make combos: modifier+i &#x3D; up, modifier+j &#x3D; left, etc.
 Which approach is better and when each of them should be used?
 With first you have to be mentally aware about current “modes” you are in, with second you have to keep modifier button pressed.
  
Modifiers vs different keys to express degree of action.
  
Let say i have following 3 actions: (emacs related)
 delete char
 delete word
 delete line 
 I could make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier1 + w, Modifier1 + e
 Or i can make them
 Modifier1 + d, Modifier2 + d, Modifier3 + d
 Which approach is better / more logical? How would you do it and why?
  
What writer/programmer friendly layouts you can recommend for inspiration? (40% or 60%, not bigger). I am not interested to learn about letter layouts (qwerty, dvorak, etc) but more about positions / layering of universal keys (delete, backspace, enter, navigation, numbers, etc) I saw miryoku layout, is there smng else to learn from?
 
Are there other resources you can recommend related to above? 
 
 p.s. I have all modifiers under thumbs

                    <span>Looking for inspirations.
 I wonder how many people are still using ledger for their personal finance given there are a lot of online services with good phone apps.
 One of my goals in 2022 is to keep my finance in a good shape. I previously used ledger and org-capture to log transactions and reporting. but it&#x27;s a lot of work given the number of transactions per week. this is one of the reasons i give up. If i continue to use emacs/ledger, i need to simplify the workflow, maybe import from CSV and convert to ledger once a week/month or something. 
 ​
 another reason I gave up is that i have joint accounts, using emacs/ledger makes it harder to share.
 ​
 any comments on how you use Emacs or not use Emacs for personal finance would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>I used to like the recursive subdirectory search and autocomplete feature of ido-mode. For example if I have a file ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and I type C-x C-f ~/foo/qux, ido-mode automatically searches ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt and autocompletes it in the find-file minibuffer.
 But when I do the same thing with fido-mode, nothing happens. In fido-mode, I am required to type the complete path like C-x C-f ~/foo/bar/baz/qux and only then it autocompletes the path to ~/foo/bar/baz/qux.txt.
 It seems that ido-mode can search for filename matches recursively in subdirectories. How can I get the same result in fido-mode?

                    <span>Hello!
 When folding in org-mode, if I&#x27;m not on a heading, I use outline-up-heading to move to the parent heading of the content and fold the heading using org-cycle. However, in doing so, the cursor becomes trapped in the invisible region of the heading&#x27;s content, as shown by invisible-p (point), in such a way that, if I quickly change my mind and want to unfold the heading again, I can&#x27;t just org-cycle again; I have to manually move the cursor into a visible region of the header, like the beginning of the line, then org-cycle to unfold.
 So basically my question is: How do I move the cursor to a visible region after folding a heading, and not get stuck in an invisible region, and be forced to move the cursor manually?
 Thank you kindly for the help!
  
UPDATE: I&#x27;ve solved this using (while (invisible-p (point)) (backward-char)), but it seems a tad inefficient; is there a better way to do this?

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2021-12/msg00463.html
 Lot&#x27;s of interest, judging from the epic threads that have ensued since then.
 There aren&#x27;t many programming languages or systems where you can just assume the existence of a built-in relational database. The IBM AS/400 was one such system from the 80s. Emacs could become one if the SQLite plan is executed.
 Looking forward to org-mode tables that are backed and fed from RDBMS tables.

                    <span>Has anyone ever overused monads and created bugs because of using them in an imperative style? If so, how did you get past that stage of your learning process? How can I try to use Monads more safely? This problem arose especially because of my use of the State monad.
 I feel like I went full circle with my FP understanding: Noob -&gt; Understands some -&gt; Understands Monads and has mind blown -&gt; Uses them -&gt; Blows up in face -&gt; is now scared -&gt; Noob

                    <span>hey everyone, I’m new here so idk if this has already been addressed in earlier posts but I’m a comp sci minor and I’m taking Haskell in the spring. I’ve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but I’ve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. I’m taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a &#x3D; Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’ 
 My guess is that that&#x27;s due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m &#x3D;&gt; Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn&#x27;t always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Monad (Free f) where return &#x3D; Var (Var x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; g x (Node x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; Node $ (fmap.(flip (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

                    <span>I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here&#x27;s the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (&gt;&#x3D; myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I&#x27;m having some trouble. Obviously, I can&#x27;t use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num &#x3D; [mod x 256 | x &lt;- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l &#x3D; truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms &#x3D; [syms !! y | y &lt;- nums]
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don&#x27;t know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

                    <span>Renovate is used widely to help manage dependencies. Since this week was a short week for us at Caribou, two of us spent some time starting the work to add Haskell support https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/13224. It needs help.
 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don&#x27;t have to duplicate their work.
 There&#x27;s another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we&#x27;d all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you&#x27;d like to help but don&#x27;t like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

                    <span>I’m little confused by these words, we can have a type A, which can be created by using sealed trait or use the types provided by scala type system like String ‘ Any , and unit and others. We can represent a list of numbers using List(1,2,3). So is list a kind ? Or is list a type constructor ?. we are not constructing any new type here using type constructor which is list or may be I really need to see from differ perspectives inorder to understand it. And moreover what is a higher kind Vs Kind. I’m learning advanced scala to understand how types and type level programming works . Please help me out understanding these words /vocabulary ? Thank you

I wrote a small to medium-sized series on using the Zettelkasten to deal with fiction (both analysation and creating). To make the series more whole, I thought to give you the chance to ask any questions you have. I will publish the answers as the last installment of the series.
So, what are your questions?

                    <span>What are your favorite bits of advice?
 I just came across this one (from here) and I wonder how I ever did without it.
 (defadvice kill-line (before kill-line-autoreindent activate) &quot;Kill excess whitespace when joining lines. If the next line is joined to the current line, kill the extra indent whitespace in front of the next line.&quot; (when (and (eolp) (not (bolp))) (save-excursion (forward-char 1) (just-one-space 1)))) 
 Another great one that springs to mind is Radian&#x27;s find-file advice that automatically creates and deletes parent directories of new files.

                    <span>I wanted to enable some modes when working with yaml files and added this to my .emacs file:

 When opening a yaml file these modes are not enabled and all I get is the following message: 
 File mode specification error: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil) 
 Can someone help me?

                    <span>Hello!
 Basically what the title says; how can I, for example, highlight a region with, say, shift-selection, and then use something like TAB on it to indent it? Or anything like that, really.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

 ​
 Before cutting the next release would be great to have more feedbacks on rough edges. I&#x27;m not a bitbucket user myself, then hard to spot details.
 ​
 Happy holiday season everyone!

 I might not answer today, as it&#x27;s quite late for me now.

Is there any library/research to help with this?
 What would be the easiest approach?

                    <span>Over the pandemic (and for one training session before it started), we have used a different set of materials for the Haskell 101 and Haskell 102 classes at Google. Although Haskell is not an officially supported language, this material was still presented to over 200 participants.
 The materials are available at https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings and any feedback is much appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn how to use some ghc extensions with a simple multiplayer terminal based RPG and i would like to ask about creative ways to use extensions like TypeFamilies, KindSignatures, GADTs, DataKinds or TypeClasses to make some mechanic of RPG (like if an item is tradable so i can use functions that are related to selling and trading). 
 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it&#x27;s a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

                    <span>Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell newtype Username &#x3D; Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError &#x3D; ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -&gt; Either LoginError Username newUsername name &#x3D; ... -- inspects argument and might return Left &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with &quot;&quot; results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

                    <span>Initially i was suggested to write haskell code in Latex by Minted Package. But when i am compiling this code
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;\documentclass[12pt]{article}
 \usepackage{minted} \begin{document} \begin{minted}{haskell} --type Stack a &#x3D; [a] --push :: Stack a -&gt; a -&gt; Stack a --push xs x &#x3D; x:xs
 --pop :: Stack a -&gt; (a, Stack a) --pop [] &#x3D; error &quot;Empty List&quot; --pop (x:xs) &#x3D; (x, xs)
 data Stack a &#x3D; Stack [a] instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; Show (Stack a) where show (Stack [a]) &#x3D; show [a]
 push :: Stack a -&gt; a -&gt; Stack a push (Stack xs) x &#x3D; Stack (x:xs)
 pop :: Stack a -&gt; (a,Stack a) pop (Stack xs) | null xs &#x3D; error &quot;Empty List&quot; | otherwise &#x3D; (head xs, Stack xs)
 \end{minted} \end{document} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It was showing the error
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; line 3: Package minted Error: You must invoke LaTeX with the -shell-escape flag. \begin
 line 3: Emergency stop. \begin{document}
  : shell escape is disabled, so I can only detect \ifwindows. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Why it is happening and how to overcome it ?

                    <span>In my continued attempt to get mstksg&#x27;s AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it&#x27;s not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The &quot;Interactive&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn&#x27;t think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I&#x27;m missing something simple and obvious here? - The &quot;Executable&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I&#x27;m using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day&#x27;s solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

                    <span>I work in a small SW company merging with a bigger services company in the financial services industry in the EU. The new company uses Scala and many of its libraries including cats http4s fs2 affects and doobi amongst others. FP is known to us, but the scala stack looks to be super intimidating. How much should we expect to be ramping up until we get back to being productive? The code doesn&#x27;t look like any code we&#x27;ve ever seen and we thought we had seen a lot. Concerned that my team would lose motivation and leave. Grateful for your consideration !

But now I am curious : how do I create that top bar with the contents? Is it just a normal org mode table? Another question: can you resize text in emacs to export to html?

                    <span>I have a master branch in my GIT repository, checked out in the local working directory master, and a downstream myproject branch checked out in myproject. These are routinely synchronized via automatically-generated poll requests. Within each there is a source/shared, source/common-services, and source/projects. Only within the myproject repository there is a subdirectory source/projects/myproject.
 Problem Statement: I want to edit the common code only within the master branch. How can I have Emacs default to read-only mode when opening files from myproject/source/shared and myproject/source/common-applications, but not from myproject/projects/myproject?
 FWIW, I am using treemacs and would love to find/create some sort of hook within that context.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and trying to find the correct location to add a template to my org capture templates which are set in org-capture-templates. 
 Currently I&#x27;ve added the following lines to config.el but I it seems the list is not created yet when I try to add to it:
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-capture-templates &#x27;(&quot;d&quot; &quot;Custom Task&quot; entry (file+headline +org-capture-project-custom-file &quot;Inbox&quot;) &quot;* TODO %?&quot; :empty-lines 1)) 
 The exact error is: Error in private config: config.el, (void-variable org-capture-templates)
 What is the correct location (or callback?) to add config to that variable?

Is this possible to do with a simple command without resorting to writing my own implementation (something like &#x60;:%s/\%u00a0/ /g&#x60; in vim). So far i have tried &#x60;replace-string&#x60;, &#x60;replace-regexp&#x60; and &#x60;query-replace&#x60;. Any attempt says that there were 0 occurrences.

                    <span>Hello,
 I recently replaced my ssh-agent by gnupg (https://opensource.com/article/19/4/gpg-subkeys-ssh). This works fine outside of emacs (I can ssh server and it uses the gpg key). This part (replacing ssh-agent with gpg) especially does not work inside emacs, other parts (decrypting a file with gpg) work fine.
 This is all from withing emacs -nw -Q. This is all in the terminal, emacs not graphical.
 I am able to use emacs to edit an ecrypted .gpg file from within emacs, it asks for the password in the minibuffer and I can enter it: https://i.imgur.com/SON3tM6.png
 However I also use my gpg keys to access other computers through ssh (enable-ssh-support in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf), and it seems emacs can&#x27;t handle it well. The prompt in this case is broken and it doesn&#x27;t detect my keystroke…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a mode for reverse engineering, specifically a mode for viewing executables; because I dislike the slowness of Ghidra; IDA pro is paid and I dislike paid software; and there seems to be no reverse engineering tools for emacs.
 I have been getting familiar with emacs lisp (for ~3 days); I am even thinking about trying out common lisp. However I do not have a design in mind for a reverse engineering mode, which is what I am trying to figure out.
 What would be the mode layout? How would I display program information?

                    <span>I want to learn C and I need an IDE. Since we don&#x27;t have nice IDEs like Visual Studio on Linux and using Vim(the editor I usually use) as an IDE looks like a really stupid idea since bloating it with a bunch of plugins will make it slow and unpleasant to use, I am turning to Emacs which is more than a text editor(how much more I don&#x27;t know, I just know it isn&#x27;t just a text editor) and you can bloat it with plugins without really slowing it down much. I chose DOOM Emacs because I played with it half a year ago and liked the fact that it used the Vim key bindings by default, so I didn&#x27;t really have to re-learn how to edit text files, and the fact that it comes pre-configured in a nice way, saving me a lot of time.
 Anyway, what I want to ask is if I can turn Emacs into a nice C ID, and if it is possible, how do I do that. Thanks in advance.

                    <span>An opening for a Post Doctoral position on hardware acceleration of functional programming languages (specifically, Haskell), at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
 The role will involve developing a special purpose processor for Haskell, aimed at outperforming the throughput and energy performance of CPUs. The project is inspired by graph reduction machines like GRIN from the 1980s, and modern FPGA/ASIC protypes PilGRIM and Reduceron.
 Candidates should have a background in hardware design and FPGA programming. Hardware engineering experience should include circuit design, developing processor architectures, memory hierarchies and/or instruction sets. Candidates should have some understanding of functional programming. Programming language implementation experience is desirable, but not essential. The project has close industry ties with Xilinx in Ireland and QBayLogic in the Netherlands.
 It is a three year project, starting in May 2022.
 The HAFLANG project:
 https://haflang.github.io
 Job details and application form:
 https://enzj.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX/job/1716/
 The application deadline is 28th February 2022.
 Contact the project&#x27;s Principle Investigator, Rob Stewart ([R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk](mailto:R.Stewart@hw.ac.uk)), with inquiries.

                    <span>Asking this for u/Lucky-Lambda since he is a new user and has been waiting for days for moderators to approve his post:
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; QUOTE START &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
 I am trying to test a Stack project that contains an exe, lib, and tests. We have tests for lib now (with lib listed under test &#x60;dependencies:&#x60;), and exe depends on lib in the same way, but there is an aspect of the exe I&#x27;d like to test.
 I have tried to use &#x60;verbatim&#x60; in my package.yaml to get hpack to pass along &#x60;build-tool-depends&#x60;:, which should allow me to reference a &#x60;project:executable&#x60;. I do see it does include it at the bottom of that &#x60;test-suite&#x60; in the generated Cabal output, but I still get a &#x60;Could not find module&#x60; in the test file itself (what I am importing there is listed in the &#x60;executable&#x60; section &#x60;other-modules:&#x60;) when running &#x60;stack test&#x60;.
 I have also tried referencing the exe in the new test with &#x60;build-tools:&#x60;. It makes it into the cabal file, but without the project name prefix I originally included, and does not seem to help either.
 Any possible things I am missing or should try instead? It generates a cabal file with what I thought should work, but it does not seem to be exposing the module I am trying to import from exe in the test. Thanks so much! 
 Versions: * Stack resolver: lts-18.15 * Cabal: Cabal-3.2.1.0 * Running on a M1 Mac 12.1 in a Rosetta terminal (should not be ARM related, as it builds/tests just fine without the above attempt, just giving for context)
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; QUOTE END &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
 Remark from me (u/Martinsos): We also read that one solution is to move all the exe code to the lib and then exe just becomes an extremely thin wrapper. However, I love having this separation between exe and lib, on one hand to make sure that lib doesn&#x27;t in any way depend on exe, and also because external/hackage dependencies are nicely separated, so I would rather avoid that if there is a nicer way to do it.

                    <span>&quot;To join Num, a type must already be friends with Show and Eq.&quot;
 There wasn&#x27;t a followup given to this statement in the book I am reading and I am trying to wrap my head around it. It is easy to follow how a Num must be Eq, but why does it also have to be a Show. If anything I would imagine conforming to Read would be required. 
 So when you do 5 * (6::Double), internally do a read as Double for 5. 
 Is it that compiler does (read (show 5)::Double) * (6::Double)?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m learning Scala for work, and I like it, I am however trying to work out what the worksheets are for. I&#x27;m using IntelliJ, and it keeps taking the cursor focus off every few seconds while it evaluates what has been written. What are Worksheets actually used for? Is there a good use case that will make studies easier, or is it something that is not worth spending time on depending on IDE being used?

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m trying to write a function that decides if a value is compile time known:
 import scala.quoted._ def toOptionImpl[T](using Quotes, FromExpr[T], Type[T])(expr: Expr[T]): Expr[Option[T]] &#x3D; if expr.value.isDefined then &#x27;{Some($expr)} else &#x27;{None} inline def toOption[T](inline expr: T) &#x3D; ${ toOptionImpl(&#x27;expr) } 
 toOptionImpl with toOption commented out compiles, otherwise:
 [error] 80 | inline def toOption[T](inline expr: T) &#x3D; ${ toOptionImpl(&#x27;expr) } [error] | ^ [error] |ambiguous implicit arguments: both object StringContextFromExpr in object FromExpr and given instance IntFromExpr in object FromExpr match type quoted.FromExpr[T] of parameter x$2 of method toOptionImpl 
 The same functions specialised to e.g. Int work. How to fix it? Thanks in advance :)

                    <span>A couple of weeks ago Nix 2.4 was
released. This
was the first release in more than two years. More than 195
individuals contributed to this release. Since Tweag is the biggest
contributor to the Nix project, I’d like to highlight some of the
features that Tweag has worked on.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.
You can read more about flakes in the following blog posts:
Nix Flakes, Part 1: An introduction and tutorial
Nix Flakes, Part 2: Evaluation caching

                    <span>Hi,
how do you handle famous quotes?
Do you rewrite them in you own words or do keep the original words?
How do you organise them?
Are they part of the content of a zettel/idea?
Or do you create a separate zettel for each quote?
Or do you collect quotes by author (or topic) on a (big) zettel?
What is your way?</span>

                    <span>Hi @ctietze! Thanks for the update to 1.7.5. However, when I installed it, the font for the display became much larger and I am unable to control the font size via the preferences, the menu bar, or keyboard shortcuts. I even tried changing fonts.
I have since rolled back to the last version for which I had a DMG file (1.6.3), so I couldn&#x27;t check if this occurs with a 1.7.x version.
I am on running Mac OS 12.0.1.
Can you or anyone else reproduce this issue?

                    <span>If you don&#x27;t use pcre or some other package then you may find emacs&#x27; own regexps are clumsy when doing interactive regexp replace, because you have to escape some of the most frequent constructs like \(...\) and \|.
 This snippet reverses the semantics for these when using M-x query-replace-regexp, so that you can simply type ( ) for capture and | for alternation and use \( etc. for matching an actual paren which is needed less often:
 (defun my-perform-replace (origfun &amp;rest args) (apply origfun (if (eq this-command &#x27;query-replace-regexp) ;; do conversion only for regexp replace (cons (let ((s (car args)) (placeholder (format &quot;@placeholder%s@&quot; (int-to-string (buffer-modified-tick))))) (dolist (char &#x27;(&quot;|&quot; &quot;(&quot; &quot;)&quot;)) (setq s (replace-regexp-in-string placeholder char (replace-regexp-in-string char (concat &quot;\\\\&quot; char) (replace-regexp-in-string (concat &quot;\\\\&quot; char) placeholder s))))) s) (cdr args)) args))) (advice-add &#x27;perform-replace :around &#x27;my-perform-replace)

                    <span>Hi all, 
 I use emacs mostly for academic writing. As a beginner, I thoroughly enjoy org-mode. However, for practical reasons (journal submission, co-authoring, etc.), I need to create a word document (.docx) more often than I thought. I&#x27;ve used pandoc to convert .tex to .docx, which I am more or less satisfied with. 
 I wonder if anyone has a nice workflow for academic writing, which often needs to end up with a word document. For example, if a bibliography is included, which, markdown or org-mode, gives you a better experience? Or are there other options? Any suggestion will be welcome!

                    <span>So I am interested in creating a &quot;filtered&quot; switch-to-buffer function. I was looking into the read-buffer function as its 4th argument PREDICATE mentions
  
Optional arg PREDICATE, if non-nil, is a function limiting the buffers that 
 can be considered. It will be called with each potential candidate, in 
 the form of either a string or a cons cell whose car is a string, and 
 should return non-nil to accept the candidate for completion, nil otherwise.
  
To my understanding, the predicate function needs to take one input argument which is a string or cons cell and when read-buffer is called it will pass every open buffer to the function and will only output those buffers that returned a non-nil value. At least this is what I understand from the docstring. 
 However, in practice, how exactly would you call read-buffer with this function as its 4th argument. I couldn&#x27;t find any info online about it so I was wondering if this community had any clue how it works.

                    <span>I am writing a code in Haskell, and I was wondering if we can put a where statement (pattern matching) after a return statement in a do block? I tried doing this however it seems like my code is having trouble reading comments after doing so, so I am thinking that it might be confusing the comments as being part of the do block or a similar such error?

                    <span>Hello r/hashkell !
 I&#x27;m working on a programming assignment where I&#x27;m asked to speed up a BFS type algorithm (a N-puzzle solver to be specific) with parallelism. I&#x27;ve tried using parMap to evaluate the next the potential moves and their costs in parallel. But this has only made my program slower. Is there something wrong with my approach?
 I&#x27;d also like to run the actual path finding recursion with all candidates (or the best two) at the same time but I&#x27;ve heard this isn&#x27;t really possible due to the function returning an IO(). Is there anything I can do to make this part of the program go faster?
 Ideally I want something like this:
 for each state in possible_future_states: new thread(target&#x3D;BFS, args&#x3D;variables updated with this state being chosen) 
 Thank you for reading this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 This is my current attempt

 I note that opt is definitely in the path:  % which opt /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/opt

                    <span>Hello everyone, I have been learning about ZIO over the weekend and with a lot of materials to learn, a lot more of questions came with it. To give you some context, I never professionally worked with Scala so I have a lot of assumptions which certainly aren&#x27;t applicable.
 My first question would be about Tagless Final and ZIO. Because ZIO embeds its own Error type as ZIO[R, E, A], if using ZIO as a Tagless Final, it becomes possible to abstract and hide away one layer or Errors. So I have been trying to separate System errors from Business errors in the sake of having a Domain layer curated of error handling for the System errors.
 System error would be, what I qualify as lower level and environmental errors, as network connection drop, remote service being unreachable, etc. Business erro…</span>

                    <span>I have decided to spice up my holiday coding session consisting of nigths between 22/12-07/01 by swapping VIM for Emacs, so I have a couple questions.
 Premise for the setup; I&#x27;ll start from vanilla Emacs and I aim to have a minimal set of packages enabling me to write some C/C++ with completion (lsp and/or deep stuff not necessary) and a nice (simple) way to browse project related files.
 Questions:
  
What packages do you recommend and why?
 Configuration recommendations/snippets?
 Keybindings you can&#x27;t live without?
 Suggestions on good/must reads on the topic?
  
I&#x27;ve set up a repo containing some initial configuration which you can find here: https://codeberg.org/0xedd1e/dotfiles
 So far I&#x27;ve found Emacs to be really interesting and the package management seems superb (and easy). I also want to mention that I will not install evil-mode, at least not during this period.
 Ps. Not interested in an Emacs dist, I like keeping stuff clean and understandable.

                    <span>I have an org capture that sets a scheduled (right now) as well as a deadline (some other day) an captured TODO items. Unfortunately, an my agenda there isn&#x27;t a difference for whether it&#x27;s displaying the fact that I scheduled it today, or the fact that the deadline is today. Any recommendations on this? Is there a face or a function or a customization that I&#x27;ve missed here?

                    <span>Hello there,
 I am using the vscode css-language-server binary with eglot, and it&#x27;s working great in css files, but when I open up sass files, it does not work with the current sass syntax that does not have braces or semi-colons. When I type the css-ls auto-completion does not work correctly, and syntax errors get thrown even though the syntax is correct and sass code compiles fine without any errors.
 Any tips on how to fix this issue?
 I&#x27;m guessing that sass-mode needs to get installed and configured with css-ls/eglot in use-package(my setup)?
 Thanks in advance for the help

                    <span>I am trying to make the most of the excellent modus-themes (which are rather awe-inspiring in the rigor and attention to detail that as gone into them), but the more I investigate the more I realize I don&#x27;t understand how to use themes or even the basics of how emacs handles colors and faces, much less themes.
 It started when I realized that Info-mode was presenting links with an illegibly bright cyan, which I realized was #00ffff. This is despite the fact that modus-themes supports info-mode, defines a cyan which is not that color, and I have no other theme loaded.
 So why was info-mode using the &quot;wrong&quot; cyan? Or do I need to take special steps to configure modus-themes to apply to info-mode?
 For that matter, how come I can&#x27;t see modus-theme&#x27;s cyan anywhere in the list shown by list-colors-display? And where do the other named and defined colors on that list come from?
 How do I even get the color of the character at point?
 I realize these are basic questions but I&#x27;d appreciate any pointers on how to understand this are better.

                    <span>Since some folks requested it, I&#x27;ve done the bit of housekeeping required to get gh-notify available on MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/gh-notify
 If you use Magit/Forge quite a bit, you might find it useful. TL;DR: gh-notify lets you manage your GitHub notifications in a more efficient way, especially if you routinely receive large amounts of notifications.

                    <span>We&#x27;ve been using string-interpolate to interpolate variables to build URL paths in tests, but it uses the Show instance for custom types, which doesn&#x27;t work for some of our newtypes, so I wrote a quick quasiquoter that does simple interpolation using ToHttpApiData

                    <span>So i tried to write a program with a gui and decided to use gloss to render it. But when i try to import the module, Graphics.Gloss it says it&#x27;s not found. So then i tried to cabal install gloss but it outputs the following error message:
 cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library: * Missing (or bad) C library: GL This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that provides this library (you may need the &quot;-dev&quot; version). If the library is already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags --extra-include-dirs&#x3D; and --extra-lib-dirs&#x3D; to specify where it is.If the library file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages. cabal: Failed to build OpenGLRaw-3.3.4.1 (which is required by gloss-1.13.2.1). See the build log above for details. 
 So naturally i tried to install the library with cabal, OpenGlRaw but that gave the same error message except the gloss part. I tried to find information about this library but couldn&#x27;t find anything useful for me, I am using nixos but the error appears on a secondary computer with fedora as well. I have opengl installed through my NixOS configuration and i have tried several c compilers or other openGL packages. This may not have to do with haskell but i assume i will get just as much help here as on r/NixOS 
 I am glad for anyone taking their time to help me.

                    <span>So we have this assignment where we to write a game &quot;What is left&quot; which makes an array from 1 to n and removes elements by index, first evens, then odds, then modulo 3s, example JavaScript code:
 process.stdin.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, function (data) {
 let n &#x3D; parseInt(data, 10)
 let arr &#x3D; Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) &#x3D;&gt; i + 1)
 let order &#x3D; 1
 while (arr.length !&#x3D;&#x3D; 1) {
 if (order &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1)
 arr &#x3D; arr.filter((e, i) &#x3D;&gt; i % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
 else if (order &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 2) {
 arr &#x3D; arr.filter((e, i) &#x3D;&gt; i % 2 !&#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
 } else if (order &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) {
 arr &#x3D; arr.filter((e, i) &#x3D;&gt; (i + 1) % 3 !&#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
 }
 order &#x3D; (order + 1) % 3
 }
 console.log(arr[0])
 });

 I was wondering if someone could show me an example of same code idea in Haskell?

                    <span>Hello guys! I was wondering if a physical mini keyboard exists that is suitable for using with Termux and org mode (I use doom emacs on Termux). What I have in mind is something that would look like the old school PDAs or this new Gemini PDA device. It would be great to be able to physically mount thid keyboard to the phone to mimic the clamshell form factor of a PDA and get a fully mobile emacs and org mode experience. Any thoughts are appreciated.

 I&#x27;ve put this line in my file:

 And I have citeproc-el installed. 
 I&#x27;m supposed to do something else, I know, but I can&#x27;t figure it out. 
 Thanks for any help!

                    <span>Very new to emacs world here, trying to migrate from vim. I work on windows now (unfortunatly) and so far working with spacemacs has been far easier to get up and going than trying to configure vim on windows.
 unfortunatly spacemacs does not have support for angular in their layers utility. When setting up python lsp I just added the python layer in the config file then set a hook to start lsp-mode when in python mode. 
 I found ng2-mode in this github repo and a minimal layer setup for it in another random repo here.
 I added and angular folder to the layers directory and added it into the loaded layers in .spacemacs config file. 
 ng2-mode seems to load and run just fine. But LSP never starts, I dont get an lsp-log file buffer like I do when i open a python file.

                    <span>tl;dr use Emacs to write scientific LaTeX, want good non-obtrusive grammar-checker. Anyone who use Emacs for LaTeX frequently have any experience?
 I use Emacs for writing scientific texts in LaTeX, and so a spell checker/grammar checker is obviously important. I have yet to find a solution that I am happy with, so I would like to hear if anyone has some good suggestions.
 I have earlier used flyspell, but it falls short compared to Grammarly, LanguageTool and Trinka, as it only corrects words, and has no &quot;contextual&quot; understanding.
 I have tested lsp-ltex, which worded quite well, but I found it way too intrusive. Sure, I could probably have gotten it to work if i tinkered enough, but I feel like something so essential as a spell checker should be simple. For reference, below are two other threads related to this, but I did not find the answers there satisfactory; in particular I feel like many of the solutions are made for pure programming languages, and then bodged together to work with LaTeX.

                    <span>Hi! 
 I&#x27;m a regular Emacs user, testing the version 28 for some months ago (right now in 28.0.90). 
 Looking at the git repo and the devel mailing list, I was wondering if there are criteria/policies/requirements to declare a branch stable enough to be released. 
 The nearest example is, of course, Emacs 28, but I don&#x27;t know if there are some guidelines for any future release (28.2, 29, etc). 
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Title says it. Looking for a keyboard with relatively small space bar / more space for modifiers which can be pressed with thumbs.
 On my keyboard now with left thumb i can press comfortably first closest to space bar modifier, somewhat comfortably second closest to space modifier; with right thumb even first closest to space modifier is not comfortable.
 Priorities
 - portable
 - reasonably priced
 Usage - programming / typing
 OS - windows / android
 ​
 Options i am considering:
 - JIS (japanese) layout keyboard
 - ?remapping trackpad mouse buttons on thinkpad keyboard?

I tried with some images I found on the internet and it worked, I tried to create my own using canva.com and it didn&#x27;t work (both svg). It looks like a svg problem to me, when I open and view the code of these svg&#x27;s the one I created and exported has a slightly strange ending. Do you know where there is a good place to create these images with the &quot;real svg&quot;?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to figure what is done to figure out the searched symbol name when xref-find-definitions is called.
 The problem is the following. When I&#x27;m in org mode and in elisp source code block I try to use xref-find-definitions when my cursor is located on a string &quot;;; &#x60;own-variable&#x27;&quot;. Then emacs says &quot;no definitions found for &quot;own-variable&#x27;&quot;. So it somehow falsely thinks that the final single quote is also part of a symbol name. How do I find what is being used to decide what&#x27;s the searched symbol name?
 I tried profiling, and debug-on-entry for xref-find-definitions but that seems to be too late. The symbol name is already been made.
 I have an impression that Org mode uses &quot;pcomplete-completions-at-point&quot; for this completion but I did not manage to use debug-on-entry for that. I found the pcomplete-completions-at-point function by evaluating &quot;completion-at-point-functions&quot; in the buffer.
 Any tips would be welcome.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m able to jump to the definition with the following combination: M-x find-variable RET RET.

                    <span>I am using Emacs 28.0.90 and lsp-mode for Go. Most things are working, but packages imported from a github URL are not being found. For example, in the following code there is no trouble finding things from the fmt, os, or time packages, but I get complaints about the other three packages. 
 import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;os&quot; &quot;time&quot; &quot;github.com/cilium/ebpf&quot; &quot;github.com/urfave/cli/v2&quot; &quot;spacelaser.net/zpr/pkg/snet/cfg&quot; ) 
 The error I get is &quot;could not import github.com/cilium/ebpf (no package for import github.com/cilium/ebpf&quot;. I have the variable lsp-go-library-directories-include-go-modules set to t and the directory $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/cilium/ebpf@v0.7.0 exists and has the correct code in it. What am I missing to make LSP pick up these libraries?

 But terminal gave me this:
 elem :: (Foldable t, Eq a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; t a -&gt; Bool 
 I have just started learning Haskell. My best guess is that foldable is a protocol/typeclass to represent a generic container as opposed to a list []. But is there a better explanation?

                    <span>José Calderón is interviewed by Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra . José has been working on functional programming at Galois and University of Maryland. He tells us about his research background in many different continents, his experience with teaching compilers, the relation between music and functional programming and the “Recursive Programming Techniques” book that in the 1970s captured the essence of functional programming.

                    <span>Running the following with stack script --resolver&#x3D;ghc-9.0.1 works, but running with stack script --resolver&#x3D;ghc-9.2.1 results in a stack overflow. Oddly, it works on ghc-9.2.1 compiling with -O2 but hangs when compiling with -O0.
 This behavior is surprising to me because, to my understanding, UndecidableSuperClasses carries the risk of infinite loops when type-checking, but at compile-time, it should concretize m and FooM m and the constraints should be erased. Is this not what happens? And did anything change in GHC 9.2 regarding UndecidableSuperClasses?
 I&#x27;ve also dumped out -ddump-tc for both -O2 and -O0, but I don&#x27;t see any meaningful differences.
 Repro:
 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableSuperClasses #-} import Data.Kind (Type) class (Monad m, MonadFoo (FooM m)) &#x3D;&gt; MonadFoo m where type FooM m :: Type -&gt; Type runFoo :: FooM m a -&gt; m a newtype MyMonad m a &#x3D; MyMonad { runMyMonad :: m a } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) instance Monad m &#x3D;&gt; MonadFoo (MyMonad m) where type FooM (MyMonad m) &#x3D; MyMonad m runFoo &#x3D; id main :: IO () main &#x3D; runMyMonad foo foo :: MonadFoo m &#x3D;&gt; m () foo &#x3D; runFoo $ return () 
 Update: It seems reproducible with even main &#x3D; runMyMonad $ runFoo $ return ()

                    <span>I can&#x27;t figure this out...
 I use a basic org-capture template:
 (setq 
 org-capture-templates
 \(&#x60;
 (&quot;t&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (file &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/tasks.org&quot;)
 &quot;* TODO %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i&quot; :empty-lines 1)
 (&quot;i&quot; &quot;Idea&quot; entry (file &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/ideas.org&quot;)
 &quot;* IDEA %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i&quot; :empty-lines 1)
 (&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal&quot; entry (file+datetree &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/journal.org&quot;)
 &quot;* %?\n %i\n&quot;)
 )
 )
 When I start the capture and select &#x27;j&#x27; to create a Journal entry, my first line has 7 stars. This causes the entry to start too far to the right and it looks weird. I can&#x27;t figure out why so many stars? Instead of 7, I expect maybe 4 stars:
 * Year
 ** Year-Month
 *** Year-Month-Day
 **** new journal entry goes here
 In an effort to learn elisp and try to fix the problem, I tried to modify org-datetree.el in the ~/.emacs/elpa/org-9.5.1 directory and recompile via emacs-lisp-recompile function after visiting the file. My modifications change the output (I removed tabs for example), but then it removes all of the dates! I don&#x27;t want to mess too much with the el file as my configuration is getting to a nice stable state.
 Any ideas why so many stars? Thanks in advance for looking at this!

                    <span>Is ther anyway to export existing anki cards to org-mode?
 I have found some github projects that deals with creating cards with org-mode, but not the other way arround.
 I eventually would like to convert notes (org files) to anki cards, but to be able to do that I first have to export my existing anki cards to org-mode.

I have nearly 4 years of experience, in those 4 years, I have 2 years of FP Scala experience. I&#x27;m a contractor, working fully remote, and currently getting 300EUR per day.

                    <span>Hi! This is my first time posting on this subreddit. 
 I am currently an intern at a bank that&#x27;s using Java and Spring for almost all of its backend services. My mentor tasked me to explore the basics of Scala for backend services so I&#x27;m here to ask for recommendations how one would build backend services as I&#x27;ve read around Scala doesn&#x27;t depend as much on frameworks as Java does. 
 I&#x27;ve read on some &#x27;frameworks&#x27; for Scala such as Play and Http4s, but the resources on those are quite scarce, and I&#x27;ve tried Http4s but I can&#x27;t get my head to wrap around dependency management using sbt.
 Are there any recommendations you would give me for learning?
 Thank you for your help!

Haskell takes these characteristics to the extreme. For example, doing any input/output is considered impure from a functional programming point of view.

                    <span>Is there a convention for user defined keybinding prefix? Based on this elisp manual I thought C-c was supposed to be that. While those are safe in lisp-mode, they are not in other major modes (org-mode, python-mode, go-mode...) that override the keybinds.
 Where do you map all your extra commands to so you don&#x27;t constantly fight with major-modes?
 EDIT: People pointed out that C-c LETTER is being saved for the user, which I misunderstood as it included other symbols as well. Thanks everyone.

Also create a link *back* to the item I linked from?
 Do a search on a headline for all items that link to it?
  
Thanks!

                    <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m getting a new dev vm set up at a new job that requires jumping through some socks-proxy shaped hoops. So far, everything seems to be working either via the https_proxy env, ProxyCommand for git/ssh, or manually setting the proxy in Firefox. However, Emacs, when talking to any of the package repos, be they melpa, elpa, or gnu, always immediately errors with &quot;incomprehensible buffer&quot;. I haven&#x27;t found anything that makes any difference. I&#x27;d love to hear any ideas y&#x27;all have. TIA!

                    <span>I have been a happy Gnus user for years. Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:
  
Make &quot;sent&quot; messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I&#x27;ve made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.
 
I use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an &quot;undisclosed recipients&quot; email).
 
I wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I&#x27;ve sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn&#x27;t seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states &quot;this is a duplicate&quot;.
 Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a &quot;sent&quot; box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?

                    <span>I am working with lsp and company and found a very annoying feature that i would like to disable, when there is only one thing that can be suggested it is displayed like the image below, basically the word or symbol is &quot;auto completed&quot; on its own if i press tab if it is only a single suggestion. The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.

 EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character &quot;t&quot; (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (). 
 (define-key company-active-map (kbd &quot;tab&quot;) #&#x27;company-complete-selection) 
 This above was causing the character &quot;t&quot;, when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.
 (define-key company-active-map [tab] #&#x27;company-complete-selection) 
 This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion.

                    <span>For the last few months I&#x27;ve been taking the source from the GH mirror and building my own Emacs.

A bunch of the compilation errors refer to the same structs/data types so I grabbed a sample of one of each (but maybe I missed one &quot;type&quot;):

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure why but suddenly when I open projects with projectile it is also including the millions of files inside the .git dir within the project. This clutters up the list of the actual files I want to work on. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what change I made to cause this (it was not a change with my emacs config, but I have been messing around with my git config recently). Is there a way to get projectile to ignore .git dirs recursively, and globally?

                    <span>Hey all, my question relates to what is the best approach to add some customization in a package&#x27;s implementation. For example, the code block below I have added some lines to the initial implementation but, I am not sure, wether this is practical since some updates later will ament the code added in the file. 
 I hope I am clear, but to add some clarification, while I am adding/editing the code in the package&#x27;s implementation found in the installation, would there be a more efficient way to call this instead of editing the file here. 
 Example below -commented lines are the ones I have added in the original file- after updating the package they will be lost
 (defun sclang-switch-to-workspace () (interactive) (let ((buffer (get-buffer sclang-workspace-buffer))) (unless buffer (setq buffer (get-buffer-create sclang-workspace-buffer)) (with-current-buffer buffer (sclang-mode) (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent map sclang-mode-map) (sclang-fill-workspace-mode-map map) (use-local-map map)) (let ((line (concat &quot;// &quot; (make-string 69 ?&#x3D;) &quot;\n&quot;))) (insert line) (insert &quot;// SuperCollider Workspace \n&quot;) ;; (insert &quot;// &quot; (current-time-string) &quot;\n&quot;) ;; (insert &quot;// Ready to do thy Biding Master &quot; (user-login-name) &quot;\n&quot;) ;; (insert line) (insert &quot;// using HTML Help: C-c C-h as usual, then switch to w3m buffer\n&quot;) (insert &quot;// and do M-x sclang-minor-mode in order te enable sclang code execution\n&quot;) (insert line) (insert &quot;\n&quot;)) (set-buffer-modified-p nil) cwd to sclang-runtime-directory (if (and sclang-runtime-directory (file-directory-p sclang-runtime-directory)) (setq default-directory sclang-runtime-directory)))) (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

                    <span>Forgive the title, but I&#x27;m going crazy here. I have spent 14 hours trying to get this to work and no luck.
 The issue is back-links won&#x27;t show up in my org-roam buffer.
 This is my config:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) t) (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/org-roam&quot;)) (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) (require &#x27;org-roam) (org-roam-setup) 
 I have installed org-roam, and org-roam--sqlite-available-p is set to t.
 I created the nodes with org-roam-node-insert and can follow the links just fine with org-open-at-point.
 You can see my org-roam folder here (and my config file is in there too).
 https://github.com/thread314/org-roam-troubleshoot
 I&#x27;ve deleted my .emacs.d folder and run emacs -Q, same result. I&#x27;ve even tried it on a completely fresh virtual machine, backlinks still won&#x27;t show up.
 I am running Emacs 27.2, Org 9.4.4 and Org-Roam 2.1.0.
 I have tried asking for help on the org-roam discourse and on the org-roam slack, no luck with either.
 I must be doing something wrong, but I just can&#x27;t figure out what. Can anyone help?
 I&#x27;d be happy to make a donation of $200 AUD to a charity of your choosing if you can help me with this (if that helps sweeten the pot).

                    <span>For example, if I run M-x shell it opens a new buffer instead of changing the current buffer. The older version of emacs I used didn&#x27;t do that.

                    <span>Given a set of coins and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.
 Note: a coin with a unit value is always assumed to exist in the given set of coins.
 Examples:
  
 Coins Amount min. no. of coins 
  
 {1,5,10,25} 1 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 4 4 
  {1,5,10,25} 5 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 6 2 
  {1,5,10,21,25} 63 3 
 
  
Say we are given a set of coins Cs &#x3D; {1,5,10,21,25} and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up 63, then the algorithm below essentially translates to the following:
  answer &#x3D; min_coins(Cs, 63) &#x3D; minimum ( min_coins(Cs, 62) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 58) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 53) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 42) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 38) + 1 ) 
 A direct haskell implementation of the above strategy is:

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to use MonadUnliftIO in my monad transformer stack while serving a Servant API. For example:
 haskell newtype AppM a &#x3D; AppM { runAppM :: Handler } deriving ( Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadIO, MonadUnliftIO -- This fails to compile ) 
 The problem is that Handler cannot derive MonadUnliftIO as it&#x27;s a newtype over ExceptT ServerError IO a, which does not have an instance for it.
 In order to get derive an instance, here&#x27;s a possible solution: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
 module Lib where
 import Control.Exception (try) import Control.Monad.Except (ExceptT (ExceptT)) import Control.Monad.IO.Class (MonadIO (liftIO)) import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp (run) import Servant (EmptyAPI (EmptyAPI), Handler…</span>

Aside from the lack of usage of modules, and Control.Monad.Error being deprecated, and the lack of unit testing, is there any other notable difference between the code in the book and modern idiomatic Haskell?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been going through the University of Finland MOOC course on haskell, and this example popped up:
 ​
 someLetters :: Gen String someLetters &#x3D; do c  sample someLetters &quot;yyyyyyyy&quot; &quot;zzzzzzzzz&quot; &quot;xxxxxxxxx&quot; &quot;yyyyyyy&quot; &quot;yyy&quot; &quot;ww&quot; &quot;xxxxxx&quot; &quot;yyy&quot; &quot;yyyyyyy&quot; &quot;xxxxxxxxxx&quot; &quot;y&quot; 
 My question is how is this &#x27;someletters&#x27; fn a pure fn? It will always return a List of strings, but the strings will always be different. If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.
 Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?
 TIA

 When I tangle, I want this output:

 But what I get is this; the second block is dedented, which produces broken output:

 Is there some way to get Org to preserve whitespace in source blocks?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I am looking to solve the following problem. I am using org-agenda to view items marked as TODO. This presents a list. The list is long and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to scan. Ideally, I would like to have an interface where only the first item would load, I would hit &quot;n&quot; and then the next and the next and so on until there are no items left.
 Is this possible to do? What are the steps to take to achieve this?
 Thanks very much!
 I am running Spacemacs (0.200.13@27.2)

                    <span>Hi all, I am in a dilemma. I have switched to a new job, now in my previous role I was working as a data engineer (scala and spark) and in the new role they want to put me in a team which deals with data processing (scala, spark, Kafka, akka streams, samza) but there is another team which deals with rest api development (scala, akka http, grpc, cats). I can choose where I want to be but this is where I am not able to make a decision. They have also told me that in future if I feel like the type of work I am doing is not for me then I can ask for change. Just want your inputs.

So I changed it to &#x60;shell-command-to-string &quot;chatty&quot;&#x60; and it gives me an output of &#x60;/bin/sh: line 1: chatty: command not found&#x60; but running &#x60;chatty&#x60; in my terminal launches the app just fine. 
 ​
 Is there something I can run that would launch programs on my system?

                    <span>So my emacs config is taking about ~20 sec to load which is really slow compared to the slowest load speed which I heard was around 5-7 sec? Just the previous day it loaded at about 4 sec. I haven&#x27;t really changed anything in my config since yesterday. What may have been the problem?

                    <span>Hi there! :)
 I wanted to share a package that I have developed. This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. 
 As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:
 - The user have access to all of the output from a session
 - The user gets a notification when a session has finished
 - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure
 - Sessions can be started on remote hosts
 - The user can easily rerun a session
 - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile
 For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;if1W58SrClk
 And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers, and in particular, hej fellow hyperbole users,
 I recently started using Hyperbole as a knowledge base and must say I am quite satisfied. I have in as an org extension so I get the benefit of being able to hide/show contents while retaining the functionality of hyperbole/hyrolo (I believe, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).
 However, there&#x27;s one thing that really annoys me, and I would like to know how to change that. Whenever I come out of a hyrolo-fgrep query, my hyrolo file is in read-only mode. Which means that I have to change out of it every time I made an edit. I C-s&#x27;ed through the Hyperbole manual but couldn&#x27;t find it mentioned anywhere.
 Since I am not yet very proficient with the inner workings of my kitchen-si *ahem* batteries-included computing environment I don&#x27;t even have a good idea on how to debug it. Thus, any more or less general considerations are also warmly welcomed!
 Have a good day, fellows :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a slow program in Advent of Code. I&#x27;d like to profile it to see what&#x27;s slow.
 I&#x27;ve got each day&#x27;s program as a different executable in a single Cabal project. You can see the code on Gitlab.
 Cabal 3.6.2, GHC 9.2.1.
 My Cabal file looks like this:

                    <span>I feel like it is something stupid that I&#x27;m doing, but I just cannot figure it out on my own. I created a simple project with cabal and it created basic project structure. I added another module that I called Work.hs into the same app folder that the Main.hs is at. VS Code doesn&#x27;t show any errors but when I run it with ghcid I get this error:
 app/Main.hs:5:1: error: Could not find module ‘Work’ Use -v (or &#x60;:set -v&#x60; in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 5 | import Work

                    <span>Hi, I am very new to haskell and recently I decided to read a book called Linear algebra 
 [Theory , Intuition, Code]. This book uses python+MATLAB as it&#x27;s language but I don&#x27;t like python that much and I don&#x27;t know matlab so I have been wondering are there any libraries that cover the linearalgebra funcitonality of numpy?

                    <span>I am doing a job search for a new position and thought now would be the perfect time to switch languages (currently done just OOP stuff)
 However I don&#x27;t have much Haskell knowledge (done learn you a Haskell and working on Haskell from first principals) Every job seems to require several years of experience with Haskell
 Are there jobs that are more like work studies or internships for learning Haskell? Where I can restart as a complete beginner to get experience?

                    <span>Do you use images in your notes regularly? 
 If so, what are your practices, tips, and tricks?
 ​
 The manual on images seems to be very basic. 
 ​
 I use the org-download package by abo-abo (https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download) to drop images into a note. 
 ​
 Should I always prepare them beforehand to have a consistent look (e.g. to have the same width through all the notes)?

 I thought this might be interesting for you all.
 Generate an HTML version of your agenda and then make it a default landing page in your browser. Result: every time you create a new tab you get a peek at your updated agenda. 
 Keeps me slightly more organized.
 Here&#x27;s the repo (not in Melpa): https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/agenda-html
 I run it like so (in my config):
  (add-hook &#x27;org-after-todo-state-change-hook (lambda () (run-with-idle-timer 20 nil (lambda () (load-file &quot;/Users/trae/workspace/github/agenda-html/agenda-html.el&quot;)))))  and here&#x27;s is what my new tab looks like:

                    <span>Twice a year — in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Preparation
Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we
weren’t able to decide whether the hackathon would happen at all until

 I haven&#x27;t found anything like &#x60;cl-format&#x60; in &#x60;cl-lib&#x60;?
 Is this just not implemented or is it planned to be done at some point?

                    <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to make counsel-fzf work on my windows setup and I can&#x27;t seem to manage. I&#x27;ve downloaded the fzf.exe binary and placed it in c:/emacs/bin and made that path available for emacs (both in exec-path and in the &quot;PATH&quot; variable). The command doesn&#x27;t do anything. It seems that it creates the process but there is no autocompletion list.
 Also, maybe related, when trying to run fzf from the *shell* it doesn&#x27;t provide the autocomplete list, even though it does so in windows cmd.
 Any toughts?

                    <span>For a while I&#x27;ve been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O&#x27;Toole. The blurb says:
  
Cell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.
  
I decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I&#x27;d like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like &quot;killer app&quot; for Emacs. It may sound like I&#x27;m exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:
  
integrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.
 integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.
 as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.
 easy CSV (etc) editing.
 derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).
  
I&#x27;m sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.
 Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O&#x27;Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.

                    <span>Hi, I would like to replicate some of this behavior: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goessner/mdmath/master/img/mdmath.gif
 The interesting part is seeing a representation of a latex equation as I&#x27;m typing them. Toggling the preview on and off is good in itself, but the live preview looks really, really nice. Is there a neat way to do this? I&#x27;m mostly interested in seeing equation live.

                    <span>I constantly open new emacs Frames and reposition relative to other applications (Ik, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not fully emacs yet), and found that manually repositioning the windows was a pain. Here&#x27;s a script and some keybindings I made to make that easier. These functions can also be called at startup to change how you want the initial emacs screen size to be.
 Explanation: It&#x27;s pretty simple, these functions just set the frame position, and size as portions of your initial starting screen size. 
 Hopefully, this helps someone, and any suggestions for improving code readability would be appreciated!

                    <span>One of my favorite parts of Org-mode is the customizable colored headers; personally, it makes me extremely motivated to work and makes Org-mode so much more beautiful. Here&#x27;s a quick script I made to make changing those colors easier, and hopefully, someone finds this helpful!
 ​
  
First, generate a palette you like from this color palette generator: https://coolors.co
 Copy the RGB color codes, separated by hyphens, from the url
 Paste it into the list in the same format as I have in the below code snippet
 Copy the code into your init file somewhere
  
Essentially, the code splits the string into a list of codes, then the face attributes set the org header colors to the corresponding list colors.
 I&#x27;d like to turn this into a package one day, but that&#x27;s a project for another time (or if someone wants to help me, I&#x27;d love to work with them). And finally, if anyone uses this, drop your color palettes below!
 ​
  (defun col-strip (col-str) (butlast (split-string (mapconcat (lambda (x) (concat &quot;#&quot; x &quot; &quot;)) (split-string col-str &quot;-&quot;) &quot;&quot;) &quot; &quot;))) (setq color-schemes (list (col-strip &quot;a21d1d-5497de-8e35b7-ffff5b-56cb7d-df5252-707efa&quot;) ; red blue purple study (col-strip &quot;2278bf-e15554-3bb273-507c6d-6e5775-598d91-7768ae&quot;) ; blue red green okay )) (setq pick-color 0) (setq color-theme (nth pick-color color-schemes)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-1 nil :height 1.3 :foreground (nth 0 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-2 nil :height 1.2 :foreground (nth 1 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-3 nil :height 1.1 :foreground (nth 2 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-4 nil :height 1.05 :foreground (nth 3 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-5 nil :foreground (nth 4 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-6 nil :foreground (nth 5 color-theme))

                    <span>So, I started using Emacs yesterday, and it has been amazing! I am using the Doom Emacs distribution. I decided I am going to integrate Emacs in almost every part of my life, so I decided to switch to ORG mode from libreoffice. The switch wasn&#x27;t that easy but I did it. But now I need to know how to resize an image in Emacs, because sometimes I need to add images to my notes and documents. Thank you in advance

                    <span>Firstly doom emacs is great and God bless hlissner. But there&#x27;s one issue I&#x27;ve not yet been able to solve. 
 In doom emacs when the cursor is on a string, it highlights the entire string. But this really slows the app down and makes the editing process really annoying in the case of long strings. 
 Example
 In the above link, I am trying to edit a graphql schema which is a multi line string. And the entire string being highlighted every moment makes it really laggy and nearly impossible to edit. 
 So my question is how do I turn of this string highlighting feature in doom emacs? Thanks
 PS: I have googled for this but I couldn&#x27;t find te solution to this exact problem. Most of the solutions were to disable the hl-line mode which I don&#x27;t have a problem with.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got all ESS packages installed via MELPA, I can enter R mode and run R commands, everything seems OK, except TAB completion for objects or parameters simply does not work (although it does perform indenting correction, which is one of the TAB features if a completion not detected). I have latest Emacs installed on Ubuntu 21.10, fresh install, no customization. Isn&#x27;t the latest ESS just supposed to work without any extra packages or configs? Is this a bug? Has the TAB completion been replaced by another command?

                    <span>I was reading a discussion about keyboards and decided that maybe this is something that would benefit others.
 I have been pressing Ctrl with my palm for years (just below left pinky). It only works with external keyboards, and it does not work very well for all Ctrl combinations (e.g. Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-X is at the limit of doable, in that case I use the right ctrl).
 but it has saved my pinky from being overworked
 (and yes, I tried dvorak, but I could not get used to emacs ctrl sequences no matter how much I tried... i was able to get to around 40-50 words a minute for text, but like 1 emacs command per minute --after 59 wrong commands).
 Aside from mapping CAPS lock to Ctrl, are there any other tricks people use with the typical keyboard?
 Edit: somebody mentioned that this is probably useful only for small sizes of hands. When fully extended my hands are 21cm from tip of thumb to tip of pinky.

                    <span>According to Transient documentation:
 &quot;The command can also be a closure or lambda expression, but that should only be used for dynamic transients whose suffixes are defined when the prefix command is invoked. See information about the :setup-children function&quot;
 So according to that I tried the following:
 (defun set-children (children) &#x27;((1 transient-suffix (:key &quot;o&quot; :command normal-func)) ;; OK (1 transient-suffix (:key &quot;k&quot; :description (lambda () &quot;All ok&quot;) :command (lambda (message &quot;hey&quot;)))))) (transient-define-prefix my-transient () [&quot;Description&quot; :setup-children set-children]) 
 I&#x27;m getting (wrong-type-argument (command symbol) (lambda nil &quot;hey&quot;))
 So it seems that it only accepts symbols
 Any ideas? thanks in advance

                    <span>I&#x27;ve often heard emacs described as a plaform to build editors, but aside from evil mode, I don&#x27;t know of any other radical rebuilds of the editing experience. While I like emacs, the keybindings are brutal to my old worn tendons. I know I can change them, but I lack the wherewithal to undertake a radical rebuild. I&#x27;m perfectly comfortable with vi but prefer something that&#x27;s not modal. Are there any other total redesigns of keybindings or editing I should look at?

I have an rss feed set up which I can attach to youtube subscriptions, but I&#x27;m at a total loss on how to play videos in VLC or something else from Emacs. I&#x27;ve tried the vlc package from melpa, I&#x27;ve fiddled around with the vlc.el file for hours, followed tutorials, and I got nothing to work right. Does anyone have any advice?

                    <span>I am seeking someone to partner with who can teach Haskell to absolute beginners. And when I say beginners - I mean zero programming experience. 
 This would be an online class - taught for 2 hours per day. Time of day and length of course to be determined. 
 This person will need to develop the class material without references to other programming languages or concepts. 
 Message me to discuss.
 Edit: 1. Time zone is one of the 4 US mainland time zones 2. Assumed knowledge would be high school and fluent English 3. Targeted toward Cardano smart contracts 4. Using whatever device they own (if there are device requirements that can be communicated to students prior to sign up) 5. Moneys is to be determined based off of length of class and number of students.

I always run it in GHCI, and when I was using Stack I&#x27;m pretty sure I could rebuild incrementally. But then it stopped building in Stack, so I switched to Cabal, which only lets me rebuild incrementally for one subproject at a time -- if I make changes to another subproject, I have to quit and rerun cabal ghci. So suddenly compilation was taking a long time.
 I ducked the problem by just making it a monorepo again. But it made me wonder -- how hard would it be to make compiled code content-addressed, like Unison does?

                    <span>List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. 
 For example,
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x &lt;- [0..2] and y &lt;- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. 
 One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:
  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.
 The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables&#x27; references in a generator&#x27;s body.
 For example, 
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10*x..10*x+2]] 
 We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.
 Question:
 Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables&#x27; references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?
 Thanks
  
Edit:
 Some one possibly misunderstand my question.
 For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [[x1] | x1 &lt;- [0..2]]
 [[x1,x2] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 &lt;- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]
 -- and so on &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way. It would be nice if code can be seen as data (e.g. List).

Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (PL or UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period (where circumstances allow). We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won&#x27;t be able to see your application until you pass this assessment.

                    <span>Hello Haskellers!
 Cutting to the chase: I have a cabal project for Advent of Code, and would like to profile it. I am familiar with profiling single *.hs files, but I would like to be able to profile the entire project.
 What is the recommended best practice for doing this with cabal? I tried google, but it appears as though my googlefu need some work. My cabal file, as well as the rest of the project can be found here.
 If any more information is needed, please do let me know!

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m currently writing up my PhD thesis using org-mode, and it is a joy in comparison to my past experiences writing raw LaTeX. 
 I&#x27;m simultaneously attempting to write up some of the thesis chapters in paper form for publication, and have been creating the papers by selectively #+INCLUDE -ing the thesis chapter .org files. I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. 
 This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. 
 Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hello! I am confused on how org-agenda-list is picking up an old file that doesn’t exist on my file system anymore, nor is it in org-agenda-files.
 The file it’s picking up is an old conflicted copy (by NextCloud sync) that I have since removed. It manages to show the old contents of that file so I assume it’s caches somewhere.
 Is my assumption correct? Is there a cache somewhere?
 I am using emacsclient and I have restarted it a couple of times with kill-emacs.
 What should I try next?

I can&#x27;t find very much in Google and StackOverflow is not the right place because my question is too open, and the subreddit r/learnscala seems to be dead. So is there any place where I can post my newbie question? Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to match generic implicit conversion with quotes. Minified example:
 case class Wrapper[T](i: T) given converter[T]: Conversion[Wrapper[T], T] with def apply(wrapper: Wrapper[T]) &#x3D; wrapper.i conversionParser { 1 + Wrapper(2) } 
 with
 // Want it to print &quot;Success&quot; def conversionParserImpl[T: Type](expr: Expr[T])(using Quotes): Expr[Unit] &#x3D; println(s&quot;Matching ${expr.show}&quot;) expr match case &#x27;{($a: Int) + ($b: Int)} &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Addition&quot;) conversionParserImpl(a) conversionParserImpl(b) case &#x27;{$a: Int} if a.value.isDefined &#x3D;&gt; println(s&quot;Literal: ${a.valueOrAbort}&quot;) case &#x27;{converter.apply($a)} &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Success&quot;) case _ &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Not matched&quot;) &#x27;{()} inline def conversionParser[T](inline expr: T) &#x3D; ${ conversionParserImpl(&#x27;expr) 
 But output is:
 Matching 1.+(Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2))) Addition Matching 1 Literal: 1 Matching Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2)) Not matched 
 If the converter is changed from generic to concrete Int, then the quoted code matches without any changes to the macro. Tried case &#x27;{converter[Int].apply($a)} in the generic case, doesn&#x27;t fix it.
 Thanks in advance for your help :)

 I have been working in scala but only for writing spark jobs. Now from past few months, I have started learning FP in scala. I want to get into more depth. Any suggestions are welcome on how do I plan myself for it.
 Also, taking a Math course, will it benefit. If yes, please let me know any online courses for Maths. ( Ofcourse, FP is the hardest thing, but I want to get into it, slowly )
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

 At this moment, I&#x27;d be happy if someone could share a link to prebuilt binaries for any of the recent versions of pdf-tools.
 I&#x27;ve tried with mysys and mingw, but I&#x27;m still getting errors: &#x60;&#x60; $ make -s Using Emacs 28.0 Importing package-keyring.gpg...

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Currently when i want to reference webpage in note (org-mode) i simply put url as link, but this method is not future proof. (website/company can die, url change, etc)
 How do you save / archive web pages?
 Do you use bookmarking tools like wallabag, shiori, etc?
 Or do you simply save webpage as pdf, epub etc?

                    <span>Hello, I have prettier set to show errors when the format isn&#x27;t correct. But in Emacs it shows an additional (formatting?) string. I don&#x27;t know where I should report this to. In vscode and the terminal it shows just the Delete &#x27;;&#x27; part. Is this an ESlint or LSP error?

 I hope this makes sense
  
EDIT. In the meanwhile I removed eslint-plugin-prettier and installed prettier.el. I don&#x27;t really need linting hints showing up as errors as it gets fixed on save, so this is great

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to play around with semantic highlighting in lsp, and what i was trying to do is properly highlight usages of a function&#x27;s argument/parameter within a given scope (say, code block, function etc.), and not only at the declaration point. It seems that lsp does understand scopes, looking through the source i found out that faces such as lsp-face-highlight-write/read/textual - which do actually highlight the variable when i hover over it with the cursor. Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member &amp; lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.
 In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink. (The Styling is just a sample)

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;ve been using ghcup to manage and install ghc, stack, and cabal on my mac. Now I tried installing ghc on windows with Chocolatey and Haskell Platform. It installs version 9.2.1 by default with &#x60;choco install haskell-dev&#x60;. I need version 8.10.7 installed since some packages that I&#x27;m using are not yet supported under 9.2.1. What&#x27;s the recommended way to install 8.10.7. Is ghcup a viable alternative? I tried it and it seems not to have &quot;tui&quot; available on Windows for some reason.
 Thank you!

                    <span>I am trying to upgrade GHC from 8.10.7 to 9.X.X. I am very new to Cabal/Stack/GHC, but wanting to get into Haskell development after really enjoying LINQ and F# as a full time C# engineer.
 ​
 I have brew (3.3.7), stack (2.7.3), and Cabal (3.6.2) installed, and I thought something as simple as &quot;cabal update&quot; or &quot;brew update&quot; or &quot;stack update&quot; would somehow magically work.
 ​
 For context, I am used to archlinux where arch documentation, a simple pacman -Syu or grabbing from the AUR solves 99.98% of my problems. But I am relatively new to apple hardware for development.
 Thanks a ton, and I apologize for the ignorance.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Currently when i want to reference webpage in note i simply put url as link, but this method is not future proof. (website/company can die, url change, etc)
 How do you save / archive web pages?
 Do you use bookmarking tools like wallabag, shiori, etc?
 Or do you simply save webpage as pdf, epub etc?

                    <span>Hey all! I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason, but I&#x27;ve also heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming, Simplified by Alvin Alexander. I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on either book, or if people would recommend one over the other or something like that. Any insight is appreciated!

                    <span>Greetings from Canada 🙂
I was using nvAlt and Simplenote together for about 10 years and recently migrated to my own app, Hyperdraft, which I consider a web remake of Notational Velocity; my app is not based on files, but it supports markdown and you can own your data.
I&#x27;m interested in the idea of &#x27;turning your text notes into a website&#x27; and have been cultivating a digital garden / personal wiki for about a year now, inspired by Andy Matuschak; in the same place as my private notes, I have other ones that are &#x27;public&#x27;, and they appear as pages on this website (wiki links become public URLs).
Learning about Zettelkasten over the last few years, it feels like I&#x27;ve been practicing it with todos and building projects, but not as much with &#x27;knowledge&#x27;—my notes about the work of others &#x27;slip away&#x27; because they are not interconnected and I don&#x27;t put them in my note taking app. (I&#x27;m looking for an app that approximates manual sorting of index cards).
The &#x27;searchable left-list&#x27; pattern is quite functional for me, and so I tend to incorporate it into all of my apps in some way. If you&#x27;re interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.
Hope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.</span>

                    <span>Is there an app out there that imitates the original Zettelkasten&#x27;s spatial positioning (sequential ordering of index cards)?

                    <span>I use emacs on various machines. I run the same init.el and set of packages everywhere, but different versions of emacs itself. In particular I want my setup to support a relatively old version of emacs (26.3) which I can find or easily install on random machines.
 As a result, I&#x27;d like to upgrade my packages but only when they are compatible with this maximum allowed version of emacs itself.
 I can hit &quot;U&quot; in the package list to mark all packages which can be upgraded up to my current emacs version. What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs. But this is cumbersome.
 Is there a command or a programmatic way to restrict this list to show only the upgrades which are compatible with the maximum allowed emacs version? I can&#x27;t find any commands for this. I looked for package functions for querying a package&#x27;s dependencies by package name, but it seems like most of the functions in package.el need a package-desc as input, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get that struct only from a package name and for available rather than installed versions.

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to write a function for prettifying symbols on a per-mode basis. The idea is to accept the mode-hook and a list of substitutions, and then to create a hook and engage it with the mode-hook. The function looks like this:
  (defun +xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook (mode-hook symbol-list) (interactive) (add-hook mode-hook (lambda () (mapc (lambda (pair) (push pair prettify-symbols-alist)) symbol-list) (global-prettify-symbols-mode 1))) (message &quot;Hook set.&quot;)) 
 An example of the intended use would be:
 (+xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;((&quot;#+BEGIN_SRC&quot; . ?») (&quot;#+begin_src&quot; . ?») (&quot;#+END_SRC&quot; . ?«) (&quot;#+end_src&quot; . ?«))) 
 I get no errors, but the hook does not seem to work. When I open new buffers of the given mode, the pretty-symbols do not appear. Any comments/suggestions would be very welcome as I am have very limited elisp experience.

 I wanted to decrease the start time in emacs and from what i read i have to activate daemon which i did but it created some kind of confusion for me! 
 Basically created a symlink with ln -s /etc/init.d/emacs /etc/init.d/emacs.myuser then activated in my run devel!
 What is happening when i am lunching emacs ? Am i lunching an emacs client ? is the emacs server the same thing as emacs client ?

 The class cue-group-start-offset contains the timestamps and cue style-scope ytd-transcript-body-renderer with attributes of role or tabindex is used for the transcript text.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a python setup with lsp, mspyls and company is used in the background for documentation completion (I think). For nearly all Numpy functions, company-show-doc-buffer returns an empty or sometimes wrong buffer. All other functions such as Scipy, built-ins or user-defined work perfectly well. Also, Code completion with company works fine for Numpy which is a bit weird.
 Has anyone encountered this as well? I read somewhere that Numpy added some decorators that might interfere with some APIs, but this also happens for old Numpy packages in a Python 3.5 environment.
 Please help :)

                    <span>Hej fellow parens haxx0rs,
 I am in the lengthy process of learning several lispy programming languages, one of them being guile scheme. I&#x27;ve installed the guile3 package using AUR on Manjaro successfully. Its binary resides in /usr/bin/guile3, and I am able to run it from the terminal no problem.
 For Scheme hacking, I want to use the Geiser package of which I heard only good stuff. I can use it with MIT Scheme and Guile-2.2.7, the implementation that is chosen when installed from official Manjaro repos. However, Geiser does not find guile3. When I try M-x geiser, it says &quot;Cannot find guile3 implementation&quot;.
 Find below how I&#x27;ve setup my use-package declaration. I use a small set of functions to decide whether I am on guix system or not, and depending on that the paths to a particular pro…</span>

                    <span>I am editing a file that I want to rename. So I press C-d RET. Now I move the cursor to the file I want to rename and press R. The Dired rename minibuffer is activated. I try to enter a new filename but fido-mode keeps autocompleting another matching filename in the current directory. Is there a way to make fido-mode not interfere with me typing a new filename?

                    <span>Is there any easy way to import the Hidden module to your code
 Currently, I have to download the package source code and untar it into stackproject/src and I can use those hidden module in my code.
  
Obviously, the obvious question is is there any simple way to import hidden module?

                    <span>Hello!
 I don&#x27;t understand how to get an index of locally available documentation and installed packages.
 I added the flag: &quot;Documentation: True&quot;, and indeed if I navigate to: &#x27;~/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/attoparsec-0.14.3-a88f9f2009aaf50ec4de28c96eaab575e97e192943bebbfec18a608dffd670fd/share/doc/html&#x27;, all the docs are there, and they even link back to the ghc documentation (in &#x27;file:///home/jurjen/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/share/doc/ghc-8.10.7/html/libraries&#x27;), which is great!
 But navigating or exploring to such funky directories is unwieldy and I cannot find a generated index and they are not linked into the standard index living in &#x27;ghcup/.../share/doc/ghc-8.10/html&#x27; which is annoying since that is my main source of information for installed packages.
 I tried to set the options 
  docdir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html/libraries/$libname htmldir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html haddockdir: $htmldir 
 But that didn&#x27;t seem to do nothing. Anyone know how to make a global index of all (user) installed packages with cabal?

                    <span>After learning Haskell for some time, I would say that grasping most libraries and using them to build applications is a doable task, what really puzzles me is how to cultivate the mindset to enable one to build complex libraries. Some examples would be servant (type-level concept), scotty (monad transformer concept), opaleye (profunctor concept), and a lot more. Many Haskell libraries use sophisticated techniques to achieve DSL, but we seem to lack learning materials (the design parts, not the practical usage parts) that are accessible to everyday programmers.

                    <span>This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I&#x27;m struggling a bit to figure it out. I&#x27;m trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I&#x27;m looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don&#x27;t see how to get the actual contents of the file. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s stored as a Blob, but there aren&#x27;t any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can&#x27;t transmit them.
 So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I&#x27;m assuming the problem isn&#x27;t actually super complex, but I&#x27;m just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I&#x27;m hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for something File -&gt; ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.
 Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn&#x27;t stored in a DragEvent.
 Is there any easy way to do what I&#x27;m trying?

                    <span>New on MELPA: python-MLS — multi-line (i)Python commands in the Python inferior shell
 One of the top iPython features I miss when using the python inferior shell in Emacs is the ability to use multi-line commands. python-MLS fills this gap, providing seamless multi-line command editing right at the prompt, with easy copy and paste in or out, a buffer-like editing experience, indentation, optimized fontification, persistent command history, history navigation, and more.

 Is there a way to do this?
 Edit: /u/moriturius provided the answer to this: M-backspace
 Edit 2: And it turns out Ctrl-backspace works, too.

                    <span>Hello all. I can link pdf in org mode by doing Ctrl-C Ctrl-l, this would show a prompt in the mini buffer and I can just choose &quot;file&quot; and select my pdf file. I can also write a description for it if I want. However, this would link to a complete PDF file, I would like to link to an exact page from that PDF. It doesnt need to be opened in emacs, I write stuff in org but I export as latex then as pdf; so the on Linux qpdfview takes care off that. Anyway, the command to insert the pdf file, if you expand it is:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf][some description]] 
 This would generate a some description and I can click on it (either inside emacs which opens the PDF with Docview or qpdfview if I export it org to pdf). I check this, https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html and tried to change the code to:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf::6][some description]] 
 so that it automatically opens to page 6 of the pdf. This does not seem to work.

 I am a big fan of the Eyebrowse package, it is a cornerstone of my Emacs usage.
 I have just one issue with it - under some circumstances, I lose all my window configurations when restarting Emacs. It really hurts, so I wrote a small package called eyebrowse-restore that automatically saves Eyebrowse window configurations for all your Emacs frames and allows you to use them again.

                    <span>Hi, I am looking for a way to override faces globally. For example force a face to inherit from another face all of its attributes. And want to avoid doing what i am doing below. What i do right now is something like the block below. But this is annoying. I looked into the Faces Wiki on Emacs found the remapping functionality - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Face-Remapping.html. But it works just for the current buffer as far as i know. I want to avoid hooks for buffer switches to use the remapping, and preferably have this in my config, execute once, override the faces and be done at that point.
 What I am trying to achieve is force a few packages, which use custom face attributes (i.e helm-rg) to use the default attributes of my theme (i.e make the helm-rg-preview-line-highlight face force inherit/override itself from my mode-line face styles etc.). I am using doom-one theme - https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes (on vanilla emacs, not doom)
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;dst nil ;; This is Just a sample, there are more attributes not specified here :underline &#x27;unspecified :slant &#x27;unspecified :weight &#x27;unspecified :height &#x27;unspecified :family &#x27;unspecified :foreground &#x27;unspecified :background &#x27;unspecified :inherit &#x27;src)

                    <span>I tagged it as AoC since my question came up doing one of those problems but its more of a general question I&#x27;d say.... 
 So I learned about Advent of Code and wanted to use it to learn some more Haskell.
 I did the first day, which went well. However I struggle with the second one...
 In theory it shouldn&#x27;t be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:
  
Read the lines
 Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)
 Sum up all values
 ---
  
1.-2. were no problem.
 With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that 
 foldl (\ p c -&gt; p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf
 where testInputf is a list of Strings ([String]).
 For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that 
  Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] 
 And I can&#x27;t figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?
 For testing purposes Ive also tried using map 
 map (read . last) testInputf 
 which throws the same error and I can&#x27;t figure out why...
 Thank you very much!

                    <span>Hi, r/haskell,
 I am working on Chameleon, an experimental visual type debugging tool for Haskell. A couple of months ago I posted an advertisement for a user study for Chameleon. After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges. Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed https://sup.ercu.be. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 I am happy to answer any questions regarding Chameleon in this thread.
 Thank you,

                    <span>Edit:
 Based on the comments by u/p3tr4gon, u/psycotica0, I kind of understand how this partially applied type constructor works like.
 My little example use-case:
 type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v --says IntMap is a Map with an Int key and some type v Value --my toy example function to return an IntMap String intMap :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; IntMap String intMap num str &#x3D; Map.singleton num str --and from the original question this also worked someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList :: IntMap String --------------------------------------------------------------------- --ghci output below Prelude&gt; :r [1 of 1] Compiling Shapes ( ch8_types.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. *Shapes&gt; intMap 2 &quot;Noah&quot; fromList [(2,&quot;Noah&quot;)] *Shapes&gt; myIntMap fromList [(1,&quot;Noah&quot;),(2,&quot;Lisa&quot;),(3,&quot;Mary&quot;),(4,&quot;Sandra&quot;)] 
 And I agree that this is a toy example that probably does not have many use cases.

 --partially apply type constructor type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v type IntMap&#x27; &#x3D; Map.Map Int 
 How would I use this? I only know how to make a so-called IntMap like this
 import qualified Data.Map as Map someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList --deleted due to typo please see edits above

                    <span>Hi all, just watching this presentation from EmacsConf 2021, and I saw that in his org file the presenter has a triangle symbol instead of #+Begin_SRC and a square symbol instead of #+End_SRC. Anyone know how to accomplish this??? Many thanks!

Can you suggest me some good online courses or websites or blogs anything will work.

 In particular I&#x27;m curious if/how records fit into the equation since tables seem straight-forward on their own.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to get org-return to call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation (e.g. &#x27;[cite:@author1998]&#x27;). Digging a little I see that org-return will only call org-open-at-point if (org-return-follows-link is non-nil and) calling (org-element-context) would yield something of the form &quot;(link (:type...&quot;. Since calling (org-element-context) yields something like &quot;(citation-reference...&quot;, org-open-at-point is never called when point is on a citation and I call org-return. 
 So... any easy way to do this, short of redefining org-return? (Or better, perhaps, to write a wrapper that will call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation and call org-return otherwise?) It seems to me that it would be convenient to have citations treated much like file:// expressions, but maybe there&#x27;s a reason for not doing this?

                    <span>Left field question. I often copy text from GMail into an emacs buffer for saving. Some of the spaces get rendered as light blue underlines as, hopefully, shown in the image below. The text I&#x27;m cutting looks just like regular text. Any ideas whats going on? Or how I&#x27;d learn more about what emacs is rendering?
 BTW its an org-mode buffer

                    <span>So the title says it. Basically, I have a buffer full of babel code blocks that I don&#x27;t want to run when I first load the buffer in Emacs. I see org-babel-execute-buffer, but how do you make sure it&#x27;s off? I think the default behavior is already not auto-evaluating the blocks, isn&#x27;t it, so I don&#x27;t need to worry. So yes, how do you definitively control the org-babel-execute-buffer behavior on or off? It seems though, that an export to HTML etc. does try to run evaluate all blocks. How can that be turned off?

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve been trying for 2 days to get this to work. This is obviously not the right way. I get *invalid* in the mode-line and the CPU total usage is instead displayed in the minibuffer. Also it does create a *Shell Command Output* buffer. That buffer is not desired. 
 Im aware that I need setq-default but for the purpose of testing I use with only setq. I test in the scratch buffer. Before someone comes and ask why? And say &quot;Emacs is a text editor!&quot; I run EXWM and I need the CPU/MEM total usage to be displayed all the time. I&#x27;ve been looking for a package that would display these info rather in the mode-line or in the systray. I&#x27;ve found nothing :( However, I did find a package that does display these info in the minibuffer. The minibuffer is not the best place for this tho. Also that package was making my Emacs slow af. Dont ask for the name of the package, I dont recall. Plus, I dont want to hit on someone else work. I cant even write this function alone, so ya. 
 So if you want to help, please do and thank you :) Also, Im pretty sure this little function could be appreciated by other Emacs users. 
 Here&#x27;s what I came with so far for the CPU:
 (defun cpu-usage-3 () &quot;Display CPU Usage&quot; (shell-command &quot;ps -A -o pcpu | tail -n+2 | paste -sd+ | bc&quot;)) ;; Found that ps command line on the internet. I did not create that. (setq mode-line-format (list &#x27;(:eval (cpu-usage-3))))

                    <span>Hello, I have a snippet set like so:
 import React from &#x27;react&#x27; const ${1:Component} &#x3D; ( ${2:$$(yas-choose-value &#x27;(&quot;\{ \}&quot; &quot;props&quot;))} ) &#x3D;&gt; { return ( $0 ) } export default $1 
 I have two questions:
  
How do I have the cursor at $2 be between the { }?
 yas-choose-value prompts to choose a value but I can&#x27;t use Tab to choose the second value. If I do, it disappears. I have to use the arrow key

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that the second release candidate for upcoming text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been just uploaded on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 What&#x27;s changed between rc1 and rc2?
 head.hackage has been updated to text-2.0, which helped to find and fix several bugs and regressions.
 What&#x27;s next?
 If no critical issues are identified in the next week or two, the final release of text-2.0 will follow shortly.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve started working on performance of the venerable but somewhat neglected pqueue package. The changes I&#x27;ve made so far are pretty obviously good, and make a big difference in even the most informal testing. But to make decisions about smaller points, I really need benchmarks, and the package has none. Does anyone know of a benchmark suite for priority queues? One that includes algorithms that involve persistent queue use would be particularly desirable, but I&#x27;ll take anything.

                    <span>I was musing about the following:
  
Would a language version*, where &#x27;in the case of a newtype everything (that&#x27;s derivable, including with language extensions, like GeneralizedNewTypeDeriving) is automatically derived, unless a manual derivation or a manual instance is defined (or manually suppressed, with a new syntax)&#x27; be more ergonomic?
  
I was thinking about this, because I noticed that with quick problems I was often reaching for type instead of newtype. The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.
  
*) I don&#x27;t pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.
  
Would this even be viable? Would there be undesirable consequences? Would it indeed improve ergonomics, or was that stray thought just a wrong impression?

I searched a lot on internet, but I want an easy explaination of language-server and haskell-language-server in simple words. If you can also explain it layman&#x27;s term, it would be very helpful, hopefully. I appreciate your help.

                    <span>My situation: I offer lots of training. Around a training, several date-sensitive activities need to happen, that I would like to see in my agenda e.g.
  
a week before the training I need to order materials and exams
 the day before I need to set up the online whiteboard
 the day of the training, I need to conduct the training (and would like this to be reflected by a due date)
 one day after the training, I want to send a link to a feedback form
  
You get the gist.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to set up a capture template so that I enter &quot;Training on subject X, on date Y&quot;, and org will automatically calculate the corresponding due dates for these surrounding activities and stick them into the newly captured structure.
 Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn Scala and need the docker plugin so that I can publish an image to my dockerhub repo. It&#x27;s very confusing to figure out how to do this, and there are so many steps involved. 
 I have created a simple hello-world app and running &#x60;sbt publishLocal&#x60; works fine. It seems like I need 2/3 different plugins for publishing to a remote repo? 
 If anyone has a simple example, it would be much appreciated! As long as I can run sbt publish from my terminal I&#x27;m happy
 Here is my code so far:
 ​
 build.sbt:
 scalaVersion :&#x3D; &quot;2.13.3&quot;
 name :&#x3D; &quot;hello-world&quot;
 organization :&#x3D; &quot;ch.epfl.scala&quot;
 version :&#x3D; &quot;1.0&quot;
 publishTo :&#x3D; Some(&quot;Hello-world app&quot; at &quot;&quot;)
 libraryDependencies +&#x3D; &quot;org.scala-lang.modules&quot; %% &quot;scala-parser-combinators&quot; % &quot;2.0.0&quot;
 ​
 plugins.sbt:
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.github.sbt&quot; % &quot;sbt-native-packager&quot; % &quot;1.9.4&quot;)
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;se.marcuslonnberg&quot; % &quot;sbt-docker&quot; % &quot;1.8.2&quot;)
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.eed3si9n&quot; % &quot;sbt-assembly&quot; % &quot;x.y.z&quot;)

                    <span>Slim pickings it seems, Proto Quill and Skunk, with JOOQ as the only stable offering (ironic that a Java library is the only one that is production ready to use with Scala 3).
 Ideally looking for something like Slick or Quill (i.e. composable type safe queries), but am probably going to be forced to go with JOOQ, which is as non-idiomatic Scala as it gets, or just ignore Scala 3 for another year and hope the landscape changes in the interim.
 Scala 3 adoption :\

                    <span>I love emacs as a text editor for programming. But I am trying to build a GTD system using emacs orgmode and calendar and the search lists and calendar displays on emacs always end up looking like a nightmarish wall of text that makes looking at them a pain, a bit too information-dense, making it hard to focus on things. My eyes just bounce around the screen without focusing on anything.
 Is there a way to build similar calendar and search screens on emacs that have instead a lot of white space and separation between items, and focusing in readability rather than on information density?
 I basically would like more structure and less text on screen.
 Some examples:
  
http://doc.norang.ca/block-agenda-nonproject.png
  
This is a task list, but it just presents line after the other of tasks with very little structure and forces you to read through everything to find things rather than having more structure and less crowded text.
  
https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/x2h2YKongReYZpjadF36L0fvICHhm0fZG4keZZlYmapLUzfpBHuIIBwgLu1AaCTSFmUhbneZ946iOxm60HFIpcrzEr5otlWbvHM5uDmE9OlTN9n4Q__2A6Obq28
  
Very crowded week-calenday-view with the tasks of one day just piling on top of the tasks of the next day and making it hard to get a clear, temporal view of the view.
 I haven&#x27;t been able to find any examples with more readable and less crowded views. Has anybody built anything like this? Or is emacs the wrong tool for this and maybe more centered for users that like to see a lot of information at once rather than more structured information? I realize it may be difficult to do what other task and calendar applications do with pure text, so I may be looking at the wrong tool.

                    <span>So I thought I might create a wrapper that uses advice to overwrite a function temporarily, re-routing it:
 (defun ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (&amp;rest body) (progn (advice-add &#x27;compose-mail :override #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail) (unwind-protect (progn body) (advice-remove &#x27;compose-mail #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail)))) 
 Turns out this doesn&#x27;t work when called via:
 (ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (compose-mail)) 
 What does work, though, is a macro!
 (defmacro ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (&amp;rest body) &#x60;(progn (advice-add &#x27;compose-mail :override #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail) (unwind-protect (progn ,@body) (advice-remove &#x27;compose-mail #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail)))) 
 I don&#x27;t understand the reason.
 Can anyone explain why the function doesn&#x27;t do its thing?

                    <span>Dear all.
 I have some text with selected phrases marked within asterisks (&quot;*&quot;) because org-mode syntax helps to visualize them inside the text, and I&#x27;d like to extract those phrases to another buffer.
 As I understand after some searching, one way is to use occur.
 However, I&#x27;m struggling (to say it lightly) to find a working regex for this occurrence that is &quot;whatever is between asterisks&quot;. I tried txt2regex but no success still...
 Does anyone knows a way to do this; or been in this situation and found a different approach? My lisp/regex fu is very much near the bottom, but I&#x27;m happy to learn.
 As always, thanks a lot for your time and attention. :)
 Best regards...
 ​
 PD: I&#x27;m thinking about ways to do semantic analysis with org-mode. If anyone&#x27;s interested on this we can arrange some collaboration. :)

                    <span>I have been using Emacs for many years. Thanks to the fantastic introduction to ELisp, I knew enough to &quot;configure&quot; Emacs. For some reason only recently have I started actually thinking about how I can make my computer-life easier; and Emacs is the one tool which poses least resistence when I try to. 
 I am kinda mad at myself for not doing this sooner, but also very happy that I finally did. I didn&#x27;t know where else to share this :-)
 In last few days, I have written 2 small bits of Elisp code (which took me embarassingly long to write, but the exercise was very rewarding).
  
First was publishing org subtrees as github issues; so I can stay in org-mode where I am very comfortable thinking and documenting my thoughts, and also push them to Github for colleagues. I can mark an issue as &quot;DONE&quot; and it closes the github issue, or change its content, or labels. 
 And a few minutes ago I wrote a little code to insert my org-roam notes as rust documentation comments
  
It&#x27;s not much, but it is honest work and I am happy I am finally doing it.

                    <span>I swear this used to work, but after a recent package update, I can&#x27;t seem to get it working again. 
 I looked online and can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation on this either.

                    <span>I need to investigate text log files a lot. Emacs with auto-revert-tail-mode does the job almost fine, except when there are long lines (JSON/XML dumps, 1-40kb large).
 In that case Emacs lags a lot.
 I use fundamental-mode + add few font-lock-add-keywords by (highlighting for INFO/DEBUG/ERROR &amp; for date/time):
 http://hg.defun.work/dot-emacs/file/tip/mylisp/log4-hi-mode.el
 Even with plain fundamental-mode Emacs is unresponsible. I tried debug on error on C-g and the stacktrace is only native rendering function redisplay_internal.
 Just writing the post I tried so-long-mode instead of fundamental-mode and it is much better but still noticeably lagging. Few extra font-lock-add-keywords in so-long-mode doesn&#x27;t have huge impact: movement is just a bit slower than without.
 I don&#x27;t like to open Notepad++ just for log files, though it might be the proper solution...
 Any suggestions on debugging long line issue?
 Could we expect Emacs rendering of long lines improved? 
 I&#x27;m with Cygwin Emacs W32 27.2. Almost the same situation with Emacs 27.1 in WSL1 terminal. so-long-mode provides better experience, few font-lock-add-keywords ruin smoothness of movement.
 UPDATE I really need some highlighting for log files (date/time + INFO/DEBUG/ERROR): I expect some help from the tool.

                    <span>Hi all,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m trying to move to Emacs 28, from Emacs 27, but I&#x27;m having all kinds of weird problems with the packages I use.
 This is my config BTW: https://github.com/croqaz/dotfiles/blob/main/emacs/Emacs.org
 Basically I have &quot;random errors&quot; with random packages.
 First there&#x27;s IVY and the suite of packages, the error is:
 custom-initialize-reset: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, ../../../../../../.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy/ivy
 I comment ivy, counsel, swiper, ivy-rich, then I get the same error about another package. I comment it and I get another error, etc until I comment: centaur-tabs, doom-modeline, dimmer, which-key, maybe a few more.
 Then I delete ~/.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy and re-enable ivy AND move it immediately after use-package initialization and now it works!
 Then I re-enable all of them, one by one until they all work again!
 It&#x27;s like one package in there is causing some problems and makes all the other packages after it, to go crazy, that&#x27;s why I have to move them higher to make it work.
 I tried this so so so many times, that I made it work, but it&#x27;s a huge pain!
 Anybody else that understands the new version, that can help me?
 Thank you in advance!
 EDIT 1: Other than the problem with packages that I just mentioned, upgrading from Emacs 27 to 28 was painless.
 EDIT 2: Actually I also had the same trouble with yasnippet, company, js2, typescript and LSP packages...

 I can write a simple command line (save-excursion (newline-and-indent)) but I&#x27;d love to know if there are any existing ones.

                    <span>Hello again,
 I have a custom keyboard shortcut for moving quicker in VIM (for Emacs I use EVIL) where I hold down CTRL and press HJKL I move faster in the direction.
 Like this:
 ;; Movement changes - BUG: When I release CTRL it still does one last 5 line jump when pressing one of my keys (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;) (kbd &quot;h5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-j&quot;) (kbd &quot;j5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-k&quot;) (kbd &quot;k5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) (kbd &quot;l5&quot;)) 
 However, in EMACS when I use this, it does work. But once I let go off CTRL it does ONE last 5 jump, despite that it should have stopped. It also feels a bit like there is a small delay when doing this.
 Does anyone know a possible solution for this to make it more responsive and NOT have a &quot;last&quot; jump after letting CTRL go.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m back with some more question for my quest to move over to emacs. This time it&#x27;s only about HELM (there will be more questions I&#x27;m sure of it), but this thread is only for HELM. 
 I have a couple of question I&#x27;d love to get some help with. I&#x27;ve tried googling for them, but only found answers that didn&#x27;t really answer the question, or I couldn&#x27;t actually understand how the answer worked. :(
  
Is there a way to make helm-find-file to also look in sub-directories? When I googled for this, most people suggested Projectile with helm, but I could not get that working at all. There was no error or such, but it did not search in sub-directories. 
 
Is there anyway to make helm open a new window (or frame, not sure what it is called in emacs) at the center of the screen? There was some old questions here on this reddit for it, but they were 5 years old and then it seems like it wasn&#x27;t possible. However, I saw on the official documentation that it should be possible. I just can&#x27;t get it to work for me. I tried using Shackle to solve it as well, and that improved it, but still does not feel as good. 
 
 I believe that was my two helm questions I was mostly struggling with. 
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>I usually take daily notes and are categorized under a topic.
 I want to go through a specific category and want to get those in one single buffer (search or otherwise) with the contents.
 So let&#x27;s say I have a category country, I want to revisit all the details under this category.
 I am using spacemacs and projectile. A project search or org-roam-find usually lets me search the header but doesn&#x27;t say whats in the content.
 Options I know of - 
  
Creating an index of country headers and creating its own org-id for org-roam and visiting them manually
 
org-transclusion, where I could include all the same categories in one buffer and that would let me explore the content.
 
 What I am looking for specifically is something that would not require me to make changes like above which would require creating org id for categories which I can use in a buffer. I want a simple approach where a search query would give me what I am looking for in a separate buffer.
 Thanks in advance!

 I was using Emacs to edit some code for an upcoming deadline, I fat fingered something, Emacs exited to terminal. Usually this would be fine, I&#x27;d lost a few minutes of work, BUT it appears the files were rolled back to near when I started the Emacs session that terminated (multiple hours)
 I saved tens of times during the session, but nevertheless all my work appears to be gone. Of course it was as I was about to make a commit and push.
 I would really appreciate any insight into what could have possibly happened. My best guess is a shortcut for &#x60;git reset --hard&#x60;, but even my GitHub repo is more up to date than my local files now (but still at least an hour behind).
 With or without knowing what happened, is there a way to get these files back? Any help would be obviously be appreciated.
 Edit: change first line status to solved

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to implement a caesar cypher (see below). I have a function (caesar) that shifts right, e.g. caesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; would result in &quot;bcd&quot;, that works as intended.

I would love an explanation on why the shiftLeft functions behave like they do :)

                    <span>I tried to solve Day 9, part one with algebraic graphs, a library I wanted to try out for a long time. I eventually failed(succeeded, thank to a performance hint of /u/jitwit), because my approach (build graph -&gt; remove all vertices that have a lower neighbour -&gt; count the value of the remaining vertices) relies on neighbours :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Graph a -&gt; Set a, which has an inefficient implementation (folds the whole graph, hence my algorithm is at least quadratic.) It still works for the example input tho! :)
 I would be glad about answer or general feedback about the my solution:
 -- I seem to need some kind of indexing, otherwise there is no way to distinguish vertexes. -- Question 1: Is there a smarter way to do it? -- 1 2 &#x3D;&gt; neighbours (vertex 1) will look for both 1&#x27;s ((0,0), 1) ((0,1…</span>

                    <span>Looking at the following syntax:
 getValues x1 &#x3D; do
 g &lt;- get
 let name &#x3D; &quot;aName&quot;
 return [Map.lookup x1 (myMap g)]
 ​
  
Does &lt;- get set g to the output of the return line? If not, what does g &lt;- get do?
 x1 appears to be the key to a map lookup, and myMap g is the map, but what is the relationship between the g in myMap g and the g in g &lt;- get. Recursive? There is no g as an argument to getValues.

                    <span>The stereotype is that only Senior Haskellers get hired. Perhaps it’s best to just ask any lurkers if their company actually hires and mentors Junior devs and is actively seeking them today. 
 So, who’s hiring Junior devs?

                    <span>I want to separate my daily tasks with appointments and all from the (embarrasingly) long list of badly maintained tasks -- overdue ones, soon-to-be due ones, and those that are schedule for a past date.
 It was simple enough to hide the overdue stuff from today&#x27;s timeline:
  (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot; &quot;) ;; Non-empty string to get empty line (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-ndays 1) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy (quote ((agenda time-up priority-down tag-up)))) ;; Do not include scheduled, due or overdue items here (org-deadline-warning-days 0) (org-scheduled-past-days 0) (org-deadline-past-days 0) (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t))) 
 But I cannot get that output to appear elsewhere, e.g. farther down, out of focus. This does display all overdue etc. taks, but also everything with a timestamp for today:
  (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Overdue&quot;) (org-agenda-time-grid nil) (org org-agenda-remove-timeranges-from-blocks t) (org-agenda-show-all-dates nil) (org-agenda-format-date &quot;&quot;) ;; Skip the date (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil) (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-ndays 0) (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;todo &#x27;done)) ;; Show overdue items (org-scheduled-past-days 999) (org-deadline-past-days 999) ;; Ignore upcoming deadlines (org-deadline-warning-days 0))) 
 How can I get the bottom part to only show overdue etc. tasks, not those that are scheduled for today? 
 Do I have to write a (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;todo &#x27;done)) replacement in elisp that filters elements by date, i.e. &quot;not today&quot;? (How? :))

                    <span>Who thought that pressing enter on a link in org mode should not open the link when it&#x27;s in a table would be a reasonable default and why?
 And even if you have a good answer to the first question, why is there no variable that makes it possible to activate the behaviour 99% of users would except?
 I think naming funktions &quot;org-&quot; is a horrible design, and that is mostly unique for org-mode I know no other package that does that, so it&#x27;s breaking standard coding practises in emacs, but then also add such bad defaults and no way to configure it in a sane way drives me insane.
 It&#x27;s a enourmous effort to not use standard keys, but please I am not willing to press some finger destroying C-c C-o, my health is to important to me to want that, and in no case I ever want to behave  to jump to the next line when the cursor is on a link. Does really somebody want this behaviour this way? You prefer pressing C-c C-o over ?
 Sorry for the rant, I need to make some tea... cheers.
 org-return-follows-link is set to  in this example btw, so normally return would open the link, just not in a table.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to put together a guide to Clojure as I&#x27;ve been using it, as an org file, with little illustrative bits of Clojure source embedded in the file, which I have a cider-repl evaluate &amp; which puts the results of each code snippet below the source code in a #+RESULTS: block. That&#x27;s all well and good when the thing we&#x27;re interested in is the return value(s) of the snippet, but I&#x27;ve been looking to try &amp; get the standard output written into the results too, or in a similar block maybe labelled as +#OUTPUT:.
 Does anyone know how this might be done? I suspect there must be some kind of option passed in the +#BEGIN_SRC CLOJURE line, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find out what it should be.

                    <span>Type-checking plugins interface directly with GHC’s constraint solver. This means we need to have
a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,

Memory Maintenance
Considering notes as proxies for memories, as the size and matrix of the archive grows, more time is spent maintaining existing notes. New notes should be created with abandon. Integrating them into the archive as wholly as I do. Editing them with abandon.
My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create and edit with abandon. Trust that magic will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does it mean to &quot;use&quot; a memory? I can use a note&#x27;s contents, and its idea can be reignited in me. It can spark new and novel ideas.

                    <span>Hi all,
 Problem Description
 I&#x27;m trying to have the same .org file exported to LaTeX and ox-hugo. I use the template docsy template to export to which uses an alert shortcode to render an alert/info area.
 In LaTeX I use awesomebox to render a similar block.
 The LaTeX output works perfectly when I am using 
  #+begin_noteblock This is a noteblock info environment from the awesomebox LaTeX package. #+end_noteblock 
 Now I want that noteblock to render into the following when using the ox-hugo export:
  {{% alert title&#x3D;&quot;Warning&quot; color&#x3D;&quot;warning&quot; %}} This is a warning. {{% /alert %}} 
 I found I should be able to use org-special-block-extras to do this conversion, but I seem to be getting it wrong, as on export no conversion happens. As I though there is maybe something wrong with the condit…</span>

                    <span>Hello there guys.
 So, I&#x27;ve recently got the source for Emacs 28.0.90 from https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git and built and installed it following the instructions. More specifically, I ran the following:
  
./autogen.sh
 /configure --with-native-compilation&#x3D;yes --with-json&#x3D;yes --with-gnutls&#x3D;yes --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid --with-mailutils&#x3D;yes --with-rsvg&#x3D;yes
 make -j4
 sudo make install
  
The compilation and install were successful, as well as the Doom install. However when I try to run Emacs I get the following error message:
 error: Invalid hash table rehash size, 1.0
 When I try to run an Emacs client (after successfully starting a daemon) I get a more elaborate error message:
 *ERROR*: Error in a Doom startup hook: server-after-make-frame-hook, doom-init-theme-h, (error &quot;Invalid hash table rehash size&quot; 1.0)
 The same happens when build and install Emacs 27.2 (source also from Savannah), without, of course, the native compilation flag on configure.
 I saw that some Spacemacs users ran into the same problem and submitted this issue. I tried, as suggested there, to run an apt upgrade, but had no success.
 Btw, I&#x27;m using Ubuntu 20 and Emacs works fine in the terminal.
 Has anyone ran into the same issue? How can I fix this? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using lsp-mode for a while now with eslint for my Node work stuff, and aside from screwing up some paths when initially installing it, everything worked just fine. But now we&#x27;re starting to transition to Typescript.
 I installed the ts-ls server without issue, and it runs just fine on *.ts files, but it&#x27;s also running for *.js files. Even stranger is that eslint is running at the same time! Now that both of them are running at the same time for a single file, syntax highlighting doesn&#x27;t work (although I get warnings and errors underlined as I expect). How do I configure this so that I don&#x27;t have both running?

 Is this expected behavior? If so, can someone point me to a standard knowledge base (book and/or any other media) that explains why this is so?

                    <span>There is an rss feed that I would like to follow:
 https://www.lawfareblog.com/feed?post_type&#x3D;all
 When I configure this in elfeed and use the tag +lawfare, elfeed shows only 3 items all from today Dec 8.
 When I configure the same feed in newsboat, I&#x27;m presented with 25 items going back to Dec 2.
 Does anyone know why this would be and if it is possible for elfeed to show me the same articles as newsboat?
 Thank you

                    <span>Got curious about bookmarks+ and downloaded it via quelpa today. After installation, I noticed a new behaviour when visiting dired buffers. 
 I visit a dired buffer, all details are hidden as per my config, but after 3 seconds or so, it suddenly shows all my details. Pressing &#x27;g&#x27; reverts it to the original setup, only to get overridden again after 3 seconds. I&#x27;ve singled it down to bookmarks+, since de-installation removes this bug.
 I&#x27;m posting it in this sub-reddit, since I couldn&#x27;t find a github for bookmarks+.

                    <span>Is it possible to add ob-kotlin to the org-babel-execute for Doom Emacs?
 Can you provide me some short guide? Thanks.

                    <span>I used Vim a lot back in the day, but eventually switch to Emacs for lisp.
 I&#x27;m trying out Doom Emacs, to get inspired for config improvements, and Vim style editing for lisps is very painful for me, post paredit.

                    <span>I really like that Emacs automatically knows where to indent some code and just sticks it there. 
 Doom, for some reason isn&#x27;t replicating this functionality. I see that in my JS file it&#x27;s using rjsx-indent-line as the indent function, and when I call that via elisp, I see the expected behavior, but when I repeatedly press tab, the line indents further than it should.
 Anybody know how to turn that off?

                    <span>On behalf of maintainers I&#x27;m happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.2.0 is finally released.
 Highlights from the changelog:
  
New functions: 
 ultra-fast SIMD-based isValidUtf8 validator,
 foldr&#x27;, foldr1&#x27;, scanl1, scanr, scanr1, takeEnd, dropEnd, takeWhileEnd, dropWhileEnd, spanEnd, breakEnd for lazy ByteString,
 writeFile to dump Builder directly,
 fromFilePath and toFilePath for locale-aware conversions.
 
 Performance improvements: 
 speed up floatDec and doubleDec up to 10x using Ryu algorithm,
 new SIMD-based count is up to 5x faster,
 improve inlining of foldl, foldl&#x27;, foldr, foldr&#x27;, mapAccumL, mapAccumR, scanl, scanr and filter,
 faster internal loop in unfoldrN,
 use a static lookup table for Base16 Builders.
 
 Add Lift instances for ByteString and ShortByteString.
 Put HasCallStack constraints onto partial functions.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:

                    <span>I am trying to write an IO action that bugs the user to enter a number within a certain range.
 Since the user is entering the number from the keyboard, I have to allow the possibility that
 the user types in something that cannot be converted into an Int value.
 ​
 This is what I have so far
 ​
 action2 :: Int -&gt; IO Int
 action2 n &#x3D; do
 putStrLn &quot;\nEnter action2 ...&quot;
 ​
 let m &#x3D; 2 * n 
 ​
 putStrLn $ &quot;n &#x3D; &quot; ++ (show n)
 putStrLn &quot;... leave action2\n&quot;

                    <span>If I were a teacher of high-schoolers wanting to connect some underlying theory to Haskell, could I explain Haskell list comprehensions as basically just a Cartesian/cross product machine? Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.
 Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the &quot;Translations&quot; box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I&#x27;d like to know how and why.

 val foo &#x3D; Default[Foo].value

 trait Default[T] { def value: T } implicit val defaultString &#x3D; new Default[String] { def value &#x3D; &quot;&quot; } implicit val defaultInt &#x3D; new Default[Int] { def value &#x3D; 0 } 
 and derivation for case classes with magnolia
 Is there any implementation for something like this?

                    <span>I have been learning Scala for quite sometime now and found it a nice language. Coming from the background of JavaScript and Python, I found Scala to be a really cool language.
 What I want to ask this community is that how many of you use Scala especially to build microservices using Play Framework... I feel like diving super deep into it but I plan to learn typescript as well... Now I know typescript is definitely a big game player but Scala is something I have been enjoying a bit...
 Is it worth learning Scala in 2022 or should I go with something like golang or Rust? I know it depends on what things I am dealing with but in that scenario javascript and python are answer to almost all my questions Unless performance walks in and now even modern optimized frameworks are handling that well too.
 As a developer, keeping all your love and affection for Java based languages aside do you think it&#x27;s worth investing in Scala and Play Framework?

                    <span>Dear r/scala,
 I am a big fan of SBT that is my main tools for debuging while coding. However, sometimes I can have like 30 errors at once. It is required to debug from first to last since the last errors may be consequent to the firsts one. In this case I have to scroll back to find the start of the error thread which I feel is a lost of time. 
 Do you know a way to reverse this error thread, so that the first errors are shown at the bottom? Or to limit the number of errors shown?
 ​
 Thx

                    <span>Hi I am looking at something similar to what other IDEs support, and that is searching for a Classes(Java, Cpp etc) within the included libraries and the project itself through maven(for Java) or Cmake (for Cpp) for example. It is clear that the language servers know about them, because they are able to properly find and import them, but i would like to be able to explicitly search for them by name (like C-x C-f).
 Is there a generic lsp feature / is that part of the spec , or each server is different in that aspect. Any help is appreciated, thanks !
 Another additional question - how does the language server access those symbols, say the Java language server, is it doing that through maven&#x27;s m2 repository or does it keep a stash on its own.

                    <span>Hi Emacs friends,
 been trying to solve this issue for quite a while now (google, posts). I swear, I did everything short of asking it here.
 Different terminal emulators as well (Terminal, iTerm2, kitty). I am on macOS.
 I would love to use my arrow keys in the non gui version of Emacs but they seem to be weirdly mapped:
 ​
 UP:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then A
 (GUI Emacs: evil-previous-line)
 
 Down:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then B
 (GUI Emacs: evil-next-line)
 
 Right:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-forward-char)
 
 Left:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-backward-char)
 ​
 ​
 I have tried few remapping by suggestions that do not work at all – currently:
 ​
 (unless (display-graphic-p)
 (progn
 (defvar arrow-keys-map (make-sparse-keymap) &quot;Keymap for arrow keys&quot;)
 (define-key esc-map &quot;O&quot; arrow-keys-map)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;A&quot; &#x27;previous-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;B&quot; &#x27;next-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;C&quot; &#x27;forward-char)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;D&quot; &#x27;backward-char)))
 ​
 Nope. Doesn&#x27;t work.
 HELP.

                    <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m trying to switch (once again, 2nd try) from my tmux, vim setup, to emacs. Mostly because I do common lisp development, but I have 2 relative big issues regarding my workflow. First, on every project I have a script that builds tmux session with corresponding services running (redis, postgresdb, vim, custom services, etc) I guess I can simulate this using a elisp file on each project? Is that possible? . Second, I use a lot M-x compile command, but my root keeps moving on each window. It&#x27;s different than vim, that the root is where I executed vim. On the other hand, SLIME is really cool, and I&#x27;m really eager to use org-mode more when I solve this 2 issues. Thank you!

                    <span>When writing Emacs Lisp programs, is it possible to automatically insert require forms?
 If not, is there an easy way to find out which ones you need to add? I have caught a bunch using elint-current-buffer, and compilation helps, but these are a bit clumsy.

                    <span>Did anyone else notice high cpu usage of emacs compiled with pgtk runing in native wayland?
 I am running it under -Q and the process go up and down at around 30/40% of a single core on a non beefy laptop even idled with no buffer open.
 I am guessing this is inherent on how wayland protocol works where emacs+pgtk spend its time doing the redrawing?

                    <span>Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I&#x27;ve started testing Embark over the past few days - and it&#x27;s already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it&#x27;s extremely useful out-of-the-box, I&#x27;ve already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can&#x27;t, because it doesn&#x27;t understand the construct at point. Examples:
  
Org mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.
 
Org mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including &quot;speed commands&quot;, most of which could work without quitting the Embark &quot;prompter&quot;, the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.
 
Org mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at &quot;rowgroup&quot;, &quot;column group&quot; and &quot;subtable&quot;, which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, &quot;eval formula&quot;, so one doesn&#x27;t have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c &#x3D;.
 
Syntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.
 
 From the looks of it, it&#x27;s not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I&#x27;m going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I&#x27;d like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any &quot;extension packages&quot; that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?

                    <span>We have all seen Emacs be described as so many different things: a text editor, not just a text editor, an operating system, a Lisp interpreter, and a *million other things.
 Describing what Emacs is can be super difficult, as it is different things to different people. Some use it for programming or general writing, some for organisation, project management, email, web browsing, controlling media, and a **million more things. Basically, people use Emacs for whatever they want, which is fantastic! 
 This makes it difficult to describe what exactly Emacs is to people outside our friendly little circle. Other editors can be described nearly completely with a short familiar phrase. Vim is an efficient text editor, VSCode is a powerful modern IDE, Vi is a last resort. But Emacs doesn&#x27;t have a consistent and universally agreeable short description. 
 My question is, what is Emacs to you? How would you describe it succinctly to someone who has heard about it, but not sure what all the fuss is about? 
 My humble submission would be: &quot;the whatever you want text interface.&quot;
 *Mild exaggeration, but you get the picture
 ** Under exaggeration :)

I tried to do a M-x customize-face for the font-lock-comment-face , and still could not get the theme to italicize my comment. Is there a way around this?

                    <span>NOTE: I usually use emacs in the CLI, not in the GUI.
 I found out about emacs some months back. When I initially tried out emacs; it felt complicated to use. After I practiced emacs over time; I started to like emacs.
  
I could use lynx inside emacs to form a psuedomultitab browser. Eventually I learned that emacs has a built-in browser eww. I favored that browser over lynx.
 
It was nice to be able to containerize workspaces, like for programming, school work, miscellaneous stuff, and just general browsing without having to deal with floating windows.
 
 I have Autism and ADHD; emacs helps with dealing with Autism, because it does not give much lack of sensory information; emacs is hyperresponsive, unlike VSCode, so it does not hurt my eyes when I try to do heavy-load tasks.
 emacs also helps with ADHD, since I can easily organize stuff with org-mode. I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can&#x27;t control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).
 EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading. That complaint is not a criticism on emacs itself though.

                    <span>Initially, I thought using hex values like #042e3a would grant me more freedom to choose the color but it turns out that apparently emacs will try to find the closest color it has when you supply a color that is not in its own color set.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I&#x27;m doing Python web development in emacs using lsp-mode(I want to switch over to eglot-mode eventually when the pull-requests get pushed and html/css/js work automatically with elgot-mode, so keep this in mind) as the IDE for the Python and HTML files, which is working great. But when doing Jinja/Django specific syntax(for example in an HTML file), the auto-completion does not work? Is there an lsp-mode/eglot-mode for this to be used with use-package?
 If not then is there a way to declare web-mode in a use-package, where this functionality can be set, in which the corresponding Jinja/Django engine is activated based on a corresponding hook?
 I&#x27;d prefer to stick with the .py and .html extensions, but if that&#x27;s not possible, the I could try out extensions like .djhtml to be used in the web-mode hook in the declared use-package.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 import Numeric.Natural 
 myNat &#x3D; -1 :: Natural
 then I try this and get
 myNat Exception: arithmetic underflow 
 no different from just
 -1 :: Natural 
 Exception: arithmetic underflow
 With the first equating Haskell seems to wait until I call myNat to say something, and then it gives what seems a cryptic error message. What&#x27;s going on under the hood here?

                    <span>File links break all the time, for instance after reorganize your directory structure. This can take many time to fix broken link manually. I need a solution to prevent all file reference in my org-agenda-files are broken.
 My current solution to prevent the issue is to use hardlink in org-agenda-files &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 assume I want add /a/b/c.org into emacs variable org-agenda-files
 mkdir ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files
 create hardlink of c.org in dir org-agenda-files
 ln /a/b/c.org ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org 
 add ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org to emacs variable org-agenda-files
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, this solution has some limit. For instance, - the absolute path of &quot;c.org&quot; become ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org. So its relative link are broken.
 LinkTek propose a much better solution: https://linktek.com/do-this-one-trick-and-never-worry-about-broken-file-links-again/
  
LinkTek creates an additional association between the parent file and each of its child files. LinkFixer Advanced uses that secondary association to quickly and automatically fix all the links that get broken by whatever changes someone makes to your files.
  
What solution you use for the problem of broken link? Exist an implementation of solution proposed by LinkTek for org mode?

                    <span>I use ebib and citar. Both are awesome, but have different defaults when creating notes files for bibliographic entries. I wanted to unify them (so that my notes would always be of the same format). So I defined a wrapper function:
 (defun my/citar-ebib-notes-format-wrapper (key _entry _filepath) &quot;Wrapper so that citar&#x27;s notes function can inherit from ebib&#x27;s. 
 Passes KEY to ebib--notes-fill-template&#x27;, along with the value ofebib--cur-db&#x27; if defined, or the first item of &#x60;ebib-preload-bib-files&#x27; if not. _ENTRY and _FILEPATH are ignored.&quot; (require &#x27;ebib-notes) (if-let ((cell (ebib--notes-create-new-note key (or ebib--cur-db (car ebib-preload-bib-files))))) (progn (display-buffer (car cell)) (goto-char (cdr cell)))))
 This only works while ebib is running. While it&#x27;s not running I get an error message format-spec: Invalid format character: ‘%T, which is strange, because the formatting seems to rely on ebib-notes-template-specifiers, which I don&#x27;t change, and which is initialised in ebib-notes.el (so should be available when the body of the function runs). Changing the notes template variable so that it doesn&#x27;t include %T helps, and iterating on this reveals that the formatter errors for all specifiers except %K, which it handles fine. I&#x27;m very confused.
 I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of to get this to work, to no avail. What&#x27;s going on? Any help greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Just today I startted getting the following errors after using straight to pull the most recent version of org.
 Error (use-package): org/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-element-cache-reset [2 times]
 Error (use-package): evil-embrace/:catch: Symbol’s value as variable is void: org-org-menu
 WARNING: No org-loaddefs.el file could be found from where org.el is loaded.
 You need to run &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make autoloads&quot; from Org lisp directory
 The only notable parts of my config related to installing org are as follows:
 (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;))) 
 and
 (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (straight-use-package &#x27;(org-contrib :type git :host github :repo &quot;emacsmirror/org-contrib&quot;)) 
 I Know there have been some recent changes with org mode installation and I have seen some posts here but I have gotten confused and can&#x27;t seem to figure out what I am doing wrong. Notably, I have not changed anything in my config lately that I would imaging would have anything to do with installing org....
 ​
 EDIT: I take it back. 
 I did recently add 
 :hook (org-mode . turn-on-org-cdlatex)
 and removing that line does seem to fix things but I have no idea why. 
 Any help would be most appreciated.

                    <span>In NixOS, I have installed emacs:
 $ emacs --version GNU Emacs 27.2 Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc. GNU Emacs comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. You may redistribute copies of GNU Emacs under the terms of the GNU General Public License. For more information about these matters, see the file named COPYING. 
 What does it mean when I start its daemon:
 $ emacs --daemon Warning: due to a long standing Gtk+ bug https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/221 Emacs might crash when run in daemon mode and the X11 connection is unexpectedly lost. Using an Emacs configured with --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid does not have this problem. Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/t/.emacs.d/init.el’: File is missing: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, go-mode-autoloads To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace. Starting Emacs daemon. 
 ?
 I also feel that ~/.emacs.d/init.el isn&#x27;t executed when I start the emacs, because I added (desktop-save-mode 1) in it, and when I exit and start emacs daemon again, it doesn&#x27;t reopen the files that were opened when I exited it.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hi!
 These are a few small scripts I use related to Emacs and Org-mode. I recently added some descriptions for each. I hope they are also useful for someone out there.
 https://github.com/psamim/dotfiles#related-to-emacs-org-mode-or-ledger-cli
 Please advise me if you have a better suggestion for any of them!
 Thanks

                    <span>Hi,
 I am a still new to emacs, and so I am not really sure what this error means.
 &#x60;forge-db: BUG: The Forge database scheme changed and there is no upgrade path&#x60;
 ​
 But I get it every time I start an application such as magit or I try to use dired for the first time.
 Thanks

                    <span>I use dired with the variable delete-by-moving-to-trash set to t. But sometimes I want to delete a file (or directory) without sending it to trash. Here is how I modified the dired-deletion-commands to toggle their trashing-behavior when called with a prefix.
 (defun my/dired-do-flagged-delete (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-flagged-delete))) (defun my/dired-do-delete (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-delete))) 
 All I have to do now is bind these functions to x and D in dired-mode-map
 Of course after that, the default reaction to prefixes is lost. Personally I don&#x27;t care, because I never used it. Others might think differently about that.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say you had to make a vanilla Emacs config and could only pick a maximum of 5 packages, not including packages distributed with emacs. Which would you choose and why?

                    <span>I am unable to get show-trailing-whitespace to work. Here is a test I did,
 emacs -q foo.txt 
 In Emacs I typed these commands,
 M-: (setq show-trailing-whitespace t) RET M-: (setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t) RET 
 Then typed 3 lines in the .txt buffer where every line contains a trailing whitespace. The trailing whitespaces do not get highlighted.
 I also checked C-h o trailing-whitespace RET and it shows that this face is set to black foreground on red background. Still I don&#x27;t see the trailing spaces highlighted in this manner.
 What is going on and how to fix it?

                    <span>Since 1.0.0 is released, people said they have hard time to get started with meow because the tutorial is not enough.
 And now we are at 1.1.0, there are some minor fixs, but for the most important
  
We have M-x meow-tutor
 
We have a WIP doom module for meow
 
 Great jobs from the contributors, we also enabled discussions.

 I have defined succ so that it can be applied to all permutation of [Letters] with a ordered sequence like this:
 succ [A,A,A] &#x3D; [A,A,B] succ [A,A,B] &#x3D; [A,A,C] succ [A,A,C] &#x3D; [A,B,A] ... succ [C,C,B] &#x3D; [C,C,C] -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined 
 build in Buildable is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:
 build A B &#x3D; [A,B] build B C &#x3D; [B,C] build A C &#x3D; [A,B,C] 
 ​
 How do I apply Buildable on [Letters] such that I can call build like this:
 build [A] [B] &#x3D; [[A],[B]] build [A,A] [B,B] &#x3D; [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]] build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] &#x3D; [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]] build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] &#x3D; [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]] 
 It seems like I have to define what maxBound and minBound is for [Letters] if I do instance Buildable [a]. How do I do that?

                    <span>I want to get back into Haskell. I used it a lot a few years ago. I just installed haskell-platform on Ubuntu which seems to be the recommended download. 
 Should I be using stack to make Haskell projects? stack wasn&#x27;t included in the haskell-platform download so is there a different workflow I should be using? I have some projects on github that I made with stack.
 Any help or other new advice would be nice

 Scala inline given unionEncoder[U]: Encoder[U] &#x3D; myMacro 
 Having the type constraint be A, B, U &lt;: A | B seems to result in any type being allowed since for any T, you can say it&#x27;s T | T. Also, yes, I can check if the type is a union in the macro, but that doesn&#x27;t stop the implicit resolution to land on unionEncoder in the first place. Any ideas?

                    <span>I’m not very familiar with scala and it’s ecosystem. Here’s the solution I envision with rust-like pseudocode.

 How do I do the same in scala? Preferably with the help of finagle infrastructure.

 jsonrpc.el looks like a useful library for this task but I can&#x27;t seem to find any examples of it&#x27;s usage in a real world application.
 There is documentation in the official manual but it isn&#x27;t particularly useful.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction or provide me a good example the would be very helpful :)

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m having an issue where emacs seems to freeze randomly on me (with no error message viewable from the GUI). It doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to a particular command (most recently it happened while I was just navigating the cursor around a buffer). Is there anything I can do / try to get a more helpful error message?
 Sorry if that&#x27;s a silly question, I&#x27;m new here.
 Some info about my setup in case it&#x27;s relevant:

                    <span>I love org-mode, but there is one thing I have always wondered: why are the default keybinds so weird? org-do-promote and its friends are by default all bound to something plus an arrow key, which completely breaks your workflow as your hand leaves the home row. I use these commands quite often, and if I had not rebound them, they would be literally the only reason I ever hit the arrow keys.
 Is there a rationale behind this?

                    <span>I have the following groceries.org: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +STARTUP: nologdone
 +FILETAGS: SHOPPING_LIST
  
Groceries :PROPERTIES: :LOGGING: nologdone :END: ** Produce *** NEXT Tomatoes &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
But only the LOGGING property in the Groceries headline works. If I remove it, the &quot;nologdone&quot; in the startup doesn&#x27;t prevent logging. 
 In a bunch of similar files I don&#x27;t need a root headline and would like to just rely on the STARTUP.
 What am I missing?

 I am a PhD student in Earth Sciences currently trying to switch all my Python programming from Spyder to emacs (because emacs is just all I need). 
 I am pretty sure more people than enough tried to make emacs as close as Spyder for me to find somewhere an el file ready to use with the Spyder theme and just the few useful things I need (basically an iPython console in another window, autocompletion, black formatting on save, cell highlighting and few other things)... However I can&#x27;t find anything. Thefore I&#x27;m pretty sure I am not looking at the right places. Do you know where I could find such a file? Or at least part of it (like the spyder theme)?
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

                    <span>TL;DR:
  
Download here: https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds/releases/tag/Emacs-28.0.90-pretest
 System Requirements: 
 macOS 10.15.x or later (uses Rosetta2 on Apple Silicon machines).
 Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS will prompt to install them on first use of native compilation).
 
 All dependencies, including libgccjit, are bundled into Emacs.app, and have been tested to work with native compilation on fresh macOS VMs with nothing installed except Xcode Command Line Tools.
 Native Apple Silicon builds are not yet available, and depend on GitHub-hosted Action runners adding Apple Silicon hardware. See Issue #4 for details. But the Intel-based builds have been reported to work fine on Apple Silicon via Rosetta2.

                    <span>I am currently using lsp-mode with Haskell in Doom Emacs. Unfortunately, when I try to open my Xmonad config in Emacs, my memory usage spikes due to the Haskell language server(takes apprx. 1.8GB) and my screen is filled with recommendations as in the image. 
 I wish to remove the gray inline requests and only keep the light-bulb requests on the right. I have looked through this page: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/ but I cannot find out how to remove the inline requests. Any help with this is greatly appreciated. I have also noticed that the inline requests are actually duplicated, which is even more confusing. 
 For the high memory usage, I don&#x27;t even know where to begin with reducing it. It&#x27;s so high that it completely eclipses the memory usage of the rest of Emacs. 
 Thanks in advance for any help

                    <span>I am a data scientist, I work in python with pandas for manipulating data on a daily basis. I love emacs but there is one feature that makes me open up Pycharm every day instead and that is its “sciview”, which displays dataframes in a “spreadsheet” manner which really helps when debugging/exploring.
 EIN has a function to do exactly this and visualize the dataframe in SES mode: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook/blob/d62dc59869d436385efa940ba20a737bb8b9e5fd/lisp/ein-pytools.el#L222 . It relies on a jupyter kernel to retrieve the data, I would like to adapt that to dap-mode (or any standard python process accessible through a REPL) but my elisp-fu is way too poor.
 Has anybody here solved this problem before?

 ELISP&gt; (cider-sync-request:complete &quot;re-frame&quot; (cider-completion-get-context) ) *** Eval error *** No linked CIDER sessions 
 in the context of this comment https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/issues/732#issuecomment-986043891 from the same ticket.
 So then, my question would be, how would link a cider session? My guess is that the (cider-completion-get-context) value isn&#x27;t returning the cider session.

                    <span>Comming to Haskell has made me feel like I&#x27;m learning to program all over again. How would you suggest is the best way to unlearn all of the habits and design patterns from imperative programming? For example whenever I work with lists I want to instinctively loop through them which of course you cannot do with Haskell.

                    <span>I&#x27;m reading through Retrocomputing with Clash. The example projects use stack to build. I&#x27;m trying to use iohk&#x27;s haskell.nix with it. For the one example project clash-calculator, when I run nix develop and it builds clash-ghc I get the following warning
 Warning: This package indirectly depends on multiple versions of the same package. This is very likely to cause a compile failure. package ghc (ghc-8.10.7) requires ghci-8.10.7 package clash-ghc (clash-ghc-1.4.6) requires ghci-8.10.7-G6m9jPL8HBD2MenaVWt4To 
 Then later there are a few errors that indicate that this warning is indeed the problem.
 How can I fix this? I could give up on the nixification of the project and just use stack, but I&#x27;d prefer not to.

                    <span>The title may not be the appropriate way of solving this issue but I feel it may be a way to the solution.
 I have a function that takes in something and returns a list of that something changed in multiple ways.
 The way it is changed is by checking the input against many if statements, the if statements only differ by the fact the values within them increment up and down. However, I don&#x27;t think this is a good solution to this.
 The way that it is changed shows a pattern so I think I should be able to solve it recursively but I can&#x27;t figure out how.
 I will give an example of a situation similar to mine, this function is useless and is just an arbitrary example of my situation:
 function :: Shape -&gt; [Shape]
 function shape@(Triangle sidea sideb sidec) &#x3D;
  [if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (7) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (2) then changeSideC shape (2) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (6) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (3) then changeSideC shape(3) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (5) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (4) then changeSideC shape (4) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (4) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (5) then changeSideC shape (5) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (3) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (6) then changeSideC shape (6) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (2) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (7) then changeSideC shape (7) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (1) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (8) then changeSideC shape (8) else Triangle [][][]]
 I have put the recurring pattern in brackets so you can see what I am talking about. How would I reduce this function down so that it would work even if you made the numbers much larger? Is there a recursive way of doing this?
 I feel that this is possible but I am at a loss on how to implement this.
 This is my first post so go easy on me if I&#x27;m missing something.

I just learned these new functions, map, filter, foldr and foldl, but i cant seem to understand when to use fold and what both of them do, in which way i want to apply them, specially with more complex functions associated, i can understand the fold (+) for example. 
 Can anyone elucidate me about these functions, im kind of stuck here.

 Also if I wanted to get an average test score from a list of tuples which had a name and their score but a person could appear more than once, how would I do that?
 Lastly, if I had a list of players and the teams they have played for, and I wanted to get a list of players that have played for every team how would I do that?

 I need to shim &#x60;UTCTime&#x60; using the &#x60;time-compat&#x60; package for older versions of GHC.
 But I don&#x27;t really want to add a new dependency for everyone else.
 Is there a way, in &#x60;stack.yaml&#x60; or &#x60;package.yaml&#x60;, that I gate a dependency for a specific GHC version?

 I do not know where to look. I am not used to asking questions here, so sorry if the format is wrong, but believe me I took my time before posting and read whatever resources I thought could be helpful.
 (I use a standard configuration, nothing fancy)

                    <span>Currently all my methods for parsing Terms are declared within the master macro, and usable only there, like so:
 def masterMacro[T:Type](quoted: Expr[T])(using Quotes) &#x3D; import quotes.reflect._ // helpers for Term level parsing object Extractors: object OnTerm: def unapply(expr: Expr[_]): Option[Term] &#x3D; Some(expr.asTerm) // etc // main macro logic 
 How do I move Extractors out of the macro? One would like something like
 // top level object Extractors(using Quotes): import quotes.reflect._ object OnTerm: def unapply(expr: Expr[_]): Option[Term] &#x3D; Some(expr.asTerm) 
 But this fails to parse with objects cannot have parameters. Dotty compiler quotes module has constructions like
 val reflect: reflectModule trait reflectModule { self: reflect.type &#x3D;&gt; 
 but I don&#x27;t understand the syntax nor whether it can be applied to what I need. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>When I&#x27;m programming in C using lsp-mode and clangd as my language server, lsp-ui-doc displays documentation like this, which is what I prefer, but it only does this if the function is defined in the file that I&#x27;m currently viewing. If I move to a different file and #include the file containing the definition, and then call the function, lsp-ui-doc ignores the docstring, which is not ideal.
 Is there a way to make lsp-ui-doc display documentation in the same way it does in the first case, everywhere? Sorry if this has been asked before, I couldn&#x27;t find anything about it while googling. Here is my settings file.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to know what you people do in these situations.
 Namely, I&#x27;d like to have coherent and consistent keybindings accross different modes, and I&#x27;d like to have this information quite visible in one place so that I can generally decide for all prog-modes or text modes what are the best keybindings for me.
 Right now I have defined a macro that kind of does this for me, a minimal example for markup languages would be
 emacs-lisp (defcustom ale-markup-mode-maps &#x27;(:org org-mode-map :latex latex-mode-map :tex TeX-mode-map :md markdown-mode-map) &quot;Maps to be added to the markup ale mode&quot; :group &#x27;ale) 
 Here I define in a plist the maps that I am interested in and the keyword is important. Later I can define the keybindings and I can override the functions for different maps according to the keywords I defined in the plist above.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (ale-define-key normal ale-markup-mode-maps &quot;C-i&quot; (:md markdown-cycle :all org-cycle) ;; images &quot;C-c C-i C-l&quot; org-latex-preview &quot;C-c C-i C-t&quot; (:all org-toggle-inline-images :md markdown-toggle-inline-images) &quot;C-c C-i C-i&quot; #&#x27;org-redisplay-inline-images
 ;; references &quot;C-c C-r C-d&quot; papis-extract-citations-into-dblock &quot;C-c C-r C-i&quot; papis-org-ref-insert-citation-from-query &quot;C-c C-r C-o&quot; (:all org-ref-insert-cite-link :tex reftex-citation :latex reftex-citation) &quot;C-c C-r C-r&quot; (:all org-ref-insert-ref-link :tex reftex-label :latex reftex-label)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 How would you do this, is there a canonical way of doing this that I am missing out?
 Just to be clear, I don&#x27;t mean defining a minor mode where to have a set of keybindings, because the keybinding will be different depending on the mode that I&#x27;m in, but if I&#x27;m in org or markdown I want semantically &#x3D;C-i&#x3D; to mean cycling, but the function is different.
 Thanks people!

                    <span>So I decided to try and use org-agenda after using it on and off for a while, and on my new setup it never seems to work. To be more elaborate, I have files added to my .emacs config, but every time I try to pull up any org-agenda view, it gives me the following error: Invalid function (date date)
 I&#x27;ve done a bit of googling and I can&#x27;t seem to find an exact answer on what this is, or what&#x27;s causing it. For reference, here&#x27;s my exact setup:
 Emacs: Version 26.3

 .emacs file: https://pastebin.com/ju2sfadG
 If anyone could help or even just point me in the right direction that would be great, thanks in advanced.

                    <span>Hi all -- I&#x27;ve put a repo on github for building emacs on macos. There are several other such scripts available, but I&#x27;ve tried to make mine as simple to understand (I&#x27;m not a programmer) as possible (or as possible for me...). It currently works well for me but YMMV. Of course, I realize that there are a million ways to shave this yak, so I&#x27;d be curious if anyone has suggestions for improvement (though I&#x27;m also looking to keep things as simple as possible). I hope this might be of some use to people.

                    <span>Hello,
 Like I&#x27;ve written in another post about Omnisharp and LSP, I&#x27;m back to trying to use Emacs as my main GUI. This is for notes, coding, etc. The reason I want to use Emacs is that I haven&#x27;t found a good GUI for nvim for Windows and I sadly have to be on Windows for my daily work. This is where Emacs comes in. I&#x27;m setting up Emacs to be close to VIM (but not using SpaceMacs or DoomEmacs since they are incredibly slow on Windows, especially compared to &quot;Vanilla Emacs&quot;), with EVIL and some other helping functions. I have some beginner questions I&#x27;d love to get help with to be happy inside of Emacs. 
 1. How can I make my .emacs file a bit cleaner instead of doing this:
 (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;tree-sitter) (package-install &#x27;tree-sitter)) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;smartparens) …</span>

                    <span>When I did my own research, I found that lsp-mode seemed to have eclipsed eglot and that it was close to the de facto LSP client for emacs. Recently, however, I have met quite a few developers that I respect who are using eglot and say that it is less buggy than lsp-mode.
 I have found that many of the bugs I have encountered while using emacs have been root caused to lsp-mode and lsp-ui. I am wondering if more experienced emacs users have an opinion on these two different packages (or sets of packages in the case of lsp-mode, dap-mode, lsp-ui). I am interested to hear about feature parity and stabability - and also using eglot when editing remote files with tramp.
 Also as an aside, it would be great to have an LSP client package added in the standard distribution of emacs.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m again (tried this before but ended up leaving this since I couldn&#x27;t get it working) trying to use Emacs as my &quot;IDE&quot;. I&#x27;m a evil user, but I don&#x27;t believe that has anything to do with my current problem. 
 I&#x27;m trying to get LSP working in emacs. Specifically Omnisharp with Unity3D. 
 I have installed lsp-mode and the Omnisharp server through the lsp-install command. When I look for the installed servers it also states that it is installed. However, when I try to use Emacs with my Unity project I get no auto-completion for anything related to Unity things (e.g. GameObject, Transform, etc.). I only get auto-completion for my own variables and such within my script. 
 I get this error message: 
 &quot;Warning (lsp-mode): Unable to calculate the languageId for buffer ‘acPlMovement.cs’. Take a look at ‘lsp-language-id-configuration’. The ‘major-mode’ is fundamental-mode&quot;
 It also says something about &quot;(Special LSP[Disconnected] company)&quot;. 
 I did read this page, but didn&#x27;t find that I should need any special setup for the omnisharp server. - https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/
 I assume I&#x27;m missing something in my setup, but I haven&#x27;t been able to google what I&#x27;m missing or what the problem could be. 
 Could anyone here help me with this? 
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>I find Haskell an amazing language but I have difficulties integrating it into my daily workflow. I work as a professional programmer and do Python all day long.
 I started the &quot;Learn you a Haskell&quot; book to tease my brain and learn to approach problems from a different angle. And I have learned a lot and I think my Python code has benefited from it.
 But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it&#x27;s still in the back of my mind to get back to it.
 However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can&#x27;t seem to find something useful to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.
 But I can&#x27;t bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).
 So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that&#x27;s not doable, a .so shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python&#x27;s ctypes module (not sure if that is even possible either).
 Any ideas? Tips?

                    <span>Hey all. I&#x27;m a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. 
 For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called &quot;composable functions&quot; (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.
 The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it&#x27;s inputs change.
 Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.
 So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!
 This is a fascinating idea to me, and I&#x27;d love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).
 I know there&#x27;s gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.
 Does anyone know of anyone who&#x27;s attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?

 readFromUrl :: String -&gt; IO String readFromUrl session -&gt; do now &lt;- getCurrentTime let expires &#x3D; addUTCTime (days 30) now cookie &#x3D; Cookie &quot;session&quot; session expires &quot;.adventofcode.com&quot; &quot;/&quot; now now False False True True jar &#x3D; createCookieJar [cookie] opts &#x3D; defaults &amp; cookies ?~ jar response &lt;- getWith opts &quot;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/input&quot; return $ Char8.unpack $ response ^. responseBody 
 I am kind of in a loss about why this doesn&#x27;t work, and the internet or documentation doesn&#x27;t seem to give me a clue about why (or what part of) my way is wrong. Could youp lease point me in the direction of a documentation that would help me?

                    <span>Excuse me, I don&#x27;t have any experience with Haskell, but I have experience with Scala and ZIO.
 Recently, there was a discussion about functional programming, and I wanted to know how I do that differs from Haskell&#x27;s.
 Best Regards

                    <span>Is there a way to set this variable in the properties or options of the file header?
 I know I can set it in file-local variables, with:
 # -*- mode: org; org-confirm-babel-evaluate: nil -*- 
 Or in a .dir-locals.el. However, when opening the file, I get prompted whether to allow setting the variable, which I don&#x27;t want. If I press ! at that prompt, to allow setting it in the future, too, it allows any file to set the variable without prompting, not just the one I opened (or others in the dame directory).
 Is there some way to set this in the file&#x27;s Org headers instead?

                    <span>Hi everyone!
I’ve been lurking for a while now but thought it was time to post and say hello. I’m a PhD student in Archaeology, and I stumbled upon the world of Zettelkasten while trying to find a better way to make notes at the start of my PhD.
I’ve jumped around quite a few different tools over the past year but there’s always been something that’s got in the way - apps were either too bloated or complicated or too buggy, or in some cases had awful font rendering.
My most recent favourite was iA Writer, and I think I was so attracted to it because I’ve learnt that I want something simple, minimal and distraction free.
For me, most options people seem to be using have too many bells and whistles and I want something that just gets out the way and leaves me with my text. iA Writer fit this bill perfectly but I found moving between notes and linking too cumbersome.
SO I’ve purchased The Archive this week and I absolutely love it! Just as minimal and “clean” but with ease of navigation built in.
I’m still in the process of getting familiar with The Archive but it seems to do everything I want it to. Before I was using subfolders but I’m thinking that I’m happy to lean in and just put all my notes in a single folder, and use tools like structure notes and other forms of hypertext to maintain connections and groupings where necessary.
The only thing I’m currently unsure of is how much to keep in my Zettelkasten. For example, my primary use case is academic writing, but I also want to keep notes relating to more personal topics of interest, e.g. notes about personal development, note taking, language-learning, etc. I’m not sure whether to combine everything or whether to keep my other interests separate.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more from you all and getting to grips with the method and The Archive in greater depth. Thanks for all the wisdom I’ve already gained from the forums!</span>

                    <span>if you build a v28 or v29 emacs using &quot;--with-native-compilation&quot;, and you load an elisp library, it is magically compiled &amp; hot-loaded into your editor (which i find *amazing*). but what about the elisp that is loaded into temacs before dumping?

                    <span>Hi, 
 I have been trying to get lsp-julia to work for a couple of days now. No go. I there anyone who has been able to make it work with the latest julia (1.7), languageserver and symbolserver installed?
 It cannot index the files. It starts up, and then crashes. I thought this is just because julia first-run is so slow. I tried vscode and lo and behold, the language server spun up instantly :( 
 Any help/tips/suggestions?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to emacs and lots of the terminology and understanding for it is nooby.
 I was wondering if someone could in baby terms guide me how I can do the following:
 ​
 a) Write and save a text file
 b) Open an application
 c) Open a .mp3
 d) Open a folder
 e) Set a macro on my keyboard to open a specified application
 ​
 Thank-you in advance

                    <span>I&#x27;d like the grep buffer not to scroll/move the current line to the top of the buffer/screen when i press enter. I&#x27;ve tracked the issue down to &#x60;compile-goto-error&#x60; and then &#x60;next-error-internal&#x60; in simple.el, but I can&#x27;t seem to find the relevant code. I&#x27;ve tried a few configuration options, including &#x60;next-error-recenter&#x60; (which seems to just stop recentering/scrolling on the destination buffer) but can&#x27;t seem to figure it out.
 Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>I have been mostly happy keeping no emacs custom-file using Drew Adams&#x27; cus-edit+. This means that all my customization is kept in my use-package statements, so it is fully reproducible. The only downside in my year+ of doing this has been that sometimes I get warnings or &quot;buttons&quot; in messages that pop up, such as &quot;disable showing&quot; in a pop-up warning, and I don&#x27;t know how to &quot;disable&quot; it permanently. Normally it would put a line into my custom file and I could use that to update my :custom sections in my init.el. Now, though, it saves it in running &quot;state&quot; if I click the (eg) &quot;Disable showing&quot; button, but I have no idea what I should write to make it permanently remember not to show that thing.
 Any solutions? How can maintain no custom file, but still capture the code that would be written by interface interactions like errors &quot;disable showing&quot;, or certain customizer settings, etc?

                    <span>Hi, I was recently playin with the docker package from this page - https://github.com/Silex/docker.el Which I think is using docker tramp. But i am unable to work around a very annoying problem. When i try to trigger the exec command, it constantly throws a warning or error. Attached shots below. I am quite confused and was unable to find any solution online, actually noone seems to have had this problem ?

 docker exec -it keycloak sh &amp;&amp; extit || exit the input device is not a TTy. If you are using mintty try prefixing the command with &#x60;winpty&#x60; helm-M-x-execute-command: Tramp failed to connect. If this happens repeatedly, try &#x60;M-x tramp-cleanup-this-connection&#x60;

                    <span>having trouble with org-journal and org-agenda - 
 I configured org-journal-carryover-items to carry over all except those marked DONE . This carryover happens at file-creation time for the next day. 
 If I schedule something in an org-journal entry for a date in the future, the file is created. But there are no carryover items at the time. 
 When items do carry over, the file is already created, so they don’t get added to the existing file.
 ​
 How do I fix this?
 ​
 Doom emacs

 I use Conan package manager for manage my external libraries which locate in &#x60;~/.conan/data&#x60;. I am currently using Spacesmacs and wonder how I can add that folder to to syntax checking. I added this hook to the user-config:
 (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq flycheck-clang-include-path (list (expand-file-name &quot;~/.conan/data/&quot;))))) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work... Can you advice me how to include certain dir to path?
 Also I use &#x60;lsp-clangd&#x60; backend.. Maybe something to be set there?

For example, these two features are missing: - Highlighting of cited text with different cases. - The ability to display attachments in a buffer using gnus-mime-copy-part.
 Is there a way to configure notmuch to have this gnus functionality?

 Per the documentation for format-time-string that says that %n is a newline, I tried adding %n to org-agenda-format-date-aligned as well as to org-super-agenda-date-format, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick. Any ideas? Much appreciated!

                    <span>You&#x27;ve almost certainly all heard this sentence before. As a new Emacs user and someone who does want to really get to know Emacs, I want to hear about all the pros and cons I have heard so far, from you guys. I&#x27;m really surprised how friendly this community is. I&#x27;ve never seen a more friendly online group ever. 
 I am the guy that asked about &quot;Emacs-Lisp functions beneath the surface&quot; a few days ago. 
 Anyway, I was watching this video and there is something that caught my attention more than anything else. And that is the sentence at 14:00 : 
  
&quot; Emacs is 12 MB, core with none of the Lisp extensions.&quot; 
  
Is this really true? Why is Emacs considered a bloat Software, in some communities, then? 12 MB doesn&#x27;t seem much. 
 And what do people mean when they say that Emacs is bloat or memory intensive? Is the core bloated?
 There are definitely people that are more for debating than actually addressing problems or having a discussion. So I&#x27;m really curious, is it that there is actually a real reason they are saying it, or is it just that it&#x27;s a common &quot;saying&quot; of Vim users and users who find Emacs &quot;too difficult&quot;? 
 Or is it that an average user uses so many packages that Emacs becomes CPU and/or memory intensive? 
 What do you consider a bloat software?
 Also, even the guy in the video said that at 18:20: 
  
&quot;All these things that people have said about Emacs having a big footprint and being memory intensive blah blah blah it&#x27;s all true&quot; 
  
I would love to hear your perspective on this commonly brought up &quot;contention&quot;.

                    <span>Hi there. I&#x27;m a recent Emacs convert using Spacemacs. I was wondering if anyone else is using Emacs to write Python 3.10 code, specifically using the new match and case keywords. When I try to use them, Emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize them as keywords, and so doesn&#x27;t understand that it should indent the following lines.
 If I understand correctly, this is handled by python.el. Has there been any movement on adding support for the new keywords? And where could I go to find out, follow progress, or possibly contribute?
 For reference, I&#x27;m using Emacs 27.2 and the built-in python.el. Thank you!

                    <span>I find Emacs&#x27; scroll down C-v and up M-v a little jarring. I duckduckgoed (went?) around and found golden-ratio-scroll-screen but it didn&#x27;t scroll 62% of the screen, as the README claims it to do -- in fact it overshot by a bit. As I don&#x27;t have the time to debug it right now, what recommendations do you have to scroll half a page up or down on Emacs?

                    <span>My ultimate goal is to parse function and class/type signatures and add comment documentation stubs, think doxygen. I am starting with Python and hopefully implement it for other languages when I successfully implement this. The parser part is easy, but the problem is that most of the file is not relevant and I want to ignore it. Is there way to jump to the part of the file/text that is potentially parseable or is relevant to the task.
  There is some text that I don&#x27;t care about... ...  ... Maybe more irrelevant text. 
 I tried using getPosition and setPosition but it didn&#x27;t behave like I expected, maybe I am using them wrong?
 Any advice would be appreciated.
  
EDIT: I am using parsec for parsing.

                    <span>I know this code is garbage, but basically I&#x27;m trying to implement a safe (maybe) Int division function. I have to use both recursion &amp; guards, so this is what I came up with. The problem now is that somehow the just (negate count) in the test&#x27; function doesn&#x27;t work (it always returns the result as positive, eg dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; (-100) 10 is always Just 10) - and I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why. I checked that the test&#x27; function does indeed get called, I triple checked my guards etc. Any help would be much appreciated :)
 dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Maybe Int dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; num denom | denom &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; Nothing | num  0 &#x3D; test&#x27; (negate num) denom 0 | num &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; denom  0 &amp;&amp; denom &gt; 0 &#x3D; go num denom 0 where go n d count | n &lt; d &#x3D; Just count | otherwise &#x3D; go (n - d) d (count + 1) test&#x27; n d count | n &lt; d &#x3D; Just (negate count) -- why does this not work?? ffs | otherwise &#x3D; go (n - d) d (count + 1)

                    <span>A question about ghcup. I&#x27;ve used that to install a recent version of GHC (9.0.1), alongside the one from the Ubuntu repos (8.8.something). Ghcup also installed Cabal 3.6 for me.
 How do I persude my OS and/or Cabal to use the version of GHC installed by ghcup, and not one from Ubuntu? 
 I resorted to added some manual links into ~/.ghcup/bin, pointing to the GHC binaries I want, but that can&#x27;t be the way to do it properly.

                    <span>Dear all
 We are thrilled to announce the release of Ogma, a new open-source NASA tool, written in Haskell, to generate hard-realtime C runtime monitoring applications from high-level specifications.
 Ogma takes the output of existing tools, like NASA&#x27;s requirements elicitation tool FRET [2], and produces monitors in Copilot [3], a runtime verification language that can be compiled to hard-realtime C99.
 Ogma is also able to produce monitoring applications for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System (cFS), which can be compiled alongside existing applications to flag requirement violations. 
 FRET requirement being monitored inside the XPlane flight simulator by taking the code generated by Ogma and making it accessible to the simualtor via a custom on-screen plugin
 Ogma takes high-level specifications produced from requirements by NASA&#x27;s FRET tool and converts them into Copilot runtime monitors that can be converted into hard-realtime C99 code.
 This is research software (Class E) and it has not been certified for use in aircraft or UAVs. We are currently using it for upcoming experiments at NASA Langley.
 We&#x27;d like to also take this opportunity to publicly thank the team that creates BNFC, for their tool, their response to technical questions during the development of Ogma, and for accommodations made to help us speed up our release process.
 If you have any issues, feel free to open a ticket in the github repo directly.
 Happy haskelling,

                    <span>I re-registered for a masters of CS program because my BCS was completed at a relatively unknown Canadian school so I am always wondering if &quot;I know less&quot; than others in important areas like distributed computing on which I have almost no knowledge. I know the masters program uses languages like C, C++, Java, Python, etc so I&#x27;m wondering how much of a gap I&#x27;ll be left with to transfer the knowledge I gain to implementing in Haskell. Is there a better roadmap to learning more advanced topics and applying them in Haskell or other pure functional languages than enrolling in a masters program? It&#x27;s fully online so courses only, no thesis. Should I get a job doing something within reach and self-study these concepts and trying to implement in Haskell? I&#x27;m still a novice in Hasekll but feel as though I&#x27;m falling behind already as the trend towards pure functional languages seems to be accelerating. Should I try to enroll in a graduate program that is focused on functional languages like the one at Tsukuba University?

                    <span>One of the biggest problem is the difficulty using programming tool on the code, because the code is wrapped in org file, programming tools can&#x27;t access to code.
 In order to integrate org babel code to programming tools ecosystem. 2 possible solutions: - import/export solution, like myuhe/org-gcal.el. For instance, we compile org file to .java, and recompile .java to .org. But this solution has a lot of drawbacks. When recompile .java to .org, a new org file is generated by the compiler, we lose the data organization, and all the info that are not exported of original org file. - bi-directional synchronisation solution like dengste/org-caldav. For instance, only code block of org file is exported to .java file, and all modification on java file will repercut on org code block. This is the best solution for the problem.
 However, I don&#x27;t see either of the 2 solutions used in the org mode literary programming tutorials. But they are used to integrate org agenda to another calendar ecosystem. Is there a reason?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the new org-cite engine to write my dissertation. It works well except that when exporting to ODT or even Org-mode with chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl as the CSL style I get a reference without date. So for citation [cite:@fabianTimeOtherHow2014 p. 7;] I get:
 For ODT 
  
[1]Johannes Fabian, Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7
  
for Org-mode
  
[fn::Johannes Fabian, /Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object/ (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7]
  
As you can see, in both cases the date is missing. As per this reply to this issue on citeproc-org&#x27;s Github it seems that the date field is not a recognized bibtex field. If I change manually in my .bib file a particular entry from date to year then I do get the correct reference.
 My question is: how can I solve this issue without changing the date field of all the entries in my .bib file to year?
 This is what I have at the top of my org file:
 #+CSL_STYLE: ~/Zotero/styles/chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: /Users/name/Documents/dissertation/zotero_full.bib

                    <span>I read https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/conversions.html and I&#x27;m left with some questions. In Scala 2, we create a companion object, e.g.,
 object Fraction { def IntToFraction(n: Int): Fraction &#x3D; Fraction(n) } class Fraction(numer: Int, demon: Int &#x3D; 1) { private val gcd &#x3D; // TODO: Calculate GCD(numer, denom) val numerator &#x3D; numer / gcd val denominator &#x3D; denom / gcd def apply def +(addend:Fraction) // etc. } 
 Is a companion object unnecessary in Scala 3?
 I could just try it on my other computer as I have Scala 3 on that one, but I would still appreciate some pointers on this.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a Java and Groovy dev and I picked a Scala2/Spark position for my next job as I was very attracted to all I heard about the language. I figured it would be a great way for me to generally become a better programmer, fast.
 Now though, I need to kick things into high gear. I have roughly three months of afterwork evenings and weekends to really get going with Scala before I have to code in front of my peers.
 Would any of you have pointers as to where to start? Books, online lectures, exercise websites? I&#x27;ll take anything!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I am the guy wants to be a professional programmer of scala and I really hope that many people use scala. I know scala came out with a like motto that covers both oop and fp paradigm. Yeap functional programming is really good and that is the target to achieve to scala learners. Functional programming style sounds good. So can all of you know zio? Except for beginners anyone who like functional programming style have to know zio. Why? This library is main stream these days. Many people really like zio. I agree zio is a great library. So what? If you decided you became a scala programmer you have to learn elementary grammar and functional programming style and library like zio. Why does the guy wants to use scala like me have to know all of those? Is this language for someone who is smart and for elite?

                    <span>I have a method A calling method B.
 A { Try{ calling B } match { case Success(_) ... case Failure(e) ... }
 B is returning Failure (exception) like
 def B: Try[Unit] &#x3D;&gt; { Failure(exception) }
 This is going inside the Success block of A, any idea why?

                    <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Assessing Haskell by Nyeogmi
I considered trying to assess Haskell without mentioning my own opinions at all. I don’t think that’s fair or possible, nor do I think that would lead people to an accurate assessment of Haskell.
Fallback of actions by Magnus Therning
In a tool I’m writing I want to load a file that may reside on the local disk, but if it isn’t there I want to fetch it from the web. Basically it’s very similar to having a cache and dealing with a miss, except in my case I don’t populate the cache.

 (possible to mirror some github repos onto local git server).

                    <span>Evaluating (window-text-width) for a fullscreen window returns 238, which indicates that 238 columns of characters should be able to be displayed on one line. However, using count-words-region, I can see that I can actually only fit 234 characters on a line without it causing wrapping (I&#x27;m using global-visual-line-mode, although this problem persists when it&#x27;s off). This causes problems with any functionality that tries to right align content - for instance, org-agenda will try to align content so that the last character in a heading&#x27;s tags is on column 238 (i.e. on the right side of the screen), but since column 238 is actually beyond the right side of the screen, the tags end up on the following visual line. Instead of
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 I end up with
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 ...which is significantly less information dense and generally uglier. I was content to set org-agenda-tags-column to 0, but I&#x27;ve recently picked up ledger, and this issue has also started messing up the formatting in its reports. This also happens regardless of how I split windows - if I split vertically, window-text-width reports a width of 118, but I can actually only fit 114 columns. Has anyone run into this before, or have tips for where to start looking? This seems like such a finicky, low-level thing I don&#x27;t have much hope - especially since I haven&#x27;t futzed around with any obvious culprits like font settings.

                    <span>Hi, On my work ( windows)laptop. Due to needing service desk to install most software. I find it easier just ssh’ing into a Linux cloud vm in that this allows me to install whatever I need. So thats good but then I’m in emacs (spacemacs ) terminal not GUI. 
 The reason I ask is that terminal only , there are problems displaying graphics e.g. matplotlib plots. So my workaround for this is Jupyter lab: jupyter lab --ip&#x3D;0.0.0.0 --port&#x3D;9090. My question is… is there any way to view plots in emacs given my setup? I’d prefer to have freedom to use emacs org mode and render plots than be forced to use Jupiter lab notebooks .
 Does anybody know, if possible, how I can display images in emacs using cloud vm?
 Thanks

                    <span>I am unable to successfully utilize the pdf-tools package.
 Environment:
  
macOS Monterey 12.0.1
 Emacs 27.2
  
To the best of my understanding, I have followed the installation instructions as outline on https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools:
  
I&#x27;ve installed and confirmed that the installations of poppler and automak are up-to-date
 Though it doesn&#x27;t seem to be required for the MacOS install, I&#x27;ve installed and confirmed that the installations of gcc and glib are up-to-date.
 I&#x27;ve set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH in the init.el file using setenv and confirmed its settings using getenv
  
​
 (setenv &quot;PKG_CONFIG_PATH&quot; &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.8/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig&quot;) 
 When I try to execute pdf-tools-install and select y in response to the question &quot;Need to (re)build the epdfinfo program, do it now?&quot; I get a compilation error which reads:
 ​

                    <span>Hi,I work on project that need to be build inside docker. Not all headers are available outside. I can extract them but way better will be if I it will be not needed.
 To build project I run : sudo docker .... make -f Makefile.custom
 Can I use that flycheck or any other code checker to see my mistakes while coding?

 I use some commands that have a habit of splitting my windows, like magit or C-x p s to open a shell. I find this annoying and would prefer the default behaviour to open the command in the currently active window instead.
 Does anyone know how to do that?

                    <span>New emacs user here, I&#x27;m having trouble with color themes. I use M-x to install via package-installer and M-x to load theme. 
 Spacemacs dark and light look fine but everything else results in some weird mixing of themes:
 https://i.postimg.cc/dQRMszqK/Screen-Shot-2021-12-02-at-1-10-30-AM.png
 https://i.postimg.cc/FRRfrjLM/Screen-Shot-2021-12-02-at-1-16-38-AM.png
 What is the proper procedure to install themes? A post on stackoverflow mentions the need to disable themes before applying a new theme. Trying this sometimes works and sometimes does not. It does change the mixing but there is still mixing
 A similar thing happens when I tried to use powerline smart mode line.
 Here&#x27;s my init.el. Running emacs 27.2 (9.0) on MacOS Catalina 10.15.4
 https://i.postimg.cc/gjH1g6M0/Screen-Shot-2021-12-02-at-1-06-54-AM.png
 All I have added is the Melpa package installer snippet. Any help is much appreciated!

 I ran across context.vim https://github.com/wellle/context.vim, which is basically a sticky header, where your cursor is.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anybody knows, if there is a package for Emacs as well, which has the same, or similar behavior.

 ​
 I want to put a condition in my .emacs to check if it is xwidget compiled emacs, I want to use a certain package like mu4e-views. Otherwise, I want to skip it.

                    <span>So i have been researching Cardano for a few months and was curious about the haskell programming that it uses for Dapps.
 What do you think about Cardano using haskell programming?
 What do you think about Cardano the project itself?
 Any intresting projects you working on?
 Thanks for the read!

                    <span>Given this program, main.hs  import System.IO main :: IO () main &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [getLine] head xs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn head xs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn  I was surprised to find this output:
  echo -e &quot;1\n2&quot; | runghc main.hs 2&gt;/dev/null 1 2  (instead of 1\n1\n).
 Does this happen because IO String is a monad around a reader handle (stdin in this case), and so multiple binds on the same value cause successive reads on the handle?

                    <span>What to call these? Patterns like Ap themselves follow a meta-pattern which specifies applicative lifting where the operations all have the form opn &#x3D; liftAn opn.. give or take lifting constants. Assume simplified classes and liftA0 &#x3D; pure
 instance (Applicative f, Semigroup a) &#x3D;&gt; Semigroup (Ap f a) where () &#x3D; liftA2 () instance (Applicative f, Monoid a) &#x3D;&gt; Monoid (Ap f a) where mempty &#x3D; liftA0 mempty instance (Applicative f, Bounded a) &#x3D;&gt; Bounded (Ap f a) where minBound &#x3D; liftA0 minBound maxBound &#x3D; liftA0 maxBound instance (Applicative f, Num a) &#x3D;&gt; Num (Ap f a) where (+) &#x3D; liftA2 (+) (-) &#x3D; liftA2 (-) (*) &#x3D; liftA2 (*) abs &#x3D; liftA abs .. fromInteger &#x3D; liftA0 . fromInteger 
 The pattern is somewhat simple but with no way to capture it, except by repeating it for every algebra. The instance head cannot be a type variable
 instance (Applicative f, cls a) &#x3D;&gt; cls (Ap f a) where ?? 
 What would such a solution even look like? I don&#x27;t want to get distracted by if the instance are all lawful, just capturing this meta-pattern the emerges. 
  
A generic representation for type classes to parallel Generic for datatypes. 
 It can be implemented as a GHC plugin, like Evoke (blog, reddit, reddit)
 
Or created on the fly by GHC, which is privy to the internal structure of type classes
 instance (Applicative f, cls a) &#x3D;&gt; cls (Stocking1 Ap f a)

 I maneged to download all the other extension he was asking for but can&#x27;t download the language server. In the VS&#x27;s marketplace it is literally just not there. What can I do?

 so I tried putting &#x60;or&#x60; there instead but I just get another error.
 Am I missing an import?
 At the top of my file I have
 import Data.List import qualified Data.Map as M import Data.Maybe 
 and I swear I have been following the book line by line so did not miss any other imports.

                    <span>Morning org-fans,
 I have been asked for the PDF of my org-reveal presentation.
 I&#x27;m aware I can use the:
 ?print-pdf 
 and
 Ctrl+P 
 Method in my browser to generate a PDF, but that doesn&#x27;t do what I need.
 It doesn&#x27;t retain the formatting of the presentation. It simply displays a small amount of black text on a white blank page. This looks unprofessional and is hard to read.
 Am I missing something obvious here?

                    <span>Hi all, is anyone using org-ql with a big number of files, probably in combination with org-roam, instead of say deft? How well does it scale to thousands of files? I know that org-agenda can get pretty sluggish around a thousand files, but it&#x27;s my understanding that org-ql is faster, although maybe not that faster. Any experience? Thanks!
 NOTE: this is not for TODOs but for general search, I&#x27;ve seen workarounds that exclude files not containing tasks nor projects from the search, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m interested in, I want to search every file and ideally using more structured queries like those of org-ql (vs deft).
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve been experimenting a bit with this:
  
I cloned this big nonsense ZK which is designed to stress-test note-taking apps.
 I converted all notes from md to org using pandoc: for f in *; do pandoc --to org &quot;$f&quot; &gt; &quot;${f%%.md}.org&quot;; done. Not really necessary for what it follows, except for the file extension part, but anyway.
 Now, searching for some text with ripgrep is very fast, as expected, for example with 56/10000 matches:
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
time rg -c &quot;to queer noises&quot; *.org | wc -l 56
  
real 0m0.317s user 0m0.195s sys 0m0.316s &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
Now with org-ql the same search setting org-directory to be the ZK folder, requiring no grouping and just random order, and doing a (regexp &quot;to queer noises&quot;) freezes, at least I&#x27;ve been waiting for minutes now for it to end. Repeating the search in a subset of that ZK with just a few hundred notes, it ends after some seconds, but it&#x27;s still borderline usable.
  
So I guess the answer is a sound NO, org-ql can&#x27;t be reasonably used in a setup like this one. u/github-alphapapa do you have any objection to my methodology here? Thanks!
 EDIT: deft has also been terribly sluggish with this same ZK, both in generating the deft buffer and in searching through it, so the best option seems to be something like consult-ripgrep.

                    <span>So most of my work, I have used hell lot of JavaScript and Python and a littlebit of TypeScript. In my new Job, I am supposed to learn Scala and I already had a hard time understanding Generics and all such concepts. Additionally the functional way of Scala, stuff like accumulator based recursion and tail recursion, lazy variables also got my head spinning.
 I am planning to Dive even deeper into this but I wanted to know from all of you that should I rather go and learn Java or TypeScript in depth before going to Scala? Actually I don&#x27;t have a lot of time grasping all of the concepts and so I began with basics of Scala and till now my experience is neither too good nor too bad.
 ​
 As of 2021 (or we can say almost 2022), what would be your advise for a beginer with statically typed language and how should I go about learning Scala so that I get a good grip in it?
 ​
 Additionally, when we say Java there are two things: 1. Pure Programming Side of Java, 2. JVM and of-course here I am not referring to the JVM side as I understand, since Scala anyways runs on JVM, that&#x27;s a necessary thing. What I need to know is that do you need to go through Java Programming or any such language before getting Scala really well?

                    <span>Although the feature is still marked as experimental, the release of Nix 2.4 marks the entry of content-addressed derivations in a released Nix version.
This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you haven’t done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), …</span>

                    <span>For those using emacs, this will mimic an interesting Scrivener feature. The Keyboard Maestro macro will change the desktop image from a list and, if Emacs is running at the front, it will (optionally) also set a corresponding theme at your choice.
You can configure the list using the following format:
Full path:Some description:spacemacs-theme

The image above displays text in olivetti-mode, using the great iA Writer Duospace font.
And this is the macro (I bind it to ^⌘J D):

If you need to Hide/Show Desktop Icons, you may use this script:
try
    set CurSet to do shell script &quot;defaults read com.apple.finder CreateDesktop&quot;
    on error
    set CurSet to &quot;1&quot;
 end try
 if CurSet is &quot;1&quot; then
    set NewSet to false
else
    set NewSet to true
end if
do shell script &quot;defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool &quot; &amp; NewSet
tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
    quit
    try
        activate
    end try

What do you do when your Zettelkasten is a mess ? I started building a Zettelkasten in Obisidan  a couple of months ago and finally ended up with a confusing web of notes.
Do you start from scratch, or do you continue with what you have, while refining your approach to Luhmann&#x27;s method ?</span>

 Stumbled upon interesting blog post about avy with examples / screenshots. Thought it will be useful to some of your guys.
 Link to article.
 tldr:
 To perform task we 1 Filter &gt; 2 Select &gt; 3 Act
 The stated purpose of Avy, jumping to things, makes it sound like a (contextually) faster Isearch. But jumping is only one of many possibilities. Avy&#x27;s &quot;Act&quot; part (“dispatch list”, a collection of actions you can perform on a candidate) is where it truly shines.

                    <span>Curious about people&#x27;s use of Org agenda. I initially was really enamored by the idea of using one system for notes, writing, and task, time, and project management, but found Org-agenda a bit too clunky and requiring too much thinking about how to set it up rather than using it. 
 I&#x27;m interested in developing some more Org-centric apps in the future, and was wondering whether a note-focused Org app would be used at all if people heavily relied on TODOs and such sprinkled within their notes. Personally I think a separate application (possibly also utilizing Org-mode) for such things would be better, but that&#x27;s just me!
 Let me know your workflows!

                    <span>I just randomly did &quot;M-x notes&quot; and the auto completes showed something called org-add-notes! I thought this is something similar to remember-notes, and immediately decided to write a note using this. I did that a few more times and stored them with C-c C-c.
 Now the problem is I don&#x27;t know where to get them! Where are they stored? I have not set this up in any way in my init.el. I didn&#x27;t even know about the existence of this command a few minutes ago.
 The documentation of this command does not give me any hints. Also, directly searching through org-mode info command index does not give anything. I can see the code for this in org.el but I am not a pro in elisp code reading and cannot figure out where exactly my notes are being saved.
 I do have the feeling from the code that this is actually not similar to remember-notes but perhaps has something to do with adding comments/notes to any org file item... but I may have understood wrong.

 Lately i have been furstrated my my c++ IDE at work. I tried rtags a few years back but it crashed frequently. When checking the state of things recently I noticed LSP was getting big so I decided to give it a try to switch full time. I installed a few more packages like lsp, helm (love it). I even read the beginner&#x27;s elisp intro to understand its syntax.
 That&#x27;s when the rabbit hole started and i read about spacemacs and doom emacs
 *** doom/spacemacs : an overwhelming layer *** I get the reason for those distributions : having a curated set of packages preconfigured to work together + load time optimisations for an out of the box working experience. (+vim like experience for those who like it) 
 My issue was that after installing i did not know where to start. These 100+ packages must be worth learning right ? I expected a kind of interactive walkthrough like emacs&#x27;s own tutorial but ended up on the web documentation instead, which was also overwhelming.
 I wonder how people who have never used emacs/vim can get started easily on this. Do they use only 1% of the available features ? Is there a master tutorial somewhere that i missed ? 
 And for people who like tinkering/debugging with their config to have exactly what they want, i find it much easier on a minimalistic example than when 100+ plugins are involved.
 ** who are those distributions for ? *** I have the feeling that beginners would be better off with a simple config with discoverability improvements like which-key/helm
 And for seasoned user who like tinkering with the defaults, i find that building your config helps you understand how to use the plugin you&#x27;re using
 So fellow doom/space users, what made you jump on that train ? How did you get to &quot;master&quot; this complex environment ? 
 Cheers

                    <span>Hi,
 I recently discovered power of literate devops concept and for many cases it works great but I have problem with completion if I am connected to remote server over SSH (but not TRAMP but in Org babel session).
 E.g.:
 #+begin_src sh :session server ssh server1 #+end_src 
 C-c C-c to evaluate code block to establish SSH connection with server1 creates a shell buffer with the same name. Now C-x b, switch to that buffer in shell major mode and bash completion doesn&#x27;t work properly. It means if I want to cd /etc/ and the press TAB twice it doesn&#x27;t prompts content of /etc directory of my remote machine but my local. If I want correct completion of remote shell I have to use TRAMP session. Does anyone fix that problem and found workaround? Babel shell sessions are more comfortable for me.

                    <span>I think I have my terminology correct. I&#x27;m using Spacemacs but I don&#x27;t think that matters.
 When I invoke dired, helm wants to know which directory I want. It shows the current directory as a starting point. My question is how to edit this input. C-a takes me to the beginning of the line. C-S backspace clears the line, but how would I delete a word at a time? I&#x27;m currently backspacing a character at a time and that&#x27;s just annoying.

                    <span>Hi, I want to make two customizations to lsp-ui-imenu, when using python + pyright. First, running lsp-ui-imenu returns function names as well as all variables. I want it to return only function name so that I can jump to the top easily when using consult-imenu. I have looked into filtering this list in the source code but haven&#x27;t found how to do it. Second, is there a way for lsp-ui-imenu to show entries from the entire git-repo? It would be amazing if I could use this to jump between files, rather than having to first open the correct file then searching for the function name.
 Any help or pointers appreciated!

                    <span>Thought to write a post here before asking in the ivy github repo.
 I use ivy-switch-buffer bound to C-x b to switch to another buffer. Is it possible to assign numbers to the buffers so that pressing a number from the buffer list will automatically switch to that buffer? This will save a few keystrokes compared to moving up and down / fuzzy search for the buffer name and then press Enter.

                    <span>Hi everyone, has anybody found a trick to prevent Firefox/Chrome to not do anything when pressing Ctrl+n, Ctrl+p, etc.? I use Overleaf to write LaTeX documents online and even though I already selected in the menu of Overleaf to use Emacs keybindings, every time I press Ctrl+n Firefox or Chrome is opening a new browsing window, very annoying.
 Any workarounds on this?

                    <span>Ok, so, today I decided to learn abbrev. After wrestling a couple of minutes with the abbrev file because I&#x27;m using chemacs2, I finally defined an abbrev, and it worked. Well, kinda worked.
 It seems that if I type out the abbrev really quickly and press M-&#x27;, then it works, but inserts a dash after the needed expansion. If I type it out slowly, and then press M-&#x27;, it just places the dash after the thing that I need to expand. Then, if I quickly typed the thing and expanded it with M-&#x27;, I can expand it second time if I type it out and press C-x &#x27;. If I JUST type it out and press C-x &#x27;, nothing happens. I also tried doing it using hippie-expand, and it works, on the second time, printing &quot;Using try-expand-all-abbrevs&quot; in the echo area.
 I tried doing the same thing with completely clean emacs config (emacs -Q), and the results are the same. My version of emacs is 28.0.50. What am I doing wrong?

 It now works only with one private leaderboard, user ID and session ID must be set before running major mode.
 Things like global leaderboard, multiple private leaderboards, viewing tasks, fetching task inputs and posting results are planned.

 I&#x27;ve been curious how Haskell devs write Rust code. Do they try to make Rust look &amp; feel more like Haskell by using certain libraries? How do they cope with lack of monads, type classes, HKTs and such?
 Edit Additional question(s): - How do you handle effects? The imperative way?

                    <span>I followed the discussion in a recent thread about people handling effects in Haskell. Many people seem to rely on a combination of some environment and IO, in one way or another (RIO, ReaderT env IO, IO + explicitly passing some environment, Handle Pattern, record-of-functions in the environment, ...).
 I am currently experimenting with a slightly different approach and I am quite happy with the results so far. More concretely, instead of combining an environment with IO, we can combine it with a continuation-based version of IO (aka ContT/Codensity/Managed) like ...
 newtype Program e a &#x3D; Program (e -&gt; forall b. (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; IO b) 
 ... with instances for Applicative, Functor, Monad, MonadIO, etc. One can read the type as &quot;a program running with an environment of type e and producing a…</span>

                    <span>Is there any way to add a custom preamble for org-latex-preview? I want to be able to preview commands that I&#x27;ve defined in LaTeX, right now any commands that it doesn&#x27;t recognize just show up as blank.
 As a backup, is there any way to disable preview for undefined commands (i.e. show the LaTeX code), instead of just showing a blank?

                    <span>In org-roam I use an underscore in the generated ID.
 :PROPERTIES: :ID: 20211201_152904 :END: 
 However, the part after the underscore is rendered as subscript hanging off the baseline in smaller font size. How can I prevent this formatting, so it looks like the above?

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve posted this on r/functionalprogramming. In short: I&#x27;m not smart enough for Haskell, so I&#x27;m looking for other alternatives where immutability and pure functions are, if not mandatory, at least encouraged.
 In just a few days I hopped to Elm, Ocaml, back to Typescript and, finally, there and back again to Javascript(is programming-language hopping a thing?), after this book got me excited to give it a try. After reaching to chapter 8 with a certain hopelessness regarding (lack of) types, I ended up to this article with quite strong arguments against using JS if you want strong typing and functional proogramming facilities (&quot;Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two&quot;). The article mentioned PureScript and here I am. From Haskell syntax to strong typing, the language seems to have everything I&#x27;m looking for mentioned right at its home page.
 While learning Haskell, I liked pretty much almost everything. I really, really liked its syntax, the ways we can define types and type classes, its simplicity, and I think it was relatively easy to learn that. What got me really overburdened was how to &quot;change states&quot; and IO. From that point of view, is there something along the way that disapoint me?
 EDIT: this is being helpful: https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md

                    <span>Hi! I have the following, combining inline match and default argument:
 inline def func(myArg: (Int | String) &#x3D; 0) &#x3D; inline myArg match case i: Int &#x3D;&gt; () case s: String &#x3D;&gt; () 
 It works fine when called so that the default value is not used:
 // works fine func(1) 
 However, when the value is used, it fails to compile:
 // fails func() 
 with
 [error] |cannot reduce inline match with [error] | scrutinee: myArg$proxy1 : (myArg$proxy1 : (Int | String) @uncheckedVariance) [error] | patterns : case i @ _:Int [error] | case s @ _:String 
 Apparently the default value is a method that is not inlined. Is there a way around this?
