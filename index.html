                    <span>Org mode&#x27;s manual appears to be published into a series of separate HTML files, ordered hierarchically, and nicely linked with options like &quot;Up,&quot; &quot;Next,&quot; etc...
 I can see from org&#x27;s source code that the manual is in fact one big .org file.
 How do I configure org&#x27;s publishing options to make my big .org file into many files, like org&#x27;s manual?
 EDIT 1: It seems that the manual is made with Texinfo (texi). Now my question is: how can I best go from .org -&gt; texi -&gt; the html format I see in the docs?
 EDIT 2: I found my answer. First, export from org to texi.
 Then, use makeinfo to build the html. For example: makeinfo --no-validate --force book.texi --html -o book
 The command above will produce a directory called book/ containing an index.html, with each heading a separate HTML file.
 I should be able to take it from here with org publishing configuration. Thanks all for the help.

                    <span>In my LaTeX projects, I usually have one file main.tex and sub-directories including other tex files which are ultimately included in then main.tex. The way AUCTeX handles this is by setting TeX-master to point to main. Instead of setting this variable locally in each file, I used to have a &quot;.dir-locals&quot; file in each sub-directory to set TeX-master.
 Since dir-local variables are inherited, I wanted to make it so that I can set TeX-master in the root directory once for all files. For example, having the following structure:
  - main.tex - sub1.tex - .dir-locals.el - sub/ |-- subsub1.tex |-- subsub2.tex |-- subsub |-- subsubsub1.tex |-- subsubsub2.tex 
 and then have in .dir-locals.el 
 lisp ((latex-mode . ((TeX-master relpath &quot;main&quot;)))) 
 Then in both main.tex and sub1.tex, TeX-master would main but in subsub*.tex, TeX-master would be ../main, and subsubsub*.tex TeX-master would be ../../main and so on.
 Having an eval statement would not work since I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the path to the directory. The way I solved this is by advising hack-local-variables-filter to handle this particular value.
 What do you think of this solution? Comments on my lisp-fu are also welcome.
  (define-advice hack-local-variables-filter (:around (old-fn variables dir-name) replace-rel-path) (let ((new-variables (if dir-name (mapcar (lambda (x) (let ((val (cdr x))) (if (and (consp val) (eq (car val) &#x27;relpath)) (cons (car x) (file-relative-name (concat (file-name-as-directory dir-name) (cadr val)))) x))) variables) variables))) (funcall old-fn new-variables dir-name)))

                    <span>Hi,
 Total beginner here, I followed this tutorial to create a major mode for a scripting language that I need to use sometimes in my petroleum engineering work, its working great for me now, having different colors for different kinds of keywords makes editing and reading the file a lot easier, but when editing python scripts I have the ability to fold the classes or functions to easily navigate the code, and I have a list of all classes and functions using imenu-list, how can I add this feature to my custom made major mode? 
 Below is the code I assembled from the tutorial mentioned above:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun read-lines (filePath) &quot;Return a list of lines of a file at filePath.&quot; (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents filePath) (split-string (buffer-string) &quot;\n&quot; t)))

                    <span>When I use C-SPC or C-x b to switch to another buffer, my Dired buffer has an exclamation mark in front of it. Here&#x27;s an image of it.
 I&#x27;m not sure why it appears, but I assume it is to show it (or the buffer) is modified? I think it appeared after I marked a file for deletion in the Dired buffer with d and then deleted it with x.
 Sadly, I was not able to find anything while searching around. Google&#x27;s search operators absolutely hate trying to search for a !. Even when doing stuff like intext:(&quot;! Dired&quot;) or allintext:(&quot;! Dired&quot;), the AND operator didn&#x27;t help much either. Not even the  + operator worked, which is supposed to force an exact match. I also tried to search for more generalized strings, because that&#x27;s what the search engine is built more towards nowadays, but even with a verbose &#x27;exclamation mark&#x27; did not help me much.
 Thus, I gave up and came here. I am rather new to Emacs, so if it is something obvious, I have either missed it or just plain don&#x27;t know about it. All help is appreciated :)

Unfortunately my job does not allow me to help by reproducing bugs and this kind of stuff. Anyhow I am very glad to donate periodically. Where would you suggest me to donate in order to help? Directly Org? Or FSF? Both?

                    <span>Hi all, wanted to raise a discussion about a thought I had. 
 As a moderately experienced Emacs user (8 years), I&#x27;ve invested a LOT of time into learning and configuring Emacs (including email, RSS, browsing, calculator, etc). I can say that it does what I want and how I want it. I won&#x27;t go into the fact that it&#x27;s a never ending process because tastes and interests (+ jobs) change. 
 I would reckon that we all stick to Emacs, at least in some small part due to the sunk cost fallcy. Basically it means a price already paid in the past on our actions keep influencing our decisions in the future even though it shouldn&#x27;t. From the link: 
  
People demonstrate &quot;a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made.&quot;
  
The question of whether the time invested in Emacs is worth the productivity gained is discussed here all the time. My view is to justify it by a combination of the following: believing in FOSS, (related to that) text centricity, and it could be viewed as a mental hobby, a creative outlet. 
 However I might admit that I exhibit some sunk cost fallacy thinking. It becomes clear when I realize that I WON&#x27;T recommend Emacs to new users - unless they are going to invest large amounts of time learning it, like I did. 
 What are your thoughts on this? would you admit that there&#x27;s some irrational thinking in choosing Emacs over some other tools, e.g. the longer you use it the more you&#x27;re convinced it&#x27;s the best even though new tools are keep being developed.

                    <span>With Haskell being a compiled language, would it be possible to build a framework like WordPress with the ability of adding plugins, themes etc? The plugin system of WordPress is powered by PHP&#x27;s ability to load other PHP code at runtime as an interpreted language. The same thing goes with themes.
 Would it be possible to build a similar framework/system using Haskell?

                    <span>Good day
 I&#x27;m very new to Haskell and trying to write a simple game for practice. I&#x27;m trying to figure out an alternative approach with an element of the game, and I was looking for suggestions. Ideally, your suggestion should not be too advanced for a newbie and relatively easy to grok. :)
 The element of the game in question I am seeking help with is something I call Snapshot, which essentially just captures the number of every resource in the game at a certain point in time.
 Existing code:
 data Resource &#x3D; Wood | Wheat | Person | Stone | Gold | Weapons deriving (Show, Ord, Eq) data Snapshot &#x3D; Snapshot { resources :: [(Int, Resource)], buildings :: [(Int, Building)] } 
 As it is, each part of the program that creates or reads a Snapshot validates which resources are contained in the lis…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m using the external STG interpreter to observe the runtime behaviour of Haskell programs.
 Lately I&#x27;ve added an initial call-graph construction feature that I plan to refine further.
 https://twitter.com/csaba_hruska/status/1417486380536582151
 Is there anyone who has dynamic analysis related research ambitions and wants to study Haskell program runtime behaviour in detail?
 If so then it would be great to talk. 
 Cheers,
 Csaba

                    <span>Is there a place that has sample programs, hopefully easy or simple, to learn from? I feel like something like that would REALLY help me in my learning, If anything I could take the things that I don&#x27;t understand one at a time and work my way through the code. Thanks good people.

                    <span>I switched to DOOM from vanilla recently and found that the Agenda follow-mode didn&#x27;t work.
 I tried adding this line in the config file:
 (setq org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode t)
 I also tried M-x follow-mode in the Agenda buffer.
 But both didn&#x27;t work.
 How should I configure it?

 I am not a programmer and know nothing about lisp. I just copy those configurations here and there from the internet.

                    <span>I am a long-time coder learning scala. I am currently working through Programming Scala for Scala3.
 I don&#x27;t understand why pattern matching is a big deal. I get that it&#x27;s like a switch statement but more powerful because you can match types. 
 Where exactly is pattern matching applicable? What problems does it solve? Why is it such an integral part of the language? 
 Thanks for your help.

                    <span>dotty-cps-async 9.0 https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async is published on maven central (actually a few days ago, but during the week it was hard to manage time to write announce),
 What was changed since 1-st public release in the version, which is available for scala3 final:
 Main points behind bug fixing:
  
Implemented async variants for most high-order functions from scala standard library; Now, if you use await inside for loop or fold -- usually, it just works.
 The simplified setting of shifted version of high-order functions: now developer can declare one in place, instead of creating an extra typeclass.
 
Implemented custom call-chain builders: I.e., the following expression
  
 for( url  0) yield await(fetch(url))  will traverse through urls only once because we can merge filter and map in
 WithFilter call-chain builder.
  
Implemented support of automatic coloring:
  
I.e., we can write something like:
  async { val auth &#x3D; db.retrieveAuth(url) val data &#x3D; fetchData(auth,URL) if (isInteresting(data)) then db.increaseScoring(url) } 
 And the compiler will insert needed awaits automatically.
 This works not only for plain Futures but also for effect monads, such as cats-effects IO, Monix, and ZIO. (see article about this: https://github.com/rssh/notes/blob/master/2021_06_27_automatic-coloring-for-effects.md )
  
ScalaJS:
  
Implemented support for non-monadic objects in awaited statements (i.e., &#x60;js. Promise&#x60;) - now it is possible to use await(js.Promise) inside an async block.
 Implemented JSFuture, which looks like &#x27;promise&#x27; from the js side, but as typed monad on scala side.
 
  
Also, during the year passed from the 0.1 version, we tested it in few internal projects.

I have a lot of ebooks on my computer in .epub, .mobi, and .pdf formats. I read most of these on a kindle and I sync books to my kindle using calibre (https://calibre-ebook.com/). I highlight a lot of things and take a lot of notes while reading on the kindle.
Does anyone have a workflow for syncing highlights and notes taken on the kindle to markdown files?

                    <span>Sometimes I download Emacs on public computers, and I would rather not load certain parts of my config (such Newsticker feeds). How does one set up conditional loading (home vs public computers) and a fetch mechanism to retrieve the sensitive parts?

                    <span>Hello, I just migrated from org-roam v1 to v2 following the steps listed in https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/wiki/Hitchhiker&#x27;s-Rough-Guide-to-Org-roam-V2#migration-instructions . I always used deft (as suggested in the org-roam manual) to search the notes, but now deft summary looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/HGbCUSw which is not very useful: before, I could nicely read the title of the note in bold, now it&#x27;s all the same (:PROPERTIES:, :ID: etc..).
 I tried various combinations of deft-strip-title-regex and deft-strip-summary-regex trying to remove the unwanted parts, but without success.
 Anyone had the same problem and has a solution for this? Or maybe an alternative for full text searching and narrowing the notes like deft does?
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>This is a tip a lot of you are sure to know about, but it just made my day. pdf-tools has a dark mode called &quot;midnight mode&quot;.
 It can be activated with C-c C-r m – or M-x pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode if you can&#x27;t remember the keybinding.
 What&#x27;s more, there is even an associated variable, pdf-view-midnight-colors, which lets you set the foreground and background color of the render. In init.el I just put
 (setq pdf-view-midnight-colors &#x27;(&quot;#f8f8f2&quot; . &quot;#282a36&quot;)) 
 and now PDF looks at home with Dracula my theme of choice.
 Here&#x27;s what it looks like: https://i.imgur.com/Lqhxiim.png

                    <span>I&#x27;ve made my own Emacs theme where I only use the 16 standard and bright Terminal colors. I have my colors defined like this:
  (defvar theme-colors-alist &#x27;((&quot;black&quot; . &quot;black&quot;) (&quot;red&quot; . &quot;red&quot;) (&quot;green&quot; . &quot;green&quot;) (&quot;yellow&quot; . &quot;yellow&quot;) (&quot;blue&quot; . &quot;blue&quot;) (&quot;magenta&quot; . &quot;magenta&quot;) (&quot;cyan&quot; . &quot;cyan&quot;) (&quot;white&quot; . &quot;white&quot;) (&quot;brightblack&quot; . &quot;brightblack&quot;) (&quot;brightred&quot; . &quot;brightred&quot;) (&quot;brightgreen&quot; . &quot;brightgreen&quot;) (&quot;brightyellow&quot; . &quot;brightyellow&quot;) (&quot;brightblue&quot; . &quot;brightblue&quot;) (&quot;brightmagenta&quot; . &quot;brightmagenta&quot;) (&quot;brightcyan&quot; . &quot;brightcyan&quot;) (&quot;brightwhite&quot; . &quot;brightwhite&quot;) ) &quot;terminal colors.&quot;) 
 However, GUI emacs seems to only have the standard colors defined, not the bright colors. There is no &quot;brightred&quot;. I did some research and found out that the GUI gets its colors from rbg.txt which is an X11 specific file, and that it does not define those colors.
 So I&#x27;m wondering how I can handle this. Maybe there is a way to change the value of these mappings if emacs is running in GUI mode so I can map the bright colors to hex values or other colors?

 Hello Guys, I recently switched from ivy/counsel to vertigo/consult/embark but the issue I&#x27;m facing is that minibuffer completion. As you can see instead of completing the define-key, it says to click on the function. Can we customize this to complete functions/variables as we have in ivy

                    <span>Is there a way to show imenu contents in its own buffer? I would love to have a &quot;document map&quot; visible at all times.
 My current workaround is to use M-x occur and search for keywords such as &quot;class&quot; and &quot;function&quot;, but I can&#x27;t help wondering if there&#x27;s a better way.

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting to grips with the daunting but excellent bookmark+ extension. Tag based bookmark navigation lists are superb.
 The only issue I have is that I&#x27;m not seeing any backup bookmark files despite setting the recommended values from the docs at the link above.
 ​
 (use-package bookmark+ :demand :custom (bookmark-version-control t) (bookmark-save-flag 1) (delete-old-versions t) :after bookmark) 
 I do use no-littering that doesn&#x27;t appear to be hiding anything. ~/.emacs.d/var/bmkp/current-bookmark.el contains my bookmarks. Thats the only file there.
 ​
 So, the Q is : is auto backup working for you with bookmark+? Emacs 28.0.50.
 ​
 Or, have I missed something very obvious?

                    <span>I know there are a lot of solutions which can essentially create persistent (i.e. continues after Emacs close) workgroups, but they require a lot of manual tweaking.
 In particular, I feel like a solution to have persistent eyebrowse workgroups should be in place by now but, as far as I know, hasn&#x27;t. Does anyone have a solution of their own they are willing to share?

                    <span>I am working on emacs-27.2 of Windows 10 Build 19034.
 When Strike M-x shell, it invokes CMD, since foreach does not work
 C:\&gt;foreach foreach &#x27;foreach&#x27; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 
 You have to activate powershell by explicitly call PowerShell as:
 C:\&gt;powershell powershell Windows PowerShell Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Try the new cross-platform PowerShell https://aka.ms/pscore6 PS C:\&gt; foreach foreach 
 How could set PowerShell as the default shell?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get org capture to create a headline based on the name of the current project I&#x27;m working on. That way I can quickly capture a todo for that project, and then later on I can visit my projects.org file and each project will have it&#x27;s own heading, i.e.:
 * ~/path/to/project_1 ** Some todos * ~/path/to/project_2 ** Some todos 
 This is what I have:
 (defun my-org-capture () (interactive) (setq my-project-name (project-root (project-current))) (call-interactively #&#x27;org-capture)) (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;Project TODO&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/path/to/projects.org&quot; my-project-name) &quot;* TODO %? %^g\n%a&quot;) )) 
 I would expect this code to get the project root path, store it in my-project-name, and insert it as the headline in the capture template. Instead I get the error Wrong type argument: stringp, my-project-name.
 I&#x27;m aware I can manually do this by manually creating a headline for each project and refiling the captures correspondingly, but if possible I&#x27;d like to &quot;automate&quot; that away.

                    <span>OneLook is a thesaurus which uses the Datamuse API to search for synonyms for vague phrases (as opposed to words). 
 This has clearly helped me in times when I vaguely know what I&#x27;m trying to say but can&#x27;t quite put my finger on a word which approximates it. In these cases, PowerThesaurus is not useful.

                    <span>Hello everyone, Hope you all having a good time. 
 I have a simple function : 
 func :: IO String func &#x3D; let passed &#x3D; -- some func that return IO Bool in let result &#x3D; (\x -&gt; if x then &quot;passed&quot; else &quot;failed&quot;)  passed in result 
 &#x60; So, how can I bind the return value of func to some variable say, var :: IO String?
 Or this can&#x27;t be done or should not to be done? Writing var &#x3D; func won&#x27;t work. 
 I am a beginner in Haskell and FP overall so sorry if it sounds stupid. And another thing, why can&#x27;t I write something like &quot;let passed &#x3D; IO True&quot;? 
 A better qn would be how to put Bool inside IO context?

                    <span>Hello everyone :) In an attempt to level up my Haskell skills I&#x27;ve been trying to do Leetcode problems starting on the &#x27;easy&#x27; difficulty. This was the third problem I ran into and it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me how to solve it. What is the simplest way you can solve this problem in Haskell? I honestly found it a bit discouraging to have such difficulty with a problem that I could solve easily in other languages.
 Here&#x27;s the problem:
 Given a string s containing just the characters &#x27;(&#x27;, &#x27;)&#x27;, &#x27;{&#x27;, &#x27;}&#x27;, &#x27;[&#x27; and &#x27;]&#x27;, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. Example 1: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;()&quot; Output: true Example 2: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;()[]{}&quot; Output: true Example 3: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;(]&quot; Output: false Example 4: Input: s &#x3D; &quot;([)]&quot; Output: false

                    <span>There&#x27;s a fair bit of duplicated code between the two packages, and some mismatches. What are the historical/technical reasons TH doesn&#x27;t use more of the GHC api?

                    <span>I read several weeks ago that some bad politics happened on the freenode IRC #haskell channel. Is it still a good place to discuss Haskell? If not, is there a good alternative with decent network effects?

                    <span>I have (not too many) notes in the same directory of which I tag various headings (e.g. * Some Heading :person1:something-else:whatever). I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening, but when I search for a given tag using org-tags-view some tags don&#x27;t show up in the results. I know they&#x27;re there because a simple grep shows them.
 Am I missing something? Do I need to re-index my tags or something like that?

                    <span>I am extremely new to purescript and I am getting quite frustrated trying to find answers to simple questions online. I was hired to managed an existing codebase in purescript so I already have tons of existing code I need to work around. I have a newtype called ContentKey that derives from String. I then have a FFI returning a string. How if possible do I convert that string from a string to a ContentKey?
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>One thing I did miss from Java is the for(int i&#x3D;0; i (range), when used in simple &quot;for-comprehension&quot; with .foreach logic, gets treated with some macro magic :
 import scalqa.{*, given} val a &#x3D; new Array[Int](1000) for(i &gt; a.length) a(i) &#x3D; i 
 and gets compiled into direct JVM for-loop:
 int[] a &#x3D; (int[])(new int[1000]); int i &#x3D; 0; for(int e &#x3D; a.length; i  { for(i &quot;,()&#x3D;&gt; { for(i &gt; a.length ) a(i)&#x3D;i; a.length }), ) // Output Final Result.

Project B is an extension of project A, using project A and its dependency as a dependency. I am able to import project A as a dependency but not it&#x27;s dependencies. Any suggestions on how this could be achieved? Sorry I am still learning sbt.

                    <span>Hi folks, I am quite smitten with some of the features in auratikum.  Being able to search for and link notes to notes, or references to notes, or notes to references without having to &quot;manually&quot; link the items in markdown (for example).  Also it nicely takes care of the storage of notes and references in projects.   Any other similar self-hosted / open source software available?   And I forgot - mathjax (or similar) is essential.</span>

                    <span>I have the following in my init.el file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
 (setq-default tab-width 4)
 (setq indent-line-function &#x27;insert-tab)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 but now every time I press enter in any context as in just adding a new line out side of a regularly indented context it inserts a tab
 example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 int main () {
 } | &lt;-- say this is my cursor, if I press enter right here
 | &lt;-- my cursor ends up here
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Idk if it matters but I&#x27;m also using evil mode

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been have this issue ever since I switched to emacs28 with native comp. If I try to open a file directly in the terminal version of emacs (e.g. emacs -nw filename), emacs won&#x27;t open the file -- instead I get an error message saying: Symbol’s value as variable is void: \213, and a blank buffer.
 As far as I can tell, emacs works normally after that, and I can open the file with C-x C-f but it&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance. The --debug-init option gives no additional output. 
 This only happens with the -nw option. The gui works normally. 
 Anybody know what&#x27;s going on here?
 PS: I&#x27;m on MacOS and using the emacs-plus distribution from Homebrew.
 EDIT: After some investigation it turns out the following code inside my init.el file was the issue: 
 (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist) (setq file-name-handler-alist nil) (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist () (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist)) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook &#x27;startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist) 
 Anybody know why this would cause the error on emacs28?

                    <span>This is a question motivated by my desire to learn emacs and make a silly thing, not to build a super useful tool.
 I would like to create a minor mode so that when I&#x27;m editing text or org files, every instance of the word &quot;clock&quot; will be replaced by &quot;HH:MM&quot; which would represent the current time and would be updated every minute to stay accurate. 
 Is there a way to either have the buffer pull clock times every minute or for some sort of clock to push updates to a buffer every minute to trigger rerendering? 
 I&#x27;m not too sure on what to look for in the emacs docs to find what I need so any guidance would be much appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m moving my CV to org mode, exported to latex. I use org headlines as headings, and then plain lists and text for the body. I had previously kept the whole thing in latex, and have a format which I&#x27;m really happy with. I&#x27;m turning that into a custom class, which I will use in the export.
 Some of the headings have dates attached to them. The class file I&#x27;ve made redefines the the LaTeX section command to have two arguments: \\section{}{
}.
 The most obvious way I can see to store these associated dates in org mode is in a property, like :DATE: 2018. 
 Is there a way that I can inject these property&#x27;s values into the section strings in the export? The only similar functionality I have found so far is the strings in the third argument of org-latex-classes, but that only interpolates the heading title, and doesn&#x27;t provide any way of getting further information into the string.
 If this is just not possible at the moment, would anybody else be interested in it if I were to try to implement it?

                    <span>Hello r/emacs,
 I have a problem regarding EXWM. When I pop up an ansi-term buffer and run a command that updates the contents of it like htop, the caret starts jumping around and the focus of the frame moves along with it which is pretty annoying. Have you come across this issue? Could you share a workaround with me? Thanks in advance!

 In my new blog post I explain what Roam and Zettelkasten method is about and then how I use org-roam in practice with an example. Hope it can help some people on the edge to give it a try, after just one day I can say it is totally worth it!

                    <span>Recently I was switched on to fancy-dabbrev from the post: Package praise: Prodigy and fancy-dabbrev 
 Having completions preview in a way that can be quickly accepted without blocking input is great (as I&#x27;m now used to in fish).
 However fairly quickly I ran into some annoyances/functionality that wasn&#x27;t working as I needed.
 I&#x27;ve since submitted some PR&#x27;s which Joel Rosdahl has been kind enough to review &amp; apply.
  
Only complete when a preview is visible (fall-back to tab action) - so tab doesn&#x27;t complete when I don&#x27;t expect it to.
 Configurable tab action (command to fall back to when completion isn&#x27;t used).
 The message buffer is no longer flooded with noisy dabbrev progress reports.
 Fix for exiting fancy-dabbrev-mode leaving preview visible.
  
Highly recommend giving this package a look.
 My configuration:
 (use-package fancy-dabbrev :commands (fancy-dabbrev-mode) :config (setq fancy-dabbrev-preview-delay 0.1) (setq fancy-dabbrev-preview-context &#x27;before-non-word) (setq fancy-dabbrev-expansion-on-preview-only t) (setq fancy-dabbrev-indent-command &#x27;tab-to-tab-stop) (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;fancy-dabbrev-expand-or-indent)) 
 Since I find these kinds of packages a little intrusive (with pre/post commands that run on each key-stroke), I only enable this in evil-insert mode.
 ;; Only while in insert mode. (with-eval-after-load &#x27;evil (add-hook &#x27;evil-insert-state-entry-hook (lambda () (fancy-dabbrev-mode 1))) (add-hook &#x27;evil-insert-state-exit-hook (lambda () (fancy-dabbrev-mode 0))))

                    <span>I found a good, stack based setup to write Haskell applications and manage their dependencies. But I would like to use the language also for quick, exploratory work and small scripts. For that it seems to be unnecessary complicated to create a .cabal and a stack.yaml file. Instead I would like to maintain a global set of packages that are just available when I open ghci in my terminal.
 Both cabal and stack seem to be able to install Haskell packages globally. I&#x27;m a bit lost, though, which setup is more convenient and where the pitfalls are. I was hoping some more experienced Linux users could share their experiences (I&#x27;m on Manjaro and Ubuntu).

There seem to be many sundry things on Hackage, Wiki, etc. for math, but scant documentation -- unless you want to read skeleton-ish data type source and puzzle out what&#x27;s going on, what might be going on once fleshed out.
 Just this beginner&#x27;s delvings indicate to me that Haskell would make as good a CAS as any other language. Not that I&#x27;m qualified to make a final decision. While doing math with other leading languages has many thick textbooks, I only know of 2-1/2 books (one is SML-based), all dealing (quite well) with discrete math. Am I missing something? Did I arrive at the conversation late? Why doesn&#x27;t Haskell have a nice, big chunk of CAS and numerical analysis?

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 How do you handle the problem of synchronization between your org agenda and other calendar services (e.g through your mobile ) ?
 Another related question, how did you import Google Calendar schedule into an org file?

                    <span>I haven&#x27;t really been able to find anything that works regarding this.
 Say I have two files, file1.org and file2.org. In file1.org I have the src that is going to tangle to result1.el, in file2.org there is something specific that is useful in that file but also in file1.org.
 It&#x27;d be nice to be able to include it in a similar fashion of how you can do it with noweb yes in the same file, rather than having to duplicate the code.
 Hopefully my explanation is good enough, but if not, please give me a heads up and I&#x27;ll try to explain better!

                    <span>Hi all,
 ​
 I use a capture template to add TODOs to entries under a date tree, to help me keep track of them. However, I don&#x27;t need the date tree to add the /day/ that the TODO was added, I just need the year and the month - is there a way to limit the date tree to just years and months? Thanks in advance!

                    <span>So. I can&#x27;t say compile-time reflection and code generation is bad. But. When porting existing code to Scala3, I found out compile-time reflection has some issues hampering my productivity.
 - Compile-time reflection API is much more complex than runtime reflection API
 - new reflection API is badly documented and behaves weirdly in corner cases
 - Compile-time reflection is impossible to debug, logging is all you have.
 - Compile-time reflection is pain to test, incremental compilation does not track macros so I have to rebuild every time.
 Summarizing, runtime reflection is huge boost in productivity for complex cases. Writing some tests is much easier (faster, simpler code, less maintenance) than getting compile-time reflection to work.
 Soooo.... Any signs?

                    <span>In Property Based Testing (PBT) the programmer specifies desirable properties or invariants for the code under test, and uses a test framework to generate random inputs to find counter-examples.
For example, “a reversed list has the same size as the original list” which can be written as:
fun l -&gt; List.length (List.reverse l) &#x3D; List.length l

Imagine this test fails for the list [42; 9079086709; -148; 9; -9876543210].
Does this counter-example fail the test because there are 5 elements? Or because there are negative numbers? Or maybe due to the big numbers?
Many reasons are possible.
To help narrow down the cause of test failures, most PBT libraries provide a feature called shrinking.
The idea is that once a test fails for a given input, the test engine will try less complex inputs, to fin…</span>

Jared Gorski wrote a response to my article “Backlinks are bad links”. Since it’s a short and concise response, a re-response is warranted. He summarised my point fairly and sufficiently, so I don’t need to repeat myself here. If you are not familiar, please read the article linked above. I’ll reply to Jared’s post point by point.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for a while now and am really enjoying it. However, I&#x27;m running into an issue with calctex. If I open up calctex via M-x calc, then inputting anything freezes emacs. However, if I run the embedded-calc, then it works perfectly fine. 
 I&#x27;m using emacs-mac on an m1 MacBook, but the same issue occurs with emacs-28. I&#x27;m using BasicTex installed via home-brew as my tex distribution, and all required packages are installed via tlmgr. 
 Note that I&#x27;ve already put tecosaur&#x27;s fix for dvichop in my config: https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#calc-calctex 
 Is there anything else I&#x27;m missing?

                    <span>The trick of switching CAPS to CONTROL is classic, and highly recommended for emacs. But, on a full size keyboard, this leaves the right pinky stretching down to the far corner still. Now, the symmetrical fix would be the ENTER key, but remapping that seems problematic. What are some recommendations for getting the right hand to experience some of the same savings that the left hand does with the CTRL rebinding?

                    <span>I have tried this
 (defun org-xob--save-object (file data) &quot;save emacs object. &quot; (with-temp-file file (prin1 (symbol-value data) (current-buffer)))) 
 But it frequently fails. My current project (simple, quick sets) needs 100% reliability, there will be no other source to rebuild from. I am open to another data structure if necessary.
 Research:
  
In this thread, Felip Lema mentions that he has successfully used &#x60;persist-defvar&#x60; . (noted: skeeto explanation)
 nothing conclusive in &#x60;emacs-devel&#x60;

                    <span>I am impressed with the new functionality of Org-Roam. I also see that there is a bit of a learning curve when changing from Org-Roam v 1 to Org-Roam v 2. Of course, there is the excellent documentation, but this is a little bit overwhelming to me. Are there some sources with easy tutorials or introductions of Org-Roam Version 2?

                    <span>Recently I have built my emacs from source with xwidget support.I figured out how to call function in javascript from emacs-lisp.You can do this with xwidget-webkit-execute-script function like this:
  (xwidget-webkit-execute-script (with-current-buffer &quot;*xwidget webkit: *&quot; (xwidget-at 1)) &quot;myFunction()&quot; ;; name of my javascript function ;; additional callback here if I want to get the return value or do something else ) 
 How can I do it the other way around? I mean, trigger some emacs-lisp function after e.g.: button click in my javascript widget?

 ((nil . ((projectile-project-compilation-dir . &quot;misc&quot;))))
 But the value is still nil:
 projectile-project-compilation-dir is a variable defined in projectile.el Value nil 
 I can confirm &#x60;dir-local-variables-alist&#x60; is properly set:

                    <span>I have some websites that are served from user directories, so a domain like www.domain.com will have the root in the server configuration as:
 /home/joebloggs/websites/www.domain.com/www/html.
 The idea is to create a table of the kind
 | user | website | |-----------+---------------------| | joebloggs | www.domain.com | | janesmith | www.fancydomain.net | 
 etc.
 If I replicate the root directory in two columns then in one of them the search and replace should delete the /home/ and /websites/www.domain.com/www/html in ther user column and in the website column the search and replace would delete /home/joebloggs/websites/ and /www/html.
 I&#x27;m sure there are fancier methods but I would prefer it to be a sequence of regular search and replace using the vi syntax, ie :s/xxx/yyy/g in the minibuffer but use regexes to match the relevant parts.

                    <span>Hi there,
 I want to use a proprietary C++ library from Haskell using FFI under Linux (in case it matters, I’m running GHC 8.0.2 on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS). 
 Taking inspiration in the “sin” example in chapter 17 of the Real World Haskell, I started with use a &quot;C-only&quot; small example with 3 small files (&quot;.c&quot;, &quot;.h&quot; and &quot;.hs&quot;), and that worked fine.
 File “code2.h” looks like so:
 double plus_one(double x); 
 File “code2.c” looks like so:
 #include &quot;code2.h&quot; double plus_one(double x) { return x + 1.0; } 
 File “ffi2.hs” looks like so:
 {-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-} import Foreign import Foreign.C.Types foreign import ccall &quot;code2.h plus_one&quot; c_plus_one :: CDouble -&gt; CDouble ffi_plus_one :: Double -&gt; Double ffi_plus_one x &#x3D; realToFrac (c_plus_one (realToFrac x)) main &#x3D; mapM_ (print . f…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using LogicT lately and discovered that msplit causes some pretty bad slow downs. Edward Kmett pointed out to me that the Reflection without Remorse paper covers this in depth as well as provides a solution. In the paper, sequences, such as sequences of binds are reified into type aligned sequences. This makes it cheap to inspect them without reassociating the binds. Thus getting rid of the quadratic slowdown incurred by inspecting the sequence. There is a downside in that the constant factors are worse.
 I looked around a bit on hackage to see if anyone had packaged up the LogicT version from the paper. I found one package based on the paper that applied the techniques to the free monad. Also, one of the paper authors uploaded two packages related to the paper for working with t…</span>

                    <span>Hey all, I want to have a todo block in org-agenda with the most immediate deadline items first, followed by items without deadlines, like
 proj1: TODO 2021-08-18 foo proj2: TODO 2021-08-19 bar proj3: TODO foobar proj4: TODO baz 
 However, setting (org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(deadline-up)) puts items without deadlines first, like:
 proj3: TODO foobar proj4: TODO baz proj1: TODO 2021-08-18 foo proj2: TODO 2021-08-19 bar 
 And of course, setting &#x27;deadline-down puts later deadlines first, then closer deadlines, then items without deadlines, which isn&#x27;t what I want either.
 How would I go about ordering a todo block in the desired order of closer deadlines-&gt;further deadline-&gt;entries without deadlines. It seems like org should have a built in way to do it, but will I have to write something custom to get it working as expected?

                    <span>While messing around with a mundane Bash utility, I had a realization - the way I write Bash is primitive beyond Python&#x27;s level of interactivity - where I can hit C-c C-c to reload the buffer&#x27;s definitions in the prompt and otherwise execute newly-defined code piecemeal - let alone Lisp(s).
 This wasn&#x27;t noteworthy earlier because &quot;shell isn&#x27;t a serious language&quot; and nothing I write is more than ~100 lines I think, yet I, in sum, probably have written more of it than anything. (because the terminal is the terminal and it gets things done, day after day) Easing the transition from (increasingly lengthy and arcane) a la carte invocations to standalone scripts would be among the more productive uses of time for extending Emacs.
 I use vterm as my primary terminal, and generally re-execute the whole script as a unit, as if it were in a edit-compile-debug cycle. How can I make the setup more SLIME-like?

                    <span>I&#x27;m struggling to use emacs for React development, and I just can&#x27;t get Graphql syntax highlighting and indentation to work in web-mode.
 I know there&#x27;s graphql-mode, but it&#x27;s a major mode and it replaces the web-mode. So if I activate it, graphql highlighting works, but jsx and the rest stop working.
 Can someone please help me to figure out how to make both jsx and graphql syntax/indentation work in emacs? Maybe share your config?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve googled and have not found any package that does this, but I figured I&#x27;d ask here as well in case I&#x27;ve missed something. Is it possible to convert org-mode files to R markdown -- I&#x27;m interested specifically in using R&#x27;s bookdown feature. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no org-mode equivalent to bookdown, so I&#x27;ve decided to just convert all my org-mode files to Rmd and use their tools (I know you can probably achieve something similar with the org-html exporter, but not without a lot of work). 
 Has anybody been able to do this?

                    <span>I have written another emacs package during a rainy sunday afternoon. dired-gitignore.el is a minor mode for dired to hide and show items in your dired buffer, that are ignored by git due to an entry in .gitignore
 As of now the easiest way of installing it is to use straight.el as described in the README of the repo.
 After some testing period I will submit it also to MELPA.
 Have fun, feedback welcome.

                    <span>Hello fellow &#x27;macers,
 after having tested both MPDel and EMMS, I came to like the first more. One thing bumps me out, though. It has some very long key prefix (C-x Z), and I cannot change it.
 Whenever I try to set it - either in use-package, or outside of use-package, using (setq mpdel-prefix-key (kbd &quot;s-m&quot;)) - it comes up with an error saying: package.el mpdel failed to define keymap mpdel-prefix-key. And this is strange because in the beginning of mpdel.el (using M-. on the mpdel package), one of the first things defined is (defcustom mpdel-prefix-key ...).
 Is anyone else here using mpdel and has encountered similar issues? 
 Otherwise, any tips/suggestions welcome.
 Thanks a bunch, have a good day!

 In the post below I show how one can select hyperlinks with moldable-emacs when they are hard to grab from your browser:

                    <span>Is it possible to customize Emacs to open files/windows/tabs from the previous session before it was killed? Since most of the time, I am working on one project at a time, I find it helpful if my windows opened up when I started Emacs. IIRC, other editors/IDEs do this by default. My Google-fu doesn&#x27;t lead to any helpful results. Any help will be appreciated. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>The set of functions that comes with Emacs sucks. Variable / function names don&#x27;t start with the thing it operates on (mark-, buffer- etc..) and functions are named haphazardly, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to discover functions while programming without having to refer to the guide (which also sucks)....
 So I&#x27;d like to ask if there were any efforts to wrap the standard library and provide a sensible api ?

                    <span>One thing that&#x27;s kept Emacs in Evil Mode, and Vim before it, from being a fully functioning text editor for me was that I couldn&#x27;t use it extensively for Korean writing projects due to the need to shift manually to Korean input when entering insert mode.
 (Yes I did the tutorial and gave the default Emacs keybinds a try for a while. I&#x27;m glad I know them but they weren&#x27;t for me.)
 Recently I redefined the evil-insert function to add toggle-korean-input-method to the end, and this achieved what should be the default behavior for Vim/Evil Mode imo, switching the language input method to what it was before leaving input mode last time.
 I won&#x27;t reproduce the whole redefined function since all I did was repeat the whole function in my init.el while adding one line after (evil-insert-state 1), like this:
 (evil-insert-state 1) (toggle-korean-input-method) )) 
 The obvious solution might have been to advise the function, which was the first thing I tried but it resulted in breaking the evil-insert function. Here&#x27;s the advice I tried:
 (advice-add &#x27;evil-insert :after #&#x27;toggle-korean-input-method) 
 Maybe I did it wrong but it made Evil Mode unusable, and the Emacs manual says advising a function called by other functions is is bad practice so I went with redefinition, clunky though it is.
 Frankly I don&#x27;t entirely understand why this works the way it does, but it&#x27;s made me very happy and maybe it&#x27;ll be helpful to others :)

                    <span>How do I remap my modifier keys so that right shift is super, right control is meta, right alt is hyper, and left alt is alt?
 I&#x27;m using Windows and GNU Emacs.
 EDIT: Got something working. It&#x27;s hacky af, but it&#x27;s something. In my .emacs file:
 (setq w32-pass-apps-to-system nil) (setq w32-apps-modifier &#x27;super) (setq w32-scroll-lock-modifier &#x27;alt) (setq w32-pass-rwindow-to-system nil) (setq w32-rwindow-modifier &#x27;hyper) (w32-register-hot-key [H-]) 
 And in AutoHotKey (AHK):
 ScrollLock:: While GetKeyState(&quot;ScrollLock&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) { SetScrollLockState, On } SetScrollLockState, Off Return PrintScreen:: While GetKeyState(&quot;PrintScreen&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) { SetScrollLockState, On } SetScrollLockState, Off Return RShift:: if WinActive(&quot;emacs@DESKTOP-FOO&quot;) { Send, {AppsKey down} } else { Send, {RShift down} Return } Return RShift up:: if WinActive(&quot;emacs@DESKTOP-FOO&quot;) { Send, {AppsKey up} } else { Send, {RShift up} Return } Return 
 I tried to remap Right Win to Right Control, but Emacs can&#x27;t intercept it. It can intercept the real key, but not the artificial one. That means I have to use my pinkies, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world because my pinkies only have to move up one row to hit the two Right Wins. 
 I think that&#x27;s good for now; after all, I can chain them.

                    <span>hi r/emacs I have been an emacs user since 2008. Still have not put in the time to master lisp or configuring emacs. I have a copy-paste config that has landed me in some weird mix.
 My current config shared here. adds 8 spaces in python mode mysteriously and i have tried everything to solve it with no luck. I could use some help.
 Also if some one wants to make some extra $ or BTC i would be happy to pay to have my config set up right. 
 Here is what i would like from my emacs set up:
 - Python development
 - Rust development
 - React development
 - I would like to have autocomplete
 - linters - eslint and I am open to what i use for python amd rust
 - Auto complete - preferably company mode
 - Git integration.

 What should I do to solve this problem?

Been looking at haskell.org but if you have a recommendation and want to save me hours of trying to find and familiarize myself with something that isn&#x27;t quite what I need, well, I would appreciate it very much.

 I am _not_ looking for a library that matches Regular Expressions on a given string. I need to use the parsed Haskell data type for something else which I will be doing inside Haskell itself.

                    <span>The statement is as follows: Implement an executable program that produces statistics about a file provided as input. The statistics produced must be the number of lines and words present in the file.
 I managed to write the code, but I didn&#x27;t understand how to run the executable with a text file as an argument.
 ​
  The files at the end of the three red arrows correspond respectively to the executable created with \&quot;stack build\&quot;, the file where I wrote the code and the test text file. 
 I tried &quot;stack exec exercicio-exe&quot; but obviously the text file reference is missing.

Sometimes it corrects itself and the normal color pallet appears and other times I have to close the buffer and reopen the file to get it to render correctly.

 For system information, I&#x27;m using Doom on Emacs 27.2.

                    <span>Im making a custom agenda page, and I want to have a sorted index of certain tags for one block. What I&#x27;ve wrote is working fine, but I want to specify a directory for the block itself. Heres what I have right now:
  (org-ql-block &#x27;(and (tags)(not(todo))) ((org-ql-block-header &quot;Tag Index&quot;) ;;defines super agenda groups for this block (org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;( (:name &quot;Moving&quot; :tag (&quot;MOVING&quot; &quot;COLLEGE&quot;)) (:name &quot;Health&quot; :tag (&quot;DIET&quot; &quot;MEDICAL&quot; &quot;MENTAL&quot;)) (:name &quot;Noted&quot; :tag (&quot;IDEA&quot; &quot;MEMO&quot; &quot;DREAM&quot;)) (:discard (:anything t)) )) ) 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi folks 
 I am proud to release a project, which took me a decade to develop (though first 5 years I worked in Java). There are many new ideas and Scala3 became the ingenious technology to make them happen.
 Scalqa stands for &#x27;Scala Quick API&#x27;. It is built around fast proprietary collections, which support unboxed processing of primitive types.
 It also provides a standardized way to define opaque data based on Java primitives. Data elements naturally inherit built-in specialized collections.
 A simple J.Benchmark test
 import scalqa.{*, given} val array: Array[Int] &#x3D; (1 to 1000).toArray J.Benchmark( (&quot;Array&quot;, () &#x3D;&gt; array .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0).sum), (&quot;Iterator&quot;, () &#x3D;&gt; array.iterator.map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0).sum), (&quot;Scalqa Stream&quot;, () &#x3D;&gt; array.~ .map(_.toLong).filter(_ % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0).sum), ) 
 yields output
 Final Result. Total length is about 12 secs --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- Num Name Ops/Sec % Memory % Avg Value --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 1 Array 29.8k 30 97.6kB 100 250500.0 2 Iterator 27.3k 28 45.9kB 47 250500.0 3 Scalqa Stream 97.4k 100 517B 0 250500.0 --- ------------- ------- --- ------ --- --------- 
 Memory consumption clearly indicates unboxed processing.
 The value proposition is: Scalqa is much simpler and faster than general language API. Also, one can immediately be efficient with opaque types, which otherwise would take long time to get right.
 The project feature set is complete, but any good ideas (based on feedback) will still be taken in before version 1.0 in late Fall.
 Any discussion will be appreciated, for larger questions please use the new GitHub discussions feature.
 PS. The documentation is still &quot;work in progress&quot;, sorry for any inconsistencies you might come across.

                    <span>Hello guys, a emacs and doom-emacs newbie here. I recently installed emacs and doom-emacs and I wanted to make doom-emacs ready for python development just like pycharm or vscode with autocompletions and code navigations atleast. So, I followed this link from the official documentation and installed mspyls as the language server for emacs. It did work and it does give me autocompletion for the inbuilt modules but for third party libraries like pandas and numpy it gives me a :
 unable to import pandas/numpy [import-error] 
 I&#x27;ve install pyenv in emacs for pyenv-mode as well as installed pyenv in my machine. I&#x27;ve activated the environment through emacs and emacs shows the name of the environment as well as the version of python in the bottom right corner. I&#x27;ve also installed pandas and numpy in that environment but emacs is not able to recognize the packages.
 Screenshot of emacs with pyenv:
 ​

 Also, I&#x27;ve tried some other links like this where packages like pyvenv is suggested. Although I&#x27;ve managed to install pyvenv and also create/activate the virtual environment from it and also install pandas and numpy in the virtual environment, emacs is not able to import third party packages.
 Screenshot of emacs with pyvenv:

 Any help would be appreciated to resolve this error.

                    <span>Is there inbuilt functionality or package that requests root permissions when editing files that are required to be edited as root or with a program like sudo?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve discovered that Emacs and/or Org-Mode is a &quot;rabbit hole&quot; (there&#x27;s an actual post about this in this group). 
 ​
  : I&#x27;m not an expert at either Emacs or Org-mode. 
 But Org-mode and Emacs are both very large systems, and sometimes I feel like they really are so large, and so complex - that there is a trap, of tinkering with E/O and never getting anything done (of value-add). 
 However - playing devil&#x27;s advocate - building / configuring org-mode / emacs is alot like building your own light saber / becoming a jedi: incredibly powerful tools / processes, but in the wrong hands, they are worthless, or dangerous. Only when used correctly can they help you actually get real work done. 
 It hasn&#x27;t taken me long to figure out that the only real way to &quot;master&quot; (use competently) org-mode/emacs is to just dive in, figure out what YOU want out of your management system, and go for it. 
 if you find your self at a dead end, it&#x27;s probably not a limitation of the system, but a limitation on your specificity of your goal / problem. 
 However complex, labyrinth-ian both systems get, they will never be outpaced by other &quot;note taking &quot; apps . 
 Why? 
 ​
 because org-mode and emacs are both more about the processing of text than simply note-taking. 
 ​
 I really think that the future of org-mode however, is to move away from some of the architectural constraints of emacs.

                    <span>Consider this newtype:
 newtype Stacked f a &#x3D; Stacked { unStacked :: forall r. f r -&gt; f (a, r) } deriving Functor 
 With this you can define an Applicative instance for any Functor:
 instance Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Applicative (Stacked f) where pure x &#x3D; Stacked (fmap (x,)) Stacked p  Stacked q &#x3D; Stacked (fmap (\(f, (x, y)) -&gt; (f x, y)) . p . q) 
 Here the tuples that are returned form a sort of stack which can be pushed to as in the pure function and popped as in the definition of .
 I found this pattern in the future parsers described in Section 4.6 of &quot;Combinator parsing: a short tutorial&quot;. Their Pf st a is coercible to Stacked (ReaderT st Steps) a.
 Does this newtype already exist in some library?
 This also reminds me a bit of monoidal functors. Is there some connection to category theory here?

                    <span>Hi, I am new to scala and I have been trying to understand case classes and I came across this
 case class Block(b1: Pos, b2: Pos):
 // Additional Methods
 case class Pos(row: Int, col: Int):
 // Additional Methods 
 val b &#x3D; Block(Pos(0, 0), Pos(0,1))
 val c &#x3D; Pos(0,0)
 b &#x3D;&#x3D; c // Returns False 
 My question is how are b and c being compared, if they are different case classes ? Does scala assume they are of the same type ?

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m new to emacs and I just installed ivy, counsel, swiper, flycheck, paredit and the base company packages. I think all that is left is an auto-completion package (if there are other stuff I might need but don&#x27;t know, please say so).
 In my search for auto-completion packages, I came across rtags, irony, ycmd and cquery, I&#x27;ve seen comments about rtags and irony not being good for large projects (although rtags can handle larger projects than irony). I&#x27;ve also heard that rtags wouldn&#x27;t work if there are many errors and that there were some problems when the irony server was up for long. I visited ycmd&#x27;s repo, and it seems to now be unmaintained: abingham/emacs-ycmd: Emacs client for ycmd, the code completion system. (github.com) 
 Many people said that they were interested in cquery, but most of what I found was from a few years back, so I just wanted to ask how far have these packages come? can I use a combination of them at once? are there stuff that one is better at than the rest at?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;m very interested in using emacs to write college papers, since I do all of my note taking and organizing on there as well. However, the formatting requirements have left me stuck writing papers in LibreOffice. The research I&#x27;ve done is mostly geared towards people writing technical papers, not general English/non-technical papers. Does anyone on here use emacs to write papers? Are there any special tools or features you use that make it easier?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m doing some programming exercises from a site called exercism, because even simple programming problems can be fun and give you an opportunity to learn things. One of the exercises is about detecting anagrams in a list.
 There are lots of ways to do it, but decided to try something that was less about manually iterating through the characters in a word myself and more about using built-in functionality.
 (defun anagrams-for (word anagram-list) (cl-loop for drow in anagram-list with tmp-drow &#x3D; drow unless (equal (downcase word) (downcase drow)) do (setq tmp-drow drow) unless (cl-mismatch (cl-sort word &#x27;&lt; :key &#x27;downcase) (cl-sort drow &#x27;&lt; :key &#x27;downcase)) collect tmp-drow)) 
 First, that with tmp-drow &#x3D; drow absolutely does not work as I expect. The cl-loop is supposed to set variables in a let* manner, but when that with is called, drow is still unset. That&#x27;s why I do the setq later.
 Second, cl-sort is destructive, so I thought I&#x27;d be able to copy the value into tmp-drow and avoid the rearranging of pointers that it performs. However, that&#x27;s not the case. Is there a way to explicitly make a copy of the data, not just what&#x27;s being pointed to?

I tried using Corfu, everything works fine as expected but whenever I try to use corfu in c-mode buffers while using Elgot as LSP client and ccls as server, it doesn&#x27;t show me any completions whereas Corfu works for me in Zig, Rust, Python and JavaScript modes. Can anyone help me?
 I also tried vertico, but it doesn&#x27;t show completions for everything like if I press :e in normal state while using Evil mode, it doesn&#x27;t show me completions. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, can you guys help me out!

                    <span>So i don&#x27;t like vim &quot;hjkl&quot; model, and installed doom emacs to try out some alternatives. I really like default binds shown in tutorial like C-v / M-v / C-f / C-b / C-n / C-p / C-u etc.
 I was really disillusioned when i discovered that tutorial does not apply (evil). Tried to disable evil manually but now space doesn&#x27;t do anything. 
 I always first learn the tool, then customize/ tinker with, so i would really appreciate any advice on &#x27;out-of-the box variation&quot; like doom that is not evil.

                    <span>I have used lsp mode with web mode along with some other minor modes for web app developments. But the performance was too bad for me, of course i don&#x27;t have a state of art computer (pretty old one actually), but thats really no excuse for pure performance, by poor performance i meant ram usage, speed, processor usage etc. For example when working on a react project in typescript (tsx created by CRA), the ram usage increased up to several gb and eventually or immediate there were input lags and really slow and sluggish performance. meanwhile i found vscode very performant on same machine on same project. lsp isn&#x27;t slow for any other mode, i use it frequently for go, python, c/c++, they work smoothly. Then i tried out tide in web mode, and boy it was a good change. tide works out of the box, very well, fast enough and it didn&#x27;t eat up so much ram either. i am not very familiar to elisp tracebacks, so just moved on to tide, instead of going deeper. i feel somewhat guilty for that, but i just don&#x27;t know where to start or where to look at, cause lsp-mode code is huge and i don&#x27;t know where to begin.
 Anyway, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you find any solution? I looked into the git issues but not much luck. I am liking tide very much, great project.
 If you are wondering about my emacs configs here they are.

                    <span>Hi. Please help me implement alternating background color under each section in emacs outline minor mode. Org mode has this feature where each section (the region between headings) have a different background color to help you see the different regions of text better. Magit also has this feature. Please advise. Thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs and org-mode at work for note taking and task management. Until now I&#x27;ve used my own laptop for this and it&#x27;s been working very well. I&#x27;m also looking to integrate org-roam in my workflow as soon as v2 is stable.
 We&#x27;ve only recently been handed work laptops, so currently I&#x27;m travelling with both laptops, which is not really convenient. As the work laptop (Windows 10) is heavily secured (no admin access, no installs of apps in user context either, lots of security-related logging and alerts, ssh client disabled), I guess that the only way to use emacs on this thing is over https (which is monitored as well, mind you). I do have experience with self-hosting some stuff on my own domain, so I&#x27;m looking for a web application I can self-host which allows me to use emacs over a web browser.
 There are many pieces of information about this, such as
  
shell apps: gotty, web-console, gateone, shellinabox, butterfly, webssh: most seem no longer maintained and there&#x27;s no clear indication regarding conflicts with key mappings between the browser/app and emacs ;
 more specific emacs/orgmode apps: cloudmacs, organice, orgmodweb, filestash, org-web: they are more limited by nature, but I might use them if they have support for custom agenda views which I use heavily ;
 the use of chrome web app mode or spacemacs to resolve the keymapping problem.
  
So, before going through each and every combination, or having to torture my muscle memory, does anybody have a thorough (and positive) experience of using emacs, or at least org-mode, in a browser on a daily basis ?

                    <span>Did someone manage to setup eglot correctly with straight.el? I would like to give it a try (lsp-mode is somewhat too bloated for my taste), but it looks as if there is some friction between those packages. For example both of those issues are still present although are marked as closed.

                    <span>I use spacemacs with a ton of packages and memory-report says this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Estimated Emacs Memory Usage
 65.8 MiB Overall Object Memory Usage 26.8 MiB Reserved (But Unused) Object Memory 12.1 MiB Memory Used By Global Variables 6.7 MiB Memory Used By Symbol Plists 1.3 MiB Total Buffer Memory Usage 0.0 KiB Total Image Cache Size
 Object Storage
 25.7 MiB Vectors 18.2 MiB Strings 17.9 MiB Conses 3.0 MiB Symbols 1.1 MiB Intervals 22.3 KiB Buffer-Objects 6.3 KiB Floats &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 A quick glance tells me that&#x27;s &lt;200MiB which sounds about right.
 However, top reports Emacs as using ~583MiB in total and this climbs to gigabytes over the course of a few days. Emacs never uses this memory more than once because it&#x27;s almost always swapped out.
 I have disabled GC because it makes Emacs a stuttery mess but I set up a trigger set up to GC whenever Emacs loses focus (which is often) and doing a manual GC doesn&#x27;t change anything about Emacs&#x27; RAM usage.
 This is happening on both Linux and OSX with 27.2 and 28.5.
 Does your Emacs ever give memory back to the OS?
 How big is the delta between the tallied-up memory-report and real-world usage? (as reported by top in its USED metric (RSS + SWAP).

                    <span>Hello there,
 In the past couple of years that I&#x27;ve been using emacs, I&#x27;ve never had a reason to give org-mode a try, but now I do. I Installed linux and wordpress on a raspberry-pi-4(which I&#x27;m going to use as a local web server to host the blog), and was able to get wordpress up and running nicely with some themes and plugins.
 When searching: does emacs work with wordpress, I saw this org2blog emacs package: https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog .
 Anyways, my goal is to use this local pi linux web server to host a simple wordpress blogging website. At 1st I just want to have a single web page, where I post a professional photo of myself with a hyperlink to my github projects. Eventually, I would like to do full blown blog posts with all kinds of stuff, like for example, if I&#x27;m applying for a particular freelance project, lets say python web scraping, I would want to create a simple python web-scraping application, push the completed project to github, then write a blog post, where I show step by step with coding blocks, how I developed and built the application from scratch. That way I can demonstrate to the client that I have the necessary skills required to complete that particular freelance gig.
 If there&#x27;s any extra wordpress themes/plugins that you&#x27;d recommend for this use-case, then let me know.
 Also, I&#x27;m new to wordpress, so I&#x27;m not sure how remote wordpress development works, I would like to develop the blog using emacs on my laptop, test it to make sure that it works correctly and does not crash wordpress, then push the changes remotely to wordpress on the pi linux web server.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>Hey all, this is my first serious attempt at making something in Haskell and I&#x27;d really appreciate any feedback you might have, be it whether something is not idiomatic Haskell or if there&#x27;s a simpler/better way to accomplish something. https://github.com/osoleve/Name-QuickSearch
 The purpose of the tool is to allow for fast matching of names (or other short natural language strings) against another set of names using fuzzy similarity metrics, letting you get, say, the highest scoring name out of a set of hundreds of thousands using Jaro-Winkler in under a second. Most of the speed is achieved using a token-matching heuristic, where the similarity scores are only computed between pairs of names sharing an entire token, with token inventories being precomputed and stored in a hashmap.
 It works pretty much exactly as I want so far, but as a Haskell beginner I&#x27;m sure there are improvements that can be made, and I figured this would be a good place to ask.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>When defining a custom record type to match some table, I sometimes want to use record field types other than the default ones assumed by opaleye.
 E.g. for a (Field SqlNumeric), I don&#x27;t want to use a Scientific in the Haskell record type when the scale of the postgresql NUMERIC field is 0; it makes more sense to use Integer instead of Scientific. Similarly, if a column is of a domain that constrains the value to be non-negative, it may make more sense to use an unsigned type such as Word64 instead of Int64.
 Consider the following code:  data Rec&#x27; a b &#x3D; Rec { a :: a, b :: b } type Rec1 &#x3D; Rec&#x27; Scientific Scientific type Rec2 &#x3D; Rec&#x27; Integer Integer type RecField &#x3D; Rec&#x27; (Field SqlNumeric) (Field SqlNumeric) $(makeAdaptorAndInstance &quot;pRec&quot; &#x27;&#x27;Rec&#x27;) recTable :: Table RecField RecField recTable &#x3D; table &quot;rec&quot; (pRec Rec { a &#x3D; tableField &quot;a&quot;, b &#x3D; tableField &quot;b&quot; }) 
 If I try to use selectTable recTable and runSelect to read a [Rec1] it&#x27;s fine, but if I try to read a [Rec2], I get a compilation error (No instance for (Opaleye.Internal.RunQuery.DefaultFromField SqlNumeric Integer). How can I simply map the table to a record type that uses Integer instead of Scientific without adding much boilerplate? I only need to read the tables, not write to them.

                    <span>I recently listened to the following podcast where the guest compared Haskell, Coq etc to the weird stuff you&#x27;d see in a runway show, and that its not really meant for everyone one to wear/use (unless I suppose you are Bjork) but rather to push the envelope. Of course I don&#x27;t agree in entirety. BTW, Not all runway fashion is impractical (example).

                    <span>I created some quick (but literate woo!) scripts to make it easy to automatically tangle and export each time I commit. The generated files are automatically appended to the commit.
 This is handy for generating README.md from README.org which I hope can reduce vendor lock in for org-uses who right now might feel a bit locked into to forgets (like GitHub) that &quot;natively&quot; support Org.

                    <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m fairly new to org-mode, and have just been familiarizing myself with the basics for the past few days. After going through some excellent posts, I decided to try out org-mode for taking down and organizing lecture notes, and thought I could first try it out on a MOOC that I am taking.
 Now to the real question. As someone who has always taken down notes on paper using a pen, I do not plan to move away from it, and infact would like to org-mode to supplement it. Being a grad student in Computer Science, and Engineering, I realize that apart from taking down notes on a paper, I would need to annotate PDFs, to add notes that, have blocks of code from different stages at different points in the notes.
 Thus, I may potentially have upto 5 sources of notes (yes, seems like a lot): (i) a majority on pen-paper, (ii) annotations in a PDF, (iii) normal notes and points in a normal org-mode text window, and (iv) blocks of code and (v) diagrams. Is there a good way to combine these different sources in org-mode and make it seem streamlined and efficient? Essentially, a good workflow for me to add pdf&#x27;s and diagrams/code to my pen-paper notes and organize them. Is it even feasible, as I am still fairly new to org-mode?
 Breaking it to a simpler need, what is the best workflow to integrate lecture slides (with annotations) with handwritten notes? 
 Note: Please don&#x27;t provide answers such as &quot;Just listen in class don&#x27;t take notes constantly, or you will miss out&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m someone who relies on writing a lot to understand information, and pen-paper notes has worked well for me. I would love to supplement it with other sources to make it better :)
 Edit: I have come across org-noter, and though I find it to be cool, I don&#x27;t understand most of it, and it seems for a pro-org-mode user! If someone does suggest it, I&#x27;d highly appreciate it if someone explains what it does for a noob user.

                    <span>Ok I&#x27;m brand new in scala and i&#x27;m having trouble trying to define a function to get an array of all of the neighbors of a given cell in a 500x500 grid. Currently my table is:
  
 Cell: Int num_point: Int 
  
 I would like to make the table:
  
 Cell: Int num_point: Int neighbor_cells: Array[Int] 
  
 I thought I had followed to right formula to create a function but i&#x27;m getting errors everywhere about top level specifiers (which is literally a useless error i might add) I believe what I have done is no different than how the main function is declared but mine just doesn&#x27;t work. Anyone able to help me figure out what&#x27;s up. I set it up as best as I could (coming from a background of C++)

                    <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs + LSP to program in C# and Unity and after using auto-completion several times my memory usage goes above 2GB RAM. Even with garbage-collect the RAM usage only goes to about 2GB and never less. Also, this is not a problem of omnisharp as it&#x27;s memory usage won&#x27;t go above the 100MB RAM.
 How can I fix this?
 This is the memory report before and after using LSP and completions:

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 The title says almost everything. I came across this amazing tool based on remark.js called xaringan, but every single tutorial that I read is based on using Rstudio as the suite to create and visualize the slides.
 I would like to use this library on Emacs, but honestly I am not familiar with R and this is the closest post that I found where they dedicate a single paragraph to say that you can use xaringan on Emacs by using the packages Emacs Speaks Statistics ess combined with surf browser.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Found the working js-doc snippet from here.
 Which outputs to
 /** *  * @param {} port - * @param {[]} methods - * @param {} host - * @return */ var connect &#x3D; function(port, methods, host) { 
 I was just wonder how can I have a dynamic cursor inside the parenthesis and at the last of the line, something like
 /** * $0 * @param {$1} port - $2 * @param {$3} methods - $4 * @param {$5} host - $6 * @return */ var connect &#x3D; function(port, methods, host) { 
 So that I can manually enter the type and description on the dynamic cursor positions. Any idea??

                    <span>Have you suffered from these symptoms...
  
Have you been stuck about when to use setq versus defvar? 
 Does it hurt when you see one allows documentation but not the other?
 
 Do your non-Lisp friends think setq is a strange name to define variables?
 Do your fingers cramp knowing there&#x27;s no unified definition interface for variables &amp; functions?
 Do you want to have an elegant, lightweight, syntax for furnishing functions and variables with runtime type checks? ---Including complex checks between function arguments!
  
Dr. Musa&#x27;s “L”anguage “F”eatures lf-define macro cures all ills!
 Come one, come all! Emacs lisp is a no-holds-barred! ⇒ Repo link ⇐

                    <span>As far as I know the Base type family is used to be able to work with normal recursive types like the standard list type instead of data ListF a b &#x3D; Cons a b | Nil.
 I guess there are alternative approaches, but I lack the appropriate terms to reasearch further. Every tip is appreciated.
 The question arose, because I translate Kmett&#x27;s recursion schemes to my own typed language that unfortunately doesn&#x27;t support type families.

                    <span>I am following Get Programming in Haskell by Will Kurt and in Unit1 Ch.5 closures are introduced.
 Specifically Listing 5.5 shows
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 genHostRequestBuilder host &#x3D;
 (\apiKey resource id -&gt; getRequestURL host apiKey resource id) 
 exampleUrlBuilder &#x3D; genHostRequestBuilder &quot;http://amazon.com&quot;
 genApiRequestBuilder hostBuilder apiKey &#x3D;
 (\resource id -&gt; hostBuilder apiKey resource id)
 myExampleUrlBuilder &#x3D; genApiRequestBuilder exampleUrlBuilder &quot;api-key&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 where closures are being used to make a function that at first accepts host, api key, resource, id as parameters but in the end just the resource and id since the host and api key are often redundant when making api calls to the same site.
 My attempt at the above was different but I&#x27;m able to get the correct answer, ie. a valid url to make an api request
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 exampleUrlBuilder2 &#x3D; exampleUrlBuilder &quot;my-api-key&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Thus it seems like this closure is overly complicated and in the process I discovered that I can create an alias for a function partially applied to one parameter? What is the advantage of the textbook&#x27;s way of using a closure here instead of what I did?

                    <span>Normally take :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] takes the specified number of elements or less, if the list appeared shorter than expected. Now if you wish to distinguish between these cases, you need to check that length (take n xs) &#x3D;&#x3D; n. This is wasteful.
 I&#x27;d like to define takeFoo :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; (Int, [a]), which tells immediately how many elements were successfully taken. What is the best name for such function?
 (If you are wondering about my context, this is actually not about lists, but about Text, where length is very expensive).

 Just wanted to share my final year university project repo which was implementing a language very similar to Elm:
 https://github.com/georgegarrington/Syphon
 Megaparsec used for parser, Hindley-Milner system (albeit I never implemented let polymorphism) based on this Cornell course used for the type system and custom transpiler made without using a string template library, didn&#x27;t know this was a thing until after the deadline haha oops. Transpiles to ES6 making use of arrow functions for currying and uses React and Electron, useReducer hook in React is essentially the Elm architecture so this was used, and useEffect hook was used to implement subscriptions.
 Would love to know anyone&#x27;s feedback at an amateur attempt at language implementation, and also hope this might help people working on a similar project :)

                    <span>Here is a discussion of newtype. Note 
 newtype State s a &#x3D; State { runState :: s -&gt; (s, a) } 
 And then later
 State :: (s -&gt; (s, a)) -&gt; State s a runState :: State s a -&gt; (s -&gt; (s, a)) 
 which I assume are only the type id&#x27;s from doing :t. Good. And I think I understand that since s -&gt; (s, a) , i.e., (s, a) is a tuple, we are not violating the one-parameter restriction of a newtype. But what does s -&gt; (s, a) mean, i.e., what is a function doing in a type declaration? I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve never run across this before. Also, what could this type be used for?

Cast Haskell values with Witch by Taylor Fausak
I’m happy to announce Witch, a library that aims to make those conversions easy and painless. This post will explain my motivation for creating the library and show some examples of how to use it.
Cheap interpreter, part 4: stack machines by Gary Verhaegen
In this post, we’re going to explore a completely different approach: we’re first going to design a stack machine, then write an interpreter for the stack machine language, and finally write a compiler from our toy language parse tree to stack machine instructions.

                    <span>In a major mode, I use general to assign &quot;SPC b b&quot; to command. How do I assign a string to appear under &quot;SPC b&quot; in the which-key popup, only for this specific major mode? My current setup carries the string into other modes, which I don&#x27;t want.
 Currently, I do (something similar to) the following
  (general-create-definer jl/major-modes :keymaps &#x27;(normal visual operator motion) :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; ) (jl/major-modes :keymaps &#x27;org-mode-map &quot;b&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :which-key: &quot;Babel&quot;)) 
 If I have another key under &quot;SPC b _&quot; in another mode, which-key still displays &quot;Babel&quot; as &quot;SPC b&quot;, rather than the usual &quot;prefix&quot;.
 I have tried looking through the documentation for both general.el and which-key, but I can&#x27;t find the correct way to set a prefix string.

 (M-TAB should call the pcomplete command which, when called after the \ character, shows the possible completions e.g. \real, \alpha ecc.)

                    <span>I have some custom keybindings in elfeed to allow me to mark elfeed entries as &quot;starred&quot; or &quot;favorite&quot; but I would also like to add &quot;starred&quot; entries to an Org agenda category such that they will show up in org-agenda/org-super-agenda without doing an org-capture + org-cliplink.
 I&#x27;m thinking perhaps some sort of query of the elfeed database from Org agenda though I&#x27;m not sure how one might go about that... org-ql?
 Anybody come up with a similar flow?

                    <span>hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 I am in the process of tuning my configuration so as to recognise different machines and act upon it - for instance by executing particular functions or loading particular files. For this, I rely upon information outside of emacs such as environment variables and/or the desktop resolution.
 In one function, I was able to successfully use (getenv &quot;HOME&quot;). However, in another function, (getenv &quot;HOST&quot;) evaluates to nil even though echo $HOST does show a legitimate value (though it does not show in printenv funnily enough...). Also, environment variables that I have set in my .zshrc and which show up in printenv cannot be called upon.
 Any tips / tricks are very welcome!
 Have a good day :)

 I don&#x27;t know where to look. I tried searching the error, but I can&#x27;t seems to find anything related.
 My Emacs config is here https://github.com/vfsoraki/emacs.d
 I used Emacs in Linux and Mac, and both have the same problem.
 I&#x27;m using Straight to install and manage my packages. I took a guess and tried loading projectile before Magit, but it did not solve my issue.
 I don&#x27;t know where to look. Any tip on how to debug this will be more than useful, thanks!

 Prodigy: For my job I often have to run various web servers locally, and Prodigy is the best (only?) way that I&#x27;ve found to do that all within Emacs. You can define individual services, and then bring up an overview buffer from which you can start, stop, and view the status of each service. You can also bring up an output buffer for each running service. It has some neat features like being able to define custom statuses for a service that will be triggered based on the output -- for example, when developing locally, I have a couple of services that are set to automatically…</span>

                    <span>Hi
 I want to learn emacs. I am a long time vim user, not planning on learning emacs for just text manipulation.
 I have done some basic elisp coding. But by brain never thinks like lisp.
 Found this amazing video that blew my mind. I am looking for more advanced level emacs/elisp videos, to get over my initial inhibition and think more lisp like. Please share.

                    <span>For a project I&#x27;m working on, I need to parse existing Haskell files into some representation that is able to process them. In a perfect world, there would just be a library that allows for a deep embedding of Haskell inside Haskell. Does something like this exist?
 Maybe I could use parts of ghcide or hls, since they obviously need some way of working with source code, though I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible. (and in case it is, if it&#x27;s a good idea)
 Maybe something like this could be done in template Haskell, but I don&#x27;t know a lot about TH.
 A library that compiles haskell down to System FC would also be fine, though not perfect since I later need to generate haskell.
 Has anybody had a similar task?
 How did you solve it?
 Thanks in advance!

 STORM lets you write expressive and auditable security policies with the data model. The policies are enforced via compile-time refinement type checking with LiquidHaskell.

 Has anybody else faced this? I would think that ideally I should point VS Code extension to the Haskell-stack installed GHC. Not sure how and don&#x27;t know if that is ideal or unnecessary.

 But what I found is that even Java doesn&#x27;t have the same JVM problem! Java is even on par with Rust! (It may not exactly equal though, because the time unit is too large)
 So, what is the cause of slowness in Scala then?

 I do &quot;successful&quot; PKM for more than a decade (check this out http://hg.defun.work/tips/) figuring everything &amp; building tooling around myself.
 I split data into projects each in own Mercurial repository for syncing:
  
private info (contacts, medic records, etc)
 semiprivate info (shops, contractors, equipment)
 tips in RST format (HTML compiler preview: http://tips.defun.work/)
 cooking in RST format
 blog in MD/RST/Asciidoc/txt formats (for curious http://blog.defun.work/)
 dump with WIP blog posts (2MiB of RST text)
 per employer notes each in a single file (contacts, creds, etc) in Org mode
 dump with notes in Org format - everything else goes here
  
I use Org mode only for one reason: it is possible to mark a section as DO…</span>

                    <span>Hi! I started using notmuch in Emacs as my mail client today. It was quite easy to set up and now I have two email inboxes synced via isync. The issue is that notmuch doesn&#x27;t seem to distinguish the two. As the ones I&#x27;m currently using are my private ones, it doesn&#x27;t matter a ton but I&#x27;d like to bring in my (much! more spammy) gmail and school mail, and would therefore like to know if there is an easy way to separate them.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I have a problem related to cosmetics that isn&#x27;t that pressing, but I am frustrated I can&#x27;t figure out it. I&#x27;m on Windows 10 x64 running emacs 27.2 and org 9.4.4.
 I&#x27;ve added 
 (setq org-ellipsis &quot; ▾&quot;) 
 to my .emacs
 After loading that, when I open an .org file, the character shows up as &quot; â¾&quot; ; same for with describe-variable -&gt; org-ellipsis. I visit my .emacs, M-x eval-buffer and then reopen the org file and it&#x27;s fixed. 
 Any ideas? Is there something weird with encoding?
 I wondered if the font used in my headings didn&#x27;t support that character, but &quot;C-x 8 RET 25be&quot; types it no problem in either default font used in my .org files.
 seems a similar issue occurred with this person as well: although I have not messed with its face settings on purpose https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48272/org-mode-ellipsis-arrow-is-not-using-my-defined-encoding-utf-8

                    <span>I am trying to compile emacs directly from the repo (not from a tar release). I checkout master and run:
  ./autogen.sh ./configure make  But I get the following error:  In toplevel form: shadowfile.el:77:1:Error: Recursive load: &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot; make[2]: *** [Makefile:296: shadowfile.elc] Error 1 make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... make[2]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp&#x27; make[1]: *** [Makefile:319: compile-main] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp&#x27; make: *** [Makefile:411: lisp] Error 2  This happens even when I compile from a commit tagged as a release, e.g. emacs-27.1 emacs-27.2. Compiling from a tar release works fine. (tried this on versions 27.1 and 27.2)
 I&#x27;m using Archlinux, kernel 5.12.4-arch1-2
 Note: I am a very new emacs (spacemacs) user and I am not very experienced in the patching/development process in general.

                    <span>The 2-character indentation on plain lists doesn&#x27;t work well for me, it makes it tougher to read the structure of deeply nested lists.
 - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. - Aenean fringilla, neque ut malesuada mollis, elit ex cursus sem, in accumsan justo turpis sed nibh. - Nunc mollis nunc eu faucibus viverra. - Quisque condimentum interdum lorem, vel ultricies arcu suscipit at. - Integer dolor augue, pharetra sit amet augue ac, fringilla blandit leo. Curabitur a consequat purus, sed consequat ligula. - Nam vel blandit sem, ac mattis nisi. Aenean vel consequat ipsum. - Suspendisse sed ipsum porta, tincidunt urna vitae, semper arcu. - Cras vitae mollis augue. - Duis vestibulum at diam eu sollicitudin. 
 Is there a way to get org-mode to display plain list indentation with more depth, similar to what org-indent-indentation-per-leveldoes for headings?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi All,
 ​
 Apologies for the question. I have tried searching about this problem, but posts I found do not seem to be the exact same issue.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/lurdquh8r3b71.png?width&#x3D;733&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a3c5f764e216a873f2473dee877aafb9dec36bbb
 The screenshot above shows that I am unable to use any of my linters from python even though they have been installed in my environment, which I use conda.el to manage.
 When I run M-: (executable-find &quot;flake8&quot;), it actually does show the flake8 executable from the correct anaconda environment. I am thus unsure why flycheck is unable to find any of the executables from my linters. 
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>I am trying to make a package that generates a type specimen for a font. In short:
  
Prompt user for a font family (e.g. from font-family-list)
 Open temp buffer into which I generate strings, in the font, in various sizes
  
I can do this easily enough for ASCII characters by doing
 (insert (propertize &quot;Lorem ipsum&quot; &#x27;face &#x60;(:family ,font))) 
 And this does work for non-ASCII characters under emacs -Q.
 However for my personal config I have customized the default fontset to use various fonts according to charset or script:
 (set-fontset-font t &#x27;han &quot;MyCjkFont&quot;) 
 In the presence of this customization I find that no matter what I do, MyCjkFont is always used for characters in han. I&#x27;ve tried making custom fontsets, playing with faces, etc., but nothing has worked.
 The type specimen should be ephemeral and self-contained, so I don&#x27;t want to modify the default fontset when generating it (doing so would affect all other windows/buffers, and the changes would persist after killing the specimen).
 Is there a way to do this?

                    <span>Hi there, I have practiced Scala in leetcode for very simple problem, merged two sorted list. And try using Scala, Python and Rust. It surprise me that Scala is way slower and consume more memory than Python! 
 runtime and memory usage of various programming language
 At first, I have implemented the recursive (652 ms) and changed to imperative one to squeeze its performance (464 ms). But its performance still lower than python anyway. Below is the code that I wrote in Scala in imperative style. (Python code is written almost exactly the same)
 // class ListNode(_x: Int &#x3D; 0, _next: ListNode &#x3D; null) { // var next: ListNode &#x3D; _next // var x: Int &#x3D; _x // } def mergeTwoLists(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode): ListNode &#x3D; { var ll1 &#x3D; l1 var ll2 &#x3D; l2 var result &#x3D; ListNode(0) var cur_res &#x3D; result while (ll1 !&#x3D; null || ll2 !&#x3D; null) { if (ll1 &#x3D;&#x3D; null) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ll2 ll2 &#x3D; null } else if (ll2 &#x3D;&#x3D; null) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ll1 ll1 &#x3D; null } else if (ll1.x &gt; ll2.x) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ListNode(ll2.x) ll2 &#x3D; ll2.next } else { cur_res.next &#x3D; ListNode(ll1.x) ll1 &#x3D; ll1.next } cur_res &#x3D; cur_res.next } return result.next } 
 What is the cause of this? Or Scala is actually slower than Python?

                    <span>As part of my Tweag fellowship, I developed dingo,
a Python package to analyze metabolic networks. dingo provides three methods
that complement the openCOBRA project. The main
advantage of dingo is the efficient implementation
of new sampling algorithms that generate steady states of metabolic networks.
In this post, I’ll explain what this all means and even discuss how
we can use this tool to discover new COVID-19 treatments.
Also check out the audio interview with Apostolos about dingo on the Compositional podcast!
Metabolic networks and COVID-19

                    <span>Does anyone use a zettelkasten for their day-to-day work? For example, taking notes on meetings and the like?
I&#x27;m curious. In my role I find my reading notes often come in handy because I am asked to articulate a position or make some recommendation on something, but I think it would feel strange to start to have a mass of notes on the internal workings of my employer. I wonder if this is something people do, or if they keep it more for personal projects (or for those spaces where the personal and professional overlap).</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 TL;DR: How to get M-. and M-, to work in geiser / guile the way they work for emacs lisp?
 I hope I chose the right community to ask this. Feel free to tell me if I didn&#x27;t, and suggest where to ask otherwise. I am an aspiring lisp / scheme hacker. One thing that I would really get into is gnu guix, the distro which is powered by the guile programming language. 
 So far, all my attempts to combine emacs and geiser whilst hacking guix have gone suboptimally. The main thing that doesn&#x27;t work for me is the ability to jump to a symbol&#x27;s definition using M-. or M-,. This is what I have used browsing emacs lisp code, and I feel this is instrumental to learning the language and how stuff works when you kinda know the basics, but not more than that.
 Thus, I would love to know how I would have to set guile and geiser up so that I will be able to use that most useful function.
 Maybe I am missing something super obvious here that I have not mentioned. Please, if this is the case, feel free to point me to it!
 Have a good day, fellows!

                    <span>Hi all, just wanted to share a thing I made for creating nicer org ids to link to.
 The good thing about org ids is that they allow linking to headlines even if you move things around (when you split off a headline into a new file, say). The bad thing is the ids are UUIDs meaning they contain no information whatsoever on what they’re actually for. This is annoying when you’re editing a link (IMHO).
 So I made something that creates human readable links. This turns out to be a bit involved, as generating UUIDs is stuck somewhere deep inside another function you really don’t want to mess with (separation of concerns apparently is not a thing in org-id code?).
 What it does is when you store a link ( C-c l) it checks whether there already is an ID property. If there isn’t, it creates a new on…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written something that I wish existed when I was at the beginning of exploring emacs: a full breakdown of how I program in emacs (vue, react, python,etc), how I use org-mode to organize my todos and time tracking, and how I do basic IDE stuff like search and replace, window management, etc in emacs. I&#x27;ve also included installation and configuration instructions for everything I do in emacs. 
 According to my clock-table, this apparently took me 24 hours and 39 minutes to write lol. We&#x27;re in lockdown here in Taiwan so there&#x27;s shit else to do. 
 Anyway here&#x27;s the link
 I don&#x27;t have any kind of ads or tracking on my blog, I don&#x27;t know really what my objective is for maintaining it but I feel a compulsion to do so and it feels productive to write blogposts, so I&#x27;m not going to question it further /shrug

                    <span>I&#x27;m attempting to use tramp to edit files on the raspberry pi, how do I get it to work? I&#x27;m typing C-x C-f &#x27;/ssh:rootUsername@ip:/&#x27;, but the second I type the final slash, emacs freezes until I press C-g. What could I be doing wrong? I should add I&#x27;ve shared ssh keys, which works flawlessly in the terminal.

 Edit: fix was found here: https://blog.karssen.org/2016/03/02/fixing-emacs-tramp-mode-when-using-zsh/

 needed to use it on the local and remote shell (which both use zsh)!

gist
  
I recently made a post about deriving GADTs with DerivingVia and it got me thinking if I could implement generic definitions without so much boilerplate. The standard way of defining such a generic instance with GHC.Generics is to define a type class
 class GBinaryPut f where gput :: f t -&gt; Put 
 with an instance for each of the polynomial functor building blocks
 instance GBinaryPut V1 where gput _ &#x3D; pure () instance GBinaryPut U1 where gput U1 &#x3D; pure () instance (GBinaryPut a, GBinaryPut b) &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (a :*: b) where gput (x :*: y) &#x3D; gput x  gput y instance GBinaryPut a &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (M1 i c a) where gput &#x3D; gput . unM1 instance Binary a &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (K1 i a) where gput &#x3D; put . unK1 
 So I thought if there was a nicer way of writing this. generics-sop alread…</span>

                    <span>Essentially, a friend of mine was like &quot;How do you even read a file in a purely functional language?&quot;
 So I sat down with him and wrote a program that is essentially the cat tool without all the bloat like --help and stuff: take filename in, read the file, print it out. And that program literally takes two lines of Haskell code. It came out so concise without me even trying that I just had to share it with you.
 import System.Environment (getArgs) main &#x3D; getArgs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (readFile . head) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn 
 It&#x27;s actually just one line of useful code if you exclude the import statement. Show me a language that can do it more elegantly! I&#x27;ll wait...

                    <span>Today I was writing some code with newtypes. I was writing code with the whole unwrap-modify-wrap pattern.
 ​
 newtype Foo &#x3D; Foo { unFoo :: Char } myFunc &#x3D; Foo . doSomething . unFoo 
 I had another newtype. Pretty soon I had single lines with multiple wrappings and unwrappings. E.g.:
 newtype Bar &#x3D; Bar { unBar :: String } somePolymorphicFunc :: Int -&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] modify (Bar . somePolymorphicFunc x (unFoo y) . unBar) 
 I didn&#x27;t like this line. Then it hit me: dealing with newtypes was supposed to be a solved problem. Instead I could write:
 ​
 modify (coerce somePolymorphicFunc x y) 
 And it would magically work, right?
 ​
 Wrong. While GHC could tell I wanted to turn somePolymorphicFunc into an Int -&gt; Bar -&gt; Foo -&gt; Foo, it didn&#x27;t know what type to coerce it from. I&#x27;d have to write.

                    <span>As I continue to dig into continuations I wondered if I could add shift and reset to LogicT. The immediate problem I ran into is that LogicT uses a forall r. internally and so even though you can write shift and reset, you can&#x27;t actually use the lambda you get from calling shift.
 So the first thing I did was to change LogicT to expose r:
 newtype LogicT r m a &#x3D; LogicT { unLogicT :: (a -&gt; m r -&gt; m r) -&gt; m r -&gt; m r} 
 Then I quickly copied over a bunch of the definitions in Control.Monad.Logic no problem. I had to generalize the types of course to add r but it was trivial to do. There&#x27;s a few things I haven&#x27;t converted yet like msplit, but I don&#x27;t expect to run into any issues.
 I ended up with these shift/reset operators:
 resetT :: MonadFail m &#x3D;&gt; LogicT r m r -&gt; LogicT r&#x27; m r resetT &#x3D; lif…</span>

                    <span>Heya all.
 I have a long history as a software developer, both in commercial environments and in academic research labs (mostly C, Scheme/LISP, Python, some Java). Back in 2013 I got into Spark and Scala working for a startup and kind of burned out by 2015. I decided to try new things and bought a farm and spent the last 5-6 years growing food, working outside etc. However, I find myself wanting to go back and at least pick up contracts/gigs to make some additional income, invest more into my retirement etc.
 It has been 6 years since I looked at Scala and I know things have changed since.
 A few questions: 1) what is the easiest/best way to get back in the game and refresh/catch up on everything that happened in the language? and 2) will anyone even consider me after a multi-year unrelated gap in my resume? When I &quot;retired&quot;, I was at the senior level but obviously do not expect to get back at that level (no ego here). What is the best way to approach this - where do I look, how do I approach potential employers?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I just started doing journals after learning Emacs and Org for a week, and I&#x27;ve settled on a style that works for me as someone with ADHD. I&#x27;d like to be able to start a new weekly journal with the same style as I&#x27;ve made myself, just to save some work and keep things consistent. I know I&#x27;d have to edit my .emacs for this, and the syntax mostly makes sense to me, but I have no idea where to start. Any help is appreciated, thank you!
 The template I&#x27;d like to set, with the dates automatically set for the week each time:

 Sometimes when I want to reply to an email in mu4e, the whole Emacs freezes and I need to kill it. I don&#x27;t know what triggers it but it is 100% reproducible on certain emails. For the rest, everything works fine.
 Do you have some suggestions, please?

                    <span>I used to use neotree, and recently switched to treemacs. I like treemacs find. It seems to be the new thing people are using. Spacemacs seems to have shifted to it by default. BUT there&#x27;s one big flaw IMHO: With neotree, the file tree for the project that I was currently in appeared; with treemacs, a whole set of projects appear other than the one that I am working in. This adds extra noise and in some cases is just inconvenient because I have to worry about adding/removing projects.
 Is there any way to get treemacs to behave a bit more like neotree?

                    <span>Hello! I often create keyboard macros to (for example) run capitalize-region over org/outline headings, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to generalise this class of tasks. 2 possible solutions might be:
 (1.) A (with-visible-region ...) macro, which &quot;maps&quot; its body over visible portions of the current region.
 Or (2.) A &quot;Narrow to visible portion(s) of region&quot; - I have no idea if narrowed buffers can show multiple subsets of a buffer, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve seen some occur-like modes do this and keep the selections editable.
 I&#x27;d prefer the first solution, and it&#x27;s probably easy to implement, but thought I&#x27;d ask about prior art first :) always good to learn new tricks.

                    <span>Hello!
 I am trying to use dap-mode for debugging c/cpp/rust. I cannot find any way to break on abort.
 It should be possible to add a breakpoint at abort() but I cannot figure out how to add this breakpoint without going to the stdlib.h file and adding the breakpoint there.
 My config for dap-mode
 ;; Debug Adapter Protocol through dap-mode (use-package dap-mode :ensure t :config ;; On a new system need to call &#x60;dap-gdb-lldb-setup&#x60; to setup the ;; vscode extension automagically (require &#x27;dap-gdb-lldb) ;; Bind &#x60;C-c l d&#x60; to &#x60;dap-hydra&#x60; for easy access (general-define-key :keymaps &#x27;lsp-mode-map :prefix lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;d&quot; &#x27;(dap-hydra t :wk &quot;debugger&quot;))) 
 Thanks in advance :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been committing myself to use org mode more. One thing I&#x27;d like to do is integrate diagrams for some of the systems I&#x27;m responsible for and for personal coding projects. 
 I&#x27;ve been considering using LucidChart as the diagram editor, but I&#x27;m open to other suggestions as well. 
 Overall, how do you render both PNGs and asci-text style diagrams in org mode blocks and Github READMEs?

                    <span>I&#x27;m storing my tags files in the .git folder for each Git repository, using a variant of this method, with the tags file at the path .git/etags. I would like Emacs to automatically locate and use the tags file, and it should be local to the buffer, because I will probably have files from different repositories open at once.
 This is what I came up with:
 (add-hook &#x27;find-file-hook (lambda () (let* ((tagspath &quot;.git/etags&quot;) (git-root (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name) tagspath))) (if git-root (visit-tags-table (expand-file-name tagspath git-root) 1))))) 
 I&#x27;m very new to Emacs (started using it around a week ago), so I figured there must be a better way to do this. Any ideas/suggestions?

                    <span>Hi! This post is mostly to share my joy from making something cool and useful for myself. I started with emacs about a year ago, and have been kinda stuck in a beginner state since then. I&#x27;m a math teacher, not a programmer, and emacs is a little side hobby that I haven&#x27;t spent enough time really learning, in order to reap the benefits of being able to make it do whatever I want. But this last week I put in some time, and I learned a lot, and now I have a cool thing, and I feel like I&#x27;m finally on the road to emacs wizardry.
 Here&#x27;s the problem I want to solve: I have a lot of students, and there are a ton of things I want to remember about each one of them. For example, Bobbo has missed a lot of class the last few weeks, he told me his mom is sick, and I gave him an extension for an assig…</span>

 My app connects to RabbitMQ, and then waits to keep the connection running. Is there a way to wait, that is not dependent on the stdin?

                    <span>I have often wished that I could subscribe to RSS feeds that notify me when new books are published about a certain topic or by a certain author. I recently implemented the idea in the article system of my personal website and created an index of Haskell books.
 https://www.extrema.is/articles/haskell-books
 The index provides a simple UI for browsing by tag, and each book page has basic information and links. By subscribing to the following RSS feed, you get a notification when a new book is added to the index.
 https://www.extrema.is/articles/tag/index:haskell-books.rss
 This is a humble first implementation, but I am posting here in case others find it useful.

 I&#x27;d like to be able to paste a conversation from Slack into an Org document and have it include the formatting from Slack. At a minimum, I&#x27;d like links to work, but it&#x27;d be great if all of the text formatting pasted properly into Org as well.
 Does anyone know of a solution for this?

                    <span>Hi, sorry for the noob question. I have a document with a numbered list like this: 
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/zoa6kdgausa71.png?width&#x3D;1872&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;1580037bf5221e979af64f7a9f26eafdb7bafa49
 As you can see on the left, its numbered correctly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). but on the latex doc its (1, 1, 1, 1), is there a way to have the proper numbering while exporting?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m struggling with configuration of metals for emacs on my new laptop with ubuntu that I use at work. I&#x27;ve installed metals via coursier, but when I open a Scala project and use some lsp-metals command Emacs says it&#x27;s not a metals workspace. I use the same emacs config I use on my private Arch PC where everything works fine. Got any thoughts what might be a problem?

                    <span>I am a newbie in Machine Learning Engineer field from Thailand and only have to deal with python and its machine learning package in my profession like pyspark and sk-learn. I would like to expand my skill set by doing side project on the AIoT fields (raspberry pi, backend and frontend) with another programming language which have higher performance.
 At first, I think Rust is the interesting choice as raspberry pi has limited resources and very fun to code.
 But, I am more interested in the new announced Scala 3 since it is the language being used in many of the data science fields. It has Scala.js which can be implemented on frontend. And it is very fun to code in functional style.
 However, in Thailand, the Scala jobs is nearly non-existent.
  
But what about Scala popularity in other countries?
 Any thought on the Scala 3 full stack?
 If Scala is not popular, I would like to hear the reason too.
 And what about Rust popularity in other countries?
  
Thanks in advance for your opinion everyone!

 For those who haven&#x27;t used it yet, ScalablyTyped is a converter that provides an SBT plugin to convert typescript definition to usable ScalaJS types. It is definitely one of the most important projects to the ScalaJS ecosystem, and looks to me as if it&#x27;s maintained by a single person right now. 
 Hopefully this can get some more awareness out for this awesome project and people can drop some thanks toward the author (who I am not).

                    <span>Hello Everyone. I&#x27;m using Emacs everywhere - on my linux laptop and work mac laptop, and whenever I get a chance I&#x27;ll use my large monitor for better screen real estate. I&#x27;m determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.
 I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I&#x27;m not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).
 I&#x27;m just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type &quot;darwin&quot;). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.
 ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (&gt; (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list &#x27;initial-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-11&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-14&quot;))) 
 Then, it occurred to me that I&#x27;m not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?
 In the meantime, I&#x27;m off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won&#x27;t need to ask for this kind of help in the future. Much appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all, is there a variable or config I can set in emacs-dashboard that will use relative file paths? Right now I have both a windows and a linux emacs I&#x27;m trying to learn/use org-mode for and the Windows recentf file that&#x27;s storing the recent files to display uses absolute paths and it&#x27;s linked via a pcloud directory so it ruins the recents on my linux homedirectoy mirror.

 evil mode
 ​
 I also want to make something new for emacs.
 But i dont know how to start and not only start,
 I dont know how to make these projects production based. 
 I&#x27;m doing solely for community purpose to like emacs.
 I need your help.
 ​
 ​
 If you have made any emacs popular packages,
 would you please give me your story how you made it? 
 What resources did you followed to master it?
 Please provide a detail, which sites did you gone , which did you followed , 
 while learning to make packages and learn.
 ​
 ​
 I&#x27;m asking this because when i learn books on emacs, I would only know basic instead of making some project based practical extension, I will be stuck like i&#x27; here learning python and not making anything. 
 ​
 PLEASE HELP

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell itself and its development ecosystem. I&#x27;m trying to setup a Haskell Language Server for Neovim 0.5 (with native LSP support). Previously I was using CoC and HLS that I installed via ghcup and it worked just fine. Now with new version of Neovim I stopped using CoC and trying to make HLS work with native LSP. I have no idea on how to make my already installed HLS work together with native LSP, so I tried to install HLS via lspinstall plugin, but I always get the same error:
 ghcide compiled against GHC 8.10.5 but currently using 8.10.4 This is unsupported, ghcide must be compiled with the same GHC version as the project.
 I checked a version of &#x60;ghc&#x60; (with ghc -v) on my machine the output is:
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.5
 I also tried to create a new project with stack new ... to check if that issue persists there and it does.
 Does anybody have similar issues?
 If anybody could share his way of configuring Neovim LSP + HLS that would be great!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Played around with a nice TH tutorial posted here not a long ago.
 I&#x27;ve just copy-pasted relevant code snippets from the article - definitions for relevant generateTupleBoilerplate, generateTupleClass and generateTupleInstance - here is the source. Then in the main module used it for generating 62(current limit) type classes for tuples and their instances - source.
 My question: is that normal for such simple program GHC consumes really huge memory ~1.2 GiB at compilation, while full web-application project based on Servant takes about 400 MiB at max? Talking about RSS memory footprint, tested with GHC 9.0.1 . Either loading in ghci REPL or compiling with ghc -O makes no difference.
 Is this a known issue with TH extension or template-haskell package &amp; its dependencies?

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to build a Set with do-notation, ala []
 bars :: Set Bar basz :: Set Baz foos :: Set Foo foos &#x3D; do bar  (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b fmap &#x3D; Set.map return &#x3D; Set.singleton ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; mf &#x3D; Set.unions $ Set.map mf ma 
 And this makes everything work! Very cool, QualifiedDo doing QualifiedDo things. However, it&#x27;s clear that foo doesn&#x27;t require the full power of a monad. ApplicativeDo, here we come. Turn it on, implement some bindings
 pure &#x3D; Set.singleton ma  mb &#x3D; ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \f -&gt; Set.map f mb 
 and....bummer
 • Could not deduce (Ord (Baz -&gt; Foo)) arising from a do statement (maybe you haven&#x27;t applied a function to enough arguments?) 
 which unfortunately makes total sense. ApplicativeDo desugars into
 foos &#x3D; (\bar baz -&gt; mkFoo bar baz)  bars  bazs 
 which is trying to use fmap to make an intermediate Set (Baz -&gt; Foo). However, I cannot see a theoretical reason this could not desugar into this instead
 foos &#x3D; liftA2 mkFoo bars bazs 
 given a binding
 liftA2 :: Ord c&#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b -&gt; Set c liftA2 f as bs &#x3D; Set.map (uncurry f) (Set.cartesianProduct as bs) 
 So it seems like what I want to do is not unsound, but is not possible given how ApplicativeDo works. Am I wrong? If I am, what can I do? If not, has this limitation of ApplicativeDo been discussed anywhere else? Thanks!

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say we have a custom object that uses BlazeClientBuilder. I want to create a Resource out of that custom type, meanwhile properly acquiring and releasing BlazeClientBuilder. How can I do that? I know BlazeClientBuilder has its own Resource implementation, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an access to the respective phases.

                    <span>Reading Christian Tietze&#x27;s and Sascha Fast&#x27;s blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.
I figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain&#x27;s presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.
I decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.
From looking at his setup, I&#x27;d have to track the following:
Total from a year
Total from the first to the fourth quarters
Monthly average
Weekly average
Number of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it
Daily average
Number of days in which I get my daily average or above it
He tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.
My problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn&#x27;t talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?
Really appreciate any help you can give me.</span>

 Unicode CJK text (top) converted to PS file (bottom)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for CJK Unicode text. Now you can print CJK Unicode text using TrueType fonts (Google&#x27;s Noto Serif CJK font in the image) .
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>org-attach, for some reason, splits the ID into two parts before creating the path for your attachments:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no (org-attach-dir-from-id &quot;748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : /home/user/org/.attach/74/8ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Instead of something like this:
 /home/user/org/.attach/748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Is this the standard behavior or am I experiencing a bug? If this is the standard behavior, is there a reason behind it?
 EDIT:
 I found the function responsible for it and it seems intentional:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) &quot;Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.&quot; (format &quot;%s/%s&quot; (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2))) 
 But I&#x27;m still not sure why it is designed this way. Is there a special meaning to the first 2 characters of a UUID?

 When I started this journey I did not find much material on this topic so this is my reference guide after 1 month of experiments. The coolest part is obviously running emacs on it and connecting it with UNIX tooling.

This means that many of my most frequent commands, such as C-x C-s, are a real stretch (QWERTY C-b C-;). How have any of the esteemed Dvorak emacsers reading this made peace with these C-x problems?

                    <span>Is there a function in lsp-mode, or ccls directly to find the compilation command associated with the file (if any) in the current buffer? If not, would another package (rtags, ede-compdb, irony-cdb) help query the compilation database without needing to use the rest of the package? The main use case is to plug it into other tools such as rmsbolt and templight that &quot;compile&quot; code to provide additional information.
 ccls-specific: Can the ccls cache for the current project be queried to obtain a list of all the files currently cached/indexed? If so, can it provide the compilation command associated with each of those files? This would help tremendously with header files in C++ or C.

                    <span>Hi all,
 After reading a lot of posts here and on other place in www I started using Caps and Return long-press as Ctrl. It&#x27;s really nice to have two Ctrl on my Mac without disrupting Caps and Return key. I am using Karabiner BTW to do it.
 This creates a new problem for me where if I press Ctrl with my pinky then it is really awkward to press save and close shortcuts (C-x C-s or C-x C-c). When Ctrl was in corner it was natural to use index and middle finger for those shortcuts but with Caps as Ctrl it feels a bit of stretch to use middle finger for s and index finger for x. That loweing the finger is also not very comfortable.
 Where am I going wrong with my finger placement?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a library for dealing with times and dates far in the past ~1200-1650 A.D.
 I&#x27;m familiar with time and hodatime, but they&#x27;re not really what I&#x27;m looking for.
 I&#x27;d like support for inputting/outputting Julian calendar and Muslim calendar dates, but that&#x27;s not strictly speaking necessary.

This is the first library that I&#x27;m considering uploading to Hackage. Would greatly appreciate any feedback!

                    <span>I&#x27;m a new comer to PureScript, Haskell and other functional programming languages.
 I&#x27;m reading TaPL and want to implement a parser for the untyped lambda calculus in Part I.
 I want to parse the source code with its context which records the names of variables. In Parsec, the parser library in Haskell, there is a parameter u standing for the user-defined state type. On the other hand, there is no such parameter in Parser in purescript-parsing.
 Should I rewrite a parser library with states, or is there a good method to join states with parsers?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve just created two pairs of video/blog post that show you how you can prove the absence of an implicit/given instance at compile time.
 First pair in Scala 3 with the NotGiven feature: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HQojyuZK-Uo with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-givens/
 And the second pair in Scala 2 (and early versions of Scala 3.x with implicits), which is much more general (and more dangerous): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;m9LH0hvahcQ with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-implicits/

                    <span>Crazy question, but is there any way I can pipe the output from ansi-term directly into org mode to then format it on the fly into a table?
 I ask this because I often have to look at logs for work, and though &#x27;CSV-Mode&#x27; has helped for some logs, its not that great on an actual client&#x27;s backend system (CentOS).
 Would love to hear some thoughts on this because so far I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;Line-Mode&#x27; in ansi-term to just copy and paste, make tables on the fly with &#x27;C-c |&#x27; but thought maybe this could be done a bit easier and more direct INSIDE my org mode doc notes.
 ​
 Thanks!

                    <span>When I open a remote shell and try to type anything, there is a super long pause (10-15 sec) before autocomplete shows up. I tried disabling company-shell and company, and things return to normal when both are disabled.
 What&#x27;s going on that&#x27;s making it so slow?

                    <span>I use mu4e with Outlook email for work, and was informed that we would be moving mandatorily to Duo two-factor authentication.
 Apparently Duo is incompatible with IMAP, so I am considering my options.
 I wanted to check whether anyone has crossed this hurdle successfully and has any advice---thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a switch back to linux after quite a long time away (from before switching to emacs).
 Most stuff just worked but I have a few issues. Specifically right now the thing that is bugging me is different behavior for end-of-buffer. 
 On Mac OS I can jump to the end (or beginning) of a buffer with no issue. On linux the command works and appears to be the same (looked up via C-h k) but in addition to the jump it defines a region in the process. 
 It&#x27;s giving me the behavior that&#x27;s I&#x27;d get on my old machine if I set the mark then jumped. 
 If there&#x27;s a setting somewhere I&#x27;m not seeing it... any ideas?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve found all-the-icons-install-fonts to be ineffective under MacOS 11.2.3.
 I see emacs successfully installing font files under home and running fc-cache:
 $ ls -al ~/Library/Fonts/ ... -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 44732 Jul 8 21:06 all-the-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 489672 Jul 8 21:06 file-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 152796 Jul 8 21:06 fontawesome.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 128180 Jul 8 21:06 material-design-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 52544 Jul 8 21:06 octicons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 99564 Jul 8 21:06 weathericons.ttf 
 However, at runtime, those fonts are not picked up and garbled international characters are shown instead of the icons.
 The solution I found was to forcefully copy all these ttf files into /Library/Fonts(i.e., the system-wide font directory).
 Once in the system wide Fonts directory, emacs successfully picks up fonts with no troubles.
 Please advise if you know a cleaner solution.

                    <span>I wonder what happened to abo-abo, the author of ivy and swiper.
 Since 2015 he made at least one contribution on github, but since beginning of June there seems to be no activity. While this is usual for some users like me, it looks unusual for Oleh.
 I hope he is doing well.

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping this is a simple started project b/c my ELisp is a bit basic. If I&#x27;m biting off more than I can chew, please let me know. I&#x27;ve written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I&#x27;m okay, but I&#x27;m not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn&#x27;t depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn&#x27;t come with a REPL.
 I&#x27;m currently use Octave in a literate mode and it&#x27;s pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure&#x27;s case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.
 Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/
 The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like
 clj -Sdeps &quot;{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \&quot;0.11.935\&quot;}}}&quot; 
 Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.
 I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el
 It seems relatively straightforward - but I&#x27;m unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I&#x27;m okay if this only works on Linux)
 Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know. I don&#x27;t want to have to sink a month into this

                    <span>Howdy all!
 I wrote a WAV editor (GUI application) in Haskell which targets long-form narration audio. I&#x27;m releasing a public beta for it and thought I&#x27;d share here.
 It weighs in at ~9kloc and uses the SDL2 gaming lib for graphics and audio playback. The architecture uses a hybrid of OOP and functional techniques: the Model-View-Presenter pattern with FRP (via netwire) driving the UI interactivity.
 The codebase isn&#x27;t super polished and I&#x27;ve yet to write tests, so there&#x27;s bound to be cruft, but any feedback would be appreciated -- do let me know if I did anything exceedingly stupid (besides not writing tests yet, that is)!
 Resources:
  
osabe.app (consumer site)
 dev blog
 code repo
 @osabe_app on Twitter for release announcements, etc.
 @paul_schnapp on Twitter for dev discussion
  
There are a few things I could use some help with if anyone has the time and expertise:
  
There appears to be a slow memory leak with unevaluated thunks that I can&#x27;t nail down (I think somewhere in the Presenter, though possibly the Model)
 I&#x27;m having trouble nicely packaging the app with all the libs it needs on Mac

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on the effectful library and I&#x27;ve encountered that function of such shape is helpful for lifting monadic actions where m r shows in invariant position (e.g. like the unmask callback within mask).
 Hoogle search returns no results.
 The exact signature looks like this:
 withLiftH :: IOE :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; ((forall a b localEs. (IO a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; Eff localEs a -&gt; Eff localEs b) -&gt; Eff es r) -&gt; Eff es r 
 withLiftH is a working name, but perhaps there is a better name for this function?
 EDIT: Never mind, I realized this function is too permissive and will subtly break when misused with multiple threads (e.g. because you can happily use it to lift forkIO) considering the internal representation of Eff. My previous idea was a bit more complicated, but it&#x27;ll work reliably.
 I thought I could make the API a bit nicer, but this just won&#x27;t do.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s cut to the chase, I have been working with Javascript, Python and recently elixir. I found Elixir incredibly fun, easy to understand and much less verbose than using javascript. Recently I found watched escape from the ivory tower on the Haskell website and was more than intrigued. My concern is that, given that I only have limited time to dedicate to studying after work, should I work focus on Haskell or Elixir. Personally I would love to learn Haskell, but I want to make sure I learn something I will use, otherwise I won&#x27;t improve at it.

                    <span>Hello org-community,
 does anyone have a workaround/fix for the following issue:
 When exporting a document via the latex-backend footnotes inside of verse-blocks are not resolved correctly:
 #+begin_verse lorem ipsum dolor sit amet[fn::This is a footnote] #+end_verse 
 results in the .tex file as
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext[]{This is a footnote} 
 This has the irritating result that in the pdf the footnote is numbered with whatever  is given by the automatic export.
 The expected result would be (at least I think so)
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext{This is a footnote} 
 At the moment I&#x27;m stuck with deleting every [] argument – which works, but is obviously tedious.
 About the document: It is written in a report/book class, so numbering starts anew, when a new chapter is begun. otherwise it probably would stay unnoticed.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

 P.S.: User of Doom-emacs. But that shouldn&#x27;t matter.

                    <span>Greetings fellow orgonians,
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out if it&#x27;s possible to use org mode to represent repeating calendar events. In typical calendars, repeating events can be specified with rrules. However, while I see that org mode has repeaters, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to do several things that I can do with rrules.
 Examples:
 (1) repeat on the last day of every month
 (2) repeat on every 1st and 15th day of every month
 (3) repeat every Mon, Wed, Fri
 ​
 Is it possible to encode these repeat patterns in org mode? If so, how?
 If not, is there some extension package which enriches org mode with more sophisticated datetime patterns?
 Thanks in advance for any info you can offer!

                    <span>My personal keybindings, installed at Emacs start-up as a global minor mode, are numerous and a disorganized mess. That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. 
 I&#x27;m aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. 
 I&#x27;m also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so disliked. It&#x27;s essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can&#x27;t go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.
 An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. 
 Am I overlooking any packages? I&#x27;m facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I&#x27;ve never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is. Kudos to the Spacemacs folks, who have won so many converts to Emacs just as Magit and Org have. 
 I put my fate into the hands of r/emacs.

                    <span>I want to insert a link to a local file via a relative path so that the link still works on other computers my emacs project is synced with. 
 C-c C-l gives a list of options for inserting a link, and three of the options are &quot;file&quot;, &quot;file+sys&quot;, and &quot;file+emacs&quot;. Can anyone explain the differences between these three link types and which would be most portable?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I just concluded the first phase of work on a voice-control mode, serenade-mode. There&#x27;s not yet a demo video, but you can check out Serenade&#x27;s homepage to see what Serenade is capable of, it&#x27;s pretty impressive stuff. I&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback/code review on this since it&#x27;s my first mode, before I begin a Spacemacs layer that will extend it (I&#x27;m a Spacemacs/evil user, and outside that it hasn&#x27;t really been tested). Also, if anybody has suggestions or wants to contribute, that would be great!

                    <span>I use gnus, and I&#x27;ve been learning about org-capture. I like what I&#x27;ve seen several people do, which is to create a capture template for responding to emails. Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.
 It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.
 The &#x27;just as if...&#x27; is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don&#x27;t happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.
 Even if it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).
 I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?
 How might I do this? Any ideas would be great. TIA!

                    <span>I created a script to allow me to run multiple Emacsen on Mac. I basically create another folder in/Applications like Emacs1.app and link most things in from Emacs.app. I use a different icon for each Emacs so I can tell them apart. I like this arrangement because I can have only related files open in each Emacs or have different searches or find buffers in different Emacs apps. This of course can’t use emacsclient so you don’t get any boost starting Emacs but I don’t care since I leave them running for days or weeks. If anybody wants this script I can share it. I got the different icons from the Homebrew Emacs Plus project. If everyone thinks this is a stupid idea forget I said anything.

However it only supports markdown. Thankfully it has a API (unlike substack) and Ive developed a solution that allows you to post any org-mode file you have.
 first make and save this python script I made (and probably put it into your PATH) and make it executable (chmod u+x org-buttondown.py) and install necessary dependencies (python-frontmatter and pandoc)

 I have run across a number laborious text editing operations recently that I thought could be solved elegantly with map and reduce concepts from functional programming. Does something like this already exist or is there a better way than what I am thinking?
 Task 1: 
 I like to write / edit in outline form - one bullet per sentence. A common task is to take a specific paragraph of text and split it by sentence into a bulleted list. 
 Task 2: 
 Conversely, the oposite task is to take a bulleted list at certain indentation level and collapse it back to a paragraph. 
 Task 3: 
 Consider that you want to extract all URLs from a buffer and concatenate them into list (one url per line)

 It occurs to me that the first two tasks could be solved efficiently if there was a flexible ma…</span>

                    <span>Hey Everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs for 2 months now, like it a lot. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. 
 I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. 
 The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. 
 The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.
 It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I&#x27;ve kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. 
 I&#x27;m curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? 
 Thanks, 
 -Hunter

                    <span>I wrote a recursive function that conceptually ought to work even though there&#x27;s no explicit base case. Specifically, successive elements of a finite data structure depend on (what should be) prior elements. 
 It type-checks and compiles, but when I try to run it in GHCI, it hangs for ~10s, throws a *** Exception: stack overflow, and then several seconds later GHCI is killed.
 There are a lot of things that could be undermining my assumptions.
 I understand that debugging these kinds of things is difficult in Haskell (for exactly the reasons good recursion is easy to do); I&#x27;m only on my first day with this problem. Are there normal strategies or tools for homing in on the cause?

                    <span>Using kind-generics /u/Syrak was able to implement a generic implementation of TestEquality which can be used to derive instances for GADTs. It is not commonly known that this is even possible.
 This is what the TestEquality typeclass looks like, witnessing the equality of arguments:
 type TestEquality :: (k -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint class TestEquality f where testEquality :: f a -&gt; f b -&gt; Maybe (a :~: b) 
 By giving a kind-generic instance to Generically1 we are able to derive TestEquality A via Generically1 A, assuming GenericK Wit and GenericK SOrdering instances!

                    <span>Hi there,
 How can I use newtype to wrap a existed data type in haskell? 
 As I read on https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns#evidence, they can wrap sort function to SortedList. They are using newtype and where can they use smart constructors? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I find imenu very helpful for quickly jumping back and forth between defuns in buffers containing lots of function definitions. However, when this command is invoked in an org-mode buffer, the relevant units cease to be defuns and become org headings instead. This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; * Section one
 +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-one () &quot;This is not a useful function.&quot;)
 +end_src
  
Section two
  
+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-two () &quot;This is not a useful function, either.&quot;)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.
 Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I&#x27;m describing? Alternatively, is there a similar command or package that provides this sort of functionality?

                    <span>Good day everyone!
 I&#x27;ve always been using scalamock with scalatest only, but now I&#x27;d like to optimize my tests by rewriting long running sequential scalatest suites to uTest. I&#x27;m using default scalatest MockFactory for my suite. I know that it&#x27;s supposed to work with scalatest only and I&#x27;ve seen in scalamock guide that you can implement your own MockFactoryBase and it should somehow work, but I didn&#x27;t really work for me(maybe I just understood guid wrong). 
 I create separate instance of the mock in every test context
 test(&quot;blah blah&quot;) {val myMock &#x3D; mock[TraitToMock] ...}
 Also my project is written using cats-effect, so I&#x27;m running tests also with it&#x27;s IO 
 And in process I faced multiple issues such as:
 java.util.ConcurrentModificationException: mutation occurred during iteration
 It seems it&#x27;s because in UnorderedHandler(which is used in my tests) handle method they&#x27;re using synchronization, but in parent Handler class operations with handlers are not synchronized.
 https://preview.redd.it/7sflfd9ud0a71.png?width&#x3D;1448&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;8eae336304b348946886066c1214c950229c0b71
 https://preview.redd.it/0nglptufe0a71.png?width&#x3D;1334&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;0db3228a4f760d921e495a122ef8c6350364d995
 Wrapping this methods in synchronization helps and tests don&#x27;t fail. But it seems like this fix is not the best solution.
 If I&#x27;m not getting exception listed above, I get like intersection of mock contexts, mocks handle each other expectations. Something like that
 https://preview.redd.it/8wsgaq0ai0a71.png?width&#x3D;3426&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;16b8b9df369e699b5aac7679518fab8cd3b2cc36
 So maybe someone knows how to make scalamock work with utest properly? Maybe I missed something important or overcomplicate things and much easier solution exists? 
 Thanks in advance!

 Any recruiters that are asking for Scala developers need some experience in Scala. So please help me understand how i can grow in the FP area , so that i can make a move?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am not a full-time developer/coder. But I have been coding for the last ~17 years.
 I have mainly used java. For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.
 Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.
 I don&#x27;t have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.
 Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?
 My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. 
 Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 
 tagging /u/makingthematrix 
 Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.
 ​
 Thanks a tonne

                    <span>The design of a library like linear-base, Tweag’s standard library for Haskell’s
linear types, requires many choices.
One of these choices for linear-base is what a linear Traversable
type class should look like.
One way I use to approach such problems
is to implement instances for the types in GHC.Generics.
GHC.Generics provides a way to implement datatype-generic functions by translating a datatype to and from
a limited set of primitive datatypes representing sums, products, constants, etc.
Therefore, a type class implemented for this set can be given an
instance at a large class of algebraic datatypes.
So this is a nice way to apply structural reasoning to a problem.
The problem
Here is the signature of fmap in linear-base, as it applies, for instance, to lists:

                    <span>Move the Preference setting &quot;Highlight search terms in the editor&quot; to the menu bar. Like the Preference setting &quot;Show image previews in editor.&quot; This will expose it to having a keyboard shortcut. This will make it quick to remove highlighting like this. In this example, I searched for I Need A Frogs Tongue (Don&#x27;t ask.). This is probably a dramatic example, but I daily run into overzealous highlighting, or maybe I should say overzealous searching on my part.
I understand this is meant to be helpful, and sometimes it is. When it is, it is indispensable. When it&#x27;s not, it is an eyesore making it hard to read the zettel.
Will the new MMD editor have this same behavior?</span>

Related to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.
The subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It&#x27;s true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that&#x27;s probably why I chose a paper system.
I also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I&#x27;d like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.
Anyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone&#x27;s expertise! Cheers!</span>

                    <span>I installed which-key today to discover available key bindings. Problem is, if I type C-x, which key shows some bindings in the mini buffer, which often does not fit there, and it shows 1/3 (page 1 of 3). But how do I get to page 2 or 3? If I click on the mini buffer or click on the scroll bar of mini buffer, or type anything else, the mini buffer disappears! What to do?
 Update: After further observation, I noticed two things:
  
I was wrongly using the next page command. I should have been using &#x27;C-h n C-h n&#x27; to get to third page of which-key popup window instead of &#x27;C-h n n&#x27;
 
However, if I use C-h, when the which-key popup window opens up now with available key binding information, it has now two pages, and I cannot use &#x27;C-h n&#x27; to get to the 2nd page. As soon as I type C-h, emacs interprets it as me invoking C-h C-h and reacts accordingly. How do I solve this case?

                    <span>I am using use-package and I am trying to defer the loading of some packages from my init.el. If I understand correctly, this requires that I specify the commands that are to be autoloaded in a :commands block. For some modes, I have found that this is easy and it works. However, for some modes like geiser, I&#x27;ve tried specifying the obvious entry points (e.g. geiser, run-geiser, and geiser-repl) but portions of geiser are still loading and being shown in the features variable. Is there a way to determine what is causing these features to be loaded? I have tried with :defer set both to t and nil with no effect. Perhaps one complication is that geiser already defines some autoload functions (none of which should be called during initialization, I think) and I am not sure how those interact with :commands and :defer.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been recently playing with org-web-tools and Elisp in general. I&#x27;m completely a Elisp noob and that&#x27;s why I hope to get more information here. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to to use org-capture to create a custom template (not for ORG mode). What I&#x27;d like to have is following:
 * [[%site-title|site-url]] 
 I&#x27;ve found this function which will create an ORG link using org-web-tools:
 ;; https://blog.lazkani.io/posts/text-editors/bookmark-with-org-capture/ (defun org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url () &quot;Extend &#x3D;org-web-tools-inster-link-for-url&#x3D; to take URL from clipboard or kill-ring&quot; (interactive) (org-web-tools--org-link-for-url (org-web-tools--get-first-url))) 
 That function I can use in my org-capture templates like this:
  (&quot;b&quot; &quot;Bookmark (Clipboard)&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/work/sync/org/bookmarks.org&quot; &quot;Bookmarks&quot;) &quot;** %(org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:TIMESTAMP: %t\n:END:\n%?&quot; :prepend t) 
 However how can I modify org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url to create a new string like I&#x27;ve mentioned above. The function should return 
 * [[%site-title|s%site-url]] 
 for a given URL in the clipboard. Thanks in advance.

                    <span>In the past previous years, I have tried variety of ways to boost emacs start up time.
  
server + emacsclient
 use-package to defer package loading
 change GC threshold to large value in init.el
 manipulate pdump
 native-comp
  
So far I was able to load most packages without defer in 1s. I was pretty happy.
 Until today, I saw a startup summary function from https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/
 (message &quot;*** Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections.&quot; (format &quot;%.2f seconds&quot; (float-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time))) gcs-done) 
 Then it reports
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.84 seconds with 40 garbage collections. 
 The 40 GCs don&#x27;t quite make sense since I have changed my GC threshold early on in init.el
 Then I tried the following in my early-init.el
 (setq gc-cons-threshold 8000000) ;; ~8MB 
 The number improves to
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.48 seconds with 5 garbage collections. 
 For an example, loading evil changes from
 Loading package evil...done (0.125s) 
 to
 Loading package evil...done (0.064s) 
 Of course, you can further increase GC threshold, but it won&#x27;t make too much impact.
 ​
 So, I finally find a good use case for early-init.el . And here sharing with here. It would be interesting to see if it works for other fellows.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I wanted to share a little package I wrote called preview-org-html-mode. It provides a configurable live preview of an org mode exported to HTML using the xwidget browser in Emacs. I wrote this for personal use but decided to continue to improve my elisp skills.
 Please give it a try if you&#x27;re interested! Still a work-in-progress but it is good enough for my uses. I would also really appreciate any elisp/code suggestions, there are a lot of silly things I think I did in the code but I really don&#x27;t know better and am trying to learn.
 Hope this helps someone, and if not here&#x27;s a fun chance to pick apart some sub-par elisp (please, go for it!)

 And yes, I can see how some people might not find this useful, but I enjoy using it in some special cases I find myself in. Use in good health.

 Literally the first line:
 &quot;slimhtml is now part of Org, included in GNU Emacs, future bug reports or contributions should be sent to Org directly. &quot; 
 First of all I am emacs noob.
 ​
 I cant find it anywhere, its not in org-export-backends, its not in org export dispatch menu.

                    <span>Not sure if this is possible or not, but I vaguely remember having seen it done in a literate config a while ago.
 E.g. I have something like the table below. Would it be possible to run through it to :bind the keybings or something similar?
 | Key name | Operation | |----------------+--------------------------------| | ~M-~ | Move between windows | | ~M-x ~ | Swap buffer between windows | | ~C-~~ | Next window (key above TAB) | | ~C-TAB~ | Cycle through buffers with IVY | | ~C-x k~ | Kill THIS buffer | | ~C-x +~ | Balance the sizes of windows | 
 I&#x27;m quite unfamiliar with org-mode still, so apologies if this is something obvious or if I&#x27;m explaining things poorly.

 This sentence made me interested in scala. 
 I know it is just a series and it is not necessary that it will have a relation with the real world, but, it just makes me curious.
 So, can anyone explain the relevance of the sentence in the real world?

                    <span>In the excitement around Scala 3, I&#x27;m curious to get a sense of what the norms are (or likely to be) for backend web development at your company (for those who use Scala at work). Or simply - what would you recommend?
 From what I&#x27;ve explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.
 How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?
 In a similar vein, what&#x27;s your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).
 I&#x27;m also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I&#x27;ve read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.
 Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?
 My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.
 Warm thanks!

                    <span>Hi All, so i am reading the red book, part 4 about the effects &amp; I/O. So after reading most of the chapters. I think I got an understanding of IO monad, please comment about it to solidify my understanding .
 So an IO Monad provides methods to execute side effects. so i can use those provided methods for sequencing computations, that depend on side effect ( reading data / writing data ) . More like a effects interface / type class.
 ​
 Thank You

                    <span>This is a response to Will&#x27;s Zettel Sharing ... and the interesting interactions which are happening there.
I don&#x27;t have a Zettelkasten, yet (not sure if I ever will have).  I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.
I did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  &quot;What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?&quot;.
I think that I understand, from what I&#x27;ve read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.
The basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; resonates with me.  I&#x27;m just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.  Maybe this already exists (Yahoo groups, Discord, Discourse, Reddit, etc.)?
Just wondering if anyone else has any similar thoughts.</span>

                    <span>Does someone have a solution for tab (not alt-tab) to complete in cc-mode with completion at point functions? I use eglot for completion sources and it correctly sets completion at point functions
 completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in minibuffer.el. Value in # (eglot-completion-at-point t) 
 But c-tab-always-indent doesn&#x27;t respect the same logic as tab-always-ident which when set to &#x27;complete first indents if necessary and then completes via emacs builtin completion at point mechanims, so works fine in, say, emacs lisp mode. Can I get this same &quot;tab indents then completes&quot; functionality in c/cc modes?
 ​
 Thanks for any pointers.

                    <span>Hello, all.
 I am new to emacs and am trying to figure out if it&#x27;s possible to use emacs as a sort of textual interface (e.g. text and ascii graphics) to a graph database. 
 The interface would need to be bidirectional in the sense that I could run certain commands and type certain things into the interface (although be constrained to not be able to type arbitrary text since not all text would correspond to a graph) and have the graph database be updated according to what I had entered, but also, if some external program updated the graph database, the displayed textual representation should be updated as necessary.
 Example:
 The graph has the nodes and edges: A node has an ID which is automatically generated upon its creation, a possibly empty string name, and a possible empty list of la…</span>

                    <span>Hey there,
 Was wondering if the following was possible:
 - If someone had to make a TODO list in Org-Mode, but be able to export the live changes to a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for their boss to review and make related edits within Google Sheets, is this possible?
 I know org-babel and Pandoc exist, and would be able to export things nicely.
 I just didn&#x27;t know if Emacs had any Google Sheet integration with live spreadsheets somehow.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Fellow emacsers. 
 After researching into ergonomic split keyboards and keyboard customizations (I will probably buy a keyboardio model 100), I&#x27;m playing with the idea of trying key chords in emacs, but found not much about it in the wild wild web. 
 In this case key chords means 2 simultaneously pressed keys without modifiers as in https://github.com/emacsorphanage/key-chord.
 Those chords can be mapped to any command, so for example, in Spanish gh is a very uncommon pair. So we could map that to save-buffer, making it faster and easier (in a Dvorak layout) than C-x C-s.
 Does any of you tried it? If you did, what worked for you and what didn&#x27;t? 
 As always, thank you very much for your time, attention and knowledge sharing... :)
 PD: edited to make it clearer what &quot;chording&quot; means in this question. Thanks /u/7890yuiop :)

 If your font supports unicode table symbols, you can have a table (M-x table-insert) with smooth edges.

                    <span>I am an emacs noob, I am following the built-in tutorial and I have a problem with &quot;M-&quot; which is supposed to &quot;Kill the word immediately before the cursor&quot;. When I press &quot;M-&quot; (meaning &quot;Alt-Backspace&quot;), it deletes the next character after the cursor instead. I.e. on my Linux system with emacs 26.3, &quot;M-&quot; does the same thing as &quot;C-d&quot;.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 26.3 in Windows 10 (I work in a Windows intensive environment, and I had to give up the struggle of using Linux). And just this morning, for no reason that I can see, the second command C-f in a command sequence fails to register. 
 For example, I was editing a LaTeX file using AucTeX, which has C-x C-f C-e for entering emphasized text. But the second command key, the C-f, couldn&#x27;t be entered. Emacs stopped at C-x and refused to accept another command key. 
 I closed Emacs down and restarted, and entered C-x C-f to access a file, and again, the C-f wouldn&#x27;t register. It&#x27;s not a problem with my keyboard: the f key works fine (see this post?) and the only changes to my .emacs file have been some minor font changes for font-lock-mode. 
 It seems to involve only C-f. Other sequences do work: C-x C-b for example, or C-x C-s. But C-x C-f is a sequence I use a lot, and I have no idea why it&#x27;s not working. Any ideas? Thanks!

                    <span>The key bindings in Doom Emacs are sometimes unexpected. For example, the undo command in M-x calc is mapped to lowercase u, instead of the usual uppercase U.
 M-x which-key-show-top-levelshows that key binding on page 2 of 8, but I found it accidentally.
 https://preview.redd.it/dcymg45u5i971.jpg?width&#x3D;1405&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;58f4621a3a160971399a8d8424cce76a1f8ab8a6
 Is there a way to / search the top-level key bindings, without having to manually go through all 8 pages (via C-h j)?
 More generally, how can I find the most relevant (&quot;context sensitive&quot;) key bindings? The usual C-h m is not too helpful in Doom Emacs (M-x calc) , as it simply shows the original key binding, followed by &quot;that binding is currently shadowed by another mode&quot;.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a student, and after learning Haskell in a club last year and using it extensively in a side project recently, I feel like it&#x27;s currently the language I&#x27;m most comfortable with. As I prepare to apply for internships for next summer, I&#x27;m wondering if it would be a bad idea to prepare for leetcode-style questions in Haskell.
 Does anyone have experience using it in a &quot;regular&quot; internship interview? (By regular I mean ones where you don&#x27;t expect to use any Haskell in the job.)
 I guess I&#x27;m worried that either the interviewer will just decline to let me use the language, or otherwise let me but still have a negative view of it. In that case I could offer to use a more mainstream language, but I&#x27;d be less practiced in it.
 But I also think using Haskell and it&#x27;s type system helps me tremendously in thinking through difficult problems, so in that way I could see it as an advantage.
 Any advice from either side (interns or interviewers) would be great. Thanks!

                    <span>I am happy to announce the first release of https://hackage.haskell.org/package/typeable-mock
 Its goal is to make mocking functions possible in the context of any monad and with as little boilerplate as possible.
 It is inspired by how easy mocking is in the Python or JS. The mocks are dispatched dynamically by name and type. Only the call site and the test cases are aware of a mock, so the changes are small and never require restructuring of the application for testing.
 I wrote it to make writing tests more enjoyable and I hope you enjoy it too!
 PS: [ANN #2] to record the arguments of the function calls and expecting calls, typeable-mock needs to process the arguments and result of arbitrary functions. The solution turned out to be more general than mocks needed, so I published it as a separate library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/variadic-function

                    <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m trying to obfuscate some data in a dataset to practise Haskell and I&#x27;m running into some difficulties, particularly with regards to memoisation.
 The dataset contains some IP addresses which I want to anonymise by shuffling the last octet (e.g., mapping 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.231) and some email addresses, where I want to tokenise the username (e.g., mapping alice@gmail.com to v38j8a@gmail.com, where v38j8a is just a string generated randomly). Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.
 I&#x27;ve written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I&#x27;m trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I&#x27;m running into difficulty - as I&#x27;m making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I&#x27;m working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -&gt; Int function but not an Int -&gt; IO Int.
 Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn&#x27;t great and it&#x27;s unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; using unsafePerformIO, but I can&#x27;t immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.
 Thanks very much for any help.
 Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs

 (EDIT not just backend-ed by emacs but to have the interaction in emacs)
 Any ideas? Perhaps we need to wait for nyxt to be fully developed..

                    <span>Hey
 I would like to convert some org-mode files to markdown (for easy viewing on Bitbucket), but seems as
 pandoc -o x.md x.org 
 misses some of the org-formatting, eg. images are not included.
 There are many ways to do the things in org-mode, maybe I am just doing it in a &quot;wrong&quot; way. How do you convert from org to md?
 Image example 1:
 #+CAPTION: Image caption #+NAME: fig:image\_name #+ATTR\_HTML: :width 100% #+ATTR\_ORG: :width 100% file:files/my_img.jpg 
 Image example 2:
 [[files/my_img_2.jpg]]

 Update: According to Kattis support, they have a full Scala implementation that is currently disabled due to the performance of Scala programs.

                    <span>(This is a release announcement written as a cautionary tale about the dangers of building your own tools...)
 So I was working through the Roguelike tutorials...
 Field of view in a roguelike
 ...and thought the engine performance could be better - quite normal - every time I build a new type of game I find new ways that Indigo could be better. Tweaked Indigo to change how it deals with large arrays destined for the GPU. While I was there I fixed some other stuff ...and also added the ability to dynamically load shaders. Here are the release notes:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.9.0
 That allowed me to simplify the Roguelike Starterkit and make it faster (if anyone is following along, upgrade!):
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit
 ...but with the new dynamic shader loading I realised I could also solve another problem I&#x27;d been wondering about: How to share live Indigo shader demos?
 Thought it would be fun to have a little website that rendered Indigo flavoured shaders from GitHub gists (no backend, GitHub does the storage, easy peasy...), but website building for me means using Tyrian (an Elm-like web framework), and that also needed an upgrade:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.2.0
 ...but I did eventually build the site:
 https://purplekingdomgames.github.io/shadergist/?gist&#x3D;davesmith00000/5a6b585dbc2184a2c215b16a91234c22
 And thus all the yaks were shaved. Back to game building.

                    <span>Wire Signals is a small event-handling library. It started as a part of the Wire Android codebase. About two thirds of Wire Android is written in Scala, making it unique among Android apps - most of them being implemented in Java and/or Kotlin. Wire is a messenger and as such it must be very responsive: it has to quickly react to any events coming from the backend, as well as from the user, and from the Android OS itself. Most, if not all of the available solutions focus on the backend, so we developed our own implementation of event streams and &quot;signals&quot; - special event streams with caches holding the last propagated value. They proved to be a very flexible and concise way of handling events. During the last we moved that code to a separate repository, rewrote it, added more tests, added …</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone I am a college student taking scala this semester. Our professor has given us a project where he wants us to display the total number of deaths by covid for a specific country using a scala program using scala collections.
 The txt file has records for each country, new cases, new deaths each day, date, total number of deaths etc.
 I&#x27;m struggling to find a way to display the results. I have searched online and found that the basic step would be to something similar to:
 import scala.io.Source
 val lines &#x3D; Source.fromFile(&quot;/Users/Al/.bash_profile&quot;).getLines.toList
 How can I extract specific record from txt file? Any kind of help would be appreciated thankyou

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand why some of the most important people in Typelevel community, are looking down on ZIO ecosystem, and basically ignoring the existence of it, when in fact ZIO introduced inovations that also influenced advance of Cats-Effects. 
 I personaly like both of them, and professionaly I&#x27;m using Typelevel stack, but just can&#x27;t undestand hatred directed to ZIO ecosystem without sane explanation. 
 Is there any reason, besides that ZIO is achieving more and more market share?

 I&#x27;m stuck in here.This works fine on IntelliJ but not on leetcode.
  
Line 8: error: No implicit Ordering defined for List[Int]. (in solution.scala)tarr.map(_.sorted.toList).filter(t &#x3D;&gt; ((t(0) - t(1)).abs &#x3D;&#x3D; min)).sorted

 and I also want to solve like this simple way.
 class Solution: def minimumAbsDifference(self, arr: List[int]) -&gt; List[List[int]]: arr.sort() mn &#x3D; min(b - a for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:])) return [[a, b] for a, b in zip(arr, arr[1:]) if b - a &#x3D;&#x3D; mn] 
 Please give me some advice!

                    <span>I&#x27;m working with akka-stream and would like to define a Flow that takes some data from a Source and writes each record to another system. After all of the records have been written, I need to call a close() method. I&#x27;m running the stream with .runWith(Sink.ignore), and I&#x27;d like to ensure the runWith Future completes only after the close() method has completed.
 So far I&#x27;ve found two ways that seem like they could work with Flows: alsoToMat and watchTermination. In both cases, the runWith Future completes before the close method has completed.
 I&#x27;ve gotten it to work by using .toMat, but this turns the Flow into a Sink. I&#x27;d prefer to keep it as a Flow if possible.
 I wrote this up as an example App on Scastie: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/baWl6EB7TkSjL7DMV2ZX5Q/2
 I appreciate that identifying the last element of a stream is a tricky problem. 
 It seems like there is some precedent for making this kind of thing work. For example, it seems that the FileSource can close a file handle before the full stream has completed. FileSource is implemented as a more complicated custom graph stage. I&#x27;d prefer to avoid that if possible, but I don&#x27;t mind doing it if necessary.

                    <span>Hello! I&#x27;m currently working through a course that posts its material publicly online, and am working through the longest increasing subsequence problem. This problem is a little different than usual because it wants you to return a sequence and not just the length. I feel like I found the length in an efficient way, using dynamic programming. But because I am new to scala and not that great at algorithms, I don&#x27;t think I constructed the subsequence efficiently. Here is my code: 
 /* * Assignment: Longest increasing subsequence * * Sequences are a natural source of computational problems. One such * family of problems involves finding subsequences with specified * properties in a given sequence. This exercise asks you to write * a program that, given a sequence * * s(0), s(1), ..., s(n-1) …</span>

                    <span>I finally got around to finishing this and sticking it on Maven Central, and by finishing it I mean I decided on a whim to start over from scratch a couple days ago and somehow ended up with a better library than I had before. 
 https://github.com/ciaraobrien/dottytags
 It&#x27;s as close as I could get to a straight clone of ScalaTags with the twist that everything is done with macros at compile-time, so it reduces the runtime processing to mostly just concatenating literal strings with a few dynamic strings in an Array with a StringBuilder, with the upshot being that it&#x27;s between 2 and 10 times faster at runtime than ScalaTags (which is already quite quick) depending on the exact nature of the workload it&#x27;s given.

                    <span>Sharing this awesome helper function I came across here: re-builder-query-replace-this 
 when bound to a key in the re-builder window can go straight into regexp query replace (as described in the post). 
 One thing which would make it nicer imo is for the re-builder window to quit after the query replace is done -- currently, after the query replace finishes one is left in the target window with the replacement still highlighted so one has to switch to the re-builder and then quit the re-builder. I tried raising the save-excursion call before selecting the target window but that isn&#x27;t cutting it - anyone know a simple/clean way without hardc-oding buffer names and such?
 for reference, here is the unaltered function def:
  (defun reb-query-replace-this-regxp (replace) &quot;Uses the regexp built with re-builder to query the target buffer. This function must be run from within the re-builder buffer, not the target buffer. Argument REPLACE String used to replace the matched strings in the buffer. Subexpression references can be used (\1, \2, etc).&quot; (interactive &quot;sReplace with: &quot;) (if (eq major-mode &#x27;reb-mode) (let ((reg (reb-read-regexp))) (select-window reb-target-window) (save-excursion (beginning-of-buffer) (query-replace-regexp reg replace))) (message &quot;Not in a re-builder buffer!&quot;)))

                    <span>I am quite happy with Doom and I am moving my old config to it. One thing that bothers me is that when I enable writeroom mode it scales up the font. I want to disable this but I am not sure what&#x27;s the best practice to do it.

                    <span>I saw no configuration variable to do this; but it is a little bit anoying because I use a dark theme and should change it when using latex because snippets are rendered in black.

                    <span>As far as I can tell, there is no pre-defined face for categories in agenda views. Instead the category just uses the same face as the header text, i.e. org-scheduled-today, org-scheduled-previously, etc..
 Is there any way that I could customize the category face in agenda views?
 Category are distinct agenda elements, so it is possible to perhaps create a face for them?
 By the way, I often use org-super-agenda. I don&#x27;t think org-super-agenda can handle this issue, but I am not very familiar with its line formatting capabilties.

                    <span>Since pcre2el got quite some attention lately.
 Has someone played/experimented with emacs-pcre? 
 emacs-pcre uses libpcre, nicely compiles, works and gives the complete Perl Compatible RegEx feature set (as opposed to pcre2el) to emacs.
 Sadly the (user) commands, which would make emacs-pcre convenient are completely missing from the package.
 This is sad, because all the power those missing user commands could give.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve understood continuations for years in the sense that I know they have something to do with control-flow, they form a monad, they&#x27;re very powerful, etc. But I never really had a strong understanding of them in the sense that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to write my own continuation monad without using a reference for all the operations. The sort of thing where I would only really ever use continuations if I&#x27;m using do-notation to package them up. I just didn&#x27;t see how they worked under the hood.
 Recently I was re-reading Wadler&#x27;s comprehending monads, which has a nice section on the continuation monad and how to translate to CPS for both call-by-value and call-by-name. In particular, I was translating his monad comprehensions all the way down to their respective continuations. This lead me to r…</span>

                    <span>Hi, it&#x27;s me again. I&#x27;m now looking for a senior Haskell dev to join my team at Standard Chartered bank, in London.
 My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. For this role we expect hands-on experience with a couple of large Haskell / OCaml projects, and/or managing a team.
 Feel free to reach out to me directly if you&#x27;re interested and have any questions, but applications should go via this link: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100017588
 A more junior role that I advertised before, also in London, is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100012204
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.

                    <span>Hi all!
 I just published (on Hackage) my first ever Haskell library, StrongPath, which provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time than standard FilePath (well, String).
 It is heavily inspired by path library, which we used in Wasp-lang a lot and loved it, but then we wanted even more type safety so I ended up creating StrongPath.
 I still consider myself relatively new to writing production-level Haskell code so I would appreciate more experienced among you taking a look and giving some advice on what could be improved!
 Source code: https://github.com/wasp-lang/strong-path
 Some specific things I would love to get a second thought on:
 1. I ended up with a lot of duplication / boilerplate in the code, repeating same / similar logic …</span>

 I&#x27;m into a research internship based on Haskell for my master&#x27;s degree. Short version: we would like to work on an implementation for a linear type system (https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/linear-types/roadmap). 
 First question: I&#x27;ve been studying Haskell for a few months and I&#x27;m trying to go deep into the GHC. What is the starting point? You have any good resources for a better understanding of what it does?
 Second question: this is the first time that I try to &quot;extend&quot; a compiler. I&#x27;m excited but also a bit scared. What is the &quot;protocol&quot;? There is something that i should know? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 From the description, it seems to be a Haskell library.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I want to share a small library with you. Please go ahead and roast it.
 Its a linked list with size completely determined at compile time.
 It is of limited practicality, but you can do some cool stuff.
  
Compile error when accessing head or tail of empty list.
 
Compile error when .get at index greater than size.
 
You can only zip with list of same size.
 You can split a list, and you get two lists each of which has the correct size.
 Concatenation of lists results in list with correct size.
 
 
cats.Traverse instance
  
Cross compiled for 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to run a small migration program to move my data from You need a budget to GNU cash. I found a program that can do the migration. I can get it to run but I ran into an exception. Which I think is wrong.
 The exception is being thrown against the line below
 D01/08/2017 T-575.00 PInlingua M N CR LMonthly Bills:education 
 It&#x27;s throwing based on the last case. In the file below https://github.com/galbarm/YNAB4toGnuCashMigrationTool/blob/master/src/main/scala/YNABTransaction.scala 
 The case: 
 case _ &#x3D;&gt; assert(L.exists(_.startsWith(&quot;Income:Available&quot;)), s&quot;payee transaction must have an income category: $this&quot;) 
 I&#x27;ve never used scala or java really but is that saying L should start with Income:Available if the payee exists?

                    <span>I understand that Zettels should be about one thought, and that if you create a Zettel about an idea but already have a Zettel about the idea, you should incorporate the details from the new Zettel into the old one.
However, I&#x27;m in doubt about how to best handle in-text citations. E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:
Some description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].

The steps:

1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].
2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].
3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].
4. do b [citekey2].

You do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].

I ask:
If I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?
In general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don&#x27;t question what I do like in the scenario described?
I appreciate your comments in advance.</span>

 I vaguely remember seeing a library which used the YouTube API to convert a playlist/channel and turn it into a set of Org headlines, did I imagine it, if not I guess I&#x27;ll have to write it!

                    <span>Hi guy so recently I learnt about Emacs and wanted to give it a go mostly for fun but also cause I would like to use org-mode to boost my productivity and manage to focus, so as the title says I&#x27;m a non programmer I&#x27;ve written some code in c# but not full time and mostly for curiosity. So far I&#x27;ve downloaded doom Emacs and dabble a bit with it but I cannot even install org-bullets to change the asterisk in org-mode... so yeah i guess that says a lot I hope you guys can point me to the right track thanks in advance

                    <span>As much as I like vim modal editing, I am slowly moving away from using Evil mode. The reason being it makes my emacs so fucking slow.
 Is it me or any one of you guys experience the same? Btw, I am starting to really appreciate emacs keybindings.

 I know that this should be trivial for seasoned Haskell programmers but I have looked at a few folks explanation of the particular recursion that the function has but I am unable to get the concept. Can someone please help?

And I feel like I do not have enough knowledge to base that decision on. Have you done your bachlor&#x27;s at Utrecht University and you master&#x27;s at Charlmers University or the other way around or your PhD? I would love to have a chat. Let me know when you have time, please.
 EDIT: Maybe I should mention why I ask this question here. These are the two EU universities most closely connected to functional programming, static type systems, and Haskell that I could find.

                    <span>I&#x27;m disturbed by the Haskell Foundation accepting sponsorship from IOHK, a company incorporated in Hong Kong.
 The recent suppression of free speech and democratic activism in Hong Kong has been condemned publicly by the leaders of many Western nations, including the USA, UK and Australia. The arrests conducted under this new law seem arbitrarily targeted, and many commentators have described them as being directed by President Xi personally, to suppress dissent.
 However, IOHK is still incorporated in Hong Kong, despite being (to use their own description) &quot;a fully decentralised remote working organisation&quot;. IOHK appears to be well-funded, having (again, from their website) &quot;400+ people across 50+ countries&quot;, and therefore would appear to have had every opportunity to leave Hong Kong, if they did not support the actions of the CCP.
 In the past, people on this subreddit have loudly and forcefully condemned US-based companies like Facebook, and US defense contractors, for their use of Haskell, and have stated they would not work for those companies.
 Is anyone else equally disturbed by this funding arrangement for the Haskell Foundation? At what point would it become disturbing to accept money from a remote company that is happily headquartered in an authoritarian regime?

                    <span>Hello, I apologize for a rather long post.
 I&#x27;m trying to improve my haskell understanding and was attempting re write of go code that I did few weeks ago. my current best implementation is taking about 500% of go code, and I&#x27;m looking for ways to improve wall clock time for haskell script.
 task is to parse 2 text files, and comparing their content. format of files is
 DOCID_{num}\t{num}\t{num0},{f0} {num1},{f1} ..... {numN},{fN}\n 
 It&#x27;s mainly a repost of https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/263682/parsing-custom-text-file-using-haskell/263731#263731 , where I&#x27;m trying to get haskell code wall clock time as close to golang as possible
 Edit1: Adding algorithm for the code for completeness .
 to perform this comparison efficiently I have sorted both input files based on numeric…</span>

                    <span>Hey everybody, after having built some web applications with Scala/Scala.js, we started stripping common functionality out into a reusable template.
 While this is similar to bootzooka, the main difference is the tech stack.
 For anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried building web apps in Scala.js, let me tell you that it is a lovely experience, having worked with several JavaScript frameworks before, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Scala.js + Slinky (React) + Scalablytyped.
 There is still lots of stuff to do but if we focus on getting it perfect, we wouldn&#x27;t get to a release date ever.

                    <span>Greeetings from a newbie.
Today, I see the Devonthink for Historians Youtube channel posted some thoughts about keeping a Zettelkasten.
Being new to the way of the Zettel, I don&#x27;t know if their ideas match well with the Zettelkasten community.
It was interesting to hear them talk about &quot;evolutionary sifting,&quot; which I think is probably similar to the Zettelkasten Boy Scout rule, leaving notes better than you found them.
Anyway, if it&#x27;s of interest -  .</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t like that I have to choose between using the easy to use minor modes like &#x60;display-battery-mode&#x60; and &#x60;lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable&#x60; versus setting &#x60;modeline-format&#x60;. I still want the info from lsp-modeline for example, I just want to tweak the spacing and such of the modeline.
 Is there a way to mess with the modeline without resorting to modeline-format, or is there a way to get the info that lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable adds to the modeline so I can create a custom one without reinventing all these nice modeline modes?

                    <span>My file has a sequence of 1000 numbers, generated in Emacs Evil mode via:
 :r!seq 1000
 I want to keep all numbers with consecutive digits of either 2 or 3 (e.g., 22, 23, 32, 33, 122, 123, 132).
 M-x keep-lines RET [23]\{2\}
 The above works fine, but the following does not work:
 M-: (keep-lines &quot;[23]\{2\}&quot;)
 What is the correct syntax for the latter approach (M-:)? Appreciate a link to the documentation.

                    <span>Hey, did anyone try gtk-3 branch on windows? Does it work? Are there any benefits? I&#x27;m mainly interested if thre are any improvements in hidpi handling since gtk-3 rewrite handles hidpi on Linux pretty well. Also, if there is a decent documantation of how to build it on windows I&#x27;d be thankful for them

                    <span>I am using Cygwin on Windows for Emacs and I am unable to get MELPA to work. I am not sure if I am missing a package that needs to be installed and if so which ones but here is my .emacs file:
 ​
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) ;; Comment/uncomment this line to enable MELPA Stable if desired. See &#x60;package-archive-priorities&#x60; ;; and &#x60;package-pinned-packages&#x60;. Most users will not need or want to do this. ;;(add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) 
 ​
 When I try : 
 M-x package-refresh-contents 
 I get the following:
 Error while verifying signature archive-contents.sig: Command output: gpg: keyblock resource &#x27;/home/jogre/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: can&#x27;t open &#x27;/tmp/epg-signatureQXh3st&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: verify signatures failed: No such file or directory

                    <span>I started using emacs like about 2 weeks, I did enjoy the experience in emacs especially the org-mode. I have some questions regarding some packages that are available for Emacs form the repositories. Since I was familiar with the keyboard navigation style in neovim, I used the package named Evil in Emacs to get vi like naviagtion but, My tab key seems to not respond in the org-mode. I wanted it to give me tabspaces but the cursor is being lazy and standing still. My configuration file that I have written so far is shared here. Emacs experts please help me and point me in right directions. Thanks.

 How could get Emacs-Keybindings there?

 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for Unicode text. Now you can print Unicode text using TrueType fonts.
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>Hi all, started using Emacs yesterday to write down study notes and managed to activate math symbols preview in the buffer with Mx set-input-method TeX.
 Now I want to specify it in the org file so I don&#x27;t have to type out the command each time I open Emacs, how can it be done? I googled it to no avail, some anwers show a piece of lisp code but I have no idea where to put it and the manual page I&#x27;ve found is not too clear as well.
 I&#x27;m using vanilla Emacs with no customizations.

                    <span>Hello,I&#x27;m switching from vim to emacs. 
 I also want to use native emacs key bindings rather than evil , but
 Emacs tutorial , hasn&#x27;t much ergonomics methods compared to vimtutor .
 I&#x27;m sure, emacs tutorial hiding their methods,
 all I can see in Emacs tutorial is just basic forward , backward , search, nothing detailed ergonomics . 
 Would i know more ?

                    <span>As a speed test, I generated a file with a sequence of 10000 numbers in command line:
 seq 10000 &gt; seq.txt
 I want to keep only numbers with the digits 2, 4, and 6. 
 Using VIM, the following command completes in less than a second:
 :v/^[246]*$/d
 However, when using Emacs Evil mode, it takes more than a minute of my CPU time! Why is it so much slower? Is there an equivalent eLisp command that would be faster? Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got this code from Chapter 39 of Get Programming with Haskell
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BC import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as LC import Network.HTTP.Simple myToken :: BC.ByteString myToken &#x3D; &quot;RXQqorkfHCNzzgJjtYcZXKfdgrpYtkfB&quot; noaaHost :: BC.ByteString noaaHost &#x3D; &quot;www.ncdc.noaa.gov&quot; apiPath :: BC.ByteString apiPath &#x3D; &quot;/cdo-web/api/v2/datasets&quot; response &#x3D; httpLBS &quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot; 
 then this works
 getResponseStatusCode  response 
 giving back 200 just fine. This also seems to go in fine
 buildRequest :: BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; Request buildRequest token host method path &#x3D; setRequestMethod method $ setRequestHost host $ setRequestHeader &quot;token&quot; [token] $ setRequestPath path $ setRequestSecure True $ setRequestPort 443 $ defaultRequest request :: Request request &#x3D; buildRequest myToken noaaHost &quot;GET&quot; apiPath 
 but this is a build and run project with this finally
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do response &lt;- httpLBS request let status &#x3D; getResponseStatusCode response if status &#x3D;&#x3D; 200 then do print &quot;saving request to file&quot; let jsonBody &#x3D; getResponseBody response L.writeFile &quot;data.json&quot; jsonBody else print &quot;request failed with error&quot; 
 Question: Can this final section be repackaged/redone to also work at the REPL? (Using :{ ... :} of course.)

 508kB It&#x27;s what I got with it gziped. Didn&#x27;t find the recommended way to uglify it.
 Maybe I did something wrong? What is the size it should be? (of the js boundle I mean)

                    <span>Building a web-app backend in Scala, I&#x27;m looking for a normal/standard library/framework stack that a typical scala dev would use on a simple backend project that supports the following: HTTP server/API, sql database connection, authentication.
 Coming from the JavaScript world, this stack might be Express (server) + Sequelize (db ORM) + Passport.js (authentication).
 Hoping you all can help cut through the noise and point me in the right direction here :).
 Thank you.

So I have two questions:

                    <span>I am in the process of switching from qwerty to colemak through the tarmak layouts. 
 Have you ever switched layout in Emacs? Did you temporarily remap your core bindings (I mean, you don&#x27;t want to hit C-k by accident when you think you&#x27;re hitting C-n, right?) Or did you go straight to the new bindings? What are pros and cons of these approaches? Looking forward to hear your stories and your opinion

                    <span>Another post about how you can mold data to tell a story!
 In this case we want to check that unit tests remain speedy for a Clojure project. It works also for Scala (and Java I think, not tested). Some tweaking needed for other languages that can export test results to XML reports following JUnit reports.

                    <span>I am in the process of learning Haskell and I just had an epiphany but I want to make sure I haven&#x27;t quite gone off the deep end yet.
 To compare it to C#, a Monad is what an Interface is to a Class in C#, but with all inherited behavior fully defined in the Interface.
 The four Monad operations that I am aware of in Haskell, &gt;&gt;&#x3D;, &gt;&gt;, return and fail, are used to programatically add and change an Interface onto a set of data, or Class in C#.
 This allows a clean set of data to have any interface attached to it and have whatever predefined behavior performed on that data.
 Let me know if I am about right or pretty far off!

 Okay, recursion is so much more concise...
 reverseList list &#x3D; if length list &lt; 2 then list else last list : reverseList (init list)

                    <span>Hello, I just started learning Haskell few weeks ago and first worked through the LYAH and now go through the recommended wikibook from the official Haskell site and solve along the 99 problems and some codewars (I hope this is a good approach right now). 
 To learn to build something more real world and less synthetic, I decided to create a small web app where users can rate and comment on courses from my university and then went looking for an appropriate framework. In the official wiki I found https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ which looks like an incredible piece of software engineering and I immediately watched their 25 minute video of demonstration and quite fell in love with it. BUT I am worried that using this would take away a lot of classical Haskell, because to me it seems a lot like Django or similar frameworks. With their different custom syntax operators like |&gt; I feel like I’d be more learning their framework than actually Haskell. Is that a legitimate concern? My main goal is not to build a wonderful web app that makes me $$$ but just to build something with Haskell that is useful and that I can extend over time. 
 Would a more lightweight framework be more appropriate and if so which? Is my impression of it not being really haskelly wrong? It feels like a lot of what makes haskell awesome has been abstracted away for ease of usage which is great for production but probably not for learning. 
 I hope my question is clear and you can understand my concern. Thanks for any input.

                    <span>I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.
 Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can&#x27;t say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.
 Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don&#x27;t understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it. Maybe I &quot;solved&quot; a side-effect of another problem instead?
 Can anybody give me a bit of insight that will either give me confidence in my solution or help me find the real problem?

                    <span>On my home network I have two computers, both running Windows 10.
 On the desktop computer, I&#x27;ve got VcXsrv and WSL1 running, and I have the Linux build of Gnu Emacs 27.1 running under WSL and displaying through X Windows.
 On the laptop computer, I&#x27;ve got VcXsrv running.
 On the emacs on the desktop, I run M-x make-frame-on-display to pop up a frame on the laptop. This way, I have only one instance of emacs running, and I can view and edit the same buffers from both computers without worry of getting my files out of sync. (I tend to pace my apartment while I work, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to access my buffers from two different rooms.)
 Unfortunately, when the laptop goes to sleep, the emacs on the desktop computer freezes for a few seconds and then crashes.
 What would you suggest as a workaround or fix?
 (Please don&#x27;t suggest &quot;delete the frame on the laptop before putting the laptop to sleep&quot;. Yes that would presumably work but I won&#x27;t remember to do that.)

                    <span>i&#x27;m using a spreadsheet in org mode and am trying to figure out how many occurrences i have of a string, specifically &quot;sfp28-10glr-31 intel&quot;. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that does this in my searches and was hoping you might be able to shed some light. 
 thanks much for your help
 the table structure looks like this
 | sfp28-10glr-31 intel, sfp28-10glr-31 cisco, 3m fiber cable | sfp28-10glr-31 intel, sfp28-10glr-31 cisco, 3m fiber cable |

                    <span>I finally figured out how to set up lsp-mode within Doom emacs and I&#x27;m having more fun editing code with emacs than ever before. One question I had though is that when there&#x27;s a &#x27;fix available&#x27; (currently editing c++ code) and it tells me the fix to perform, what&#x27;s the command/shortcut for doing such fix? Apologies for the stupid question I&#x27;ve been using emacs for a few months now and have always just worked with my own (pretty poor) config and am just now realizing what lsp is and why it&#x27;s useful lol.

                    <span>I have (setq gnus-gcc-externalize-attachments &#x27;all) in my configuration, in order not to save sent attachments on disk in my Gcc group. Unfortunately, Gnus has been ignoring this setting (or at least it does not work anymore) since I upgraded from Emacs 26 to Emacs 27.2 with Gnus 5.13.
 Is anybody else having this problem or knows what might be going on?

                    <span>Version: Emacs 26.3 on Debian/Ubuntu 
 Is there a way to use env variables in a link in orgmode?
 So I put a variable NEXT in my /etc/environment file and (getenv &quot;NEXT&quot;) in my init.el file and so far it works. When I want to open a new file, I can use $NEXT in my path, which is nice.
 But sometimes I want to use links with $NEXT instead of \very\long\path\to\Nextcloud in them and that seems to not really work. 
 Is there a way to make this work?

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting this generated heading when I run org-hugo-export-to-md
 ## Heading {#heading} 
 What I really want is just
 ## Heading 
 After reading the docs, I thought that the https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/usage/#org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading is responsible for setting this behaviour. But when I look through counsel-describe-variable, this variable doesn&#x27;t show up in the list.
 Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried setting the variable via these two methods:
 Setting it in my config.el
 (use-package ox-hugo :ensure t :after ox :custom (org-hugo-base-dir &quot;.&quot;) (org-hugo-front-matter-format &quot;yaml&quot;) (org-hugo-section &quot;braindump&quot;) (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading &quot;&quot;)) 
 Setting it in .dir-locals.el
 ((nil . ((org-hugo-base-dir . &quot;.&quot;) (org-hugo-front-matter-format . &quot;yaml&quot;) (org-hugo-section . &quot;braindump&quot;) (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading &quot;&quot;))) 
 But no luck.
 I&#x27;ve posted this issue in the ox-hugo github here https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/449 but I figured maybe I can get a quicker response here since I think the issue is coming from my config not the package.
 EDIT:
 The author of the library replied in the GitHub issue. There is a way to disable it. But it doesn&#x27;t help me in my overall goal. Thanks for reading.

                    <span>I got EXWM set up last night using example configs that I perused on GitHub. I got counsel-linux-app and dmenu going with global keybindings so I have basic functionality for my workflow good to go. 
 I appreciate the developers and community here. I am pleased with the wide practicality of Emacs. And I have a new hobby of Emacs tinkering. :-)
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi, currently learning Haskell and pretty much everywhere I look I am told that one should avoid explicit recursion and try and use functional abstractions like fold or map.
 This has caused me some pain when, as an exercise, I was implementing the library function dropWhile. My initial implementation using explicit recursion looked like this:
 dropWhile :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] dropWhile _ [] &#x3D; [] dropWhile p xs@(x:xs&#x27;) | p x &#x3D; dropWhile&#x27; p xs&#x27; | otherwise &#x3D; xs 
 This also seems to match the implementation used in the GHC source code.
 After some perusing I found an example using foldr as follows:
 dropWhile :: (a -&gt; Bool )-&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] dropWhile p &#x3D; fst . foldr f ([], []) where f x ~(xs,ys) &#x3D; (if p x then xs else x:ys, x:ys) 
 After some head wracking I do understand the second definition. However I would like to know if this is a situation in which the implementation using explicit recursion is preferable as it is easier to reason about?

                    <span>I am trying (with the blessing of the cabal maintainers and the haskell foundation) to spearhead an initiative to re-vamp the cabal documentation. Right now it is a combination of reference material, and a user guide. It would be nice to have a beginner friendly, linear guide that walks a newcomer through the most common use cases of cabal.
 I am trying to keep on top of the issue tracker and provide plenty of context. The first three sections have all their required chapters recorded in the issue tracker https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/issues
 I plan on adding the more advanced chapters as issues later, but if anyone feels especially strongly about contributing those it would be greatly appreciated. They can be found in the SUMMARY.md https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md
 I want this project to be friendly to beginner contributors, so if you want to take an issue and learn as you write it, I would love that and will be happy to offer any guidance I can (as well as coercing more senior cabal contributors to offer input).
 Thanks everyone, I think this is a really important initiative to improve the haskell ecosystem for the uninitiated and the old guard alike!

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m seeing weird behavior with this implementation of open tracing as it&#x27;s not producing fully isolated spans (some spans are combining together). My theory is that this is from the context switching between threads in the ExecutionContext but would really appreciate any nudges in the right direction. 
 Below is the code I&#x27;ve written so far https://scastie.scala-lang.org/DZCCyl8WRoOBgeragoDbXQ

                    <span>Is there a way to examine the LLVM IR generated by scala native?
 I ran the sample template project listed here - https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/sbt.html#minimal-sbt-project and got a bunch of ll files - 0.ll, 1.ll, 2.ll, etc each of which seems to contain obfuscated LLVM IR. Is it meant to look like this and be unreadable?
 I can see that there is a Main.NIR file (as expected). Do I need to convert the NIR to LLVM IR in some way?

 http4s - 7 years
 http4k - 1 year
 
 Website 
 http4s - bare bone
 http4k - looks like a microsite, but still provides some confidence.
 
 Features and integrations 
 http4s - bare bone. Almost 0 integrations.
 http4k - well equiped with provided modules for telemetry, resilience, oauth, aws, chaos engineering, cloud native support etc.
 
 Documentation 
 http4s - Incomplete to the point of missing a lot of FAQ type use cases.
 http4k - Well rounded documentation covering most common and upcoming use cases like resilience, rpc, graphql, telemetry.
 
 Prerequisites 
 http4s - Decent understanding of Cats, fs2, Free&#x27;s is a must.
 http4k - Well... read the documentation.
 
  
And this is when we compare http4s which is quite mature scala project to a new project like http4k. So... why ?

                    <span>This post describes how to use OBazl to
build OCaml projects with Bazel.
Compared to the first OCaml ruleset published in
2016, which contains only a few basic rules, OBazl is under active development
and aims to provide highly granular, low-level control over the build, and
eventually automatically generate build files.
It is therefore a practical choice to enjoy Bazel’s incremental, parallel,
cacheable and remote building capacities.
However, it is in its early stages, requiring manual work for some tasks that
will be automated in the future.
To exemplify its usage, I will show how to convert the build of the
uri package to Bazel. Since OCaml and
Bazel is not a frequent combination, I will give an introduction to Bazel, as
well as some aspects of compiling OCaml modules.

                    <span>I know that using M-x setenv I can set LYNX_LSS to /etc/lynx.lss.
 What I can&#x27;t figure out is how to set that in ~/.emacs.d/init.el so I don&#x27;t have to go thru that every time
 I start emacs. I don&#x27;t know lisp so I&#x27;ve tried copying and editing a few examples I found on the net:
 http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_env_var_paths.html
 but nothing seems to work.
 I would appreciate any help.
 Thanks

                    <span>i believe there&#x27;s builtin help documentation on keymaps (in evil mode). i&#x27;ve scoured the internet to find information about especially the  leader combinations. i&#x27;ve become a fan of this leader key shortcuts. but the thing is i cant find documentation that covers it.
 i&#x27;ve tried  h f &quot;map!&quot; ; but that spits out elisp! what&#x27;s the command to discover these bindings?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup emacs for develop using Dart. I&#x27;ve already installed Flutter &amp; Dart on my system, so I&#x27;m trying to setup lsp-dart.
 This is my init.el file:
 ;; Install use-package (condition-case nil (require &#x27;use-package) (file-error (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;use-package) (require &#x27;use-package))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t) (use-package lsp-dart :ensure t :hook (dart-mode . lsp)) ;; Optional packages (use-package projectile :ensure t) ;; project management (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (yas-global-mode)) ;; snippets (use-package lsp-ui :ensure t) ;; UI for LSP (use-package company :ensure t) ;; Auto-complete ;; Optional Flutter packages (use-package hover :ensure t) ;; run app from desktop without emulator 
 which I copy-pasted from the emacs-lsp&#x27;s github page.
 The problem is that I retrieve this error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-dart: Package ‘lsp-dart-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Failed to install projectile: Package ‘projectile-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Cannot load projectile 
 and I cannot figure how to resolve it. 
 I&#x27;ve tried to install projectile using M-x package-install RET projectile RET (after enabling MELPA), but I get an error saying that projectile-2.3.0 cannot be found, while the MELPA website says that the projectile current version is 2.4.0.
 ​
 What am I missing?

 (I&#x27;m not English, so sorry for eventual errors)

                    <span>Sorry if this is a dumb question! How can I edit lines in a *xref* buffer containing grep results? I&#x27;m looking for something like pressing &quot;e&quot; in Occur buffer.
 There is a key binding &quot;r&quot;, but I find it only applies to the search text instead of the entire line. Am I missing something?

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to hear about the layouts you&#x27;ve selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.
 Background, for normal, sane people who don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about:
 One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.
 These keyboards make heavy use of &#x27;layers&#x27; - additional custom &#x27;modifier&#x27; keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..
 For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as &quot;home row modifiers&quot;. Typically you&#x27;d make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.
 But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I&#x27;m interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they&#x27;ve settled on.
 I&#x27;m playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a &#x27;game&#x27; in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I&#x27;m thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.

                    <span>This is a thread for smaller, miscellaneous items that might not warrant a full post. 
 Don&#x27;t feel constrained in regards to what you post, just keep your post vaguely, generally on the topic of emacs.

                    <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m asking the impossible:
 Does anyone have any Emacs configs that would make Emacs so easy to use, that normal people like my partner would be able to utilize it for their daily TODO lists?
 I&#x27;m talking GUI friendly options, sane normal people keyboard shortcut choices, and even the ability to totally ignore normal Emacs regular keybindings.
 I ask because I was showing off what Org Mode could do, but was told that it looked too complicated to use.
 Does anyone have any links to some super-easy-to-use user-friendly Emacs configs that would be mouse and GUI based? (I know, its sacrilege but hey, gotta try somehow).
 I know Emacs without a config has the context menu which is fine, but yeah, looking for some tips in this department. This person was debating using it for TODO lists for work, and also maybe for writing scripts for TV shows, etc.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hey guys. It looks like OpenAI is collaborating with GitHub on their GPT stuff, so any assistance in building an editor in emacs would be greatly appreciated. I made a start 4 months ago, link below:
  
https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/
 https://copilot.github.com/
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;27676266
  
I am looking for some help bundling this up as an emacs package and ongoing work on connecting GPT-j (and others) to various emacs libraries.
 I personally believe GPT-3+vscode is an emacs killer. That is not the view of everybody here. But I believe emacs is a much better platform for building this stuff, so please help! Thanks.

                    <span>I was playing around with fancy record libaries and was very impressed with how well labels can infer types. Probably because it avoids unnecessary complexity and less-frequently-used operations.
 So I wanted to try how much unnecessary complexity and infrequently operations I could throw on top of it while maintaining reasonable type inference. Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.
 union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: (&quot;foo&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bi&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bar&quot; :&#x3D; Int, &quot;baz&quot; :&#x3D; Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: (&quot;foo&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bi&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bar&quot; :&#x3D; Int, &quot;baz&quot; :&#x3D; Double) 
 The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:
 type family Concat l r where Concat &#x27;[] a &#x3D; a Concat (x &#x27;: xs) a &#x3D; x &#x27;: Concat xs a 
 I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:
 l :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2] l &#x3D; Proxy r :: Proxy &#x27;[3,4] r &#x3D; Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c &#x3D;&gt; Proxy a -&gt; Proxy b -&gt; Proxy c cat _ _ &#x3D; Proxy c1 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] c1 &#x3D; cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy &#x27;[3,4] c2 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] c2 &#x3D; cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2] c3 &#x3D; cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] 
 And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1
 You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks. Does anyone know of a cleaner/less silly solution?

                    <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working through Types and Programming Languages by Pierce lately and really enjoying it. Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it&#x27;s variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). 
 I&#x27;m interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to &quot;desugar&quot; syntax into it&#x27;s core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I&#x27;ve considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. However I can see it&#x27;s been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.
 Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I&#x27;m interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it&#x27;s interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.
 I&#x27;m aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.
 Cheers

                    <span>I&#x27;m starting a small actor oriented project in Typed Akka and was thinking of possibly using this as an excuse to update my knowledge by doing the project in Scala 3. I noticed that the official quick start giter8 template akka/akka-quickstart-scala.g8 uses Scala version 2.13.1 
 I have attempted to add Akka dependencies to the Scala 3 template scala/scala3.g8 and also attempted to change the Scala version number in the Akka template but both result in unresolved dependencies and failed to build.
 Is there a way to get Scala 3 and Typed Akka up and running with current versions (I saw an older unofficial template from 2019 using Dotty but nothing more recent)?
 If I must I can postpone using Scala 3 to a later project. It is more vital that this use Akka than that it use Scala 3.

                    <span>I am developing an MVP for a SaaS product as a progressive web app hosted on Firebase at the request of a VC. As I get started I am reminded why I f**king hate TypeScript/JavaScript so much. I&#x27;d say between not being that good at FE to begin with and having to manage dumb error messages I am losing velocity. I&#x27;d love to develop this in Scala.JS and Laminar as it’s so much simpler and I already know Scala fairly well, but I am worried that if when the MVP needs to scale and onboard new developers I will have trouble finding any. Should I just suck it up and use React? Part of me feels like I am putting the cart in front of the horse worrying about what will happen if this product will get funding when it hasn&#x27;t yet.

                    <span>I&#x27;m playing around with readability when reading large blocks of text in emacs, and sometimes the lines kind of blur together for me when I&#x27;m reading. I think coloring each sentence a different color would help me keep track of my place without needing to actively highlight each line. As far as I can tell, the only way to do this is with some implementation of faces. However, it looks like each face is assigned to a single color, so I would have to figure out how to switch to a different face for each sentence in a paragraph. The fact that I&#x27;m doing all of this within org-mode kinda complicates things too, since I only want this to apply to paragraphs, not other elements.
 Has anyone else attempted to do anything similar to this? Is there a better way to approach this?

                    <span>Hey, I started today to create my emacs config. I&#x27;m following the Emacs from scratch series from System Crafters in youtube. 
 I want to have the same mappings I have on Neovim. I&#x27;m using general.el and my leader key is the spacebar. And I want to map spacebar to do fuzzy search, so by just pressing double spacebar I&#x27;m searching for a file (similar to doom-emacs amd what I have on my neovim config). 
 Can&#x27;t figure what is the syntax for mapping the spacebar. For setting the leader key, using SPC worked, but doesn&#x27;t work for mapping spacebar after the prefix. 
 Here&#x27;s how I have defined my leader key.
 (use-package general :config (general-evil-setup t) (general-create-definer rune/leader-keys :global-prefix &quot;SPC&quot;)) 
 And here are the mappings I have:
 (rune/leader-keys &#x27;normal &quot;b&quot; &#x27;(:ignore b :which-key &quot;buffers&quot;) &quot;bb&quot; &#x27;(counsel-switch-buffer :which-key &quot;all buffers&quot;) &quot;bs&quot; &#x27;(save-buffer :which-key &quot;save buffer&quot;) &quot;bq&quot; &#x27;(kill-current-buffer :which-key &quot;quit buffer&quot;) &quot;/&quot; &#x27;(swiper :which-key &quot;search in buffer&quot;)) 
 What I have tried:
 &quot;SPC&quot; &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) &quot;&quot; &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) 
 That last one I tried:
 (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) 
 Those don&#x27;t work, can anyone point me in the right direction ? Thanks.

                    <span>Does anyone know how to make the side scrolling wheel scroll left/right? To be specific, I have the Logitech MX 3 mouse which has both a scroll wheel for vertical and horizontal scrolling. While I know that learning the keybindings is a good idea (don&#x27;t worry I already know them), it is nice to actually have the mouse work in the one would it expect it should. I did check out Xah&#x27;s blog on mouse configuration, but he doesn&#x27;t mention this. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Greetings Emacslings,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to get company-mode to only trigger completion on tab. This is my set up, which does pretty much what I want:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package company :defer t :diminish &quot;&quot; :hook ((prog-mode) . (lambda () (company-mode))) :config (setq tab-always-indent &#x27;complete) (setq company-idle-delay nil) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3) :bind (:map company-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . &#x27;company-indent-or-complete-common) :map company-active-map (&quot;C-n&quot; . &#x27;company-select-next-or-abort) (&quot;C-j&quot; . &#x27;company-select-next-or-abort) (&quot;C-p&quot; . &#x27;company-select-previous-or-abort) (&quot;C-k&quot; . &#x27;company-select-previous-or-abort)))
 (use-package company-prescient :defer t :hook (company-mode . company-prescient-mode)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The only problem now is that yasnippets are borked up: tab triggers company, which doesn&#x27;t test to see if it can expand as yasnippet first. Is there any way for me to get this working how I&#x27;d like?
 Edit: better minimal example

                    <span>I am following this post Suggest me a good Emacs Color Theme for Latex text editing. I basically want a color light latex color theme to edit LaTeX text. Basically, I am working in a very bright environment and dark themes make it quite difficult to see anything. However, in light themes, all of the equations are a faint light color that blend in too much with the light background (I am using the gui mode)
 I am looking for something that is
  
Light theme: something that looks good on gui mode
 Code in math mode is dark, contrasting the light background
  
Thank you for your time.

                    <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a long time but my needs are not that fancy so my understanding of it is not that great. I&#x27;m mostly using it to edit DNS (bind) and configuration files. 
 I have for a long time had this peculiar thing come up. In most of my dns zone files the TAB key acts as I want, ie when you press TAB the cursor moves 8 characters to the right, (from position 1) when you move the marker with arrow left it jumps back to position 1, and if you press TAB again it jumps 8 characters to the right again.
 But in some files when I press TAB the marker moves to something like position 16. Now when you press arrow left the marker goes to the left as if the space is filled with spaces. If you try to press TAB again nothing happens.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to read the documentation on how to program the TAB key but I haven&#x27;t been able to solve the problem.

                    <span>I would like LSP mode to be enabled in the special &quot;org src buffer&quot; it creates when you press C-c &#x27; on a source block. I know about lsp-org but that seems to only work with editing inside the actual org file and it seems wonky at best (flycheck detecting things outside source block). This is for python with lsp-pyright. I&#x27;m also wondering if the special org src buffer has a hook on closing or something. I want to run my python black command when I close the src buffer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working like it does in my normal files. This the package I&#x27;m using: https://github.com/pythonic-emacs/blacken

                    <span>Hi, is there a package that displays the distance number from the cursor position above every character of the current line? It would be useful because it would be possible to move the cursor exactly in the position of a specific character using a evil-mode shortcut, pressing a number and h/l to move right or left a specific number of times. I have yet the distance from current line for every line, using linum, but i think that even this feature would be useful.

                    <span>I get the following stack backtrace when using Emacs for windows built as such. 
 Digging deeper, this is the lisp form that is causing problems:
  (desktop-create-buffer 208 &quot;c:/Users/thequ/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.el&quot; &quot;.emacs.el&quot; &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode &#x27;(eldoc-mode override-global-mode global-auto-revert-mode flx-ido-mode dired-omit-mode auto-complete-mode) 35 &#x27;(1 nil) nil nil &#x27;((buffer-display-time 24790 5102 984406 0) (buffer-file-coding-system . undecided-dos)) &#x27;((mark-ring (36)))) 
 and it is the dired-omit-mode part of this lisp form that is barfing. 
 I think I will remove this form from the desktop records to get it to work. But if you could explain why this happened and how to fix it, I would appreciate it.

                    <span>Underscores and dashes are treated as word breaks so when I use the evil commands like dw to delete a word such as abc-abc-abc I have type 5cw instead of just cw.
 Can this setting be configured?
 I don&#x27;t mind some code which can change the configuration on the fly, perhaps I can use Cw for cases when I want to see dashes as regular letters of a word and use cw for the standard usage.

                    <span>I just installed and configured “vanilla” Emacs today with standard Emacs keybindings as they remind me of my old Wordstar and Word Perfect days on MS-DOS. I’m not a coder or programmer. I write and edit legal documents for a living. I have installed a dark theme and some add-ons.
 I’ve started using it for its text editing capabilities, but I am impressed with its extensible features as well. It has now become my go-to for most html browsing and I also browse Gemini capsules and Gopher holes with it. I really like the file manager, built-in terminal (I use a lot of tui apps out of preference), multimedia and internet radio support, org-mode which I am using to write unit meeting agendas, as well as the built in games.
 I’m looking for suggestions for additional extensions that work with my use case as I would like to use Emacs for the majority of my workflow rather than rely on multiple tui and GUI applications. Additional game recommendations would be welcome as well.
 Emacs seems like an another OS within my OS (I use Fedora at home and when I telework).
 Initially I thought that Emacs would be “too hard and complicated” but I have enjoyed the tutorial and documentation. I feel like I am just scratching the surface.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to write a small GHC extension to get my hands on GHC hacking. As suggested by the GHC gitlab wiki, I started off by having a look at this article by SPJ and SM to get a feel for GHC&#x27;s architecture.
 I now have an idea for what I think would be a relatively small GHC extension that I would like to have a crack at as a first attempt at actually modifying GHC&#x27;s source code: CoercibleStrings. The outcome would be similar in spirit to that of the existing OverloadedStrings GHC extension, however, the latter I believe &quot;only&quot; infers the type (Data.String.IsString a) &#x3D;&gt; a for a string literal l during type checking and then desugars them to fromString l, where fromString :: (Data.String.IsString a) &#x3D;&gt; String -&gt; a is from the typeclass Data.String.IsString.

                    <span>I am interested on the state of Haskell (server side and back-end more specifically). I have seen some git repos that provide some bindings in C in order to execute Haskell on Swift. 
 Is it possible to have Haskell on the Backend and Swift on the frontend? Are the efforts not worth it?

                    <span>Hi all ... I&#x27;ve been playing with Haskell on Ubuntu (20.04, Focal), having recently installed it with the command &quot;sudo apt-get install haskell-platform&quot;. ghci seems to work fine, but anything I try compiling with ghc gives a linker error.
 For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; $ ghc hello.hs
 [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( hello.hs, hello.o ) Linking hello ... /usr/bin/ld.gold: fatal error: hello: Input/output error collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc&#x27; failed in phaseLinker&#x27;. (Exit code: 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 hello.hs is this program:
 haskell main &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Hello, World!&quot; 
 Any idea how I can get this to compile?

 This is my second Haskell library. It is a low-level library that creates a logical replication slot and streams changes to your program from your PostgreSQL server.
 It&#x27;s still experimental and ready for library authors and interested hackers to kick the tires and build real-time applications with it.
 Future plans include: - handling user-defined types - libraries based on conduit and other popular streaming packages
 Thanks for taking a look. And thanks to this community. I built this library from scratch on my stream and am grateful for those who&#x27;ve been watching and cheering me on. This is a library I&#x27;ve wanted for a while and I hope you enjoy it too!

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a way to convert a tuple into a &quot;type map&quot;.
 Example:
  val t: (Int, (String, Double)) &#x3D; (3, (&quot;Pi&quot;, 3.14)) val m &#x3D; toTypeMap(t) val i: Int &#x3D; m.get[Int] // returns 3 val s: String &#x3D; m.get[String] // returns &quot;Pi&quot; val d: Double &#x3D; m.get[Double] // returns 3.14 
 toTypeMap(t) should only compile if t contains no duplicate types, i.e. wouldn&#x27;t compile for an (Int, Int). Calling get[T] should only compile if the tuple contains the type T. 
 Perhaps &quot;type map&quot; is not the canonical name for this. What I&#x27;m thinking of is something like ZIO&#x27;s Env, basically a Map that lets you retrieve elements based on the type of the element.
 edit: the tuple doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be &quot;nested&quot;

                    <span>The &quot;RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial&quot; has just started. I&#x27;m going to attempt to follow along for the first time... and you can too! Week 1 has just started.
 WIP Roguelike
 I&#x27;ve made a little roguelike starter kit for Indigo to do some of the heavy lifting.
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit
 In truth I hope to stay ahead of the tutorial to make sure the starter kit has all the tools needed for anyone else having a go. I have to make sure it works somehow!
 You can follow my own progress here and use it as a reference if it helps:
 https://github.com/davesmith00000/roguelike-tutorial
 If you do have a go and get stuck, feel free to join the indigo Discord and say hello.

 (exec-path) Includes the added homebrew paths.
 (call-process &quot;ENV&quot; nil t) Does not include the added homebrew paths.
 Erlang shell: os:cmd(&quot;echo $PATH&quot;). Does not include the added homebrew paths. But does add its own path to erl: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/erlang/24.0.2_1/lib/erlang/erts-12.0.2/bin.
 How do correctly set that path so that the homebrew paths always appear?

                    <span>I never used EXWM, but if I&#x27;m not wrong it allows you to switch between different workspaces, where each workspace has its own frame configuration. For instance, I can do a vertical split in workspace 1, than move to workspace 2 which will be a new empty frame, not vertically splitted. Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn&#x27;t manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I&#x27;m currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window. Why you don&#x27;t just use EXWM, you might ask. Because for now I&#x27;m quite skeptical about its usefulness for me, so I want to take my time to understand if it&#x27;s something that might actually improve my workflow. In the meanwhile, I would really love a feature like the one described above. I started only very recently to use Emacs so sorry if the feature I&#x27;m looking for is something obvious or basic. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with emacs for a few days, mainly with org-mode, and I really like it and the idea of it. But, I&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface. I thought a way for me to get into using emacs would be learning a new language, and looked into C++. I found this great guide for using C++ with emacs, but frankly I&#x27;m a bit intimidated by how many extensions and how much configuration are required. It makes me want to just use a more standard IDE.
 I guess I have two questions for more experienced users: 1. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is coding with emacs at odds with using an IDE, and I should be looking at a different work flow entirely, rather than forcing emacs to have ide like features? 2. What sort of stands out for folks as the reason it was worth climbing up the emacs learning curve?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to set up lsp-mode to work with clangd, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any instructions anywhere. I&#x27;m under the impression that it&#x27;s supposed to just work, and I have a hook set up for c++ mode, but the result is lsp[disconnected] and no actual attempt to connect to clangd. Is there something else I need to do? clangd is on my path so it should be easy to find.

                    <span>As the title indicates, I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble finding the source files for the Elisp functions. Specifically, when I&#x27;m attempting to call
 M-x xref-find-definitions 
 in any buffer of any major mode. For example, running that function on 
 xref-find-definitions 
 in the info buffer causes emacs to return with
 Find definitions of (default xref-find-definitions): 
 so we hit  and are shown 
 Visit tags table (default TAGS): /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info 
 hit that  again and we get 
 File /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info/TAGS does not exist 
 (note that running 
 xref-etags-mode 
 doesn&#x27;t change anything)
 now I&#x27;m aware this has to do something with the &#x27;etags&#x27; shell command, but this only creates a tags table in a specific working directory. How would I configure so that I have a global tags table so that anywhere I could run 
 xref-find-definitions 
 and go take a look at the course code of a function?
 Thanks

The instructions at https://github.com/oantolin/orderless/issues/31#issuecomment-763908249 are thorough but don’t seem to override my usual behavior of allowing for orderless-initialism matches, and unlike the code suggested there, I do not want any matches to be made if a regexp search fails (much like how Swiper works. My config looks like this:
 (use-package orderless :init (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless) orderless-matching-styles &#x27;(orderless-literal orderless-regexp orderless-initialism) completion-category-defaults nil) :config (orderless-define-completion-style just-regexp (orderless-matching-styles &#x27;(orderless-regexp))) (setf (alist-get &#x27;consult-location completion-category-overrides) &#x27;(styles just-regexp)) (setq orderless-style-dispatchers &#x27;(without-if-bang)) (defun without-if-bang (pattern _index _total) (cond ((equal &quot;!&quot; pattern) &#x27;(orderless-literal . &quot;&quot;)) ((string-prefix-p &quot;!&quot; pattern) &#x60;(orderless-without-literal . ,(substring pattern 1)))))) 
 Thank you for any help!

                    <span>Hey Emacs lovers, I&#x27;ve updated the top-up for the Inside Emacs videos by adding the files and commands used in the last 3 videos on org-table I uploaded recently.
 This top-up is for you if you like the videos and:
  
you want the list of the commands used in the videos,
 or you want to practice your Emacs workflow by reproducing some of the actions in the videos with the files I&#x27;ve used.
  
For instance, if you&#x27;re interested on trying the commands related to exporting tables in org-mode we discussed in Inside Emacs #6 (part 6), you can:
  
find the commands in this section of the README,
 and try them with the org file org-table.org.
  
I hope this top-up can help you reduce the time between the moment you watched the video and the moment you&#x27;re able to do what&#x27;s in the video and much more.
 If there something missing in the top-up or you think of another way of presenting it, let me know.
 Have a nice day :)

                    <span>For a Gantt from org-mode project I use SVG to create the final chart. I use the  element to add information on tasks as a pop-up.
 This works nicely in a browser but not in the native emacs SVG viewer. I tried this in emacs 27 that comes with ubuntu 21.04 and in a freshly compiled version from https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git using the master branch.
 Any ideas on if this is possible and/or how to get this to work ?
 Thanks,
 Jouke

 So I&#x27;m in an org-table and I give it a simple addition like (+ 8 $4) But it seems to be multiplying (8 * the_number_in_column4) rather than the correct behavior of (8 + the_number_in_column4). 
 I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a mistake on my part and not emacs, but I&#x27;m very interested to see where I went wrong. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance and have a great day.

                    <span>(I think I finally fixed the formatting, didn&#x27;t realize I had to go into Markdown mode)
 I&#x27;d been searching for a while for a way to do this but couldn&#x27;t find it, so yesterday I sat down and coded my own. With this function and binding, when I hit Return on a file in Dired it either opens the file asynchronously in an external command if the file format-command combo is defined in dired-guess-shell-alist-user etc., or opens the file in Emacs as usual if the format is not bound to a command.
 (defun dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command () &quot;If there is a default command defined for this file type, run it asynchronously.If not, open it in Emacs.&quot; (interactive) (let ( ;; get the default for the file type, ;; putting the string into a list because dired-guess-default throws an error otherwise. (default (dired-guess-default (cons (dired-get-filename) &#x27;()))) ;; put the file name into a list so dired-shell-stuff-it will accept it (file-list (cons (dired-get-filename) &#x27;()))) (if (null default) ;; if no default found for file, open in Emacs (dired-find-file) ;; if default is found for file, run command asynchronously (dired-run-shell-command (dired-shell-stuff-it (concat default &quot; &amp;&quot;) file-list nil))))) ;; This function is bound to the Return key in dired-mode to replace the default behavior on Return (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command) ;; For added convenience: Don&#x27;t open a new Async Shell Command window (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist(cons &quot;\\*Async Shell Command\\*.*&quot; (cons #&#x27;display-buffer-no-window nil))) ;; Always open a new buffer if default is occupied. (setq async-shell-command-buffer &#x27;new-buffer) 
 These modification more or less &quot;complete&quot; Dired for me as a file manager for everyday use without annoyance or cognitive load. The shell command and async shell command functions and keys remain available for more involved stuff like multiple files, but for 95% of my uses this is sufficient.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m currently digging through Programming in Scala - Fifth Edition. While I generally like the new control syntax, now in chapter 9.4 I realize that it does not extend to user defined control structures. E.g given
 def myscope(byNameParam : &#x3D;&gt; Unit) : Unit &#x3D; println(&quot;BEGIN&quot;) byNameParam println(&quot;END&quot;) 
 I cannot use
 myscope println(&quot;test&quot;) 
 but instead still have to use
 myscope { println(&quot;test&quot;) } 
 This is slightly annoying. Will this restriction be lifted at some point?

                    <span>Hi everyone! I’ve been using zettelkästen on and off for 1/2 years. The problem is I have both physical and digital notes, which are not integrated. 
Also I think I’ve been doing it wrong the whole time since I only noted excerpts basically.
I was wondering how to fix it.
Should I divide literature and permanent notes?

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to using images in notes, and am finding they do not display in The Archive (but do in Obsidian).

Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks,

                    <span>edit: &quot;Grokking&quot; not &quot;Groking&quot;. Sorry for the typo in the title.
 I&#x27;m trying to &quot;grok emacs&quot;. I&#x27;ve heard high praises, the enlightenment, what not. I have not found it yet. Over the years:
  
Done emacs tutorials multiple times (forget most key bindings).
 Did org-mode tutorial once and created a huge org-mode daily-notes file. Abandoned it.
 Know scheme, and have done problems in it (but otherwise an experience C and python programmer). Can comfortably read and understand basic e-lisp, but otherwise I&#x27;m an e-lisp beginner.
 Now set up doom emacs (so evil mode; I&#x27;m an experienced vim+tmux+i3wm user).
 Did emacs tutorial one last time yesterday (all of it).
 Doing an org-mode daily notes file (this time probably I&#x27;ll stick with it).
  
So yeah, as you can see I have a mixed background. I&#x27;m …</span>

                    <span>I understand the emacs way to do this is to download a package for each file type/mode and use the indent functions specific to that mode, but not every package has an &quot;un-indent&quot; or &quot;shift left&quot; function. In these cases, they seem to expect you to manually delete white space in front of the line to un-indent. Also, working all of these different indent functions into my existing keybinds is annoying.
 I have a package (github) that detects the indentation offset and updates the tab-width variable in emacs. Does anyone have a package/function that can use this variable to indent/dedent single or multiple lines?
 Thank you

                    <span>Emacs 26.1 Unix (and 27.x on FreeBSD...)
 Is there a way to save the current line number of the buffer to make next emacs session of this file to open on this line number ? Or add a bunch of code in .emacs ??
 Ex: emacs journal ; editing at line 33; Ctrl-X -c;
 On minute later : emacs journal &#x3D;&#x3D; &gt; displays right on line 33

 Welcome screen (left) with SVG image and font variations converted to PS file (right)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for Images. Now you can print Emacs Welcome screen in all its glory.
 Cavaet: Since PS only supports JPG and bitmaps for images, SVG and PNG with transparency will require manual conversion for desirable output.
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

 And the file libSDL2_image.dll.a exists in C:\tools\msys64\mingw64\lib\libSDL2_image.dll.a
 I have no idea why it couldn&#x27;t load that DLL. Could anybody share some ideas?

                    <span>Hi all! 
 I received the following notice because I was subscribed to the &#x27;Intermediate Haskell&#x27; newsletter, but thought it might be worthwhile to know for other people on Reddit as well:
  
Hey! 
 You are receiving this email because you have subscribed to updates about the &#x27;Intermediate Haskell&#x27; book. 
 The book is cancelled. Vlad and Artyom and all other contributors have switched to other things. 
 [...] 
 Anything that we write will likely be announced on Twitter: https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u&#x3D;67b31bfe9303116749c079389&amp;id&#x3D;25c6c78b9d&amp;e&#x3D;3e3ab466bb is Vlad&#x27;s, and https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u&#x3D;67b31bfe9303116749c079389&amp;id&#x3D;97065ee399&amp;e&#x3D;3e3ab466bb is Artyom&#x27;s. 
 Bye!
  
Writing a book is a very large and difficult ordeal, so it is not strange for a book to be cancelled and I wish the authors the best &lt;3.
 Hopefully some other work(s) will fill the gap between &#x27;beginner&#x27; and &#x27;expert&#x27; material of Haskell in the (near?) future.

                    <span>I am creating a application that will make extensive use of the GUI in the Linux environment, I am not so interested in porting to Windows at this time, though perhaps I may in the future.
 I have tried using Gtk, wxHaskell, and Fltkhs, and all of them fail during compilation now. They clearly worked in the past, but apparently are not being maintained anymore.
 Now, at this point, I am prepared to fork one of them and bring it current for LTS 18.0 (and beyond), but I would rather not have to do that, as I want to just write the application, but will if I have to.
 Can anyone please point me to a GUI framework that compiles and links flawlessly with LTS 18.0 without a fuss? And why is there so little maintenance on these GUI frameworks to begin with?
 I will also be making use of FRP in this project, and many others to come, but they so far don&#x27;t seem to suffer from the same problems, for the most part.
 I would also prefer not to have to rely on Qt, as I did for a prior (non-Haskell) project, and they yanked the part I was heavily reliant on out of Open Source, the bloody bastards! :)
 Any suggestions at this point would be extremely helpful.

                    <span>Hi,
 Does anyone have minimum example to rendering string or font using GLFW-b in Haskell OpenGL ?
 Currently, I use GLUT to render string inside My Haskell OpenGL binding project.
  import qualified Graphics.UI.GLUT as GLUT GLUT.renderString GLUT.Roman &quot;Hello World&quot; 
 ​
 ​
 here is the code to render &quot;Hello World&quot;
  preservingMatrix $ do translate (Vector3 (u/2.0) 0 0 :: Vector3 GLdouble) GL.scale (1/scaleFont :: GL.GLdouble) (1/scaleFont) 1 GL.blend $&#x3D; GL.Disabled preservingMatrix $ GLUT.renderString GLUT.Roman &quot;Hello World&quot; GL.blend $&#x3D; GL.Enabled 
 ​
 ​
 Here is my Stack dependencies 
 ​
 stack ls dependencies
 GLFW-b 3.2.1.0 OpenGL 3.0.3.0 OpenGLRaw 3.3.3.0 GLUT 2.7.0.15 
 ​
 But the text is very bad and weird and hard to recognize the word.
 What I have tried so far.
 Disabled Blend when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 Disabled Lighting when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 ​
 Here is the image you can see how bad the font is using GLUT or I did something wrong.
 Can you recognize &quot;Hello World&quot;?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve gone round and round with this issue, i.e., how to add a non-Prelude package. I like to work with org-mode babel for Haskell, i.e., without a specific project directory, just babel source blocks interacting with a non-project REPL. My Emacs non-project Haskell stuff works, I&#x27;m guessing, because it&#x27;s relies on my ~/.stack/global-project. But let&#x27;s leave that aside for now.
 So let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m just trying to get a plain-vanilla project to work with an outside package. So I create a new project with stack new basicmath And let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to get Diagrams to work just like they give with the example code here, i.e., &quot;Your First Diagram.&quot; I&#x27;m trying all the install instructions at the command prompt in .../basicmath/, none work. I&#x27;m guessing something needs to happen with the basicmath.cabal or the stack.yaml? But I look in vain for any concrete examples. Confusing to me also is whether to actually use cabal when I&#x27;m supposed to be using stack. In any case, nothing works. How exactly would I make the example code work?
 I&#x27;d eventually like to see this work on the Emacs babel side, but I won&#x27;t get greedy yet. Emacs babel is just a wrapper apparently for feeding multiple lines into a non-project global REPL, i.e., fraught.
 A really good tutorial on this would be nice to find, BTW. Most of what I&#x27;ve seen is just someone&#x27;s stream-of-consciousness hypnosis ramblings, i.e., leaving a beginner to do guess-and-test over and over. And beginner books don&#x27;t talk about it either; rather, you simply put code in a file and load it at the REPL as you work through these books. (I did find one book that walks you through a project creation. But it has no example of adding a non-Prelude package.) Would another IDE handle adding packages better? What about VS Code?

                    <span>I cannot find a thread that compare mind map with org. I use mind map since 20 years, so I saw some video from org so far. It looks really beautiful, but cannot find advantages over mindmap software. What are a couple of advantages of org over mindmap apart because is built into the fabolous emacs system?

                    <span>Hello there,
 https://github.com/overdr0ne/gumshoe
 What is it?
 Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder. It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil&#x27;s jump list, but works more generically.
 Why?
 Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I’m getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim’s jump list which, in Evil’s implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn’t work when you’re not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I&#x27;d share.
 Does anyone do anything similar? Comments and suggestions welcome!

 Github use  tag in markdown to support fold effect[1] , how can i make it fold in Emacs too,
 markdown-mode[2] by Jason Blevins seems not have this function.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the Pillow package. If I type:
 ​
 from PIL import Image
 pic &#x3D; Image.new(0, 0)
 pic.
 ​
 I will get completions for the Image class. However if I do: 
 pic &#x3D; Image.open(&quot;pic.png&quot;)
 Followed by &quot;pic.&quot; I get no completions. If I call company-complete it says &quot;No completion found&quot;. Why am I not getting completions after Image.open? Is it something peculiar about the open call (the doc says it doesn&#x27;t actually load the image at the time you call open)? In vscode I do get proper completions for Image class after calling Image.open. Any thoughts? Thanks.

                    <span>Suppose that I have a buffer or region with a lot of lines like these:
 [[ 1.1, -4.2 ], [ 3.14, -2.718 ]], [[ 7, 8 ], [ -10, 33 ]], 
 Suppose, for example that I&#x27;d like to multiply each number by 777. What is the simplest way to achieve this?
 By simplest way, I mean writing no (or very little amount of) lisp code. Maybe there is an already existing package which solves the same (or similar) problem.
 One way I see is to convert this into an org table, and use org&#x27;s table capabilities to apply the math formula. But then I lose the format of the original buffer (I mean []&#x27;s, etc.). Losing the format is not a huge problem, but it would be better if the formatting was retained.

                    <span>For those (few?) of you running Fedora Silverblue, it might have happened that you lose track of which Emacs instance belongs to which toolbox container. 
 I came up with this code (feedback welcomed!) that I added to the :config section of my (use-package emacs...) block:
 (defvar hoagie-container-name nil &quot;Stores the name of the current container, if present.&quot;) (when (file-exists-p &quot;/run/.containerenv&quot;) ;; from http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_read_file_content.html ;; insert content in temp buffer rather than open a file (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents &quot;/run/.containerenv&quot;) (search-forward &quot;name&#x3D;&quot;) ;; move point to the line with the name (setq hoagie-container-name (cl-subseq (thing-at-point &#x27;line) 6 -2)))) ;; Identify the toolbox container for this Emacs instance in the frame title (setq frame-title-format &#x27;(&quot; %b @ &quot; (:eval hoagie-container-name)) icon-title-format &#x27;(&quot; %b @ &quot; (:eval hoagie-container-name)))) 
 I removed from my frame parameters (undecorated . t) for this. It could go in the modeline too, probably in misc-info: (push &#x27;(:eval hoagie-container-name) mode-line-misc-info).

 I haven&#x27;t gotten any groups to show up on the modeline. I&#x27;m not even sure how to test that the demon is running correctly with or without the notify package.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for two months now, for org-mode mostly and because I like Gnu projects. I haven&#x27;t learned Lisp yet and I&#x27;ve tried to customize Emacs Vanilla by reading and adding other people&#x27;s code. 
 This is my init.el and I&#x27;m going to add more code later, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s well written but until now I&#x27;ve got no errors and everything seems to work correctly.
 There is one thing at the moment that I still haven&#x27;t figured out. I would like to set a light theme for the org-mode buffer and keep the dark background for the other modes. 
 How would you modify my code to achieve this?

                    <span>I use org and org-roam v2 fairly extensively, and I&#x27;ve started thinking a little about how I might track some quantified-self metrics to play around with. 
 An example of this kind-of setup is Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s, detailed here: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/
 Or more generally: https://quantifiedself.com/
 I want to start tracking little aspects of myself in an open format, ideally co-located with my other notes. It&#x27;s fairly important that I can query the data I&#x27;m storing so that I can look for interesting bits of data or trends.
 A MVP of this might be a random prompt for a handful of questions: * How do you feel right now? 0-3 * How energetic do you feel right now? 0-3
 How might y&#x27;all implement something like this? Appending answers to a table using org-capture templates perhaps? Any tips or tricks? Have you implemented anything that rhymes with my thinking here?

 I have a toy project in Scala 3 and JavaFX. Not bad, but writing JavaFX in code is quite verbose, and FXML is even worse. So I thought I could devise a small dsl then expand it as I go, very similar to the builder pattern example on the Scala 3 reference. For example, I would like to write
 hbox { label { text &#x3D; &quot;Label&quot; } tableView[TestItem] { items ++&#x3D; Seq( TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;A&quot;)), TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;B&quot;)), TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;C&quot;)) ) tableColumn[TestItem, String] { text &#x3D; &quot;Column&quot; cellValueFactory[TestItem, String](_.getValue.a) } } } 
 The problem: both Label and Tabl…</span>

                    <span>I have been learning Scala for two years on my own whenever i get some free time .In a week i spent around 45 mins-1hour.I know I am not very good at it but I dont know what should i learn to improve.
 I have made a very small project : https://github.com/dionesh12/ETLFramework.
 If anyone could go through it and recommend as to how i should improve or should i quit while i am ahead if its really bad i will be extremely grateful

                    <span>I have been a python programmer for over a decade.
 I ventured into the world of scala a couple of years ago when I went in search for a better faster programming language and fell in love with functional programming. Now I work quite a lot in Scala.
 And yet, the ease of python is undeniable. So I was wondering if there was a way to call scala programs from python like you can do with c modules (with pybind for instance).
 I ran into ScalaPy but this does the opposite ie. It enables calling python routines from scala. I am looking for the opposite.
 I figured ScalaNative would perhaps enable this since this does not depend on JVM. Futhermore, I guess it is also faster then Scala. Can any one point me in the right direction?

                    <span>Hi All, In Scala, I am trying understand the usage of companion object for class, trait and case class . All I know is by using the companion object with we can access the private methods and variables of companion object and can access in class/trait/case class . I want to organize my code based on the features provided by them but not sure how. For example, I am writing all my utility methods in object and service method in classes which is fine but end up writing too many functions in object(for utilities). From the real time application development perspective how can we take advantage of the features of companion object, case class, class and trait to organize the code.
 And is there additional features/ difference for the companion object across those three

                    <span>Super glad to be part of this community of top-level researchers! Hope to become as good as you soon.
I have a couple of questions, however;
I don&#x27;t want to start with a digital zettelkasten, so I&#x27;ve started the process of acquiring a novelink box and index cards from Amazon. But info online is considerably vague. I know I&#x27;m to use my fleeting notes for quick ideas or notes as they come, then my literature note is for learning purposes before transferring to my permanent note, then finally transfer singular ideas into my zettels. My question is how do I use this while reading a book or taking an online course? What do I need to transfer between these notes? How do I know I&#x27;m taking the ideal note? Do I look at it from the context of why I&#x27;m studying the note/book/course, or I&#x27;m to maintain an open mind?
Also, I don&#x27;t know if there are copywriters in this group, but how can I use this method to boost my research ability? How do you use your zettelkasten system to research?
Thanks for your answers!</span>

                    <span>What are the main differences between org-reveal (the one that&#x27;s still maintained) and org-re-reveal?
 Is one better/easier to use? I&#x27;ve only used org-reveal because that seems to be the most recommended/popular, and it works mostly fine, though I find the documentation rather poor.

                    <span>I am currently trying kotllin for competitive programming and I need a new file for each new problem. However lsp-mode keeps telling me &quot;Conflicting declarations: public val OUTPUT: PrintStream!, public val OUTPUT: PrintStream!.&quot; for every global variable or function (OUTPUT is defined both in A/main.kt and B/main.kt). Is there a way to bypass this? If not, then I probably need to run different language server for every problem file/directory. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do that. Is there an option to specify project root while starting lsp-mode?

 &gt; If ‘notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert’ is set (the default) then
 &gt; the header should be of the form &quot;folder +tag1 -tag2&quot; where
 &gt; folder is the folder (relative to the notmuch mailstore) to store
 &gt; the message in, and tag1 and tag2 are tag changes to apply to the
 &gt; stored message.
 I have the following line:
 notmuch-fcc-dirs &#x27;((&quot;.*&quot; . &quot;sent -unread&quot;))
 To save my mail in sent and remove the unread tag. However when I send an email it asks me if I want to create the directory and it creates &#x27;sent -unread&#x27;. As opposed to creating &#x27;sent&#x27; and removing the tag unread. notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert is set to t.
 If I remove the -unread it works fine. Is my syntax wrong?
 Thanks.

 To solve this, I use the term mode for any interactive command. But is there any ways to use Emacs shell to enter gpg passphase?
 I have read some materials about pinentry-emacs. However, most of them are outdated.

                    <span>Hello guys! how are yall doing?
 Well I am a new user to emacs, I use a lot of text editing, mainly VSCODE and mainly with git. 
 I am currently facing an issue with Magit and I wanna ask you if you can point me out to a solution as I already did some research but found nothing.
 So, I have a repo cloned using HTTPS protocol. I can push new branches to origin normally using the command &quot;git push origin [branch-name]&quot;.
 Now when I try to push my branch using magit, (P u - type the upstream branch name - [RET]) I am getting:
 (fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights
 and the repository exists.)
 I found some people having issues like this one but when using SSH protocol for their repos, but in my case as, I said, I am using HTTPS protocol and it works normally using terminal.
 If you can point me out to a solution for this issue I would appreciate it :)
 the log shows me this...
 git … push -v --set-upstream [my-branch]\:refs/heads/
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi
 Working in Windows emacs 27.2
 I would love to use the functionality of radio targets in my org file. If you dont know it see: https://orgmode.org/manual/Radio-Targets.html
 Therefore I have heading * dictionary &gt;&gt; bla blub * my org text Text mydefinition is then highlighted as link.
 Now the problem
 When I klick the link on mydefinition. I would expect it to jump to the position of &gt;&gt; 
 Instead emacs pops a file dialog and asks for &quot;Visit TAGS table&quot;
 Generating TAGS files seems rocket science to me and Documentation is really scattered and not consistent at all for this. For windows even worse. Does anybody use this? Is it outdated functionality or could it be configured to just work out of the box? Does it work on linux without special installations?
 Thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;ve set up emacs for python using python-language-server and lsp. When I open a python file, the top line of emacs shows the directory elements and the file name. The file name will have a squiggly line under it if the file is not formatted correctly. But also the directory elements have squiggly lines under them (whether or not the file name does). Sometimes they go away, but I&#x27;m not sure what I do that makes them go away. What do the squiggly lines under the directory elements mean and how to make them go away? Thanks

                    <span>Hi all,
 Major noob here looking for some pointers on their first project. The aim of the project is to pull data down from multiple entity&#x27;s public REST APIs (let&#x27;s call them cryptocurrency exchanges). For each entity, I have to make numerous individual API calls without breaching that entity&#x27;s API rate limit. The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.
 Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? 
 If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity&#x27;s rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>This is easily unnoticed in the new Scala 3 documentation and I think its worth a shout out:
  
Scala 2&#x27;s somewhat puzzling behavior with respect to ambiguity has been exploited to implement the analogue of a &quot;negated&quot; search in implicit resolution, where a query Q1 fails if some other query Q2 succeeds and Q1 succeeds if Q2 fails. With the new cleaned up behavior these techniques no longer work. But there is now a new special type scala.util.NotGiven which implements negation directly. For any query type Q, NotGiven[Q] succeeds if and only if the implicit search for Q fails.

                    <span>Introduction
 When I saw opaque types and inline methods, I quickly thook about type-level assertions evaluated at compile time. I was pretty hyped by this idea so I made Iron.
 Iron uses Dotty&#x27;s inline and opaque types to create almost zero-overhead (and true zero-overhead for the next Scala 3 release) type constraints for Scala. It also supports runtime constraints.
 Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean &quot;without macro/black magic&quot;). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.
 Usage
 Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.
 Example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*
 inline def log(x: Double &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Greater[0d]): Double &#x3D; Math.log(x) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>Not strictly a Zettelkasten, but almost. I was ready &quot;How to write mathematics&quot; by P. R. Halmos. and on page 134, he discusses how he organizes a book or long article:

  
At one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it&#x27;s mentioned.


Emphasis mine.
It is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>Hi, emacs newbie here. I wanted to start using emacs for c, c++, scheme and python programming and first researched auto-completion extensions. I came across auto-complete and company-mode, but most of the discussions I found about them (even on this subreddit) were very old. There were discussions about company-mode being easier, but not supporting docstrings.
 I just want to know as of 2021, how good they are, what about speed? memory? do they work in terminals? how easy are they? does company-mode now support docstrings? Any feedback would be really appreciated.

                    <span>I recently installed emacs and doom emacs on top of it. And its cool and all but i have one question. When ever i launch emacs why is it that the vanilla emacs first starts and then the doom emacs screen comes up? Is that normal? Like when i launch emacs first theres like the normal emacs you get without doom and then like 5 seconds later doom emacs launches.

                    <span>Is it possible to configure whitespace-mode to display only leading whitespace? When displaying whitespace, I find that the space indicators in between words is a bit too much and makes it harder to read, but I really like the idea of just seeing leading whitespace to check indentation etc.
 I&#x27;ve played around with the whitespace-style customization option a fair bit, but haven&#x27;t managed to do what I want. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>The problem occurs with the pcase-let binding in the function below. In the original source buffer it fails to bind and the variables are nil. I copied over the function into another buffer, re-evaluated, and it works. I can only guess it has something to do with the back-quote but I have no idea. Anyone know?

                    <span>Hi!
 My assumption is that Haskell has no support for a scenario where a client ought to be authenticated (certificate send and verified) as part of establishing a TLS connection. OnCertificateRequest function does not seem to be called back.
 We see a lot of code examples such as this one:
  creds  return creds , onServerCertificate &#x3D; \_ _ _ _ -&gt; return [] } clientParams &#x3D; (defaultParamsClient hostName &quot;&quot;) { clientHooks &#x3D; hooks , clientSupported &#x3D; def { supportedCiphers &#x3D; ciphersuite_all } } tlsSettings &#x3D; TLSSettings clientParams 
 For Windows 10 and ghc 8.4.3 has someone gotten onCertificateRequest called back?
 Regards
 Juuso

                    <span>I finally got around to play a bit with and found that it needed some tweaks on Spacemacs, here&#x27;s what I am using at the moment:
 In my layers I use just this:
 (haskell :variables haskell-completion-backend &#x27;lsp) 
 I found that this helps quite a bit (in user-config):
 ; differentiate between code-actions from wingman or others (defun lsp-code-action-by-is (is) (let* ((actions (seq-filter (lambda (x) (funcall is (string-prefix-p &quot;refactor.wingman&quot; (gethash &quot;kind&quot; x)))) (lsp-code-actions-at-point))) (action (lsp--select-action actions))) (lsp-execute-code-action-by-kind (gethash &quot;kind&quot; action)) (if (action) (lsp--execute-code-action action)))) (defun wingman-code-action () (interactive (lsp-code-action-by-is (lambda (x) x)))) (defun non-wingman-code-action () (interactive (lsp-code-action-…</span>

                    <span>I have the desire for a top level function. It feels artificial to me to put it in an object that I have to name with an arbitrary noun when I just want to refer to it by its verb method name. So I was toying with this pattern.
 object FormatCurrency { private lazy val instance &#x3D; NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance def apply(num: BigDecimal): String &#x3D; instance.format(num) } 
 so I can call it like FormatCurrency(1.00).
 What do y&#x27;all think? Should it be formatCurrency to make it look more like a function and less like a class constructor?
