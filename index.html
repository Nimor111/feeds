                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m new to emacs and I just installed ivy, counsel, swiper, flycheck, paredit and the base company packages. I think all that is left is an auto-completion package (if there are other stuff I might need but don&#x27;t know, please say so).
 In my search for auto-completion packages, I came across rtags, irony, ycmd and cquery, I&#x27;ve seen comments about rtags and irony not being good for large projects (although rtags can handle larger projects than irony). I&#x27;ve also heard that rtags wouldn&#x27;t work if there are many errors and that there were some problems when the irony server was up for long. I visited ycmd&#x27;s repo, and it seems to now be unmaintained: abingham/emacs-ycmd: Emacs client for ycmd, the code completion system. (github.com) 
 Many people said that they were interested in cquery, but most of what I found was from a few years back, so I just wanted to ask how far have these packages come? can I use a combination of them at once? are there stuff that one is better at than the rest at?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;m very interested in using emacs to write college papers, since I do all of my note taking and organizing on there as well. However, the formatting requirements have left me stuck writing papers in LibreOffice. The research I&#x27;ve done is mostly geared towards people writing technical papers, not general English/non-technical papers. Does anyone on here use emacs to write papers? Are there any special tools or features you use that make it easier?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m doing some programming exercises from a site called exercism, because even simple programming problems can be fun and give you an opportunity to learn things. One of the exercises is about detecting anagrams in a list.
 There are lots of ways to do it, but decided to try something that was less about manually iterating through the characters in a word myself and more about using built-in functionality.
 (defun anagrams-for (word anagram-list) (cl-loop for drow in anagram-list with tmp-drow &#x3D; drow unless (equal (downcase word) (downcase drow)) do (setq tmp-drow drow) unless (cl-mismatch (cl-sort word &#x27;&lt; :key &#x27;downcase) (cl-sort drow &#x27;&lt; :key &#x27;downcase)) collect tmp-drow)) 
 First, that with tmp-drow &#x3D; drow absolutely does not work as I expect. The cl-loop is supposed to set variables in a let* manner, but when that with is called, drow is still unset. That&#x27;s why I do the setq later.
 Second, cl-sort is destructive, so I thought I&#x27;d be able to copy the value into tmp-drow and avoid the rearranging of pointers that it performs. However, that&#x27;s not the case. Is there a way to explicitly make a copy of the data, not just what&#x27;s being pointed to?

I tried using Corfu, everything works fine as expected but whenever I try to use corfu in c-mode buffers while using Elgot as LSP client and ccls as server, it doesn&#x27;t show me any completions whereas Corfu works for me in Zig, Rust, Python and JavaScript modes. Can anyone help me?
 I also tried vertico, but it doesn&#x27;t show completions for everything like if I press :e in normal state while using Evil mode, it doesn&#x27;t show me completions. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, can you guys help me out!

                    <span>So i don&#x27;t like vim &quot;hjkl&quot; model, and installed doom emacs to try out some alternatives. I really like default binds shown in tutorial like C-v / M-v / C-f / C-b / C-n / C-p / C-u etc.
 I was really disillusioned when i discovered that tutorial does not apply (evil). Tried to disable evil manually but now space doesn&#x27;t do anything. 
 I always first learn the tool, then customize/ tinker with, so i would really appreciate any advice on &#x27;out-of-the box variation&quot; like doom that is not evil.

                    <span>I have used lsp mode with web mode along with some other minor modes for web app developments. But the performance was too bad for me, of course i don&#x27;t have a state of art computer (pretty old one actually), but thats really no excuse for pure performance, by poor performance i meant ram usage, speed, processor usage etc. For example when working on a react project in typescript (tsx created by CRA), the ram usage increased up to several gb and eventually or immediate there were input lags and really slow and sluggish performance. meanwhile i found vscode very performant on same machine on same project. lsp isn&#x27;t slow for any other mode, i use it frequently for go, python, c/c++, they work smoothly. Then i tried out tide in web mode, and boy it was a good change. tide works out of the box, very well, fast enough and it didn&#x27;t eat up so much ram either. i am not very familiar to elisp tracebacks, so just moved on to tide, instead of going deeper. i feel somewhat guilty for that, but i just don&#x27;t know where to start or where to look at, cause lsp-mode code is huge and i don&#x27;t know where to begin.
 Anyway, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you find any solution? I looked into the git issues but not much luck. I am liking tide very much, great project.
 If you are wondering about my emacs configs here they are.

                    <span>Hi. Please help me implement alternating background color under each section in emacs outline minor mode. Org mode has this feature where each section (the region between headings) have a different background color to help you see the different regions of text better. Magit also has this feature. Please advise. Thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs and org-mode at work for note taking and task management. Until now I&#x27;ve used my own laptop for this and it&#x27;s been working very well. I&#x27;m also looking to integrate org-roam in my workflow as soon as v2 is stable.
 We&#x27;ve only recently been handed work laptops, so currently I&#x27;m travelling with both laptops, which is not really convenient. As the work laptop (Windows 10) is heavily secured (no admin access, no installs of apps in user context either, lots of security-related logging and alerts, ssh client disabled), I guess that the only way to use emacs on this thing is over https (which is monitored as well, mind you). I do have experience with self-hosting some stuff on my own domain, so I&#x27;m looking for a web application I can self-host which allows me to use emacs over a web browser.
 There are many pieces of information about this, such as
  
shell apps: gotty, web-console, gateone, shellinabox, butterfly, webssh: most seem no longer maintained and there&#x27;s no clear indication regarding conflicts with key mappings between the browser/app and emacs ;
 more specific emacs/orgmode apps: cloudmacs, organice, orgmodweb, filestash, org-web: they are more limited by nature, but I might use them if they have support for custom agenda views which I use heavily ;
 the use of chrome web app mode or spacemacs to resolve the keymapping problem.
  
So, before going through each and every combination, or having to torture my muscle memory, does anybody have a thorough (and positive) experience of using emacs, or at least org-mode, in a browser on a daily basis ?

                    <span>Did someone manage to setup eglot correctly with straight.el? I would like to give it a try (lsp-mode is somewhat too bloated for my taste), but it looks as if there is some friction between those packages. For example both of those issues are still present although are marked as closed.

                    <span>I use spacemacs with a ton of packages and memory-report says this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Estimated Emacs Memory Usage
 65.8 MiB Overall Object Memory Usage 26.8 MiB Reserved (But Unused) Object Memory 12.1 MiB Memory Used By Global Variables 6.7 MiB Memory Used By Symbol Plists 1.3 MiB Total Buffer Memory Usage 0.0 KiB Total Image Cache Size
 Object Storage
 25.7 MiB Vectors 18.2 MiB Strings 17.9 MiB Conses 3.0 MiB Symbols 1.1 MiB Intervals 22.3 KiB Buffer-Objects 6.3 KiB Floats &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 A quick glance tells me that&#x27;s &lt;200MiB which sounds about right.
 However, top reports Emacs as using ~583MiB in total and this climbs to gigabytes over the course of a few days. Emacs never uses this memory more than once because it&#x27;s almost always swapped out.
 I have disabled GC because it makes Emacs a stuttery mess but I set up a trigger set up to GC whenever Emacs loses focus (which is often) and doing a manual GC doesn&#x27;t change anything about Emacs&#x27; RAM usage.
 This is happening on both Linux and OSX with 27.2 and 28.5.
 Does your Emacs ever give memory back to the OS?
 How big is the delta between the tallied-up memory-report and real-world usage? (as reported by top in its USED metric (RSS + SWAP).

                    <span>Hello there,
 In the past couple of years that I&#x27;ve been using emacs, I&#x27;ve never had a reason to give org-mode a try, but now I do. I Installed linux and wordpress on a raspberry-pi-4(which I&#x27;m going to use as a local web server to host the blog), and was able to get wordpress up and running nicely with some themes and plugins.
 When searching: does emacs work with wordpress, I saw this org2blog emacs package: https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog .
 Anyways, my goal is to use this local pi linux web server to host a simple wordpress blogging website. At 1st I just want to have a single web page, where I post a professional photo of myself with a hyperlink to my github projects. Eventually, I would like to do full blown blog posts with all kinds of stuff, like for example, if I&#x27;m applying for a particular freelance project, lets say python web scraping, I would want to create a simple python web-scraping application, push the completed project to github, then write a blog post, where I show step by step with coding blocks, how I developed and built the application from scratch. That way I can demonstrate to the client that I have the necessary skills required to complete that particular freelance gig.
 If there&#x27;s any extra wordpress themes/plugins that you&#x27;d recommend for this use-case, then let me know.
 Also, I&#x27;m new to wordpress, so I&#x27;m not sure how remote wordpress development works, I would like to develop the blog using emacs on my laptop, test it to make sure that it works correctly and does not crash wordpress, then push the changes remotely to wordpress on the pi linux web server.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>When defining a custom record type to match some table, I sometimes want to use record field types other than the default ones assumed by opaleye.
 E.g. for a (Field SqlNumeric), I don&#x27;t want to use a Scientific in the Haskell record type when the scale of the postgresql NUMERIC field is 0; it makes more sense to use Integer instead of Scientific. Similarly, if a column is of a domain that constrains the value to be non-negative, it may make more sense to use an unsigned type such as Word64 instead of Int64.
 Consider the following code:  data Rec&#x27; a b &#x3D; Rec { a :: a, b :: b } type Rec1 &#x3D; Rec&#x27; Scientific Scientific type Rec2 &#x3D; Rec&#x27; Integer Integer type RecField &#x3D; Rec&#x27; (Field SqlNumeric) (Field SqlNumeric) $(makeAdaptorAndInstance &quot;pRec&quot; &#x27;&#x27;Rec&#x27;) recTable :: Table RecField RecField recTable &#x3D; table &quot;rec&quot; (pRec Rec { a &#x3D; tableField &quot;a&quot;, b &#x3D; tableField &quot;b&quot; }) 
 If I try to use selectTable recTable and runSelect to read a [Rec1] it&#x27;s fine, but if I try to read a [Rec2], I get a compilation error (No instance for (Opaleye.Internal.RunQuery.DefaultFromField SqlNumeric Integer). How can I simply map the table to a record type that uses Integer instead of Scientific without adding much boilerplate? I only need to read the tables, not write to them.

Of course I don&#x27;t agree in entirety. BTW, Not all runway fashion is impractical (example).

                    <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m fairly new to org-mode, and have just been familiarizing myself with the basics for the past few days. After going through some excellent posts, I decided to try out org-mode for taking down and organizing lecture notes, and thought I could first try it out on a MOOC that I am taking.
 Now to the real question. As someone who has always taken down notes on paper using a pen, I do not plan to move away from it, and infact would like to org-mode to supplement it. Being a grad student in Computer Science, and Engineering, I realize that apart from taking down notes on a paper, I would need to annotate PDFs, to add notes that, have blocks of code from different stages at different points in the notes.
 Thus, I may potentially have upto 5 sources of notes (yes, seems like a lot): (i) a majority on pen-paper, (ii) annotations in a PDF, (iii) normal notes and points in a normal org-mode text window, and (iv) blocks of code and (v) diagrams. Is there a good way to combine these different sources in org-mode and make it seem streamlined and efficient? Essentially, a good workflow for me to add pdf&#x27;s and diagrams/code to my pen-paper notes and organize them. Is it even feasible, as I am still fairly new to org-mode?
 Breaking it to a simpler need, what is the best workflow to integrate lecture slides (with annotations) with handwritten notes? 
 Note: Please don&#x27;t provide answers such as &quot;Just listen in class don&#x27;t take notes constantly, or you will miss out&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m someone who relies on writing a lot to understand information, and pen-paper notes has worked well for me. I would love to supplement it with other sources to make it better :)
 Edit: I have come across org-noter, and though I find it to be cool, I don&#x27;t understand most of it, and it seems for a pro-org-mode user! If someone does suggest it, I&#x27;d highly appreciate it if someone explains what it does for a noob user.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs + LSP to program in C# and Unity and after using auto-completion several times my memory usage goes above 2GB RAM. Even with garbage-collect the RAM usage only goes to about 2GB and never less. Also, this is not a problem of omnisharp as it&#x27;s memory usage won&#x27;t go above the 100MB RAM.
 How can I fix this?
 This is the memory report before and after using LSP and completions:

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 The title says almost everything. I came across this amazing tool based on remark.js called xaringan, but every single tutorial that I read is based on using Rstudio as the suite to create and visualize the slides.
 I would like to use this library on Emacs, but honestly I am not familiar with R and this is the closest post that I found where they dedicate a single paragraph to say that you can use xaringan on Emacs by using the packages Emacs Speaks Statistics ess combined with surf browser.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Found the working js-doc snippet from here.
 Which outputs to
 /** *  * @param {} port - * @param {[]} methods - * @param {} host - * @return */ var connect &#x3D; function(port, methods, host) { 
 I was just wonder how can I have a dynamic cursor inside the parenthesis and at the last of the line, something like
 /** * $0 * @param {$1} port - $2 * @param {$3} methods - $4 * @param {$5} host - $6 * @return */ var connect &#x3D; function(port, methods, host) { 
 So that I can manually enter the type and description on the dynamic cursor positions. Any idea??

                    <span>Have you suffered from these symptoms...
  
Have you been stuck about when to use setq versus defvar? 
 Does it hurt when you see one allows documentation but not the other?
 
 Do your non-Lisp friends think setq is a strange name to define variables?
 Do your fingers cramp knowing there&#x27;s no unified definition interface for variables &amp; functions?
 Do you want to have an elegant, lightweight, syntax for furnishing functions and variables with runtime type checks? ---Including complex checks between function arguments!
  
Dr. Musa&#x27;s “L”anguage “F”eatures lf-define macro cures all ills!
 Come one, come all! Emacs lisp is a no-holds-barred! ⇒ Repo link ⇐

                    <span>As far as I know the Base type family is used to be able to work with normal recursive types like the standard list type instead of data ListF a b &#x3D; Cons a b | Nil.
 I guess there are alternative approaches, but I lack the appropriate terms to reasearch further. Every tip is appreciated.
 The question arose, because I translate Kmett&#x27;s recursion schemes to my own typed language that unfortunately doesn&#x27;t support type families.

                    <span>I am following Get Programming in Haskell by Will Kurt and in Unit1 Ch.5 closures are introduced.
 Specifically Listing 5.5 shows
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 genHostRequestBuilder host &#x3D;
 (\apiKey resource id -&gt; getRequestURL host apiKey resource id) 
 exampleUrlBuilder &#x3D; genHostRequestBuilder &quot;http://amazon.com&quot;
 genApiRequestBuilder hostBuilder apiKey &#x3D;
 (\resource id -&gt; hostBuilder apiKey resource id)
 myExampleUrlBuilder &#x3D; genApiRequestBuilder exampleUrlBuilder &quot;api-key&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 where closures are being used to make a function that at first accepts host, api key, resource, id as parameters but in the end just the resource and id since the host and api key are often redundant when making api calls to the same site.
 My attempt at the above was different but I&#x27;m able to get the correct answer, ie. a valid url to make an api request
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 exampleUrlBuilder2 &#x3D; exampleUrlBuilder &quot;my-api-key&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Thus it seems like this closure is overly complicated and in the process I discovered that I can create an alias for a function partially applied to one parameter? What is the advantage of the textbook&#x27;s way of using a closure here instead of what I did?

                    <span>Normally take :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] takes the specified number of elements or less, if the list appeared shorter than expected. Now if you wish to distinguish between these cases, you need to check that length (take n xs) &#x3D;&#x3D; n. This is wasteful.
 I&#x27;d like to define takeFoo :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; (Int, [a]), which tells immediately how many elements were successfully taken. What is the best name for such function?
 (If you are wondering about my context, this is actually not about lists, but about Text, where length is very expensive).

 The first Plutus Pioneer Program had 1,500 students. The second cohort is underway with over 2,800 students learning to code both Plutus and Haskell programming languages.
 Plutus is based on Haskell and will be used to create smart contracts on Cardano.

                    <span>Hi all,
 Just wanted to share my final year university project repo which was implementing a language very similar to Elm:
 https://github.com/georgegarrington/Syphon
 Megaparsec used for parser, Hindley-Milner system (albeit I never implemented let polymorphism) based on this Cornell course used for the type system and custom transpiler made without using a string template library, didn&#x27;t know this was a thing until after the deadline haha oops. Transpiles to ES6 making use of arrow functions for currying and uses React and Electron, useReducer hook in React is essentially the Elm architecture so this was used, and useEffect hook was used to implement subscriptions.
 Would love to know anyone&#x27;s feedback at an amateur attempt at language implementation, and also hope this might help people working on a similar project :)

                    <span>Here is a discussion of newtype. Note 
 newtype State s a &#x3D; State { runState :: s -&gt; (s, a) } 
 And then later
 State :: (s -&gt; (s, a)) -&gt; State s a runState :: State s a -&gt; (s -&gt; (s, a)) 
 which I assume are only the type id&#x27;s from doing :t. Good. And I think I understand that since s -&gt; (s, a) , i.e., (s, a) is a tuple, we are not violating the one-parameter restriction of a newtype. But what does s -&gt; (s, a) mean, i.e., what is a function doing in a type declaration? I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve never run across this before. Also, what could this type be used for?

Cast Haskell values with Witch by Taylor Fausak
I’m happy to announce Witch, a library that aims to make those conversions easy and painless. This post will explain my motivation for creating the library and show some examples of how to use it.
Cheap interpreter, part 4: stack machines by Gary Verhaegen
In this post, we’re going to explore a completely different approach: we’re first going to design a stack machine, then write an interpreter for the stack machine language, and finally write a compiler from our toy language parse tree to stack machine instructions.

                    <span>In a major mode, I use general to assign &quot;SPC b b&quot; to command. How do I assign a string to appear under &quot;SPC b&quot; in the which-key popup, only for this specific major mode? My current setup carries the string into other modes, which I don&#x27;t want.
 Currently, I do (something similar to) the following
  (general-create-definer jl/major-modes :keymaps &#x27;(normal visual operator motion) :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; ) (jl/major-modes :keymaps &#x27;org-mode-map &quot;b&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :which-key: &quot;Babel&quot;)) 
 If I have another key under &quot;SPC b _&quot; in another mode, which-key still displays &quot;Babel&quot; as &quot;SPC b&quot;, rather than the usual &quot;prefix&quot;.
 I have tried looking through the documentation for both general.el and which-key, but I can&#x27;t find the correct way to set a prefix string.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking for a workaround to the M-TAB keybinding because on my OS it switch between opened windows. Are there any built-in alternatives?
 (M-TAB should call the pcomplete command which, when called after the \ character, shows the possible completions e.g. \real, \alpha ecc.)

 I&#x27;m thinking perhaps some sort of query of the elfeed database from Org agenda though I&#x27;m not sure how one might go about that... org-ql?
 Anybody come up with a similar flow?

                    <span>hej fellow &#x27;macsers,
 I am in the process of tuning my configuration so as to recognise different machines and act upon it - for instance by executing particular functions or loading particular files. For this, I rely upon information outside of emacs such as environment variables and/or the desktop resolution.
 In one function, I was able to successfully use (getenv &quot;HOME&quot;). However, in another function, (getenv &quot;HOST&quot;) evaluates to nil even though echo $HOST does show a legitimate value (though it does not show in printenv funnily enough...). Also, environment variables that I have set in my .zshrc and which show up in printenv cannot be called upon.
 Any tips / tricks are very welcome!
 Have a good day :)

 I don&#x27;t know where to look. I tried searching the error, but I can&#x27;t seems to find anything related.
 My Emacs config is here https://github.com/vfsoraki/emacs.d
 I used Emacs in Linux and Mac, and both have the same problem.
 I&#x27;m using Straight to install and manage my packages. I took a guess and tried loading projectile before Magit, but it did not solve my issue.
 I don&#x27;t know where to look. Any tip on how to debug this will be more than useful, thanks!

 Prodigy: For my job I often have to run various web servers locally, and Prodigy is the best (only?) way that I&#x27;ve found to do that all within Emacs. You can define individual services, and then bring up an overview buffer from which you can start, stop, and view the status of each service. You can also bring up an output buffer for each running service. It has some neat features like being able to define custom statuses for a service that will be triggered based on the output -- for example, when developing locally, I have a couple of services that are set to automatically…</span>

                    <span>Hi
 I want to learn emacs. I am a long time vim user, not planning on learning emacs for just text manipulation.
 I have done some basic elisp coding. But by brain never thinks like lisp.
 Found this amazing video that blew my mind. I am looking for more advanced level emacs/elisp videos, to get over my initial inhibition and think more lisp like. Please share.

                    <span>For a project I&#x27;m working on, I need to parse existing Haskell files into some representation that is able to process them. In a perfect world, there would just be a library that allows for a deep embedding of Haskell inside Haskell. Does something like this exist?
 Maybe I could use parts of ghcide or hls, since they obviously need some way of working with source code, though I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible. (and in case it is, if it&#x27;s a good idea)
 Maybe something like this could be done in template Haskell, but I don&#x27;t know a lot about TH.
 A library that compiles haskell down to System FC would also be fine, though not perfect since I later need to generate haskell.
 Has anybody had a similar task?
 How did you solve it?
 Thanks in advance!

 STORM lets you write expressive and auditable security policies with the data model. The policies are enforced via compile-time refinement type checking with LiquidHaskell.

                    <span>I am trying to learn Haskell. And thought that it would be a good idea to be able to use VS Code for simple code writing during the process of learning.
 Has anybody else faced this? I would think that ideally I should point VS Code extension to the Haskell-stack installed GHC. Not sure how and don&#x27;t know if that is ideal or unnecessary.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t mean TODO keywords, I mean those that start with &#x27;#+&#x27; like &#x27;#+TODO&#x27;, &#x27;#+begin_src&#x27; etc.?
 Is there some established API? I have tried to search, but I am just getting hits for TODO keywords :-(. Maybe I am searching for wrong term.

                    <span>Following this post of mine. From everyone answer (thanks guys!), I also thought that Scala code may be slow because of JVM slow warmup and startup time. So, I decide to quick implement the java code with almost exactly the same to Scala code to the same merged two sorted list problem. And here is the computing time and memory used.
 Scala, Rust, Python and Java computing time and space
 But what I found is that even Java doesn&#x27;t have the same JVM problem! Java is even on par with Rust! (It may not exactly equal though, because the time unit is too large)
 So, what is the cause of slowness in Scala then?

 I do &quot;successful&quot; PKM for more than a decade (check this out http://hg.defun.work/tips/) figuring everything &amp; building tooling around myself.
 I split data into projects each in own Mercurial repository for syncing:
  
private info (contacts, medic records, etc)
 semiprivate info (shops, contractors, equipment)
 tips in RST format (HTML compiler preview: http://tips.defun.work/)
 cooking in RST format
 blog in MD/RST/Asciidoc/txt formats (for curious http://blog.defun.work/)
 dump with WIP blog posts (2MiB of RST text)
 per employer notes each in a single file (contacts, creds, etc) in Org mode
 dump with notes in Org format - everything else goes here
  
I use Org mode only for one reason: it is possible to mark a section as DO…</span>

                    <span>Hi! I started using notmuch in Emacs as my mail client today. It was quite easy to set up and now I have two email inboxes synced via isync. The issue is that notmuch doesn&#x27;t seem to distinguish the two. As the ones I&#x27;m currently using are my private ones, it doesn&#x27;t matter a ton but I&#x27;d like to bring in my (much! more spammy) gmail and school mail, and would therefore like to know if there is an easy way to separate them.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I have a problem related to cosmetics that isn&#x27;t that pressing, but I am frustrated I can&#x27;t figure out it. I&#x27;m on Windows 10 x64 running emacs 27.2 and org 9.4.4.
 I&#x27;ve added 
 (setq org-ellipsis &quot; ▾&quot;) 
 to my .emacs
 After loading that, when I open an .org file, the character shows up as &quot; â¾&quot; ; same for with describe-variable -&gt; org-ellipsis. I visit my .emacs, M-x eval-buffer and then reopen the org file and it&#x27;s fixed. 
 Any ideas? Is there something weird with encoding?
 I wondered if the font used in my headings didn&#x27;t support that character, but &quot;C-x 8 RET 25be&quot; types it no problem in either default font used in my .org files.
 seems a similar issue occurred with this person as well: although I have not messed with its face settings on purpose https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48272/org-mode-ellipsis-arrow-is-not-using-my-defined-encoding-utf-8

                    <span>I am trying to compile emacs directly from the repo (not from a tar release). I checkout master and run:
  ./autogen.sh ./configure make  But I get the following error:  In toplevel form: shadowfile.el:77:1:Error: Recursive load: &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot;, &quot;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp/net/tramp.el&quot; make[2]: *** [Makefile:296: shadowfile.elc] Error 1 make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... make[2]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp&#x27; make[1]: *** [Makefile:319: compile-main] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory &#x27;/tmp/stage/emacs/lisp&#x27; make: *** [Makefile:411: lisp] Error 2  This happens even when I compile from a commit tagged as a release, e.g. emacs-27.1 emacs-27.2. Compiling from a tar release works fine. (tried this on versions 27.1 and 27.2)
 I&#x27;m using Archlinux, kernel 5.12.4-arch1-2
 Note: I am a very new emacs (spacemacs) user and I am not very experienced in the patching/development process in general.

                    <span>The 2-character indentation on plain lists doesn&#x27;t work well for me, it makes it tougher to read the structure of deeply nested lists.
 - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. - Aenean fringilla, neque ut malesuada mollis, elit ex cursus sem, in accumsan justo turpis sed nibh. - Nunc mollis nunc eu faucibus viverra. - Quisque condimentum interdum lorem, vel ultricies arcu suscipit at. - Integer dolor augue, pharetra sit amet augue ac, fringilla blandit leo. Curabitur a consequat purus, sed consequat ligula. - Nam vel blandit sem, ac mattis nisi. Aenean vel consequat ipsum. - Suspendisse sed ipsum porta, tincidunt urna vitae, semper arcu. - Cras vitae mollis augue. - Duis vestibulum at diam eu sollicitudin. 
 Is there a way to get org-mode to display plain list indentation with more depth, similar to what org-indent-indentation-per-leveldoes for headings?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi All,
 ​
 Apologies for the question. I have tried searching about this problem, but posts I found do not seem to be the exact same issue.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/lurdquh8r3b71.png?width&#x3D;733&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a3c5f764e216a873f2473dee877aafb9dec36bbb
 The screenshot above shows that I am unable to use any of my linters from python even though they have been installed in my environment, which I use conda.el to manage.
 When I run M-: (executable-find &quot;flake8&quot;), it actually does show the flake8 executable from the correct anaconda environment. I am thus unsure why flycheck is unable to find any of the executables from my linters. 
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>I am trying to make a package that generates a type specimen for a font. In short:
  
Prompt user for a font family (e.g. from font-family-list)
 Open temp buffer into which I generate strings, in the font, in various sizes
  
I can do this easily enough for ASCII characters by doing
 (insert (propertize &quot;Lorem ipsum&quot; &#x27;face &#x60;(:family ,font))) 
 And this does work for non-ASCII characters under emacs -Q.
 However for my personal config I have customized the default fontset to use various fonts according to charset or script:
 (set-fontset-font t &#x27;han &quot;MyCjkFont&quot;) 
 In the presence of this customization I find that no matter what I do, MyCjkFont is always used for characters in han. I&#x27;ve tried making custom fontsets, playing with faces, etc., but nothing has worked.
 The type specimen should be ephemeral and self-contained, so I don&#x27;t want to modify the default fontset when generating it (doing so would affect all other windows/buffers, and the changes would persist after killing the specimen).
 Is there a way to do this?

                    <span>Hi there, I have practiced Scala in leetcode for very simple problem, merged two sorted list. And try using Scala, Python and Rust. It surprise me that Scala is way slower and consume more memory than Python! 
 runtime and memory usage of various programming language
 At first, I have implemented the recursive (652 ms) and changed to imperative one to squeeze its performance (464 ms). But its performance still lower than python anyway. Below is the code that I wrote in Scala in imperative style. (Python code is written almost exactly the same)
 // class ListNode(_x: Int &#x3D; 0, _next: ListNode &#x3D; null) { // var next: ListNode &#x3D; _next // var x: Int &#x3D; _x // } def mergeTwoLists(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode): ListNode &#x3D; { var ll1 &#x3D; l1 var ll2 &#x3D; l2 var result &#x3D; ListNode(0) var cur_res &#x3D; result while (ll1 !&#x3D; null || ll2 !&#x3D; null) { if (ll1 &#x3D;&#x3D; null) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ll2 ll2 &#x3D; null } else if (ll2 &#x3D;&#x3D; null) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ll1 ll1 &#x3D; null } else if (ll1.x &gt; ll2.x) { cur_res.next &#x3D; ListNode(ll2.x) ll2 &#x3D; ll2.next } else { cur_res.next &#x3D; ListNode(ll1.x) ll1 &#x3D; ll1.next } cur_res &#x3D; cur_res.next } return result.next } 
 What is the cause of this? Or Scala is actually slower than Python?

                    <span>As part of my Tweag fellowship, I developed dingo,
a Python package to analyze metabolic networks. dingo provides three methods
that complement the openCOBRA project. The main
advantage of dingo is the efficient implementation
of new sampling algorithms that generate steady states of metabolic networks.
In this post, I’ll explain what this all means and even discuss how
we can use this tool to discover new COVID-19 treatments.
Also check out the audio interview with Apostolos about dingo on the Compositional podcast!
Metabolic networks and COVID-19

                    <span>Does anyone use a zettelkasten for their day-to-day work? For example, taking notes on meetings and the like?
I&#x27;m curious. In my role I find my reading notes often come in handy because I am asked to articulate a position or make some recommendation on something, but I think it would feel strange to start to have a mass of notes on the internal workings of my employer. I wonder if this is something people do, or if they keep it more for personal projects (or for those spaces where the personal and professional overlap).</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 TL;DR: How to get M-. and M-, to work in geiser / guile the way they work for emacs lisp?
 I hope I chose the right community to ask this. Feel free to tell me if I didn&#x27;t, and suggest where to ask otherwise. I am an aspiring lisp / scheme hacker. One thing that I would really get into is gnu guix, the distro which is powered by the guile programming language. 
 So far, all my attempts to combine emacs and geiser whilst hacking guix have gone suboptimally. The main thing that doesn&#x27;t work for me is the ability to jump to a symbol&#x27;s definition using M-. or M-,. This is what I have used browsing emacs lisp code, and I feel this is instrumental to learning the language and how stuff works when you kinda know the basics, but not more than that.
 Thus, I would love to know how I would have to set guile and geiser up so that I will be able to use that most useful function.
 Maybe I am missing something super obvious here that I have not mentioned. Please, if this is the case, feel free to point me to it!
 Have a good day, fellows!

                    <span>Hi all, just wanted to share a thing I made for creating nicer org ids to link to.
 The good thing about org ids is that they allow linking to headlines even if you move things around (when you split off a headline into a new file, say). The bad thing is the ids are UUIDs meaning they contain no information whatsoever on what they’re actually for. This is annoying when you’re editing a link (IMHO).
 So I made something that creates human readable links. This turns out to be a bit involved, as generating UUIDs is stuck somewhere deep inside another function you really don’t want to mess with (separation of concerns apparently is not a thing in org-id code?).
 What it does is when you store a link ( C-c l) it checks whether there already is an ID property. If there isn’t, it creates a new on…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written something that I wish existed when I was at the beginning of exploring emacs: a full breakdown of how I program in emacs (vue, react, python,etc), how I use org-mode to organize my todos and time tracking, and how I do basic IDE stuff like search and replace, window management, etc in emacs. I&#x27;ve also included installation and configuration instructions for everything I do in emacs. 
 According to my clock-table, this apparently took me 24 hours and 39 minutes to write lol. We&#x27;re in lockdown here in Taiwan so there&#x27;s shit else to do. 
 Anyway here&#x27;s the link
 I don&#x27;t have any kind of ads or tracking on my blog, I don&#x27;t know really what my objective is for maintaining it but I feel a compulsion to do so and it feels productive to write blogposts, so I&#x27;m not going to question it further /shrug

                    <span>I&#x27;m attempting to use tramp to edit files on the raspberry pi, how do I get it to work? I&#x27;m typing C-x C-f &#x27;/ssh:rootUsername@ip:/&#x27;, but the second I type the final slash, emacs freezes until I press C-g. What could I be doing wrong? I should add I&#x27;ve shared ssh keys, which works flawlessly in the terminal.

 Edit: fix was found here: https://blog.karssen.org/2016/03/02/fixing-emacs-tramp-mode-when-using-zsh/

 needed to use it on the local and remote shell (which both use zsh)!

gist
  
I recently made a post about deriving GADTs with DerivingVia and it got me thinking if I could implement generic definitions without so much boilerplate. The standard way of defining such a generic instance with GHC.Generics is to define a type class
 class GBinaryPut f where gput :: f t -&gt; Put 
 with an instance for each of the polynomial functor building blocks
 instance GBinaryPut V1 where gput _ &#x3D; pure () instance GBinaryPut U1 where gput U1 &#x3D; pure () instance (GBinaryPut a, GBinaryPut b) &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (a :*: b) where gput (x :*: y) &#x3D; gput x  gput y instance GBinaryPut a &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (M1 i c a) where gput &#x3D; gput . unM1 instance Binary a &#x3D;&gt; GBinaryPut (K1 i a) where gput &#x3D; put . unK1 
 So I thought if there was a nicer way of writing this. generics-sop alread…</span>

                    <span>Essentially, a friend of mine was like &quot;How do you even read a file in a purely functional language?&quot;
 So I sat down with him and wrote a program that is essentially the cat tool without all the bloat like --help and stuff: take filename in, read the file, print it out. And that program literally takes two lines of Haskell code. It came out so concise without me even trying that I just had to share it with you.
 import System.Environment (getArgs) main &#x3D; getArgs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (readFile . head) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn 
 It&#x27;s actually just one line of useful code if you exclude the import statement. Show me a language that can do it more elegantly! I&#x27;ll wait...

                    <span>Today I was writing some code with newtypes. I was writing code with the whole unwrap-modify-wrap pattern.
 ​
 newtype Foo &#x3D; Foo { unFoo :: Char } myFunc &#x3D; Foo . doSomething . unFoo 
 I had another newtype. Pretty soon I had single lines with multiple wrappings and unwrappings. E.g.:
 newtype Bar &#x3D; Bar { unBar :: String } somePolymorphicFunc :: Int -&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] modify (Bar . somePolymorphicFunc x (unFoo y) . unBar) 
 I didn&#x27;t like this line. Then it hit me: dealing with newtypes was supposed to be a solved problem. Instead I could write:
 ​
 modify (coerce somePolymorphicFunc x y) 
 And it would magically work, right?
 ​
 Wrong. While GHC could tell I wanted to turn somePolymorphicFunc into an Int -&gt; Bar -&gt; Foo -&gt; Foo, it didn&#x27;t know what type to coerce it from. I&#x27;d have to write.

                    <span>As I continue to dig into continuations I wondered if I could add shift and reset to LogicT. The immediate problem I ran into is that LogicT uses a forall r. internally and so even though you can write shift and reset, you can&#x27;t actually use the lambda you get from calling shift.
 So the first thing I did was to change LogicT to expose r:
 newtype LogicT r m a &#x3D; LogicT { unLogicT :: (a -&gt; m r -&gt; m r) -&gt; m r -&gt; m r} 
 Then I quickly copied over a bunch of the definitions in Control.Monad.Logic no problem. I had to generalize the types of course to add r but it was trivial to do. There&#x27;s a few things I haven&#x27;t converted yet like msplit, but I don&#x27;t expect to run into any issues.
 I ended up with these shift/reset operators:
 resetT :: MonadFail m &#x3D;&gt; LogicT r m r -&gt; LogicT r&#x27; m r resetT &#x3D; lif…</span>

                    <span>Heya all.
 I have a long history as a software developer, both in commercial environments and in academic research labs (mostly C, Scheme/LISP, Python, some Java). Back in 2013 I got into Spark and Scala working for a startup and kind of burned out by 2015. I decided to try new things and bought a farm and spent the last 5-6 years growing food, working outside etc. However, I find myself wanting to go back and at least pick up contracts/gigs to make some additional income, invest more into my retirement etc.
 It has been 6 years since I looked at Scala and I know things have changed since.
 A few questions: 1) what is the easiest/best way to get back in the game and refresh/catch up on everything that happened in the language? and 2) will anyone even consider me after a multi-year unrelated gap in my resume? When I &quot;retired&quot;, I was at the senior level but obviously do not expect to get back at that level (no ego here). What is the best way to approach this - where do I look, how do I approach potential employers?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I just started doing journals after learning Emacs and Org for a week, and I&#x27;ve settled on a style that works for me as someone with ADHD. I&#x27;d like to be able to start a new weekly journal with the same style as I&#x27;ve made myself, just to save some work and keep things consistent. I know I&#x27;d have to edit my .emacs for this, and the syntax mostly makes sense to me, but I have no idea where to start. Any help is appreciated, thank you!
 The template I&#x27;d like to set, with the dates automatically set for the week each time:

 Sometimes when I want to reply to an email in mu4e, the whole Emacs freezes and I need to kill it. I don&#x27;t know what triggers it but it is 100% reproducible on certain emails. For the rest, everything works fine.
 Do you have some suggestions, please?

                    <span>I used to use neotree, and recently switched to treemacs. I like treemacs find. It seems to be the new thing people are using. Spacemacs seems to have shifted to it by default. BUT there&#x27;s one big flaw IMHO: With neotree, the file tree for the project that I was currently in appeared; with treemacs, a whole set of projects appear other than the one that I am working in. This adds extra noise and in some cases is just inconvenient because I have to worry about adding/removing projects.
 Is there any way to get treemacs to behave a bit more like neotree?

                    <span>Hello! I often create keyboard macros to (for example) run capitalize-region over org/outline headings, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to generalise this class of tasks. 2 possible solutions might be:
 (1.) A (with-visible-region ...) macro, which &quot;maps&quot; its body over visible portions of the current region.
 Or (2.) A &quot;Narrow to visible portion(s) of region&quot; - I have no idea if narrowed buffers can show multiple subsets of a buffer, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve seen some occur-like modes do this and keep the selections editable.
 I&#x27;d prefer the first solution, and it&#x27;s probably easy to implement, but thought I&#x27;d ask about prior art first :) always good to learn new tricks.

                    <span>Hello!
 I am trying to use dap-mode for debugging c/cpp/rust. I cannot find any way to break on abort.
 It should be possible to add a breakpoint at abort() but I cannot figure out how to add this breakpoint without going to the stdlib.h file and adding the breakpoint there.
 My config for dap-mode
 ;; Debug Adapter Protocol through dap-mode (use-package dap-mode :ensure t :config ;; On a new system need to call &#x60;dap-gdb-lldb-setup&#x60; to setup the ;; vscode extension automagically (require &#x27;dap-gdb-lldb) ;; Bind &#x60;C-c l d&#x60; to &#x60;dap-hydra&#x60; for easy access (general-define-key :keymaps &#x27;lsp-mode-map :prefix lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;d&quot; &#x27;(dap-hydra t :wk &quot;debugger&quot;))) 
 Thanks in advance :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been committing myself to use org mode more. One thing I&#x27;d like to do is integrate diagrams for some of the systems I&#x27;m responsible for and for personal coding projects. 
 I&#x27;ve been considering using LucidChart as the diagram editor, but I&#x27;m open to other suggestions as well. 
 Overall, how do you render both PNGs and asci-text style diagrams in org mode blocks and Github READMEs?

                    <span>I&#x27;m storing my tags files in the .git folder for each Git repository, using a variant of this method, with the tags file at the path .git/etags. I would like Emacs to automatically locate and use the tags file, and it should be local to the buffer, because I will probably have files from different repositories open at once.
 This is what I came up with:
 (add-hook &#x27;find-file-hook (lambda () (let* ((tagspath &quot;.git/etags&quot;) (git-root (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name) tagspath))) (if git-root (visit-tags-table (expand-file-name tagspath git-root) 1))))) 
 I&#x27;m very new to Emacs (started using it around a week ago), so I figured there must be a better way to do this. Any ideas/suggestions?

                    <span>Hi! This post is mostly to share my joy from making something cool and useful for myself. I started with emacs about a year ago, and have been kinda stuck in a beginner state since then. I&#x27;m a math teacher, not a programmer, and emacs is a little side hobby that I haven&#x27;t spent enough time really learning, in order to reap the benefits of being able to make it do whatever I want. But this last week I put in some time, and I learned a lot, and now I have a cool thing, and I feel like I&#x27;m finally on the road to emacs wizardry.
 Here&#x27;s the problem I want to solve: I have a lot of students, and there are a ton of things I want to remember about each one of them. For example, Bobbo has missed a lot of class the last few weeks, he told me his mom is sick, and I gave him an extension for an assig…</span>

 My app connects to RabbitMQ, and then waits to keep the connection running. Is there a way to wait, that is not dependent on the stdin?

                    <span>I have often wished that I could subscribe to RSS feeds that notify me when new books are published about a certain topic or by a certain author. I recently implemented the idea in the article system of my personal website and created an index of Haskell books.
 https://www.extrema.is/articles/haskell-books
 The index provides a simple UI for browsing by tag, and each book page has basic information and links. By subscribing to the following RSS feed, you get a notification when a new book is added to the index.
 https://www.extrema.is/articles/tag/index:haskell-books.rss
 This is a humble first implementation, but I am posting here in case others find it useful.

 I&#x27;d like to be able to paste a conversation from Slack into an Org document and have it include the formatting from Slack. At a minimum, I&#x27;d like links to work, but it&#x27;d be great if all of the text formatting pasted properly into Org as well.
 Does anyone know of a solution for this?

                    <span>Hi, sorry for the noob question. I have a document with a numbered list like this: 
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/zoa6kdgausa71.png?width&#x3D;1872&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;1580037bf5221e979af64f7a9f26eafdb7bafa49
 As you can see on the left, its numbered correctly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). but on the latex doc its (1, 1, 1, 1), is there a way to have the proper numbering while exporting?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m struggling with configuration of metals for emacs on my new laptop with ubuntu that I use at work. I&#x27;ve installed metals via coursier, but when I open a Scala project and use some lsp-metals command Emacs says it&#x27;s not a metals workspace. I use the same emacs config I use on my private Arch PC where everything works fine. Got any thoughts what might be a problem?

                    <span>I am a newbie in Machine Learning Engineer field from Thailand and only have to deal with python and its machine learning package in my profession like pyspark and sk-learn. I would like to expand my skill set by doing side project on the AIoT fields (raspberry pi, backend and frontend) with another programming language which have higher performance.
 At first, I think Rust is the interesting choice as raspberry pi has limited resources and very fun to code.
 But, I am more interested in the new announced Scala 3 since it is the language being used in many of the data science fields. It has Scala.js which can be implemented on frontend. And it is very fun to code in functional style.
 However, in Thailand, the Scala jobs is nearly non-existent.
  
But what about Scala popularity in other countries?
 Any thought on the Scala 3 full stack?
 If Scala is not popular, I would like to hear the reason too.
 And what about Rust popularity in other countries?
  
Thanks in advance for your opinion everyone!

 For those who haven&#x27;t used it yet, ScalablyTyped is a converter that provides an SBT plugin to convert typescript definition to usable ScalaJS types. It is definitely one of the most important projects to the ScalaJS ecosystem, and looks to me as if it&#x27;s maintained by a single person right now. 
 Hopefully this can get some more awareness out for this awesome project and people can drop some thanks toward the author (who I am not).

                    <span>Hello Everyone. I&#x27;m using Emacs everywhere - on my linux laptop and work mac laptop, and whenever I get a chance I&#x27;ll use my large monitor for better screen real estate. I&#x27;m determined to use one init.el file, rather than maintaining several.
 I find I need to adjust the default font anytime I switch machines or screen sizes. On the Mac, I want Emacs to use Menlo, but on Linux I want FiraCode. When I&#x27;m not plugged into the monitor, I want size 11, but I need it the font at size 14 on large resolutions (i.e., greater than 1600).
 I&#x27;m just starting to learn elisp, so I get into trouble pretty quickly. I was hoping to craft something like the following, but also taking into account (string-equal system-type &quot;darwin&quot;). and swapping FiraCode for Menlo in that situation.
 ;; set the font size based on resolution (if (&gt; (x-display-pixel-width) 1600) (add-to-list &#x27;initial-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-11&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(font . &quot;Fira Code-14&quot;))) 
 Then, it occurred to me that I&#x27;m not unique in my situation, and I should just ask if anyone else has Elisp that handles this situation. Will you Emacs wizards share Elisp where you handle this sort of thing?
 In the meantime, I&#x27;m off to find a good Elisp tutorial so I won&#x27;t need to ask for this kind of help in the future. Much appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all, is there a variable or config I can set in emacs-dashboard that will use relative file paths? Right now I have both a windows and a linux emacs I&#x27;m trying to learn/use org-mode for and the Windows recentf file that&#x27;s storing the recent files to display uses absolute paths and it&#x27;s linked via a pcloud directory so it ruins the recents on my linux homedirectoy mirror.

 evil mode
 ​
 I also want to make something new for emacs.
 But i dont know how to start and not only start,
 I dont know how to make these projects production based. 
 I&#x27;m doing solely for community purpose to like emacs.
 I need your help.
 ​
 ​
 If you have made any emacs popular packages,
 would you please give me your story how you made it? 
 What resources did you followed to master it?
 Please provide a detail, which sites did you gone , which did you followed , 
 while learning to make packages and learn.
 ​
 ​
 I&#x27;m asking this because when i learn books on emacs, I would only know basic instead of making some project based practical extension, I will be stuck like i&#x27; here learning python and not making anything. 
 ​
 PLEASE HELP

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;m pretty new to Haskell itself and its development ecosystem. I&#x27;m trying to setup a Haskell Language Server for Neovim 0.5 (with native LSP support). Previously I was using CoC and HLS that I installed via ghcup and it worked just fine. Now with new version of Neovim I stopped using CoC and trying to make HLS work with native LSP. I have no idea on how to make my already installed HLS work together with native LSP, so I tried to install HLS via lspinstall plugin, but I always get the same error:
 ghcide compiled against GHC 8.10.5 but currently using 8.10.4 This is unsupported, ghcide must be compiled with the same GHC version as the project.
 I checked a version of &#x60;ghc&#x60; (with ghc -v) on my machine the output is:
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.5
 I also tried to create a new project with stack new ... to check if that issue persists there and it does.
 Does anybody have similar issues?
 If anybody could share his way of configuring Neovim LSP + HLS that would be great!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Played around with a nice TH tutorial posted here not a long ago.
 I&#x27;ve just copy-pasted relevant code snippets from the article - definitions for relevant generateTupleBoilerplate, generateTupleClass and generateTupleInstance - here is the source. Then in the main module used it for generating 62(current limit) type classes for tuples and their instances - source.
 My question: is that normal for such simple program GHC consumes really huge memory ~1.2 GiB at compilation, while full web-application project based on Servant takes about 400 MiB at max? Talking about RSS memory footprint, tested with GHC 9.0.1 . Either loading in ghci REPL or compiling with ghc -O makes no difference.
 Is this a known issue with TH extension or template-haskell package &amp; its dependencies?

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to build a Set with do-notation, ala []
 bars :: Set Bar basz :: Set Baz foos :: Set Foo foos &#x3D; do bar  (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b fmap &#x3D; Set.map return &#x3D; Set.singleton ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; mf &#x3D; Set.unions $ Set.map mf ma 
 And this makes everything work! Very cool, QualifiedDo doing QualifiedDo things. However, it&#x27;s clear that foo doesn&#x27;t require the full power of a monad. ApplicativeDo, here we come. Turn it on, implement some bindings
 pure &#x3D; Set.singleton ma  mb &#x3D; ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \f -&gt; Set.map f mb 
 and....bummer
 • Could not deduce (Ord (Baz -&gt; Foo)) arising from a do statement (maybe you haven&#x27;t applied a function to enough arguments?) 
 which unfortunately makes total sense. ApplicativeDo desugars into
 foos &#x3D; (\bar baz -&gt; mkFoo bar baz)  bars  bazs 
 which is trying to use fmap to make an intermediate Set (Baz -&gt; Foo). However, I cannot see a theoretical reason this could not desugar into this instead
 foos &#x3D; liftA2 mkFoo bars bazs 
 given a binding
 liftA2 :: Ord c&#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set b -&gt; Set c liftA2 f as bs &#x3D; Set.map (uncurry f) (Set.cartesianProduct as bs) 
 So it seems like what I want to do is not unsound, but is not possible given how ApplicativeDo works. Am I wrong? If I am, what can I do? If not, has this limitation of ApplicativeDo been discussed anywhere else? Thanks!

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say we have a custom object that uses BlazeClientBuilder. I want to create a Resource out of that custom type, meanwhile properly acquiring and releasing BlazeClientBuilder. How can I do that? I know BlazeClientBuilder has its own Resource implementation, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an access to the respective phases.

                    <span>Reading Christian Tietze&#x27;s and Sascha Fast&#x27;s blog posts on the importance of tracking inspired me to track how many Zettels I create.
I figured that keeping a list of Zettels created daily would be useless without a workflow to integrate it in. So, I watched Brian Crain&#x27;s presentation on optimizing productivity, which was cited in one of the blog posts from the Zettelkasten blog. Also, I read this article from the Quantified Self website that I found along the way.
I decided that I want to do something similar to Brian Crain. From tracking how many pomodori he completed, he gained the ability to achieve two things: notice a standard for his good days/weeks/months/quarters/years, and compare how well he did with how well he is doing. I want to achieve the same from tracking how many Zettels I create.
From looking at his setup, I&#x27;d have to track the following:
Total from a year
Total from the first to the fourth quarters
Monthly average
Weekly average
Number of weeks in which I get my weekly average or above it
Daily average
Number of days in which I get my daily average or above it
He tracked more, but this is all I could understand from his presentation and slides.
My problem is setting up an user interface to manage all of this in a way that is simple and allows me to get every item easily. Brian Crain didn&#x27;t talk much about his setup. Also, I have zero knowledge in using spreadsheets. So the question is: How do I achieve what I want to accomplish?
Really appreciate any help you can give me.</span>

 The pages don&#x27;t seem to have A title tags. Could that be the reason why the suspended tabs loose the titles?

 Unicode CJK text (top) converted to PS file (bottom)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for CJK Unicode text. Now you can print CJK Unicode text using TrueType fonts (Google&#x27;s Noto Serif CJK font in the image) .
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>org-attach, for some reason, splits the ID into two parts before creating the path for your attachments:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no (org-attach-dir-from-id &quot;748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84&quot;) #+end_src #+RESULTS: : /home/user/org/.attach/74/8ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Instead of something like this:
 /home/user/org/.attach/748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84 
 Is this the standard behavior or am I experiencing a bug? If this is the standard behavior, is there a reason behind it?
 EDIT:
 I found the function responsible for it and it seems intentional:
 (defun org-attach-id-uuid-folder-format (id) &quot;Translate an UUID ID into a folder-path. Default format for how Org translates ID properties to a path for attachments. Useful if ID is generated with UUID.&quot; (format &quot;%s/%s&quot; (substring id 0 2) (substring id 2))) 
 But I&#x27;m still not sure why it is designed this way. Is there a special meaning to the first 2 characters of a UUID?

 When I started this journey I did not find much material on this topic so this is my reference guide after 1 month of experiments. The coolest part is obviously running emacs on it and connecting it with UNIX tooling.

                    <span>I am switching to Programmer&#x27;s Dvorak and don&#x27;t yet have an ortholinear keyboard. The biggest pain point so far is that C-x is really annoying to reach, since it&#x27;s what was C-b on QWERTY. This means that many of my most frequent commands, such as C-x C-s, are a real stretch (QWERTY C-b C-;). How have any of the esteemed Dvorak emacsers reading this made peace with these C-x problems?

                    <span>Is there a function in lsp-mode, or ccls directly to find the compilation command associated with the file (if any) in the current buffer? If not, would another package (rtags, ede-compdb, irony-cdb) help query the compilation database without needing to use the rest of the package? The main use case is to plug it into other tools such as rmsbolt and templight that &quot;compile&quot; code to provide additional information.
 ccls-specific: Can the ccls cache for the current project be queried to obtain a list of all the files currently cached/indexed? If so, can it provide the compilation command associated with each of those files? This would help tremendously with header files in C++ or C.

                    <span>Hi all,
 After reading a lot of posts here and on other place in www I started using Caps and Return long-press as Ctrl. It&#x27;s really nice to have two Ctrl on my Mac without disrupting Caps and Return key. I am using Karabiner BTW to do it.
 This creates a new problem for me where if I press Ctrl with my pinky then it is really awkward to press save and close shortcuts (C-x C-s or C-x C-c). When Ctrl was in corner it was natural to use index and middle finger for those shortcuts but with Caps as Ctrl it feels a bit of stretch to use middle finger for s and index finger for x. That loweing the finger is also not very comfortable.
 Where am I going wrong with my finger placement?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a library for dealing with times and dates far in the past ~1200-1650 A.D.
 I&#x27;m familiar with time and hodatime, but they&#x27;re not really what I&#x27;m looking for.
 I&#x27;d like support for inputting/outputting Julian calendar and Muslim calendar dates, but that&#x27;s not strictly speaking necessary.

                    <span>Over the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve been tinkering with an idea for a very simple library to facilitate background polling that I would like to use in one of my personal projects. This is the first library that I&#x27;m considering uploading to Hackage. Would greatly appreciate any feedback!

                    <span>I&#x27;m a new comer to PureScript, Haskell and other functional programming languages.
 I&#x27;m reading TaPL and want to implement a parser for the untyped lambda calculus in Part I.
 I want to parse the source code with its context which records the names of variables. In Parsec, the parser library in Haskell, there is a parameter u standing for the user-defined state type. On the other hand, there is no such parameter in Parser in purescript-parsing.
 Should I rewrite a parser library with states, or is there a good method to join states with parsers?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve just created two pairs of video/blog post that show you how you can prove the absence of an implicit/given instance at compile time.
 First pair in Scala 3 with the NotGiven feature: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HQojyuZK-Uo with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-givens/
 And the second pair in Scala 2 (and early versions of Scala 3.x with implicits), which is much more general (and more dangerous): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;m9LH0hvahcQ with the written form: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/anti-implicits/

                    <span>Crazy question, but is there any way I can pipe the output from ansi-term directly into org mode to then format it on the fly into a table?
 I ask this because I often have to look at logs for work, and though &#x27;CSV-Mode&#x27; has helped for some logs, its not that great on an actual client&#x27;s backend system (CentOS).
 Would love to hear some thoughts on this because so far I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;Line-Mode&#x27; in ansi-term to just copy and paste, make tables on the fly with &#x27;C-c |&#x27; but thought maybe this could be done a bit easier and more direct INSIDE my org mode doc notes.
 ​
 Thanks!

                    <span>When I open a remote shell and try to type anything, there is a super long pause (10-15 sec) before autocomplete shows up. I tried disabling company-shell and company, and things return to normal when both are disabled.
 What&#x27;s going on that&#x27;s making it so slow?

                    <span>I use mu4e with Outlook email for work, and was informed that we would be moving mandatorily to Duo two-factor authentication.
 Apparently Duo is incompatible with IMAP, so I am considering my options.
 I wanted to check whether anyone has crossed this hurdle successfully and has any advice---thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a switch back to linux after quite a long time away (from before switching to emacs).
 Most stuff just worked but I have a few issues. Specifically right now the thing that is bugging me is different behavior for end-of-buffer. 
 On Mac OS I can jump to the end (or beginning) of a buffer with no issue. On linux the command works and appears to be the same (looked up via C-h k) but in addition to the jump it defines a region in the process. 
 It&#x27;s giving me the behavior that&#x27;s I&#x27;d get on my old machine if I set the mark then jumped. 
 If there&#x27;s a setting somewhere I&#x27;m not seeing it... any ideas?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve found all-the-icons-install-fonts to be ineffective under MacOS 11.2.3.
 I see emacs successfully installing font files under home and running fc-cache:
 $ ls -al ~/Library/Fonts/ ... -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 44732 Jul 8 21:06 all-the-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 489672 Jul 8 21:06 file-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 152796 Jul 8 21:06 fontawesome.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 128180 Jul 8 21:06 material-design-icons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 52544 Jul 8 21:06 octicons.ttf -rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff 99564 Jul 8 21:06 weathericons.ttf 
 However, at runtime, those fonts are not picked up and garbled international characters are shown instead of the icons.
 The solution I found was to forcefully copy all these ttf files into /Library/Fonts(i.e., the system-wide font directory).
 Once in the system wide Fonts directory, emacs successfully picks up fonts with no troubles.
 Please advise if you know a cleaner solution.

                    <span>I wonder what happened to abo-abo, the author of ivy and swiper.
 Since 2015 he made at least one contribution on github, but since beginning of June there seems to be no activity. While this is usual for some users like me, it looks unusual for Oleh.
 I hope he is doing well.

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping this is a simple started project b/c my ELisp is a bit basic. If I&#x27;m biting off more than I can chew, please let me know. I&#x27;ve written a linear algebra library in Elisp so from a straight coding point of view I&#x27;m okay, but I&#x27;m not very verse in how to interact with the Emacs ecosystem.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is to write simplified version of the ob-clojure. One that doesn&#x27;t depend on running CIDER. The current integration with CIDER seems to be a legacy requirement from when Clojure didn&#x27;t come with a REPL.
 I&#x27;m currently use Octave in a literate mode and it&#x27;s pretty great. I can make plots in-line to my notes and then export it all to HTML. ex: https://geokon-gh.github.io/rocks/orbital.html . With Clojure the equivalent is a bit problematic b/c the core language is very bare so you need to use libraries and this is all managed typically through a deps.edn central config file (or in ob-clojure&#x27;s case, lein). So that suddenly is not very REPL-y and orthogonal to the literal workflow.
 Fortunately this seems to be something you can get around now a days withadd-lib https://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/
 The idea would be to launch an inferior clj process with something like
 clj -Sdeps &quot;{:deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:mvn/version \&quot;0.11.935\&quot;}}}&quot; 
 Then you can in a literate way, add libraries on the fly and do the normal literate workflow like in Octave.
 I found a template for how to write a new language support https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el
 It seems relatively straightforward - but I&#x27;m unclear on how to launch a clj inferior mode and pipe things in/out of it. Is there some canonical way to do that? (I&#x27;m okay if this only works on Linux)
 Any just general tips and suggestions would be welcome :) and if this is all a bit more complicated than I make it out to be, please let me know. I don&#x27;t want to have to sink a month into this

                    <span>Howdy all!
 I wrote a WAV editor (GUI application) in Haskell which targets long-form narration audio. I&#x27;m releasing a public beta for it and thought I&#x27;d share here.
 It weighs in at ~9kloc and uses the SDL2 gaming lib for graphics and audio playback. The architecture uses a hybrid of OOP and functional techniques: the Model-View-Presenter pattern with FRP (via netwire) driving the UI interactivity.
 The codebase isn&#x27;t super polished and I&#x27;ve yet to write tests, so there&#x27;s bound to be cruft, but any feedback would be appreciated -- do let me know if I did anything exceedingly stupid (besides not writing tests yet, that is)!
 Resources:
  
osabe.app (consumer site)
 dev blog
 code repo
 @osabe_app on Twitter for release announcements, etc.
 @paul_schnapp on Twitter for dev discussion
  
There are a few things I could use some help with if anyone has the time and expertise:
  
There appears to be a slow memory leak with unevaluated thunks that I can&#x27;t nail down (I think somewhere in the Presenter, though possibly the Model)
 I&#x27;m having trouble nicely packaging the app with all the libs it needs on Mac

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on the effectful library and I&#x27;ve encountered that function of such shape is helpful for lifting monadic actions where m r shows in invariant position (e.g. like the unmask callback within mask).
 Hoogle search returns no results.
 The exact signature looks like this:
 withLiftH :: IOE :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; ((forall a b localEs. (IO a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; Eff localEs a -&gt; Eff localEs b) -&gt; Eff es r) -&gt; Eff es r 
 withLiftH is a working name, but perhaps there is a better name for this function?
 EDIT: Never mind, I realized this function is too permissive and will subtly break when misused with multiple threads (e.g. because you can happily use it to lift forkIO) considering the internal representation of Eff. My previous idea was a bit more complicated, but it&#x27;ll work reliably.
 I thought I could make the API a bit nicer, but this just won&#x27;t do.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s cut to the chase, I have been working with Javascript, Python and recently elixir. I found Elixir incredibly fun, easy to understand and much less verbose than using javascript. Recently I found watched escape from the ivory tower on the Haskell website and was more than intrigued. My concern is that, given that I only have limited time to dedicate to studying after work, should I work focus on Haskell or Elixir. Personally I would love to learn Haskell, but I want to make sure I learn something I will use, otherwise I won&#x27;t improve at it.

                    <span>Hello org-community,
 does anyone have a workaround/fix for the following issue:
 When exporting a document via the latex-backend footnotes inside of verse-blocks are not resolved correctly:
 #+begin_verse lorem ipsum dolor sit amet[fn::This is a footnote] #+end_verse 
 results in the .tex file as
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext[]{This is a footnote} 
 This has the irritating result that in the pdf the footnote is numbered with whatever  is given by the automatic export.
 The expected result would be (at least I think so)
 \begin{verse} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\footnotemark \end{verse} \footnotetext{This is a footnote} 
 At the moment I&#x27;m stuck with deleting every [] argument – which works, but is obviously tedious.
 About the document: It is written in a report/book class, so numbering starts anew, when a new chapter is begun. otherwise it probably would stay unnoticed.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

 P.S.: User of Doom-emacs. But that shouldn&#x27;t matter.

                    <span>Greetings fellow orgonians,
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out if it&#x27;s possible to use org mode to represent repeating calendar events. In typical calendars, repeating events can be specified with rrules. However, while I see that org mode has repeaters, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to do several things that I can do with rrules.
 Examples:
 (1) repeat on the last day of every month
 (2) repeat on every 1st and 15th day of every month
 (3) repeat every Mon, Wed, Fri
 ​
 Is it possible to encode these repeat patterns in org mode? If so, how?
 If not, is there some extension package which enriches org mode with more sophisticated datetime patterns?
 Thanks in advance for any info you can offer!

                    <span>My personal keybindings, installed at Emacs start-up as a global minor mode, are numerous and a disorganized mess. That Time Has Come to refactor while preserving the muscle memory of my existing bindings. 
 I&#x27;m aware of bind-key.el and general.el. Bind-key is sweet, especially for the tight integration with use-package, but I think I need something with a bit more beef, like general.el, not least for its concept of layers, something I crudely reinvented in my own system. 
 I&#x27;m also considering -- seriously! -- the native menu system in Emacs. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so disliked. It&#x27;s essentially a visual leader-key framework built rather elegantly from keymaps. No need for which-key.el or transient.el for prompting and discoverability. You can even use it with a mouse of course. I figure that I can&#x27;t go wrong sticking with a framework already built into Emacs.
 An essential requirement for me: I code in Org Babel. I already structure my keybinding code with Org outlines and tagging to make it all easily navigable. This approach I need to keep. 
 Am I overlooking any packages? I&#x27;m facing a year of work. Naturally I must start off right. BTW, I&#x27;ve never used Vim and I am not interested in going down the pure Evil route as in Spacemacs, super-impressive though it is. Kudos to the Spacemacs folks, who have won so many converts to Emacs just as Magit and Org have. 
 I put my fate into the hands of r/emacs.

                    <span>I just concluded the first phase of work on a voice-control mode, serenade-mode. There&#x27;s not yet a demo video, but you can check out Serenade&#x27;s homepage to see what Serenade is capable of, it&#x27;s pretty impressive stuff. I&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback/code review on this since it&#x27;s my first mode, before I begin a Spacemacs layer that will extend it (I&#x27;m a Spacemacs/evil user, and outside that it hasn&#x27;t really been tested). Also, if anybody has suggestions or wants to contribute, that would be great!

                    <span>I use gnus, and I&#x27;ve been learning about org-capture. I like what I&#x27;ve seen several people do, which is to create a capture template for responding to emails. Since this will only ever be invoked from a buffer where you are viewing an email, the template can include clever things, like a link to the email you want to reply to. There is a good example here.
 It seems to me the obvious thing to do is to make this whole process as seamless as possible, and just make the TODO entry a link to a response---the template should include an org link which, when activated, opens a reply message to the original message, just as if I had pressed r in gnus.
 The &#x27;just as if...&#x27; is the tricky bit. I make extensive use of posting styles, and keep all of my email config in gnus.el, which is only initialised when gnus is loaded. I want all this to apply properly when I follow the link, even if I don&#x27;t happen to have opened gnus directly yet in that session (obviously, the link will still have to trigger loading gnus.el). I think this rules out a simply mailto link.
 Even if it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not sure if mailto links can do responses. Standard responses, as written in gnus and pretty much everything else, are generated from the original email (to the original sender, subject should be Re: original subject and so on).
 I know that org links can include arbitrary elisp. Perhaps the answer is a function (a preexisting one, or a wrapper around such), and clever use of some of the org capture expandos?
 How might I do this? Any ideas would be great. TIA!

                    <span>I created a script to allow me to run multiple Emacsen on Mac. I basically create another folder in/Applications like Emacs1.app and link most things in from Emacs.app. I use a different icon for each Emacs so I can tell them apart. I like this arrangement because I can have only related files open in each Emacs or have different searches or find buffers in different Emacs apps. This of course can’t use emacsclient so you don’t get any boost starting Emacs but I don’t care since I leave them running for days or weeks. If anybody wants this script I can share it. I got the different icons from the Homebrew Emacs Plus project. If everyone thinks this is a stupid idea forget I said anything.

                    <span>buttondown.email is a newsletter service and is basically a better substack, there is some glitchyness (I think its only 1 dude working on it) but it is pretty great from my experience. However it only supports markdown. Thankfully it has a API (unlike substack) and Ive developed a solution that allows you to post any org-mode file you have.
 first make and save this python script I made (and probably put it into your PATH) and make it executable (chmod u+x org-buttondown.py) and install necessary dependencies (python-frontmatter and pandoc)

                    <span>Hello all,
 I have run across a number laborious text editing operations recently that I thought could be solved elegantly with map and reduce concepts from functional programming. Does something like this already exist or is there a better way than what I am thinking?
 Task 1: 
 I like to write / edit in outline form - one bullet per sentence. A common task is to take a specific paragraph of text and split it by sentence into a bulleted list. 
 Task 2: 
 Conversely, the oposite task is to take a bulleted list at certain indentation level and collapse it back to a paragraph. 
 Task 3: 
 Consider that you want to extract all URLs from a buffer and concatenate them into list (one url per line)
 ​
 It occurs to me that the first two tasks could be solved efficiently if there was a flexible ma…</span>

                    <span>Hey Everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs for 2 months now, like it a lot. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the best way of navigating around, and this question is very vague. 
 I mainly do embedded linux work. And it kind of seems to me like there are two approaches to navigating to files as you work on a project. 
 The first approach is that you open a terminal, and move around with cd. When you find a file you want to edit you open up emacs for that particular file, then close emacs when you are done editing. 
 The the second approach is that you just open emacs, and navigate using dired or going to recently opened buffers, never closing emacs. I might also have a terminal open to try running the code.
 It seems to me that emacs lends itself more to the second approach, and perhaps vim is more suited for the first? No idea if that is true, but I&#x27;ve kind of settled into the second approach. I also have just been using the emacs GUI which I also imagine also lends itself to the second approach. 
 I&#x27;m curious how other people have their workflow setup. Anyone else run emacs in a GUI along side a terminal, or is that just weird? 
 Thanks, 
 -Hunter

                    <span>I wrote a recursive function that conceptually ought to work even though there&#x27;s no explicit base case. Specifically, successive elements of a finite data structure depend on (what should be) prior elements. 
 It type-checks and compiles, but when I try to run it in GHCI, it hangs for ~10s, throws a *** Exception: stack overflow, and then several seconds later GHCI is killed.
 There are a lot of things that could be undermining my assumptions.
 I understand that debugging these kinds of things is difficult in Haskell (for exactly the reasons good recursion is easy to do); I&#x27;m only on my first day with this problem. Are there normal strategies or tools for homing in on the cause?

 pSelect :: Integral a &#x3D;&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pSelect &#x3D; BSelect  fromIntegral  natural
 pAnd :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pAnd prsr &#x3D; BAnd  prsr sepBy1 (symbol &quot;&amp;&quot;)
 pOr :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pOr prsr &#x3D; BOr  prsr sepBy1 (symbol &quot;|&quot;)
 pNot :: Parser (BoolExp a) -&gt; Parser (BoolExp a) pNot prsr &#x3D; BNot  ((symbol &quot;!&quot;) *&gt; prsr)

 I think the grammar I am trying to go for is self explanatory based on the code. However, this goes into a loop for most expressions, even parse pBool &quot;&quot; &quot;! 12&quot;. How can I fix this?

                    <span>Using kind-generics /u/Syrak was able to implement a generic implementation of TestEquality which can be used to derive instances for GADTs. It is not commonly known that this is even possible.
 This is what the TestEquality typeclass looks like, witnessing the equality of arguments:
 type TestEquality :: (k -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint class TestEquality f where testEquality :: f a -&gt; f b -&gt; Maybe (a :~: b) 
 By giving a kind-generic instance to Generically1 we are able to derive TestEquality A via Generically1 A, assuming GenericK Wit and GenericK SOrdering instances!

 How can I use newtype to wrap a existed data type in haskell? 
 As I read on https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns#evidence, they can wrap sort function to SortedList. They are using newtype and where can they use smart constructors? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I find imenu very helpful for quickly jumping back and forth between defuns in buffers containing lots of function definitions. However, when this command is invoked in an org-mode buffer, the relevant units cease to be defuns and become org headings instead. This makes sense in most cases, but when the org buffer is visiting a literate configuration file, it would be nice if imenu behaved as it normally does in programming modes. Example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; * Section one
 +begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-one () &quot;This is not a useful function.&quot;)
 +end_src
  
Section two
  
+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
 (defun function-two () &quot;This is not a useful function, either.&quot;)
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When invoked here, I would like imenu to let me choose between function-one and function-two rather than between * Section one and * Section two.
 Is there a way to modify imenu so that it behaves as I&#x27;m describing? Alternatively, is there a similar command or package that provides this sort of functionality?

                    <span>Good day everyone!
 I&#x27;ve always been using scalamock with scalatest only, but now I&#x27;d like to optimize my tests by rewriting long running sequential scalatest suites to uTest. I&#x27;m using default scalatest MockFactory for my suite. I know that it&#x27;s supposed to work with scalatest only and I&#x27;ve seen in scalamock guide that you can implement your own MockFactoryBase and it should somehow work, but I didn&#x27;t really work for me(maybe I just understood guid wrong). 
 I create separate instance of the mock in every test context
 test(&quot;blah blah&quot;) {val myMock &#x3D; mock[TraitToMock] ...}
 Also my project is written using cats-effect, so I&#x27;m running tests also with it&#x27;s IO 
 And in process I faced multiple issues such as:
 java.util.ConcurrentModificationException: mutation occurred during iteration
 It seems it&#x27;s because in UnorderedHandler(which is used in my tests) handle method they&#x27;re using synchronization, but in parent Handler class operations with handlers are not synchronized.
 https://preview.redd.it/7sflfd9ud0a71.png?width&#x3D;1448&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;8eae336304b348946886066c1214c950229c0b71
 https://preview.redd.it/0nglptufe0a71.png?width&#x3D;1334&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;0db3228a4f760d921e495a122ef8c6350364d995
 Wrapping this methods in synchronization helps and tests don&#x27;t fail. But it seems like this fix is not the best solution.
 If I&#x27;m not getting exception listed above, I get like intersection of mock contexts, mocks handle each other expectations. Something like that
 https://preview.redd.it/8wsgaq0ai0a71.png?width&#x3D;3426&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;16b8b9df369e699b5aac7679518fab8cd3b2cc36
 So maybe someone knows how to make scalamock work with utest properly? Maybe I missed something important or overcomplicate things and much easier solution exists? 
 Thanks in advance!

 Any recruiters that are asking for Scala developers need some experience in Scala. So please help me understand how i can grow in the FP area , so that i can make a move?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am not a full-time developer/coder. But I have been coding for the last ~17 years.
 I have mainly used java. For almost a decade I did not even use a build tool other than ANT and used Netbeans. Then I shifted to maven.
 Now I want to shift to Scala 3. That requires changing the build tool also.
 I don&#x27;t have a problem when it comes to Scala. Somehow I am not still comfortable with the build tool. I feel I would prefer either mill or Maven, over SBT. Mill because it is said to be faster than SBT and seems more powerful. Maven because it seems to provide the maximum support amongst all build tools in the JVM ecosystem. For example, the Gluonvm plugin works fine on maven, the Gradle plugin is still a mess, and I am not even sure about the status of this in SBT or mill.
 Q1) Do you think it is good to use maven to work with Scala while I captch up and become more familiar with the scala ecosystem. Is it even possible? Workable? Sane?
 My requirements are simple - simple maven projects, quarkus, javafx, gluovm (with graalvm build support). I have some legacy java code I wish to maintain, this is impoart for time being. So if I can universally use the same build tool for java also, it would be nice. 
 Note: Wire (a mobile messaging app) seems to be experimenting with scala and JavaFx, and their build tools seem to be maven: https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML3 
 tagging /u/makingthematrix 
 Q2) If not maven, then SBT or Mill, which one fits the above more. My personal bias is more towards Mill, but it has a much smaller ecosystem, so I wonder if it will provide anything close to out of box support for Gluonvm for example.
 ​
 Thanks a tonne

                    <span>The design of a library like linear-base, Tweag’s standard library for Haskell’s
linear types, requires many choices.
One of these choices for linear-base is what a linear Traversable
type class should look like.
One way I use to approach such problems
is to implement instances for the types in GHC.Generics.
GHC.Generics provides a way to implement datatype-generic functions by translating a datatype to and from
a limited set of primitive datatypes representing sums, products, constants, etc.
Therefore, a type class implemented for this set can be given an
instance at a large class of algebraic datatypes.
So this is a nice way to apply structural reasoning to a problem.
The problem
Here is the signature of fmap in linear-base, as it applies, for instance, to lists:

                    <span>Move the Preference setting &quot;Highlight search terms in the editor&quot; to the menu bar. Like the Preference setting &quot;Show image previews in editor.&quot; This will expose it to having a keyboard shortcut. This will make it quick to remove highlighting like this. In this example, I searched for I Need A Frogs Tongue (Don&#x27;t ask.). This is probably a dramatic example, but I daily run into overzealous highlighting, or maybe I should say overzealous searching on my part.
I understand this is meant to be helpful, and sometimes it is. When it is, it is indispensable. When it&#x27;s not, it is an eyesore making it hard to read the zettel.
Will the new MMD editor have this same behavior?</span>

I built a small tool for myself and wanted to share it with you

Up until recently I sent those to myself in Telegram where it creates a nice preview image of the link, which makes it a lot easier to remember what the link was about.

Let me know what you think (maybe I am also the only one who had this kind of problem)

                    <span>After reading so many threads full of thoughtful and in-depth responses, I thought its was finally time to introduce myself. Greetings!
I have kept a paper zettelkasten for the past six months or so, which has benefitted from everyone&#x27;s discourse and guidance here. So, thank you all! I hope to contribute a meager offering now and then to this already robust discussion forum.
Related to my zettelkasten, I use 3x5 index cards filed in an Amazon prime shipping box--it quickly became too unruly for a small file box. I also have experimented with some GTD task management systems in there as well, though my zettelkasten is still the star of the show. I file them using folgezettel numbering, which has proved to be a dangerous business, although I am beating it into submission slowly but surely. The folgezettel debates and related articles are quite fascinating.
The subject matter in my zettelkasten began, as is customary, with zettelkasten itself, but quickly branched out to catalog all of my various other record keeping systems: bullet journaling, morning pages, hobonichi 5-year, and filing methods. It&#x27;s true that I am a stationary person first and foremost, and that&#x27;s probably why I chose a paper system.
I also am particularly interested in how one might use the zettelkasten to chronicle their own personal experiences in the world to create meaning. I found How to Take Smart Notes rather confining in that it had a strong bias towards synthesizing academic research. I&#x27;d like to pivot away from academic towards the subjective. I hope maybe by using my zk to record stories and experiences, it could one day contribute to a work of fiction or memoire.
Anyways, looking forward to continuing to follow this forum and learning from everyone&#x27;s expertise! Cheers!</span>

                    <span>I installed which-key today to discover available key bindings. Problem is, if I type C-x, which key shows some bindings in the mini buffer, which often does not fit there, and it shows 1/3 (page 1 of 3). But how do I get to page 2 or 3? If I click on the mini buffer or click on the scroll bar of mini buffer, or type anything else, the mini buffer disappears! What to do?
 Update: After further observation, I noticed two things:
  
I was wrongly using the next page command. I should have been using &#x27;C-h n C-h n&#x27; to get to third page of which-key popup window instead of &#x27;C-h n n&#x27;
 
However, if I use C-h, when the which-key popup window opens up now with available key binding information, it has now two pages, and I cannot use &#x27;C-h n&#x27; to get to the 2nd page. As soon as I type C-h, emacs interprets it as me invoking C-h C-h and reacts accordingly. How do I solve this case?

                    <span>I am using use-package and I am trying to defer the loading of some packages from my init.el. If I understand correctly, this requires that I specify the commands that are to be autoloaded in a :commands block. For some modes, I have found that this is easy and it works. However, for some modes like geiser, I&#x27;ve tried specifying the obvious entry points (e.g. geiser, run-geiser, and geiser-repl) but portions of geiser are still loading and being shown in the features variable. Is there a way to determine what is causing these features to be loaded? I have tried with :defer set both to t and nil with no effect. Perhaps one complication is that geiser already defines some autoload functions (none of which should be called during initialization, I think) and I am not sure how those interact with :commands and :defer.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been recently playing with org-web-tools and Elisp in general. I&#x27;m completely a Elisp noob and that&#x27;s why I hope to get more information here. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to to use org-capture to create a custom template (not for ORG mode). What I&#x27;d like to have is following:
 * [[%site-title|site-url]] 
 I&#x27;ve found this function which will create an ORG link using org-web-tools:
 ;; https://blog.lazkani.io/posts/text-editors/bookmark-with-org-capture/ (defun org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url () &quot;Extend &#x3D;org-web-tools-inster-link-for-url&#x3D; to take URL from clipboard or kill-ring&quot; (interactive) (org-web-tools--org-link-for-url (org-web-tools--get-first-url))) 
 That function I can use in my org-capture templates like this:
  (&quot;b&quot; &quot;Bookmark (Clipboard)&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/work/sync/org/bookmarks.org&quot; &quot;Bookmarks&quot;) &quot;** %(org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:TIMESTAMP: %t\n:END:\n%?&quot; :prepend t) 
 However how can I modify org-web-tools-insert-link-for-clipboard-url to create a new string like I&#x27;ve mentioned above. The function should return 
 * [[%site-title|s%site-url]] 
 for a given URL in the clipboard. Thanks in advance.

                    <span>In the past previous years, I have tried variety of ways to boost emacs start up time.
  
server + emacsclient
 use-package to defer package loading
 change GC threshold to large value in init.el
 manipulate pdump
 native-comp
  
So far I was able to load most packages without defer in 1s. I was pretty happy.
 Until today, I saw a startup summary function from https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/
 (message &quot;*** Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections.&quot; (format &quot;%.2f seconds&quot; (float-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time))) gcs-done) 
 Then it reports
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.84 seconds with 40 garbage collections. 
 The 40 GCs don&#x27;t quite make sense since I have changed my GC threshold early on in init.el
 Then I tried the following in my early-init.el
 (setq gc-cons-threshold 8000000) ;; ~8MB 
 The number improves to
 *** Emacs loaded in 0.48 seconds with 5 garbage collections. 
 For an example, loading evil changes from
 Loading package evil...done (0.125s) 
 to
 Loading package evil...done (0.064s) 
 Of course, you can further increase GC threshold, but it won&#x27;t make too much impact.
 ​
 So, I finally find a good use case for early-init.el . And here sharing with here. It would be interesting to see if it works for other fellows.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I wanted to share a little package I wrote called preview-org-html-mode. It provides a configurable live preview of an org mode exported to HTML using the xwidget browser in Emacs. I wrote this for personal use but decided to continue to improve my elisp skills.
 Please give it a try if you&#x27;re interested! Still a work-in-progress but it is good enough for my uses. I would also really appreciate any elisp/code suggestions, there are a lot of silly things I think I did in the code but I really don&#x27;t know better and am trying to learn.
 Hope this helps someone, and if not here&#x27;s a fun chance to pick apart some sub-par elisp (please, go for it!)
 Github link: https://github.com/jakebox/preview-org-html-mode
 And yes, I can see how some people might not find this useful, but I enjoy using it in some special cases I find myself in. Use in good health.

 Literally the first line:
 &quot;slimhtml is now part of Org, included in GNU Emacs, future bug reports or contributions should be sent to Org directly. &quot; 
 First of all I am emacs noob.

 I cant find it anywhere, its not in org-export-backends, its not in org export dispatch menu.

                    <span>Not sure if this is possible or not, but I vaguely remember having seen it done in a literate config a while ago.
 E.g. I have something like the table below. Would it be possible to run through it to :bind the keybings or something similar?
 | Key name | Operation | |----------------+--------------------------------| | ~M-~ | Move between windows | | ~M-x ~ | Swap buffer between windows | | ~C-~~ | Next window (key above TAB) | | ~C-TAB~ | Cycle through buffers with IVY | | ~C-x k~ | Kill THIS buffer | | ~C-x +~ | Balance the sizes of windows | 
 I&#x27;m quite unfamiliar with org-mode still, so apologies if this is something obvious or if I&#x27;m explaining things poorly.

                    <span>In the first or second episode in the web series Silicon Valley, Richard Henricks and Jared Dunn interview Dinesh regarding his skills, where he mentions &quot;I Write Sleek, Performant, Low Overhead, Higher-Order functions that will run on anything&quot;. 
 This sentence made me interested in scala. 
 I know it is just a series and it is not necessary that it will have a relation with the real world, but, it just makes me curious.
 So, can anyone explain the relevance of the sentence in the real world?

                    <span>In the excitement around Scala 3, I&#x27;m curious to get a sense of what the norms are (or likely to be) for backend web development at your company (for those who use Scala at work). Or simply - what would you recommend?
 From what I&#x27;ve explored just messing around, Play, Scalatra, Jooby, Vert.x. Thinking of a FastAPI/Flask/Falcon equivalent ideally.
 How do you find Java interop generally? Is it as simple as using a Java library from Scala?
 In a similar vein, what&#x27;s your preferred database interaction library? (I Love SLQAlchemy Core in Python, and Dapper in .NET).
 I&#x27;m also very very curious, coming from Python originally, how you think the migration from 2.x to 3.x will go. (Especially in terms of timeline). Python 2 to 3 was long and a bit painful, but from everything I&#x27;ve read it should be a faster and more comfortable transition for Scala.
 Lastly - it seems SBT is still the tool of choice? Are build times still tricky even with Scala 3? Is it worth hanging around for those to improve, or looking into Mill, or trying to get Gradle to play nice?
 My goal is to dive in and get familiar with the Scala world, but also, evaluate it for use at work.
 Warm thanks!

                    <span>Hi All, so i am reading the red book, part 4 about the effects &amp; I/O. So after reading most of the chapters. I think I got an understanding of IO monad, please comment about it to solidify my understanding .
 So an IO Monad provides methods to execute side effects. so i can use those provided methods for sequencing computations, that depend on side effect ( reading data / writing data ) . More like a effects interface / type class.
 ​
 Thank You

                    <span>This is a response to Will&#x27;s Zettel Sharing ... and the interesting interactions which are happening there.
I don&#x27;t have a Zettelkasten, yet (not sure if I ever will have).  I love to read what others are saying about their adventures.  Reading the discussions, in that and other threads, sometimes makes my head hurt.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m smart enough to think so abstractly about such things.  I admire all those here who share their thoughts about how they think about thinking.
I did not want to interrupt or hijack that discussion, but I would like to share my initial reaction:  &quot;What would a Shared Zettelkasten look like?&quot;.
I think that I understand, from what I&#x27;ve read here, and elsewhere, that a Zettelkasten is a personal database, where one keeps notes and builds upon research and thoughts which are read and created while living life.  The hope is to generate and discover new and interesting things while revisiting and exploring new and unfamiliar territory.
The basis of my question is, why should everyone have to start from zero and build upon things that they happen to discover.  The &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; resonates with me.  I&#x27;m just wondering if there is some way to share a Zettelkasten (or many).  Maybe this does not make any sense.  Maybe this already exists (Yahoo groups, Discord, Discourse, Reddit, etc.)?
Just wondering if anyone else has any similar thoughts.</span>

                    <span>Does someone have a solution for tab (not alt-tab) to complete in cc-mode with completion at point functions? I use eglot for completion sources and it correctly sets completion at point functions
 completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in minibuffer.el. Value in # (eglot-completion-at-point t) 
 But c-tab-always-indent doesn&#x27;t respect the same logic as tab-always-ident which when set to &#x27;complete first indents if necessary and then completes via emacs builtin completion at point mechanims, so works fine in, say, emacs lisp mode. Can I get this same &quot;tab indents then completes&quot; functionality in c/cc modes?
 ​
 Thanks for any pointers.

                    <span>Hello, all.
 I am new to emacs and am trying to figure out if it&#x27;s possible to use emacs as a sort of textual interface (e.g. text and ascii graphics) to a graph database. 
 The interface would need to be bidirectional in the sense that I could run certain commands and type certain things into the interface (although be constrained to not be able to type arbitrary text since not all text would correspond to a graph) and have the graph database be updated according to what I had entered, but also, if some external program updated the graph database, the displayed textual representation should be updated as necessary.
 Example:
 The graph has the nodes and edges: A node has an ID which is automatically generated upon its creation, a possibly empty string name, and a possible empty list of la…</span>

                    <span>Hey there,
 Was wondering if the following was possible:
 - If someone had to make a TODO list in Org-Mode, but be able to export the live changes to a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for their boss to review and make related edits within Google Sheets, is this possible?
 I know org-babel and Pandoc exist, and would be able to export things nicely.
 I just didn&#x27;t know if Emacs had any Google Sheet integration with live spreadsheets somehow.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Fellow emacsers. 
 After researching into ergonomic split keyboards and keyboard customizations (I will probably buy a keyboardio model 100), I&#x27;m playing with the idea of trying key chords in emacs, but found not much about it in the wild wild web. 
 In this case key chords means 2 simultaneously pressed keys without modifiers as in https://github.com/emacsorphanage/key-chord.
 Those chords can be mapped to any command, so for example, in Spanish gh is a very uncommon pair. So we could map that to save-buffer, making it faster and easier (in a Dvorak layout) than C-x C-s.
 Does any of you tried it? If you did, what worked for you and what didn&#x27;t? 
 As always, thank you very much for your time, attention and knowledge sharing... :)
 PD: edited to make it clearer what &quot;chording&quot; means in this question. Thanks /u/7890yuiop :)

                    <span>I am an emacs noob, I am following the built-in tutorial and I have a problem with &quot;M-&quot; which is supposed to &quot;Kill the word immediately before the cursor&quot;. When I press &quot;M-&quot; (meaning &quot;Alt-Backspace&quot;), it deletes the next character after the cursor instead. I.e. on my Linux system with emacs 26.3, &quot;M-&quot; does the same thing as &quot;C-d&quot;.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 26.3 in Windows 10 (I work in a Windows intensive environment, and I had to give up the struggle of using Linux). And just this morning, for no reason that I can see, the second command C-f in a command sequence fails to register. 
 For example, I was editing a LaTeX file using AucTeX, which has C-x C-f C-e for entering emphasized text. But the second command key, the C-f, couldn&#x27;t be entered. Emacs stopped at C-x and refused to accept another command key. 
 I closed Emacs down and restarted, and entered C-x C-f to access a file, and again, the C-f wouldn&#x27;t register. It&#x27;s not a problem with my keyboard: the f key works fine (see this post?) and the only changes to my .emacs file have been some minor font changes for font-lock-mode. 
 It seems to involve only C-f. Other sequences do work: C-x C-b for example, or C-x C-s. But C-x C-f is a sequence I use a lot, and I have no idea why it&#x27;s not working. Any ideas? Thanks!

                    <span>The key bindings in Doom Emacs are sometimes unexpected. For example, the undo command in M-x calc is mapped to lowercase u, instead of the usual uppercase U.
 M-x which-key-show-top-levelshows that key binding on page 2 of 8, but I found it accidentally.
 https://preview.redd.it/dcymg45u5i971.jpg?width&#x3D;1405&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;58f4621a3a160971399a8d8424cce76a1f8ab8a6
 Is there a way to / search the top-level key bindings, without having to manually go through all 8 pages (via C-h j)?
 More generally, how can I find the most relevant (&quot;context sensitive&quot;) key bindings? The usual C-h m is not too helpful in Doom Emacs (M-x calc) , as it simply shows the original key binding, followed by &quot;that binding is currently shadowed by another mode&quot;.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a student, and after learning Haskell in a club last year and using it extensively in a side project recently, I feel like it&#x27;s currently the language I&#x27;m most comfortable with. As I prepare to apply for internships for next summer, I&#x27;m wondering if it would be a bad idea to prepare for leetcode-style questions in Haskell.
 Does anyone have experience using it in a &quot;regular&quot; internship interview? (By regular I mean ones where you don&#x27;t expect to use any Haskell in the job.)
 I guess I&#x27;m worried that either the interviewer will just decline to let me use the language, or otherwise let me but still have a negative view of it. In that case I could offer to use a more mainstream language, but I&#x27;d be less practiced in it.
 But I also think using Haskell and it&#x27;s type system helps me tremendously in thinking through difficult problems, so in that way I could see it as an advantage.
 Any advice from either side (interns or interviewers) would be great. Thanks!

                    <span>I am happy to announce the first release of https://hackage.haskell.org/package/typeable-mock
 Its goal is to make mocking functions possible in the context of any monad and with as little boilerplate as possible.
 It is inspired by how easy mocking is in the Python or JS. The mocks are dispatched dynamically by name and type. Only the call site and the test cases are aware of a mock, so the changes are small and never require restructuring of the application for testing.
 I wrote it to make writing tests more enjoyable and I hope you enjoy it too!
 PS: [ANN #2] to record the arguments of the function calls and expecting calls, typeable-mock needs to process the arguments and result of arbitrary functions. The solution turned out to be more general than mocks needed, so I published it as a separate library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/variadic-function

                    <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m trying to obfuscate some data in a dataset to practise Haskell and I&#x27;m running into some difficulties, particularly with regards to memoisation.
 The dataset contains some IP addresses which I want to anonymise by shuffling the last octet (e.g., mapping 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.231) and some email addresses, where I want to tokenise the username (e.g., mapping alice@gmail.com to v38j8a@gmail.com, where v38j8a is just a string generated randomly). Importantly, these IPs and email addresses can appear numerous times, and I want to mapping to be 1-1 (e.g, alice@gmail.com is always mapped to v38j8a@gmail.com). It seems pretty clear that I need to memoize my obfuscation functions.
 I&#x27;ve written some parsers and such that takes care of all this but without any memoization. I&#x27;m trying to use the MemoTrie library, but I&#x27;m running into difficulty - as I&#x27;m making heavy use of System.Random, basically everything I&#x27;m working with is in the IO monad, and MemoTrie seems to have little support for that. I can memoize an Int -&gt; Int function but not an Int -&gt; IO Int.
 Would anyone here know how to extend MemoTrie to support the IO monad? The MemoTrie documentation for adding your own data types isn&#x27;t great and it&#x27;s unclear how to write a sensible implementation of HasTrie. Alternatively, I can get the results that I want in a relatively straightforward manner by just using unsafePerformIO. Is this a reasonable solution? It feels kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; using unsafePerformIO, but I can&#x27;t immediately see any negative consequences that might arise in this setting.
 Thanks very much for any help.
 Edit: an example of using MemoTrie and unsafePerformIO to handle the IO monad can be seen here: https://github.com/ocharles/dhall-build/blob/master/MemoIO.hs

 (EDIT not just backend-ed by emacs but to have the interaction in emacs)
 Any ideas? Perhaps we need to wait for nyxt to be fully developed..

                    <span>Hey
 I would like to convert some org-mode files to markdown (for easy viewing on Bitbucket), but seems as
 pandoc -o x.md x.org 
 misses some of the org-formatting, eg. images are not included.
 There are many ways to do the things in org-mode, maybe I am just doing it in a &quot;wrong&quot; way. How do you convert from org to md?
 Image example 1:
 #+CAPTION: Image caption #+NAME: fig:image\_name #+ATTR\_HTML: :width 100% #+ATTR\_ORG: :width 100% file:files/my_img.jpg 
 Image example 2:
 [[files/my_img_2.jpg]]

 https://open.kattis.com/help/scala
 which makes me believe it should be possible to submit Scala files. Choosing Java as a language does not seem to work for me.
 Update: According to Kattis support, they have a full Scala implementation that is currently disabled due to the performance of Scala programs.

                    <span>(This is a release announcement written as a cautionary tale about the dangers of building your own tools...)
 So I was working through the Roguelike tutorials...
 Field of view in a roguelike
 ...and thought the engine performance could be better - quite normal - every time I build a new type of game I find new ways that Indigo could be better. Tweaked Indigo to change how it deals with large arrays destined for the GPU. While I was there I fixed some other stuff ...and also added the ability to dynamically load shaders. Here are the release notes:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.9.0
 That allowed me to simplify the Roguelike Starterkit and make it faster (if anyone is following along, upgrade!):
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit
 ...but with the new dynamic shader loading I realised I could also solve another problem I&#x27;d been wondering about: How to share live Indigo shader demos?
 Thought it would be fun to have a little website that rendered Indigo flavoured shaders from GitHub gists (no backend, GitHub does the storage, easy peasy...), but website building for me means using Tyrian (an Elm-like web framework), and that also needed an upgrade:
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/releases/tag/v0.2.0
 ...but I did eventually build the site:
 https://purplekingdomgames.github.io/shadergist/?gist&#x3D;davesmith00000/5a6b585dbc2184a2c215b16a91234c22
 And thus all the yaks were shaved. Back to game building.

                    <span>Wire Signals is a small event-handling library. It started as a part of the Wire Android codebase. About two thirds of Wire Android is written in Scala, making it unique among Android apps - most of them being implemented in Java and/or Kotlin. Wire is a messenger and as such it must be very responsive: it has to quickly react to any events coming from the backend, as well as from the user, and from the Android OS itself. Most, if not all of the available solutions focus on the backend, so we developed our own implementation of event streams and &quot;signals&quot; - special event streams with caches holding the last propagated value. They proved to be a very flexible and concise way of handling events. During the last we moved that code to a separate repository, rewrote it, added more tests, added …</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone I am a college student taking scala this semester. Our professor has given us a project where he wants us to display the total number of deaths by covid for a specific country using a scala program using scala collections.
 The txt file has records for each country, new cases, new deaths each day, date, total number of deaths etc.
 I&#x27;m struggling to find a way to display the results. I have searched online and found that the basic step would be to something similar to:
 import scala.io.Source
 val lines &#x3D; Source.fromFile(&quot;/Users/Al/.bash_profile&quot;).getLines.toList
 How can I extract specific record from txt file? Any kind of help would be appreciated thankyou

 I personaly like both of them, and professionaly I&#x27;m using Typelevel stack, but just can&#x27;t undestand hatred directed to ZIO ecosystem without sane explanation. 
 Is there any reason, besides that ZIO is achieving more and more market share?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working with akka-stream and would like to define a Flow that takes some data from a Source and writes each record to another system. After all of the records have been written, I need to call a close() method. I&#x27;m running the stream with .runWith(Sink.ignore), and I&#x27;d like to ensure the runWith Future completes only after the close() method has completed.
 So far I&#x27;ve found two ways that seem like they could work with Flows: alsoToMat and watchTermination. In both cases, the runWith Future completes before the close method has completed.
 I&#x27;ve gotten it to work by using .toMat, but this turns the Flow into a Sink. I&#x27;d prefer to keep it as a Flow if possible.
 I wrote this up as an example App on Scastie: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/alexklibisz/baWl6EB7TkSjL7DMV2ZX5Q/2
 I appreciate that identifying the last element of a stream is a tricky problem. 
 It seems like there is some precedent for making this kind of thing work. For example, it seems that the FileSource can close a file handle before the full stream has completed. FileSource is implemented as a more complicated custom graph stage. I&#x27;d prefer to avoid that if possible, but I don&#x27;t mind doing it if necessary.

This problem is a little different than usual because it wants you to return a sequence and not just the length. I feel like I found the length in an efficient way, using dynamic programming. But because I am new to scala and not that great at algorithms, I don&#x27;t think I constructed the subsequence efficiently. Here is my code:

 It&#x27;s as close as I could get to a straight clone of ScalaTags with the twist that everything is done with macros at compile-time, so it reduces the runtime processing to mostly just concatenating literal strings with a few dynamic strings in an Array with a StringBuilder, with the upshot being that it&#x27;s between 2 and 10 times faster at runtime than ScalaTags (which is already quite quick) depending on the exact nature of the workload it&#x27;s given.

                    <span>Sharing this awesome helper function I came across here: re-builder-query-replace-this 
 when bound to a key in the re-builder window can go straight into regexp query replace (as described in the post). 
 One thing which would make it nicer imo is for the re-builder window to quit after the query replace is done -- currently, after the query replace finishes one is left in the target window with the replacement still highlighted so one has to switch to the re-builder and then quit the re-builder. I tried raising the save-excursion call before selecting the target window but that isn&#x27;t cutting it - anyone know a simple/clean way without hardc-oding buffer names and such?
 for reference, here is the unaltered function def:
  (defun reb-query-replace-this-regxp (replace) &quot;Uses the regexp built with re-builder to query the target buffer. This function must be run from within the re-builder buffer, not the target buffer. Argument REPLACE String used to replace the matched strings in the buffer. Subexpression references can be used (\1, \2, etc).&quot; (interactive &quot;sReplace with: &quot;) (if (eq major-mode &#x27;reb-mode) (let ((reg (reb-read-regexp))) (select-window reb-target-window) (save-excursion (beginning-of-buffer) (query-replace-regexp reg replace))) (message &quot;Not in a re-builder buffer!&quot;)))

                    <span>I saw no configuration variable to do this; but it is a little bit anoying because I use a dark theme and should change it when using latex because snippets are rendered in black.

                    <span>As far as I can tell, there is no pre-defined face for categories in agenda views. Instead the category just uses the same face as the header text, i.e. org-scheduled-today, org-scheduled-previously, etc..
 Is there any way that I could customize the category face in agenda views?
 Category are distinct agenda elements, so it is possible to perhaps create a face for them?
 By the way, I often use org-super-agenda. I don&#x27;t think org-super-agenda can handle this issue, but I am not very familiar with its line formatting capabilties.

                    <span>Since pcre2el got quite some attention lately.
 Has someone played/experimented with emacs-pcre? 
 emacs-pcre uses libpcre, nicely compiles, works and gives the complete Perl Compatible RegEx feature set (as opposed to pcre2el) to emacs.
 Sadly the (user) commands, which would make emacs-pcre convenient are completely missing from the package.
 This is sad, because all the power those missing user commands could give.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve understood continuations for years in the sense that I know they have something to do with control-flow, they form a monad, they&#x27;re very powerful, etc. But I never really had a strong understanding of them in the sense that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to write my own continuation monad without using a reference for all the operations. The sort of thing where I would only really ever use continuations if I&#x27;m using do-notation to package them up. I just didn&#x27;t see how they worked under the hood.
 Recently I was re-reading Wadler&#x27;s comprehending monads, which has a nice section on the continuation monad and how to translate to CPS for both call-by-value and call-by-name. In particular, I was translating his monad comprehensions all the way down to their respective continuations. This lead me to r…</span>

                    <span>Hi, it&#x27;s me again. I&#x27;m now looking for a senior Haskell dev to join my team at Standard Chartered bank, in London.
 My team sits in front office and has about 20 Haskell devs (well, technically Mu, our in-house variant). We work in close collaboration with trading, sales, and structuring to build diverse software, from desktop GUI applications to server-side financial analytics reports and services. For this role we expect hands-on experience with a couple of large Haskell / OCaml projects, and/or managing a team.
 Feel free to reach out to me directly if you&#x27;re interested and have any questions, but applications should go via this link: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100017588
 A more junior role that I advertised before, also in London, is still open: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100012204
 Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period. We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful applicants.

                    <span>Hi all!
 I just published (on Hackage) my first ever Haskell library, StrongPath, which provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time than standard FilePath (well, String).
 It is heavily inspired by path library, which we used in Wasp-lang a lot and loved it, but then we wanted even more type safety so I ended up creating StrongPath.
 I still consider myself relatively new to writing production-level Haskell code so I would appreciate more experienced among you taking a look and giving some advice on what could be improved!
 Source code: https://github.com/wasp-lang/strong-path
 Some specific things I would love to get a second thought on:
 1. I ended up with a lot of duplication / boilerplate in the code, repeating same / similar logic …</span>

                    <span>Hi guys, newbie here!
 I&#x27;m into a research internship based on Haskell for my master&#x27;s degree. Short version: we would like to work on an implementation for a linear type system (https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/linear-types/roadmap). 
 First question: I&#x27;ve been studying Haskell for a few months and I&#x27;m trying to go deep into the GHC. What is the starting point? You have any good resources for a better understanding of what it does?
 Second question: this is the first time that I try to &quot;extend&quot; a compiler. I&#x27;m excited but also a bit scared. What is the &quot;protocol&quot;? There is something that i should know? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 From the description, it seems to be a Haskell library.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I want to share a small library with you. Please go ahead and roast it.
 Its a linked list with size completely determined at compile time.
 It is of limited practicality, but you can do some cool stuff.
  
Compile error when accessing head or tail of empty list.
 
Compile error when .get at index greater than size.
 
You can only zip with list of same size.
 You can split a list, and you get two lists each of which has the correct size.
 Concatenation of lists results in list with correct size.
 
 
cats.Traverse instance
  
Cross compiled for 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13.

However, I&#x27;m in doubt about how to best handle in-text citations. E.g.: In my first, failed Zettelkasten attempt, I had a Zettel on the Feynman Technique. In that Zettel, I cited some random blog post I found. I had doubts about the technique, so I read another random blog post. This resulted in a Zettel that looked something like this:
Some description of what the technique is about [citekey1][citekey2].

The steps:

1. do x [citekey1][citekey2].
2. do y [citekey1][citekey2]. Optionally, do z [citekey1].
3. do a [citekey1][citekey2].
4. do b [citekey2].

You do step number two because of reason c [citekey2].

I ask:
If I had wanted to show how the two sources differed in their description of the technique, was the resulting Zettel the best way to do so, or should I have made separate Zettels for each source?
In general, how should I approach citations in my Zettelkasten so I don&#x27;t question what I do like in the scenario described?
I appreciate your comments in advance.</span>

 I vaguely remember seeing a library which used the YouTube API to convert a playlist/channel and turn it into a set of Org headlines, did I imagine it, if not I guess I&#x27;ll have to write it!

                    <span>Hi guy so recently I learnt about Emacs and wanted to give it a go mostly for fun but also cause I would like to use org-mode to boost my productivity and manage to focus, so as the title says I&#x27;m a non programmer I&#x27;ve written some code in c# but not full time and mostly for curiosity. So far I&#x27;ve downloaded doom Emacs and dabble a bit with it but I cannot even install org-bullets to change the asterisk in org-mode... so yeah i guess that says a lot I hope you guys can point me to the right track thanks in advance

 Is it me or any one of you guys experience the same? Btw, I am starting to really appreciate emacs keybindings.

                    <span>I currently have to decide whether to go to Charlmers University or Utrecht University for my master&#x27;s. And I feel like I do not have enough knowledge to base that decision on. Have you done your bachlor&#x27;s at Utrecht University and you master&#x27;s at Charlmers University or the other way around or your PhD? I would love to have a chat. Let me know when you have time, please.
 EDIT: Maybe I should mention why I ask this question here. These are the two EU universities most closely connected to functional programming, static type systems, and Haskell that I could find.

                    <span>I&#x27;m disturbed by the Haskell Foundation accepting sponsorship from IOHK, a company incorporated in Hong Kong.
 The recent suppression of free speech and democratic activism in Hong Kong has been condemned publicly by the leaders of many Western nations, including the USA, UK and Australia. The arrests conducted under this new law seem arbitrarily targeted, and many commentators have described them as being directed by President Xi personally, to suppress dissent.
 However, IOHK is still incorporated in Hong Kong, despite being (to use their own description) &quot;a fully decentralised remote working organisation&quot;. IOHK appears to be well-funded, having (again, from their website) &quot;400+ people across 50+ countries&quot;, and therefore would appear to have had every opportunity to leave Hong Kong, if they did not support the actions of the CCP.
 In the past, people on this subreddit have loudly and forcefully condemned US-based companies like Facebook, and US defense contractors, for their use of Haskell, and have stated they would not work for those companies.
 Is anyone else equally disturbed by this funding arrangement for the Haskell Foundation? At what point would it become disturbing to accept money from a remote company that is happily headquartered in an authoritarian regime?

 I&#x27;m trying to improve my haskell understanding and was attempting re write of go code that I did few weeks ago. my current best implementation is taking about 500% of go code, and I&#x27;m looking for ways to improve wall clock time for haskell script.
 task is to parse 2 text files, and comparing their content. format of files is
 DOCID_{num}\t{num}\t{num0},{f0} {num1},{f1} ..... {numN},{fN}\n 
 It&#x27;s mainly a repost of https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/263682/parsing-custom-text-file-using-haskell/263731#263731 , where I&#x27;m trying to get haskell code wall clock time as close to golang as possible
 Edit1: Adding algorithm for the code for completeness .
 to perform this comparison efficiently I have sorted both input files based on numeric…</span>

                    <span>Hey everybody, after having built some web applications with Scala/Scala.js, we started stripping common functionality out into a reusable template.
 While this is similar to bootzooka, the main difference is the tech stack.
 For anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried building web apps in Scala.js, let me tell you that it is a lovely experience, having worked with several JavaScript frameworks before, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Scala.js + Slinky (React) + Scalablytyped.
 There is still lots of stuff to do but if we focus on getting it perfect, we wouldn&#x27;t get to a release date ever.

                    <span>Greeetings from a newbie.
Today, I see the Devonthink for Historians Youtube channel posted some thoughts about keeping a Zettelkasten.
Being new to the way of the Zettel, I don&#x27;t know if their ideas match well with the Zettelkasten community.
It was interesting to hear them talk about &quot;evolutionary sifting,&quot; which I think is probably similar to the Zettelkasten Boy Scout rule, leaving notes better than you found them.
Anyway, if it&#x27;s of interest -  .</span>

                    <span>I don&#x27;t like that I have to choose between using the easy to use minor modes like &#x60;display-battery-mode&#x60; and &#x60;lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable&#x60; versus setting &#x60;modeline-format&#x60;. I still want the info from lsp-modeline for example, I just want to tweak the spacing and such of the modeline.
 Is there a way to mess with the modeline without resorting to modeline-format, or is there a way to get the info that lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable adds to the modeline so I can create a custom one without reinventing all these nice modeline modes?

                    <span>My file has a sequence of 1000 numbers, generated in Emacs Evil mode via:
 :r!seq 1000
 I want to keep all numbers with consecutive digits of either 2 or 3 (e.g., 22, 23, 32, 33, 122, 123, 132).
 M-x keep-lines RET [23]\{2\}
 The above works fine, but the following does not work:
 M-: (keep-lines &quot;[23]\{2\}&quot;)
 What is the correct syntax for the latter approach (M-:)? Appreciate a link to the documentation.

                    <span>Hey, did anyone try gtk-3 branch on windows? Does it work? Are there any benefits? I&#x27;m mainly interested if thre are any improvements in hidpi handling since gtk-3 rewrite handles hidpi on Linux pretty well. Also, if there is a decent documantation of how to build it on windows I&#x27;d be thankful for them

                    <span>I am using Cygwin on Windows for Emacs and I am unable to get MELPA to work. I am not sure if I am missing a package that needs to be installed and if so which ones but here is my .emacs file:
 ​
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) ;; Comment/uncomment this line to enable MELPA Stable if desired. See &#x60;package-archive-priorities&#x60; ;; and &#x60;package-pinned-packages&#x60;. Most users will not need or want to do this. ;;(add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-initialize) 
 ​
 When I try : 
 M-x package-refresh-contents 
 I get the following:
 Error while verifying signature archive-contents.sig: Command output: gpg: keyblock resource &#x27;/home/jogre/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: can&#x27;t open &#x27;/tmp/epg-signatureQXh3st&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: verify signatures failed: No such file or directory

                    <span>I started using emacs like about 2 weeks, I did enjoy the experience in emacs especially the org-mode. I have some questions regarding some packages that are available for Emacs form the repositories. Since I was familiar with the keyboard navigation style in neovim, I used the package named Evil in Emacs to get vi like naviagtion but, My tab key seems to not respond in the org-mode. I wanted it to give me tabspaces but the cursor is being lazy and standing still. My configuration file that I have written so far is shared here. Emacs experts please help me and point me in right directions. Thanks.

 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for Unicode text. Now you can print Unicode text using TrueType fonts.
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>Hi all, started using Emacs yesterday to write down study notes and managed to activate math symbols preview in the buffer with Mx set-input-method TeX.
 Now I want to specify it in the org file so I don&#x27;t have to type out the command each time I open Emacs, how can it be done? I googled it to no avail, some anwers show a piece of lisp code but I have no idea where to put it and the manual page I&#x27;ve found is not too clear as well.
 I&#x27;m using vanilla Emacs with no customizations.

                    <span>Hello,I&#x27;m switching from vim to emacs. 
 I also want to use native emacs key bindings rather than evil , but
 Emacs tutorial , hasn&#x27;t much ergonomics methods compared to vimtutor .
 I&#x27;m sure, emacs tutorial hiding their methods,
 all I can see in Emacs tutorial is just basic forward , backward , search, nothing detailed ergonomics . 
 Would i know more ?

                    <span>As a speed test, I generated a file with a sequence of 10000 numbers in command line:
 seq 10000 &gt; seq.txt
 I want to keep only numbers with the digits 2, 4, and 6. 
 Using VIM, the following command completes in less than a second:
 :v/^[246]*$/d
 However, when using Emacs Evil mode, it takes more than a minute of my CPU time! Why is it so much slower? Is there an equivalent eLisp command that would be faster? Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got this code from Chapter 39 of Get Programming with Haskell
 import qualified Data.ByteString as B import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BC import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as LC import Network.HTTP.Simple myToken :: BC.ByteString myToken &#x3D; &quot;RXQqorkfHCNzzgJjtYcZXKfdgrpYtkfB&quot; noaaHost :: BC.ByteString noaaHost &#x3D; &quot;www.ncdc.noaa.gov&quot; apiPath :: BC.ByteString apiPath &#x3D; &quot;/cdo-web/api/v2/datasets&quot; response &#x3D; httpLBS &quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot; 
 then this works
 getResponseStatusCode  response 
 giving back 200 just fine. This also seems to go in fine
 buildRequest :: BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; BC.ByteString -&gt; Request buildRequest token host method path &#x3D; setRequestMethod method $ setRequestHost host $ setRequestHeader &quot;token&quot; [token] $ setRequestPath path $ setRequestSecure True $ setRequestPort 443 $ defaultRequest request :: Request request &#x3D; buildRequest myToken noaaHost &quot;GET&quot; apiPath 
 but this is a build and run project with this finally
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do response &lt;- httpLBS request let status &#x3D; getResponseStatusCode response if status &#x3D;&#x3D; 200 then do print &quot;saving request to file&quot; let jsonBody &#x3D; getResponseBody response L.writeFile &quot;data.json&quot; jsonBody else print &quot;request failed with error&quot; 
 Question: Can this final section be repackaged/redone to also work at the REPL? (Using :{ ... :} of course.)

 508kB It&#x27;s what I got with it gziped. Didn&#x27;t find the recommended way to uglify it.
 Maybe I did something wrong? What is the size it should be? (of the js boundle I mean)

                    <span>Building a web-app backend in Scala, I&#x27;m looking for a normal/standard library/framework stack that a typical scala dev would use on a simple backend project that supports the following: HTTP server/API, sql database connection, authentication.
 Coming from the JavaScript world, this stack might be Express (server) + Sequelize (db ORM) + Passport.js (authentication).
 Hoping you all can help cut through the noise and point me in the right direction here :).
 Thank you.

https://www.slideshare.net/mosessampaul/introduction-to-luhmanns-zettelkasten-thinking ), but more as a network of (deliberately, not automatically) linked notes. This leads to a lack of hierarchy in my library, which I believe can become a bit difficult to navigate after a while.
So I have two questions:

                    <span>I am in the process of switching from qwerty to colemak through the tarmak layouts. 
 Have you ever switched layout in Emacs? Did you temporarily remap your core bindings (I mean, you don&#x27;t want to hit C-k by accident when you think you&#x27;re hitting C-n, right?) Or did you go straight to the new bindings? What are pros and cons of these approaches? Looking forward to hear your stories and your opinion

 In this case we want to check that unit tests remain speedy for a Clojure project. It works also for Scala (and Java I think, not tested). Some tweaking needed for other languages that can export test results to XML reports following JUnit reports.

                    <span>I am in the process of learning Haskell and I just had an epiphany but I want to make sure I haven&#x27;t quite gone off the deep end yet.
 To compare it to C#, a Monad is what an Interface is to a Class in C#, but with all inherited behavior fully defined in the Interface.
 The four Monad operations that I am aware of in Haskell, &gt;&gt;&#x3D;, &gt;&gt;, return and fail, are used to programatically add and change an Interface onto a set of data, or Class in C#.
 This allows a clean set of data to have any interface attached to it and have whatever predefined behavior performed on that data.
 Let me know if I am about right or pretty far off!

 Okay, recursion is so much more concise...

                    <span>Hello, I just started learning Haskell few weeks ago and first worked through the LYAH and now go through the recommended wikibook from the official Haskell site and solve along the 99 problems and some codewars (I hope this is a good approach right now). 
 To learn to build something more real world and less synthetic, I decided to create a small web app where users can rate and comment on courses from my university and then went looking for an appropriate framework. In the official wiki I found https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ which looks like an incredible piece of software engineering and I immediately watched their 25 minute video of demonstration and quite fell in love with it. BUT I am worried that using this would take away a lot of classical Haskell, because to me it seems a lot like Django or similar frameworks. With their different custom syntax operators like |&gt; I feel like I’d be more learning their framework than actually Haskell. Is that a legitimate concern? My main goal is not to build a wonderful web app that makes me $$$ but just to build something with Haskell that is useful and that I can extend over time. 
 Would a more lightweight framework be more appropriate and if so which? Is my impression of it not being really haskelly wrong? It feels like a lot of what makes haskell awesome has been abstracted away for ease of usage which is great for production but probably not for learning. 
 I hope my question is clear and you can understand my concern. Thanks for any input.

 I’m looking for some beginner friendly repo’s that I can read to see how actual programs are made end-to-end using Haskell ?

                    <span>I updated org yesterday from 9.4.4 to 9.4.6 and found that when marking a recurring task done, it was permanently marked DONE instead of having its timestamp updated and todo status left as TODO. An inactive timestamp was also recorded in the logbook, but LAST_REPEAT in the properties drawer was not updated.
 Looking at the version 9.4 release notes, I saw that org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region now defaults to t. I checked the docstring, as the release notes suggest, and while I can&#x27;t say that I found it very enlightening, something told me I should try changing it. I set it to nil and marking tasks done in their own file buffer started to work as before, but marking them done from the agenda was still a problem. Reading a little further, I saw a new and related variable, also defaulting to t, called org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region. I set that to nil and now everything seems to be working as before.
 Still, after reading the docstrings and the manual, I don&#x27;t understand what these variables really do. Plus, since the release notes are for 9.4 I imagine they were already defaulting to t in 9.4.4, which worked fine for me. Finally, I cannot seem to find anybody else having reported the same problem. All of which is to say that I am not confident that I have really solved it. Maybe I &quot;solved&quot; a side-effect of another problem instead?
 Can anybody give me a bit of insight that will either give me confidence in my solution or help me find the real problem?

Critique is educational.

Why questions reveal secrets.
Secrets reveal how answers.

Associated Types In Two Different Ways by Morrow
Suppose you wanted to write a type class for indexable containers. But now, we decide that we also want to be able to index Maps as well. The issue is that we’ve already hard-coded the index type to…</span>

                    <span>On my home network I have two computers, both running Windows 10.
 On the desktop computer, I&#x27;ve got VcXsrv and WSL1 running, and I have the Linux build of Gnu Emacs 27.1 running under WSL and displaying through X Windows.
 On the laptop computer, I&#x27;ve got VcXsrv running.
 On the emacs on the desktop, I run M-x make-frame-on-display to pop up a frame on the laptop. This way, I have only one instance of emacs running, and I can view and edit the same buffers from both computers without worry of getting my files out of sync. (I tend to pace my apartment while I work, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to access my buffers from two different rooms.)
 Unfortunately, when the laptop goes to sleep, the emacs on the desktop computer freezes for a few seconds and then crashes.
 What would you suggest as a workaround or fix?
 (Please don&#x27;t suggest &quot;delete the frame on the laptop before putting the laptop to sleep&quot;. Yes that would presumably work but I won&#x27;t remember to do that.)

                    <span>i&#x27;m using a spreadsheet in org mode and am trying to figure out how many occurrences i have of a string, specifically &quot;sfp28-10glr-31 intel&quot;. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that does this in my searches and was hoping you might be able to shed some light. 
 thanks much for your help
 the table structure looks like this
 | sfp28-10glr-31 intel, sfp28-10glr-31 cisco, 3m fiber cable | sfp28-10glr-31 intel, sfp28-10glr-31 cisco, 3m fiber cable |

                    <span>I finally figured out how to set up lsp-mode within Doom emacs and I&#x27;m having more fun editing code with emacs than ever before. One question I had though is that when there&#x27;s a &#x27;fix available&#x27; (currently editing c++ code) and it tells me the fix to perform, what&#x27;s the command/shortcut for doing such fix? Apologies for the stupid question I&#x27;ve been using emacs for a few months now and have always just worked with my own (pretty poor) config and am just now realizing what lsp is and why it&#x27;s useful lol.

                    <span>I have (setq gnus-gcc-externalize-attachments &#x27;all) in my configuration, in order not to save sent attachments on disk in my Gcc group. Unfortunately, Gnus has been ignoring this setting (or at least it does not work anymore) since I upgraded from Emacs 26 to Emacs 27.2 with Gnus 5.13.
 Is anybody else having this problem or knows what might be going on?

                    <span>Version: Emacs 26.3 on Debian/Ubuntu 
 Is there a way to use env variables in a link in orgmode?
 So I put a variable NEXT in my /etc/environment file and (getenv &quot;NEXT&quot;) in my init.el file and so far it works. When I want to open a new file, I can use $NEXT in my path, which is nice.
 But sometimes I want to use links with $NEXT instead of \very\long\path\to\Nextcloud in them and that seems to not really work. 
 Is there a way to make this work?

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting this generated heading when I run org-hugo-export-to-md
 ## Heading {#heading} 
 What I really want is just
 ## Heading 
 After reading the docs, I thought that the https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/usage/#org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading is responsible for setting this behaviour. But when I look through counsel-describe-variable, this variable doesn&#x27;t show up in the list.
 Anyways, I&#x27;ve tried setting the variable via these two methods:
 Setting it in my config.el
 (use-package ox-hugo :ensure t :after ox :custom (org-hugo-base-dir &quot;.&quot;) (org-hugo-front-matter-format &quot;yaml&quot;) (org-hugo-section &quot;braindump&quot;) (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading &quot;&quot;)) 
 Setting it in .dir-locals.el
 ((nil . ((org-hugo-base-dir . &quot;.&quot;) (org-hugo-front-matter-format . &quot;yaml&quot;) (org-hugo-section . &quot;braindump&quot;) (org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading &quot;&quot;))) 
 But no luck.
 I&#x27;ve posted this issue in the ox-hugo github here https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/449 but I figured maybe I can get a quicker response here since I think the issue is coming from my config not the package.
 EDIT:
 The author of the library replied in the GitHub issue. There is a way to disable it. But it doesn&#x27;t help me in my overall goal. Thanks for reading.

                    <span>Hi, currently learning Haskell and pretty much everywhere I look I am told that one should avoid explicit recursion and try and use functional abstractions like fold or map.
 This has caused me some pain when, as an exercise, I was implementing the library function dropWhile. My initial implementation using explicit recursion looked like this:
 dropWhile :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] dropWhile _ [] &#x3D; [] dropWhile p xs@(x:xs&#x27;) | p x &#x3D; dropWhile&#x27; p xs&#x27; | otherwise &#x3D; xs 
 This also seems to match the implementation used in the GHC source code.
 After some perusing I found an example using foldr as follows:
 dropWhile :: (a -&gt; Bool )-&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] dropWhile p &#x3D; fst . foldr f ([], []) where f x ~(xs,ys) &#x3D; (if p x then xs else x:ys, x:ys) 
 After some head wracking I do understand the second definition. However I would like to know if this is a situation in which the implementation using explicit recursion is preferable as it is easier to reason about?

                    <span>I am trying (with the blessing of the cabal maintainers and the haskell foundation) to spearhead an initiative to re-vamp the cabal documentation. Right now it is a combination of reference material, and a user guide. It would be nice to have a beginner friendly, linear guide that walks a newcomer through the most common use cases of cabal.
 I am trying to keep on top of the issue tracker and provide plenty of context. The first three sections have all their required chapters recorded in the issue tracker https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/issues
 I plan on adding the more advanced chapters as issues later, but if anyone feels especially strongly about contributing those it would be greatly appreciated. They can be found in the SUMMARY.md https://github.com/haskell/cabal-userguide/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md
 I want this project to be friendly to beginner contributors, so if you want to take an issue and learn as you write it, I would love that and will be happy to offer any guidance I can (as well as coercing more senior cabal contributors to offer input).
 Thanks everyone, I think this is a really important initiative to improve the haskell ecosystem for the uninitiated and the old guard alike!

                    <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m seeing weird behavior with this implementation of open tracing as it&#x27;s not producing fully isolated spans (some spans are combining together). My theory is that this is from the context switching between threads in the ExecutionContext but would really appreciate any nudges in the right direction. 
 Below is the code I&#x27;ve written so far https://scastie.scala-lang.org/DZCCyl8WRoOBgeragoDbXQ

                    <span>Is there a way to examine the LLVM IR generated by scala native?
 I ran the sample template project listed here - https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/sbt.html#minimal-sbt-project and got a bunch of ll files - 0.ll, 1.ll, 2.ll, etc each of which seems to contain obfuscated LLVM IR. Is it meant to look like this and be unreadable?
 I can see that there is a Main.NIR file (as expected). Do I need to convert the NIR to LLVM IR in some way?

                    <span>Age 
 http4s - 7 years
 http4k - 1 year
 
 Website 
 http4s - bare bone
 http4k - looks like a microsite, but still provides some confidence.
 
 Features and integrations 
 http4s - bare bone. Almost 0 integrations.
 http4k - well equiped with provided modules for telemetry, resilience, oauth, aws, chaos engineering, cloud native support etc.
 
 Documentation 
 http4s - Incomplete to the point of missing a lot of FAQ type use cases.
 http4k - Well rounded documentation covering most common and upcoming use cases like resilience, rpc, graphql, telemetry.
 
 Prerequisites 
 http4s - Decent understanding of Cats, fs2, Free&#x27;s is a must.
 http4k - Well... read the documentation.
 
  
And this is when we compare http4s which is quite mature scala project to a new project like http4k. So... why ?

                    <span>This post describes how to use OBazl to
build OCaml projects with Bazel.
Compared to the first OCaml ruleset published in
2016, which contains only a few basic rules, OBazl is under active development
and aims to provide highly granular, low-level control over the build, and
eventually automatically generate build files.
It is therefore a practical choice to enjoy Bazel’s incremental, parallel,
cacheable and remote building capacities.
However, it is in its early stages, requiring manual work for some tasks that
will be automated in the future.
To exemplify its usage, I will show how to convert the build of the
uri package to Bazel. Since OCaml and
Bazel is not a frequent combination, I will give an introduction to Bazel, as
well as some aspects of compiling OCaml modules.

 I start emacs. I don&#x27;t know lisp so I&#x27;ve tried copying and editing a few examples I found on the net:
 http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_env_var_paths.html
 but nothing seems to work.
 I would appreciate any help.
 Thanks

                    <span>i believe there&#x27;s builtin help documentation on keymaps (in evil mode). i&#x27;ve scoured the internet to find information about especially the  leader combinations. i&#x27;ve become a fan of this leader key shortcuts. but the thing is i cant find documentation that covers it.
 i&#x27;ve tried  h f &quot;map!&quot; ; but that spits out elisp! what&#x27;s the command to discover these bindings?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup emacs for develop using Dart. I&#x27;ve already installed Flutter &amp; Dart on my system, so I&#x27;m trying to setup lsp-dart.
 This is my init.el file:
 ;; Install use-package (condition-case nil (require &#x27;use-package) (file-error (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (package-initialize) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;use-package) (require &#x27;use-package))) (use-package lsp-mode :ensure t) (use-package lsp-dart :ensure t :hook (dart-mode . lsp)) ;; Optional packages (use-package projectile :ensure t) ;; project management (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (yas-global-mode)) ;; snippets (use-package lsp-ui :ensure t) ;; UI for LSP (use-package company :ensure t) ;; Auto-complete ;; Optional Flutter packages (use-package hover :ensure t) ;; run app from desktop without emulator 
 which I copy-pasted from the emacs-lsp&#x27;s github page.
 The problem is that I retrieve this error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-dart: Package ‘lsp-dart-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Failed to install projectile: Package ‘projectile-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): Cannot load projectile 
 and I cannot figure how to resolve it. 
 I&#x27;ve tried to install projectile using M-x package-install RET projectile RET (after enabling MELPA), but I get an error saying that projectile-2.3.0 cannot be found, while the MELPA website says that the projectile current version is 2.4.0.
 ​
 What am I missing?

                    <span>Sorry if this is a dumb question! How can I edit lines in a *xref* buffer containing grep results? I&#x27;m looking for something like pressing &quot;e&quot; in Occur buffer.
 There is a key binding &quot;r&quot;, but I find it only applies to the search text instead of the entire line. Am I missing something?

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to hear about the layouts you&#x27;ve selected, particularly the placement of modifiers to be harmonious with Emacs keystrokes.
 Background, for normal, sane people who don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about:
 One rabbit-hole on the edge of the custom / mechanical keyboard world is minimizing the number of keys so your fingers never have to stray far from the home row. Some boards, like the Ferris, have only 34 or 36 keys so you are never more than one key away.
 These keyboards make heavy use of &#x27;layers&#x27; - additional custom &#x27;modifier&#x27; keys you hold down to generate numbers, symbols, arrow and function keystrokes etc..
 For this, keys do double-duty where tapping generates a character, but holding down applies a modifier. E.g. you may have shift on F, so tapping F makes an f character, but holding it down while tapping another key it applies shift to that other key. This is referred to as &quot;home row modifiers&quot;. Typically you&#x27;d make it symmetrical, with J as another shift, so you can use opposing hands for modifier and keystroke.
 But with Emacs, you often type modifier-key sequences that travel around the keyboard, like C-x C-k, for which alternating hands would be awkward. So I&#x27;m interested in the directions people have gone with their own keymap and what they&#x27;ve settled on.
 I&#x27;m playing with a Ferris Sweep, developing my own keymap, mostly as a &#x27;game&#x27; in my spare time, but it may yet work out and become my working keyboard. I&#x27;m thinking of having Ctrl on a thumb just to deal with these Emacs sequences.

                    <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m asking the impossible:
 Does anyone have any Emacs configs that would make Emacs so easy to use, that normal people like my partner would be able to utilize it for their daily TODO lists?
 I&#x27;m talking GUI friendly options, sane normal people keyboard shortcut choices, and even the ability to totally ignore normal Emacs regular keybindings.
 I ask because I was showing off what Org Mode could do, but was told that it looked too complicated to use.
 Does anyone have any links to some super-easy-to-use user-friendly Emacs configs that would be mouse and GUI based? (I know, its sacrilege but hey, gotta try somehow).
 I know Emacs without a config has the context menu which is fine, but yeah, looking for some tips in this department. This person was debating using it for TODO lists for work, and also maybe for writing scripts for TV shows, etc.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hey guys. It looks like OpenAI is collaborating with GitHub on their GPT stuff, so any assistance in building an editor in emacs would be greatly appreciated. I made a start 4 months ago, link below:
  
https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el/
 https://copilot.github.com/
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;27676266
  
I am looking for some help bundling this up as an emacs package and ongoing work on connecting GPT-j (and others) to various emacs libraries.
 I personally believe GPT-3+vscode is an emacs killer. That is not the view of everybody here. But I believe emacs is a much better platform for building this stuff, so please help! Thanks.

                    <span>I was playing around with fancy record libaries and was very impressed with how well labels can infer types. Probably because it avoids unnecessary complexity and less-frequently-used operations.
 So I wanted to try how much unnecessary complexity and infrequently operations I could throw on top of it while maintaining reasonable type inference. Going back-and-forth between tuples and hlists mostly works but I ran into some troubles with the union operation.
 union:: (IsHList a l, IsHList b r, IsHList c (Concat l r)) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c -- infers nicely union l r -- infers nicely union l _ :: (&quot;foo&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bi&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bar&quot; :&#x3D; Int, &quot;baz&quot; :&#x3D; Double) -- uh oh union _ r :: (&quot;foo&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bi&quot; :&#x3D; String, &quot;bar&quot; :&#x3D; Int, &quot;baz&quot; :&#x3D; Double) 
 The blame lies with this type family implementation which recurses on the first argument:
 type family Concat l r where Concat &#x27;[] a &#x3D; a Concat (x &#x27;: xs) a &#x3D; x &#x27;: Concat xs a 
 I found a way to make it work by going through type classes. If someone wants to try for themselves, here is a test case:
 l :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2] l &#x3D; Proxy r :: Proxy &#x27;[3,4] r &#x3D; Proxy cat :: IConcat a b c &#x3D;&gt; Proxy a -&gt; Proxy b -&gt; Proxy c cat _ _ &#x3D; Proxy c1 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] c1 &#x3D; cat l _ -- _ :: Proxy &#x27;[3,4] c2 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] c2 &#x3D; cat _ r -- _ :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2] c3 &#x3D; cat l r -- c3 :: Proxy &#x27;[1,2,3,4] 
 And here is my solution https://gist.github.com/Tarmean/fc553829a044979e9c5c8b4d226270b1
 You might notice that my solutions is an ugly pile of hacks. Does anyone know of a cleaner/less silly solution?

 How can I use uniqueness in Haskell as contructor?

                    <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working through Types and Programming Languages by Pierce lately and really enjoying it. Throughout the book you work through the theory and implementation of the lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus and it&#x27;s variants (including System F). However as far as the implementation of these languages go you only go as far as implementing type checkers and parsers to form ASTs in OCaml (translating the code in the book to Haskell is fairly easy). 
 I&#x27;m interested in learning more about how functional languages like Haskell are compiled to something lower level in the real world, different techniques used for memory and speed optimisations often talked about on this subreddit, how to &quot;desugar&quot; syntax into it&#x27;s core IR language (like system F) prior to compiling it to something lower level.. all that jazz.. I&#x27;ve considered picking up a book/course on compilers however a lot of them have an inclination towards compiling imperative and OO languages which I have no interest in doing. I came across this http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/ which seems to match up to exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. However I can see it&#x27;s been discontinued or the author has other priorities at the moment.
 Is there an alternative to Write You a Haskell? Or something that can at least serve as a complement to TAPL? I&#x27;m interested in learning more about LLVM if that option is available since it&#x27;s interesting to me that some modern languages like Rust are compiled to/with LLVM.
 I&#x27;m aware of this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-implementation-of-functional-programming-languages/ however fear it may be outdated. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.
 Cheers

                    <span>I&#x27;m starting a small actor oriented project in Typed Akka and was thinking of possibly using this as an excuse to update my knowledge by doing the project in Scala 3. I noticed that the official quick start giter8 template akka/akka-quickstart-scala.g8 uses Scala version 2.13.1 
 I have attempted to add Akka dependencies to the Scala 3 template scala/scala3.g8 and also attempted to change the Scala version number in the Akka template but both result in unresolved dependencies and failed to build.
 Is there a way to get Scala 3 and Typed Akka up and running with current versions (I saw an older unofficial template from 2019 using Dotty but nothing more recent)?
 If I must I can postpone using Scala 3 to a later project. It is more vital that this use Akka than that it use Scala 3.

                    <span>I am developing an MVP for a SaaS product as a progressive web app hosted on Firebase at the request of a VC. As I get started I am reminded why I f**king hate TypeScript/JavaScript so much. I&#x27;d say between not being that good at FE to begin with and having to manage dumb error messages I am losing velocity. I&#x27;d love to develop this in Scala.JS and Laminar as it’s so much simpler and I already know Scala fairly well, but I am worried that if when the MVP needs to scale and onboard new developers I will have trouble finding any. Should I just suck it up and use React? Part of me feels like I am putting the cart in front of the horse worrying about what will happen if this product will get funding when it hasn&#x27;t yet.

                    <span>I&#x27;m playing around with readability when reading large blocks of text in emacs, and sometimes the lines kind of blur together for me when I&#x27;m reading. I think coloring each sentence a different color would help me keep track of my place without needing to actively highlight each line. As far as I can tell, the only way to do this is with some implementation of faces. However, it looks like each face is assigned to a single color, so I would have to figure out how to switch to a different face for each sentence in a paragraph. The fact that I&#x27;m doing all of this within org-mode kinda complicates things too, since I only want this to apply to paragraphs, not other elements.
 Has anyone else attempted to do anything similar to this? Is there a better way to approach this?

                    <span>Hey, I started today to create my emacs config. I&#x27;m following the Emacs from scratch series from System Crafters in youtube. 
 I want to have the same mappings I have on Neovim. I&#x27;m using general.el and my leader key is the spacebar. And I want to map spacebar to do fuzzy search, so by just pressing double spacebar I&#x27;m searching for a file (similar to doom-emacs amd what I have on my neovim config). 
 Can&#x27;t figure what is the syntax for mapping the spacebar. For setting the leader key, using SPC worked, but doesn&#x27;t work for mapping spacebar after the prefix. 
 Here&#x27;s how I have defined my leader key.
 (use-package general :config (general-evil-setup t) (general-create-definer rune/leader-keys :global-prefix &quot;SPC&quot;)) 
 And here are the mappings I have:
 (rune/leader-keys &#x27;normal &quot;b&quot; &#x27;(:ignore b :which-key &quot;buffers&quot;) &quot;bb&quot; &#x27;(counsel-switch-buffer :which-key &quot;all buffers&quot;) &quot;bs&quot; &#x27;(save-buffer :which-key &quot;save buffer&quot;) &quot;bq&quot; &#x27;(kill-current-buffer :which-key &quot;quit buffer&quot;) &quot;/&quot; &#x27;(swiper :which-key &quot;search in buffer&quot;)) 
 What I have tried:
 &quot;SPC&quot; &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) &quot;&quot; &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) 
 That last one I tried:
 (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) &#x27;(counsel-fzf :which-key &quot;search file&quot;) 
 Those don&#x27;t work, can anyone point me in the right direction ? Thanks.

                    <span>Does anyone know how to make the side scrolling wheel scroll left/right? To be specific, I have the Logitech MX 3 mouse which has both a scroll wheel for vertical and horizontal scrolling. While I know that learning the keybindings is a good idea (don&#x27;t worry I already know them), it is nice to actually have the mouse work in the one would it expect it should. I did check out Xah&#x27;s blog on mouse configuration, but he doesn&#x27;t mention this. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Greetings Emacslings,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to get company-mode to only trigger completion on tab. This is my set up, which does pretty much what I want:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package company :defer t :diminish &quot;&quot; :hook ((prog-mode) . (lambda () (company-mode))) :config (setq tab-always-indent &#x27;complete) (setq company-idle-delay nil) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3) :bind (:map company-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . &#x27;company-indent-or-complete-common) :map company-active-map (&quot;C-n&quot; . &#x27;company-select-next-or-abort) (&quot;C-j&quot; . &#x27;company-select-next-or-abort) (&quot;C-p&quot; . &#x27;company-select-previous-or-abort) (&quot;C-k&quot; . &#x27;company-select-previous-or-abort)))
 (use-package company-prescient :defer t :hook (company-mode . company-prescient-mode)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The only problem now is that yasnippets are borked up: tab triggers company, which doesn&#x27;t test to see if it can expand as yasnippet first. Is there any way for me to get this working how I&#x27;d like?
 Edit: better minimal example

Basically, I am working in a very bright environment and dark themes make it quite difficult to see anything. However, in light themes, all of the equations are a faint light color that blend in too much with the light background (I am using the gui mode)
 I am looking for something that is
  
Light theme: something that looks good on gui mode
 Code in math mode is dark, contrasting the light background
  
Thank you for your time.

                    <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for a long time but my needs are not that fancy so my understanding of it is not that great. I&#x27;m mostly using it to edit DNS (bind) and configuration files. 
 I have for a long time had this peculiar thing come up. In most of my dns zone files the TAB key acts as I want, ie when you press TAB the cursor moves 8 characters to the right, (from position 1) when you move the marker with arrow left it jumps back to position 1, and if you press TAB again it jumps 8 characters to the right again.
 But in some files when I press TAB the marker moves to something like position 16. Now when you press arrow left the marker goes to the left as if the space is filled with spaces. If you try to press TAB again nothing happens.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to read the documentation on how to program the TAB key but I haven&#x27;t been able to solve the problem.

I know about lsp-org but that seems to only work with editing inside the actual org file and it seems wonky at best (flycheck detecting things outside source block). This is for python with lsp-pyright. I&#x27;m also wondering if the special org src buffer has a hook on closing or something. I want to run my python black command when I close the src buffer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working like it does in my normal files. This the package I&#x27;m using: https://github.com/pythonic-emacs/blacken

                    <span>Hi, is there a package that displays the distance number from the cursor position above every character of the current line? It would be useful because it would be possible to move the cursor exactly in the position of a specific character using a evil-mode shortcut, pressing a number and h/l to move right or left a specific number of times. I have yet the distance from current line for every line, using linum, but i think that even this feature would be useful.

                    <span>I get the following stack backtrace when using Emacs for windows built as such. 
 Digging deeper, this is the lisp form that is causing problems:
  (desktop-create-buffer 208 &quot;c:/Users/thequ/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.el&quot; &quot;.emacs.el&quot; &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode &#x27;(eldoc-mode override-global-mode global-auto-revert-mode flx-ido-mode dired-omit-mode auto-complete-mode) 35 &#x27;(1 nil) nil nil &#x27;((buffer-display-time 24790 5102 984406 0) (buffer-file-coding-system . undecided-dos)) &#x27;((mark-ring (36)))) 
 and it is the dired-omit-mode part of this lisp form that is barfing. 
 I think I will remove this form from the desktop records to get it to work. But if you could explain why this happened and how to fix it, I would appreciate it.

                    <span>Underscores and dashes are treated as word breaks so when I use the evil commands like dw to delete a word such as abc-abc-abc I have type 5cw instead of just cw.
 Can this setting be configured?
 I don&#x27;t mind some code which can change the configuration on the fly, perhaps I can use Cw for cases when I want to see dashes as regular letters of a word and use cw for the standard usage.

                    <span>I just installed and configured “vanilla” Emacs today with standard Emacs keybindings as they remind me of my old Wordstar and Word Perfect days on MS-DOS. I’m not a coder or programmer. I write and edit legal documents for a living. I have installed a dark theme and some add-ons.
 I’ve started using it for its text editing capabilities, but I am impressed with its extensible features as well. It has now become my go-to for most html browsing and I also browse Gemini capsules and Gopher holes with it. I really like the file manager, built-in terminal (I use a lot of tui apps out of preference), multimedia and internet radio support, org-mode which I am using to write unit meeting agendas, as well as the built in games.
 I’m looking for suggestions for additional extensions that work with my use case as I would like to use Emacs for the majority of my workflow rather than rely on multiple tui and GUI applications. Additional game recommendations would be welcome as well.
 Emacs seems like an another OS within my OS (I use Fedora at home and when I telework).
 Initially I thought that Emacs would be “too hard and complicated” but I have enjoyed the tutorial and documentation. I feel like I am just scratching the surface.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to write a small GHC extension to get my hands on GHC hacking. As suggested by the GHC gitlab wiki, I started off by having a look at this article by SPJ and SM to get a feel for GHC&#x27;s architecture.
 I now have an idea for what I think would be a relatively small GHC extension that I would like to have a crack at as a first attempt at actually modifying GHC&#x27;s source code: CoercibleStrings. The outcome would be similar in spirit to that of the existing OverloadedStrings GHC extension, however, the latter I believe &quot;only&quot; infers the type (Data.String.IsString a) &#x3D;&gt; a for a string literal l during type checking and then desugars them to fromString l, where fromString :: (Data.String.IsString a) &#x3D;&gt; String -&gt; a is from the typeclass Data.String.IsString.

                    <span>I am interested on the state of Haskell (server side and back-end more specifically). I have seen some git repos that provide some bindings in C in order to execute Haskell on Swift. 
 Is it possible to have Haskell on the Backend and Swift on the frontend? Are the efforts not worth it?

                    <span>Hi all ... I&#x27;ve been playing with Haskell on Ubuntu (20.04, Focal), having recently installed it with the command &quot;sudo apt-get install haskell-platform&quot;. ghci seems to work fine, but anything I try compiling with ghc gives a linker error.
 For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; $ ghc hello.hs
 [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( hello.hs, hello.o ) Linking hello ... /usr/bin/ld.gold: fatal error: hello: Input/output error collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc&#x27; failed in phaseLinker&#x27;. (Exit code: 1) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 hello.hs is this program:
 haskell main &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Hello, World!&quot; 
 Any idea how I can get this to compile?

                    <span>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-replicant-0.1.0.1
 This is my second Haskell library. It is a low-level library that creates a logical replication slot and streams changes to your program from your PostgreSQL server.
 It&#x27;s still experimental and ready for library authors and interested hackers to kick the tires and build real-time applications with it.
 Future plans include: - handling user-defined types - libraries based on conduit and other popular streaming packages
 Thanks for taking a look. And thanks to this community. I built this library from scratch on my stream and am grateful for those who&#x27;ve been watching and cheering me on. This is a library I&#x27;ve wanted for a while and I hope you enjoy it too!

                    <span>I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a way to convert a tuple into a &quot;type map&quot;.
 Example:
  val t: (Int, (String, Double)) &#x3D; (3, (&quot;Pi&quot;, 3.14)) val m &#x3D; toTypeMap(t) val i: Int &#x3D; m.get[Int] // returns 3 val s: String &#x3D; m.get[String] // returns &quot;Pi&quot; val d: Double &#x3D; m.get[Double] // returns 3.14 
 toTypeMap(t) should only compile if t contains no duplicate types, i.e. wouldn&#x27;t compile for an (Int, Int). Calling get[T] should only compile if the tuple contains the type T. 
 Perhaps &quot;type map&quot; is not the canonical name for this. What I&#x27;m thinking of is something like ZIO&#x27;s Env, basically a Map that lets you retrieve elements based on the type of the element.
 edit: the tuple doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be &quot;nested&quot;

 WIP Roguelike
 I&#x27;ve made a little roguelike starter kit for Indigo to do some of the heavy lifting.
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit
 In truth I hope to stay ahead of the tutorial to make sure the starter kit has all the tools needed for anyone else having a go. I have to make sure it works somehow!
 You can follow my own progress here and use it as a reference if it helps:

 If you do have a go and get stuck, feel free to join the indigo Discord and say hello.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been unable to run the elixir shell using alchemist-iex-run because the erlang executable erl is not found in my path. Here&#x27;s the error:
  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/elixir/1.12.1/bin/elixir: line 230: exec: erl: not found Process Alchemist-IEx exited abnormally with code 127 
 In an attempt to fix this, in init.el I added:  (add-to-list &#x27;exec-path &quot;/opt/homebrew/bin&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;exec-path &quot;/opt/homebrew/sbin&quot;) 
 But this still doesn&#x27;t work. Here&#x27;s the result from...
 vterm echo $PATH
 Includes the added homebrew paths.
 (exec-path) Includes the added homebrew paths.
 (call-process &quot;ENV&quot; nil t) Does not include the added homebrew paths.
 Erlang shell: os:cmd(&quot;echo $PATH&quot;). Does not include the added homebrew paths. But does add its own path to erl: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/erlang/24.0.2_1/lib/erlang/erts-12.0.2/bin.
 How do correctly set that path so that the homebrew paths always appear?

                    <span>I never used EXWM, but if I&#x27;m not wrong it allows you to switch between different workspaces, where each workspace has its own frame configuration. For instance, I can do a vertical split in workspace 1, than move to workspace 2 which will be a new empty frame, not vertically splitted. Then, if I want I can move back to workspace 1 and find again the vertical split and the buffers opened in that workspace. I didn&#x27;t manage to find anything similar to this for regular Emacs, every time I want to open a new empty frame without changing the configuration of the frame I&#x27;m currently using, I need to open a new Emacs X window, while I would like to do everything in the same Emacs window. Why you don&#x27;t just use EXWM, you might ask. Because for now I&#x27;m quite skeptical about its usefulness for me, so I want to take my time to understand if it&#x27;s something that might actually improve my workflow. In the meanwhile, I would really love a feature like the one described above. I started only very recently to use Emacs so sorry if the feature I&#x27;m looking for is something obvious or basic. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with emacs for a few days, mainly with org-mode, and I really like it and the idea of it. But, I&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface. I thought a way for me to get into using emacs would be learning a new language, and looked into C++. I found this great guide for using C++ with emacs, but frankly I&#x27;m a bit intimidated by how many extensions and how much configuration are required. It makes me want to just use a more standard IDE.
 I guess I have two questions for more experienced users: 1. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is coding with emacs at odds with using an IDE, and I should be looking at a different work flow entirely, rather than forcing emacs to have ide like features? 2. What sort of stands out for folks as the reason it was worth climbing up the emacs learning curve?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to set up lsp-mode to work with clangd, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any instructions anywhere. I&#x27;m under the impression that it&#x27;s supposed to just work, and I have a hook set up for c++ mode, but the result is lsp[disconnected] and no actual attempt to connect to clangd. Is there something else I need to do? clangd is on my path so it should be easy to find.

                    <span>As the title indicates, I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble finding the source files for the Elisp functions. Specifically, when I&#x27;m attempting to call
 M-x xref-find-definitions 
 in any buffer of any major mode. For example, running that function on 
 xref-find-definitions 
 in the info buffer causes emacs to return with
 Find definitions of (default xref-find-definitions): 
 so we hit  and are shown 
 Visit tags table (default TAGS): /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info 
 hit that  again and we get 
 File /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info/TAGS does not exist 
 (note that running 
 xref-etags-mode 
 doesn&#x27;t change anything)
 now I&#x27;m aware this has to do something with the &#x27;etags&#x27; shell command, but this only creates a tags table in a specific working directory. How would I configure so that I have a global tags table so that anywhere I could run 
 xref-find-definitions 
 and go take a look at the course code of a function?
 Thanks

                    <span>I am having a hard time getting consult-line to make matches with just orderless-regexp. The instructions at https://github.com/oantolin/orderless/issues/31#issuecomment-763908249 are thorough but don’t seem to override my usual behavior of allowing for orderless-initialism matches, and unlike the code suggested there, I do not want any matches to be made if a regexp search fails (much like how Swiper works. My config looks like this:
 (use-package orderless :init (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless) orderless-matching-styles &#x27;(orderless-literal orderless-regexp orderless-initialism) completion-category-defaults nil) :config (orderless-define-completion-style just-regexp (orderless-matching-styles &#x27;(orderless-regexp))) (setf (alist-get &#x27;consult-location completion-category-overrides) &#x27;(styles just-regexp)) (setq orderless-style-dispatchers &#x27;(without-if-bang)) (defun without-if-bang (pattern _index _total) (cond ((equal &quot;!&quot; pattern) &#x27;(orderless-literal . &quot;&quot;)) ((string-prefix-p &quot;!&quot; pattern) &#x60;(orderless-without-literal . ,(substring pattern 1)))))) 
 Thank you for any help!

                    <span>Hey Emacs lovers, I&#x27;ve updated the top-up for the Inside Emacs videos by adding the files and commands used in the last 3 videos on org-table I uploaded recently.
 This top-up is for you if you like the videos and:
  
you want the list of the commands used in the videos,
 or you want to practice your Emacs workflow by reproducing some of the actions in the videos with the files I&#x27;ve used.
  
For instance, if you&#x27;re interested on trying the commands related to exporting tables in org-mode we discussed in Inside Emacs #6 (part 6), you can:
  
find the commands in this section of the README,
 and try them with the org file org-table.org.
  
I hope this top-up can help you reduce the time between the moment you watched the video and the moment you&#x27;re able to do what&#x27;s in the video and much more.
 If there something missing in the top-up or you think of another way of presenting it, let me know.
 Have a nice day :)

                    <span>For a Gantt from org-mode project I use SVG to create the final chart. I use the  element to add information on tasks as a pop-up.
 This works nicely in a browser but not in the native emacs SVG viewer. I tried this in emacs 27 that comes with ubuntu 21.04 and in a freshly compiled version from https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git using the master branch.
 Any ideas on if this is possible and/or how to get this to work ?
 Thanks,
 Jouke

 So I&#x27;m in an org-table and I give it a simple addition like (+ 8 $4) But it seems to be multiplying (8 * the_number_in_column4) rather than the correct behavior of (8 + the_number_in_column4). 
 I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a mistake on my part and not emacs, but I&#x27;m very interested to see where I went wrong. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance and have a great day.

                    <span>(I think I finally fixed the formatting, didn&#x27;t realize I had to go into Markdown mode)
 I&#x27;d been searching for a while for a way to do this but couldn&#x27;t find it, so yesterday I sat down and coded my own. With this function and binding, when I hit Return on a file in Dired it either opens the file asynchronously in an external command if the file format-command combo is defined in dired-guess-shell-alist-user etc., or opens the file in Emacs as usual if the format is not bound to a command.
 (defun dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command () &quot;If there is a default command defined for this file type, run it asynchronously.If not, open it in Emacs.&quot; (interactive) (let ( ;; get the default for the file type, ;; putting the string into a list because dired-guess-default throws an error otherwise. (default (dired-guess-default (cons (dired-get-filename) &#x27;()))) ;; put the file name into a list so dired-shell-stuff-it will accept it (file-list (cons (dired-get-filename) &#x27;()))) (if (null default) ;; if no default found for file, open in Emacs (dired-find-file) ;; if default is found for file, run command asynchronously (dired-run-shell-command (dired-shell-stuff-it (concat default &quot; &amp;&quot;) file-list nil))))) ;; This function is bound to the Return key in dired-mode to replace the default behavior on Return (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd &quot;&quot;) #&#x27;dired-find-file-or-do-async-shell-command) ;; For added convenience: Don&#x27;t open a new Async Shell Command window (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist(cons &quot;\\*Async Shell Command\\*.*&quot; (cons #&#x27;display-buffer-no-window nil))) ;; Always open a new buffer if default is occupied. (setq async-shell-command-buffer &#x27;new-buffer) 
 These modification more or less &quot;complete&quot; Dired for me as a file manager for everyday use without annoyance or cognitive load. The shell command and async shell command functions and keys remain available for more involved stuff like multiple files, but for 95% of my uses this is sufficient.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m currently digging through Programming in Scala - Fifth Edition. While I generally like the new control syntax, now in chapter 9.4 I realize that it does not extend to user defined control structures. E.g given
 def myscope(byNameParam : &#x3D;&gt; Unit) : Unit &#x3D; println(&quot;BEGIN&quot;) byNameParam println(&quot;END&quot;) 
 I cannot use
 myscope println(&quot;test&quot;) 
 but instead still have to use
 myscope { println(&quot;test&quot;) } 
 This is slightly annoying. Will this restriction be lifted at some point?

                    <span>Hi everyone! I’ve been using zettelkästen on and off for 1/2 years. The problem is I have both physical and digital notes, which are not integrated. 
Also I think I’ve been doing it wrong the whole time since I only noted excerpts basically.
I was wondering how to fix it.
Should I divide literature and permanent notes?
Thank you for your time</span>

Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks,

PS The notes are stored in iCloud, in a 1Writer notes folder. Don&#x27;t know if that affects things...</span>

                    <span>edit: &quot;Grokking&quot; not &quot;Groking&quot;. Sorry for the typo in the title.
 I&#x27;m trying to &quot;grok emacs&quot;. I&#x27;ve heard high praises, the enlightenment, what not. I have not found it yet. Over the years:
  
Done emacs tutorials multiple times (forget most key bindings).
 Did org-mode tutorial once and created a huge org-mode daily-notes file. Abandoned it.
 Know scheme, and have done problems in it (but otherwise an experience C and python programmer). Can comfortably read and understand basic e-lisp, but otherwise I&#x27;m an e-lisp beginner.
 Now set up doom emacs (so evil mode; I&#x27;m an experienced vim+tmux+i3wm user).
 Did emacs tutorial one last time yesterday (all of it).
 Doing an org-mode daily notes file (this time probably I&#x27;ll stick with it).
  
So yeah, as you can see I have a mixed background. I&#x27;m …</span>

                    <span>I understand the emacs way to do this is to download a package for each file type/mode and use the indent functions specific to that mode, but not every package has an &quot;un-indent&quot; or &quot;shift left&quot; function. In these cases, they seem to expect you to manually delete white space in front of the line to un-indent. Also, working all of these different indent functions into my existing keybinds is annoying.
 I have a package (github) that detects the indentation offset and updates the tab-width variable in emacs. Does anyone have a package/function that can use this variable to indent/dedent single or multiple lines?
 Thank you

 Is there a way to save the current line number of the buffer to make next emacs session of this file to open on this line number ? Or add a bunch of code in .emacs ??
 Ex: emacs journal ; editing at line 33; Ctrl-X -c;
 On minute later : emacs journal &#x3D;&#x3D; &gt; displays right on line 33

 Welcome screen (left) with SVG image and font variations converted to PS file (right)
 Here is my next iteration on basic WYSIWYG printing in GNU Emacs for Images. Now you can print Emacs Welcome screen in all its glory.
 Cavaet: Since PS only supports JPG and bitmaps for images, SVG and PNG with transparency will require manual conversion for desirable output.
  
Run M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to printer.
 Run C-u M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces to send output to file (PS format).

                    <span>Hi all! 
 I received the following notice because I was subscribed to the &#x27;Intermediate Haskell&#x27; newsletter, but thought it might be worthwhile to know for other people on Reddit as well:
  
Hey! 
 You are receiving this email because you have subscribed to updates about the &#x27;Intermediate Haskell&#x27; book. 
 The book is cancelled. Vlad and Artyom and all other contributors have switched to other things. 
 [...] 
 Anything that we write will likely be announced on Twitter: https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u&#x3D;67b31bfe9303116749c079389&amp;id&#x3D;25c6c78b9d&amp;e&#x3D;3e3ab466bb is Vlad&#x27;s, and https://intermediatehaskell.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u&#x3D;67b31bfe9303116749c079389&amp;id&#x3D;97065ee399&amp;e&#x3D;3e3ab466bb is Artyom&#x27;s. 
 Bye!
  
Writing a book is a very large and difficult ordeal, so it is not strange for a book to be cancelled and I wish the authors the best &lt;3.
 Hopefully some other work(s) will fill the gap between &#x27;beginner&#x27; and &#x27;expert&#x27; material of Haskell in the (near?) future.

                    <span>I am creating a application that will make extensive use of the GUI in the Linux environment, I am not so interested in porting to Windows at this time, though perhaps I may in the future.
 I have tried using Gtk, wxHaskell, and Fltkhs, and all of them fail during compilation now. They clearly worked in the past, but apparently are not being maintained anymore.
 Now, at this point, I am prepared to fork one of them and bring it current for LTS 18.0 (and beyond), but I would rather not have to do that, as I want to just write the application, but will if I have to.
 Can anyone please point me to a GUI framework that compiles and links flawlessly with LTS 18.0 without a fuss? And why is there so little maintenance on these GUI frameworks to begin with?
 I will also be making use of FRP in this project, and many others to come, but they so far don&#x27;t seem to suffer from the same problems, for the most part.
 I would also prefer not to have to rely on Qt, as I did for a prior (non-Haskell) project, and they yanked the part I was heavily reliant on out of Open Source, the bloody bastards! :)
 Any suggestions at this point would be extremely helpful.

                    <span>Hi,
 Does anyone have minimum example to rendering string or font using GLFW-b in Haskell OpenGL ?
 Currently, I use GLUT to render string inside My Haskell OpenGL binding project.
  import qualified Graphics.UI.GLUT as GLUT GLUT.renderString GLUT.Roman &quot;Hello World&quot; 
 ​
 ​
 here is the code to render &quot;Hello World&quot;
  preservingMatrix $ do translate (Vector3 (u/2.0) 0 0 :: Vector3 GLdouble) GL.scale (1/scaleFont :: GL.GLdouble) (1/scaleFont) 1 GL.blend $&#x3D; GL.Disabled preservingMatrix $ GLUT.renderString GLUT.Roman &quot;Hello World&quot; GL.blend $&#x3D; GL.Enabled 
 ​
 ​
 Here is my Stack dependencies 
 ​
 stack ls dependencies
 GLFW-b 3.2.1.0 OpenGL 3.0.3.0 OpenGLRaw 3.3.3.0 GLUT 2.7.0.15

 But the text is very bad and weird and hard to recognize the word.
 What I have tried so far.
 Disabled Blend when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 Disabled Lighting when rendering the string but the result is not much different.
 ​
 Here is the image you can see how bad the font is using GLUT or I did something wrong.
 Can you recognize &quot;Hello World&quot;?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve gone round and round with this issue, i.e., how to add a non-Prelude package. I like to work with org-mode babel for Haskell, i.e., without a specific project directory, just babel source blocks interacting with a non-project REPL. My Emacs non-project Haskell stuff works, I&#x27;m guessing, because it&#x27;s relies on my ~/.stack/global-project. But let&#x27;s leave that aside for now.
 So let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m just trying to get a plain-vanilla project to work with an outside package. So I create a new project with stack new basicmath And let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to get Diagrams to work just like they give with the example code here, i.e., &quot;Your First Diagram.&quot; I&#x27;m trying all the install instructions at the command prompt in .../basicmath/, none work. I&#x27;m guessing something needs to happen with the basicmath.cabal or the stack.yaml? But I look in vain for any concrete examples. Confusing to me also is whether to actually use cabal when I&#x27;m supposed to be using stack. In any case, nothing works. How exactly would I make the example code work?
 I&#x27;d eventually like to see this work on the Emacs babel side, but I won&#x27;t get greedy yet. Emacs babel is just a wrapper apparently for feeding multiple lines into a non-project global REPL, i.e., fraught.
 A really good tutorial on this would be nice to find, BTW. Most of what I&#x27;ve seen is just someone&#x27;s stream-of-consciousness hypnosis ramblings, i.e., leaving a beginner to do guess-and-test over and over. And beginner books don&#x27;t talk about it either; rather, you simply put code in a file and load it at the REPL as you work through these books. (I did find one book that walks you through a project creation. But it has no example of adding a non-Prelude package.) Would another IDE handle adding packages better? What about VS Code?

                    <span>I cannot find a thread that compare mind map with org. I use mind map since 20 years, so I saw some video from org so far. It looks really beautiful, but cannot find advantages over mindmap software. What are a couple of advantages of org over mindmap apart because is built into the fabolous emacs system?

                    <span>Hello there,
 https://github.com/overdr0ne/gumshoe
 What is it?
 Gumshoe quietly keeps tabs on your movements so you can retrace your steps if you ever need a reminder. It does not keep track of every move you make, rather, only when you exceed some minimum Euclidean distance from the last tracked position, like a leash, or when you idle in one place for a while. It is a lot like the global-mark-ring, but expanded, and a lot like Evil&#x27;s jump list, but works more generically.
 Why?
 Basically, I tend to get lost when searching around large code bases(yes, lsp and tags help a lot too), or when I’m getting lots of interruptions, or when I just sorta space out... Specifically, I made this as a replacement for Vim’s jump list which, in Evil’s implementation at least, logs only for certain evil commands-- not at all general, and just doesn’t work when you’re not using evil for movement. I found a few other movement tracking packages, and the global-mark-ring, but they were either too manual, or had bad granularity of tracking, so I made this and thought I&#x27;d share.
 Does anyone do anything similar? Comments and suggestions welcome!

 markdown-mode[2] by Jason Blevins seems not have this function.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the Pillow package. If I type:
 ​
 from PIL import Image
 pic &#x3D; Image.new(0, 0)
 pic.
 ​
 I will get completions for the Image class. However if I do: 
 pic &#x3D; Image.open(&quot;pic.png&quot;)
 Followed by &quot;pic.&quot; I get no completions. If I call company-complete it says &quot;No completion found&quot;. Why am I not getting completions after Image.open? Is it something peculiar about the open call (the doc says it doesn&#x27;t actually load the image at the time you call open)? In vscode I do get proper completions for Image class after calling Image.open. Any thoughts? Thanks.

                    <span>Suppose that I have a buffer or region with a lot of lines like these:
 [[ 1.1, -4.2 ], [ 3.14, -2.718 ]], [[ 7, 8 ], [ -10, 33 ]], 
 Suppose, for example that I&#x27;d like to multiply each number by 777. What is the simplest way to achieve this?
 By simplest way, I mean writing no (or very little amount of) lisp code. Maybe there is an already existing package which solves the same (or similar) problem.
 One way I see is to convert this into an org table, and use org&#x27;s table capabilities to apply the math formula. But then I lose the format of the original buffer (I mean []&#x27;s, etc.). Losing the format is not a huge problem, but it would be better if the formatting was retained.

                    <span>For those (few?) of you running Fedora Silverblue, it might have happened that you lose track of which Emacs instance belongs to which toolbox container. 
 I came up with this code (feedback welcomed!) that I added to the :config section of my (use-package emacs...) block:
 (defvar hoagie-container-name nil &quot;Stores the name of the current container, if present.&quot;) (when (file-exists-p &quot;/run/.containerenv&quot;) ;; from http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_read_file_content.html ;; insert content in temp buffer rather than open a file (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents &quot;/run/.containerenv&quot;) (search-forward &quot;name&#x3D;&quot;) ;; move point to the line with the name (setq hoagie-container-name (cl-subseq (thing-at-point &#x27;line) 6 -2)))) ;; Identify the toolbox container for this Emacs instance in the frame title (setq frame-title-format &#x27;(&quot; %b @ &quot; (:eval hoagie-container-name)) icon-title-format &#x27;(&quot; %b @ &quot; (:eval hoagie-container-name)))) 
 I removed from my frame parameters (undecorated . t) for this. It could go in the modeline too, probably in misc-info: (push &#x27;(:eval hoagie-container-name) mode-line-misc-info).

 I haven&#x27;t gotten any groups to show up on the modeline. I&#x27;m not even sure how to test that the demon is running correctly with or without the notify package.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for two months now, for org-mode mostly and because I like Gnu projects. I haven&#x27;t learned Lisp yet and I&#x27;ve tried to customize Emacs Vanilla by reading and adding other people&#x27;s code. 
 This is my init.el and I&#x27;m going to add more code later, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s well written but until now I&#x27;ve got no errors and everything seems to work correctly.
 There is one thing at the moment that I still haven&#x27;t figured out. I would like to set a light theme for the org-mode buffer and keep the dark background for the other modes. 
 How would you modify my code to achieve this?

                    <span>I use org and org-roam v2 fairly extensively, and I&#x27;ve started thinking a little about how I might track some quantified-self metrics to play around with. 
 An example of this kind-of setup is Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s, detailed here: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/
 Or more generally: https://quantifiedself.com/
 I want to start tracking little aspects of myself in an open format, ideally co-located with my other notes. It&#x27;s fairly important that I can query the data I&#x27;m storing so that I can look for interesting bits of data or trends.
 A MVP of this might be a random prompt for a handful of questions: * How do you feel right now? 0-3 * How energetic do you feel right now? 0-3
 How might y&#x27;all implement something like this? Appending answers to a table using org-capture templates perhaps? Any tips or tricks? Have you implemented anything that rhymes with my thinking here?

                    <span>English is not my first language, so I hope I can describe my problem reasonably well, since I found it kind of hard to do even in my native language :D
 I have a toy project in Scala 3 and JavaFX. Not bad, but writing JavaFX in code is quite verbose, and FXML is even worse. So I thought I could devise a small dsl then expand it as I go, very similar to the builder pattern example on the Scala 3 reference. For example, I would like to write
 hbox { label { text &#x3D; &quot;Label&quot; } tableView[TestItem] { items ++&#x3D; Seq( TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;A&quot;)), TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;B&quot;)), TestItem(jfxProperty.SimpleStringProperty(&quot;C&quot;)) ) tableColumn[TestItem, String] { text &#x3D; &quot;Column&quot; cellValueFactory[TestItem, String](_.getValue.a) } } }

 I have made a very small project : https://github.com/dionesh12/ETLFramework.
 If anyone could go through it and recommend as to how i should improve or should i quit while i am ahead if its really bad i will be extremely grateful

                    <span>I have been a python programmer for over a decade.
 I ventured into the world of scala a couple of years ago when I went in search for a better faster programming language and fell in love with functional programming. Now I work quite a lot in Scala.
 And yet, the ease of python is undeniable. So I was wondering if there was a way to call scala programs from python like you can do with c modules (with pybind for instance).
 I ran into ScalaPy but this does the opposite ie. It enables calling python routines from scala. I am looking for the opposite.
 I figured ScalaNative would perhaps enable this since this does not depend on JVM. Futhermore, I guess it is also faster then Scala. Can any one point me in the right direction?

                    <span>Hi All, In Scala, I am trying understand the usage of companion object for class, trait and case class . All I know is by using the companion object with we can access the private methods and variables of companion object and can access in class/trait/case class . I want to organize my code based on the features provided by them but not sure how. For example, I am writing all my utility methods in object and service method in classes which is fine but end up writing too many functions in object(for utilities). From the real time application development perspective how can we take advantage of the features of companion object, case class, class and trait to organize the code.
 And is there additional features/ difference for the companion object across those three

                    <span>Super glad to be part of this community of top-level researchers! Hope to become as good as you soon.
I have a couple of questions, however;
I don&#x27;t want to start with a digital zettelkasten, so I&#x27;ve started the process of acquiring a novelink box and index cards from Amazon. But info online is considerably vague. I know I&#x27;m to use my fleeting notes for quick ideas or notes as they come, then my literature note is for learning purposes before transferring to my permanent note, then finally transfer singular ideas into my zettels. My question is how do I use this while reading a book or taking an online course? What do I need to transfer between these notes? How do I know I&#x27;m taking the ideal note? Do I look at it from the context of why I&#x27;m studying the note/book/course, or I&#x27;m to maintain an open mind?
Also, I don&#x27;t know if there are copywriters in this group, but how can I use this method to boost my research ability? How do you use your zettelkasten system to research?
Thanks for your answers!</span>

                    <span>What are the main differences between org-reveal (the one that&#x27;s still maintained) and org-re-reveal?
 Is one better/easier to use? I&#x27;ve only used org-reveal because that seems to be the most recommended/popular, and it works mostly fine, though I find the documentation rather poor.

                    <span>I am currently trying kotllin for competitive programming and I need a new file for each new problem. However lsp-mode keeps telling me &quot;Conflicting declarations: public val OUTPUT: PrintStream!, public val OUTPUT: PrintStream!.&quot; for every global variable or function (OUTPUT is defined both in A/main.kt and B/main.kt). Is there a way to bypass this? If not, then I probably need to run different language server for every problem file/directory. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do that. Is there an option to specify project root while starting lsp-mode?

                    <span>Following the variable help for notmuch-fcc-dirs
 &gt; If ‘notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert’ is set (the default) then
 &gt; the header should be of the form &quot;folder +tag1 -tag2&quot; where
 &gt; folder is the folder (relative to the notmuch mailstore) to store
 &gt; the message in, and tag1 and tag2 are tag changes to apply to the
 &gt; stored message.
 I have the following line:
 notmuch-fcc-dirs &#x27;((&quot;.*&quot; . &quot;sent -unread&quot;))
 To save my mail in sent and remove the unread tag. However when I send an email it asks me if I want to create the directory and it creates &#x27;sent -unread&#x27;. As opposed to creating &#x27;sent&#x27; and removing the tag unread. notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert is set to t.
 If I remove the -unread it works fine. Is my syntax wrong?
 Thanks.

                    <span>When I have to decrypt a file using gpg, I can&#x27;t use the Emacs shell buffer, because it is a dumb shell that cannot handle interactive prompt. 
 To solve this, I use the term mode for any interactive command. But is there any ways to use Emacs shell to enter gpg passphase?
 I have read some materials about pinentry-emacs. However, most of them are outdated.

                    <span>Hello guys! how are yall doing?
 Well I am a new user to emacs, I use a lot of text editing, mainly VSCODE and mainly with git. 
 I am currently facing an issue with Magit and I wanna ask you if you can point me out to a solution as I already did some research but found nothing.
 So, I have a repo cloned using HTTPS protocol. I can push new branches to origin normally using the command &quot;git push origin [branch-name]&quot;.
 Now when I try to push my branch using magit, (P u - type the upstream branch name - [RET]) I am getting:
 (fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
 Please make sure you have the correct access rights
 and the repository exists.)
 I found some people having issues like this one but when using SSH protocol for their repos, but in my case as, I said, I am using HTTPS protocol and it works normally using terminal.
 If you can point me out to a solution for this issue I would appreciate it :)
 the log shows me this...
 git … push -v --set-upstream [my-branch]\:refs/heads/
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi
 Working in Windows emacs 27.2
 I would love to use the functionality of radio targets in my org file. If you dont know it see: https://orgmode.org/manual/Radio-Targets.html
 Therefore I have heading * dictionary &gt;&gt; bla blub * my org text Text mydefinition is then highlighted as link.
 Now the problem
 When I klick the link on mydefinition. I would expect it to jump to the position of &gt;&gt; 
 Instead emacs pops a file dialog and asks for &quot;Visit TAGS table&quot;
 Generating TAGS files seems rocket science to me and Documentation is really scattered and not consistent at all for this. For windows even worse. Does anybody use this? Is it outdated functionality or could it be configured to just work out of the box? Does it work on linux without special installations?
 Thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;ve set up emacs for python using python-language-server and lsp. When I open a python file, the top line of emacs shows the directory elements and the file name. The file name will have a squiggly line under it if the file is not formatted correctly. But also the directory elements have squiggly lines under them (whether or not the file name does). Sometimes they go away, but I&#x27;m not sure what I do that makes them go away. What do the squiggly lines under the directory elements mean and how to make them go away? Thanks

                    <span>Hi all,
 Major noob here looking for some pointers on their first project. The aim of the project is to pull data down from multiple entity&#x27;s public REST APIs (let&#x27;s call them cryptocurrency exchanges). For each entity, I have to make numerous individual API calls without breaching that entity&#x27;s API rate limit. The aim is to execute the API pulls from each of these entities in parallel/concurrently in order to save time. I have everything working now using parallel collections, but this is non-optimal because 1. CPU is underutilized on each thread because the bulk of the time is spent waiting between API calls and 2. more entities in parallel mean more cores.
 Could someone advise me on the best way to tackle this with a concurrency based approach? 
 If possible, I would also like to keep the project structure close to what I have now. Each entity is represented by an object that extends a trait called Entity. The trait contains a method called getData that executes all the HTTP requests that are needed for that specific entity, waiting a specific amount of time between calls to avoid breaching the entity&#x27;s rate limit. Each implementation overrides an apiLimit value as well as other functions for handling the specific entities HTTP responses.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>This is easily unnoticed in the new Scala 3 documentation and I think its worth a shout out:
  
Scala 2&#x27;s somewhat puzzling behavior with respect to ambiguity has been exploited to implement the analogue of a &quot;negated&quot; search in implicit resolution, where a query Q1 fails if some other query Q2 succeeds and Q1 succeeds if Q2 fails. With the new cleaned up behavior these techniques no longer work. But there is now a new special type scala.util.NotGiven which implements negation directly. For any query type Q, NotGiven[Q] succeeds if and only if the implicit search for Q fails.

                    <span>Introduction
 When I saw opaque types and inline methods, I quickly thook about type-level assertions evaluated at compile time. I was pretty hyped by this idea so I made Iron.
 Iron uses Dotty&#x27;s inline and opaque types to create almost zero-overhead (and true zero-overhead for the next Scala 3 release) type constraints for Scala. It also supports runtime constraints.
 Actually, Iron is almost full-vanilla (By vanilla I mean &quot;without macro/black magic&quot;). Inline methods, implicit conversions and opaque types are powerful enough to use them for 90% of the library. Thank you Dotty.
 Usage
 Passing a value A to a parameter/variable/return requiring a Constrained[A, B] will (using a given method) implicitly get a Constraint[A, B] (alias: &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt;[A, B]) and use Constraint#assert. If the result is false, a compile time error is thrown.
 Example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala import io.github.iltotore.iron., constraint., numeric.constraint.*
 inline def log(x: Double &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Greater[0d]): Double &#x3D; Math.log(x) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Using to type aliases, we can sugar even more our constraint: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>Not strictly a Zettelkasten, but almost. I was ready &quot;How to write mathematics&quot; by P. R. Halmos. and on page 134, he discusses how he organizes a book or long article:

  
At one stage of writing a 300-page book I had 1000 sheets of paper, each with a mathematical statement on it, a theorem, a lemma, or even a minor comment, complete with proof. The sheets were numbered, any which way. My job was to indicate on each sheet the numbers of the sheets whose statement must logically come before, and then to arrange the sheets in linear order so that no sheet comes after one on which it&#x27;s mentioned.


Emphasis mine.
It is of course not quite a Zettelkasten, since the numbers are only used to describe predecessors, but I think it is still interesting to look at these examples of almost-Zettelkasten. I think it gives credibility to the Zettelkasten technique that it is not really something entirely new, but that the elements can be recognized elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>Hi, emacs newbie here. I wanted to start using emacs for c, c++, scheme and python programming and first researched auto-completion extensions. I came across auto-complete and company-mode, but most of the discussions I found about them (even on this subreddit) were very old. There were discussions about company-mode being easier, but not supporting docstrings.
 I just want to know as of 2021, how good they are, what about speed? memory? do they work in terminals? how easy are they? does company-mode now support docstrings? Any feedback would be really appreciated.

                    <span>I recently installed emacs and doom emacs on top of it. And its cool and all but i have one question. When ever i launch emacs why is it that the vanilla emacs first starts and then the doom emacs screen comes up? Is that normal? Like when i launch emacs first theres like the normal emacs you get without doom and then like 5 seconds later doom emacs launches.

                    <span>Is it possible to configure whitespace-mode to display only leading whitespace? When displaying whitespace, I find that the space indicators in between words is a bit too much and makes it harder to read, but I really like the idea of just seeing leading whitespace to check indentation etc.
 I&#x27;ve played around with the whitespace-style customization option a fair bit, but haven&#x27;t managed to do what I want. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>The problem occurs with the pcase-let binding in the function below. In the original source buffer it fails to bind and the variables are nil. I copied over the function into another buffer, re-evaluated, and it works. I can only guess it has something to do with the back-quote but I have no idea. Anyone know?
 ​
 (defun org-xob-refile-region () &quot;Move text in region to the end of the top section of a selected node.&quot; (interactive) (org-xob-with-xob-on (when (use-region-p) (pcase-let ((&#x60;(,ID ,title) (org-xob--get-create-node))) &lt;-- binding (when (bound-and-true-p ID) &lt;-- nil (kill-region (point) (mark)) (save-window-excursion (org-with-wide-buffer (org-id-goto ID) (if (org-goto-first-child) (progn (newline 2) (forward-line -1)) (org-end-of-subtree) (newline)) (org-xob--smart-paste)))) ))))

                    <span>For example, I would always like to start firefox in char mode by default, while the other applications in line mode, what can I do?
 Do I need to add a hook to everytime when exwm is opening a new buffer and compare the buffer name with regex? Or is there a default way to do such a thing? I have read the exwm wiki but found no useful guidelines.

                    <span>I apologize if this is a trivial question, but I know very little about web-development, javascript, node.js, etc. 
 Is there anyway I can set up the ox-reveal package so I can open the html file on the browser once and it&#x27;s updated every time I change and save the .org file?
 Thanks.

                    <span>I started getting the titled message from a few days ago every time I clock out a task. I did not make any changes to my config lately, but I did pulled the org repo. (i&#x27;m using straight.el) 
 It seems to me the error is from the org-clock-remove-empty-clock-drawer function within the org-clock-out-hook. 
 And removing the function from the hook does fix the issue immediately. 
 It seems the hook is being executed when the current buffer is the Org Note buffer instead of the org buffer. 
 is anyone else getting this? 
 I was able to reproduce the issue with these steps: 
  
Download https://orgmode.org/org-9.4.6.tar.gz and extract to ~/org-9.4.6
 
Start emacs 27 with emacs -Q 
 evaluate (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/org-9.4.6/lisp&quot;)
 create a new org file, create a heading and clock in 
 evaluate (setq org-log-note-clock-out t) 
 clock out. 
  
I&#x27;m using WSL2/Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows. this shouldn&#x27;t be relevant though.

                    <span>Hi!
 My assumption is that Haskell has no support for a scenario where a client ought to be authenticated (certificate send and verified) as part of establishing a TLS connection. OnCertificateRequest function does not seem to be called back.
 We see a lot of code examples such as this one:
  creds  return creds , onServerCertificate &#x3D; \_ _ _ _ -&gt; return [] } clientParams &#x3D; (defaultParamsClient hostName &quot;&quot;) { clientHooks &#x3D; hooks , clientSupported &#x3D; def { supportedCiphers &#x3D; ciphersuite_all } } tlsSettings &#x3D; TLSSettings clientParams 
 For Windows 10 and ghc 8.4.3 has someone gotten onCertificateRequest called back?

 Juuso

                    <span>I finally got around to play a bit with and found that it needed some tweaks on Spacemacs, here&#x27;s what I am using at the moment:
 In my layers I use just this:
 (haskell :variables haskell-completion-backend &#x27;lsp) 
 I found that this helps quite a bit (in user-config):

                    <span>I have the desire for a top level function. It feels artificial to me to put it in an object that I have to name with an arbitrary noun when I just want to refer to it by its verb method name. So I was toying with this pattern.
 object FormatCurrency { private lazy val instance &#x3D; NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance def apply(num: BigDecimal): String &#x3D; instance.format(num) } 
 so I can call it like FormatCurrency(1.00).
 What do y&#x27;all think? Should it be formatCurrency to make it look more like a function and less like a class constructor?

                    <span>I recently, added projectile, counsel, and vterm to my emacs configuration. I am quite happy with these recent additions, and everything has been going very well.
 Except today, while pair programming in C I discovered that my setup chokes on C files. Emacs runs full tilt using %100 of a core, and the session can no longer be used. I disabled projectile and company (I never have clang installed anyway), but that didn&#x27;t do anything. I can&#x27;t find any crash reports; I presume because emacs is in some infinite loop, so there is no way for it to make a report.
 Anyway, I ran emacs in a terminal with -q to do the hour or so of work in C today (it is not my primary language at work), but I am pretty stumped about what is wrong. I hope someone here has a clue what is happening. I sure as hell don&#x27;…</span>

                    <span>I am trying to set up ox-hugo to auto export files in my org-roam directory. Ox-hugo provides the org-hugo-auto-export-mode function/variable for this purpose. As such, I want to enable this for every org file in the org roam directory but only in that directory. I found here that this can be done with 
 ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))
 added to the directory&#x27;s .dir-locals.el
 After trying this, it simply didn&#x27;t work for me. I have tried restarting as well and with this code snippet, the mode simply doesnt get activated. My problem is this is the first time I have worked with directory local variables/modes and I can&#x27;t find another way to do this online. 
 Anyone have a clue why this isn&#x27;t working. I would love if I could properly do this. 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hello! I just started using Emacs and have a noob question:
 How to configure Emacs to automatically close brackets like in VS code or other text editors?
 I switched from Vim to the latest version of Doom Emacs and didn&#x27;t like the behavior of auto-closing brackets. Specifically, I don&#x27;t like two things:
 - Auto erasing closing bracket(&#x27;|&#x27; -&gt; cursor):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c++ int main() { {| } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; becomes: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;c++ int main() { | &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
  
No new line with indentation after pressing Shift+Enter:
 c++ int main() { { |} } 
 Just Enter:
 c++ int main() { { | } } 
 
 I tried several solutions from the internet, but neither of them worked as I wanted(I also tried hacking on them, but it was really hard because I am a noob in Elisp and Emacs). My requirements are not that high, though: - Add a closing bracket - Add new line and indent after I press Enter (and Shift+Enter) - Don&#x27;t remove the closing bracket when I erase the opening one (I usually start erasing from the closing bracket and when I reach opening one, it removes the next closing bracket)
 In vim, I used simple bindings:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &quot; brackets
 inoremap &quot; &quot;&quot; inoremap &#x27; &#x27;&#x27; inoremap ( () inoremap [ [] inoremap { {} inoremap { {}O inoremap {; {};O 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I tried to implement it in Emacs but couldn&#x27;t. Will appreciate some help.
 Is there a good way for auto closing brackets in Emacs?
 EDIT: I think electric pair suits me. As for me, smartparens&#x27; behavior is really annoying: it deletes closing pair and acts strange. I figured out how to turn off it in Doom Emacs: lisp (remove-hook &#x27;doom-first-buffer-hook #&#x27;smartparens-global-mode) (smartparens-global-mode -1) 
 One thing left: I want auto indentation after pressing Shift+Enter too.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to set up for python development. Everything is working fine so far, only flycheck is giving me some headaches. I&#x27;m using lsp, so flycheck defaults to using lsp as it&#x27;s checker. But I want to use flake8 as the default checker, which depends on the virtual environment to be loaded before. The environment is automatically loaded using direnv. I tried this to select flake8 as default:
 (add-hook &#x27;pyhon-mode-local-vars-hook (lambda () (when (flycheck-may-enable-checker &#x27;python-flake8) (flycheck-select-checker &#x27;python-flake8)))) 
 However it doesn&#x27;t select the checker and I have to do it manually (M-x flycheck-select-checker). I also tried disabling the lsp checker completely and to always select flake8 (without checking if it can be enabled) but it still doesn&#x27;t work. I guess what causes a problem is that flake8 cannot be selected until the environment is loaded, since the executable is in the virtual environment. Is there any way I could still make it load flake8 automatically?

                    <span>Background: With projectile, I usually use projectile-grep or projectile-ag to search for stuff in my code bases or blogs. Thanks to wgrep etc., I can then edit the results in place and perform changes to my project next to any occurrence of the search terms.
 Observation: I noticed that with Emacs&#x27;s new-ish built-in project.el stuff, there&#x27;s C-x p g to perform a regex search (project-find-regexp) without grep in a project. The resulting buffer is using xref-mode. It looks rather nice and tidy. But there&#x27;s no built-in wgrep equivalent to make it editable.
 Question: Is there a wgrep, but for xref-mode? Web search yields confusing results because &#x27;xref&#x27; hashistorically been the name of a couple of things in Emacs land. Help by ye all would be appreciated!

                    <span>Recently, I found out about haskell and got intrigued to find more about it. I was also fascinated with Xmonad so I been tweaking in it. But I&#x27;m having a bit hard time to understand the codes of different modules so I thought it would be best to know the basics of the language as such would help me to understand the codes as well as make me more able. Can you all suggest me books that I can refer to as a novice in this field? 
 I know this question has been asked quite a few times but it all dated atleast 5 years ago or so. It&#x27;s 2021 and many things have changed so I&#x27;m looking for any book which is totally updated and beginners friendly. Please consider myself as total novice in the programming world as I had very little exposure to programming. I know a bit of C and Bash and I used it mainly to make my life easier on Linux by building small scripts. Any sort of help is totally appreciated.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m coming back to my haskell project after some months and hitting the good ol&#x27; &quot;wow this is a giant mess, I should totally revamp this&quot;.
 I&#x27;m realising basically everything I write is of the type foo :: a -&gt; b -&gt; m c for some huge m ~ ReaderT BigOlRecordType1 (StateT BigOlRecordType2 IO).
 This seems like...a huge oversight. For reference, the thing I&#x27;m working on is a text adventure, so the big abstraction I have is a game world populated by objects. If I want to go query some property of some object, I have to lug around this huge monad stack. It doesn&#x27;t feel very haskell-y. Rather than handling propertyCheck :: SomeSpecificObject -&gt; Bool, I&#x27;m doing things like HasSomeSpecificObject w m &#x3D;&gt; EntityID -&gt; m Bool.
 Am I missing something here? It&#x27;d be great if I could deal with little fu…</span>

 These are companies that are hiring right now, and they are all Haskell related, even if they list additional stacks.
 I was honestly a bit surprised how many there were.

I was trying to do some cool Data Analysis pipelines on Scala as a practice but I can&#x27;t seem to find any libraries or learning resources for the exploratory data analysis phase, nor the feature engineering and selection.
 I wonder if anyone here is aware of any libraries/notebooks or other materials showing tools to do EDA (especially visualization) and preprocessing on Scala. Thanks

                    <span>Hello, 
 I have a codebase that&#x27;s quite old now that uses akka http with Futures as a main IO monad and throwing exceptions for error handling.
 I would like to improve on this and have been looking into other options like using Monad Error. However I am wondering how I can handle this because it seems to me in akka http youre obliged to create an exception handler. Also, I am not sure Monad Error will be compatible with the monad used by the app (Future) 
 Any suggestions or code samples i can get inspiration from?

                    <span>I&#x27;m studying Scala with the Coursera specialization. I want to start with scala because 2 reasons: 1) functional programming and 2) higher salaries. I think in November I will complete the specialization. I have 10 years of experience with .NET, Angular, Python, and some Julia. I&#x27;m Latin American, very well paid for Latin American standards. My question is... how do you focus the career plan to get a remote job with North American salaries with North American company?
 ​
 I&#x27;m paid above average for national standards, but the average at the USA is much higher... I would be happy to find a Job with a USA-average salary.....

                    <span>What is a lawless type class, and should they be avoided? Are orphan instances
inherently evil, or just misunderstood? Is global coherence a mistake or a
fundamental requirement? In this post we argue that most of the arguments over
these questions stem from the fact that type classes embody a number of
disparate concepts, with each facet giving rise to perceived wisdom which does
not necessarily map to other facets. We look at the various concepts which are
combined in type classes, and posit how one might disentangle them.

Functions from Types to Values
Consider the following diagram:
Type ----&gt; Type

 |          |

 ▿          |
Value ---&gt; Value

Haskell has been steadily filling out the arrows here. From Value to Value we

Is this the best way to reference other Zettels? I know the question is subjective. Just looking for a clean way to say:

  
This idea links to zettel &quot;B&quot; and here&#x27;s the ID and Title. Revisions welcome.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get lip-mode to work with Go. Here is a snippet from my .emacs config:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ; Packages. (setq package-list &#x27;( lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-ivy magit flycheck company ivy swiper counsel projectile ))
 ; Package repositories. (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;)))
 ; Activate all packages. (package-initialize)
 ; Refresh list of available packages. (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents))
 ; Install any missing packages. (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package)))
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; PLUGINS ;; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
 ; Enable plugins globally. (ivy-mode) (global-flycheck-mode)
 ;; Company Mode (global-company-mode) (setq company-idle-delay 0) (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
 ; Load a language server if one is available. (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;lsp) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It seems like this installed the packages I want, but I can&#x27;t tell if lsp-mode is working. Do I need (package-initialize)? I also see other configures calling (require lsp-mode). I tried doing that and it said symbol undefined.
 Any help?

                    <span>I have many markdown files with pure formatting.
 I have something like this.
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing ![Image name](image.png) ![Image name](image.png) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing ![Image name](image.png) ![Image name](image.png) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing 
 I want an interactive function which will insert empty lines bellow and above images.
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing ![Image name](image.png) ![Image name](image.png) 
 Edited:  
 This looks closer to what I want but will insert empty lines even if an image is already surrounded with empty lines :(

                    <span>I have no idea what this option is called 
 A previous emacs install I used would let me format (Perl) quoted text with spaces or tabs so I could write 
 my $sql &#x3D; &quot;SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz &#x3D; &#x27;done&#x27;&quot;; 
 Hitting tab on those lines would not change the formatting 
 However currently if I hit tab on those lines it changes it to an ugly
 my $sql &#x3D; &quot;SELECT foo, bar FROM wibble WHERE baz &#x3D; &#x27;done&#x27;&quot;; 
 I could use heredoc, but was wondering if there was option I needed to disable.

                    <span>I am working on an NBT parser for Minecraft and I wanted to test my implementation. There is an official test file, but that one is far from code coverage and I had since tried to find the best way to create my own files. These are some examples (ignore .bin files).
 I tried to use hexdump and some other GUI tool which were not very useful imo. The best luck I had was with a custom c++ code but the issue I had was that code is since broken, besides its not the best idea to rewrite source .txt and forget to update the .bin. Which led me to writing my own elisp file editor.
 A binary file would look like this:
 0a 00 00 01 00 00 11 00 ^ ^ ^ ^ | | | end of vector | | byte data | following data will be a byte vector // Those 00 00 are lengths of names of vector and byte // but i removed the names to make it fit on the line // More details in the NBT specs. 
 The above would be diplayed like this:
 0a 0000 01 0000 11 00 
 Or like this: ([%] means vector, b means byte)
 [%] &quot;&quot; { b &quot;&quot; 0x11 } 
 Or:
 [%] &quot;&quot; { b &quot;&quot; 17 } 
 So it should be at least hexadecimal, indented and separated into lines, but I would also add some readability.
 Optional: While editing the file I would like to safeguard myself and do checks on the data that I insert. Maybe even a separate buffer like in calc for stack and trail, but for insert/edit and view.

                    <span>Hi guys. Recently started using ediff for viewing diffs instead of using the default diff sections in magit. So far I am really liking it. Wanted to know if you have any useful customization for making it better.

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a long time Vim user who switched to (DOOM)Emacs yesterday and I am looking for a way to translate all of my UltiSnips LaTeX snippets to yasnippet. So far I figured out how make basic snippets which can be expanded by pressing TAB and snippets which expand only in certain environments like the math environment but I can&#x27;t figure out how to translate my more complicated snippets which expand automatically. Here is an UltiSnips example:
 snippet / &quot;Fraction&quot; i
 \\frac{${VISUAL}}{$1}$0
 endsnippet
 What this one does is the following: If type 1/ it will automatically expand to \frac{1}{} . Another example is the ket:
 priority 100
 context &quot;math()&quot;
 snippet &quot;\|(.*?)\&gt;&quot; &quot;ket&quot; riA
 \ket{\!p[snip.rv&#x3D;match.group](https://snip.rv&#x3D;match.group)(1)\}\&#x60;&#x60;
 endsnippet
 This gives me \ket{a} when I type |a&gt; . I&#x27;m sure there must be a way to write snippets like these in yasnippet but I haven&#x27;t found any examples of such snippets.

                    <span>Being a user of multiple-cursors.el, I have always been envious of evil-mc&#x27;s abilities to pause fake cursors and allow free movements for the real one but that evil variant doesn&#x27;t suit me because it doesn&#x27;t play well with non-evil commands (like sp-kill-sexp).
 After scavenging on the Internet without success results, I decided to write those myself: after-multiple-cursors-core.el
 Although a hack, the idea is simple: Just extract cursor positions from mc/all-fake-cursors&#x27;s output and save it in an association list (maybe we don&#x27;t need a hash table since it&#x27;s not too often, and buffer-local variables are lost when we revert the buffer; and yes there&#x27;s the limitation of editing will render positions incorrect, but I think we don&#x27;t need to handle that case) with buffer objects as keys.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I have an LG 2k 34-inch ultra-wide monitor, which I have setup sideways in portait-mode(which I setup with xrandr).
 Anyways, how do I correctly setup emacs for it to look better? 
 The text does not fit correctly on the screen, so it looks messy.
 I&#x27;m going to try out different font sizes, but I was wondering if other elisp packages/configurations would help with this particular setup?
 I heard about horizontal scrolling, but I need to look more into it.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>At this year&#x27;s HasuraCon we&#x27;re doing a workshop on how to extend the Hasura GraphQL-Engine with support for a new database backend.
 At the workshop (on 2021-06-24, 16:00-17:00 UTC), /u/nicuveo and /u/plcplc will be going through the parts of the design of the Hasura GraphQL-Engine that enable backend modularity, and showcasing the work needed to develop a backend for SQLite from scratch.
 Those interested can head to https://hasura.io/events/hasura-con-2021/register/ and register for the conference, which spans the two days of Wednesday 2021-06-23 and Thursday 2021-06-24.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working to understand the theory behind algebraic effects, with the understanding that that&#x27;s what Polysemy&#x27;s based on. I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m fundamentally confused. 
 Following through citations (Polysemy cites Kiselyov and Ishii, who cite Kammar, Lindley, and Oury, who cite various papers by Plotkin and Pretnar) strongly suggests that &quot;extensible effects&quot; are just a rebranding of &quot;algebraic effects&quot;, and that equational reasoning gets left out of implementations because that&#x27;s more practical (but Polysemy&#x27;s trying to add it back?). Is this a good understanding of the situation?
 Similarly, in Petnar&#x27;s representations of algebraic effects (e.g.), it&#x27;s quite important that the handlers have access to the computation&#x27;s continuation, and get to decide how it&#x27;s used. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any support for this in Polysemey, but everything&#x27;s phrased so differently it&#x27;s difficult to search. 
 Any suggestions for bridging the gap between theory and practice, or for quickly getting up to speed on the last twenty years of research in this area?

                    <span>A new release of fakedata has been released: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata
 Brief Summary of what fakedata is: It&#x27;s a library for producing fake data such as names, addresses and phone numbers.
 The changelog contains the list of changes in this release: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata/releases/tag/v1.0
 Note that this release contains breaking change. I have documented it with more detail in the changelog entry. The most interesting one is making Fake type as a transformer which allows writing efficient code more easily. This was done by Isaac Van Bakel and more details are here: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata#using-the-faket-transformer
 The current release also adds various new modules (+ 15), locale improvements and contains updates to fake data sources. Also, the test suite has been enhanced which helped me find bugs in the upstream Ruby data sources (Corresponding fix: https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker/pull/2339) . And thanks to Tristan de Cacqueray for fixing the test failure issues related to random 1.2.0 as part of ZuriHac.
 The following packages can be used to create generators out of fakedata:
 * quickcheck integration by Jappie Klooster: https://github.com/fakedata-haskell/fakedata-quickcheck
 * hedgehog integration by Matt Parsons: https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hedgehog-fakedata

 I am using Doom Emacs with (org +pretty) and org-autolist installed (disabling this didn&#x27;t seem to change behavior) if that is relevant.
 I am kinda new to org-mode so apologies if this is dumb. Any help is appreciated including alternate ideas.

                    <span>I just found Orgzly and would like to use it as a diary/journal.
 I like that I can add entries quickly into my Diary note using the + widget.
 However when I go into the app, I&#x27;d like to see my entries listed by date (with the creation date on the left), instead of as a bullet list... What am I missing?
 Note that I&#x27;m not talking about scheduled tasks/events. I&#x27;d just like to do simple journal entries, and see them in a journal format.
 PS: I&#x27;m posting here because this sub seems to be the most active with Orgzly. To be honest I don&#x27;t really know what orgmode is!

                    <span>I use doom emacs and use org mode in it. I have the below configuration for TODO states.
 (setq org-todo-keywords
 &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;PROJ(p)&quot; &quot;NEXT(n)&quot; &quot;WAIT(w)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot; &quot;CANC(c)&quot;)))
 The fast access to TODO states as mentioned in https://orgmode.org/manual/Fast-access-to-TODO-states.html#Fast-access-to-TODO-states doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me anymore. When I do &quot;SPC m t&quot; it just tries to cycle through the available TODO states TODO-&gt;PROJ-&gt;NEXT ... and not ask for a shortcut letter to my desired state.
 I remember this stopped working after I did a fresh install of doom emacs, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to doom emacs. Any pointers on where to look at?

                    <span>It&#x27;s a small thing and I don&#x27;t know why it bothers me. 
 When I create a list and I hit enter to start the next item, it always indents the cursor. Is there a way to stop this?

                    <span>Hi all!
 I wonder what is the right/common way to collect outputs from multiple asynchronous processes (which may run concurrently) into one log buffer. So far I have found three options:
  
Associate all the processes with the log buffer (as the process buffer). This is discouraged in the manual and indeed seems like a bad idea (it may interleave the outputs).
 
Create a unique process buffer for each process and copy the output from the process buffer to the log buffer at the end in the process sentinel. The problem is that we may have lots of buffers left. It seems to work if we kill the buffer as well in the sentinel, but I am not sure if that works reliably. Here is a sample of this solution:
 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (require &#x27;cl-lib) (defconst output-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*output*&quot;)) (defun copy…</span>

 my emacs config is pretty much vanilla, I&#x27;m just using python-mode. Any ideas? thanks.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to disable a specific behavior in *eshell* buffer, that is very much similar to the result of applying the comint-postoutput-scroll-to-bottom in inferior buffers, like M-x shell or M-x ielm (and others alike).
 For the buffers that use comint mode, I can simple remove-hook from the comint-output-filter-functions, and whenever I use C-l C-l to recenter current line to be the top one, and evaluate some expression, I like that the top line I was on is still the top line (unless the expression result is bigger than the window height).
 *eshell* always moves current line to the bottom first, then prints the result of the command, which is a bit annoying, as I mostly use it in a long vertical buffer, and going from the top to the bottom visually is very distracting. Clearing previous output is not an option, because I want to refer to it occasionally.
 But I can&#x27;t seem to find anything in eshell that corresponds to this feature, and it doesn&#x27;t use comint either, so any help would be great. Thanks!

                    <span>while googling around, i stumbled upon a project called rmsbolt https://gitlab.com/jgkamat/rmsbolt
 it&#x27;s like godbolt but it is extendable, supports multiple languages, written in elisp and is completely offline. thought i&#x27;d share my discovery :)

                    <span>Unless there are links in the help screens to related functions it is always necessary to use C-h f to search for the related function you want to look at.
 e.g the screen for set-buffer contains links to with-current-buffer, pop-buffer and switch-to-buffer. So if you want to view current-buffer or save-to-current-buffer you have to use C-h f to get them.
 Even more annoying is the set-x family of commands. set, setq, setq-local, setq-default etc.
 Isn&#x27;t there some way around this, eg, setting some advice where on displaying a page you could display your own manual or automatically generated links below them.

                    <span>I am begining go find Emacs key combinations such as Ctrl-Alt-Shift-&#x27; (mark-sexp) too awkward and I&#x27;m now looking at different key schemes such as modalka, god-mode, ryo-modal etc.
 With modalka there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any particular leader key, though I suspect I haven&#x27;t read it well enough or understand it.

                    <span>I&#x27;m getting a really weird issue with my package with Unicode on GHC 9.0.1.
 Where I expect to see, respectively
  
β (or \946) and
 γ (or \947)
  
I instead see
  
β?KQHTLXOCBJSPDZRAMEWNIUYGV and
 γ?EYJVCNIXWPBQMDRTAKZGFUHOS
  
and the appended strings come from elsewhere in my code!
 This one really has me stumped, and any help is much appreciated! It feels like something deep in how Unicode is stored, unless it&#x27;s just my bad code (which has worked fine since GHC 7.10.3).

                    <span>I think this is a pretty straight forward yes or no question, so here goes: as a beginner I&#x27;m starting to see the cleanliness of defining point-free functions. Somtimes I&#x27;m having trouble doing it though, especially when the input variable needs to be fed to multiple intermediate functions, like when you&#x27;d want to find the average of an Int array:
 avg :: [Int] -&gt; Double avg xs &#x3D; fromIntegral (sum xs) / (fromIntegral (length xs)) 
 So I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to do it at all, or if I should even bother.

                    <span>Is the system described in https://youtu.be/sl2zo7tzrO8 still up and running in Facebook? I want to make sure I don&#x27;t provide outdated information when advocating Haskell.
 There are 2 aspects to this:
  
Is Haskell still being used for Spam Filtering?
 Is the system still using Static Rules? Or all static rules are gone and replaced with ML models?
  
Two friends who left Facebook at 2016 gave me contradicting information, one said it was replaced with ML written in C++, and the other said the system is still up and running. So I am asking here to see if anyone has more recent information.

                    <span>(Background issue I&#x27;m facing: https://github.com/snapframework/snap-core/issues/309)
 I think the functionality of MonadUnliftIO is exactly what I want, but unfortunately Snap appears not eligible for:
  
the intuition is that a monad must have no monadic state, but may have monadic context. This essentially limits MonadUnliftIO to ReaderT and IdentityT transformers on top of IO.
  
Then I found Snap has a MonadBaseControl instance, and thought it should work for me. But sadly to find it losing states. Also I failed to find a user side example of MonadBaseControl on Github (as there&#x27;re only instance impl. hits), so I have not way to verify whether that&#x27;s due to my incorrect usage.
 Any way quoting u/snoyberg : https://github.com/fpco/unliftio/issues/17#issuecomment-363655106

                    <span>Hi all, this is a minor question but am curious. I have beorg on my iPhone 6, and every time I start it it takes a number of seconds to sync, even if nothing has changed, and then a few more seconds to “settle down” Usually I hope to quickly add a note, and then move on, so it has some slight friction for usage. Especially when I close and reopen to add another thing — same long wait though nothing has changed. Any thoughts? My org files are not particularly large.

                    <span>Can I, as an historian, use a Zettelkasten for my research?  For me, history is a way of connecting various pieces of evidence from the past, both diachronically (connecting similar items over time) and synchronically (connecting different items from the same time), to find patterns and to draw conclusions.  A Zettelkasten would therefore seem an ideal tool for making these connections and helping to draw the relevant conclusions.  However, the way I work doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the Zettelkasten &#x27;method&#x27; described in this forum, especially in relation to reading notes.
The first stage of my work is to collect the evidence, usually from various different primary sources.  This usually involves noting the evidence verbatim.  I may summarise it later, but I need to work from the original evidence…</span>

                    <span>I use pass to store all my passwords. I&#x27;ve started setting up gnus, and I&#x27;ve got it working, though I don&#x27;t want to have to manually write down my passwords in ~/.authinfo. This isn&#x27;t a security issue -- I know I could encrypt it and use ~/.authinfo.gpg -- it&#x27;s a convenience thing. I don&#x27;t want to have to manually change the settings as well as updating my pass database every time I change my passwords (quite often).
 So, is there a way to have gnus read in my pass?
 Come to that, I used to use neomutt, which didn&#x27;t need ~/.authinfo, and all other information (usernames, smtp ports, etc.) could be stored in the config. Could I do this with gnus too and get rid of one more file altogether?
 TIA!

                    <span>Hey there,
 I often do this for work aka these two commands in an &#x27;ansi-term&#x27; session, but have to manually type them, hit enter, and wait for connections for both separate commands:
 gcloud compute ssh --project (name of 1st box) (name of 2nd box)
 ssh (alias for end point box)
 ​
 I&#x27;m being a bit vague because yeah, its for work. 
 But, can someone please help me figure out how I can add Tramp to this combination? Also, how could I configure it to a keyboard macro as well?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve used Tramp to remotely edit my website as if it were local, and I absolutely love it. Wanted to do the same thing and blow some coworkers minds about how you can do this. Reason being is that I can install anything on these endpoint boxes, so I figured maybe Tramp might come to the rescue for this situation.
 ​
 Thanks!

 relative line numbers on the right margin
 line numbers on all buffers, i.e on new/empty ones as well
 this whole thing switched on by default at boot
  
Now, thanks to this great post on StackOverflow, I achieved points 1 and 2, but 3 I am absolutely unable to get and for 4, I can do it with Meta/Alt-x then linum-mode but not on startup. Kindly help for 3 and 4.

                    <span>Greetings Emacsians! I, emacs noob, am back with additional questions. I am configuring emacs to be my personal calendar and task management system. I really like the &quot;M-x org-agenda a&quot;
 view&#x27;s information, but I don&#x27;t like its formatting.
 First and foremost, long lines look terrible. I have &quot;word wrap visual line mode&quot; activated, which wraps lines in all org files. I also have the &quot;adaptive-wrap&quot; packaged installed and active, and that makes the text wrapping in normal org mode files look much better since indenting is respected. However, this package seems to have no effect on the org agenda views. 
 Q: How can I force org agenda views to also wrap nicely such that indentation is respected? (i.e. like &quot;adaptive-wrap&quot; does for ordinary org mode files?)
 Separately, there are two other aspects of the org agenda view formatting I&#x27;d like to change (including them here since they are also related to org agenda view formatting even though they are otherwise separate issues).
 (1) Since the todo&#x27;s are pulled from multiple files with different filename lengths, the &quot;todo&quot; keywords and descriptions of the todos are not aligned, and this makes the view look visually chaotic. Is there a way to tell the agenda daily/weekly view not to include the filename of each todo?
 (2) There is no extra vertical space between one todo and the next which makes it visually difficult to see where one todo ends and the next one begins. Is there a way to specify that a small amount of vertical margin beneath every todo?

 When changing the Gnome theme (I usually switch between &#x27;Adwaita&#x27; and &#x27;Adwaita Dark&#x27;), the Emacs frame decorations get updated accordingly (using 28.0 with pgtk), but the Emacs theme does not change.
 The configuration below sets up a DBus handler that is triggered when the Gnome GTK theme changes, and it sets the appropriate Modus theme.
 (use-package dbus) (use-package modus-themes :after (dbus) :config (defun set-modus-theme-from-gtk () &quot;Set modus theme by checking whether GTK theme is dark.&quot; (let ((gtk-theme (downcase (call-process-string &quot;gsettings&quot; &quot;get&quot; &quot;org.gnome.desktop.interface&quot; &quot;gtk-theme&quot;)))) (if (or (string-match-p &quot;dark&quot; gtk-theme) (string-match-p &quot;black&quot; gtk-theme)) (modus-themes-load-vivendi) (modus-themes-load-operandi)))) (defun gtk-theme-changed (path _ _) &quot;DBus handler to detect when the GTK theme has changed.&quot; (when (string-equal path &quot;/org/gnome/desktop/interface/gtk-theme&quot;) (set-modus-theme-from-gtk))) (dbus-register-signal :session &quot;ca.desrt.dconf&quot; &quot;/ca/desrt/dconf/Writer/user&quot; &quot;ca.desrt.dconf.Writer&quot; &quot;Notify&quot; #&#x27;gtk-theme-changed) (set-modus-theme-from-gtk)) (defun call-process-string (program &amp;rest args) &quot;Call process&#x60;PROGRAM&#x27; with &#x60;ARGS&#x27; and return the output as string.&quot; (with-temp-buffer (apply #&#x27;call-process program nil t nil args) (buffer-string)))

                    <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m pretty inexperienced with ELisp, so if you could help me out that would be great.
 I&#x27;m trying to create a function that I can call with a key binding that will prompt me for a buffer (I&#x27;m thinking (counsel-ibuffer) style), and open the buffer as a new split next to my current buffer. Since the native emacs split functions only take dimensions as arguments (so far as I can tell) and I use evil mode, here is what I have:
  (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (evil-split-buffer &#x27;(counsel-ibuffer))) 
 If you guys know of any way to get this working, please let me know. Thank you!
 EDIT: Resolved, thanks to u/flexibeast. Here is their code for people with this problem in the future:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun other-buff-to-split () (interactive) (ivy-read &quot;Switch to buffer: &quot; (counsel-ibuffer--get-buffers) :history &#x27;counsel-ibuffer-history :action #&#x27;other-buff-to-split-1))
 (defun other-buff-to-split-1 (x) (evil-split-buffer (cdr x))) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                    <span>I know Emacs can automatically decrypt .gpg file when I open it in dired. However, when I open a .gpg file, the mini buffer stuck at &quot;decrypting 0%&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t prompt me for the passphase no matter how long I wait.
 If I go to the shell and manually use gpg command to decrypt a file, and I enter my passphase in the shell, the passphase is cached for a certain time. When the passphase is cached, I can now decrypt the .gpg file by opening it in dired, and this seems to be the only way that I can successfully decrypt a file automatically. It is not only annoying but stupid.
 Why is Emacs not prompting for anything when it needs my passphase? Am I missing any configurations to make it works?
 I am using Emacs 28.0.5 with native compilation.
 Edit: I am using Arch and Exwm and I use startx to initialize Emacs. I just noticed that, when I quit Emacs, I saw the tty shell was prompting for passphase, I have no way to enter my passphase there when I am in GUI mode, what am I supposed to do?

                    <span>I seem to not be able to stop trying to tweak my lsp configuration regarding which features it uses, and which ones are disabled. Out of the box, it seems very busy. I&#x27;ve found this guide on enabling/disabling features which is quite helpful in understanding what everything is and how to toggle each piece. Nonetheless, i found that I just keep tweaking it; the lsp user interface just seems to always be in my way in some sense, or I end up disabling something I want later. (I&#x27;m using Doom, fyi.)
 I&#x27;m hoping to crowdsource a solution to my continual tweaking. Which combo of lsp features to you find are best for getting helpful info, and otherwise staying out of the way?

 Seems like a possible alternative to using org-mode for todo lists, but I can only find a few mentions of it online.
 I think I like the structure it imposes, because sometimes org-mode&#x27;s many features and flexibility can be distracting. 
 Is it harder to integrate with other parts of Emacs?

                    <span>Is it possible to customize the agenda view that is shown when clicking on a tag? Ideally grouping using org-super-agenda.
 If this is possible is it then possible to have custom views / groupings based on a parent tag? For example if the tag that is clicked on is part of the “people” parent tag, do X otherwise do Y.

 I would like to have GitHub automatically publish something like this: https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#intro (table of contents, folding, on a GitHub.io domain). Is it possible to utilize GitHub CI to automatically 
  
Add all org files in the repository 
 Convert/format it as html (similar to tecosaurs format)
 Publish it

                    <span>I want to create a capture template that writes to the currently open file under a given heading (say Meetings) creating it if necessary. 
 One use case: I work on multiple projects and use an org file for each. I want to use a meeting minutes template that writes to the org file of the project that I have open. 
 I currently use refile but I forget to do so sometimes. I also heard about C-0 but I&#x27;m looking for a better solution. 
 I use Doom emacs if that is relevant. 
 Any help along this line or a different way of dealing with this is appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>Alright, girls, boys, and those who lie in-between. We know there are already libraries written in Scala 3, but how many end-user apps are there? Because I have one for you! 🥳
 ... and it&#x27;s a calculator.
 https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/calculator3
 From here you can download the APK file and install it on your phone with &#x60;adb&#x60; and a USB cable. I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to register this app on F-Droid or, gods have mercy, Google Play Store. In the future, I will do it with a more complex app I have in plans, but for now, &#x60;adb install&#x60; is the way to go). Or you can copy the whole repo and build the app yourselves.
 Here&#x27;s how it looks like:
 Scala 3 Calculator
 This remarkable achievement of razor-edge tech and top-notch UX wouldn&#x27;t be possible without all the brilliant people working on Scala 3, GraalVM, Gluon, JavaFX, and scala-maven-plugin. Me, I&#x27;m just putting the puzzles together.
 That being said, Scala 3 support still needs some love. There are issues, mostly around JVM/Scala compatibility (Java modules *coff* *coff*) . Now I will spend some time describing what I found about them the best I could - and nagging the above-mentioned brilliant people to take a look. But, all in all, I think we&#x27;re really doing great. I didn&#x27;t expect the migration to be so easy. Just as earlier I didn&#x27;t expect all these different pieces would so easily fall into their places and a Scala app on Android would just work. I feel... grateful. And also super happy - hence the tone of this entry.
 Cheers 😊

 Procedural pixel-art campfire
 I&#x27;ve written up a little tutorial on how to make a procedural pixel art fire shader in Indigo (Scala game engine).
 https://indigoengine.io/docs/guides/howto-fire-shader
 If you&#x27;d rather jump straight into the code, there is a GitHub repo that accompanies the how-to guide here:

                    <span>Tutanota works differently to other email providers, and unfortunately I have only been able to get their official desktop client to work. 
 Has anybody here figured out how to get Tutanota to work with Emacs?

                    <span>I&#x27;m really interested in having completion and validation when editing my kubernetes manifest files.
 But can&#x27;t figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on emacs
 I followed the official guide, using npm to install the yaml lsp server and enabling the lsp mode for yaml files.
 FIRST PROBLEM: if I use the combination keys (C-M-i) I used to run company-complete, in yaml mode it runs the ispell-complete-word and I can&#x27;t understand why
 SECOND PROBLEM: when I run lsp-yaml-set-buffer-schema or lsp-yaml-select-buffer-schema and I select a json schema, I get the following error in lsp-resolve-value(set-from-style) function
 (void-variable set-from-style)
 ​
 Did somebody figure out how to get working lsp and yaml on Emacs? You can even apply json schema for some CRD, like the ones managed by Istio?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not sure if I asked it correctly but what I mean is I have a buffer with this text: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (&quot;test&quot; 0 4 (font-lock-face org-level-1))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (which is the output of (propertize &quot;test&quot; &#x27;font-lock-face &#x27;org-level-1) btw)
 and I want to insert processed (faces applied to &quot;test&quot;) version of that text. But my try:
  (insert (with-current-buffer (get-buffer &quot;test&quot;) (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))) 
 inserts the exact same of buffer content.
 I want to insert it as (insert (propertize &quot;test&quot; &#x27;font-lock-face &#x27;org-level-1)) do.
 How can I achieve this?
 Background info: I want to show my daily agenda in the start screen (dashboard) but it takes time, so I&#x27;m trying to do this in emacsclient asynchronously.

                    <span>I tried to set split screen divider-width but it seems it stays that way even when there&#x27;s no split screen, leaving me with a divider that makes no sense.
 (setq default-frame-alist (append (list &#x27;(right-divider-width . 20) &#x27;(bottom-divider-width . 2)))) 
 Is there any way to set divider-width only when there&#x27;s a split screen present, otherwise make it nil?

                    <span>Functions from packages are reported as natively compiled, but my &quot;.el&quot; files are not.
 EmacsWiki: GCC Emacs said:
  
When a byte-compiled Elisp module is loaded, it gets queued for native compilation. Once native compilation has finished, the native-compiled definitions automatically replace the byte-compiled versions.
  
In my config:
 (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation t) (byte-recompile-file file nil 0 &#x27;load) 
 But functions in file are just byte-compiled, even after a looong time. I have seen emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load, but isn&#x27;t it usable for active buffers only?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m using org-mode to write my notes and occasionally I insert a latex code block when org-mode itself isn&#x27;t enough. In those situations I use org-edit-special which pops me into a latex buffer with the contents of the code block, but because auctex doesnt see the usepackage headers that are available on export, it doesn&#x27;t load any of the cool macros or environments I have set up for completion. Does anyone have a workaround for this?
 Edit:
 Here&#x27;s something that works for now:
 elisp (add-hook &#x27;org-src-mode-hook (defun org-src-setup-auctex () (when (eq major-mode &#x27;latex-mode) (apply #&#x27;TeX-run-style-hooks (mapcar #&#x27;cadr org-latex-packages-alist)))))

                    <span>Problem
 If I have a list and I hit return, I want it to add a new item to the list (instead of adding notes to said item). M-return has the functionality I want, but I want it to be mapped to return.
 Basically, I want to swap M-return and return in org-mode.

 I have tried a handful of things, which have all failed.

The end result is that my table became too wide for me. Is there a way to (manually) split the second column over 2 lines? For instance my position is on the middle of the second column. Then I use some function and the rest of the column goes to a new inserted line. Thanks in advance for your help.

                    <span>Is there a way to define a &quot;super type&quot; in Scala? It seems like types can not implement traits. What I want to do is something like this example, where I basically I have this trait:
 type ScrollBar &#x3D; ... type Window &#x3D; ... trait Widget[A] { def CreateScrollBar[B]() : ScrollBar def CreateWindow[B]() : Window } 
 And some type that implement it using ad hoc polymorphism:
 implicit val pmWidget : Widget[PMWidget] &#x3D; new Widget[PMWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[PMScrollBar](): ScrollBar &#x3D; ... def CreateWindow[PMWindow](): Window &#x3D; ... } 
 But I want both ScrollBar and Window to be of a specific type, referent to my PMWidget:
 type MotifScrollBar &#x3D; ... type MotifWindow &#x3D; ... type MotifWidget &#x3D; (MotifScrollBar, MotifWindow) 
 Is there a way to do this using type declarations? I thought about something like:
 type ScrollBar[A] &#x3D; A type Window[A] &#x3D; A 
 But if I implement it like this (using ints just to simplify):
 type MotifScrollBar &#x3D; Int type MotifWindow &#x3D; Int implicit val pmWidget : Widget[MotifWidget] &#x3D; new Widget[MotifWidget] { def CreateScrollBar[MotifScrollBar](): ScrollBar[MotifScrollBar] &#x3D; 0 // type mismatch here def CreateWindow[MotifWindow](): Window[MotifWindow] &#x3D; 0 // type mismatch here } 
 I&#x27;m getting type mismatches where I indicated. Is there some workaround?

                    <span>Hi there, finally I stole some time to:
  
publish my moldable-emacs code (very early release actually, just for the brave users)
 sort my ideas about the vision of the mode
 show how to explore JSON with it
  
Maybe this will be interesting to you too!
 (By the way, I shared earlier how to use this to list all code duplication in a source code buffer.)

                    <span>Hello!
 As in the title; I have forked general.el to add a few autoloaded keywords of my own, by using the :general keyword use-package functions as a template. However, this bit of code, originally used for :general, is not working (read &quot;not being autoloaded&quot;):
 emacs-lisp (defun use-package-handler/:gone (name _keyword args rest state) &quot;Use-package handler for :gone.&quot; (use-package-concat (use-package-process-keywords name rest state) &#x60;(,@(mapcar (lambda (arglist) ;; Note: prefix commands are not valid functions (if (or (functionp (car arglist)) (macrop (car arglist))) &#x60;(,@arglist :package &#x27;,name) &#x60;(general-def (:keymaps &#x27;(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)) ,@arglist :package &#x27;,name))) (plist-get args :arglists))))) 
 The part I have changed is the general-def bit, by adding (:keymaps &#x27;(global aiern-insert-state-map aiern-normal-state-map)). When demanding the package, it works fine. Am I missing anything here? I&#x27;ve also copied the use-package-autoloads/:general and use-package-handler/:general functions as well, which are exactly the same, and renaming them appropriately.
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                    <span>I have an issue where my .dir-locals are getting bigger and bigger, namely due to my current projects using prettier in quite a few different major modes. But also due to specific eglot setups. Enabling prettier and eglot for the relevant major-mode would work in these projects, but would start becoming annoying in the others.
 In trying to move most of the logic to my Emacs configuration and have less duplicates in each of my project roots, I tried the following:
 ;; path/to/my/project/.dir-locals.el ((nil . ((me/eglot-p . t) (me/prettier-p . t)))) ;; dotemacs.el (use-package prettier :preface (defvar-local me/prettier-p nil &quot;Should prettier be enabled?&quot;) :hook (web-mode . me/prettier-mode-maybe) :config (put &#x27;me/prettier-p &#x27;safe-local-variable #&#x27;booleanp)) (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () &quot;Enable &#x60;prettier-mode&#x27; when the prettier executable is found locally.&quot; (when me/prettier-p (prettier-mode))) 
 The issue with that is that dir-local variables are taken into account after web-mode-hook has kicked in, even with nil when no major-mode is specified. So me/prettier-p is always nil in me/prettier-mode-maybe.
 A second attempt, ignoring dir-local variables altogether, looked like this:
 (defun me/prettier-mode-maybe () &quot;Enable &#x60;prettier-mode&#x27; when the prettier executable is found locally.&quot; (when-let ((command (shell-command-to-string &quot;npm list -p prettier&quot;)) (prettier-p (length&gt; (string-trim-right command) 0))) (prettier-mode))) 
 Which is obviously too slow to be acceptable.
 What are your preferred methods to avoid having to copy the same .dir-locals.el every time you start a similar project or even reinstall your machine(s)? That was actually my case btw: I realized while reinstalling my machine how much stuff I had to copy around after cloning all my repositories.

 I have three problems that I cannot fix, if possible, can you help?
  
Close Emacs win LWin+Q
 What I tried:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;s-q&quot;) &#x27;kill-emacs)
 Open shell with &#x60; (tilde key below esc) and if already open, close with &#x60; (tilde key below esc)
 What I tried:
 (global-set-key [f1] &#x27;shell)

 When I create multiple windows (ctrl+x 3, ctrl+x 2) I find it difficult to navigate to the third, fourth or fifth window. Is there a solution?

                    <span>Has someone here made this switch? Relatively new to working with email on emacs, but I have previously set up gnus on my primary machine to send/receive mail from my gmail account. 
 I&#x27;ve setup mu4e on another machine, but I would like to use it on the gnus machine. Is there any way I can do this without having to setup offlineimap again? I don&#x27;t think that gnus actually stores emails locally so perhaps that&#x27;s not possible...

                    <span>Have you ever had a technical question about GHC you didn&#x27;t get a good answer for?
 Tomorrow, Saturday June 19, 17:00 Zurich time, there will be a GHC ask-me-anything panel discussion.
 It will be live-streamed on YouTube on the ZuriHac channel.
 We will have Simon Peyton-Jones and Ben Gamari on the panel as GHC developers, and we need you to ask them questions!
 You can ask your questions:
  
Live via the ZuriHac Discord, channel #ghc-panel-discussion
 Live via the libera.chat IRC channel #ghc; prefix your question with nh2: ZuriHac GHC AMA question:
 Here any time (I will collect the questons until 1 hour before the event)
  
The questions will read to the panelists during the event.
 We&#x27;d like to get technical questions about GHC, e.g. “how does class instance lookup work?”, not so much personal questions like “how long have you worked on GHC?”.
  
ZuriHac is the world&#x27;s largest Haskell Hackathon. It is free to join, and this year it is remote, so you can join simply by registering on https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2021/ Registering will send you the Discord invite, in case you want to ask your questions there.

                    <span>What is Hideout?
  
Hideout is a self-hosted service that makes private, persistent chat rooms possible. It requires no installation or account creation. Unlike disposable chat, a Hideout room preserves privacy without expiring.
 The GitHub repo contains a detailed introduction, and guides for hosting, building, and contributing: https://github.com/techmindful/hideout
 A video demo can be watched here: https://vimeo.com/564494164.
 A demo instance is running at hideout-demo.com. Uptime is expected to be unstable. Do not trust it for your own private conversations.
 Language stack is Haskell/Elm. Haskell, Elm, and the privacy community need more killer apps! Hideout tries to be as pretty and feature-rich as possible, so that when people opt for privacy, they won&#x27;t be getting a lackluster alternative.

A data declaration introduces one or more type constructors and one or more value constructors for each type constructor.
  
Out of curiosity, in what syntax can &quot;more&quot; type constructors be defined in &quot;a&quot; data declaration?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 Chordify is hiring again! This post might look familiar to you if you&#x27;ve been around here for a while. That&#x27;s because I posted about a vacancy we had back in October. Since then, we&#x27;ve hired two new developers, but we&#x27;re still expanding!
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

                    <span>I have to use a js lib that wants me to reject a promise with a json object:
 { requeue: true } 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to use Variant approach (inspired by https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-chirashi)
 type MyError &#x3D; Variant (ErrorRow ()) type ErrorRow r &#x3D; ( requeue :: Boolean | r ) case foo of Right h -&gt; h Left _ -&gt; Aff.throwError $ mkVariantError (inj (Proxy :: Proxy &quot;requeue&quot;) true) 
 But all I could get was:
 {&quot;variant&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;requeue&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true},&quot;message&quot;:&quot;VariantError&quot;} 
 Is there an easy way to do this? Thanks for any tips.

 Code looks like this. This mapping looks quite clear to me and I cant understand why is there type misamatching.
