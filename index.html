                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I am new to Scala and have learnt about it as I am having 2 courses at my uni,
 in order to learn a new programming paradigm. 
 We are using Scala 3 at Uni.
 I have for myself found, that I do not learn a lot from doing the exercises, but the mere syntax.
 We are provided with code via gitlab and only have to compile basically.
 I would like to do some own little projects in scala to get deeper into it and exercise before the exams.
 I&#x27;ve my setup in IntelliJ and I am using sbt.
 So far the issue I am having is I do not get how to manage dependancies correctly.
 Or say I really don&#x27;t know how to manage them at all.
 I thought potentially you guys got some good source here.
 I am essentially looking for some sort of quickstart, that helps me out setting up my environments eas…</span>

 Functional applications offer numerous benefits in modern software development. They enhance testability, modularity, and composability, leading to more maintainable and scalable codebases. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore the syntax and semantics of functional applications and introduce the app-toolkit library—a powerful tool for building functional applications more efficiently.
 Syntax and Semantic of an App
 At its core, an app can be represented as a function that takes an input (I) and produces an output (O). By incorporating side effects, we extend this representation to I &#x3D;&gt; F[O], where F[_] denotes the ability to handle side effects.
 Resources
 To build an app, we rely on resources such as app information, input arguments, a logger, and configuration settings.

I&#x27;m considering using A7 index cards for my main box, and A8 index cards for my bibliographical box (yes, I want to build an analogic Zettelkasten). I presume that single cards will be sufficient for my notes in most cases, and if I need some more space I can always make a &quot;double&quot; note by using two cards (or even more).
What do you think? What size are your cards?</span>

I saw about reference manager tools (like Zotero) for the process of note-taking (not especially for Zettelkasten).
Is it as useful as it pretends to be ?
Why do you use one ?
How does it fit in your workflow ?
Thanks !</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs for the past 5 years, and I&#x27;m ashamed to say I don&#x27;t really know Emacs. Today I came across meow and wanted to try it out; I commented out my .emacs.d folder and started from scratch.
 Simple things like the M-x popup isn&#x27;t actually stock. In Doom, it&#x27;s provided by a package called vertico. Then other packages provide fuzzy matching in vertico.
 To get out from M-x I had to press Escape 3 times. And this is without bringing up how unintuitive the keybindings are (like moving around).
 Emacs could do with much needed polish. Without Doom Emacs (and its configuration) and the amazing packages people provide, I don&#x27;t think I could use Emacs.
 It&#x27;s no wonder Emacs isn&#x27;t really brought up in conversation. I would like to see improvements in usability. It needs built-in quality-of-life improvements to be more accessible to people. Emacs being extremely powerful and extensible means nothing if the average person isn&#x27;t able to use that to their benefit.
 I hope I didn&#x27;t come across as too criticising; I do love Emacs and spend most of my day in it. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs to edit my latex documents. I have the auctex emacs package installed, as well as latex-preview-pane.
 I would like to use the siunitx latex package. 
 I installed the package doing:
 sudo apt -y install texlive-science
 When I compile my document using directly latex:
 pdflatex mydoc.tex
 it works, but when I&#x27;m within emacs, the latex-preview-pane package cannot compile my document.
 I guess I have to tell emacs and auctex where to find the packages I installed when I installed texlive-science. 
 How can I solve this ?
 PS : I know that the error in latex-preview-pane comes from the \usepackage[siunitx], because if I comment this line, it works perfectly.

Eventually realized that I can just copy the text from pdf into emacs and then format it using emacs macros. Then next task was to convert the transaction lines into ledger entries. This gave birth to &#x60;ob-ledger-convert&#x60; or &#x60;ob-lc&#x60; to provide &#x60;lc&#x60; src blocks in the org mode which when executed convert the given transactions into ledger format. It does need parsers and I have provided some of the parsers used by me in the &#x60;ob-lc&#x60; module. New parsers can be added easily.
 This post is to share the enthusiasm of the emacs being such a fascinating machine which lets you do anything you want and also to get the feedback from the community on the package.
 The sample org file provided in the repo provides a gist of how to use the module.

 i hear a ton about emacs, and the lengths to which people take it, but i don&#x27;t actually know what it can do
 basically all i know is that it&#x27;s a very configurable text editor, but from what I&#x27;ve heard, that description doesn&#x27;t really do it justice.
 so basically, tldr, what makes emacs so good? why do people like it so much?

 But sometimes I can change unrelated parts of a buffer unconciously. Sometimes I delete some part of a buffer, sometimes I copy a huge part of another buffer into this buffer and have a very long extra parts that are hidden under an org heading.
 So the problem is I sometimes change the file in some unwanted way. Most of the time those goes unnoticed and long time I see some inconsistencies with the file itself and how the it should be. I see that the file does not have integrity. This is a bad experience mostly. So I wanted to be able track contents of every save operation I make to the files.

                              <span>For a while now, Tweag has committed in improving various aspects of
Liquid Haskell (LH), a tool that gives the Haskell
programmer both the ability to express properties about programs
and to verify that they meet these expectations.
In this post we present a specific improvement that I integrated
recently, which cuts down the maintenance cost to use LH
when introducing assumptions about functions coming
from large or multiple packages.

Problem: How to reason about dependencies
Let us suppose that we are trying to verify that the following
function yields a non-empty list.
module M where

{-@ consPlus1 :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; { v:[Int] | len v &gt; 0 } @-}
consPlus1 :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
consPlus1 x xs &#x3D; map (+1) (x:xs)

The definition starts with a comment dedicated to LH, delimited by {-@ ..…</span>

 maccalfw
 This is a project born by personal need and mostly for personal use and very much still work in progress, so use at your own discretion. I am still testing it as I had to customize large parts of calfw and calfw-blocks to my liking (working on the interface for modifying and adding events now).
 Bug reports and possible improvements are welcome.
 ​
 A bit of background: I was trying to find ways to view and modify my calendars from within Emacs which lead me down the rabbit hole of figuring out calendar clients for my Google Calendar, my Apple calendar and my work Office365 calendar. Clients for Office365 are particularly annoying with the new Oauth2 system; an app has to be trusted by Microsoft which pretty much means that all open source clients are unusable unless one has admin control over the Azure environment.
 After some pointless struggle, I decided to just rely on my local MacOS calendar app to handle all the authentication and to sync my calendars. I wrote a simple interface in Swift which can be imported in Emacs and then used to feed events into calfw.

                              <span>Hi everybody ! I&#x27;d like to use all the icons with treemacs but I can&#x27;t figure how to do it. I tried (straight-use-package &#x27;treemacs-all-the-icons) I use straight package manager, but it doesn&#x27;t work. I tried (treemacs-load-theme &quot;all-the-icons&quot;) but didn&#x27;t work either. Any ideas ?

                              <span>I am pretty sure i read about use-package now supporting :vc for installing packages from version control. However I cant find anything about it now. Does anybody know about this feature? I checked the github page and my local package is labeled &quot;20230426.2324&quot;. Its installed from melpa (i guess).

                              <span>Just as the title says, Scala&#x27;s community looks very pessimistic on how the language is progressing on the basis of what I read here and from say blog posts.
 Context is that I&#x27;m an AI engineer in R&amp;D. Currently I do just about everything in Python, SQL with a sprinkle of R. I know some Scala 2, Java and C++ as well. To me, Scala always felt like the ideal marriage of having a great type system and not having the annoying things you&#x27;d associate from static typing.
 I think the pessimism hurts adoption as folk like myself become skeptical. That&#x27;s sad because at least in theory the language does exactly what people like me need: a pragmatic yet principled way to make software. Scala 3, especially, looks flexible enough for scripting and interactive stuff with for example polynote. Type safety also reduces the footguns compared to Python.
 It won&#x27;t deter me, I&#x27;ll keep on going but at the very least I wanted to share my thoughts.

 https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/ti-developer-ecosystem-survey-2023
 The last year the Scala community was underrepresented and in result we weren&#x27;t able to say much about the state of Scala. Please help us change it this year. Tell your collegues about it, it in your companies, on the campus, at meetups, etc. We need everyone :)

                              <span>Does the Refined library for Scala (at https://github.com/fthomas/refined; &quot;eu.timepit&quot; %% &quot;refined&quot;) work in Scala 3? Does it work differently?
 I&#x27;m having trouble in migrating some code that uses Refined from Scala 2 to Scala 3.
 The code is:
 import eu.timepit.refined.api.{Refined, RefinedTypeOps}
 import eu.timepit.refined.numeric.Interval.Closed
 object Example {
 type MyType &#x3D; Int Refined Closed[1, 3]
 object MyType extends RefinedTypeOps.Numeric[MyType, Int]
 val good: MyType &#x3D; MyType(1) // 2.13: works
 val bad: MyType &#x3D; MyType(42) // 2.13: correctly fails with error re 42 &gt; 3
 }
 It works fine with Scala 2.13.11 (with dependency &quot;eu.timepit&quot; %% &quot;refined&quot; % &quot;0.11.0&quot;), compiling per the comments.
 However, with Scala 3 (I tried 3.0.0, 3.3.0) the line with good fails compilation with the error &quot;object MyType in object Example does not take parameters&quot;.
 It looks like an apply method implemented using RefineMacro.implApplyRef disappeared for the Scala 3 version of eu.timepit.refined.api.RefinedTypeOps. 
 Does the Scala 3 version still support compile-time validation of literal values to refined types? 
 If so, how? (That is, what do I change &quot;MyType(1)&quot; to in order to have it work in Scala 3?)
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been searching around and I can&#x27;t seem to find an answer. I have a task which has to happen less frequently over time. I want it to start daily, then go twice weekly, then once a week.
 I can&#x27;t find a way to make this set-up work: 
 SCHEDULED:  DEADLINE:  SCHEDULED:  DEADLINE:  SCHEDULED:  
 How do you schedule tasks which have a repeater that has to change over time?

                              <span>By default exporting org-agenda to an .ics file to share it with other calendar apps marks both scheduled and unscheduled todo headings as VTODO items (via org-icalendar-combine-agenda-filescommand). It causes some calendar clients to read them incorrectly by scheduling todo headings with current time or showing scheduled events in a todo list.
 I wrote a systemd .service file (with a bit of help) to switch all scheduled todo headings as VEVENTS and unscheduled as VTODOs. From initial tests it seems to be working correctly on Thunderbird and calcurse.
 It works by checking if an entry in the .ics file uses current time for DTSTART (that&#x27;s what icalendar assigns to unscheduled todo headings). If it does then it should be a VTODO, otherwise a VEVENT.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;d like to introduce you some interesting lists and rankings related to the Scala open source ecosystem:
 - Top Contributors (global or by country): https://opensource-heroes.com/contributors?language&#x3D;scala
 - Trending projects: https://opensource-heroes.com/discover/scala (based on GitHub stars increase)
 - Awesome projects: https://opensource-heroes.com/awesome/scala (we plan to add soon a new feature to allow everyone to contribute to that list directly from the site)
 You can also find &quot;stars&quot; history in the detail page of some repos (it will be available soon for all Scala repos, we&#x27;re still processing some data!) and embed this chart in your README.
 Hope you find this content useful! Any feedback is really appreciated. Please note that be are still in beta 🙏 We want to build a platform that allows everybody to easily explore the open source world! 
 We just released a new &quot;Interviews&quot; section (https://opensource-heroes.com/interviews) with open source contributors explaining their journey, motivations, challenges, tools, ... Tell us your Scala journey!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been really frustrated lately, trying to get black text on white background. I want to I use my e-ink tablet as an external screen when programming out in the sunshine. But it has turned out that something as simple as a high contrast theme with a pure white background and black text is beyond my abilities. 
 For some reason, M-x set-background-color white sets the background to gray when running emacs in a terminal. Even setting the background color to #ffffff results in a gray background (and in me shouting frustrated at the monitor). I can get pure white with xemacs, but I&#x27;m mostly working on our development servers remotely over slow ssh connections, so xemacs is out of the equation. 
 Of the standard themes, whiteboard comes closest, but is also gray background, smudged and hard to read on e-ink. Literally every light theme I&#x27;ve downloaded has been some variant of smudgy yellow, gray or teal for the background. Grayish text on grayish background is virtually illegible on e-ink. 
 I found an &quot;e-ink&quot; theme here: https://emacsthemes.com/themes/eink-theme.html. This gets me black text on a white background... mixed with white text on a white background (#includes and other syntax highlighting), so also not useable. 
 Can it really be that difficult to get real black text on real white background? What is the obvious thing I&#x27;m missing? I&#x27;m happy to have some syntax highlighting in (dark) gray, but the main text needs to be pure black, and most importantly the background should be actual white. 
 Please help, my inability to get something so trivial to work is hurting my self-esteem!

 (cl-function (lambda (&amp;key data &amp;allow-other-keys) (append (list (json-parse-string data)) callback-args))) 
 ​
 the callback-args are defined in the outer scope of this function, how to include it in the current function, already tried
  &#x60;(append (list (json-parse-string data)) ,callback-args) 
 ​

 I really love Magit (as I am sure a lot of people do). One thing that annoys me quite a lot is that, when I run magit-branch-checkout, the list of branches are shown alphabetically I think, when what I really want is the branches to be ordered by my most recent. 
 Any idea on how to achieve this?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>I use tmux on a remote server for persistence. I find it useful to have a multi-term buffer inside my local emacs that is then ssh&#x27;ed into this server and then I can also attach to my persistent tmux session. 
 My question applies even if I skip the tmux step. In my term window I may want to edit a file that is local to the remote. Running emacs in that window, I loose control of emacs shortcuts: everything including closing the remote emacs goes to my emacsclient running on my laptop. Is there a way to solve this? Can I keep my workflow, and edit a file remotely like this? 
 In solving this, I don&#x27;t want to give up on all shortcuts passed to my local emacsclient when I am not editing a file remotely like this.
 This is not the same as running emacs inside multi-term that is running bash locally. For that, I use emacsclient (my local emacs is running as a server) and so I can open any file in my emacs client locally. One solution would be to pass -X to ssh and have a gui running locally.

                              <span>Hello there!
 I am pretty new to emacs and at the moment I try to configure lsp-mode with pylsp. In my understanding I can just use a hook at prog-mode to run lsp (seems to work). The only problem is that emacs wont find pylsp. I allready hacked something together to prepend the emacs intern PATH var (read by using (getenv &quot;PATH&quot;) with the path to the directory which contains the pylsp executable but it just says that it cannot find it. This problem only exists when starting emacs via dmenu and not via a &quot;normal&quot; terminal which uses my zshrc with the appropriate PATH var I guess.
 My config can be found here
 Any help would be appreciated. Have a Great Day!

                              <span>Hi, sorry if theres a huge lack of context. But I am banking on the community expertise. Basically, I started the Emacs journey from Spacemacs, to another programmers (stranger, Kaushal Modi) config (init.el). Im okay with learning slowly at my own pace, and Im learning eLisp at my own pace. I ve been using S- and S- for navigation (same goes for up and down). I was okay for months, but now Im looking to remove that Shift for good. Using hardcore-mode seems to work, but Id have to do it everytime I startup. Setting (hardcore-mode 0) doesnt work.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been making &quot;come-here...&quot; eyes at emacs for a year or more now, but also had a pretty crazy year, which has led to a return to school for a career change. Looking for a good, cross-platform note-taking/workflow thing, and heard about Obsidian, Evernote, Roam, Foam...and came across this thread. Talm&#x27; bout eMacs being able to do a lot of what the new-fangled apps are bragging about. Put it this way - I got a couple months that are kinda-sorta free, so if you&#x27;re telling me this is a valid excuse to run through emacs, I&#x27;m sold. One step closer to achieving true FOSS nerd-dom, after dabbling in it from the edges.
 But, like I said in the title, I&#x27;m mostly a fan of FOSS for ideological reasons, and past recognizing names of things I don&#x27;t actually have that much ability. So, I gotta be that guy and ask for any advice on easy-to-set-up-and-understand emacs-centered solutions to note-taking. Specifically, I need something that I can sync between my Linux Mint laptop and Android, or that I can make sync. Searchable across devices/files is big, too. I can go a step further in being an entitled new guy, if there are any good resources - youtube playlists, blogs, articles, whatever - on something like &quot;designing/customizing workflow for your industry/goals in emacs,&quot; that&#x27;d be cool, too.
 Thanks for bearing w/me, here&#x27;s hoping I&#x27;ll finally be joining this community.

                              <span>Alain M. Lafon described in 2022 a neat way to export org-agenda to .ics (for other calendar clients). However, in emacs 28.3 a lot of his commands seem to be missing. Does anyone know what package provides org-batch-store-agenda-views or org-agenda-export-to-ics ?
 Doom emacs only provides org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files for exporting .ics.
 This command seems necessary to replace VTODO with VEVENT types.
 WORKAROUND: You can just run sed command on the exported .ics instead whenever cron job exports .ics to replace all VTODO with VEVENT: sed -i &#x27;s/VEVENT/VTODO/g&#x27; org.ics

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I&#x27;m looking for here, so this is going to be a bit open-ended. But I was wondering if there was a way to produce statistics on a group of org files. Here are some examples of what I mean.
 Example #1 - Tag Count
 You create TODO items over an entire year. Your TODO&#x27;s all have at least one, but possibly more, tags. Those tags are &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;Spouse&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, and &quot;Fun&quot;, for example. At the end of the year, you want to know how you divided your time. Is there an easy way to produce output like this:
  
Work - 30
 School - 28
 Personal - 24
 Spouse - 20
 Home - 17
 Fun - 11
  
Example #2 - Avg Time
 You spend a year completing tasks. At the end of that year, is there an easy way to display how long tasks took to complete? Maybe broken down by tag?
 I&#x27;m sure there are lots of other ways of summarizing and splicing the various meta data collected, so if anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;m open to it.

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;m a new Emacs user who&#x27;s been using Doom Emacs but I recently decided to switch over to a personal config. One things that I want to do asap is set up a lot of my keybinds to mostly mirror the ones set by Doom. That being said, there are a lot of binds to copy over and I don&#x27;t want to do all of the hard manual labor of setting them all. More specifically, I want to copy over a lot of the useful leader key functionality that Doom sets. For instance, if I were to hit  W in Doom, it would function about the same as if I hit  in evil mode. As of right now, I&#x27;m using the general package to set my binds for the leader key manually but it&#x27;s kind of a pain in the ass, especially for such a massive set of commands like the  or  functionality. Is there a way to either 
 A.) More easily port over most of the keybinds from Doom? (I know a lot of them are package specific but still)
 B.) Easily set certain default Emacs keybinds to other key combinations? (E.g set  W to be equivalent to  and  H to be equivalent to

 I want to switch to use Emacs daemon with the provided systemd user unit emacs.service for quicker startup but if I simply enable and start it, it doesn&#x27;t restore any frames. I see that there&#x27;s this thread which seems to work on restoring a single frame, but how to restore/save multiple frames like my initial setup? Unfortunately I barely know any elisp.
 Much appreciated.

 Many of us know that Emacs defaults for garbage collection are rather ancient and often cause singificant slowdowns. However, it is hard to know which alternative defaults will be better.
 Emacs devs need help from users to obtain real-world data about Emacs garbage collection. See the discussion in https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/87v8j6t3i9.fsf@localhost/
 I wrote a small package https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/emacs-gc-stats.html that will collect garbage collection stats during Emacs sessions. Please, install it and later (after few weeks) submit the results to emacs-gc-stats@gnu.org
 Usage:
 Add
 (require &#x27;emacs-gc-stats) (setq emacs-gc-stats-gc-defaults &#x27;emacs-defaults) ; optional (emacs-gc-stats-mode +1) 
 to your init file to enable the statistics acquiring.
 When you are ready to share the results, run M-x emacs-gc-stats-save-session and then share the saved emacs-gc-stats-file (defaults to ~/.emacs.d/emacs-gc-stats.eld) by sending an email attachment to .
 You can use M-x emacs-gc-stats-clear to clear the currently collected session data.
 The following data is being collected after every command:
  
 GC settings gc-cons-threshold and gc-cons-percentage
  Emacs version and whether Emacs framework (Doom, Prelude, etc) is used
  Whether gcmh-mode is used
  Idle time and Emacs uptime
  Available OS memory (see memory-info)
  Emacs memory allocation/GC stats
  Current command

                              <span>Hey guys
 I have found an issue when update the header line(although I am not sure if this even is an issue).
 While displaying information in the header line, not everything is updated at the same time in the *Messages* buffer.
 Code I used to enable header line in scratch buffer:
 (setq wat 0) (defun initialize-header-line () (interactive) (setq header-line-format &#x27;(:eval (message (format &quot;header line updated %d&quot; (setq wat (+ wat 1))))))) 
 My question is:
 Why is the header line being updated on every key movement, but the *Messages* buffer doesn&#x27;t display the &quot;header line updated&quot; on every key movement? Is this expected?
 I also added a gif screencast to show this issue(sorry for the quality, This is the best that I was able to record):

 Regardless of the outcome of this vote, I would suggest that people use the official Haskell Discourse instead of r/haskell: https://discourse.haskell.org

                              <span>Hi ! I&#x27;m a bit confused with the goal of permanent note in a standard ZK workflow.
Sometimes, I feel it is redundant or useless.
Context: I mainly use note-taking to capture and convert informations into pieces of reusable cards (for technical docs). My main interest are science (physics/math) and computer science (programing/software/web).
What I pretend to know about permanent note
In pure theory, I believe (maybe I&#x27;m wrong ) a permanent note is a card :
that should contain enough text about a specific topic (atomic)
that should contain enough informations to &quot;live alone&quot; (self-contained)
that should be reusable in other topic context (portable)
that should contain links to spread the web
that should contain references to sources (context)
The permenant note, from my head to paper
When I have an idea, I write it down to paper (fleeting note) and I must convert this note into a well-formed, in my own word permanent note.
I am unconfortable with this new permanent note because there is no reference at all.
The permanent note, from books to idea
When I read about literary note (or reference note), it is said I should pick up an interesting passage, write it into my own words and so on.
literary note into multiple &quot;ideas&quot; which are called permanent note.
I really don&#x27;t see the difference between the aggregated permanent note in my literary note.
This feeling is intensified when I write a technical subject (e.g. http).
Maybe I suffer from misconception and you could provide some keys to understand please.
If someone knows about some basic samples of ZK implementations, it would be great !
Thank you !</span>

                              <span>So if I use C-c C-c to execute this then my org-agenda-mode-map correctly shows H-, and H-. with the below listed functions. But when I load the tangled lisp at startup it does not. 
 Getting an error that org-agenda-mode-map is void variable 
 I also tried
  
 both :map commands under 1 :bind heading
 define-key org-agenda-mode-map style of binding (same error)
  
of note after my startup config loads I can run this execute and it executes which seems to me like there is some load issue with the map during the use-package setup but once my config loads I can &quot;rerun&quot; the code block and make it work...not ideal.

                              <span>Orgzly is a popular android client that allows you to edit org files in a feature-rich and intuitive way. However, for over 4 years its syncing mechanism for local repositories (not webdav) suffered from a critical bug.
 If you try to delete a file on one of your machines orgzly (running on another machine) will recreate it - meaning you can&#x27;t ever delete any file in your org-mode directory AND have it synced with orgzly. This makes any form of administration that relies on many disparate files impossible (e.g. org-roam):
 https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/287
 If anyone has any experience with developing on android and would like to support this otherwise great project, this may be a perfect opportunity to do so.
 UPDATE: it is possible that the project might have been abandoned.
 UPDATE2: As mentioned in the comments syncing with WebDAV instead of local directories may not to have this issue. I&#x27;m checking if nextcloud provides encryption when using WebDAV (if someone has already configured it please let me know).

 I am trying to refile a cancelled task under the &#x27;*CANCEL&#x27; heading.
 I want to refile the following task:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 *** CANCELLED Match Figma Templates
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ​
 Remaining File For Context
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 * Jira Tickets
 ** Todo
 ** In Progress
 *** CANCELLED Match Figma Templates
 ** COMPLETE
 ** CANCEL
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 When I hit &#x27;C-c C-w&#x27; to use &#x27;org-refile&#x27;, I can only refile the &#x27;*** CANCELLED Match Figma Templates&#x27; under &#x27;* Jira Tickets&#x27;.
 Is there a related Emacs config variable I can use to allow any level heading?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I tried Chemacs2 but switching to my Org Mode based Emacs config that has a &#x27;config.org&#x27; with &#x27;init.el&#x27; doesn&#x27;t work as easy as just literally using GNU Stow with &#x27;stow -t ~/.emacs.d&#x27;. The problem with that is that I have to constantly wipe out that &#x27;~/.emacs.d&#x27; directory each time, let it install everything, and let &#x27;vterm&#x27; compile again which takes a good 5 mins each time.
 ​
 Goal:
  
I&#x27;m trying to switch between my normal config and the Spacemacs config.
 This is because I&#x27;ve been trying to check out Spacemacs to see what I like from it to later then adapt it with my own config or just use Spacemacs for web dev projects since I hate configuring LSP myself.
  
​
 Questions:
 Q1. Has anyone with an Org Mode based config used anything similar, and if so, what have you used?
 Q2. Or should I somehow add my actual Emacs config to the Spacemacs config too? If so, how?
  
I ask this because there are some quality of life changes I have in my normal Emacs config that annoy me so much for the defaults for Emacs in general, especially with Org mode defaults sometimes.
  
Thanks

                              <span>I built emacs from source, native comp, a few months ago and recently heard about pgtk. Is this worth it (for more smoothness, better user experience) on MacOS? I saw this thread: https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos/issues/45 where it was mentioned that you have to turn off the MacOS specific flag, so I’m not sure if it’s more harm than good, and what benefit it may serve. Anyone have experience optimizing their emacs on MacOS as much as possible? I basically run native comp vanilla emacs with only about 100 lines in my init file, which I byte compile (I’m not sure if the init file byte compilation helps? It seems like even though packages get compiled down natively, going into the native code folder (alongside byte compilations) , init.el doesn’t have an option for it).

                              <span>Hi,
 All-the-icons maintainer here.
 Over the years, all-the-icons have been inundated by user issues about mis-aligning fonts, tofus and font installation or code point clashing problems. This is all the result of cross-pollination of a set of Web front end tricks of a certain era to Emacs.
 The problems of using icon font are
  
They require extra manual installation of fonts
 Amalgamation of different icon fonts designed for different grids and negative spaces result in non-uniform display of fonts
 Code point clashes
 Updating the fonts and their mappings are painful
 Fonts don&#x27;t scale properly even with a lot of manual adjustments
 The project gets an incessant amount of issues opened due to all of the above
  
Since last August, I have been experimenting with simply using the SVG sources of these fonts directly instead, and I&#x27;m happy to announce that I&#x27;m satisfied with the result enough that I want to invite the community to try out the SVG branch.
 There are now over 18000 icons included in the package, and over 31000 when you count all the variations. Chances are, if you are looking for an icon that looks good and appropriate, it&#x27;s probably in there.
 The public API largely remains the same, but there are some backward incompatible changes in the private APIs. Please refer to the README for details.
 Judging from Github searches, these changes do not appear to cause too much breakage, but I could be wrong. Please let me know on Github as I do not plan to come back to Reddit too often because of a certain u/spez.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve repeatedly seen the claim that frequent breaking changes to the language are one reason why Scala isn&#x27;t more widely adopted in the industry. While I can only speak from my personal experience I don&#x27;t really see the point here. It seems to me that other languages and ecosystems get away with big changes:
  
Python&#x27;s adoption has only increased after the infamous 2 -&gt; 3 version change.
 JavaScript itself is backwards-compatible with older versions, but the JS ecosystem keeps changing a lot. For example the industry was happy to adopt React even though it introduces breaking changes with major version updates.
  
What are your takes on this matter? Is feature churn that much higher in Scala? Has language instability been discussed in your organization? Has it impacted any team&#x27;s decision to use or not use Scala? Will the introduction of LTS versions help Scala&#x27;s adoption grow in the long-term or will it just make library maintainers happier?

                              <span>Have you found any way to ignore selecting surrounding formatting characters like:
 *bold*
 &#x3D;code&#x3D;
 ~highlight~
 By default selection seems to include them even when they are toggled off (not shown) in the buffer. Copying such small portions of text frequently to the clipboard can get a bit annoying after a while.
 If you are using evil mode (vim keybindings) key combination v i W will select the entire word and those surrounding characters. It would be nice to find some way to avoid this.

                              <span>Different &quot;flavors&quot; of this question has been asked already:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423127/how-to-view-the-next-days-in-org-modes-agenda
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12517/how-do-i-make-the-timespan-shown-by-org-agenda-start-yesterday
 But this question is about &quot;scrolling&quot; aka &quot;moving agenda view up or down&quot; by adding previous or subsequent days to the view.
 You can change org-agenda-start-day variable, but I&#x27;m not sure how to &quot;regenerate&quot; the view then? There also doesn&#x27;t seem to be an equivalent &quot;org-agenda-end-day&quot;? Perhaps someone knows a better way to approach this?
 SOLUTION: If you are using doom emacs you can &quot;scroll&quot; by showing previous/next &quot;period&quot; with square brackets ([ previous and ] next). Commands are called org-agenda-earlier and org-agenda-later (a bit hard to find).
 If someone still knew how to &quot;scroll&quot; by adding/removing earlier/later days in the current view that would be still very useful.

                              <span>Org-agenda allows you to delete and change scheduled items without opening the files (for example changing days by pressing shift+arrow keys), but changes are not saved to the files yet and get lost when you close the buffers.
 Is there a command to write all committed changes to the corresponding files?
 This question was addressed already on emacs stackexchange: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/477/how-do-i-automatically-save-org-mode-buffers
 The command is org-save-all-org-buffers and is bound by default to C-x C-s
 However what if you have some other org buffers opened that you didn&#x27;t mean to save when editing org-agenda items at the same time?
 Maybe there is something like org-save-all-org-agenda-buffer to only save the buffers edited in org-agenda?

 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/pfro6swpqq6b1.png?width&#x3D;36&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;65a3bbf2d08af6fcad8d47960e224f488f3b2d00
 It is a simple SVG with a number in it. The SVG file looks something like this:
     6   ...   
 I can load it in purescript Halogen:
 import Halogen.HTML import Halogen.Svg.Elements import Halogen.Svg.Attributes loadImage :: forall w i. HTML w i loadImage &#x3D; image [x 0.0, y 0.0, width 36.0, height 36.0, href &quot;assets/my_image.svg&quot;] 
 How can I programmatically change the number &quot;6&quot; in it? Can I modify the VDom in the HTML w i? Any other method? Thanks

                              <span>Hey, the following question might seem pretty silly and unimportant, but I&#x27;m a freak so seriously value something like this. I&#x27;m running on a really powerful desktop setup rn with a 165 Hz referesh rate monitor and right now I am stuck between the choice of Neovim and Doom Emacs for my preferred choice of text editor/productivity program. I really really like the integrated environment and the raw amount of power that Emacs provides, and features like Org mode especially are enticing. I&#x27;ve tried emulating the org-mode experience in Neovim with Neorg but it&#x27;s honestly pitiful in comparison, at least at the very moment. However, the biggest thing that bugs me with Emacs compared to Vim right now is just speed.
 Now, I&#x27;m not talking about startup speed. I know about the Emacs --daemon and Ema…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;m interested in creating forms using org-mode where information entered beneath each heading can be saved to an sqlite database, with each org-mode heading being the column heading for the sql table.
 I am using the emacsql package for saving the information to the database, and so long as the entries are placed in a vector, an emacsql function will be able to save the entries to the sql table.
 With the help of chatgpt, I&#x27;ve found several ways of parsing the org-mode headers and saving the entries within each header to a vector. When I display the vector in emacs, the entries look exactly as I would expect.
 However, when I save them to the database, each entry not only includes the text that I want, but a bunch of elisp code around it that appears to be coding the relative position of the text within the org file. It&#x27;s as if the text has a bunch of Metadata attached to it that is invisible within emacs but becomes visible when taken out of emacs and put into the database. I&#x27;ve tried many different ways but all end with the same outcome.
 It&#x27;s clear that there&#x27;s a problem with the methods im using, so I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has been able to successfully do something like this before or has some suggestions as to why this is happening and how to fix it. Thanks!

Here how to put star buffers out of mind but still include them in the buffer list by putting them at the bottom of your buffers list when using consult-buffer. This example removes star buffers from the main buffer source and creates a new source for them.
 (defvar consult--source-star (list :name &quot;*Star-Buffers*&quot; :category &#x27;buffer :narrow ?s :face &#x27;consult-buffer :history &#x27;buffer-name-history :state #&#x27;consult--buffer-state :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort &#x27;visibility :as #&#x27;buffer-name :include &#x27;(&quot;\\*.&quot;))))) ;; modify buffer source to exclude star sources (setq consult--source-buffer (plist-put consult--source-buffer :items (lambda () (consult--buffer-query :sort &#x27;visibility :as #&#x27;buffer-name :exclude &#x27;(&quot;\\*.&quot;))))) ;; reorder sources and add star source at the end (setq consult-buffer-sources &#x27;(consult--source-hidden-buffer consult--source-modified-buffer consult--source-buffer consult--source-bookmark consult--source-recent-file consult--source-file-register consult--source-project-buffer-hidden consult--source-project-recent-file-hidden consult--source-star)) 
 If you truly want to hide them you can use :hidden per the documentation https://github.com/minad/consult#multiple-sources but I find putting them under recent files good enough.

                              <span>My configuration of Eglot is simple: (use-package eglot :hook (c-mode . eglot-ensure)). And it works for a single c file. But when I use this setup to read the code of NetHack, it doesn&#x27;t work for linting and definition finding (M-.), even though eglot connection has no problem. I observed the same problems when reading the code of SQLite. Some specific problems I observed:
 for #include &quot;hack.h&quot;
  
clang [pp_file_not_found]: &#x27;hack.h&#x27; file not found
  
for boolean known;
  
clang [unknown_typename]: Unknown type name &#x27;boolean&#x27;
  
I think the problem may be due to a mismatch of C version between the code and clangd. But how can I tell clangd to check a specific version of C (eg. C99)?
 (Edit) I just tried to use &#x60;c-ts-mode&#x60;, and for some reason the linting issues went away but I still cannot jump using (M-.).
 (Edit 2) It seems that the problems in SQLite source code went away when I use c-ts-mode.
 (Edit 3) Still have the following problem when I use (M-.) in NetHack code:
  
No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point

                              <span>Has anyone tried building Emacs for iPad by targeting WASM, which can run on the JavaScriptCore framework? Applications such as a-Shell already provide a terminal environment for running WASM binaries. Running Emacs locally on your iPad has many benefits compared to running it on a remote host.
 One of the challenges with cross-compiling Emacs is the dumping. Perhaps a way around that is to just use “temacs”, which avoids the dumping step.

                              <span>Recently, I tried to use Eglot + pyright on Django project.
 But pyright doesn&#x27;t works as expected, can not get completion on when import django.db.model
 Any one known how to make pyright works with Django?
 Steps to reproduce:
 ​
  
setup project
  
​
 mkdir django-project cd django-project python3 -m venv ./.venv .venv/bin/python3 -m pip install django source .venv/bin/activate django-admin startproject CoreRoot . django-admin startapp core python manage.py migrate python manage.py runserver 
  
Install Pyright
  
sudo npm install -g pyright
  
Install pyvenv for activate virtual environment in Emacs
 (use-package pyvenv :hook (python-mode . pyvenv-mode) :config (setq pyvenv-post-activate-hooks (list (lambda () (setq python-shell-interpreter (concat pyvenv-virtual-env (if (eq system-type &#x27;windows-nt) &quot;scripts/python&quot; &quot;bin/python&quot;)))))))
 
Start Emacs and open the file: django-project/core/models.py
 
M-x pyvenv-activate and choose the .venv directory
 
M-x eglot, and choose pyright-langserver
 
Try some example code in django-project/core/models.py as below:
 from django.db import models
 class Person(models.Model): first_name &#x3D; models.CharField(max_length&#x3D;30) last_name &#x3D; models.CharField(max_length&#x3D;30)
 
You find that you can&#x27;t get completion for &quot;CharField&quot;, see pictures as below:
 
 ​
 can get models
 ​
 Can not get CharField
 ​
 9 . I also tried python-language-server(pylsp), it can get completion but the server is a little slow, I can feel delay while input characters.
 ​
 works as expected with pylsp
 You can test with this example project: https://github.com/Eason0210/django-project.git
 My personal Emacs config: https://github.com/Eason0210/.emacs.d
 my Emacs version:
 GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin22.5.0, NS appkit-2299.60 Version 13.4 (Build 22F66), git sha1 8657afac774) of 2023-06-16

                              <span>Recently I have been doing some programming in python. I have got it working nicely in Emacs - I may share my configuration another time.
 I&#x27;m have a problem with imports though. In Python you bring in a library by &quot;importing&quot; it. I often have to edit libraries that are part of the project I&#x27;m working on. The problem is that in Python 3 you can&#x27;t unload a library, nor can you replace it with a newer version.
 This is a problem because Emacs python-mode is based around the idea of sending python code to a python shell. This works fine unless imports get involved. Once imports get involved you run into the problem that python will never re-import a library after it has imported it once. So, if you&#x27;re editing a library the only way to update to the new version (which could be what you just wrote) is to stop the python process and start another one.
 Is there a fix for this? Has anyone written a package to at least make constantly restarting python more convenient?

                              <span>I am currently using C++ in Emacs with lsp-mode. I use CMake to generate compile_commands.json with set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON).
 So far, this has been working great -- until I had to write template implementation files:
 Refresher: 
  
In non-templated C++, #include &quot;header.hpp&quot; goes at start of implementation.cpp file.
 
In templated C++, #include &quot;implementation.tpp&quot; goes at end of header.hpp file. 
 
 Basically, since implementation.tpp doesn&#x27;t explicitly &quot;include&quot; its header definitions, the LSP thinks I am just writing out things without defining them, resulting in a bunch of squiggly lines.
 I know a lot of people just put their template implementation code in the header file, but I really want to keep it separate. Have any C++ users encountered this problem before and found a solution? Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 I&#x27;m new to ZIO and currently exploring the concepts of ZIO environment, ZLayers, and ZEnvironment. As I delve into the ZIO documentation and source code, I feel like I&#x27;m missing a few pieces to fully grasp how they fit together. I&#x27;d greatly appreciate your insights in helping me form a complete picture.
 ​
 In the &#x60;ZIO[R, E, A]&#x60; effect, the type parameter &#x60;R&#x60; is referred to as the environment type or the ZIO environment of type &#x60;R&#x60;. The ZIO environment can be constructed by composing ZLayers. By using accessor methods provided by the ZIO datatype, we can access the ZIO environment of a specific type to execute the effect.
 ​
 Here&#x27;s where I am seeking clarification: Is it correct to say that ZIO constructs the ZIO environment of the required type &#x60;R&#x60; from the ZIO environment built by composing the layers? The ZIO environment constructed from the layers will have a different type, but ZIO effects need a specific ZIO environment of a particular type.
 ​
 Furthermore, I am curious about the role of ZEnvironment in all of this. How does it fit into the overall picture?
 ​
 I am grateful for any insights or explanations you can provide to help me better understand these concepts and their interactions.
 ​
 Thank you in advance!

You can do it interactively with (delete-other-windows), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work from terminal: (progn (org-capture) (delete-other-windows)) .
 There were a few attempts to do it already in 2013:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15253005/in-emacs-org-mode-how-do-i-get-org-capture-to-open-in-a-full-sized-window
 in 2015:
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21195327/emacs-force-org-mode-capture-buffer-to-open-in-a-new-window
 and in 2018:
 https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/46460/org-capture-frame-with-no-splits
 None of which seem to work in 2023 (doom) emacs. Has anyone by any chance recently configured this and would be kind enough to share it? Or are you using org-capture in a completely different way that skips this problem altogether? Or are you using some other package for quick note taking?

                              <span>Whenever I take a course, all the relevant material is spread across multiple platforms: Moodle, Microsoft Teams, personal websites, boards from the previous years...
 Every time I start a new course I have to navigate across all these pages and archive everything that I could possibly need: slides, assignments, exams from previous years, etc...
 However, there are a bunch of issues:
  
Storing everything in the file system is a mess: not everything can be stored as a file. Some things (like an online quiz) are meant to be stored as simple bookmarks. This heterogeneity breaks the purpose of &quot;having only one place to look at&quot; for me
 
Given &quot;exam-2-4-2005.pdf&quot;, I&#x27;d like to write some information related to it: whether i have already done it, and the solution. Sometimes the solution is on paper, so all I need to write is a simple number that corresponds to the page on my paper notebook.
 
 Using org mode, I can link both local files and Http URLs (also pdf pages!). I could also write notes related to each one of them.
 Does any of you have a similar workflow in your Emacs routine? Is there some suggestion or package that could aid me for this purpose? This is the first time I use org for something beyond note taking, so I really do not have any &quot;concrete&quot; idea on how to achieve all this.

                              <span>Has anyone seen any form of customization that allowed you to add a timestamp when creating next item in a list or new heading? For example:
  
[2023-06-17 14:21:23] This and that has been said...
 [2023-06-17 14:21:57] And then that other thing...
  
Yas snippet or org-time-stamp commands let you add a timestamp anywhere in the document, but it may get tedious with larger lists. Ideally there would be some way for a timestamp to be bound to the new item creation? Would you just add a yasnippet to a new keybinding (for example Ctrl+Shift+RET)? If anyone has such an example in their config I would really appreciate it.

                              <span>I m using Doom Emacs and am converting an existing program to an Org mode literate style format with a TOC etc. so as to make clear whats going on. When I insert headings code blocks are automatically indented - which is what I want - but white arrows appear for each indentation and these are overlayed with gray blocks (a bit like Visual blocks), which I don&#x27;t want. Nothing I have tried seems to get rid of either the arrows or the gray blocks. Is there some function that shuts this off as it&#x27;s visually really distracting? Thx in advance... 
 P.S. The white arrows might be difficult to see under the gray block but they are there sure enough!

                              <span>ChatGPT and I collaborated on a Visual Studio Code extension to display a list of markdown files by their H1 header. The extension is called Zettel View, and it contributes a Zettlr-like display of Zettels to the VS Code Explorer View, as shown below.

Clicking on any file in the Zettel View window opens the Zettel markdown file in an editor window and causes the file explorer to highlight the selected file.  Since I installed the &quot;Auto-Open Markdown Preview&quot; VS Code extension, the markdown preview of the selected Zettel also appears.
The Zettel View extension for VS Code is available on my GitHub account.
Zettel View makes some assumptions about Zettels. First, Zettels are markdown files with the extension .md. Second, a markdown file&#x27;s H1 or level-one header has the form # ID TITLE (the ID is to the left; some prefer the ID on the right). Third, ID matches a regular expression specific to my ID scheme. Fourth, ID.md is the filename of the Zettel markdown file with the header # ID TITLE.
The second and third assumptions are hard-coded but could be made configurable in later versions of the extension. The fourth assumption isn&#x27;t enforced: a mismatch between ID.md and the filename will appear as a discrepancy between the Zettel selected in the Zettel View and the file explorer. A warning will be emitted in that case.
Zettr has the built-in configuration setting, &quot;Display files using first heading level 1 if available.&quot; A community plugin for Obsidian called &quot;File Explorer Markdown Titles&quot; once produced a similar display in the Obsidian file explorer. Unfortunately, that plugin no longer works with newer versions of Obsidian. Since VS Code is more valuable for my work than Obsidian, it made more sense to develop a VS Code extension than to modify the plugin to work with the current Obsidian API. I plan to move to VS Code the Pandoc and LaTeX integration I configured in Zettlr.</span>

 * TODO Task 1 * TODO Task 2 * TODO Task 3 
 After some time you complete these tasks and want to add new ones. Where do you add them? Do you add them to the same file? Do you create a new file after the first one gets too big? Do you manually perform clean up of the file every so often?
 It may be unrelated, but I&#x27;m wondering how do you add new entries? I imagine that if file gets really big opening and navigating it may get slow after some time. Do you have custom capture templates for that? Do you manually open that file navigate to the top or bottom and add entries there?
 There seems to be a lot of manual processes involved here, which I assume people have figured out how to automate already, but I can&#x27;t quite find out where.
 In org agenda calendar view there is some mention of a &quot;diary file&quot; - is that the place where these entries should be stored instead of organizing them manually?

                              <span>Hi,
 elisp noob here...
 I am setting a variable depending on the hostname and have this in my init.el:
 ;; here is code that sets mh/org-dir (setq org-agenda-files mh/org_dir) (cd mh/org_dir) 
 the cd works but when I try to open the agenda I get &quot;org-agenda-files cannot be a single directory&quot;.
 My question now: If you have the name of a directory in a variable: how do you add all the org-files in that directory to the agenda?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 in this blog post I wrote back in 2018, I had described how to set up a function for org-mode in EMACS, that allows you to take screenshots and include them in your org-file with just one move. An example application looks like this: GIF
 There is now a new version of the function with improved interface and functionality, you can find it in the post above, or directly in the gitlab repo. The corresponding snippet can be found here.
 Hope it helps, I&#x27;m looking forward to any kind of feedback.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Does anyone have this working, I want to use consult-ripgrep package and I guess the package offers a search mechanism for org files within OrgRoam directory..
 I am missing a search parameter using this config because key binding works but rg does not return anything because nothing was captured from typed-in string: Therefore ARG and OPTS must be replaced by something ? Otherwise 
 (use-package consult)
 (defun tomek/org-roam-rg-search ()
 &quot;Search org-roam directory using consult-ripgrep. With live-preview.&quot;
 (interactive)
 (let ((consult-ripgrep &quot;rg --null --ignore-case --type org --line-buffered --color&#x3D;always --max-columns&#x3D;500 --no-heading --line-number . -e ARG OPTS&quot;))
 (consult-ripgrep org-roam-directory)))
 ​
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c rr&quot;) &#x27;tomek/org-roam-rg-search)

 I hope you&#x27;re all having a great day. I&#x27;m a newbie to Emacs, and I&#x27;ve been doing some exploring to find the best fit for me. I started with Spacemacs, but to be honest, it felt overwhelming, and I couldn&#x27;t get all its spirit.
 Then, I gave Doom Emacs a shot, and I was simpler, yet it still seems to have all the functionality I need. For me, doom-emacs offers me a great experience, though. 
 That said, I have a minor concern. I noticed they released the last significant update back in March. More concerning, though, is that there seem to be quite a few unanswered pull requests, some of which appear to be pretty important in terms of features or fixes.
 So, in my complete ignorance, I first want to ask you guys experts about the situation. 
 Is Doom Emacs still being actively maintained? If not, what do you think is the best way, return to Spacemacs or try another configuration kit? 
 Thanks for your insights and suggestions. 
 Best.

                              <span>Hi guys! I want to export a certain company/project TODO list I am working on, to a CSV file, in order to produce a shareable ongoing progress report of my work onlne. I&#x27;ve gotten the Emacs built in macro org-batch-agenda-csv working somewhat using a command like this:
 (org-batch-agenda-csv &quot;MYTAG1|MYTAG2&quot;)
 Where I&#x27;m struggling is with date/time information. I assumed that if my TODOs have a typical SCHEDULED attribute that i&#x27;d easily discover date/time info in the generated csv. So far, no such luck.
 The help for org-batch-agenda-csv macro talks about optional (rest) Parameters that &quot;are alternating variable names and values that will be bound before running the agenda command.&quot; This sounds extremely useful but I&#x27;m not sure how to proceed without perhaps examples of how these could be used for some typical uses.
 There are also a handful of references to date/time things in both the Emacs online help for the macro, and in the elisp macro definition. I am not an Emacs Lisp expert though and so far my randomish trial and error has gone nowhere.
 Can you help?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Crossposting from github, because the response rate there has been pretty slow: https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server/discussions/730
 So,
 I&#x27;m writing an application using vanilla js + WebGL and my development stack is:
  
emacs
 lsp-mode
 company-mode
 ts-ls installed through emacs
  
My LSP config is here, and I&#x27;m open to suggestions for improving it.
 Completion works fine for the core parts of javascript, e.g. getElementByID() and friends. But if I want to call into, let&#x27;s say, the canvas API, I don&#x27;t have completion working. Here&#x27;s an example:
 var canvas &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;foo&quot;); var ctx &#x3D; canvas.getContext(&quot;bar&quot;); 
 screenshot
 Note how the getContext isn&#x27;t offered by the language server as a completion option.
 Here&#x27;s a second example:
 xmlr &#x3D; new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlr.open(&#x27;GET&#x27;, url, false); 
 Similarly, the open isn&#x27;t offered as a completion option.
 How do I fix this? I&#x27;ve tried setting both a tsconfig.json and a jsconfig.json with the following contents:
 { &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: { &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es2020&quot;, &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;es2020&quot;], &quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot; } } 
 But no dice. I still don&#x27;t get completion in the examples above.
 What do?

                              <span>Today I finally found a few hours to implement 2 features from swiper that I missed in consult-line:
 ​
  
Smart recenter: buffer is recentered only if you jump to match outside of current view. (This can be done in a pretty non-invasive way via hooks)
 Highlighting of matches on all visible lines in buffer. This is a noticeable patch to core consult code. Instead of creating a patch/fork, I just put into a separate file which I load after consult itself, it redefines quite a few core functions. It might break with newer consult versions.
  
​
 Feel free to try: https://gist.github.com/lazy/4f609cf2b956de2531885747e3c3bf88
 Save it to &quot;consult-patch.el&quot; file, open in emacs, M-x eval-buffer, run consult-line, search for something like &quot;let&quot; and enjoy.
 ​
 UPD: gist was updated at least once. Overlay caching didn&#x27;t move overlays between windows. Now it doef.
 ​
 P.S. I saw another approach to doing that: https://github.com/minad/consult/pull/774. But minad decided not to merge it due to perf and personal preference. Mine is a little better performance-wise: it checks for highlighting only visible candidates and caches the highlight overlays (of which there can be many). But I am not sure if I will be able to overcome minad&#x27;s personal preference, so don&#x27;t want to bother with PR. If someone wants to polish this code and try merge into mainline, I won&#x27;t mind. Think of this code as &quot;public domain&quot;.
 P.P.S. I don&#x27;t use swiper because I have quite a lot of custom vertico/vertico-posframe/consult configuration which I do not want to replicate for swiper.

                              <span>Hello,
 I gave a quick run around the posts about emacs server/daemon and I have a couple of questions
  
If you don&#x27;t put any special arguments by default and you run emacs --daemon this will have a Unix socket right? Which means that both server and client will be on localhost.
 You can also specify a TCP socket allowing the server and the client to live on separate hosts. Is this right?
 Finally, if and when this happens when you edit files with emacsclient do you edit files on the client side or on the server side? Would this be a good use for editing files both on the server and the client? Or you should have something separate to edit files on the server? i.e. use git or ssh or nextcloud
  
Thank you very much for your help.

                              <span>I often browse though tweets using the nitter.net site, which is basically a scrape of the text and images on twitter.com. 
 Over the past month or so, images in tweets shown in nitter have stopped displaying in EWW, but can be seen on an external browser like Firefox. 
 For instance, in this tweet, there is a profile picture and an embedded .jpg image of a football/soccer player which both show up in Firefox. However, when viewed in EWW only the poster&#x27;s profile picture is shown. This is not the case for images that show up as &quot;previews&quot; of webpages, e.g. in this tweet, both the profile picture and the previewed image of aircraft from the article both show up in EWW.
 I thought this issue would explain why, but the images I see in Firefox are .jpg, not webp. This might still be a nitter issue, but I would be interested to understand why this has happened.

                              <span>I am starting a process via start-process-shell-command. The command starts server, and is actually never &quot;finished&quot; as the server is continuously running. However, one can infer when this command is finished, that is to say when the server is up and running, by looking at the output (i.e. when the string &quot;Server is running!&quot; is observed in the output).
 I want to code up an Elisp function that calls the command, wait until the server is up and running, and only then execute the next step. How would I best do this?
 My current method is check the relevant process-buffer every 0.5 sec (with sleep-for) to see if the known regex pattern is observed, however this seems a bit sub-optimal. In particular I am unable to use Emacs until the pattern is observed (even though my process is async).
 I have tried to read up on process filters as my understanding is that they are functions which receive output from processes, but I can&#x27;t figure out a way to &quot;wait&quot; until the regex pattern is observed via filters.
 Does anyone have any idea how to reliably achieve this, or any pointers on where I should look to understand process filters better to get to my solution?

 I will be deleting my profile so I also wanted to thank you all for the inspiration and for helping me to solve my problems in my Emacs journey.
 So, thank you all, my fellow Emacsers. &#x3D;]

                              <span>I haven’t really used emacs too much yet, but I love the idea of using it for taking notes and organizing my life with org mode. Funny enough, I feel like I’m procrastinating organizing my life cause I’m thinking “wait I need to get org mode set up first”.
 The problem is, I’ve seen people say it takes YEARS to understand emacs and that it has an incredibly high learning curve. I wouldn’t mind using something like doom or centaur, but at the same time, it seems weird to use a preconfigured editor and not understand what’s going on underneath the hood, especially if there’s an issue and I don’t know how to fix it. You think that’s a big deal or is using those preset editors perfectly fine? I’m looking to use vim bindings so I wonder if I should just stay with doom.
 I’m planning on reading “Mastering Emacs”, working through the built in tutorial, the elisp tutorial (maybe, but it seems weird to not understand the language the entire applications is built and configured in), and maybe Emacs from Scratch and the org mode udemy tutorial by Rainer Konig.
 After all that maybe I’ll know enough to build my own config, or at least understand a lot of what goes on in doom or centaur or something.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 ​
 I am trying to generate a report from an org file with R code blocks.
 ​
 Blocks are defined such as:
 ​
 #+begin_src R :results output round(cov(phenmz1),3) #+end_src 
 ​
 And I have an option at the header:
 #+PROPERTY: exports both 
 Now, when I run org-html-export-to-html, code is run but the contents of the code block are substituted with nilbody.
 ​
 - What is likely the issue with this case?

                              <span>Given an org-file with visibility cycled such that certain sections are folded, how would one search and replace in the unfolded text only. E.g. in org file below, how would I do a search and replace on the lines Foo2 and Foo3 only?
 I&#x27;ve tried cycling visibility to show level one headers only and doing a visual selection of line Foo2 and Foo3 then using regexp-replace and :s/... but in both cases the replacement takes place on the folded lines under Foo2 and Foo3 too.
 * Foo1 ** Sub * Foo2 ** Sub * Foo3 ** Sub * Foo4 ** Sub 
 UPDATE Setting search-invisible to nil prior to the replacement, works as long as 1) I use regexp-replace, and 2) the search is for plain text (not a regexp) only. 
 If I search for $ then neither regexp-replace nor :substitute work.
 UPDATE 2 Oopsie, I predominantly use spacemacs

                              <span>Langchain significantly accelerates the development of large language models (LLMs). I&#x27;m curious if Scala can offer suitable implementations, based on its language features, to make the development of asynchronous streaming text applications easier, just like popular older Scala projects in the field of big data.
 AI and LLM have made Python great again; perhaps Scala can demonstrate its power in new domains.
 P.S. I&#x27;m currently working on a closed-source Java-lang project for our LLM project, built on Reactor. Just asking for fun.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s the 1.0.0 version of FxCalculator
 It&#x27;s, well, a calculator for your Android phone.
 It&#x27;s got all the usual buttons with numbers and operators, and also parentheses as well as buttons for storing the partial results of your calculations to the memory.
 But that&#x27;s not all. It also has an advanced editor hidden under the &quot;Fx&quot; button. In that mode, you can write an expression with your virtual keyboard, as if you were writing simple programming code. You can use variables and functions from a list, combine them, and even write your own custom ones. They will be stored on the phone so they can be actually useful to you more than once.
 And, on top of that, FxCalculator was written in Scala 3, with JavaFX, Gluon, and GraalVM Native Image. For now it&#x27;s available only as APK stored on GitHub. You can install it by allowing 3rd party APK installation on your Android, clicking the link above on your phone, and then downloading and installing the APK from there.
 I will try to push the app to the Google store and create a better looking webpage for it later this year.

                              <span>As a follow-up to this old thread, I am pleased to announce the first release of the Kreuzberg Library.
 The library&#x27;s primary purpose is to simplify the creation of declarative ScalaJS components.
 The concept is straightforward:
  
Components can subscribe to models, which contain some state.
 Components declare event bindings (e.g., click events) that, in turn, modify models.
 If a model changes, the components emit new HTML (including event bindings and sub-components).
 The new HTML gets rendered.
  
Additionally, Channels are included, which offer n:m communication and can be incorporated into event bindings (as sources and sinks).
 HTML rendering can be performed via Scalatags and Scala XML, but other mechanisms can also be implemented.
 The rendering engine can be changed. Currently, there are two simple client-side engines available: a simple imperative, and a ZIO-Based.
 A proof-of-concept RPC system is also available. You can declare a trait for a service, and macros will generate a stub for the client (ScalaJS) app and dispatcher code for the server side. In the examples, this is used to implement a TODO app with server-side storage.
 Components, Models, and Channels are identified by IDs, which are currently auto-incremented. This isn&#x27;t entirely functional. I&#x27;ve experimented with other ideas, like creating IDs via a State-Monad, but they ended up being less practical.
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on this.

                              <span>If you’re a Haskell developer, it’s likely you’re already familiar
with the concept of property-based testing, and have first hand
experience with a framework like QuickCheck or hedgehog. You might
also have heard of the term “fuzzing” in various places, and it sounds
just like what we’ve already been doing for so long, right? Just
generate a bunch of random test inputs, in the hope of exposing an
unknown bug?
Well, actually there’s more to it than that! Recently, I had some fun
exploring coverage-guided fuzzers like AFL++ and libFuzzer. Along
the way, I discovered a simple trick that allows us to compile Haskell
code in a manner that these fuzzers can handle. The experience was
akin to unlocking a hidden skill. I can say, without a doubt, that
coverage-guided fuzzing can work wonders. Thi…</span>

 ( (auto-mode-alist . ( (&quot;\\.cfg\\&#x27;&quot; . sh-mode) )) (sh-mode . ( (sh-basic-offset . 2) (fill-column . 80) )) ) 
 When I open some.cfg in emacs, conf-mode is selected. But if I do M-x sh-mode after that, the sh-mode settings from .dir-locals.el are applied (the sh-basic-offset and fill-column).
 Why it ignores the auto-mode-alist clause? My emacs is from ubuntu 22.04 repositories, version 27.1+1-3ubuntu5.
 Yes, I tried starting it with the -q option, the behavior is the same.

 At the moment I see i&#x27;m getting 1 row of dots and they&#x27;re coming in as black, randomly. Can someone point me in the right direction to get back to this?

                              <span>whenever I open emacs, it has some buffers from the previous session which sometimes may contain pdfs or large files that slow down the startup time, how to prevent that behavior ?
 I think it is due to some persp-mode configuration but I don&#x27;t know what variable it is

Tried lsp c++ that included helm and I &#x27;effin hated helm ... for the first 30 seconds. Then I tried it again - and after minor mental adjustments - I realize it&#x27;s the best addition to my toolkit in the past several years!!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m new on Emacs and I&#x27;m trying to use Elixir with Emacs
 I installed the elixir-mode M-x package-install [RET] elixir-mode [RET]
 https://github.com/elixir-editors/emacs-elixir
 and added
 (load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa/elixir-mode-2.4.0/elixir-mode.el&quot;) (require &#x27;elixir-mode) 
 to ~/.emacs
 But elixir&#x27;s files are still in fundamental mode, I guess I&#x27;m missing something ?
 Thank you for your help :)
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you the problem is solving :)
 I added this in ~/.emacs
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) 
 and installed elixir-mode via M-x list-packages who created elixir-mode-20221017.2044 folder and now it&#x27;s working :)

                              <span>I released a first version of khalorg. It is an interface between org and khal cli calendar. I mainly use it to synchronise my outlook agenda with org by using: davmail + vdirsyncer + khal + khalorg. It sure is a niche but who knows, maybe it is useful to someone 😀. 
 I use org with neovim, instead of Emacs. So the package khalel was not useful for me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a custom quicksort method and I need it to be able to sort a sequence of any type, as long as the type has a &quot;&lt;&quot; operator (it is comparable). I would have thought this is something done commonly but I&#x27;m having issues. At first I made the method like so:
 partitionInPlace[A &lt;: Ordered[A]] (...
 But it turns out common AnyVal types such as Int and Double don&#x27;t extend Ordered, so that&#x27;s not suitable. They extend Ordering but that&#x27;s not quite the same and it seems silly to use a function such as &quot;gteq&quot; instead of a simple operator.
 I have a feeling the solution is some kind of implicit conversion? Please help, I&#x27;m kind of new to Scala and I&#x27;m sure this is a common issue.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;ve been programming in Java but wanted to try something new from the ecosystem and chose Scala. However, I&#x27;ve encountered a major problem. Sbt starts syncing my projects but never finishes. I even let it run for entire day and nothing happened.
 I&#x27;ve tried basic troubleshooting: reinstalling IntelliJ Idea (2023.1.2), running different versions of sbt ( 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.2, 1.7.3 ), reinstalling Scala (2.13.19 and 2.13.17), disabling Windows Defender, installing different JDKs (19, 17, 11, 1.8), removing .lock, file, checking logs - they are empty. I even upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 11.
 I know that Scala works better on Linux, but I tested a similar scenario on my friend&#x27;s Windows 10 laptop and it worked like a charm. 
 Here&#x27;s screenshot of my last attempt:
 https://preview.redd.it/28f2b7ajou5b1.png?width&#x3D;1232&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;30ef0f584998bae20641a352c08ee6307dcc70a3
 Honestly, i have no idea what else I can do. I&#x27;ve read through many GitHub issues for sbt and nothing has helped. Has anyone else encountered simillar problem? Any tips or suggestions on what I can do next would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I really like this language, and once a project is set up that&#x27;s fine. But setting up a project just to the point where you can write a simple hello world function trips me up for days. Is there somewhere that guides through this complex process so I can get started easier?

                              <span>I am in the midst of thinking about my overall workflow, may even setup a Linux box to use for work (right now on Mac).
 I&#x27;ve been using Obsidian for notes, it kinda works. But have been thinking about Org mode for a while now for both my personal notes and work notes.
 Generally, I&#x27;m assigned to a project/client for a period of time. I have thought about creating an org folder in home then a org/client for the client or project then something like: - meetings.org for meetings and calls - notes.org for client or project specific notes - tickets.org for any sort of ticketing system they use to help keep track of those without having to login to the ticket system.
 TODOs would of course roll up to Org Agenda.
 More general notes would be in the main Org file.
 Any tips or thoughts on how to manage a similar workflow? Open to ideas.
 I would setup some capture templates to make it easier to add data to these. Maybe even org-roam at some point.
 I would have to start small and expand as I go. Just working on thinking through the mental model. I plan to start working on reading the org manual, any other recommended resources would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, I have looked at the syntax of the org-mode table but I haven&#x27;t found a way to add percentage proportions on each field. For example assuming my table has 3 fields - name, assgn1, assgn2 and I want to sum the assignments (assgn1, assgn2) but each one has a different gravity, for example, assgn1 65% the other 35% so both sum to 100 but with different proportion. I have tried unsuccessfully, given my understanding but not with much luck: TBLFM: $5&#x3D;vsum($2/(100\*65)..$4/(100\*35))

 Unfortunately org-download doesn&#x27;t allow PDFs or other files. Anyone aware of a way to make drag-and-drop attachments work like org-download?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a working(!) org-capture extension for org-protocol. It&#x27;s Firefox-only at the moment but I&#x27;m happy to accept patches to support Chromium based browsers. I wrote it because none of the current extensions/bookmarklets were all that usable (security popups, no hotkeys, etc.).
 Features include:
  
Hotkeys. One for storing links, one for capturing the page (or selected text, if there&#x27;s a selected region).
 Context menu items for capturing: 
 A link to the current page, along with a description pulled from the page&#x27;s metadata.
 Selected text. Optionally, selections can be captured as HTML. You&#x27;ll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.
 Media (images, video, etc.). Media can be (optionally) downloaded (through your browser&#x27;s download manager) before capturing.
 
 A browser action button to perform some default action on click (can either store a link to the current page, or initiate a capture).
 Optionally, capturing a selection will capture the HTML itself. You&#x27;ll want to use this with something like org-protocol-capture-html to translate the HTML to org mode.

                              <span>Hi, I am bit new to this JVM world started learning both Java and Scala. I mainly work in Python. I use pyspark alot but started look at Spark with scala. Every video I see of Java vs Scala, it always scala is functional language while Java is Object oriented. But as java is evolving it has added functional programming in java 8. Do you think there are some features it is lacking that scala has which java will add in future?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Does anyone know what are the closest alternatives to functional scala using cats effect or zio?
 Do any other languages (that companies hire for) allow the same effect driven monad\IO FP style? 
 From what I&#x27;ve seen, haskell is the closest alternative, but I was wondering if there are others I&#x27;m not aware of.
 I really like the style of developing that scala with cats effect\zio allows, but I think it might be a good idea to look into another language(s) that encourages this style\methodology too, in order to increase the amount of potential companies I can apply to. 
 Many thanks.

                              <span>Hi ! 
 Everything is in the title :) 
  
did you experimen with the feature ? 
 what do you think of it ? 
 any lib using them rn ? or example projet ? I would be extra interested in error handling examples 
  
I&#x27;ve started playing around with boundaries and breaks for the fun of it with the objective of implementing an async/await ( but I guess dotty-cps-async existing and looking great kinda killed my motivation ^^ ) and making scala more Rust-like with Result and &quot;nice&quot; ( all a matter of perspective folks, don&#x27;t burn me to the stakes yet ) overloadings with .? and .! . Very rough right now though
 I&#x27;d welcome any suggestion if you have a lookt at mine, and would very much like to see yours !

I am wondering what type of element : is, so I can adapt this code for my goal. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 against my expectations, I have oauth2ms working in retrieving my mails using mbsync. After much finagling it works as advertised. But msmtp, not so much. I can send mails via thunderbird and k9 using office365 smtp and oauth , but msmtp says no.
 Does anybody have some tips to throw ny way perhaps ?
 thx. S
 edit: yes, yes it is possible:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; defaults tls on tls_starttls on logfile ~/.cache/msmtp.log
 account mymail host smtp.office365.com user xxx@xxx from xxx@xxx tls_certcheck on auth xoauth2 passwordeval &quot;oauth2ms -e xxx@xxx&quot; port 587 tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 turns out, I had the token stored with encryption and forgot to add the -e xxx@xxx argument....

                              <span>Today I watched a video where it looked like the youtuber was using XEmacs (it was not the topic of the video, so it wasn&#x27;t mentioned), so I went to XEmacs site to see if there had been any updates, and it turns out, there was a release around a month ago!
 I had used XEmacs in the early 2000s, before Emacs 21 or 22, don&#x27;t remember. But one of the things I liked more, was that help buffers and other popup windows, get focused straight away, so they are easier to navigate and to close, just by using the normal movement keys and q. I always thought it was much nicer than the default in GNU Emacs, where the popup window is not focused so you use C-M-v and C-M-V to scroll it and C-x 1 to get rid of the help window.
 After a short period of XEmacs, I brought with me that XEmacs behavior for help buffers to GNU Emacs. I&#x27;ve been doing that for more than 20 years.
 Well, from the XEmacs changelog: 
  
Improve: Help buffer behaviour synced with GNU (Mats Lidell)
  
I laughed so hard :D

My personal choice is Rotor theme, i&#x27;ve always been a fan of dark themes, until my eyesight deteriorated significantly, so i found the ideal light theme for me - rotor theme. Take a look:

                              <span>Hi All,
 I am wrassling with outlook365 and I want to move from thunderbird to mu4e and I have finally been able to get mbsync to login and download the mails. However, with thunderbird I have set up an Archives/[YEAR] subfolders structure that I have used for years with my personal mail that also works as advertised in mu4e.
 But with outook365 I get :
 IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2022 (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Archives/2023 (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/Birthdays (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) IMAP warning: ignoring mailbox Calendar/United States holidays (reserved character &#x27;/&#x27; in name) 
 Which I thought/expected to be flattened into Archives.2022 like in my personal setup.
 This is the relevan mbsynrc snippet: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; IMAPStore outlook-remote Account xxxxxx PathDelimiter &quot;.&quot;
 MaildirStore outlook-local Path ~/Mail/outlook/ #trailing / is important ! Inbox ~/Mail/outlook/INBOX
 Flatten &quot;.&quot;
 Subfolders Verbatim
 InfoDelimiter &quot;_&quot;
 Channel outlook Far :outlook-remote: Near :outlook-local: Patterns * INBOX* Create Near Expunge Near SyncState * Sync All &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Does anybody have some tips or tricks up their sleeve perhaps ?
 thx S

                              <span>I previously used Ubuntu and loved the Tlwg Typewriter Bold font on it. I had it as my code and general font for emacs since it was appealing for both purposes. Unfortunately MacOs - which I switched to recently - does not support this font. 
 I currently use Monospace Bold and am quite happy with it. But I looked at a font recently on another post here , and liked that as well (image below). Can someone tell me which font that is? And also, if you have any suggestions based on my taste above, please recommend me fonts to try out (if possible with the lisp code on your init.el so that its easy for me).
 P.S. I also like the red code font used on reddit here

                              <span>Tiki Tech is an open source Haskell simulation of (association) football.
 It begins from first principles, i.e. the motion of the players and the ball rather than from some existing statistical analysis of football. The idea is instead to work backwards from those statistical models and tweak the physical parameters until something approximating the real game of football emerges. I hope that this approach sets the simulation up for success as the application of data and analysis to football evolves and better statistical measures of success become increasingly available.
 Motivation
 There are clearly a number of existing football simulation games that are wildly more advanced and capable than this simple hobby project. The closed source and commercial nature of these alternatives makes f…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working in Python on a script that presents a history of zettelkasting in a table. It shows notes created each month—a fascinating look at how time has impacted zettelkasting. I&#x27;m into quantitative analysis, and this was fun learning a few tricks in Python.
If your Zk is file-based, uses a UID as part of the file name, like 202306XXX..., and you have Python and dependencies installed; it should work for you.
You can clone the repo and contribute if you want.

 New in this issue:
 - support for boundary/break API, which was introduced in Scala-3.3.0
 - changed API for custom monad contexts -- now monad context should provide an instance of monad with possible intercepted operations instead await interceptor. This is needed for unification with context-encoded direct style, where we can have no await-s. [And last relative significant change, for which we had kept the &#x27;0.x&#x27; versioning scheme].

                              <span>I have a solid understanding of how Behaviors works, the actor hierarchy and so on. 
 As part of my Master thesis, I would like study some of Akka&#x27;s internals, i.e. the code machinery that allow actors and Behaviors to work.
 I am aware of the Actor Architecture&#x27;s documentation, but I am looking for something different:
  
What are the most important components that allow an actor to come into existence and communicate with others? How do these components interact?
 When an actor does a tell, what components does the message go through until the receiving side processes it?
  
I examined the source code a bit; my understanding is that the ActorCell class is crucial; however, being an implementation component that is not to be touched by users directly, it is not covered by the user documentation. Similar reasoning for the ActorRefProvider class.
 Up until now I have found this resource (it provides a very useful component diagram); I am looking for similar resources, and possibly more comprehensive ones.
 Any resource would be helpful (even conference talks). Thanks for your inputs.

                              <span>I want the content of my src blocks to align with the #+ of the begin/end lines of the block. If I am under a list item, this does not happen. What I want is...
 - List item #+begin_src emacs-lisp (message &quot;correct&quot;) #+end_src 
 But what I get instead is...
 - List item #+begin_src emacs-lisp (message &quot;incorrect&quot;) #+end_src 
 I have org-src-preserve-indentation set to t because to get the proper alignment of my code when writing it, but I figure that it also causes the misalignment of the src contents w/ respect to the begin/end delimiters. Does anyone know of an easy fix for this issue? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit. More background information here. The recent &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session with the CEO of Reddit didn&#x27;t really address the concerns of people, and some subreddits decided that they would shutdown indefinitely.
 I think /r/haskell as a community should be discussing what action to take. On a personal level, this subreddit is pretty dear to me, as it has been my go-to place to keep up to date with the Haskell news over the years, and has been an invaluable source of information when I first started learning the language. So I guess my (kind of open-ended) question is: what is the stance of /r/haskell regarding the events happening on the broader Reddit? I am aware that a bunch of communities are migrating to some federated, open-source alternatives, most popular being Lemmy. Would us as a community consider such a mass exodus? The admin of functional.cafe, a Mastodon instance for the FP community, has recently been gauging interest in spinning up a Lemmy instance, maybe some arrangement could be made through cooperative effort?
 I have created this thread to hopefully seed some useful discussion surrounding these. I am looking forward to hear what the community thinks in general.

                              <span>I messed with my Emacs config recently and uninstalled some Clojure-related packages (clojure-mode, clojure-mode-extra-font-locking, cider) from a couple of years ago. I decided I wanted to explore Clojure again but now, when I run cider-jack-in, if I type an expression and hit Enter, it just creates newlines repeatedly, but does not evaluate.
 I have tried some troubleshooting steps, but have not had any success. What I&#x27;ve tried so far is:
  
Clear out ~/.emacs.d/elpa and let the packages install fresh.
 Upgrade leiningen (with brew on macOS), start a new Clojure project and core.clj file and try to jack in to that. (Has the same behavior.)
 Enabled logging for nrepl-server. No errors are logged.
  
Interestingly, if I run C-x C-e next to an expression in core.clj, it evaluates normally, but the REPL no longer works.
 Could you please suggest more troubleshooting steps or a possible fix? I am running EmacsforOSX version 28.2. I searched the web but have not yet found someone who encountered this same problem.
 EDIT: formatting.

                              <span>Hi folks, 
 I found the following in Section 16.10 of the Emacs Lisp Info Manual for Emacs 28.2: 
 &quot;Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use with-eval-after-load. If you need to examine and set the variables defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do it immediately—there is no need to wait until the library is loaded.&quot;
 Some obvious exceptions to setting variables &quot;immediately&quot; spring to mind, such as modifying a library&#x27;s keymaps with define-key(). The keymaps must already exist, of course, which happens only after the library is loaded. I don&#x27;t doubt that the manual authors had situations like that in mind with their beginning caveat, &quot;Normally . . .&quot; 
 But more generally: what if the library, upon loading, overwrites -- with its own default values -- the values the user had earlier set? 
 It seems to me that it&#x27;s safer to put all setq()s and whatnot into with-eval-after-load and be done with it. Or are there benefits to the blunter &quot;don&#x27;t bother waiting&quot; approach that I&#x27;m missing? 
 This comment from the Info Manual is tormenting me: I would sooner die than write an ill-designed Lisp program!

Pro: Word/symbol boundaries work as expected
 Con: Not incremental. Can&#x27;t keep typing and have the occur buffer dynamically update.
 Con: Doesn&#x27;t select the candidate corresponding to the current line at the time it was invoked. Leaves the point at the top.

                              <span>Has anyone managed to get the android port working with distros like Doom? I&#x27;m currently using termux, which is very close to perfect as it is, except that it doesn&#x27;t do graphical stuff like embedded images in org files.
 Documentation on the native android port is hard to find; searching tends to give me decades old stack overflow questions and lots of info about termux.
 Are there good docs about configuring the Android port?
 Maybe the ideal at this point would be just to be able to point the native port to the .emacs.d I have already set up in termux, if there&#x27;s a way to do that?
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using Debian-stable, known for its reliability. However, packages in the Debian repository tend to become outdated over time. Therefore, I chose to download the Emacs source tarball and compile it myself, which was successful. Recently, I came across the Guix package manager, which can be installed on Debian. Based on my research, guix install emacs installs Emacs in its own environment without requiring sudo access. This approach seems to reduce the likelihood of future dependency issues and makes package management easier. Is my understanding correct?
 I also observed that GUIX installed a daemon of some sort. I&#x27;m curious if this daemon consumes a significant amount of memory, considering it runs in the background continuously.
 Is it possible to install Emacs using GUIX while allowing the management of other packages to be handled by &quot;use-package&quot; as in my old configuration?

 (I know 10am is very late lol but it&#x27;s summer holidays so...)
 As you can see, all habits are grouped together at the bottom (even though morning habits start at 10am). I want it to show morning habits at the top at the correct position. How can I do that?

                              <span>In my setup I use a file for each &quot;project&quot; i.e.
  
Tasks - personal tasks
 Work - for work tasks
 Config - for tasks related to updating my config
 Game Design - tabletop game design tasks
 Programming Study - for learning / growing my programming knowledge
  
You get the idea. Each of these have a filetag so that everything is tagged and I have use categories for top level task types i.e. tasks/meetings/reminders etc (this lets me use category icons)
 The issue I have is for negative filtering. Say I want to filter out JUST my work and config tasks for say the weekend when I can work on a variety of personal projects.
 The documentation (here) states:
 C-u / Hide entries matching a tag. You can successively call this command to hide several tags. 
 If I call this and use Work it filters out work options. I call it again and the prompt is pre-filled with the text &quot;-work&quot; if i change it to &quot;config&quot; then work comes back. So I though maybe it should be &quot;-work-config&quot; when i do this it removes config but brings back work. I&#x27;m at a complete loss on how to apply multiple negative filters.
 I&#x27;ve also tried using \ for the Tag filter only mode not the more universal / filter. There same thing if I exclude work and run \ again and exclude config it brings work back

                              <span>Helm is useful in most cases, but it is sometimes very annoying because it doesn&#x27;t let me put what I want, maybe because it&#x27;s not in the list. Sometimes helm lets me do that by choosing question mark [?], but that&#x27;s not always the case.
 One example I experienced today. I&#x27;m using spacemacs with helm. I did find-file to a remote directory with TRAMP. So I&#x27;m in dired. From there I put M-x shell and it asked me the remote shell path. The default shown in helm text area is &quot;/bin/sh&quot; which is a reasonable default. But helm does not let me press enter there. So I can&#x27;t open a remote shell.
 I thought there would be a way to just force put &quot;/bin/sh&quot;, but I couldn&#x27;t find any ways. C-f, C-z or whatever didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m pretty surprised that helm does not have any unified way to fallback if there are no ways for a mature feature that existed such a long time.
 BTW, for that specific issue, I solved it with this elisp code, but I&#x27;m still curious if there&#x27;s a way to fallback on helm.

                              <span>Is there anyone using Quarto with Emacs here? If so, what is your setup and workflow?
 There is a quarto-mode, unfortunately it is not being actively developed (and my elisp skills are not good enough to submit meaningful PRs).
 Personally, I was unable to get quarto-mode to work for me as-is. The quarto-preview command does not work for me as it does not pick up the correct virtualenv, not even with pyvenv. Hence, I started to code up my own custom quarto-preview function, and continued to further write up some really basic elisp functions to make it work for me.
 My setup is summarised here: https://gist.github.com/fast-90/3d7ce3252fff59b0f6d6d1bcadcf4938
 Basically my workflow is (I only use it with Python):

                              <span>Org Mode is awesome for GTD task management and for note taking. However, for calendar (keep track of birthdays, holidays, this kind of stuff) or contacts i prefer to use CalDAV and CardDAV since I can use NextCloud for this and also it can well integrate with my smartphone.
 ​
 However, Akonadi (the PIM suite from KDE) is pretty unreliable. I&#x27;d like to interact with CalDAV and CardDAV from desktop nicely, but it really hangs more often than not. Is there a way to achieve this with Emacs?

                              <span>Does anyone know why org-download might be adding image links with different urls (download:)? When adding this to config.el (doom emacs):
 (after! org-download (setq org-download-method &#x27;directory) (setq org-download-image-dir (concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) &quot;-img&quot;)) (setq org-download-image-org-width 600)) 
 links appear as download: instead of file:. Then they don&#x27;t display correctly unless you manually change that url to file:.
 I assume that it must be detecting the file type and at some point decide to use a specific type of url (there is file: in source code, so it should be possible).
 It seems that by default org-downlaod just uses the standard org-mode&#x27;s attachment mechanism. The question though is why doesn&#x27;t changing org-download-method to directory switches it to a &quot;download&quot; url type.

 This face is defined in a file named nano-theme-support.el coming with nano-theme .
 I have loaded this filem but I still get the error, any idea?

 Closets I came to that is with

                              <span>If anyone is interested, I&#x27;ve created an Atom backend for Gnus, which can be found here.
 I posted it to the Emacs development mailing list, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s much interest in it currently.
 The only major remaining issue with it is that it doesn&#x27;t use Gnus&#x27; inheritance system, since I keep running into weird issues trying to implement it. If anyone is interested in helping with this I can provide more details. This doesn&#x27;t affect usage at all, but it kinda sucks because I designed the backend to be very modular so it would be simple to quickly build custom backends.
 To use it, add (or browse) Atom feeds as servers, with the address being the URL of the feed (without a &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;https://&quot; prefix due to a limitation with how Gnus parses group names in some cases unfortunately). For example:
 (add-to-list &#x27;gnus-secondary-select-methods &#x27;( nnatom &quot;somewebsite.tld/feed.xml&quot; (nnatom-name &quot;&quot;))) 
 Each &quot;server&quot; will contain a single group with a name taken from the feed or &#x27;nnatom-name&#x27;.
 Some design notes:
  
Atom feed entries (articles) can contain both a summary and &quot;content&quot; (or both, or neither). nnatom saves both, and allows viewing either by making the article multipart when needed.
 Every piece of data extracted from the feed is handled by a separate function, and all Gnus backend interface functions are generic, which allows very simple creation of derivative backends theoretically (you only need to implement a set of parsing functions for your feed).
 Every feed has it&#x27;s own file for data storage, and those are the only files modified directly by nnatom.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m working on a snippet where I want to have a filled comment like so:
 some code; /******************************************************************/ 
 this comment style respects fill-column, meaning it doesn&#x27;t go past it. so my thought is to go about it like this:
 $1; ${1:$(il/yas-comment-fill-separator)} 
 This function of mine works fine, but i need to know the length between the start of backquote expression and the fill-column. using only yas-text or yas-field-value isn&#x27;t very smart, as it doesn&#x27;t account for the other text not in the field. so, how do i obtain the start position/column of the backquote expression?

I&#x27;ve been trying to get into the habit of refactoring notes by spending a few minutes each day in the refactoring mode. Adding this routine to my &#x27;monk morning&#x27; has helped keep it consistent.
I&#x27;m reading:

I&#x27;m working on ideas for new statistical summaries of my ZK.
Summer is here in the northern hemisphere: mowing, weeding, long walks, farmers market, lots of tick checks.

 Does anyone know how to fix this issue and get sbt running successfully?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m building out my capture templates and I&#x27;m mostly squared away (borrowing a bit from Norang actually).
 One of the capture templates I use is for &quot;reminders&quot; these are tasks that I want to show up as a reminder on the agenda but are not TODO entries. A common use for me on these is for meetings. I drop the meeting on my calendar but capture it with a &quot;meeting&quot; capture template that clocks the meeting and I just notate my meeting notes within. 
 To accomplish this I have a top level heading called Reminders and under that I store them:
 If its a one off I use the  type of active timestamp so it shows on the agenda.
 If it is a recurring I use the following which I found online. the 3 means to show every 3rd day of the week. (1 2 3 4 5) would show mon-fri etc. 
 ** Weekly Marketing Meeting 11:00-12:00 :Reminder:  
 My one off reminder capture template uses %^T to prompt for and insert an active date+time which works perfectly. 
 I try to include this snippet of text in my capture template where I can just manually update the days I want the reminder to trigger for recurring ones like so
 (&quot;!&quot; &quot;recurring reminder&quot; entry (file &quot;~/Orgfiles/refile.org&quot;) &quot;* %? :REMINDER:\n %U\n  
 \n%a\n%i&quot; :empty-lines 1)
 However when I run the capture I get this output
   
 Ideally I&#x27;d love to use a prompt for &quot;which days to repeat&quot; where I could input 1 3 5 and get a m/w/f repeater output into the entry. 
 I&#x27;m still learning so this might be really simple elisp issue creating the erorr and void variable situation here.

                              <span>Hi there! Long-time org-moder here, but I&#x27;ve never gone beyond the basics of keeping notes and deadlines, maybe attaching the odd file.
 I&#x27;m experimenting with capture templates, in particular to get a diary going for appointments. Here is what I have:
  
&#x27;(org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;Diary&quot; entry (file+olp+datetree &quot;~/org-mode/diary.org&quot;) &quot;* %T %?&quot; :time-prompt t)))
  
Just a couple of small questions:
  
What does the &#x27;*&#x27; mean in the template? I see it in all of them but it&#x27;s quite a hard thing to search for!
 I quite often get the message &#x27;clipboard pasted as level 4 subtree&#x27; when I use this... but I don&#x27;t want that (and I&#x27;m not entirely sure what it means, since it doesn&#x27;t seem to paste my mac clipboard? maybe the emacs kill ring?)
 How can I do a newline so the timestamp appears below?
  
Simple questions I&#x27;m sure, but the notation is a bit overwhelming at first!
 Cheers

                              <span>I thought I had got this to work. I was wrong. I am now very confused.
 I want the following characters to pair automatically in org mode: &quot;/&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&#x3D;&quot; &quot;+&quot; &quot;_&quot; &quot;~&quot; &quot;&#x60;&quot; (the last to pair with &quot;&#x27;&quot;, for LaTeX). I also want them to *not pair when point is next to a word. I thought I had everything I wanted with this:
 (defun my/text-electric-pair-inhibit (char) ;; Account for buffer-end weirdness (unless (eq (following-char) 0) (or ;; (electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance char) ;; TODO This logic isn&#x27;t quite right, check out how ;; &#x60;electric-pair-inhibit-if-helps-balance&#x27; does it. ;; (electric-pair-conservative-inhibit char) ;; Don&#x27;t pair after before a word (memq (char-syntax (char-before)) &#x27;(?w ?.)) (memq (char-syntax (following-char)) &#x27;(?w ?.)) (memq (char-syntax (char-after (- (point) 2))) &#x27;(?w ?.))))) (setq electric-pair-inhibit-predicate #&#x27;my/text-electric-pair-inhibit) (modify-syntax-entry ?/ &quot;\&quot;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?* &quot;\&quot;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?&#x3D; &quot;\&quot;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?+ &quot;\&quot;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?_ &quot;\&quot;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?~ &quot;\&quot;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?&#x60; &quot;(&#x27;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) (modify-syntax-entry ?&#x27; &quot;)&#x60;&quot; org-mode-syntax-table) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t work. I get a few different bugs. Most of the time, the pairing works but the inhibition doesn&#x27;t (characters still pair immediately before or after a word character). Sometimes different characters with the same syntax class behave differently (e.g. &quot;&#x3D;&quot; and &quot;/&quot;, one will be inhibited and the other not). 
 I&#x27;m really confused. Any help appreciated.
 TIA.

                              <span>What is everyone&#x27;s preferred workflow for contributing changes to the packages you use?
 For example let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m using magit from melpa but I found a bug. I&#x27;d like to iterate on a fix and then submit a patch upstream. Since melpa downloads a tarball I&#x27;ve been using quilt which is workable but something git managed would be a lot more convenient.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up org-agenda to give me a one-screen view of the information I need. I can get all the info I want (10 day view, then unscheduled and expired/older TODOs) in a custom command, but it makes a long buffer and I need to scroll to get to the unscheduled stuff while leaving the right-hand side of the screen mostly empty.
 I&#x27;d like to have the standard ten days agenda list on the left, and a column shows me my unscheduled and expired TODOs on the right. I&#x27;ve tried opening the two in separate vertical split windows, but when I change agendas in one window, the other changes too.
 Is there a way to have different agenda views active at the same time? Or to have a single agenda view that flows through vertical columns somehow? Ideally I&#x27;d like to open the whole thing with a single command.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I read other posts about it but I didn&#x27;t found any working solution to improve the lag when LSP is active on a typescript project. I tried with PHP and intelephense and it is way faster, there is no input lag.
 I tried everything and every kind of suggestion present in corfu, orderless or eglot github/wikis. I don&#x27;t know how to debug it.
 This is a video showing the lag. Sometime the cursor disappears, it just so lagging that typing become frustrating. Video
 This is the output of the profiler profiler
 This is my config config
 Any idea or help is very welcome. Thank you.
 EDIT: BTW I even tried eglot+company without orderless, still the same lag. Even though a little bit less, but still frustratingly present.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using vterm + zsh + zsh-autosuggestions for most of my terminal stuff.
 This gives the latest completing history candidate in shadowed text at all times, and that candidate can then be selected with the right arrow key.
 This is superior to something like consult-history, as I don&#x27;t need to invoke it separately.
 Is there something equivalent for eshell, or can I set up eshell completion to be similarly frictionless? 
 Edit: nvm, just found esh-autosuggest, which should be the equivalent

                              <span>So, I just saw this post that talks about reading a book in the info format, which emacs supports natively.
 I generally do my reading with epub files on my phone. This has been a pain point for me with emacs, since while it can display epub files with docview (in emacs 29+) it&#x27;s just images. You can&#x27;t click on links and it doesn&#x27;t save your position or anything. Then there&#x27;s nov for ebook reading specifically, but I wanted to explore this other option, since info-mode is a core part of emacs and is likely to be better integrated with it. Plus, nov isn&#x27;t in active development.
 So, is there a converter from epub to info specifically for emacs? I tred a few online ones, but when trying to open it emacs complains with No such node or anchor: Top.
 Ideas?

                              <span>Someone help me out here. I&#x27;m following FP in Scala, the red book and I am currently at chapter 4, where we define our own &#x60;Option&#x60; type. This type, like other collections, takes a covariant type parameter &#x60;A&#x60;:
 enum Option[+A]: case Some(value: A) case Nothing 
 The book then asks to implement some methods for this type, including:
 def getOrElse[B &gt;: A](default: &#x3D;&gt; B): B &#x3D; this match case Some(value) &#x3D;&gt; value case Nothing &#x3D;&gt; default 
 This is where the confusion starts. Notice the type parameter annotation &#x60;B &gt;: A&#x60;. As far as I can tell, this means &#x60;B&#x60; is a supertype of &#x60;A&#x60;. I read this as a constraint. I can only pass values of types which are supertypes of &#x60;A&#x60; to this method. However, the following compiles without any issue:
 class Item { def show: String &#x3D; &quot;I am Item&quot;} class Buyable …</span>

Those were some really nice suggestions and books that I read and admire myself. I have put a list of books that helped and helping me now a lot in my engineering practice, I hope you can find it useful for yourself too and I would appreciate your feedback on those.

                              <span>Mill 0.11.0 is a breaking release with a focus on polish. This release fixes many long-standing sharp edges that could not be fixed without breaking backwards compatibility, and cleans up the Mill codebase for better maintainability and so we can offer better compatibility guarantees going forward. User-facing improvements include an overhauled documentation-site, much easier cross builds, faster/more-robust bootstrapping, better error messages. It aims to do everything Mill already does, but better.

                              <span>Hey!
 I want to hack together a simple api for a todo list (just delete update create read todos).
 I have no clue about the library ecosystem and thought about using:
  
warp for the http server (found a small snippet here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22620294/minimal-warp-webserver-example#22620295)
 for the database I would use postgresql, I found a library here https://github.com/nikita-volkov/hasql
  
Are there &quot;fine&quot;? Which libraries would you suggest using? Am I missing a big one I should consider?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been coding in Haskell for over 6 years and I still feel as if the lack of dot completion (i.e. completion after typing identifier. in the code editor) is the single thing I miss most compared to mainstream languages. In Haskell I find myself constantly jumping to type definitions, searching for documentation, or even grepping the project to recall the name of a function, when in (say) Rust or Typescript I could type foo. and have the editor show me what I need 90% of the time.
 Edit: Here&#x27;s a concrete example. I was working on some code with a variable vec :: Vector Int and needed to split it into two vectors based on some predicate. I recall that there is a function for doing exactly this, but can&#x27;t remember the name. In Haskell this is a situation where I usually find myself Googling for the Data.Vector documentation on Hackage. In other languages I would just type vec. and scan through the completion options to find what I need. This sort of thing happens many times per day and I feel like it makes a big difference in productivity.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking for a while, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find &quot;good&quot; resources on utilizing laziness effectively in practical Haskell.
 ​
 There&#x27;s Hutton&#x27;s explanation in Programming in Haskell, Bird actually seems to go quickly into laziness (chapters 1,2 of Thinking Functionally With Haskell), but I haven&#x27;t seen anything like, say, a Serokell article on how to manage laziness in practical terms.
 ​
 Maybe I&#x27;m just not trying hard enough? What I&#x27;m looking for is:
 --Laziness beyond the lazy infinite list (that&#x27;s just an iterator / generator function with better syntax).
 --How to effectively exploit laziness to improve algorithmic efficiency.
 --How to avoid space leaks mostly reliably.
 --When space leaks occur, best practices in locating and debugging them.
 ​
 I do have Okasaki (Purely Functional Data Structures) and Bird (Algorithm Design with Haskell), but I haven&#x27;t seriously gone through them. Are those books sufficient to master laziness / non-strictness to go from &quot;laziness is a 60-40 double-edged sword&quot; to &quot;laziness works for me 90+% of the time&quot;?
 ​
 
 ​
 It matters because, well, you have firms that deliberately choose a strict dialect of Haskell (SC, Mu), you have firms that go to -XStrict by default (NRI, Key.me), and, well, Purescript is strict, Idris is strict; Haskell is rare in making non-strict / lazy evaluation its default, and as functional programming becomes increasingly mainstream, Haskell&#x27;s main long-term selling point will be its experiment with lazy-by-default.
 ​
 However, lazy-by-default is best known for the resulting space leaks, not for its expressiveness advantages. For I myself, I&#x27;d like to have a list of resources to understand how to get pervasive laziness not to screw me, but rather be a useful tool, and I think it&#x27;d be useful to be able to redirect skeptics and newbies to a laziness resource list.

                              <span>I find fontification and coloring in emacs to be particularly opaque and difficult to grok.
 For quite some time now I&#x27;ve been happy with the nord theme, but I&#x27;m running into an issue where certain text in ESS is basically unreadable. 
 Here&#x27;s a screenshot depicting my trouble: https://imgur.com/a/yuNePvZ
 Note in particular the right hand buffer where the output from R is showing me the results of loading the tidyverse package (the bold, kinda royal blue text) and also the output of the dataframe&#x27;s contents (the dark text that&#x27;s almost unreadable).
 If I put point over the gray text and invoke M-x describe-char I get:
 There is an overlay here: From 1682 to 1697 evaporate t face (:foreground &quot;gray30&quot;) insert-behind-hooks (ansi-color-freeze-overlay) modification-hooks (ansi-color-freeze-overlay) 
 I can click the (:foreground &quot;gray30&quot;) bit which brings me to a Help buffer with the following contents:
 Face: :foreground undefined face. 
 That&#x27;s basically where I hit a dead-end because it&#x27;s not clear to me how to proceed beyond just blindly grepping through code in ESS and nord-theme. So I guess my questions are:
  
how do I figure out what &quot;gray30&quot; is and where it comes from
 why it&#x27;s undefined
 how do I change that to be something more readable?
  
edit: In case anyone else stumbles across this from Google, I believe I am experiencing the issue described here

                              <span>Haven’t seen anyone mention this but it seems like the best way to rebind the keys. You can stay on the home row and use your thumbs for ctrl and meta. Then maybe rebind caps lock as escape.

                              <span>So I am not looking for specific advice, but I&#x27;d like to know if anyone has this issue and their various fixes. A bit of context: I am on 29.0.91, Mac OSX, I use lsp(pylsp)+lsp-ui+company+flycheck+treesitter. Occasionally, pylsp fails in some way, via a timeout or an actual bug. This is fine, but I sometimes can&#x27;t keep going because my syntax highlighting stops updating. I understand that LSP servers will sometimes have bugs and fail - it is a hard problem, but I&#x27;d like to make emacs robust to this: how can I make it so other aspects of my emacs setup, especially syntax highlighting and basic emacs functionality, are robust to failures in LSP mode?

                              <span>I have installed Jedi - the python autocomplete package - on my emacs. The autocomplete feature is great, but causes me issues when I am navigating through the code. 
 A simple example is: when I comment a line in my code, and try to move to the line above or below, I can&#x27;t do it. This is because the auto-complete pops up, and it scrolls through those options rather than go up or down in my code. As a result, every time I need to comment -&gt; move left -&gt; move up, instead of just moving up. Commenting is just one example. There are several other times (changing variables and so on) where this happens.
 I want the autocomplete to help me when I am trying to finish a variable or call a function, not unnecessarily bother me like this. Do you guys know of any solution to fix this? Maybe changing the keys for scrolling through autocomplete might help (although that might make it difficult to use it in normal circumstances, I am open to ideas). Any suggestions are welcome.

 I am a CS undergrad and currently taking a functional programming class. The teacher has left us about 8 weeks to make a final project, without any directions. If you were to make some project in haskell, that would take about 6 weeks, what would you do?

                              <span>Hi, I’m learning haskell for the 2nd time and this time it’s really cliking and I love it.
 The problem is I need to find a project where I can use it. 
 I’m an embedded engineer, I mostly do linux stuff and sometimes bare metal, I mainly use cpp. My dev set up is mainly comprised of neovim and terminal app. 
 Ideally I would love to create a tool that I would use often and keep expanding so that I keep practicing haskell. 
 Any idea? :)

                              <span>I use org-refile to navigate and file things all the time. While it is functional, I have long craved something a little more flexible.
 So I&#x27;ve written a package that allows you to programmatically set composable shortcuts for org-refile.
 https://github.com/thread314/org-navigator
 It allows the user to set prefix shortcut keys to various actions (refile to, go-to, clock in to etc), and combine these with suffix keys that define the target for the desired action.
 So for example, typing C-c fa might file the current subtree to the subtree set to &quot;a&quot;, whereas C-c ia would instead jump to that subtree and open it in an indirect buffer.
 It also allows the user to define the destination suffix keys by setting a property on the target subtree itself from within the org-mode file.
 I&#x27;m not a programmer so always very open to any feedback or suggestions.

                              <span>I use conda to activate my python virtual envs in emacs (in shells and python buffers). To enable it, I use this code (I use straight.el with use-package):  (use-package conda :config ;; for interactive shell support (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells) ;; for eshell support (conda-env-initialize-eshell) ;; auto-activation (conda-env-autoactivate-mode t) ;; automatically activate a conda environment on the opening of a file (add-hook &#x27;find-file-hook (lambda () (when (bound-and-true-p conda-project-env-path) (conda-env-activate-for-buffer)))) )  This takes 0.7 sec according to ESUP (startup profiler). It clearly doesn&#x27;t need to do anything until I start a shell or load a python buffer, so what&#x27;s the best way to defer its loading until it&#x27;s needed?

                              <span>Hey
 I&#x27;m starting with reproducible research in MySQL using org-babel.
 https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-sql.html
 I am able to connect to the remote host (manual SSH tunnel), but the configuration of dbhost/dbuser and so on needs to be applied to each block. Is it possible to have some macro that would expand during execution? Let&#x27;s say my init.el has predefined values for each of the databases I use. In the org doc, I would be able to reference (like #+use_headers: this_db). I know I can have macros that would type all those headers, but having this data present in each file makes it less readable and adds some chance of data leakage.

 I&#x27;m not sure what changed but I cannot use org-capture (or org-roam-capture) anymore I&#x27;m getting the following error : 
  
json-read: Invalid number format:5
  
And I don&#x27;t get any answers If I plug that into a search engine. 
 I&#x27;ve updated my linux install yesterday if that&#x27;s relevant.

 Gnus seems to fit his but looks hard to configure and also seems to be more suited for just reading than also for composing emails. Before trying it out I&#x27;d like to know if there&#x27;s a better alternative around. Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>Hi folks! Hope I&#x27;m posting in the right place. I need a bit of help with fonts... I bought the awesome font set Pragmata Pro, but only the Liga and Mono (I may eventually buy the italic and bold variants, but they are expensive for my budget)
 I managed to set them up in Emacs, but I wonder if Emacs can stretch the font, or make it lighter?
 I&#x27;m using this to define the fonts in init.el, but the width and weight are completely ignored:
  (setq my-font &quot;PragmataPro Mono Liga-12&quot;) (set-face-attribute &#x27;fixed-pitch nil :family my-font :width &#x27;extra-expanded :weight &#x27;light) (setq my-font &quot;PragmataPro Liga-12&quot;) (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :family my-font :width &#x27;extra-expanded :weight &#x27;light) (set-face-attribute &#x27;variable-pitch nil :family my-font :width &#x27;extra-expanded :weight &#x27;light) (set-frame-font my-font nil t) 
 Thank you for your time!

                              <span>I am trying to run quarto preview file.qmd using shell-command, however I get an error my Jupyter kernel is not found. (For those unfamiliar with quarto or Jupyter, this probably means that it is not correctly recognizing my virtualenv). 
 However, if I run the same command using M-x shell and then typing it out manually, it works as expected. It also works in vterm as well as my terminal outside of Emacs.
 I have tried to check relevant (environment) variables between shell-command and shell, but I can&#x27;t notice any difference. For the avoidance of doubt I mainly checked the following: - echo $VIRTUAL_ENV - which jupyter - jupyter kernelspec list (both show that my kernel is available, even when using shell command
 Can anyone explain me where the difference could lie between the different results between shell-command and shell? Is there any way to execute a command as if it was executed using shell?

                              <span>VS Code appears to support the evaluation of code in comment blocks and inserting its output there. For example, evaluating this Haskell comment block in the buffer:
 -- &gt;&gt;&gt; map (+2) [1,5,7] 
 the comment block gets replaced with:
 -- &gt;&gt;&gt; map (+2) [1,5,7] -- [3,7,9] 
 Is this possible to replicate in Emacs?
 Or to phrase my question differently, in Lisp mode, Emacs has the key binding C-j (which executes eval-print-last-sexp) to evaluate Lisp code and insert its output in the buffer. Is there an equivalent mechanism for evaluating code in other major modes? Can this be achieved with lsp-mode or eglot maybe?

                              <span>A package manger allows users to install, remove, upgrade, configure and manage software packages on any GNU/Linux distro. Package mangers can come as either a GUI software center or a command line tool (apt, dnf, pacman) 
 I have noticed that in Emacs word &quot;manger&quot; has been replaced with &quot;archive&quot; is this because their is a difference between a package manger and a package archive? Is it called an archive in Emacs instead of a manger for a reason?
 I&#x27;m almost certain that they are they are the same thing just different names but wanted to make sure. 
 Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

 I use scrivener for larger project planning and overseeing, as I like the way to organize documents there; however I only want to hop into it once every couple of weeks.
 Daily, I use emacs, and I would love to be able to just work with one or 2 documents in org mode on the fly as needed.
 Anyone familiar with a way that this might be easily done?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Sharing a short note about upcoming Iron library updates. The next release enables the convenient turning of opaque types into value objects with optional validation and neat subtyping.
 So, we&#x27;ll be able to do things like: scala opaque type Temperature &#x3D; Double :| Positive object Temperature extends RefinedTypeOps[Temperature] 
 and after both value and apply are in place for iron&amp;opaque types: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; val t1 &#x3D; Temperature(100) val t2 &#x3D; Temperature(100)
 val result &#x3D; t1.value + t2.value &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The note itself: Iron updates: turning opaque types into value objects
 And there is a beginner-friendly ticket: Add alias for True constraint and IronType[A, True]
 Thank you!

                              <span>Anybody working on an online course for Scala 3 macros? I would totally pay for this. Have tried following the tutorials, but once they give an example or two and then say check out the API docs, it&#x27;s pretty overwhelming. Maybe we could crowd-fund something?
 Alternatively, does anybody offer hourly tutoring/consulting for macros? I&#x27;m using them for a side project, so don&#x27;t have any colleagues to bounce things off of.

                              <span>If visionOS is like macOS, it would be super interesting to see how emacs is going to be used in this technolgy. Maybe keyboard is the history? I mean, a user can define a gesture, putting middle finger out, as M-x, followed by a sequence of ninjutsu, like the Naruto things. Then a command will prompt out as you wish. And you can still fully use all the .emacs things in that case. 
 Are you looking forward this device? How are you going to adapt it into your daily use? What things cannot be done rightnow but super easy for using it on visionOS? Love to hear your voice.

                              <span>Hi, Im trying to get spellchecking to work in emacs. Below you can find my config: 
 (require &#x27;ispell) (setenv &quot;DICPATH&quot; &quot;/usr/share/hunspell&quot;) ;; (setq ispell-program-name &quot;hunspell&quot; ; Use hunspell to correct mistakes ispell-dictionary &quot;en_US&quot;) ; Default dictionary to use 
 Even though this seems to be working, ive noticed that the dictionary is incomplete. For example it does not recognize words like &quot;worked, explored, exploited, difficulties&quot; and a tone of others. The same behaviour I encounter when im using hunspell from terminal. 
 Am I doing something wrong or its hunspell?
 Im using hunspell 1.7.2 and emacs 28.2 in arch linux

                              <span>I am on WSL running Ubuntu 20.04, with Emacs built from source. My build configuration flags is as follows:
  &quot;--with-native-compilation -with-json --with-modules --with-harfbuzz --with-compress-install --with-threads --with-included-regex --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;gtk3 --with-zlib --with-jpeg --with-png --with-imagemagick --with-tiff --with-xpm --with-gnutls --with-xft --with-xml2 --with-mailutils --with-tree-sitter --with-xwidgets CC&#x3D;gcc-10&quot; 
 When I open a page (e.g. https://www.gnu.org/) with xwidget-webkit-browse-url all I ever see is a white screen.
 Has anyone been succesful getting xwidget working on a WSL setup? If so, I&#x27;d like to hear how you got it working!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use my init.el byte compiled. It works, but if it is further native compiled (automatically), it doesn&#x27;t. The problem is with packages which are loaded in a deferred way. Native compile doesn&#x27;t have a chance to know whether a particular call is a macro or a function. For example, if my init.el is this:
 (with-eval-after-load &quot;evil&quot; (evil-define-key &#x27;normal Info-mode-map (kbd &quot;m&quot;) &#x27;Info-menu)) 
 It works if init.el is just byte-compiled. But native compilation gives a warning:
 init.el:3:4: Warning: the function ‘evil-define-key’ is not known to be defined. 
 (Note with init.el is so small, it seems that native compilation doesn&#x27;t happen automatically, so you may have to run (native-compile &quot;~/.emacs.d/init.el&quot;) manually to reproduce this)
 And later I indeed have a problem when I restart emacs (it tries to call evil-define-key as a function, but it&#x27;s not found because it&#x27;s a macro)
 What could be the solution for this problem? Note, that I have almost everything loaded in a deferred way. One possible solution I see is that I load all the deferred packages somehow (is there an emacs/use-package function for this?), then call native-compile manually (instead of relying of the automatic native compilation) to make sure that native-compile sees all the macros.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Newbie to Org-mode here. I think this will be easy to answer to most of you. I see a problem with creating a new bullet list item:
 For example when I am beneath a header with a bunch of bullets and I hit M-RET , this by default should execute: 
 org-insert-item 
 What I get instead is that Emacs creates a new same-level heading beneath last bullet ( even cuts remaining text from above bullet text
 ** Heading 2
 - Item
 ** 1
 Support to create new bullet underneath Item 1 but I get only 1 with same heading level as above.
 Any ideas ? It worked and now all of the sudden it stopped.
 I have following packages installed for org mode: &quot;org&quot;, &quot;org-bullets&quot;
 ​
 Thank you

 I currently am reading a paper (to be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02856.pdf ) that includes some haskell code. The authors made some statements about various topics, some more some less related to functional programming that left me a little confused. I would be really grateful if someone could help me to better my understanding here. I will be marking the section concerned with quotes:

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a good setup working for typescript, using some basic lsp-mode and treesitter.
 I have vue-mode installed, but I am failing to have good syntax coloring of the script block.
 Does anybody have a good setup (pref. straight.el based) I can take a look at ?

                              <span>I recently started a new internship and have to use Windows (bleh). Surprisingly, porting my Emacs config over was painless. 
 A few days went by with no hiccups. Then seemingly out of nowhere, whenever I opened my Org files, all of my lines ended in dos carriage returns, ^M. Moreover, it opened a popup buffer that said there was an encoding conflict with the inputting encoding system and the underlying default. I didn&#x27;t document it and have been unable to reproduce it. 
 To get rid of it, I have to M-x revert-buffer-with-coding-system RET utf-8-dos every time I open an org-file. 
 Does anyone know of a more permanent solution? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 this problem is making me mad.I would like to be able to select \frac{any text}{any text}, I tried with evil-object but the documentation that i found is quite short. So I tried with emacs function:
 (defun select-latex-expression () &quot;Selects the entire LaTeX expression \\frac{any text}{any text}.&quot; (interactive) (search-backward &quot;\\frac{&quot; nil t) (backward-char) (set-mark (point)) (search-forward-regexp &quot;}[^\}]*&quot; nil t) (forward-char)) 
 This is what I came up with, but work only partially, and wrong sometimes.I could implement it?Thanks 
 EDIT: 
 (defun select-latex-frac () &quot;Visually selects the LaTeX fraction expression under point.&quot; (interactive) (save-excursion (re-search-backward &quot;\\\\frac{[^{}]*}{[^{}]*}&quot;) (setq start (match-beginning 0)) (setq end (match-end 0)) (evil-visual-make-selection start end))) 
 This work better but now I have some problem with expression like:
  \frac{\frac{prova}{prova}}{\sum^{}}

                              <span>Hi,
 I had written a package that allow using org-ql with org-roam:
 https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/org-roam-ql
 The idea was to make org-ql aware of the org-roam database. The package also allows viewing the content of an org-roam buffer in an org-ql-view buffer, which would allow querying based on the nodes, or vice versa, viewing the content of a org-ql-view in a org-roam-like buffer.
 Switching from an org-roam buffer to a org-ql buffer, narrowing the results using org-ql then rending the results in an org-roam-like buffer (which I am org-roam-ql buffers)
 Querty the org-roam database
 It&#x27;s my first package and I am still working on it. I would love to hear any feedback on it :)

Is there a way to tell it to ignore these findings within a buffer or before an expression?

 I know I can add :tangle $file on the tail of the begin_src line, and that I can specify #+property: header-args :tangle $file at the top of the file, but suppose I want to be lazy, and say that all blocks under top level headline “A” are to be tangled to file “A” and everything under headline “B” go into file “B”?
 Is this doable?

All I’m looking for is a number that I can appear in the final html document after using org-html-to-htm. Here is best code I could come up with. Is there an easier way than cranking up python just to do this.
 As expected, this prints This is the result: 1

                              <span>Is anyone using Org Mode just for notes, and not using it for maintaining a TODO list or an agenda?
 Are there advantages to doing this over using a Markdown-based note taking system such as Obsidian or Joplin?
 What iOS mobile options are there for this Org Mode mote taking? I&#x27;ve used BeOrg and it seems to be TODO list focused.

 How do org-mode/org-roam peeps integrate Slack with their systems and remain GTD productive? 
 The Longer Tale
 Perhaps more a general r/emacs question than org-mode but I&#x27;m very curious how people use org-mode and Slack together, particularly in terms of capturing TODOS and generally being productive and relating things back to source material. 
 In general, I find Slack turns my highly efficient, inbox-zero, mail-based, David-Allen-esque GTD system to swiss cheese by creating about 200 &quot;inboxes&quot;, so I&quot;m kinda wondering what other org-mode-ians do, and what the mu4e equivalent might be to Slack vs mail (to be clear, I use gmail&#x27;s web interface even for mail, but lean into org-mode to manage notes and TODOs). 
 Would love to hear what&#x27;s working for people vs not. (rather than us all griping about Slack... &#x3D;] I&#x27;m not a fan of the tool, but feel most of its problems are around the way people use it, rather than the tool itself — despite the discourse and twist folks trying to convince me to give those a go at my company. &#x3D;] ).

                              <span>&quot;The vital first step towards understanding a theory,&#x27; Popper (1972, p. 182) said, &quot;is to understand the problem situation in which it arises.&quot;1


In the spirit of this quote, I was thinking to myself, &quot;What is the problem situation that the ZKM was created for?&quot;
In the Introduction to the ZKM article @Sascha said that it, &quot;is a holistic method on how to deal with knowledge in your life.&quot; So, it would seem that it is, in part, helping with managing your knowledge outside of our memory system. I think elsewhere it is referred to as &quot;a personal tool for thinking and writing.&quot; Which, I think helps to see more of the picture of the problem situation. Knowledge. Thinking. Writing.
I&#x27;d love to hear some thoughts from others in this forum on how they&#x27;d answer this question.

I would love an option either in a right click menu or a keyboard shortcut to view the &quot;Get Info&quot;  (Mac) or Properties window. I would like to occasionally look up the creation date for my files. I don&#x27;t need this information often but I&#x27;d occasionally like to find the info. Going forward I&#x27;m adding this info in the text of my notes but I&#x27;ve imported years worth of notes from nvalt which I&#x27;d have to manually update with the creation date.
Thanks!</span>

There is a file in the Archive that I have renamed (perhaps while it was open in the Archive). I have just one copy of the file. as confirmed by ls. And yet I see it twice in the Archive.


Restarting the Archive did not fix this issue. I don&#x27;t believe I have messed with ln and such here, so no symbolic links business is involved. Finally, all this is under git, in case that is somehow implicated.
I am at Archive 1.7.7.

 I try to use the status200 from http-types in a stack project.
 but I can&#x27;t use it because it is a hidden package or something.
 I added the http-types to the package.yaml
 and I tried to add this package to the stack.yaml/extra-deps:
 with http-types-0.3.12
 but I can use it.
 the code and error are below.
 Could you help me what is the problem here please ?

                              <span>I wish to import an allEqual algorithm from APL, particularly (⌈/≡⌊/). This is, to my understanding, the same as a liftM2 (phi combinator) used on the dyadic equals along with two monadic functions max and min.
 Essentially I am wondering what max and min are in Haskell, so that i can do max [1,2,3] &#x3D;&gt; 3.
 I thought this was maximum and minimum in Haskell, after having looked around a little. But attempting to implement my solution doesn&#x27;t work:
 allEqual [Int] -&gt; Bool allEqual [] &#x3D; True allEqual xs &#x3D; liftM2 (&#x3D;&#x3D;) maximum minimum

                              <span>Hi All,
 base32-0.3 is out now, with extended support for GHCs 8.10 thru 9.6, as well as a text and bytestring min version bump. 
 This will be the last in the 0.x series for this library. base32, along withbase16 and base64, are nearing the release of a new epoch 1.x version cycle. In addition to various reworkings of the core apis for all of the base encoding libraries will come a focus on newtyped inputs and outputs, allowing for encode/decode, as well as support for SIMD-enabled loops for architectures that support it. 
 Cheers, Emily

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m playing around with my emacs config.Using use-package lazy loading options I settled down to ~0.4 s startup time with ~120 packages.Is possible to get even lower?
 At the moment evil and projectile are taking up 0.050 s, can I maybe shave down from projectile?
 I&#x27;m doing this just for fun, 0.4 s is already ultra fast enough, with emacsclient I get as low as 0.35 s ish
 This is my emacs config: https://github.com/Stefanomarton/DotFiles/tree/master/.config/emacs, maybe could be useful to someone.
 Thanks to anyone suggesting something 
 EDIT: maybe there is a specific order in which load stuff?

                              <span>I like Outshine, but it&#x27;s always been buggy, and after a system upgrade to Ubuntu 23.04 (with Emacs 28.2), it hasn&#x27;t really been working at all, even with the latest Outshine from MELPA. outshine-cycle-buffer prints the expected messages in the minibuffer, but has no apparent effect on the buffer contents. Looking at the GitHub issues, I think the package isn&#x27;t getting the TLC it needs.
 I&#x27;m not eager to try fixing Outshine myself, so what would you suggest as alternative approaches for code folding or navigating large files? I have low vision, so I use big fonts, so I don&#x27;t have many lines of code on screen at once, generally about 20.

 VSCode hilighting
 Any idea on how to fix this and get complete VSCode like hilighting? If you notice here &#x60;isLoading&#x60; and &#x60;setIsLoading&#x60; are also different because one is a variable and other is a function. I guess VScode knows this because of semantic hilighting from lsp? 
 I guess eglot doesn&#x27;t support it yet: https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/pull/839
 But I thought atleast typescript would be smart enough to highlight &#x60;setError&#x60; correctly to pink in the emacs case.

                              <span>I use default key bindings and meow, on Japanese keyboard with the help of key re-mapper called keyd for linux, and sharpkeys for windows. Here are the reasons.
 - Emacs default key bindings are the ones that are also used in other programs, like terminal. Getting used to text-operation stuff (like C-a/M-f) to some extent makes consistency.
 - I use Japanese keyboard on desktop and laptop so that I can remap , 
, and  key (they are on my thumbs position) to control, shift, and escape key. I want my keyboard layout to be the same on desktop and laptop, so thumb clusters keyboards are not my choice.
 - I use meow for modal editing. I&#x27;ve used evil, but I didn&#x27;t like to configure evil key bindings for every different mode. I also didn&#x27;t like to disable evil completely for some modes. I just wanted to use j/k and J/K (I map J/K to scroll up/down faster) in certain modes like magit, that do not require much text editing. The thing I like the most about meow is its motion mode. In motion mode, I can use j/k and J/K to scroll, and if I wanted to dispatch keys that are bound in major-mode maps, I can simply prefix them with SPC key (the default is Hyper key, I changed it). In magit for example, I can dispatch k (magit-discard) by pressing SPC-k. Any keys that are not in motion mode map follow the major mode map. I do not use meow keypad because I&#x27;m comfortable with pressing control key. But for those who are not, meow keypad might be good.
 ​
 What do you think? I see a key bindings discussion occasionally here so hope this helps.
 I would very appreciate your suggestion.

                              <span>I have a static website that I have just setup using org. I use org-export-dispatch to html and everything works fine. However when I export images they don&#x27;t work. I have uploaded some images to a publicly accessible folder, but when I embed a link using org-insert-link it just exports the image name? If anyone has any ideas?

                              <span>I was thinking of something similar to OS file managers, where you can right-click a file and have operations relevant to the extension pop up. For example, if I could hover over a file in Dired and have something like a org-capture template menu of categories/operations pop up according to the files extension. I was thinking of how useful this would be for being able to define commands for file compression or (extension-specific) conversion in a config.
 Alternatively if anyone knows of a method to could accomplish something similar to this would be appreciated, I&#x27;d just be interested in having a good way to run common commands on files from Emacs.

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 I&#x27;m relatively new to Emacs and I&#x27;m trying to figure out which text-inputting framework I should use. I&#x27;ve never used Vim before, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will. I have a keyboard with thumb clusters, which eliminates the issue of the &quot;Emacs pinky&quot; entirely. In fact, I find myself preferring chorded commands because they make me feel like a Jedi, with my keyboard as a lightsaber of sorts. It all started with cut/copy/paste when I was a child, and Emacs&#x27; style of running commands feels more like magical sorcery to me.
 Moreover, I use a different keyboard layout than the standard &quot;QWERTY,&quot; so the default movement keys in Vim (&quot;HJKL&quot;) are less convenient for me.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that switching between insert and normal mode in Evil Mode throws me off a bit, but maybe I just need to get used to it. I often hear people say that Evil Mode is a superior way to edit text compared to the default Emacs keybindings. However, I wonder if this preference is mostly driven by those who started with Vim and are already used to modal editing.
 I&#x27;m curious to hear your thoughts. In your opinion, what makes modal editing either superior/inferior? I&#x27;m particularly interested in hearing from those who have switched from Emacs to Vim (lol), especially if they inadvertently got used to Emacs keybindings first.
 Looking forward to your insights!

                              <span>Both corfu and cape READMEs suggests using advices to solve pcmpl-args issues when completing in eshell, I think one of these issues is variable completion like described on https://github.com/JonWaltman/pcmpl-args.el/issues/22#issue-1112526220 (or not? please correct me if i&#x27;m thinking wrong). But I don&#x27;t see any changes, the behavior is the same before and after loading the advices.
 My config is: elisp (use-package pcmpl-args :after eshell :demand nil :config (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-purify)) 
 Which expands to: elisp (eval-after-load &#x27;eshell &#x27;(progn (require &#x27;pcmpl-args nil nil) (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-silent) (advice-add &#x27;pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #&#x27;cape-wrap-purify) t))) 
 cape is loaded with emacs initalization so I think it&#x27;s irelevant, but here is anyway: elisp (use-package cape :defer 1 :config (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions &#x27;cape-file)) 
 (I tried to open this issue on both cape and corfu repos but github blocked me and I don&#x27;t know why)

                              <span>As part of their 12in23 challenge (trying out 12 programming languages in 2023) the exercism platform is currently highlighting the lisp family of languages — including Emacs Lisp.
 Announcement video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5Kg7gC1YcWs
 Emacs Lisp track: https://exercism.org/tracks/emacs-lisp
 I did not assess the quality of their material (although I heard good things about their Rust track) but, in all cases, I&#x27;m thinking it could be a good way for people not familiar with Emacs Lisp to start tweaking their editor. :-)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m using dirvish for browsing folders and appreciate the plain text preview feature. 
 It is working surprisingly well even for office documents with the help of some external libraries (pandoc, pdftotext, etc...) : https://i.imgur.com/ZET3dWt.png 
 and ability to register your own dirvish-preview-dispatchers. 
 Example with docx file : 
  ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for docx files (dirvish-define-preview docx (file ext) &quot;Preview docx files in plain text Require: &#x60;pandoc&#x27; (executable)&quot; :require (&quot;pandoc&quot; ) (cond ((equal ext &quot;docx&quot;) &#x60;(shell . (&quot;pandoc&quot; &quot;-t&quot; &quot;plain&quot;,file))))) (add-to-list &#x27;dirvish-preview-dispatchers &#x27;docx) 
 I&#x27;m however struggling with pptx extension as I need to chain execution of 2 commands : 
  
pptx2md for converting PPTX to markup files 
 pandoc for markup files to plain text. 
  
I&#x27;ve tried to use &quot; &amp;&amp; &quot; like this : 
 ;; register a plain text dirvish dispatcher for PPTX files (dirvish-define-preview pptx (file ext) &quot;Preview PPTX files in plain text Require: &#x60;pptx2md&#x27; &amp; &#x60;pandoc&#x27; (executables)&quot; :require (&quot;pptx2md&quot;) :require (&quot;pandoc&quot;) (cond ((equal ext &quot;pptx&quot;) &#x60;(shell . (&quot;pptx2md&quot;, &quot;--disable-image&quot;,file,&quot;&amp;&amp; pandoc&quot;,&quot;-f&quot;,&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;-&gt;t&quot;,&quot;plain&quot;,&quot;out.md&quot;)))) ) (add-to-list &#x27;dirvish-preview-dispatchers &#x27;pptx) 
 but end up with this output in my buffer : 
 usage: pptx2md [-h] [-t TITLE] [-o OUTPUT] [-i IMAGE_DIR] [--image-width IMAGE_WIDTH] [--disable-image] [--disable-wmf] [--disable-color] [--disable-escaping] [--wiki] [--mdk] [--min-block-size MIN_BLOCK_SIZE] pptx_path pptx2md: error: unrecognized arguments: &amp;&amp; pandoc -f markdown out.md 
 I understand why I have this issue, and think it will be possible to fix it by creating my own shell script mixing both commands, but would like to know what is proper way to handle this in elisp. 
 Any ideas ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working on an emacs configuration for myself. I&#x27;m coming from NeoVim and VSCode and both of those have a pretty easy way to fuzzy search for files in the current directory. VSCode has this built in and NeoVim can do this through telescope.
 It feels like there isn&#x27;t a &quot;simple&quot; solution to this in emacs. find-file more or less requires me to type the path. Yes you get tab completion, but that&#x27;s still pretty slow in comparison. And beyond that i seem to get into selectrum, orderless, marginalia and what not, which for one doesn&#x27;t seem to solve this problem either, and feels needlessly complex for what i&#x27;m trying to do.
 So, my workflow has always been that i open my editor in my main projects directory. When i want to open a file, i press a hotkey and start searching with file and folder names. In 99.99% of cases i know exactly how the file is named and where it&#x27;s located. I just don&#x27;t want to have to type out the path. I&#x27;d rather type the parts of the path that are unique and get there quickly.
 What&#x27;s the simplest solution for this? All i really need is a wrapper around fzf. fzf.el would do what i need, but doesn&#x27;t work on windows. There is a fork of fzf.el that &quot;should&quot; fix that but i can&#x27;t get it to work. I&#x27;m also not too sure how to point use-package to a random git repository rather than what&#x27;s on melpa.

                              <span>So i&#x27;ve tried going trough the haskell version of the LLVM kaleidoscope tutorial for haskell. But i quickly faced an issue which is that LLVM-hs fails to compile which is due to the fact that the project requires llvm-4.0 which is really outdated and i can&#x27;t really build it or install it trough my package manager i know that LLVM-hs supports LLVM-9.0 but that is also too old. So is there some workaround to this or should i just pick a different language for my compiler (Which would be sad since i really like haskell).

                              <span>I am working on a parser that converts text to tokens (tokenizer). I would like the type system to check that there is a parser, combined with Alternative, is provided for every token. Is there a way to easily do this?
 I have tried a type-list but it seems to be exponential in compile time and space with respect to the number of token constructors.

 Python version:
 with open(filename) as f: content &#x3D; f.readlines() for line in content: print(line) 
 Scala version:
 with_ (open(filename)): f &#x3D;&gt; val content &#x3D; f.readLines() content.foreach: println(_)

 def with_[A](expression: A)(suite: A &#x3D;&gt; Unit): Unit &#x3D; val manager &#x3D; expression val enter &#x3D; try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(&quot;__enter__&quot;) catch _ &#x3D;&gt; null val exit &#x3D; try manager.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(&quot;__exit__&quot;) catch _ &#x3D;&gt; null val value &#x3D; if enter !&#x3D; null then enter.invoke(manager).asInstanceOf[A] else manager try suite(value) catch case e: Exception &#x3D;&gt; println(e) finally if exit !&#x3D; null then exit.invoke(manager) 
 My implementation is obviously highly inspired by Python&#x27;s. For example, by defining a simple file I/O wrapper with __enter__ and __exit__ methods we can nicely and properly handle file reading and writting.
 Let me know what you think and if you have other ideas!

                              <span>I’ve heard about scala for some time now and it seems really interesting. I want to learn and I’m not really sure how to get started and which framework library to learn.
 For context I work as a web developer with node (with express), react and vue. 
 Most job postings I see usually mention http4s and specifically mention having experience with libraries other than Play is a plus. Would learning http4s would be a good idea, from what I understand it’s more fp and the only fp knowledge I have is from an university course in Clisp.
 I would appreciate any recommendations.

 What companies do you know with interesting Scala-based tech stack?
 I am mostly interested in e-commerce domain and preferably remote work in Europe, but I would be glad to know about any projects with exciting technologies.

No
 Yes
  
For many decades editors have been unable to do simple things. Like correctly color variables. That is until now. Emacs 29 treesit is here. It is going to enable so many new features.
  
paredit/lispy edits for all languages? check!
 highlight thing at point, in a scope sensitive way? check!
 sticky scroll? check!
 Syntax highlighting that actually works right? check!
  
4 decades of being unable to add color to variables has passed. Programmers have been born, lived, and retired all under that era. This is all about to change. These insurmountable problems are about to become EASY to solve. YOU can implement the features that were impossibly hard for the previous generation. YOU can implement an object-at-point highlighter that is more performant and correct than ever. All you need to know is how to walk a tree.
 Trees are really what enable lisp&#x27;s special powers. Lisp&#x27;s tree nature is what made it possible to easily make advanced modes like paredit. Now everyone is about to have their tree exposed to package developers, not just lisp. The other languages always had a tree, it was just hidden. Adding treesitter to Emacs is more than just another feature. It is lisp-esque. It will pave the way to true editing features.

 The remote host is running Ubuntu 20.04 and my local host is MacOS Ventura 13.3.1.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a complete Emacs newbie and recently decided to take the plunge on my macOS system. As a beginner, I find the learning curve a bit steep, especially when it comes to customizing my setup.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to set up Doom Emacs with a configuration from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/slano-ls/Doom-Emacs-Config and ran into some issues.
 Firstly, the installation process was a bit challenging. I followed the steps to clone both Doom Emacs and the configuration repository, but I&#x27;ve been encountering errors saying that Emacs cannot find my config.el file. I did ensure that the file exists in the appropriate directory, though.
 Secondly, I&#x27;ve had trouble with having Emacs recognized in my $PATH. I installed Emacs using Homebrew and attempted to add it to my $PATH, but the Doom installation script keeps telling me that it can&#x27;t run Emacs.
 To summarize, I&#x27;ve got two main issues:
  
Emacs/Doom Emacs can&#x27;t seem to find my config.el file.
 Having trouble getting Emacs to be recognized in my $PATH.
  
I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide some guidance, tips, or resources to help me sort these issues out and get more comfortable with Emacs on macOS. I&#x27;ve been searching and trying out solutions, but as a beginner, it&#x27;s been quite overwhelming.
 Thanks in advance!
 P.S. If there&#x27;s any additional information you need, please let me know. I&#x27;m keen to learn and make this work!

                              <span>I have started a mooc which uses Emacs. I have only previously used Dr.Racket and Anaconda so I&#x27;m having trouble with how I actually run programs in Emacs.
 I did the tutorial which covers how to edit and navigate text, open and save files.
 I just don&#x27;t understand how you actually write some code and run it?
 In Dr.Racket or Anaconda, I could write some function in say python, that asks user for two numbers, and returns their sum. I&#x27;d write the code, click run, it would prompt me for the two numbers, I&#x27;d enter them and it would return their sum.
 Can anyone explain how I would do this in Emacs? I understand it&#x27;s more powerful text editor I just really can&#x27;t see how to do something simple like the above. I would like to learn how to use Emacs, and the course videos are all done using Emacs so ideally I&#x27;d like to be able to follow along with the videos.
 So yea if someone could explain how I could do what I know how to do in Anaconda, just write a simple function, run it and interact with it, then get a return. I think it might really help me understand the difference between Emacs and Anaconda etc. All the tutorials just talk about editing text. Not writing code, running it and giving it input and seeing the output? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something very obvious but just struggling to see how you go from the text editing to actually running code I have written?

 It&#x27;s better than nothing, but one doesn&#x27;t go the emacs route for &quot;better than nothing&quot;. It&#x27;s not showing symbols. E.g. vscode shows symbols:

 lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-icons-enable is already set to t if someone is going to suggest that.

                              <span>Dear fellow emacsers.
 Given a csv file with columns A, B, C; and rows 1, 2, 3... how do I turn that into a tree, walking it column first?
 So ~~~ | | A | B | C | | 1 | | | | | 2 | | | | | 3 | | | | ~~~
 becomes: ~~~ A *1 *2 *3 B *1 *2 *3 C *1 *2 *3 ~~~
 I saw &quot;GitHub - emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table: Transform org-mode tree with properties to a table, and the other way around&quot; (https://github.com/emacsmirror/org-transform-tree-table) but it works on properties, not the cell value...
 I&#x27;m sure there is something there (and of course 1st I searched on emacs itself), but can&#x27;t find it... I must be using wrong keywords.
 Thanks a ton. :)

I wanted to switch to org mode so I can use its links features, org-roam, and the source blocks, but at the end of the day I want to output a pdf and be able to go from the pdf to the org file as I did with auctex. I found some discussion on this by searching for org-mode with synctex, but the most recent attention this problem got in the mailing list was from 2010. Have there been any updates?

                              <span>Because tree sitter is making a nice opportunity for us to evolve Emacs bindings, I have been pulling together some POC work into a package called user-keys.
 So far it&#x27;s useful for Elisp programmers. I&#x27;m undecided about whether or how to take it to the next level for users. The state of progress:
  
reports and extensible tools for keymap analysis 
 shadows (every single map that binds C-n for example)
 &quot;stupid keys&quot; that you want to delete everywhere
 preferred bindings state
 
 macro proof of concept for abstract key bindings, an idea I&#x27;ve pushed on emacs devel to make ad-hoc conventions like C-n configurable to the user
 lots of groundwork for mass rebinding or unbinding
  
some of the kinds or report generation I created earlier.
 I was going to spike the code and use it as a demonstration for writing a transient UI, but I&#x27;m a little unclear on where to deliver the most value. I&#x27;m not super committed to this package, but felt it had too much utility already to keep it to myself.
 I&#x27;m interested in feature requests, hopes and dreams, (and support for the package or other packages I&#x27;m working on).
 I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of value out of the elisp repo kit (erk) and was able to use a normal TDD style like a civilized person, really making things go faster. I also got some more experience with the dash library and of course immense exposure to the weirdness of Emacs keymap data.

 So I want to just completely uninstall emacs and start over again.
 How ever when I run &quot;brew remove emacs&quot;
 i get the error &quot;Error: cask &quot;emacs&quot; is not installed&quot;
 I have been using it and went through the tutorial so I really don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t uninstall? I&#x27;m completely new to using command line and emacs so I dont even know where to begin. I tried to just remove it from applications folder but there is still several associated files when I search emacs.
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to understand what this error means and how to completely uninstall emacs and all the associated files. Can anyone please explain why I&#x27;m getting this error after I had been succesfully running emacs? surely everything must have been there to be able to open and complete the tutorial?

                              <span>Hi, I am looking for a function in emacs, but no idea how it is called.
 This function exists in logseq under the name Macros.
 For instance, when I enter Trac-2345, logseq knows that it must be replaced by a link to the ticket number 2345 in my Trac ticket system.
 How is it called in emacs and how shall I implement it?
 Thanks for sharing!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using Wanderlust for years, and just now I discovered this issue/problem:
  
I am using Wanderlust (v. 2.15.9) on my main machine and it works just perfect.
 
I am using rsync to &quot;clone&quot; literally whole home folder on my laptop, when I am going on the roads. So I have the same behaviour, messages, notes… in (on) my laptop.
 
Wanderlust (and Emacs of course) works fine, except:
 
I can not delete message(s) from remote (POP) folder, after marking with d and pressing x I get a error message &quot;1 execution(s) were failed&quot; (or more than 1, depends on Nr. of marked messages).
 
 What can be a reason of this?
 Note: I can delete messages from local folders (stored on HDD).
 All the settings like .wl, .folders… are the same.
 Does anybody has any idea how to solve this (actually I can still delete messages from webmail or telnet, this is not a problem, but it&#x27;s little-bit annoying)?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi guys
 I use org-change-tag-in-region a lot in my daily routine. I love it because I can set or unset tags in a huge block of stuff. However, what bugs me is this: When I mark a region to tag/untag all the selected items, it will unmark the items after I set or remove a tag. Is there a way to keep the selection on the text so I don&#x27;t have to mark it all over again to set/unset more tags?
 ty!

                              <span>I recently built emacs from source. I am getting these weird symbols all over the place. It looks like it is failing to display small image files. I have this issue building from the tip of the github tree and emacs-29.0.91.
 The build has gif, jpeg, png, xpm, rsvg2 all enabled. 
 This is happening on Centos-8 and LinuxMint-21.
 Any ideas on what I am missing?

                              <span>Hello!
I am a Bookends user, and I have a nice collection of PDFs associated with references. I was able to dump the references into a *.bibtex file and import it into bibdesk, but I don&#x27;t know how I can attach those PDFs to references in BibDesk. Does someone here know?
Also, bookends supports what they call, I think, &quot;floating citations&quot;, where pressing alt-alt in The Archive brings up a small window where I can search a reference and it pastes, for example, [@Smith1976] into the Archive. This too I&#x27;d love to replicate, but if not available, I can script it easily enough using an unholy mix of Python and Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.
Why I want to switch: Bookends isn&#x27;t very git-friendly; they produce a binary file containing the references instead of a text file like bibtex.
Many thanks!</span>

 I am new to emacs and Org Mode. But I&#x27;m looking to step up my personal notes game and move away from proprietary systems.
 My hope is to use Spacemacs on my various computer and beorg on my phone and iPad to give me a good note and &#x27;second brain&#x27; system.
 This is probably a real simple question, but I have only been at this since yesterday...
 Is there a way to scape a web page into Org format and include it in my notes? Or possiblt just scrape paert of a web page and convert it into org mode.

                              <span>In November 2022, Tweag engineers merged a WebAssembly back end into
the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC).
The back end includes a new translation for control flow, which enables GHC to avoid depending on external tools like Binaryen.
Because the translation is new, we wanted to test it before submitting a merge request.
And classic unit testing was not a good fit—we would have needed to know what
the WebAssembly code was
expected to be generated from any given fragment of Haskell,
and that’s a job for a compiler, not an engineer.
Fortunately, we don’t care
how generated code is written; we care about how it behaves.
Code’s behavior can be tested by running it, but we wanted to test the translation before integrating it with GHC. So we
simulated translated code by tracing possible
executions…</span>

 I&#x27;d like all the stars except the right-most one to have a specific face. The face should apply on top of the already applied &quot;org-level-x&quot; face.

 How can I achieve this? I&#x27;m reading the elisp manual for font-lock but I really can&#x27;t wrap my head around it.

                              <span>I used to be a VSCode user. I&#x27;m a programmer and make my living doing web development these days. Last year I decided I wanted to give Emacs a try. I went for Doom Emacs with the intent of someday making my own config. I used it for a good 6 months at least and fell in love with Emacs. I also decided I wanted to give neovim a fair try. 
 I made a neovim config from scratch. It took me 2 days but I got a really good config which does almost everything I want and I use that as my daily editor for my work without any problems. 
 After I made my neovim config I decided I wanted to make my own Emacs config from scratch and started on tha endeavor. I am so heartbroken to say that after having sunk more than a month into it, having read the 300 pages of the book &quot;Mastering Emacs&quot; by Mickey Peterson, I&#x27;m nowhere close to done. Nothing seems to work like it should. Adding a new packages breaks the functionality of the old ones for whatever reason. 
 I upgraded from emacs 28 to 29 and lsp that worked about fine on my config now doesn&#x27;t work. Company mode seems broken as well. I really want to love Emacs and I&#x27;ve been at it for months now. It&#x27;s starting to seem like a fool&#x27;s errand at this point. 
 after spending almost a year between neovim and emacs, it&#x27;s starting to feel like VSCode wasn&#x27;t all that bad. It did almost everything I wanted from it and I didn&#x27;t have to feel like I was fighting against the very tool that&#x27;s supposed to make me productive.

                              <span>I’ve seen many folks say emacs is great for literate programming, but I wonder what industries use such a thing.
 Is it mostly a tool for data science and scientific computing?
 I was thinking of using org to take notes on and build a knowledge base for tech stuff I’m learning about, and integrated code blocks seem like a good thing for that.

 I actually do not understand how these stuff work, but I assume the big performance leap from this fishbowl performance benchmark.

 So looks like I can only write a few words when using magit commit.
 Is there any option to increase the max commit message in magit?

                              <span>I know this is a shot in the dark and most will probably think that this is a silly proposal, but I figure why not ask?
 Does anyone think that we should have an official Emacs emoji? You can apply for one for free: https://emojipedia.org/proposals/#:~:text&#x3D;Anyone%20can%20submit%20a%20proposal,and%20cannot%20already%20be%20represented.
 Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking:
  
Emacs people don&#x27;t use Emojis
  
A: Well, some of us *do* use them. A lot. Even inside of Emacs.
  
They&#x27;re not going to give it for a piece of software
  
A: Well, Emacs isn&#x27;t just a piece of software. It&#x27;s seen as a philosophy by most people who even know what it is. So maybe we can apply for it under that banner?
 I know the chances of it being approved would be slim but it *is* kind of unique and it *is* a philosophy to many people. So maybe?
 Again: I&#x27;m not expecting a huge response but I figured maybe some here might agree and try anyway?
 Thanks for reading. 🙃

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve been using LanguageTool since 2019 because it&#x27;s open source and has some level of Emacs integration, but I&#x27;m not happy with it anymore as it lets some critical grammar mistakes slide. For instance, LanguageTool couldn&#x27;t detect the two grammar issues here, while Grammarly was able to:
 &quot;I’m in a plane. I thought classes today.&quot; 
 I&#x27;m used to writing markdowns on Emacs, but I don&#x27;t think my setup is adequate anymore.

                              <span>Customize is great, but sometimes it&#x27;s not possible to use it. For example eglot-server-programs is definitely something you&#x27;d maybe want to customize, but it&#x27;s a defvar, which as far as I can tell is impossible to use with customize-set-variable. Same with treesit-language-source-alist. Am I missing something?

 in my .emacs. I don&#x27;t want to have to list out all of the modes that I don&#x27;t have line numbers in since that doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense. Basically in any source file I should have line numbers, but everywhere else (eg. org files, terminals, repls, sidebars) I should not. Any help is appreciated.

 Why are they different. Is there a way to get org-mode indenting to behave like in markdown?

                              <span>I recently picked up learning touch typing to increase my typing speed. I’m also slowing moving my digital life into emacs. I presently use vanilla emacs with default bindings. Just mapped the caps key to control key.
 My rudimentary search in this sub confused me if learning qwerty touch typing makes sense if I use emacs a lot. I realised there are other layouts such as Dvorak which might be more suitable.
 Need suggestions on how to figure out which layout I need to learn?

I tried doing C-s a few times with a string, which works fine, but then the tutorial says to press  a few times, and that it should either move back an occurrence or remove a char from the search string. Mine just deleted the character in front of the cursor. I had this happening in fundamental and text mode, why?

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;N0d7_MJmsKQ&amp;list&#x3D;PLD8gywOEY4HaG5VSrKVnHxCptlJv2GAn7&amp;index&#x3D;4
 In this episode, Edsko will give a user&#x27;s perspective on falsify, his new library for property based testing in Haskell, inspired by the Hypothesis library for Python. This episode will be suitable for beginners. 
 The Haskell Unfolder is a YouTube series about all things Haskell hosted by Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh, with episodes appearing approximately every two weeks. You can use the link above to get to the playlist and watch the other episodes.
 We also have a GitHub repository with the code samples from the episodes: https://github.com/well-typed/unfolder
 And we have a public Google calendar listing the planned schedule: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src&#x3D;c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0@group.calendar.google.com (or ICal: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_327de9ca66caa0307fd99de5b0e3fdd2ad1111ae857bd21659166c74b2b974f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics )

                              <span>Hello! 
I adopted a Plain Text workflow a few years ago. I am on Linux/Windows environments. I&#x27;m not tied to any editor (hence my use of markdown). I use various VIM flavors, VS Code, notepad, and have tried emacs, Zettlr and Obsidian. I&#x27;m fairly comfortable using any of those but am mainly using Zettlr right now. I use pandoc to generate most everything I need either to HTML, docx or PDF via LaTeX. My reference manager of choice is Zotero. I use hypothes.is &quot;somewhat,&quot; but not much. I haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to just pipe those notes into Zotero where I&#x27;d prefer them. My &quot;inbox&quot; is Zotero.
Why am I looking at Zettelkasten after all these years? Because I&#x27;m adventuring out into new phases in my life where I think notetaking and writing are going to become far more important. Mainly in the area of Genealogy. Genealogy has overlap with many topics/cross-overs in history, anthropology, social sciences, archive/library science, DNA, general research, writing. I need a better way to process and use information. While I have degrees in history, anthropology, and engineering, I&#x27;ve work in more practical fields, mainly Tech, for years and am well out of practice in research and writing.
Since I haven&#x27;t seriously written or researched in years, I need to shake the rust off. As part of that effort, I want better techniques to process and store what I&#x27;ve read. I think the &quot;commonplace&quot; tradition (and I fit Zettelkasten in that category for this discussion) is the only methodology that seriously considers the process of taking notes and tying them together. There is, I believe, a fairly complete workflow from figuring out what to read, how to read it, how to take notes about it, how to process those notes (including storage), how to tie notes together, and how to use them for output.
Also, it seems to be the most amenable method to fit into my plain text workflow.
I do have more specific questions, mainly around my notes in Zotero and what to do with them, but I will post them separately.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been watching a growing number of teachers, professors, and researchers who have been transferring their personal note taking, zettelkasten, or personal knowledge management practices into the classroom for students from 6th or 7th grade up into college/university level. As it&#x27;s been a while since this practice was more commonplace (excuse the pun), perhaps it could be useful (and fun) to do a meetup or mini-unconference on the topic to discuss some ideas, practices, and pedagogy?
Format
Depending on everyone&#x27;s general availability, we could do something on a quiet day over the summer break? I&#x27;m thinking something in the 2-4 hour range depending on the level of interest and what folks think would be most productive. At the lower end we could do a few hours as a simple meetup/discussio…</span>

                              <span>Ever since I started using emacs I&#x27;ve progressively moved a lot of my work into emacs, as I suppose is the case for many of you. As such, I devised various workflows, which include creating reproducible org documents, custom LaTeX exports, capturing things to my agenda and to my org-roam Zettelkasten, etc. After a while, I&#x27;ve felt the need to start writing small guides to myself to remind me how I achieved several things which I do frequently but not often enough that I would remember. Do you find yourselves also doing this? Writing little short descriptions on how to do things? If you do, I&#x27;m curious to know what kind of strategy you use for this.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up certain interactions between my window manager (Hyprland) and Emacs, and for various reasons just matching window titles is no longer sufficient. Specifically, I need the minibuffer frame to have a wm_class other than emacs.
 Setting the title is just  (add-to-list &#x27;minibuffer-frame-alist &#x27;(title . &quot;uniquename&quot;)) 
 However this doesn&#x27;t change the class, nor does there appear to be a class frame parameter. Parameters I have tried that don&#x27;t work: class, name, role, instance, x-class, wm-class. 
 I&#x27;ve looked thru the manual and did not find anything related to the Class of frames, only titles and internal parameters.
 It appears from https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/60168/how-can-i-set-wm-class-for-emacs-27 and the bug report linked therein that name used to do this but no longer does because of GTK or something.
 I&#x27;d prefer not to rely on Emacsclient as that interferes with other things.
 What are we supposed to do in this case?

                              <span>So a minor thing, but I took the jump to emacs 29 to start updating configs and such, and was moderately dismayed to note that pretty-mode is somehow not working... most of the time.
 And I&#x27;m not sure how to diagnose. I had followed the (older) base instructions from Mastering Emacs (http://www.modernemacs.com/post/prettify-mode/), with &#x60;(pretty-activate-groups &#x27;(sub-and-superscripts :greek :arithmetic-nary))&#x60; and a set of &#x60;prettify-symbols-alist&#x60; pairs for Python. 
 ...the prettify-symbols-alist pairs work (but look different...sometimes)
 ...the ligatures work...
 ...but greek symbols are nowhere to be found (seemingly in python-mode and python-ts-mode). It&#x27;s a minor thing, but since there&#x27;s a lot of mathematical programming involved, I rather miss it. I don&#x27;t see any error messages in *Messages* but I&#x27;m not sure what I would be looking for.
 Any suggestions? I feel appropriately foolish...

                              <span>Hi! I would like to prevent completions from being suggested to the empty string in inferior-python-mode. 
 To explain a bit better - when the prompt or the string is empty, there are no completions proposed. When I type something, say &quot;a&quot;, I get a number of completions (such as abs, all, any, etc.). 
 If I backspace and get back to the empty string, instead of just getting back to a normal cursor, I get empty string completions such as &quot;%%!&quot;, &quot;%%HTML&quot; and more irrelevant options of the sort. My completion-at-point-functions are (python-shell-completion-at-point comint-completion-at-point t) I&#x27;m using spacemacs with the basic python layer and not too many changes (using ipython as my REPL, with python-shell-completion-native-enable set to true). I hope this might be enough information already to suggest a solution.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done lots of research on this one, lots of references to mobile org which is no longer in the play store, I see orgzly but don&#x27;t see an integrated sync solution. There is org-mobile-pull/push. And then there is the dropbox crew...
 TL;DR: I&#x27;m thinking of setting up a dropbox to copy my daily plan.org file to, so I can keep in check on the go. I&#x27;d need a mobile capture file as well and then I&#x27;d manually parse that into my org system at home when convenient. Intuition says doomed to fail, but I&#x27;d love to hear if anyone has settled on this kind of system, or something better that works robustly.
 (It would be nice to have more access to the rest of the org setup since the items in my plan file tend to be org links to places with notes, followups, tacking info, etc... which would be occasionally nice to have on the go but isn&#x27;t part of the min feature set.)
 ​
 Thanks for any and all help or info. I know this gets asked a lot, but it seems in that deadzone of many half baked solutions that different people sometimes kinda use with apps and libraries that were tried and then have fallen out of favor.

                              <span>I understand that GNU ELPA is the official GNU Emacs package repository and is the only repository enabled by default. I also understand that submitting a package to GNU ELPA is a bit of a hassle and requires an FSF copyright assignment meaning that the official repository has a limited selection of packages.
 Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but a copyright assignment is basically transferring ownership and rights of a specific creative work or works to a third party. So in this case, the third party would be the FSF, right?
 Where as with NonGNU ELPA the FSF doesn&#x27;t ask for copyright assignments for packages meaning they won&#x27;t be able to go into core Emacs? NonGNU ELPA isn&#x27;t enabled by default..? 
 If anyone has a simple, less confusing way of explaining this, please leave a comment. Any feedback is greatly appreciated and I thank you in advance.

                              <span>Edit: added missing info 
 Hi, I am trying to display the ellipsis that shows that the line is larger than the screen, but can&#x27;t find any good solution. What is the name of the variable?
 So far I get this □ character at the right side of the screen for each line, showing that the line is larger than the screen. How to display a proper and nicer symbol?
 Or does it mean that there is a symbol defined, but not supported by the face? (name of the variable?)
 I looked for &quot;ellipsis&quot;... I thought the variable truncate-string-ellipsis was the right one... In my config &quot;...&quot; is defined (and it does work as org-level ellipsis...)
 I am sorry, I am not english and maybe not looking therefore for the right info using the wrong vocabulary...
 Looking for info with  describe-char  did not help...
 Thanks for your support.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have something like S- split a list item between new lines. If I understand correctly, this is the default behavior for org lists. Org-autolist redefines list behavior and removes this. I just want to add this back with a specific keybinding. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I have been having a couple of issues w/ the indentation of SRC blocks under lists (picture attached).
 1) I have an underline enabled for my begin line and an overline enabled for my end line. Under a list, these lines extend all the way across the buffer, while instead, I&#x27;d only like them to extend from the current indentation level to the right side of the buffer.
  
The org-modern-indent package does restrict the length of this line, but it adds some extra fontification to my begin/end lines that I do not want (fringe markers, and a small overbar at the beginning of the begin/end line), and I do not know how to remove these.
  
2) The content of the src is always flush left regardless of indentation level. I think this is probably related to me setting org-src-preserve-indentation to t which I did for other issues w/ indentation.
 ​
 Does anyone have any idea how to fix these issues?

                              <span>Hello, after using Roam Research, Logseq and similar applications for a while, I switched to The Archive because of its simple and clean interface. I keep my notes in a file on my computer and synchronize it with Google Drive. My phone is android. How can I access and edit my The Archive notes on Android with Google Drive synchronization without a sync tool that eats battery? What are your suggestions?</span>

                              <span>Hi Zettlers,
I am thinking about buying a dictation device. I don&#x27;t own a smartphone and want to postpone this state of my life as long as possible. However, when I go on walks with my dogs, I have quite some ideas. I am at the pain threshold of finally doing something about it. 
But I don&#x27;t know what to look for.

the next article will cover how to combine BASB and the Zettelkasten Method. It is a longer article that took quite some work, So I&#x27;d like to publish it as beta first.
If you like to take a first look, give me some feedback, and find a typo or two, please request the link and I&#x27;ll send you the link to a google-doc.

                              <span>I’m a second person reconnecting after a few years away from Scala 2.12 (iirc).
 Anyone done any work at implementing an llm in scala/Java or being able to use JNI for one of the c/c++ implementations? Lama.cpp has been a bit complicated to get working for me. I’d prefer a pure Scala implementation. However, I am way out of my comfort zone with some of this.

                              <span>With Nickel releasing 1.0 I’m excited to announce the 0.1 release
of Tf-Ncl, an experimental tool for writing Terraform deployments with
Nickel instead of HCL.
Tf-Ncl enables configurations to be checked against Terraform provider-specific
contracts, before calling Terraform to perform the deployment. Nickel
can natively generate outputs as JSON, YAML or TOML; since Terraform can accept
its deployment configuration as JSON, you can straightforwardly export a Nickel
configuration, adhering to the right format, to Terraform. Tf-Ncl provides
a framework for ensuring a Nickel configuration has this specific format.
Specifically, Tf-Ncl is a tool to generate Nickel contracts that describe the
configuration schema expected by a set of Terraform providers.
This approach means that Terraform doesn…</span>

 Which makes me wonder if there is any way to have async/await behavior in emacs, so that the next function runs only after the buffers are ready:
 (add-hook &#x27;ein:ipynb-mode-hook (lambda () (cl-letf (((symbol-function &#x27;read-directory-name) (lambda (_prompt dir &amp;rest _args) dir))) (ein:process-find-file-callback) (mapc &#x27;switch-to-buffer (cl-remove-if-not (lambda (b) (and (string-match-p &quot;ein&quot; (buffer-name b)) (string-match-p &quot;ipynb&quot; (buffer-name b)))) (buffer-list))) (delete-other-windows) )))

 The first json/ipynb buffer slows down emacs considerably and it&#x27;s only needed to trigger ein-mode to start server - is there any way to stop loading of that first buffer midway to speed startup times?

I&#x27;m curious, do any of you also utilize Toolbox, and if so, what has been your experience with it?

 On Mac I&#x27;m using the version from emacsforosx.com On Linux I&#x27;m using the package from the Arch repos.
 For some reason, ispell has a keybinding of s-: on the Mac and no binding set on the Linux machine.
 I can confirm that the super key is available for binding on my Linux machine within Emacs.
 Can someone help explain why there is this disparity?

                              <span>Hi,
 This isn&#x27;t an Emacs issue, but an intermittent problem I&#x27;m having with my home wifi. But Emacs has provided the latest clue.
 I was trying to update my packages via M-x package-display-packages. This brings up the list of packages as expected, but when I try to &#x27;update all&#x27; via &#x27;U&#x27;, I get the message &quot;waiting for refresh to finish&quot;. Only it didn&#x27;t, after many minutes, when it usually takes a few seconds.
 This lead to many rabbit holes, until I discovered that the problem happens on my home wifi network, but if I switch to my cellular network (via a phone hotspot), the problem disappears - I can refresh my package list almost instantly.
 This makes me suspect other issues with services hanging when on my home network (but not on my cell data) may be related. 
 So: how does Emacs connect to elpa/melpa/etc? I&#x27;m hoping understanding this better might help me resolve my network issues.
 Other observations:
  
while the package update hung, I could still load webpages, including those for the repositories I use (elpa, melpa)
 
using curl -I to connect to the repositories also worked, even while I couldn&#x27;t refresh the package list.
 
I build Emacs from source, and the problem existed on the previous build yesterday (which was several months old), and the latest build from sources pulled last night.
 
 As I said, not an Emacs issue, but maybe Emacs not being able to contact the repositories is a clue to the network issue?
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks,

                              <span>Do you have any experience with both Eat (https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/eat.html) and vterm (https://melpa.org/#/vterm) ? Do you have any preference between them?
 I&#x27;m finally taking the plunge and switching fully from Windows to Linux. Getting vterm on Windows was too involved to make me switch from my dedicated terminal emulator, but the process seems much more doable on Linux, so I&#x27;ve been considering it.
 However, I&#x27;ve also seen people praise Eat, but it seems like less people are familiar with it. And so I got curious whether people who have used both have a strong preference.
 If so, would you mind sharing a little about why you find one more appealing/ergonomic or why it may be more efficient/powerful than the other?

 Does anyone has an idea what this could be? The file file.py is open in a buffer and I&#x27;m working on it.
 I know about auto-save (#file#) and backup files (file~). But what is .#file about? And why is it symlinked to a server-xyz-thing. Never seen a symlink like this.

                              <span>In the EmacsWiki I found this code snippet about how to set the emacs window transparent.
  (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) &#x27;alpha &#x27;(85 . 50)) (add-to-list &#x27;default-frame-alist &#x27;(alpha . (85 . 50))) 
 The first line alone works fine. So why do I need the second line? What this this list about?
 The Wiki do not explain it. And the emacs-in-build-help doesn&#x27;t help me either. I don&#x27;t understand it.

 How do I resolve this error?
 I created the calendar.org file in the relevant ~/Dropbox/org section of my config so I think it is something to do with /tmp permissions?
 The programs will allow me to sync both my Google and my Etesyc Contacts and Calendars. Etesync also needs Etesync-Dav installed on the desktop but that is well explained on Github.
 Basically I have Google Calendar because of my iTalki lesson appointments and Airline Flight bookings which automagically appear there. Etesync is for anything else as I want to reduce my dependence on Google.
 ID properties created in file &quot;/tmp/khalel-capture-NajqkZ-tmp.org&quot; Wrote /tmp/khalel-capture-NajqkZ-tmp.ics Buffer calendar.org modified; kill anyway? (y or n) y org-back-to-heading: Directory / write-protected 
 There is no information in the buffer Khalel Errors.
 Yes I am on Doom Emacs but I think this is specific to Khalel or maybe Debian.

I&#x27;m trying to make less and less of these #meta-ZK notes. This is one of two #meta-ZK notes in the last ten days. An improvement over many 10-day time spans, but still two too many.
Bring on the comments. Lossen the bulls!

Subatomic: The magic comes from the repetition of adding your thoughts to the notes you take and reviewing notes regularly.

                              <span>I made a website long ago with org-mode, and kind of used emacs as a static site generator.(Works great for everything except customising the html)
 The config for org-publish is setup in org-publish-project-alist
 currently, it looks something like this 
 (setq org-publish-project-alist &#x27;((&quot;my-project&quot; :base-directory &quot;path/to/source&quot; :publishing-directory &quot;path/to/publish&quot; :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html :html-preamble &quot;ALL the html code in here&quot;))) 
 It&#x27;s getting pretty cumbersome to write html in a string, so is there any way to add an external html file which will get sourced in the location of html-preamble?

 Is there an example configuration somewhere?

                              <span>I am looking for a tool to organize my life and take notes for undergrad engineering studies — which is exactly what org-mode is perfect for. I would prefer to use Neovim instead though. 
 I feel like emacs seems like a walled garden — where I’ll start to feel like everything I do on a computer needs to be done in emacs, as opposed to using a variety of different purpose-built tools together for task management and note taking.
 I could just use: - Markdown and LaTeX plus vimwiki to take notes - Task- and time-warrior for an agenda and to-do list - Ledger for financial management - Various shell or Python scripts to tie things together
 I’ve seen that people switch to emacs entirely for org-mode, however, and I can’t shake the feeling that I should maybe switch over.
 Edit: I definitely used “walled garden” the wrong way here; I meant that I might feel like I have to use emacs to do everything instead of having more flexibility to use other software. I see what y’all mean though, I don’t have to use it for everything if I don’t want.

                              <span>Some years ago, I wrote myself a tool to download financial transactions from my bank and put them into a ledger journal. I found that manually entering the transaction with the hledger interface was too tedious for me.
 The tool uses the german FinTS standard, so the number of supported banks is limited.
 I&#x27;ve now released a new version that is mainly written in Haskell instead of Python. I did that because I noticed that I am much more likely to work on Haskell projects in my free time, simply because it is more fun for me.
 Unfortunately, this complicated the setup process somewhat, as one can no longer just run pip install fints2ledger. I would love to improve this in the future but don&#x27;t really know a better way.
 Code feedback is also appreciated, especially from the perspective of people not too familiar with Haskell.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a student, and I accidentally used the &quot;quick fix&quot; option. however it seemed to be some sort of quick fix that changed the enviroment fully, and I don&#x27;t know how to change it. it was a change of adding &quot;add.splash.string.&quot;... it was something like that, if it can help to have a idea of the category that has been changed.
 The thing is THIS code worked for my teacher, but as for me it doesn&#x27;t! so it made a change about how declare and i can&#x27;t do it right. this is making me difficult to practice for the test.
 I tried to undo, but I closed VSC before, thinking that it&#x27;ll undo itself. however it didn&#x27;t and I can&#x27;t undo it anymore.
 I tried to reinstall VSC... but as you can see, it didn&#x27;t helped neither. all the config stay there.
 what can I do now?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with python lately, and on a few occasions I evaluate variables that end up producing a ton of output (e.g. dumping 1,000 filepaths).
 In my terminal, the output finishes in less than 1 second. In emacs it makes the editor unusable for about 10-20 seconds.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried enabling global-so-long-mode and disabling font locking in the inferior python buffer, which are the solutions I found online, but that is still resulting in unusable performance.
 Has anyone solved this? Two potential solutions I thought of would be either to find a way to truncate output and creating a command to expand it when needed, or to find a way to connect to a remote python repl running in another terminal tab, but I&#x27;m not sure how to do either of those.

                              <span>I have all my config in a single giant org mode file. This file produces three others when tangled, init.el, early-init.el and a custom theme for my colorscheme. Problem is, whenever I make a change in the org file, and tangle the changes, the git repo for my dotfiles now sees two different files being modified (obviously) with the same changes. It makes it really cumbersome to do proper commits, since if I did many changes and I&#x27;d like to do various commits for each of them, I have to add not only the changes in the org file, but also hunt down the same modifications in the init and early-init files (mostly init tho).
 I recently tried to fix this by dropping all of the init.el contents into some other file, call it &quot;real-init.el&quot;. Then, I would have a very minimal init.el that would check if init and early-init exist, and if they don&#x27;t, it would tangle the org file and restart emacs. I would just keep track of the org file and the minimal init file in the git repo, and since the init file is very minimal and wouldn&#x27;t change very often, it would be a fine compromise.
 For some odd reason, while the files did get tangled, emacs would just restart indefinitely. It opened, then closed, then opened, then closed. I had to force kill it.
 Has anyone else faced this problem? How did you solve it?

 I&#x27;ve tries setting the lsp-clients-deno-import-map to the impart_map.json file in the project folder, but still that didn&#x27;t work.
 Any suggestions or links to a working configurations that I can have a look at?

 Try opening ipython notebook in vscode. Then try to open ipython notebook via emacs.
 Vscode takes you directly to the rendered buffer ready to edit in less than a second.
 Emacs won&#x27;t work and won&#x27;t tell you how to fix it. You go search for a package - you find ein. You get it installed, you get jupyter package install. Turns out it was the wrong package, so now you get the correct jupyter notebook pacakge installed. It turns out that ein now needs you to separately start the server, open the server, switch to the file that you ALREADY HAD OPENED and then switch to that buffer. It opens five other buffers in the meantime, three of them cluttering your workspace.
 It also crashed twice while getting there...
 I don&#x27;t doubt that it has some great features going (extensibility, minimalism), but for the love of emperor don&#x27;t be an idiot and create sane defaults!
 This is the time where you can&#x27;t pretend anymore and have to admit that vscode extension just did it plain better...

 Currently, I see diagnostics as virtual text.

                              <span>I use org-refile to navigate and file things all the time. While it is functional, I have long craved something a little more flexible.
 So I&#x27;ve written a package that allows you to programmatically set composable shortcuts for org-refile.
 https://github.com/thread314/org-navigator
 It allows the user to set prefix shortcut keys to various actions (refile to, go-to, clock in to etc), and combine these with suffix keys that define the target for the desired action.
 So for example, typing C-c fa might file the current subtree to the subtree set to &quot;a&quot;, whereas C-c ia would instead jump to that subtree and open it in an indirect buffer.
 It also allows the user to define the destination suffix keys by setting a property on the target subtree itself from within the org-mode file.
 I&#x27;m not a programmer so always very open to any feedback or suggestions.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to troubleshoot problems of Tramp via ssh on remote FreeBSD or MacOS. Tramp works fine when the remote is Linux.
 I&#x27;ve set this at the first line of the remote .zshrc in the case of MacOS:
 [[ $TERM &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;dumb&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; unsetopt zle &amp;&amp; PS1&#x3D;&#x27;$ &#x27; &amp;&amp; return 
 At least connect does not just hang, but it shows this (testing connecting to localhost):
 /ssh:USER@localhost:/Users/USER:
 (blank page)
 ​
 The value of dired-listing-switches is &quot;-al&quot;.

 Anything to try here? I&#x27;ve tried starting up Emacs with -Q to rule out any local config. The Emacs I&#x27;m using is on MacOS and version is:
 GNU Emacs 30.0.50 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin22.4.0, NS appkit-2299.50 Version 13.3.1 (a) (Build 22E772610a)) of 2023-05-02

                              <span>Hi, first post here. I have a noob question arround Org Babel. I want to generate an error for didactic purposes on a Java code. There is a way to evaluate the SRC code block and output the error message? Currently the code executes, stdout the expected errors in another buffer but don&#x27;t show the errors in the results section. Here is my code:
 #+begin_src java float a &#x3D; 3; float b &#x3D; 2; float div &#x3D; a / b; int sum &#x3D; a + b; int mult &#x3D; a * b; int subt &#x3D; a - b; System.out.println(&quot;Sum: &quot; + sum + &quot; || Sub: &quot; + subt + &quot; || Mult: &quot; + mult + &quot; || Div: &quot; + div); #+end_src 
 The idea is to show the type error under the #+RESULTS:Section

 My tex output is:
  \lstset{basicstyle&#x3D;\linespread{0.85}\ttfamily,numbers&#x3D;left, numberstyle&#x3D;\tiny,frame&#x3D;tb,tabsize&#x3D;4,columns&#x3D;fixed,showstringspaces&#x3D;false, showtabs&#x3D;false,keepspaces&#x3D;true,commentstyle&#x3D;\color{red},keywordstyle&#x3D;\color{blue}, breaklines&#x3D;true,captionpos&#x3D;t,language&#x3D;Lisp,label&#x3D;lst1, caption&#x3D;{hello world},captionpos&#x3D;b} 
 since, captionpos&#x3D;b is adding itself at last, its overriding my value captionpos&#x3D;t. I looked into ox-latex and I found this:
 &#x60;((&quot;captionpos&quot; ,(if caption-above-p &quot;t&quot; &quot;b&quot;))). 
 I do not understand caption-above-p, how is it assigned?
 How can I stop adding captionpos&#x3D;b or make it &#x3D;t?
 Note: I am using Doom Emacs.
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>I have been learning about tagless final. I prepared a simple usecase to just create user in a repository. I started with example based tests and also tried with property based testing. Had some doubts and got it clarified in stackoverflow. My intention was to have a defined set of rules for the UserAlgebra. Since the interpreters are expected to follow the same rules, it would be easier to develop. Usually, I start with an InmemoryInterpreter implementation. Later another interpreter would be implemented for the real persistence based repository. 
 Slowly, I got pulled in cats-laws &amp;&amp; disciple with scalacheck until I ran into a considerably long phase that I dont understand why the compilation fails. 
 Here is the snippet. https://scastie.scala-lang.org/itsnashter/HxcapljGSZylOtLyssJbLg/2. Can experts take a look to help me understand the following? 
  
What is the general convention to test the tagless final algebraic resources? I dont want to use unsaferunSync() even in tests. 
 Is having laws for repositories like &quot;create and get&quot; ( &amp; rest like mentioned in scastie) really needed ? The Laws look like they were meant for structures like Monad. 
 Cats laws seem interesting but there is not much to understand for a beginner like me. Are there any blogs?

                              <span>I am working the Exercism Haskell Track and one of the questions asks for a custom set implementation. I studied some community solutions to see what other folks are doing, and came across something that I don&#x27;t quite understand.
 intersection :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; CustomSet a isDisjointFrom :: (Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; CustomSet a -&gt; Bool isDisjointFrom &#x3D; (null .) . intersection 
 What is this (null .) . intersection ? Should it not be just null . intersection ?

 I have decided to extract my Haskell snippets for LuaSnip into a plugin: haskell-snippets.nvim.
 For those who don&#x27;t know LuaSnip, here&#x27;s an introduction. If you have nvim-treesitter and the parser for Haskell installed, and if you use haskell-language-server, some snippets will be enhanced (e.g. qualified imports and module names).
 I&#x27;ve only recently migrated to LuaSnip, and I expect to add more snippets that leverage tree-sitter and the LSP client in the future (probably also for Nix).

 Apparently the problem due to SimplifedSubsumption and there are two work around. Add an explict type signature or turn on DeepSubsumption. What is still strange in that the problem only occurs with ghci, so I suppose there is a third workaround somewhere having to do with ghci &quot;defaulting&quot; things.

 I&#x27;m trying to migrate my project to a new version of GHC and encounter the following problem (see my previous post). I narrowed it down to the following
 authFA :: AuthPlugin App authFA &#x3D; AuthPlugin &quot;fa&quot; dispatch loginWidget where dispatch &#x3D; \_ _ -&gt; postLoginR &gt;&gt;&#x3D; sendResponse 
 Doesn&#x27;t compile , if replace dispatch with its body
 authFA :: AuthPlugin App
 authFA &#x3D; AuthPlugin &quot;fa&quot; (_ _ -&gt; postLoginR &gt;&gt;&#x3D; sendResponse) loginWidget
 This compiles. I believe this as to do with type defaulting rules but the original code compiled fine with GHC 8.10 but not with GHC 9.2.5.
 Any ideal ?

 I&#x27;m trying to migrate a project from lts-18-17 to lts-20.11 and I have a strange issue.
 For some reason my AuthPlugin doesn&#x27;t compile anymore even thought according to the release not nothing major has changed on the AuthPlugin side (neither on my project). The error message is a bit cryptic so instead i&#x27;m replace disptach with a hole to see what the exact problem.
 I get the following

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m a newbie at haskell. I want to construct something very simple: Classes for unary and binary operators. Each class should have only one function: evaluate. Something like this:
 class UnaryOperator a where evaluate :: a -&gt; a class BinaryOperator a where evaluate :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a 
 In C++, I would do something like
 template class Operator { public: static T evaluate() &#x3D; delete; ~Operator() {} }; template class UnaryOperator : public Operator { public: static T evaluate(T) &#x3D; delete; }; template class BinaryOperator : public Operator { public: static T evaluate(T, T) &#x3D; delete; }; class Cos : public UnaryOperator { public: static float evaluate(float x){return std::cos(x);} }; class Sum : public BinaryOperator { public: static float evaluate(float a, float b){return a + b;} }; int main() { float a &#x3D; 1.0; float b &#x3D; 3.0; float sum &#x3D; Sum::evaluate(a, b); float cos &#x3D; Cos::evaluate(sum); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;sum &#x3D; &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl &lt;&lt; &quot;cos(sum) &#x3D; &quot; &lt;&lt; cos &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } 
 Is there anything similar in Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about my ZK and if it supports my dreams. I wonder if I&#x27;m feeding it appropriately. Maybe I should articulate the dream I have for my zettelkasting. &quot;I want it to support my writing.&quot; Is this clear enough? Should I rearticulate it more concretely? What does support mean if I break it down as my stated goal?
Of course, that means that I have to start writing. Does journaling count? Part of how I&#x27;ve procrastinated writing is trying to automate my irregular blog posting. I&#x27;ve spent too much time exploring other alternatives. Automating the publishing of a post is difficult or impossible with my web host, Squarespace.
Here is a fine example of &#x27;Task Switching as opposed to Flow,&#x27; my most recent note. I should take my advice and start and see what develops.
I&#x27;ve been wrestling with Python. I am learning new skills like the application of decorators, building modules, and profiling.

 I am wondering if it is possible to tangle src blocks from a given .org such that the .el file is created in a separate folder. Any possible leads? Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent quite a lot of time in LISP-land over the last few years and have internalized and begun to rely on a lot of nifty paredit features, for example slurping and barfing.
 When writing and editing, for example, JavaScript or C++ code I end up situations where I instinctively try to slurp identifiers with, obviously, no success.
 Even though there are relatively few cases where this would make sense in non-sexp code, there are the cases of the misplaced parens, for example.. given the code:
 some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); 
 If I decide that I want to wrap one of these arguments in a function, I&#x27;d place the cursor before the argument and enter the function name followed by a left-paren, the mode will be kind and automatically insert a closing paren and I end up with the following, with the cursor inside the parens of &#x60;awesomify&#x60;
 some_nifty_function_call(my_sweet_sweet_variable, awesomify()another_splendid_variable, awesomest_variable_of_them_all); 
 This is where I&#x27;d like to do the equivalent of a slurp, effectively moving that closing paren to the end of the next expression - after ànother_splendid_variable&#x60;, but before the comma.
 ​
 I figure I can&#x27;t be the first one to experience the want for something like this. Does it exist? If not, does anyone have a good idea how to implement a minor mode for this?
 It doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% fool-proof for my needs, and I figure it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to just make a dumb language-agnostic implementation for the exact example above. But I&#x27;d also like it to be DWIM:y enough and handle more complex expressions, in which case the mode would somehow need to hook into the syntax model of the language.
 Discuss! Or.. fight! Or insult me. I&#x27;m thankful for basically any thoughts on the matter that could move me in the right direction.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m testing out Void Linux but I&#x27;m having problems with Emacs/EXWM. Essentially the terminal modes are extremely slow when I first start them after starting Emacs. Similarly commands using the (shell-command) function take a long time, and often X applications like Firefox start very slowly.
 I&#x27;ve tried making a custom build of Emacs (people say they had problems with the package on the Void repo) but the problem persists.
 I don&#x27;t have this problem when I run the same config on Arch or Nixos, so I suspect it might be something to do with Void.
 Any other Void users have this problem too?

 I have them bound to flymake-goto-next-error and flymake-goto-prev-error in programming modes.

                              <span>Hello, lovely people. I am trying to get into the emacs. To accompany me in writing notes in org.
 I read the TUTORIAL which helped me to understand basics of emacs. I installed evil-mode(because i am a nevom user and i cannot live without vim bindings).
 But i am trying to create a setup that will help me, create a workflow that i can use as my second brain. I use zettelkasten system for writing notes.
 Are there any packages that use for note taking other then the org-mode.
 Also suggest packages to improve the UI of org files. Like heading symbols, themes, etc.
 Any useful resources on how to use emacs to take notes(Mainly blogs i don&#x27;t like videos).

 Sharing my note about fs2-kafka.
 Agenda:
  
make a quick introduction to fs2.Pipe notion;
 discuss possibilities and limitations of turning error-flow into explicit pipeline;
 highlight some non-obvious aspects of offset commitment (especially when we distribute offsets over multiple streams);
 show Weaver suite.

 I hope it&#x27;ll be helpful for somebody :)
 And will be grateful for the feedback!

 import Test.Tasty import Test.Tasty.SmallCheck as SC main :: IO () main &#x3D; defaultMain $ testGroup &quot;Tests&quot; [ SC.testProperty &quot;non-zeros&quot; (changeDepth succ nonZero) ] where nonZero :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool nonZero a b &#x3D; a * b /&#x3D; 0 
 How do I only use non-zero values over my Property?

                              <span>ExceptT from mtl seems to be accumulating errors unlike the deprecated ErrorT. But I do not want it to accumulate errors because that can lead to a space leak when using manyTill equivalents from Alternative. Does anyone know how to get around this? Is there an alternative that does not accumulate errors? Alternatively, can I access the error in some way to force it?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Is there any possibilties to get lsp support and anaconda support while editing remote files on hpc (sun grid engine) and send code lines for python, R or other interpreted languages like I could do in other IDE but there remotely ?
 I thought about install emacs remotely and use tmux session with multiple emacs open, but I am not sure it would be easy (no sudo privileges).
 Also, I am not sure if this is the best set up for working with emacs on hpc.
 PS: I am using Doom emacs

                              <span>Hi there folks, 
 This is my very first post in Emacs community. I am following System Crafters video and wanted to see how would one go about creating multiple projectile projects in its config. Mine currently only shows a single project. I don&#x27;t know how Emacs recognizes project directories:
 (use-package projectile
 :diminish projectile-mode
 :config (projectile-mode)
 :custom ((projectile-completion-system &#x27;ivy))
 :bind-keymap
 (&quot;C-c p&quot; . projectile-command-map)
 :init
 (when (file-directory-p &quot;~/Projects&quot;)
 (setq projectile-project-search-path &#x27;(&quot;~/Projects&quot;)))
 (setq projectile-switch-project-action #&#x27;projectile-dired))
 How to include manual npm projects or git repositories in here ?

 What I am missing is a link to the attached file systematically added in the buffer I am working from, or at least in the clipboard, so that I can include it using org-link
 How can I do it in emacs? Thanks for your support

 Before I try to roll my own, as I have not been able to find a package for this: is there a way to auto insert matching braces context at end braces in programming mode please? As overlay is best for me, but as text could work too. 
 Example.
 If( my condition ) {
 // Some code
 } // my condition &lt;&#x3D; this is inserted as overlay

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I recently installed Emacs 29 with native comp and ImageMagick flags on my system. However, Homebrew also installed a bunch of formulas related to ImageMagick that I believe I will never use. As a result, my brew list looks messy and cluttered.
 I would like to know if there&#x27;s a way to uninstall ImageMagick and all the formulas that were installed alongside it?
 (Note: I&#x27;m on MacOS and I use emacs-plus to install emacs)
 Any guidance on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you in advance!

Have added it to path but when I start emacs, there is no change to it at all. I am guessing emacs is not picking up the correct init file but I am not sure why.
 Info about my system: Running Arch, I have XDG_CONFIG_DIR set so instead of doom install installing it to the normal ~/.emacs.d/ and ~/.doom.d directories, the things are installed under .config/emacs and .config/doom directories. Reading up the doc it says emacs respects the XDG spec.
 I tried loading the init file under ~/.config/doom/ manually by using emacs -q --load but no change there as well.
 Any help would be great

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m wording the question correctly. I have packages installed for scala which includes lsp-mode, which depends on markdown-mode 2.3 and I have obsidian which depends on markdown-mode 2.5. Somehow this was satisfied before I deleted markdown-mode.
 I want to modify markdown-mode, so I&#x27;m using source from git and now either lsp-mode or obsidian-mode complains depending on which version of markdown-mode I have.
 How can I fix that?

                              <span>For a long time, I didn&#x27;t annotate my reading materials because I preferred reading on my tablet instead of my computer. And I never found a good app to use on my Android tablet either. And of course, without proper conversion to org-mode, all of those notes seemed useless.
 Then I discovered org-noter. I was excited but couldn&#x27;t use it. The automatic window handling was frustrating, and I couldn&#x27;t invest the time to fix it. Recently, I needed to take notes from multiple books, so I tried org-noter again, but I still can&#x27;t find the best workflow.
 My initial issue was with the way how org-noter creates a &quot;special&quot; layout with a dedicated window. It sometimes even creates another frame - which I especially hate, even setting org-noter-always-create-frame to nil still occasionally creates a frame. I guess not a huge deal, I can live with that.
 After taking some notes, I noticed they were out of sync the next day. I tried to fix each note&#x27;s page number manually - :NOTER_PAGE: prop, but it would randomly change the page numbers in other notes. Yes, I would open a page in pdf-tools, then I call org-noter-sync-current-page-or-chapter to check if the note and the page numbers match and fix them (when needed). But it also would change page numbers in some other notes. I can&#x27;t figure out why. Clearly, either I&#x27;m doing something wrong, or I need to set some vars or it&#x27;s just a bad combination of things, versions of pdf-tools, poppler, Emacs, etc. on my machine causing these issues. Maybe (like so many things) it just never properly worked on Mac?
 I want this tool to work, but I am struggling to find a workflow that fits. If my notes are consistently out of sync, I can&#x27;t see the point of using org-noter. Can someone please advise me on their workflow, tips, and configuration?

 It&#x27;s a story worth sharing with my colleages—a testament to the significance of investing in robust base operational systems built on cloud native and open-source solutions.
 🆕 🆕 🆕
 Considering the current landscape in the market and the growing prominence of ML/NLT/Embedding generation (much more in the Search playground) and the associated cost in large and sometimes inappropriate voluminous training processes, we have a unique opportunity to leverage these advancements to add value to our products without the need for additional investments in specialised and custom solutions.
 This video and the way we operate our data processes holds true now more than ever.
 Ramiro and Daniel, our presence on that stage was truly massive, let&#x27;s continue pushing boundaries and seizing these opportunities.

                              <span>Im new to this Forum and i already wrote a new Post, but it somehow does not appear. So sorry if it ends up being posted 2 times.
I want to start a digital Zettelkasten. 
But software like Obsidian, The Archive only work with keyboard input. I tryed to workaround a little bit:
downside is, i can not update, annotate or work later with the note. annotator in obsidian is pretty bad with pdfs. so the only solution would be to again start the process and update the file in notabillity reupload etc etc etc… terrible workflow.
excalidraw is also pretty bad, compared to notability and goodnotes. not a real option.
is there anyone with the same problem? someone who likes handwritten notes, but dont want to start an analog zettelkasten. the missing search function is real.
i would use notability, but i can not connect and link the notes.
im thankfull for every idea.

                              <span>I am wholly unsurprised that Harold Innis (1894-1952) maintained a card index (zettelkasten) through his research life, but I am pleased to have found that his literary estate has done some work on it and published it as The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis (University of Toronto Press, 1980). The introduction seems to have some fascinating material on the form and structure as well as decisions on how they decided to present and publish it.
For those unaware of his work, primarily as a political economist, he wrote extensively on media and communication theory including the influential works Empire and Communications (1950) and The Bias of Communication (1951). 
While I appreciate the published book nature of the work, it would be quite something to have it excerpted back down to index card form as a piece of material culture to purchase and play around with. Perhaps something in honor of the coming 75th anniversary of his passing?

                              <span>Really weird problem here. I&#x27;m writing my thesis in org-mode. All has been well (after some tweaking) so far, but I have an issue where starting a new section title with the word &quot;Discussion&quot; turns the word red and into a different font, and it shows up in a different font in my Table of Contents. Adding a letter or taking one away fixes it. Not capitalizing it fixes it. Writing &quot;Conclusion and Discussion&quot; fixes it but &quot;Discussion and Conclusions&quot; does not. Only the word Discussion turns red and changes fonts. I have no idea where to begin troubleshooting this :) Anyone have any ideas?
 EDIT: the tex export shows the line \section{{\bfseries\sffamily Discussion} and Conclusions} where the section header is. So something in org thinks I want the word Discussion to automatically change font family for some godforsaken reason. At least I can fix it there for now.

                              <span>Rustic defines its own mode but I don&#x27;t want to use their functions (rustic-compile and rustic-recompile). I tried to wrap compile in my own function (after I&#x27;ve exported rustic-compilation-mode):
 (defun my/compile (command &amp;optional comint) (let ((compilation-mode rustic-compilation-mode)) (compile command comint))) 
 (consider that I&#x27;ve put interactive where needed etc).
 The function works but the mode is compilation-mode, not rustic-compilation-mode. If I M-x rustic-compilation-mode inside this buffer the proper mode is loaded and I can navigate through errors.
 Is there a way to change the major mode of a compilation buffer without having to set it manually after the compilation has ended?

                              <span>I moved to eglot and so far so good, the only thing a bit annoying is when doing a eglot-rename it doesn&#x27;t show the symbol about to be renamed in the initial input. 
 Usually when I do a rename is not to type a complete new symbol but to actually tweak the name, so currently have to do a bunch of M-/ to get it and then tweak it...
 Maybe that&#x27;s not the behavior people expect and rather have a blank initial input ?
 It&#x27;s easy to override the function directly:
 (defun eglot-rename (newname) &quot;Rename the current symbol to NEWNAME.&quot; (interactive (list (read-from-minibuffer (format &quot;Rename &#x60;%s&#x27; to: &quot; (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;unknown symbol&quot;)) (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;&quot;) nil nil nil (symbol-name (symbol-at-point))))) (eglot--server-capable-or-lose :renameProvider) (eglot--apply-workspace-edit (jsonrpc-request (eglot--current-server-or-lose) :textDocument/rename &#x60;(,@(eglot--TextDocumentPositionParams) :newName ,newname)) current-prefix-arg)) 
 wandering if there is a better way to do this (with advice?) than overriding ?
 maybe i should just ask it nicely to the eglot maintainer?

                              <span>We are glad to announce streamly 0.9.0 release. streamly-0.9.0 and streamly-core-0.1.0 have been available on Hackage for some time now, you can find reference documentation and some guides on https://streamly.composewell.com as well. The website also has functionality to search across multiple streamly packages.
 This release did a major revamp of the API to make it easier to comprehend and less error prone to use. Now there is a single &quot;Stream&quot; type instead of the polymorphic &quot;IsStream&quot; type class. There are explicit concurrency combinators to enable concurrent behavior on the same type instead of using different types for that purpose.
 Dependency on GHC rewrite rules has been removed for more robust behavior and better programmer control, though it required splitting the stream type into the default direct-style type &quot;Stream&quot; and the CPS type &quot;StreamK&quot;.
 The package has been split into two, streamly-core intends to depend only on boot libraries (currently has some more deps due to backward compatibility), streamly provides higher level functionality like concurrency.
 Parser functionality has been released. Parsers fuse with streams and are compatible with folds i.e. parsers are folds with more power.
 See the following docs for more details:

                              <span>Hi, Im a haskell beginner and as of now just coding some really basic stuff and trying to develop a familiarity with the language. So I wanted to write the haskell equivalent of the intentionally wrongly written fibonnaci code below and I realised I just probably...can&#x27;t?
 void fib (int a, int b, int n) {
 if( n &lt;&#x3D; 0) return;
 if(b &lt;&#x3D; 0 ){
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, a);
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, b + 1);
 fib (a, b + 1, n-2);
 } 
 //bruh block
 int c &#x3D; a + b;
 printf(&quot;%d &quot;, c);
 fib (b, c, n - 1 );
 } 
 int main( ) {
 fib( 0, 0, 5); 
 }
 in this code, i&#x27;ve intentionally left the bruh block of code independent of the block above,i.e., not bind it to the previous if block using an else and that obviosuly produces a output different from the expected fibonacci one. I tried building the haskell equiavlent using guards and if-else-thens and in the process i realised there&#x27;s probably no way to build a freely floating independent block of code in a function that has other conditionals in haskell???....Or is there a way to do it?

                              <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

GHC 9.6.2 is now available by Ben Gamari
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.2. This release is primarily a bug-fix release addressing a few issues found in 9.6.1.
Stack version 2.11.1 by Mike Pilgrem
Haskell Language Server 2.0.0.0 is now available by Zubin Duggal
This is a fairly small release, marking the start of a new versioning scheme where HLS and all the included packages in the distribution will be versioned in lockstep.

                              <span>Tweagers have an engineering mantra — Functional. Typed. Immutable. —
that begets composable software which can be reasoned about and avails
itself to static analysis. These are all “good things” for building
robust software, which inevitably lead us to using languages such as
Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
Last time I wrote about how we can use Python’s1
abstract base classes to express useful concepts and primitives that are
common in functional programming languages. In this final episode, I’ll
cover testing strategies that can be learnt from functional programming
and applied to your Python code.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but apparently when you use the VSCode Neovim plugin, you are actually running Neovim in the backend, so it allows you to do most of Neovim stuff there.
 Can we do the same with emacs? Even if it has a bunch of limits in what we can use, it would be nice to be able to use at least some of emacs stuff (in the very least the keybindings) when you have to use something else for emacs.
 For instance, I would absolutely love if I could use emacs in the backend when I&#x27;m working in collaborative Google Docs.
 Is that possible?

 Is it possible for a macro to know file and line location of where it is expanded?

 ​
 So, started wanting to do everything inside emacs so I configured my &#x60;.emacs&#x60; file so I can read my email and chat on slack. I also started browsing the web with emacs. just simple stuff. but the idea is that when im programming i can do all this during my breaks. 
 i wanted to hear other experiences and learn about how others live inside emacs. so please share!

 But if I open or create a jsx file in web-mode, the syntax coloring is horrible.
 If I switch to js2-mode or js-mode, the coloring is just as bad. 
 What are you guys using to make your jsx files readable?

                              <span>I have a small program which is 99% side effect free.
 (https://gitlab.com/john-orford/micrograd/-/blob/master/MoonExample.hs)
 Yesterday, I started running it in GHCI while debugging / testing etc.
 And I noticed, if I don&#x27;t reload before running, it runs and completes almost instantly.
 Unsure how useful this is in the grand scheme of things, but it&#x27;s quite nifty.
 Does GHCI memoise or something?

                              <span>Hi,
 I started to use lxc container for development (to avoid the lot of development library on my host computer.).
 I use it with vscode + remote plugin but sometimes it is freezing / slowing.
 The lxc is running on my laptop so network is not problem.
 I can use console editor inside in the container but with vscode remote seemed okay and very easy setup at the first time.
 I found this slowness when I use git operations, the type info and intellisense working well.
 I was surprised because it is a POC not a big project.
 What is you experience with this configuration ?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been using Scala on the backend for a many years and like many of us, I use Future for concurrency.
 But, I&#x27;m trying to understand why would I use Future in ScalaJS (just started learning) with JS being single threaded.
 One use-case I found is:
 I wrote a test website in ScalaJS with two links using ScalaTags. Each link/page randomly does a heavy computation and then renders a simple but very long HTML. I want to display a spinner when I click on either of the hyperlinks, until the computation ends and the dom is rendered. Without Future, on clicking either of the hyperlinks the page takes a while to update the dom, it kinda halts the browser, and then it renders my big azz ScalaTags HTML. The spinner does not get displayed (I toggle between display &#x3D; none &amp; display &#x3D; block).
 But, when I set the dom to display the spinner in a Future, and then call the render function in another Future for the page clicked using QueueExecutionContext, now, I can see the spinner. 
 Kinda weird! JS is still single threaded so why would the use of Future result in different behavior?
 Does this also mean that I should be using Future whenever I&#x27;m updating the dom?
