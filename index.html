                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using org mode for many years, pretty much since I started using emacs, and for all this time I&#x27;ve kept my notes in a single org file that grows as I add more notes.
 Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I&#x27;m really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).
 I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?
 The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don&#x27;t even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.
 On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.
 I&#x27;m still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m new to both Emacs and Reddit, so bear with me if I&#x27;m not doing this right. I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for note-taking, and I&#x27;m also learning e lisp introduction guide in Emacs, I&#x27;m trying to set up org-indent-mode to enable when I&#x27;m in normal mode and disable when I&#x27;m in insert mode. So I could read my note more clearly.
 I came across a code snippet on EmacsWiki that changes the mode line color based on the Evil state, but I&#x27;m having trouble understanding and adapting it for org-indent-mode. 
 So I wrote this code to achieve this
 (defun escape () &quot;Change org-indent-mode based on evil state&quot; (interactive) (if (evil-normal-state-p) (org-indent-mode 1) (org-indent-mode -1))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;escape) 
 It work when I type M-x escape , I know the problem but i don&#x27;t know to solve it, the problem i think is it is checking for first time and but not observing the change in state.
 I really appreciate any help 💖

 Everytime I press !. Why isn&#x27;t that good enough?
 The local variables list in /home/aswenson/repos/reporting-tools/ or .dir-locals.el contains values that may not be safe (*).
 Do you want to apply it? You can type y -- to apply the local variables list. n -- to ignore the local variables list. ! -- to apply the local variables list, and permanently mark these values () as safe (in the future, they will be set automatically.) i -- to ignore the local variables list, and permanently mark these values () as ignored

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Org for repeating meeting notes for several years. My workflow
 is something like:
  
for each person I regularly meet I have a top level bullet.
 every time I have a meeting with that person, I find the top level bullet, and create a new child bullet, with the date of the meeting and the topic - I have two usual topica, being &quot;catch up&quot; and&quot;review&quot;.
 under that new bullet I type my notes from the meeting. These are usually transcribed from paper notes I make during the meeting.
  
E.g
 * Ann Onymous
 **  catchup
 Ann is having fun working on cold-fusion. Needs new peanut butter and
 mousetraps. Says warm weather is interfering with correct function of
 reverse osmosis proton macerator.
 Needs me to sort out climate and mousetraps.
 **  catchup
 new mousetraps have made life better. Climate still not good enough...
 ​
 Having watched (in bits, over a week or two admiteddly) Prot&#x27;s &#x27;tube explanations, and done a basic installation of Denote, I want to make it work for my note taking needs. I&#x27;m in no way wedded to the arrangement shown above. I&#x27;d happily have a file per person. But I think Denote wants me to have a file per meeting. But for me, a big part of the value is continuity. I.e. being able to see what happened in previous meetings so I can be sure to follow up on actions, and keep a proxixmate record of outstanding actions and conclusions.
 I think this means that I might use Denote by having a file per meeting, with keywords like &quot;talking_to_Ann_Onymous&quot; and then use a dynamic block to gather the rolling textual status. By playing with the frontmatter I could include the date of each meeting. Further, I think I would use the signature fucntions to ensure that the notes are displayed in calendar order.
 Has someone else solved this kind of problem? Did you find a better way to handle this kind of note taking?

 So I&#x27;m setting up evil mode and so far it works pretty well for me. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t really fit what I&#x27;m used to is actions that span multiple lines. The starting and ending lines are not included completely in this action but only from (and on the ending line up to) the position of the cursor. 
 If I had this text ([x] is the cursor position):
  This is[x] a test line Another line to test 
 and then do dj I would end up with this result
  This is line to test 
 I would expect it to just delete both lines. What do I need to configure to get the desired behaviour? The current behaviour is active for all commands that can span multiple lines like yank, delete and so on

                              <span>Title. Some minibuffers under my keyboard-quit to quit minibuffer, some do not. As i see i have 3 options: 1) for each minibuffer mode i use to bind  to minibuffer-keyboard-quit, 2) for each to remap keyboard-quit to minibuffer-keyboard-quit, 3) to remap for all minibuffer modes.
 How can do 3?
  
Also, side question. Why don&#x27;t more packages simply rebind existing (fundamental) functions instead of invent/make us bind new keys?
 I am exploring vertigo/consult (currently ivy/counsel user) and it striked me how friendly transition to vertgo was in terms of keys. I have to learn nothing new, all keys are intuitive. Vertigo simply remaps fundamental functions to vertigo functions. Screenshot - https://imgur.com/a/isc9iYv
 Why don&#x27;t more packages do that?

 Is there a simple clean way to do nested record field update without lens? I wonder when OverloadedRecordDot will start to actually work (without the unwieldy requirement for RebindableSyntax).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using org mode for many years, pretty much since I started using emacs, and for all this time I&#x27;ve kept my notes in a single org file that grows as I add more notes.
 Recently I discovered denote, a young and excellent package to organize notes in files, and I have to say that I&#x27;m really enjoying it. However, it requires me to reorganize my long org file (which is good, after so many years growing out of control).
 I would like to ask, first of all, somebody with similar experiences, why did you decided to switch to denote? Or to stay with a long org file?
 The long org file works for me in a way that I simply come to the file and search for a particular word, so I can easily access all the results and choose the one I want. I don&#x27;t even use tags, everything is organized in sectons using headers. How do you make that search easy in denote? I know that using keywords is the best but, assuming that sometimes you are not even 100% sure about the exact word that you need and you type in a few to try.
 On the other hand, small files work better for my mobile (where I sync my notes), specially with zettel notes app, which has similar organization than denote. However, I wonder if somebody has a good experience with a long org file with some particular app for android.
 I&#x27;m still trying to decide if switching to denote or staying with my long org file. Any comments would be appreciated.

 Any link or repo with samples?

                              <span>I’m wondering if there is some roadmap, or blog posts devoted to the future of the Scala language. I was looking through Rust&#x27;s blog posts and the Rust team does an amazing job describing “what’s next” for the language. In addition to that, there are a lot of blog posts from core language contributors that also give a view on the language evolution which is pretty cool. I could not find any of that for Scala. I read periodically Scala Contributors but it’s more like the discussion of potential improvements and separate proposals. Before 3.3.0 it was stabilization and road to LTS. But now it’s not that clear. 
 It would be nice to have periodical blog posts related to the future of the language and the vision of language designers, a road map that is periodically updated. 
 Not the list of new features (we’re adding this because  has it), but why these features are important, how they will affect language, etc.

                              <span>Background to the problem.
 I use the GUI form designer on Lazarus which saves changes to the form to a text file and in manipulating the form elements, spurious changes are made that I don&#x27;t want.
 For instance if a form is moved around the screen during the edits, the top and left positions of the form are saved to the file even if they are not relevant to the task. Adjusting the size of an element to gain access to some other elements also result in spurios changes.
 Is there some way to revert those changes from the Magit diff view and only commit those desired?
 I know how to stage and commit tht hunks I need but I also need to revert the unwanted uncommitted changes in the working copy.
 Logically I can commit only the changes I want and check the file out again to restore the unwanted changes back to their original setting, but that applies to files containing hunks I have no use for.
 BONUS INFO
 After a bit of searching around I have realized that in addition to Magit there are quite a few package that provide the same functionality, two of those I already have installed.
  
diff-hl
 git-undo
 git-gutter-plus
 git-gutter
  
Searching for stuff is difficult when you don&#x27;t know or can&#x27;t recollect the right terminology. All I had to do was to enter C-h f - hunk and their commands would have showed up.

                              <span>When I upgraded to Emacs 29.2 from 28.2 I was awaken to a rude shock that all my org exports to pdf was broken - after spending many hours to understand why I realised that all my line-breaks were supplied with \\[0pt] instead of the regular \\ - this broke any &#x60;verse&#x60; elements as well as any inline images with &#x60;[[file:...]&#x60; format - the change supposedly was brought in to accommodate a very rare case of triggering a parsing error when using [..] as the first element of a table - which I have never needed to trigger.
 So without any recourse, since the variable is defined using &#x27;defconst&#x60; as opposed to &#x60;defcustom&#x27; and &#x60;setq&#x60; wouldnt work - I had to patch the source in ox-latex.el as

 later I read this thread at the org-mailing list

 ​
 I hope this change is undone as it proved to be a source of my many miseries and many more that will have a rather rude awakening.

                              <span>I have a feeling there must be a package for this kind of thing but I don&#x27;t even know what I would use as a search string and I&#x27;m getting :side-eye from the LLMs atm... 
 There are languages which have CLI tooling to automate the dev+test loop. As an example from Rust there is: 
 cargo watch 
 which will watch the directory for file changes and automatically run tests when a file changes. 
 There are other languages/tools which don&#x27;t have that sort of thing (or for which the tooling is just getting going). As an example, here&#x27;s a much simplified version of what I do in the shell for Terraform: 
 while true; do fsnotifywait -r -e close_write . ; terraform plan &amp;&amp; terraform apply -auto-approve ; sleep 2; done 
 There must be an Emacs package which combines the ability to watch a directory for changes and then automatically execute a pipeline like the above, yes? 
 NOTE: Emacs LSP is fine for fmt and lint in most cases I&#x27;ve encountered. Also, yes, there is better tooling for automated testing in TF now. Like I said, that loop is much simplified.
  
EDIT: Interestingly, here&#x27;s what I eventually managed to get out of an LLM for non-elisp tools perhaps reachable via an Emacs package:

                              <span>One of orgs big strengths is its ability to emit code. I use org-tangle for my literate emacs config, org-export for producing PDFs and HTML, and a variation of org-export MD for producing my Hugo blog posts. But I am unconfident about when org will skip lines. Is my understanding correct?
  
 It seems that timestamps, including inactive timestamps, and DEADLINE and SCHEDULED are ALWAYS output. I wish this weren&#x27;t so.
  When tangling, COMMENT on a heading (shortcut key #) is skipped. I don&#x27;t know if this omits things from org-agenda.
  When marked with :ARCHIVE:, lines are skipped in org-agenda. I use this for optimizing long repeating sequences so that I only have one chunk (month, or school semester) at a time.
  DEADLINES can have their visibility shortened with syntax like ; however, the same seems to break stuff if put into SCHEDULED instead.
 
Traditional syntax commenting with literal &#x3D;# &#x3D; at line start in an org file omits from all of the above, I think. But I&#x27;m not sure.
 Is this as confusing as I see, or is there a unifying principle here?

 its not that much but i am happy to have this today. i have been using emacs for 2 months now but never tried to make it visually appealing. thanks to u/Typical-Win-1132 who suggested me to try svg-tag-mode.
 i still donot know how to do regex properly for svg tag mode. if someone now how to exclude #+title: or #+TITLE: from this regex let me know &quot;\(#\+[A-Za-z0-9#]+:\)&quot;

 Here is the beginning of the README after checking out the emacs-29 branch:

 I know there must be something I&#x27;m doing wrong, but it&#x27;s escaping me. Any suggestions?

 Below are my lsp-mode config and my company config. When I use lsp mode with pyright on python files I get completions almost immediately upon typing. There is virtually no delay that I can even notice but when I use lsp mode with rust-analyzer on a rust file, the completion never pops up no matter what I do. I have tried reinstalling rust-analyzer, restarting lsp-mode, restarting company mode and nothing changes. Anybody had experience with this before? I couldn&#x27;t find anything online about this and even saw a few tutorials about how to setup rust with lsp mode and they all had completion with company.

 Currently I have all my case classes and functions, and main in an object file, which is src&gt;main&gt;scala&gt;example&gt;main.scala
 I put the CSVs i’m working with under src&gt;main&gt;resources
 How do i organize my code? Am i supposed to put my case classes functions in another object file? Would be great to know your thoughts on this

                              <span>/u/viercc just posted this fantastic code and I had to share. It lets you 1. generically1 define a polynomial interface to your type and 2. use it to derive Applicative and Monad:

 I have dabbled both with Haskell and abstract algebra and I’m wondering if there’s a relationship? If there is could you please send me any links to information I can use to learn about this? Thanks

A look under GHC’s hood: desugaring linear types by Arnaud Spiwack
I thought I’d take the opportunity to discuss some of GHC’s inner workings and how they explain some of the features of linear types in Haskell. We’ll be discussing a frequently asked question: why can’t Ur be a newtype? And some new questions such as: why must linear let-bindings have a !?

                              <span>I am using Doom Emacs.
 I have all my projects under ~/Documents/projects. In Emacs I ran projectile-discover-projects-in-directory and then in the input (not sure what Emacs people call it?) I entered the path ~/Documents/projects, the first time I ran it, it actually did something, took about 10 seconds. It probably indexed those projects. But if I try to switch projects, no projects show.
 I&#x27;m still quite new to Emacs, so I attempted to run the function in my config.
 (setq org-directory &quot;~/org/&quot; projectile-project-search-path &#x27;(&quot;~/Documents/projects/&quot;)) 
 But it also doesn&#x27;t work...
 As I said, still quite new to Emacs, so I don&#x27;t know how to check for Error messages, the *Messages* buffer is empty tho.
 ​
 Edit: Projects are all git repos.

                              <span>Guys hi!
 What i want to achieve is to have main font for buffer around height 11-12, and org tables height 10.
 Problem right now org table face seem to take minimal line height from main font seize disregarding their font size. So they are a bit heigher than they should be.
 Screenshots:
 main font 10, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/hntoqNS (rows are ideal height)
 main font 10.5, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/qvxOeI9 (rows are a bit heigher than optimal)
 main font 30, org table face 10 https://imgur.com/a/8u3PAWL (rows ... you can tell :) there is no extra linese here - it&#x27;s a 3 row table)
 Is this how it supposed to work, or did i mess something up? I swear before update to emacs 29 / org 9.6.6 rows had line height 10 (not 10.5) with my normal set up of main font 10.5. But maybe it was always like this...

 When developing React projects, I often stumble over something called &quot;Styled Components&quot;, which are altered ReactJS components with CSS applied to it. It looks like this:
 export const AssetColumnHeader &#x3D; styled(Div)&#x60; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: flex-start; font-family: ${({ theme }) &#x3D;&gt; theme.fonts.primary}; color: ${({ theme }) &#x3D;&gt; theme.colors[theme.textColors.primary.color][ theme.textColors.primary.intensity ]}; strong { font-weight: 600; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; } &#x60;; 
 My major mode is typescript-ts-mode.
 I&#x27;d like to have &quot;css-ts-mode&quot; inside the space delimited by &#x60;...&#x60; (backticks). With the exception of ${ ... }, which is Javascript/Typescript (also typescript-ts-mode).

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m relatively new to Emacs (28) and spent the holidays configuring it to be a nice environment for machine learning applications and writing Latex/org-mode markup. Loving it so far.
 However, one thing I wish I could change is the major modes for C, C++, Python, and Shell languages. I tend to get really overwhelmed by how many options are provided because of the maturity of these languages and it&#x27;s hard for me to really learn their features even with which-key installed. Another sticking point is that they sometimes overwrite custom keybinds that I use frequently, especially c-mode.
 Is there such a thing as a general purpose coding major mode that just provides syntax highlighting with tree-sitter, code folding, and Eldoc info for each language? Maybe this is something that would be easy to hack up by extending prog-mode with only those features?
 Barring that, is there a way to help simplify the major modes like not overriding my global keymap? I have a difficult time with mental context switching and want to only need to think about my basic keybinds and org stuff.

                              <span>I often find myself working with two (or more) buffers open in Emacs: actively writing in one while needing to search in the other.Is there a way to search in the secondary buffer without moving the cursor from the primary buffer? I&#x27;ve tried multi-isearch-buffers, but it doesn&#x27;t search when I press RET, seems buggy.
 My current method is:
  
Switch to the second buffer.
 Perform an I-search.
 Switch back to the first buffer to continue writing.
 Repeat as needed.
  
This workflow feels cumbersome. Does anyone have suggestions for a more efficient approach?

 Saving and killing the buffer test.txt, and reopening it causes the error:

Turning on toggle-debug-on-error does not produce a backtrace.
 is it not possible to store strings with newlines as the values of file-local variables? The elisp manual makes no mention of this limitation in the file-local vars section -- perhaps I missed something?

                              <span>okay reddit I have been using Emacs for a bit both on Linux and windows and I have never seen anything like this happen. I just pulled my config from git hub as I had to rest my PC R.I.P. These warnings seem to have to do with the packages themselves and not my config. Does anyone know what is happening. If more info is needed please let me know!

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m having trouble installing lsp-java on Mac. Installing the package itself is easy; however, installing the &#x60;jdtls&#x60; lsp is proving to be difficult. 
 Since it is on a work laptop, I cannot provide log messages. My first issue was when the script that LSP runs to install jdtls failed to install due to cert issues. I was able to fix those, but I ran into error &#x60;java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty&#x60;. I tried fixing the cert store, but no luck.
 The next thing I tried was doing &#x60;brew install jdtls&#x60;. I tried setting &#x60;lsp-java-server-install-dir&#x60; to the install location of the jdtls binary; however, that also did not work. For some reason, LSP cannot find the &#x60;jdtls&#x60; in my path, even though it&#x27;s available globally on my system. FWIW, I am using package exec-path-from-shell, and it&#x27;s properly configured (other packages that depend on external tools work just fine). 
 I was wondering if anyone has had any luck getting lsp-java to work on Mac, especially if you went the &#x60;brew install jdtls&#x60; route. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Is there a way search by a string and mass-edit the result?
 This functionality sounds like it overlaps with query-replace but I want the ability to see a uniq-ed search result in a buffer, make modifications to that buffer and have the result be applied to the original text.
 Given an org file I include a header as a sub-header to create a reference to it. There are variations between the sub-headers but they all include the the same ID I can search by.

 Installation
 Use the Melpa Emacs Lisp archive to install this as a regular package:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (package-install &#x27;ert-results)
 (require &#x27;ert-results) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 or install it directly from the Github archive above as it is a single file code library.
 ert-results.el Rationale
 Within an interactive Emacs session, if ert is called with a regular expression selector argument that matches to multiple test names, all such tests are run, but only a summary line of output is displayed for all passing tests. Thus, the names of the passing matched tests are not displayed. Presently, within the ert output buffer, you must press {j} on each individual test summary result to display and jump to the test name and have its status spelled out.
 This package solves those problems by adding new contex…</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I want to write some rules representing rewrites for s-expressions:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data Pattern &#x3D; Var String | Fn String [Pattern]
 data Rule &#x3D; Rule Pattern Pattern
 -- (f ?a 1) &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; (g ?a) rule &#x3D; Rule (Fn &quot;f&quot; [Var &quot;a&quot;, Fn &quot;1&quot; []]) (Fn &quot;g&quot; [Var &quot;a&quot;]) -- Invalid rule: (f ?a 1) &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; (g ?b) invalidRule &#x3D; Rule (Fn &quot;f&quot; [Var &quot;a&quot;, Fn &quot;1&quot; []]) (Fn &quot;g&quot; [Var &quot;b&quot;]) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Informally, if an expressions &quot;matches&quot; the LHS, this binds each pattern variable to an expression, and then we substitute these into the RHS.
 The problem is that this representation doesn&#x27;t prevent me from writing invalid rules. In particular, I&#x27;d like to prevent variable binding issues: I&#x27;d like to enforce that all pattern variables that appear on the right hand side must appear on the left hand side. (It&#x27;s fine for variables to appear multiple times in a pattern.) Is there a way to do this? Maybe with some HOAS approach?

                              <span>Hi everyone, i’m new to Scala and I’m trying to perform data analysis on a bunch of CSVs with Scala but with an emphasis on functional programming. i’m wondering when it comes to data analysis, is it possible to perform transformations on datasets without using Spark functions like .WithColumn .groupBy etc? If not, does using these type of functions count as Spark SQL? Or just using the Spark API for scala?

                              <span>I have been religiously working on a migration from Play 2.12 to 2.13 and since Play iteratees are no longer available in 2.13 I used Akka streaming. Somehow after a lot of effort, I made it work but then I was looking at this article: https://www.lightbend.com/akka/license-faq which made my heart skip a beat. Since Akka had super powerful capabilities, especially for concurrent apps is this end for scala? Are the older functionalities like Akka streaming and all still under Apache 2.0 or they would also be affected by this? Any alternatives for all this?
 I know what Akka is requesting makes sense but I can&#x27;t convince my business owners to get one license. They are instead insisting me to migrate to some other microservice or framework. :/

                              <span>Hi Zettlers,
I am creating a growing list of the benefits of the Zettelkasten Method. This is in itself neither new nor exciting, since it would be a repetition of the marketing babble already existing in the domain of knowledge management.
My take will be to highlight the steps of the causal mechanism how the benefit is created. There is a lot of talk about that the Zettelkasten gives you a certain set of benefits, sometimes a blurry idea of the how. There is a lack of explicitness and precision. This is what I am going for.
So, my request is for you: Give me every benefit you can think of. Being it a benefit that you want to be justified or rejected. Being it a benefit that you experienced. Being a benefit that other&#x27;s claim and you are not sure about.
GIVE ME EVERYTHING!</span>

                              <span>Hey fellow Haskellers,
 I hope you&#x27;re all doing well. I&#x27;m currently a chemical engineer working in scientific software development, and from a couple of months ago I&#x27;ve been diving into Haskell. It sparkled the desire to eventually transition to a job where I can use this fantastic language on a daily basis.
 I&#x27;ve gone through a few Haskell books and even tackled some challenges like Advent of Code 2023, which was a great experience. However, as I start thinking about applying Haskell to real-world problems, I find myself lacking the confidence I need to navigate the complexities that may arise.
 For those of you who have made a similar learning journey or have experience working with Haskell professionally, I&#x27;d love to hear your advice on how to bridge the gap from solving algorithmic challenges to confidently handling real-world projects. Are there specific resources, projects, or practices that you found particularly helpful in your journey?
 I appreciate any words of wisdom you can share with me as I go on this exciting but challenging journey. Thanks in advance for your support!

 APL or the newer BQN seem perfect for a QuasiQuotes DSL.

                              <span>EDIT: This has now been solved, see https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-wlroots-bindings/8426/45.
 (This is a repost of a Discourse post in the hopes of getting more responses. This issue is actively impacting my ability to maintain wlhs, so I would appreciate any ideas!)
 For the past few weeks, I and others have been developing wlhs, a set of Haskell bindings to libwayland and wlroots. For the most part, development on my side has run fairly smoothly.
 However, when I tried to build wlhs two days ago, I received the following error:
 $ cabal build Resolving dependencies... Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies: [__0] next goal: wlhs-bindings (user goal) [__0] rejecting: wlhs-bindings-0.1.0 (conflict: pkg-config package wayland-server-any, not found in the pkg-config database) [__0] fail (backjumping, conflict set: wlhs-bindings) After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I&#x27;ve had most trouble fulfilling: wlhs-bindings 
 Despite the error message saying that wayland-server is ‘not found in the pkg-config database’, it clearly is present on my system:
 $ pkg-config --modversion wayland-server 1.22.0 
 What makes this strange is how suddenly it stopped working. Two days ago, I couldn’t build wlhs; the day before, I could. (Or at least, I have no memory of it failing before that.) Does anyone have any ideas around how to fix this problem?
 For reference, I’m using pkgconf-2.1.0. (Installed on December 7, so that hasn’t changed recently.) I have also tested several Cabal versions: it fails with 3.10.2.1 and 3.10.1.0, as well as current HEAD. It does succeed with cabal-3.6.2.0, but that version is unusable for me as it can’t handle my custom Setup.hs. I’m running EndeavourOS, which is a variant of Arch Linux.

 I am in constant search of prettifying my emacs setup and I need some inspiration from all of you.
 Show us your eye candy emacs with associated plugins and configuration tricks so others like me can get inspired.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I have a config for which-key in my keybindings, intended to show a minibuffer when hitting the  + . For example:
 (use-package general :config (general-evil-setup) (general-create-definer felipe/leader-keys :states &#x27;(normal insert emacs) :keymaps &#x27;override :prefix &quot;SPC&quot; :global-prefix &quot;M-SPC&quot;) (felipe/leader-keys &quot;b&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;buffer&quot;) ... &quot;b p&quot; &#x27;(previous-buffer :wk &quot;Previous buffer&quot;)) 
 When I run (SPC + &quot;b p&quot;) the command works just fine (as all the others combinations of b + ...)
 However, when I hit only (SPC + b) It does nothing, and I get the following message:
 Error running timer &#x27;which-key--update&#x27;: (void-function-which-key-order-alpha) 
 I already tried updating the package via elpaca-manager (elpaca is my pkg manager) but It seems to bu already up to date.
 Does anyone know how to solve this issue?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

                              <span>I am using Emacs 28 on Unbutu 23.04 and contemplating migrating to 29. I am a little cautious here because emacs is my main tool, which I use 9+ hours daily and very much depend upon. Hence, a few questions:
  
Should I expect package incompatibility? I am using a lot of MELPA packages!
 What version better to use? From PPA or Snap?
 Both repositories offer 29.1, not 29.2. Should I wait for 29.2?
 What is the easiest way to migrate all my installed packages?
  
Any other migration hints and warnings are greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been taking notes with org-roam for a while and recently found out about denote. I like the idea of not being completely dependent on org-mode and keeping things simple by storing the metadata in filenames instead of relying on an sql database. I&#x27;m considering giving it a go, but converting my notes and porting the custom stuff I made for roam over the years would take considerable effort. Problem is, that the implementation being more elegant, doesn&#x27;t necessarily make something more useful in practice. Can someone who used both roam and denote give me a practical sales pitch?

                              <span>I am looking for advice on how to handle use cases where a repeating task has to be temporarily rescheduled and then reset back to its normal timestamp. 
 For example, say I have a repeating task that occurs once a month on the 17th. A month comes up where I need to reschedule this task to the 18th. Once the task is complete, I then have to remember that it usually occurs on the 17th and manually set it back to that date. 
 A similar issue comes up when I have to change just the time of day of daily task while organizing my day. I then have to remember to change the date back at the end of the day. 
 Manually resetting daily tasks back to their normal time of day is a particularly tedious chore, because I have quite a few of them and their times are fairly intricate. 
 Is there a less manual way to handle these use cases? Ideally, I would like the tasks to be set back to their normal time slots automatically.

                              <span>Hi,
 it&#x27;s a bit of an open-ended question I guess.
 Is this just me or org feels very unfriendly to build on top of? Is there a public API I could use to perform some org-related actions?
 Example:
 I don&#x27;t like the way todo items in the agenda are displayed and the configuration is pretty poor (I believe you can only configure the prefix and even that isn&#x27;t that powerful). So I figured I should just write my own view for todo items. Well, I couldnt find any documentation for that. I figured the only way is to go through the source code (which is a huge blob of a file that I&#x27;m not sure how to navigate efficiently) and hack my way into it (which may end up being incompatible with future versionsk break features, etc)
 Another example:
 I&#x27;d like to collect some data across all my org files. I don&#x27;t see any &quot;org&quot; way to grab all my files, convert them to some sort of objects, and grab some data I need. The closest I found is the Element API which seems to do with parsing org files and I&#x27;m not even sure that&#x27;s an official package.

                              <span>I&#x27;m starting to use column view, and one thing I&#x27;d like to see is a column showing when any given captured item was created. Any ideas how to do this? 
 FWIW, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried so far.
 I had hoped that the Special Property, TIMESTAMP_IA would give me what I&#x27;m after, but I can&#x27;t get that to work. So far I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Relying on the fact that I usually clock-in when capturing, and so the datum I want is almost always already there for me, in the form of the start time for the earliest clock entry. But TIMESTAMP_IA appears to ignore timestamps that are part of clock entries. So this is no use.
 Having my capture templates create a property drawer into which gets inserted a new property called CREATED, with value of %u. That does allow me to see the value in column view, but it is under %CREATED, not under %TIMESTAMP_IA.
 Same as #3, but instead of having the CREATED property inserted into the property drawer, insert it into my logbook drawer. That does let me see the value under %TIMESTAMP_IA but bizarrely it then does not display it under %CREATED. 
  
So either #2 or #3 could work, but I consider them to be non-ideal. 
 With #2, I don&#x27;t get to use the built-inTIMESTAMP_IA which I get the feeling is really intended for the kind of thing I&#x27;m trying to do. 
 And while with #3, I do get to use TIMESTAMP_IA, it is at the expense of having to insert my CREATED property into a non-property drawer, which something in the back of my mind says is ill-advised. 
 And of course with both #2 and #3, unnecessary duplication is involved since, as I said, the date I want is already staring me in the face in the starting stamp of the first clock entry. Having to go around creating properties for the sole purpose of duplicating and making available an otherwise unavailable variable is, well, naff.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been writing Scala for quite a while now. I originally started out with Monix and later switched to ZIO, but lately I&#x27;ve been enjoying plain Scala a lot more, especially since Virtual Threads have become stable.
 I&#x27;m just curious if anyone else has made a similar transition.

                              <span>CE 3 provides a Queue class out of box. But it&#x27;s not in CE2. 
 So which one should I use for best practice? The goal is to be concurrency-safe when multiple producers and consumers talk with it concurrently.
 The tutorial points to SimpleConcurrentQueue as a &quot;reference&quot; for learning purpose. Is it robust?

                              <span>Software developers increasingly adopt the microservices architecture, a server-side solution where interconnected services function autonomously. This enables distinct teams to work on separate services without interrupting the overall workflow—a level of flexibility rarely seen in alternative architectural approaches. Additionally, the next generation approach—multi-runtime architecture—is gaining more attention. In this blog post, we explain both concepts, as well as their benefits and limitations compared to the monolithic architecture.</span>

 I have the following data types for:
 data Exp &#x3D; Num Int | Plus Exp Exp
 data SExp &#x3D; Atom Type | L [SExp]
 And I want a function that does the following:
 parse :: SExp -&gt; Exp 
 parse (Atom s) &#x3D; if typeOf s &#x3D;&#x3D; Int then Num s else _
 I understand the existing of function typeOf. But is there a way to do this equality without passing an actual value (i.e. typeOf s &#x3D;&#x3D; typeOf 1 or typeOf s &#x3D;&#x3D; typeOf &#x27;c&#x27;). Things that come to mind, but don&#x27;t know how to implement, is to use type families since one can they map types to types. Apologies in advance for any nonsensical things on this post.

                              <span>Recently I realized an analogy that helped me - That the way Haskell does IO is the same way React does UI. Instead of doing the IO (or building the UI), we instead write a program that generates the program that does the IO (or builds the UI).
 Writing it down this way makes it sound fancy and meta, but it&#x27;s a simple, almost obvious, connection really, maybe I&#x27;m not using the right words. I also tried doing a longer exposition on this here (there I also show how React, SwiftUI and Flutter have the same gene).

                              <span>I plan to work on a series of demos of more complicated LLM-based editing with Emacs, either more complicated because the interactions are more complicated, or because they just require a bit more complicated types of processing.
 The first is a demo of asking an LLM to improve text. The ellama package already does this, but what this adds is the ability to see a diff, ask for further changes (in context of the previous changes) and accept the diff.
 My goal is to produce a bunch of these demos and figure out the necessary library functions to do these things in a clean, consistent, and useful way. Perhaps I&#x27;d add them to the &#x60;llm&#x60; package, perhaps it might require a new package. In emacs-devel@ I wrote up details, including code pointers and a list of interesting questions I&#x27;m thinking about. I&#x27;m posting this here as well because I think there&#x27;s interest on what I&#x27;m demoing, and I&#x27;d appreciate feedback on it, especially from a user perspective.

                              <span>Guys hi
 Currently my emacs setup for python is python-mode + eglot + pyright. I am satisfied with it :) except for debugging.
 What to should i add/configure to be able to examine values of variables/functions when running my scripts?
 Now when something goes wrong, i add lots of print statements... Obviously it&#x27;s not right. I tried pdb, set_trace - it&#x27;s better than print. But is there a better way?
 To run my scripts i simply do M-x run python and enter what i want to run. (i also use python-mls)

                              <span>I wanted to set different fonts for different languages, which I did nicely with set-fontset-font. But when I try to extend this requirement to daemon, I run into difficulties.
 At first, I used the following code:
 (set-fontset-font &quot;fontset-startup&quot; &#x27;latin (font-spec :family &quot;Noto Sans Mono&quot; :size 24))
 I start Emacs by typing Emacs in the terminal, and it worked fine.
 But when I run emacs --daemon, it gives me the following error:
 error: Fontset ‘fontset-startup’ does not exist
 So I tried to set fonset-default. but strangely, the fonts I set for latin are always overwritten (whereas the fonts I set for han don&#x27;t have this problem).
 I know I can set fonts using set-face-attribute etc, but they can&#x27;t set multiple fonts like fontset can. So I decided to come to Reddit to try and ask for help after I couldn&#x27;t find a solution that worked for me in Google.
 Also attached is my runtime environment:
  
KDE Plasma 5.27.10 with wayland(kwin)
 Emacs 29.1
  
Remind me if you need more information from me!
 Thanks!

 In Markdouwn 4 spaces means verbatim block,
 In RST any indentation means verbatim block or quotation or else.

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m trying to connect Gnus to my server. I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful at following the emacswiki Gnus Tutorial.
 It gives me an error message (which has some information, before I was getting Error in ~/.gnus: ) which was much less helpful. The error is:
 Error in ~/.gnus: smtpmail-smtp-server In my .gnus file, it&#x27;s exactly as provided by my email provider. My .gnus is as follows:
 \ &#x60;&#x60;(setq user-mail-address &quot;name@address&quot; ; $EMAIL&#x60; &#x60;user-full-name &quot;Name Name&quot; ; $NAME&#x60; &#x60;smtpmail-smtp-server &quot;mail.server.com&quot; ; $SMTPSERVER&#x60; &#x60;send-mail-function &#x27;smtpmail-send-it ;&#x60; &#x60;smtpmail-smtp-service 465 ; SMTP por&#x60; &#x60;t gnus-select-method &#x27;(nntp &quot;foo.bar.com&quot;)) ; Connect to an NNTP server&#x60; &#x60;;; A list of additional servers (&#x60; &#x60;add-to-list gnus-secondary-select-methods &#x27;((nnspool &quot;localhost&quot;) (nnml &quot;&quot;)))&#x60; &#x60;;; nnml gets credentials here. (setq mail-sources &#x27;((imap :server &quot;mail.server.com&quot;&#x60; &#x60;:user &quot;name@address&quot;))&#x60;\&#x60; 
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on with it? I&#x27;ve been busting some sweat over it for the past 3 hours |:
 Regards.
 Edit: I&#x27;ve been able to get the rmail client in Emacs (M-x mail) to send mail but am having trouble configuring the .gnus file.
 Second edit: I&#x27;ve reached a solution. I ended up simplifying my .gnu file to only contain my mail address, name, smtp default server, and the port.

Our domain is your typical ecommerce ecosystem with our entities defined as things you would expect (e.g product, order, shipment).
 Lagom is approaching EOL on July 1, 2024. Therefore, we are looking for some alternatives that we can potentially migrate to. Lightbend suggest to use Kalix or pure Akka. However with the recent changes to their licensing we perhaps do not want to tightly couple ourselves to Lightbend products going forward.
 There&#x27;s a million questions I could ask here but I guess the most pertinent one is at a high level/first steps, how should our team approach this? Here are some thoughts I …</span>

                              <span>I would like Org mode to behave like outline-mode with reveal-mode (a minor mode) turned on. That is, when I move into hidden text (shown by an ellipses), all such text is auto-expanded. Then when point moves out of a node that was auto-expanded, it collapses back to the way it was.
 I know org-fold has all sorts of context exposure capability and settings but I can&#x27;t seem to get any behavior like this from looking at the documentation. I want simple, automatic behavior. Yes, it is okay if it just expands all levels drawers, etc. that are hidden based on movement of point.
 Even better would be if Org mode were made compatible with reveal.el. Then one could simply enable the global version of that minor mode and have this behavior in all of your org files, as exists now for other outlining modes.

 One thing I&#x27;ve really struggled with on iOS is syncing org files. It was super easy on Android. Any tips wrt syncing?

                              <span>My Zettelkasten now follows the TROLL  system. The backronym stands for
Tortuous Repository of Labyrinthine Lucubration
This isn&#x27;t advocacy--it&#x27;s an attempt to describe what my Zettelkasten has become so far, or rather, what it can and cannot do. It seems impervious to market forces and cannot interact with them. It wants to negate virtually every front-page headline in the paper of record and other carefully edited organs of filtered pablum. Other than that, there is no interaction. Attempts to optimize it only make it worse and more convoluted than otherwise. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a wellspring of ideas--more like a trapped aquifer.
This seems to have happened after switching ID formats at least twice and adding an alphabetic backlink index. Any effort to describe it is at least as long as the Zettelkasten itself.</span>

                              <span>Is anyone familiar with the current state of XML parsing, processing and querying libraries in Haskell?
 Every few years I have the need to parse XML, I find that the top results on Google when I search for Haskell libraries to deal with XML are packages that have not been updated in a while, and the situation never improves.
 This is hard, so I&#x27;m not surprised that some authors have given up on updating their libraries. But XML is still widely used.
 I would not mind it if there was some coordinated effort towards cleaning and updating of XML libraries.

                              <span>Hi, feel free to guide me out but I have a strong feeling Haskellers already have this figured out.
 I&#x27;m a python programmer coming from research background. I fell in love with programming and functional programming always had this allure for me. I have read quite a bit on functional programming, Bartoz Milewskis &quot;Category theory for programmers&quot; and doing the haskell.mooc.fi
 To learn the things actually, I started writing a simplified version of card game Dominion with python and trying to use pseudo-Haskell approach. Why? I&#x27;m more fluent in python for now (especially IO) and a game like Dominion is inherently stateful so I thought this would be a good practice.
 I have record (dataclass in python) called playerState which contains deck, hand, discarcd_pile i.e. things that model individual player. For now, I have a gameState that contains a list of playerStates and central_supply that is global for all players.
 All card effects are pure, often partial functions effect::playerState, someArg-&gt;playerState. For example draw::playerState -&gt; num_cards -&gt; playerState. Here is an example of a card that draws one card and gains one card: gainDraw &#x3D; Card( name&#x3D;&quot;Gain Victory point and draw 1 card&quot;, card_type&#x3D;&quot;Action&quot;, cost&#x3D;2, effects&#x3D;[gain victoryCard, draw 1], ). Now the &quot;cool part&quot; is that I have a function play_card:: playerState -&gt; Card -&gt; playerState that simply composes all effects of a card to one single composite function and applies it to playerState. Playing one card is then one elegant transition from state1 to state2 with no intermediary assigments etc. So far so good.
 Now the problem: some card effects modify also the global gameState and not just fields in playerState. Essentially I have globalState containing localStates. What is a common solution in Haskell or in functional paradigm in general to handle nested states? A whole different architecture, lifting types? You can be harsh and say that my domain(ion, sorry had to) modeling is all wrong.

                              <span>Just shared on an old post how you can &quot;coordinate&quot; use-package and package-selected-packages so that you may, for example, use package-autoremove.
 That post is 3 years old, so posing also as a new entry in case it&#x27;s useful to anybody (and to gather feedback):
 This creates a new keyword extension for use-package, :mark-selected t:
 &#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp ;;;; use-package :mark-selected ;; Make it possible to kinda managepackage-selected-packages&#x27; from ;; use-package by adding &#x60;:mark-selected&#x27; as a keyword.. (require &#x27;use-package) (defun use-package-normalize/:mark-selected (_name keyword args) (use-package-only-one (symbol-name keyword) args #&#x27;(lambda (_label arg) (or arg nil))))
 (defun use-package-handler/:mark-selected (name _keyword arg rest state) (let ((body (use-package-process-keywords name rest state))) (if arg (package--update-selected-packages &#x60;(,name) &#x27;())) body))
 (add-to-list &#x27;use-package-keywords :mark-selected t) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 You can then do:
 emacs-lisp (use-package no-littering :mark-selected t :config (no-littering-theme-backups) (setq custom-file (no-littering-expand-etc-file-name &quot;custom.el&quot;))) 
 And your package-selected-packages will have this package!

                              <span>I have the habit to want to exit read only bufers such as Gnus or Elfeed with q.
 I noticed that (almost) all &quot;special&quot; modes derive from special-mode which provide such a key-bind among others.
 So I defined a minor mode to reuse these keybinds in read-only-mode:
 https://gitlab.com/Thaodan/emacs.d-lisp/-/blob/master/simple-ext.el?ref_type&#x3D;heads#L14
 The mode can be activated similar to other minor modes like shown below (when using use-package).
  (use-package read-only :init (require &#x27;simple-ext) :hook ((read-only-mode . special-keymap-mode))) 
 The mode made is much more convenient for me to work with files which are read-only.

                              <span>New to Emacs and building my own configuration from scratch. I am impressed with the approach used in the rougier/nano-emacs and would like to implement. 
 The readme is easy enough to follow, but the existence of more recent repos for individual submodules has me second guessing myself. The following repos have been updated more recently than rougier/nano-emacs: 
  
 rougier/nano-modeline
 rougier/nano-agenda
 rougier/nano-vertico
  
This leaves me wondering, for example, whether I should be using nano-modeline.el from rougier/nano-emacs (last updated three years ago), or from the rougier/nano-modeline (last updated yesterday) . 
 ​
 For those that use nano-emacs, what is the approach you recommend?

 Personally, huge pre-configured solutions (like lazyvim or spacemacs) are too complicated for me. As a beginner, I want to do things at a relatively raw level, which is more comfortable because I don&#x27;t feel blindly accepting things where I often confuse different parts and keep doing things the wrong way, and that blindness in my experience often prevents me from using a tool in the most efficient way (plus spacemacs&#x27; startup time is too long :( on my already not so powerful computer).
 So I liked it once I found the repo of Ashton. I tried the simplest version from the repository (called &quot;early-init.el&quot;) and followed its comments carefully. Useful things I found in this file include
  
how to install packages
 how to change the background colour (I didn&#x27;t do though)
 Others like font face where the repository owner left it blank, but the related function names are there to guide me.
  
​
 --------
 Totally unrelated, the Emacs plugins have a very different flavour compared to their counterparts in Neovim/vim. They are structured quite differently. This is how I feel as someone who has tried to learn Vim for a while. (The latter&#x27;s approach requires a degree of understanding of &quot;the editor itself&quot; such text object)

 I am curious about send text to vterm from a SQL buffer or python buffer, trying to emulate the behaviour of send text to inf-python
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Apologies if this is the wrong place for this. There is no beorg subreddit, and I can only image that this is the only place on reddit where there would be a decent number of beorg users.
 I have had some issues on beorg when it comes to connecting to my NAS server via WebDAV so I can sync with my .org files on there. No matter what I do, it seems, I get the following error message:
 &#x27;Sync could not be completed. A list of your files couldn&#x27;t be downloaded from your server. Check that your WebDAV server URL, username and password are correct.&#x27;
 I have entered the URL, username, and password correctly, as I have been able to connect using other devices and services. I am confident this is not the issue.
 Some of the (log-contents) mention an SSL error, so I thought the issue might be with the certificate. But since I have managed to use WebDAV with other devices and services, and since I have tried logging in while toggling the &#x27;Allow untrusted certificate&#x27;, I am not so sure it is a certificate issue.
 I have tried every kind of URL, folder path, and I just can&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t working. The settings on my NAS don&#x27;t seem to be the issue either. I have gone over them, and, as mentioned, managed to connect with many other devices and services.
 My usual URL is something like this:
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav
 I have also tried the following:
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/webdav/[path to my .org folder]
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me/dav/[path to my .org folder]
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5006
 https://[DDNS hostname].synology.me:5005
 I have tried using http and smb as well. I have also tried using NAS quick connect and using the external IP address of the NAS. Port-forwarding is correctly configured on my router.
 I just can&#x27;t hack it.
 Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated! Thanks!

Will I be arrested if I put all my emacs tutorial links in one big .org file rather than using atomic notes? Should I be cross-pollinating my coding knowledge base with my cooking recipes?</summary>

                              <span>Hey there, I&#x27;m experimenting more with Org-roam and am trying to figure out some of the best practices before committing too much on one path. Currently, I&#x27;ve set up a few bigger .org files such as emacs and orgmode that link to each other, but in each I have a bunch of useful links. I&#x27;ve seen some tutorials suggesting that links and thoughts should be in very small individual .org files, but that seems convoluted and time-consuming. 
 Secondly, I&#x27;m wondering how much info I really want to add from areas that might not be so related. Do I really want to mesh together my cooking knowledge base with my computer focused information pools? Will things get convoluted down the line?
 I&#x27;ve been having a little trouble finding actual workflows. A lot of tutorials on setting things up, but I&#x27;d like to see more of Org-roam in action. I think I&#x27;m missing some of the bigger picture philosophy in relation to org-mode.
 How do you all use it? Do you have any useful media I can read or watch?
 Thanks for your time!

                              <span>I have a function that I use inside of a larger function to list all org-roam notes with the &quot;Project&quot; tag. These functions are defined in a .el file that is called from my init.el file. For some reason, when I eval the defun blocks in that file, the function fails to recognize the argument I pass to it (&quot;tagname&quot;), but when I copy the code into my scratch buffer and evaluate it there, it suddenly works. I am also able to add the line (defvar tagline &quot;Project&quot;) and it works in that case as well.
 (defun cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag (tagname) (lambda (node) (member tagname (org-roam-node-tags node)))) (defun cj/org-roam-find-project () (interactive) ;; Select file to open, creating if necessary (org-roam-node-find nil nil (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag &quot;Project&quot;) nil :templates &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;project&quot; plain &quot;* Goal\n\n%?\n\n* Inbox\n\n** TODO Add initial tasks\n\n&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n#+category: ${title}\n#+filetags: Project&quot;) :unnarrowed t)))) 
 Essentially, the issue I&#x27;m having is I start emacs/load my init file, these functions are defined, and I run cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag. I get the error (void-variable tagname), which seems to come from the lambda function. At this point, if I run (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag &quot;Project&quot;), it evaluates to (lambda (node) (member tagname (progn (or ... ...) (aref node 16)))), which I can then fix be either copying the (cj/org-roam-filter-by-tag) function to the scratch buffer and evaluating it there, or evaluating (defvar tagname &quot;Project&quot;). 
 This code is taken almost exclusively from system crafters, and I don&#x27;t really understand the lambda function and what it does. As far as I can tell this seems to be some sort of scoping issue, but since I&#x27;m directly calling the function with &quot;Project&quot; as an argument, I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;m getting the &quot;void-variable&quot; error. 
 I&#x27;m a little lost with this issue, and I&#x27;d appreciate any help. Thanks!

                              <span>As the title says, is it possible to use emacs-jupyter with Databricks?
 A typical workflow for me involves writing a conversational-style org file in Emacs as I puzzle through how to get the data I need out of Databricks tables in an accompanying browser window:
  
Issue Spark SQL query in browser window.
 Download result set as CSV.
 Open CSV file in Emacs.
 Save the entire file contents to the kill ring.
 Paste it into my org file.
 Select the table and run org-table-create-or-convert-from-region (C-c |).
  
I could streamline steps 3-6 with a homebrew command, but I am aching to do this kind of exploration org-babel style, just pressing C-c C-c to run the query and seeing the results right there in the org file.
 The emacs-jupyter Github page mentions a command jupyter-connect-repl which connects to an existing kernel, which seems to be what I&#x27;d need, if, as I suppose, a notebook I run on the Databricks web interface is backed by a kernel. (Although I don&#x27;t know for sure; introductory-level descriptions of the various components seems to be pretty scarce.) The Github page links to something called a kernel&#x27;s connection file, a JSON file with fields like control_port, shell_port, etc, which I would need to supply. I&#x27;ve scoured the Databricks notebook interface and can&#x27;t find a file like this offered anywhere. There is a tab called &quot;Partner Connect&quot; that offers &quot;connection files&quot; for many Databricks partner companies, but the ones I&#x27;m able to access don&#x27;t contain the information emacs-jupyter seems to want. Some aren&#x27;t even JSON.
 So, yeah. Any advice?

                              <span>I want to define a project specific menu (or keybindings) of commands.
 For example, in the context of /home/user/my-project1, I want to setup this menu:
  t: Execute specific command 1.  r: Execute specific command 2.  k: Execute specific command 3. 
 In /home/user/my-project2, I want this other menu:
  a: Execute specific command 4.  b: Execute specific command 5.  h: Execute specific command 5. 
 I am flexible on the details. The only requirement is that this menu is configurable and specific to a given project. This menu should contain only the relevant commands for my project and should be accessible whenever default-directory is in that project (meaning accessible from dired, magit, any visited files in that project, etc.).
 What are the options?

                              <span>For reference, I&#x27;ve been using emacs since about 1987. I went through an XEmacs &quot;phase&quot;, then returned to GNU Emacs. In all this time, I am very aware of the fact that I&#x27;ve never used any significant part of its power.
 Around the release of 29.1 with tree-sitter, I chose to wholly re-write my config. I tossed almost everything I had, and pulled things back in piece-wise as I found I needed them. I also took the opportunity to add in a few things I had always heard great enthusiasm for (counsel, ivy, company, swiper to name a few).
 And now... I&#x27;m barely using any of the new stuff. Maybe I tried to add too much too quickly? How do others integrate all these truly useful packages into your daily flow?

 I am aware ediff just showing the output of diff. But then, while exercising ediff session, can we tell ediff or &quot;diff&quot; to generate the patch file?

                              <span>Is there an emacs function or package to delete a wrapper form while keeping the body? For example if I need to delete a &#x27;when&#x27; condition but keep the body. Or realize I no longer need a &#x27;save-excursion&#x27; but do need the body code.
 It&#x27;d have to be language sensitive. For example &#x27;when&#x27; and &#x27;let&#x27; have one arg before the body but &#x27;save-excursion&#x27; has none. Wondering if anything already exists before I start trying to write it myself.

 Everything works fine when I use emacs that is build from source.
 Things get interesting when I use mituharu emacs mac port. I need to run M-x modus-themes-toggle after startup for the theme to properly load my config above.Also I need to run M-x org-mode-restart for this configuration to take effect - &#x27;(modus-themes-org-blocks &#x27;tinted-background).
 This issue only persists on mituharu emacs macport.
 Any insights in to this is highly appreciated.

                              <span>Guys hi, elisp newbie here :)
 I need to be able to run python script with M-x function (so i can bind it to hotkey). So far i have this:
 (defun my/mysimplefunction () (interactive) (insert (shell-command-to-string &quot;python mysimplefunction.py&quot;))) 
 I have 2 problems with it:
 1, how to set default directory for script, or absolute path? Cause right now script works only if current buffer is in same directory as
 2, i don&#x27;t need function output to be inserted in current buffer (it&#x27;s script without output). Now it ouputs (error, etc) to current buffer. (It can ouput to &quot;*messages&quot;, but it&#x27;s not necessary)
 Update: Made it work with
 (defun my/mysimplefunction () (interactive) (shell-command-to-string &quot;python /AbsolutePath/mysimplefunction.py&quot;)) 
 Won&#x27;t delete the thread in case it will be helpful to someone with same question in future.

                              <span>I have written a test program that uses--parent-id option to embed an Emacs session, and noticed that it starts with a set size, but does not resize to match changes to the parent window size.
 The problem can be seen here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17982831/emacs-embedded-in-a-qt-application
 Can it detect some changes to the parent window and user set-frame-size to adjust itself to match? Or perhaps set scroll bars if the parent size shrinks below some preset levels?
 I just noticed that the command-line-args variable removes some of the command line arguments after they&#x27;ve been processed.
 Is there some way of retaining the original list? The --parent-id parameter seems to be removed after it has been processed.

                              <span>I am having a problem with the cape package. Whenever cape-file is called via completion-at-point it returns nil but if I call it directly with M-x it works.
 This is my entire config file. I am on emacs version 29.1
 ​
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (package-install &#x27;cape) (package-install &#x27;corfu) (require &#x27;cape) (setq cape-dabbrev-min-length 3) (dolist (backend &#x27;(cape-dabbrev cape-elisp-symbol cape-file)) (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions backend)) (require &#x27;corfu) (global-corfu-mode 1) (setq tab-always-indent &#x27;complete) (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(package-selected-packages &#x27;(corfu cape))) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. ) 
 I call (debug-on-entry #&#x27;cape-file) in ielm and then press TAB with my cursor over a string that is a prefix for a valid file name. I enter the debugger so I know cape-file is being called but it ends up returning nil. When I then press M-x and call cape-file interactively it also brings up the debugger but this time it completes the filename accurately. If anyone has any idea what&#x27;s going on or knows how to fix this I would be very appreciative.

But I have a capture template that insert to an org-table that related to such habit. Is there a way to make changing todo state to done not only filling the Logbook drawer but also get me to that specific org-capture-templates.
 current behavior: Changing state to done -&gt; Logging to drawer, running org-capture,
 expected behavior: Changing state to done -&gt; Logging to drawer -&gt; capturing with predetermined template (all in one swoop)
 Thanks

                              <span>I use org mode agenda with Doom Emacs.
 Sometimes I want to list the whole agenda, but other times I want to filter it so it only shows the agenda items that is in one org file.
 F.ex. &quot;show me my agenda but only include items from work.org&quot;
 then after work I want &quot;show me my agenda but only include items from parties.org&quot;
 Is this possible without too much fuzzing about or do I need to tag everything f.ex.?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a medical student. I currently use org mode for managing a task list and have quite enjoyed using it together with orgzly, termux running Emacs and beorg. I would really like to use org-roam for maintaining my notes in medicine however I find that there to be a few parts of my workflow that are stopping me from just using Emacs and orgmode:
  
When I go to placement, I often like to just use the computers that are there. These hospital computers as you can imagine are locked pretty securely and so its impractical for me to setup Emacs on these computers or run anything from a USB. I have previously used something web based like notion.so but the experience was far from satisfactory.
 I unfortunately fell into the trap of buying an iPad for medical school and I want to make the most use of it. I will ocassionally bring this to placement and would like to be also take notes on my iPad.
 I do often have to look or reference my notes while on my phone. So quick offline access to my notes synced through syncthing is ideal.
  
I am currently considering using obsidian.md which uses markdown files. I can then sync these files with my phone and iPad and use the obsidian apps on either device. On my own computer I am thinking of using Emacs with https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el. On computers at placement I am considering having my org files in a private repo on gitlab or github and then using the built in text editor on thos platforms.
 My question therefore is: is there a better alternative for my workflow/use-case that mainly uses org mode files as opposed to using obsidian?
 EDIT: I am open to also using pandoc to convert org and md files as long as the process can be somewhat automated.

 Parser i seems to implement some distorted version of Monad
 I haven&#x27;t come up with a definitive proof but on the surface level identity laws seems to hold. I&#x27;m not so sure about composition but my tests (albeit a small set) gave me affirmative results. 
 I get a sensible free implementation for fmap. However i failed to get a free implementation for join and apply which makes me suspicious that the composition law indeed does not hold. Instead of banging my head against the compiler i wanted to ask you where exactly the problem is

                              <span>Hi all,
 I started Haskell this week, and I&#x27;m completely in love. Compared to my previous languages (Python, Java, C++) Haskell is just utterly beautiful. I can&#x27;t get enough of it.
 I&#x27;m finding the language difficult at times. Not because the language itself is difficult - it isn&#x27;t - but for a few other reasons:
 1) Learning resources are far more limited than for other languages. Resources for learning on mobile, in particular, seem almost non-existent. Does anyone have any they&#x27;d recommend?
 2) When my code doesn&#x27;t work, I find Haskell&#x27;s error messages very hard to interpret. Does this get easier?
 3) Input/output seems trickier than elsewhere. Anyone have anything I can read that might make them click? I&#x27;ve been mainly solving Codewars problems so I can bypass my input/output block.

                              <span>One of Haskell&#x27;s arguably most important and interesting features is lazy evaluation.
 As a novice / intermediate (I started learning Haskell about a year ago and am really enjoying it!), I still can&#x27;t explain the advantages of lazy evaluation in real world applications. 
 After a bit of duckduckgoing, the first benefit that is often mentioned is the ability to create infinite data structures. While that is certainly interesting and fun to work with, it feels somewhat gimmicky to me. As mentioned, I am a novice, so I wonder, are infinite data structures a feature you regularly use in real world applications, and are they important in these applications? By that I mean that they are clearly better to use in that position than code without the infinite data structure?
 Another benefit that is often mentioned is the possibility to define control structures in normal code. To my understanding, this is the case for many monad combinators such as when or replicateM, and so on. Again I wonder how relevant this is in real applications, as most programming languages suffice with a few basic control structures.
 Furthermore, it seems that the monadic control structures still require the do notation to be useful, which is not defined in normal code, and when defining control structures for a new type class (such as arrows), new syntax defined outside of normal code is still required, as arrows seem to have their own special variant of do notation.
 Finally, there seems to be a performance trade off with haskells lazy evaluation, as lazy evaluation inherently has overhead, but might avoid unnecessary calculations. I wonder if these unnecessary calculations could not be avoided by better programming?
 All in all, how useful is haskells lazy evaluation, and is it a feature that should be adopted by other (new) programming languages? Or maybe is that a question that is still being researched / explored?

                              <span>Hi all, new member and have been running a physical zettelkasten for nearly a month now. So far I&#x27;m largely filling it with ideas I&#x27;ve been turning over in my mind for a while rather than the product of new reading. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that these ideas should be sat on for a while before they turn into permanent notes and so a zettelkasten would be unsuitable for learning a new field or subfield, which would be better served by a sort of lab manual or similar (not being an academic, I don&#x27;t particularly need to preserve citations). Like an accounting system that uses a memorandum sheet, a journal, and then a ledger, with the zettelkasten being analogous to the last.
I got into this from Scheper&#x27;s book, but I&#x27;m not a purist and I found his approach a little too dogmatic. But what I don&#x27;t recall from his book or Luhmann&#x27;s zettelkasten is recording the date each card was written. I don&#x27;t know if that information is useful, but I&#x27;ve been including it on each card.</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I have just switched doing my (hobbyist) Haskell dev on VSCode on Windows to VSCode on Windows / WSL:Ubuntu 20.04. After a full compile on both and doing a minor change I am seeing a 20X speed improvement in WSL vs running all the same cabal build under plain old Windows. This speed improvement is predictably cascading through to the tooling (HLS starting and making significant code changes, running GHCID) . 
 It feels like all the tooling has snapped to life with the switch to WSL.
 Needless to say I&#x27;ll be sticking with WSL but I&#x27;m curious if this is a common experience for Windows users or if I&#x27;m an outlier on this one?

                              <span>Hello, while trying to understand Haskell better, I used the map and foldl functions in Haskell. I noticed a discrepancy between the forms of the two functions, as seen below:
 Prelude&gt; map (*2) [1..5] [2,4,6,8,10] Prelude&gt; foldl (*)2 [1..5] 240 
 In map, changing (*2) to (*)2 produces an error.
 In foldl, changing (*)2 to (*2) produces an error.
 Why is there this discrepancy in forms between the two functions?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi Friends of Haskell,
 It is our pleasure to announce that ZuriHac 2024 will take place Saturday 8 June - Monday 10 June 2024 as a physical event at the Rapperswil-Jona campus of the OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences.
 The focus of ZuriHac is being a community event and hackathon, but we will also have some exciting keynotes from Ningning Xie, Alex McLean, Ivan Perez and Mary Sheeran. In addition to that, there will be some more hands-on content: Well-Typed will host a workshop, Jesper Cockx will host an Agda track and Manuel Bärenz will host an FRP Track.
 We also welcome beginners or people unfamiliar to Haskell who are curious to learn more. Eliane Schmidli will teach a beginners workshop, and there will be many mentors from the Haskell Community happy to answer all your questions.
 Two days prior to ZuriHac, the Haskell Foundation and OST will organize a co-located 2-day Haskell Infrastructure Workshop. More details about that will be announced soon.
 You can find more information about the event and register at https://zurihac.info.
 The event is free for participants. This is only possible with the help of our generous supporters, who are currently:
  
The Haskell Foundation
 Jane Street
 OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences
 Tweag
 Well-Typed
  
In case you would like to support ZuriHac, please get in touch with us.
 We hope to see you there! The Zurich Friends of Haskell

 I followed this and got the same error.
 ​
 the comment says that we need to run the command in the main directory [duckling-0.2.0.0 for me]. I did that but it didn&#x27;t help.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m new to emacs and I’m not sure how to fix these issues. For some reason, typescript-ts-mode and tsx-ts-mode are not correctly highlighting function calls. Typescript-mode does correctly highlight them, but it doesn&#x27;t parse TSX, so I was going to use tsx-ts-mode for .tsx and typescript-mode for .ts. I installed the grammar with treesit-install-language-grammar and added it to the auto-mode-alist with (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tsx\\&#x27;&quot; . tsx-ts-mode)), but this is what my syntax highlighting looks like:
 tsx-ts-mode: no function call highlighting
 typescript-mode: no jsx highlighting
 If anyone has encountered and fixed this problem I would greatly appreciate you telling me how you fixed it. Also, for some reason, tsx files force me to have 2 space indentation despite typescript-indent-level and tab-width both being 4. Any advice for how to fix this would also be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!

                              <span>When compiling/installing a new version of emacs, like 29.2 which just came out, I generally just remove ~/.emacs.d and let it re-fetch and do all its startup stuff on first start.
 Is there any user-level config stuff in there that I&#x27;m in danger of losing? I haven&#x27;t noticed any ill effects (other than the 1-time startup time hit), so I&#x27;m guessing if there is it&#x27;s subtle.

 It is not the guide for advanced stuff like Programming In Elisp, but more for a developer wanting to contribute to Emacs itself at a low level, using C, modules, internal C data structures etc.

                              <span>One of the reasons I&#x27;m trying out Emacs is so I can use the wonderful Input font, which is proportional, not monospaced. I&#x27;ve got it working like I want it except that I have to M-x variable-pitch-mode every time to get it on... is there a way to make variable pitch mode the default? Would I need to use a hook to activate it every time I enter a buffer? I&#x27;d rather not make the proportional font my font for everything, but I&#x27;d like all text in &quot;normal&quot; text buffers to use this proportional font.

 Any line in a python file with a &quot;red&quot; eglot error in flycheck now gets greyed out, which to me is completely counterproductive to actually fixing the errors, since the code just gets harder to read. I&#x27;ve done some googling and can&#x27;t find anything useful. Does anyone know what package might be causing this, and where I can switch it off? Thanks!

 Update: it could have something to do with font-lock-mode
 Update 2: seems to be linked to captures, if the file that is being written to is also visible.

                              <span>Some tasks occur monthly and I can schedule them for the beginning of the month with a deadline at the end of the month recurring each month. But for some of my tasks that doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense.
 I have to hold 3 tutoring sessions per semester. I can&#x27;t figure out if I should create 3 separate tasks that are all scheduled for the beginning of the semester with a deadline at the end of the semester, or if I should have one task that is scheduled for the beginning of the semester, repeats every 1.5 months with a deadline at the end of the semester, or if there is a simpler way to do this.
 Advice is appreciated!

 Is there any way to have gopher:// and gemini:// URLs work the same way as http:// when clicked ? (calls out to the OS to open the default browser, and allows you to export an org-mode doc to other formats without complainig that those links couldn&#x27;t be resolved? )

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a relatively minimalist code formatter. Scalafmt is good for large teams to make the codebase consistent, but for some projects I&#x27;d be interested in something that allows more flexibility but still help you out. With features like:
  
check/warn/error on line length
 align closing brackets/parens to the indentation of the opening bracket/paren
 align series of whatever (params mostly I suppose) to the indentation of the first one
 mirror spaces around closing brackets/parens to the opening. eg. if ( thing) becomes if ( thing )
 etc. basically providing localized syntax consistency rather than global
  
If nothing like this exists, would anyone be interested in it?

                              <span>Hey.
 Scala is known for its ability to model complex domains and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) is known for the same thing.
 Are there anything like that (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-domain-driven-design-ddd-in-golang-2e2139beb09d) but for Scala? I&#x27;m thinking of articles, videos, tutorials which contain simple introduction or step-by-step guides for implementing DDD with Scala.

 The goal of this case study is to merge increment-only counters, mimicking an eventually consistent system. Although somewhat long, I show my code below.

This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.  🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Knowledge work in public.
I&#x27;m exploring a method of changing the format of all my links so I can interact with software that uses the literal file name in the link.
I&#x27;m exploring how I&#x27;m using the YAML frontmatter. This is a part of the file that could be a rich source of knowledge.

So i want to uninstall everything related ti emacs and start over with a fresh clean pack. So how can i uninstall emacs on a silicon mac? And i am open for your suggestions about how to install doom emacs? please help

                              <span>I would like to contribute my little story. I started using Emacs with the Spacemacs distro (great distro!). I used it for a year and realized that the amount of things to learn is much greater. I learned Vim keybindings, Spacemacs keybindings, modal editing. I also learned the concepts of Emacs, Org Mode, Magit. I realized that some things don&#x27;t happen so quickly, and I also started to get tired of modal editing and only using the keyboard to perform actions. So, I decided to try vanilla Emacs. I noticed that the contents of the main menu, the button menu and the modeline change according to the position of the pointer, that is, the GUI presents the options in a contextual way. Now I can work effectively using the keyboard and mouse and receiving feedback from the interface regarding commands and key combinations that I always forget. And finally, I gave up on maintaining a configuration file (for now), I learned to use &#x27;customize&#x27;. I&#x27;m really amazed at what you can do with absolutely no configuration initially! Some advice for beginners (I still am): - Enable CUA mode at the very beginning and migrate to default over time - Learn the concepts (Emacs is a platform!) - Learn how GUI behaves - Learn the key combinations - Learn Org Mode (this is f****** awesome!) - Have a good time!

                              <span>I mostly edit C++, and for that language clangd and Tree Sitter both have interesting and mutually exclusive highlighting possibilities, so I am using both of them for highlighting at once (using lsp-mode and c++-ts-mode) . I would like for treesit highlighting defined in treesit-font-lock-settings to take priority over lsp-semantic-tokens highlighting where they disagree, but I&#x27;m really struggling to figure out how or find a case where somebody else has already done this. Does anyone have advice on how to handle this problem?

                              <span>Howdy! I am a 4th year university student who has some spare time (I have to take an extra year) to learn tools. For context, right now I use kitty+tmux and neovim to do most of my note taking and general linux stuff. This includes compiling and writing in LaTeX, script writing, etc.
 For context: I&#x27;ve used emacs in the past and like emacsclient + the other useful tools emacs has to offer out of the box, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed really sensible to me. DistroTube recently came out with his series on building a sensible config from scratch which I&#x27;ve played with for a bit, but I don&#x27;t want to fully commit if what I want isn&#x27;t possible.
 What I am looking for: - ability to act as a terminal - pdf viewing with latex editing side by side - being able to navigate to other workspaces to view pdfs and navigate through them with vim-like binds - extensible (which emacs is) - ability to integrate zettelkasten with a pdf open in another pane/split within the same program
 The general idea I want is it do everything I need to do school/productivity wise within emacs, and nothing else. My current setup works, but I like seeing what else is out there. Let me know how doable this would be.
 Please go easy on me I know there&#x27;s probably a post like this on here once a week. :&#x27;)

                              <span>I want to have some GUI programs displayed in Emacs buffer windows.
 Is there an API for doing this with some examples for doing this? Currently I use EXWM and regular GUI program windows do show up and I can use them normally, but I need something native to Emacs and not based on XCB or other windowing modes used by Emacs programs.
 I suspect that Xwidgets (GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual) and An Emacs Dynamic Module for WebKit may be working along such lines but I need simple examples that are not so web-focused.
 I am not even sure whether my concept of forms in GUI Apps conform to what Emacs calls native widgets.

I&#x27;d like to draw on your experience for some keyboard options that can really highlight the capabilities of emacs and minimise some of the disadvantages such as potential for increased RSI. 
 What do you all use and what would you suggest?
 Thanks for your time!

                              <span>Hi all! I write Rust using eglot and rustic and it works great! I can jump to the definition of an identifier with xref-find-definitions, and I can see the type of the binding with eldoc or with inlays.
 However, I don&#x27;t know how to quickly jump to the type of an identifier?
 Rust uses type inference a lot, so the concrete type is often not spelled out in the source code. This means that I don&#x27;t have the type to use as a starting point. An example:
 rust let foo &#x3D; build_me_a_foo(); 
 Here I would like to be able to jump to the Foo type which build_me_a_foo presumably returns. Today I do this by jumping to the definition of build_me_a_foo and then jump further from the function signature.
 Reading the Emacs manual, I see that I could use C-u M-. to get a prompt for the identifier to jump to. The very large list presented to me does contain what I need, but I need to spell it out based on what eldoc showed me in the mode line.
 Has anybody written the code to look up the type and then feed it directly into C-u M-.?

I&#x27;m not so much interested in getting to compile as I am in determining whether or not this is a book I ought to read. 
 If it is too outdated to be practical, has anyone written a replacement on the subject?

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m currently writing a bytecode interpreter for a programming language in Haskell. I&#x27;ve written most of it so far but the main problem is that the actually execution of a program is very slow, roughly 10x slower than Python. When profiling the execution of the program, I noticed that most of the time is being spent simply getting the next byte or incrementing the instruction pointer. These operations are simply changing an Int in a StateT monad. Is Haskell simply the wrong language for writing a backend VM or are there optimizations that can be done to improve the performance. I should mention that I&#x27;m already running with -O2. Thanks
 edit - added code:
 I&#x27;m adding what I hope is relevant parts of the code, but if I&#x27;m omitting something important, please let me know.

 I started writing a number guessing game as an excercise. The game should proceed as follows:
 - Generate a random number 1..15
 - Ask the user for a number 1..15
 - If the numbers match, congratulate the user, otherwise ask if they wish to continue
 - If the user wants to continue, go to step 1
 - Otherwise, exit.

 I am having problems with the function that asks the user if they want to continue. I have boiled my problem down one half-solution:

 I have a question regarding ghc bootstrapping. It used to be the case that you could build an unregistered ghc for a new platform by compiling to .hc files. Copying the build dist over to the new platform and then using a g compiler to build them.
 I am wanting to port ghc to a platform with a c compiler, but no gcc or llvm port. This seems like the best option if it’s still working!
 Anyone know anything helpful?
 Edit: I realise that Hadrian makes this hard…. I’d need a cross compiler to create the build program on the target system….
 Edit 2: I think Hadrian would have to be adapted to generate hc files and makes files. But in all seriousness, isn’t this a good idea? It’s a bit of a barrier porting ghc to new platforms if the bootstrap process involved digging up ghc 6 and working up to 9.
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m making fun in my life implementing Parser (and it&#x27;s really fun), but i would like to ask following.
 i have Parser a :: Parser String -&gt; Either String (a, String)
 let&#x27;s say i have a list of parsers ps &#x3D; [p1, p2, p3 ...]
 How can i push input string through all of them, and i&#x27;m looking for 2 solutions:
 Alternative (so we get first successful result)
 Chain (so i apply them one by one and output from p1 is input for p2), and its successful only if all of them are worked.
 I think this is pretty simply, but my brains are old, i have 39&#x27; temperature and need to solve it to feel better.
 Here is gh, code is located in lib/Parseme.hs

 -- Return rank for the given key or 0 if absent
 rank :: Int -&gt; State UnionFind Int

in GHC. Which means that we’ll have these in GHC 9.10, which is cause
for celebration for me. Though they are much overdue, so maybe I
should instead apologise to you.
Anyway, I thought I’d take the opportunity to discuss some of
GHC’s inner workings and how they explain some of the features of

                              <span>I&#x27;m starting to use dependencies in TODOs in org mode. For now I&#x27;m using only parent-child dependencies; i.e. I&#x27;ve set org-enforce-todo-dependencies to t so that attempting to move a task to a DONE state is blocked if the task in question has child tasks that have not yet been marked as DONE. And I have that working fine...
 ... but only if I to try to mark the task as DONE using C-c C-t (which runs (org-todo &amp;optional ARG) ).
 But if instead I try to mark the task as DONE using S- (which runs (org-shiftright &amp;optional ARG) which will in turn, &quot;on a headline, switch to the next TODO keyword&quot; then the task in question gets switched to the next keyword, including DONE if that&#x27;s next in the sequence, regardless of any children still being not DONE. In other words, it looks like the process triggered by S- ignores the value of org-enforce-todo-dependencies.
 Is that how it&#x27;s supposed to work?

                              <span>Title. When creating note in org mode often i&#x27;d like to reference where i get idea/thought from. Currently i simply copy paste text inside org mode (in separate &quot;reference&quot; note)
 Is it good approach? Or is there a better way? I am complete newbie in referencing but often see mentions of BibTeX, Zotero, etc. 
 Would with any of them i be able to simply click link in my org note and it will bring me right to the highlighted paragraph inside epub or pdf?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a senior in high school planning to go into cs during college and have been looking to reinvent my workflow. I&#x27;ve seen a couple videos about the power of emacs org mode and I&#x27;m very interested in using it myself. My current setup is 1 laptop running windows 11, a boox note air 2+ running android, and a iphone running iOS. For me, I would like to use my e-ink tablet to markup lecture slides, take notes etc, and have it sync to all my devices. Would syncthing be good for this purpose? Accessing emacs from my phone would be a big plus but I&#x27;ve heard that this is easier on an android phone. 
 As of now I have no experience programming (planning to learn python in my free time) and don&#x27;t really know what a text editor is or really what emacs is as a whole. 
 I would also love to use emacs org mode for: 
 -planner 
 - TODO lists 
 Any help on how to go out this would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been trying to change my c coding style in Emacs.
 I tried to change the style with c-set-style but I haven&#x27;t found the one I was looking for, which is something like this.
 void stack_push (int val, stack* s) { element* e &#x3D; _make_element(val); if (!e) return; e-&gt;next &#x3D; s-&gt;head; s-&gt;head &#x3D; e; }; 
 If you know a style that looks like that, or the main Elisp commands to get it looking like this, let me know.
 ​
 I&#x27;m new to Emacs (been using it for less than 3months) and I haven&#x27;t touched Elisp that much (only for setting up some packages and configuration).
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi all, Exactly as it says in the title, running the function on an org latex fragment results in the error. I run Emacs on Wsl 2 on Windows 11, compiled from from source with pgtk. I found a post from last week that solves this issue by compiling emacs using the default method. However, compiling with pgtk was the only working solution I had found to a problem of blurry text in emacs. 
 Does anyone have a solution for this? Thank you in advance.

 I am trying to create the ability within emacs to push c- to insert a heading and M-. to insert a - into the document.
 ​
 I know that spacemacs has this function but when trying to use describe bindings and attempting to create the function inside my doom Emacs it won&#x27;t take.
 ​
 TLDR: How to create a function that creates a heading or list.

                              <span>I just wanted to share a delightful moment I had today. I&#x27;m currently working on a NMEA-based protocol for some microcontroller stuff. NMEA uses a simple format:
 $*\r\n 
 And in my tests I need to write the message, and then compute the checksum over message. A simple byte-wise or. There are websites for this, or I could write a script - but that always means leaving emacs, copy-and-pasting around.
 But this is an extensible editor! This snippet does it for the marked region and inserts at point.
  (defun deets/nmea-checksum () (interactive) (let ((checksum (format &quot;%02X&quot; (apply &#x27;logxor (mapcar (lambda (c) c) (buffer-substring (mark) (point))))))) (save-excursion (insert (format &quot;*%s\\r\\n&quot; checksum))))) 
 There&#x27;s some obvious extensions like ignoring a leading $, ensuring I&#x27;m always appending at the end, and possibly even replacing an already existing checksum with the new one. But even in this most basic, cost-me-5-minutes-to-build version it&#x27;s a productivity boost and just plain joy for me :D

                              <span>I know there are problems with Emacs (29.1) and the current version of GnuPG (2.4.X), causing Emacs to hang indefinitely when trying to access GnuPG tools (like saving an encrypted file). 
 Until now, the only workaround was to downgrade GnuPG (and by the way, this script fails as well). And since Homebrew doesn&#x27;t have 2.4.0 version, I went all the way down to 2.2, however, the problem persists and I can&#x27;t save encrypted files from Emacs. 
 I&#x27;ve tried on two M1 machines (both with macOS 14.2.1) and I get the same behavior. Since (fset &#x27;epg-wait-for-status &#x27;ignore) is dangerous and can corrupt your file, what else can I try?

                              <span>When I don&#x27;t know the name of something, I love being able to M-x and start typing and orderless finds stuff, including the stuff where I have the names ordered wrong.
 This morning, I wanted to make a new org-roam node so I SPC-m-f (org-roam-node-find) and enter the name of the new node: Archiving in Org Mode. Unfortunately, there is already a node named OrgMode Archiving and that&#x27;s what was selected. Here is my config:
  (use-package orderless :config (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless basic) completion-category-defaults nil completion-category-overrides &#x27;((file (styles partial-completion))))) 
 Orderless finding that node would have been fine if I had a way of canceling its choice and telling it to use what I typed instead. Usual cancel keys ESC or C-g didn&#x27;t do the job.
 ​
 Solved: Thanks everyone. The completion was Vertico. I had set M-k as previous in Vertico, and that was indeed what was needed- select what I typed and not the entry Vertico found. I&#x27;m a simple man, up arrow is easier for me to remember.

 GNU ELPA stands for &quot;Emacs Lisp Package Archive&quot;, which is a repository of packages created by the GNU Emacs community. In order to submit a package to the GNU ELPA repository, a package must be licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and require a copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to be included in core Emacs. NonGNU ELPA allows for packages to be included without the copyright assignment, and while it does not go into core Emacs, it is still an official and popular archive for Emacs Lisp packages.
 GNU ELPA and NonGNU ELPA are both enabled by default but since MELPA is an unofficial archive it isn&#x27;t and requires you to manually install it. Despite it being an unofficial archive, MELPA is still managed by the Emacs Lisp Package Archive Team, and it has a strict screening policy, so only high-quality packages that meet the licensing requirements can be included.

                              <span>Anybody else had a problem like this or have any ideas on possible fixes? I&#x27;m using pgtk emacs 29.1 on wayland (gnome 45, running the emacs-wayland package on arch linux, but also happens with custom-built emacs 29.1 on pop_os). The tab-bar renders halfway like this, and the bottom half flickers in and out. It only happens when I have an internal-border-width set on the frame (currently via the spacious-padding package).

 edit: I installed the non-pgtk version to test, and I see that the tabs are right at the top of the frame in that version, so maybe a pgtk bug with tab-bar positioning?

                              <span>Say someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) reads constant SomeClass.C1 for its computation.
 I used to consider it as non-pure because it reads a hidden state C1 , which is not a parameter of this method.
 But someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a method. The real function in terms of FP should be something like someMethod(someClassAndItsImmutableProperties, v1, v2) , then C1 is part of the parameter.
 So someClass.someMethod(v1, v2) is a pure function. Is my understanding correct?

 I&#x27;m an intermediate Haskell programmer at best, but I didn&#x27;t feel any need to go beyond some basic techniques while solving these puzzles. That&#x27;s a good thing, as it ensure the puzzles are accessible to a wide audience.

                              <span>Hi there, sorry in advance if this is the wrong place to ask for help. I am brand new to Haskell and unfortunately can&#x27;t even get passed stack build yesod-bin
 I&#x27;m on Mac OS X Monterey (12.3) with M1, and am getting the following error when running the above command. Stack is installed via homebrew. I&#x27;ve scoured the internet and have found no one else mentioning this problem. Any inkling of what the hell I should do would be greatly appreciated 🙏🏼
 The version of yesod-bin I am using is 1.6.2.2 (latest), but I have tried to specify earlier versions in my stack.yaml file and am seeing the same issue.

A seriously long time lurker (3+ years) turned member here.
Through that time lurking, I&#x27;ve gained incredibly valuable insight for working with Zettelkasten, avoided many pitfalls and had the apprehension of working with the system reduced significantly.
Many thanks to Sascha, Christian, and those who regularly frequent these forums for providing that valuable information. This forum is a cave full of treasures.
...
So I&#x27;m finally posting with what I hope is useful for someone else, as it has been for me; a formalised system for organising a Zettelkasten, that takes a very critical look at categorisation, folders and tags. The driving concern being reducing &quot;cognitive friction&quot; when creating and writing notes.
I&#x27;ve moved through many of the different recommendations on here for …</span>

                              <span>I have a quick question about refiling, if anyone has any insights!
 I&#x27;d really like to add properties (as if a capture) to an item as I refile. Let&#x27;s say I quickly jotted down in beorg &quot;True Grit&quot; and when I&#x27;m refiling I want to add that to my movie list but also add properties like TODO state and then a property drawer with things like the GENRE, RELEASE, RATING etc. etc. Is that possible at all to make it a one step process instead of a two step process (refile and then add property template). Or is best to just re-enter the information with a capture and then delete the original heading?

                              <span>Some may remember me asking about migrating my TiddlyWiki instances to org a while back. I&#x27;m now actively working on that conversion, starting with the two relatively small instances. Once I have those done and have learned from my many anticipated mistakes, I&#x27;ll tackle the journal for my day-job.
 My question is this, and it&#x27;s not necessarily TW-centric: for those of you with comparable situations, do you use one larger (centralized) org file, or one master file that mostly contains overview/contents and links to a number of smaller files, one per topic?
 I&#x27;ll give an example: one my my TW instances is for my FOSS projects (mostly modules, mostly for Perl at this point). I have about 17 separate topics in it, each one ranging from 5-6 lines of text to the largest being about a full page by itself. Would you folks be more inclined to have a single file (a la the original TiddlyWiki), or break each topic into its own sub-file?
 I realize that org is going to be capable of jumping around a large file as easily as it can jump between files, at least that&#x27;s the impression I&#x27;ve gotten. I guess I&#x27;m interested in what people find works best for them?

                              <span>This is my org writing environment and LaTeX export styling for generic, essay-assignment like documents. I have used iterations of this for actual course assignments, grant applications, and more, with font styles and so on adjusted to the intended reader (I would use a more &quot;technical&quot; typeface for a physics related document than for a didactic/pedagogy assignment, for example). I really like this as a writing environment and use it whenever I can get away with it. 
 The document class is Koma-script scrartcl that I have set up an export for. I have no math or images here, but would just use the standard math font for that - I like it when math glyphs look different from text glyphs.

                              <span>I use the following in my emacs init file:
  
&#x27;(org-todo-keywords &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO&quot; &quot;WAITING&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE&quot; &quot;CANCELLED&quot;)))
  
I noticed what may be a bug that I have not been able to replicate. In my org-mode file I have a repeating task similar to the one below:
  
TODO Wash car 
 
  
After completing the task, I type c-t c-d. Because the task is repeating, org-mode typically reschedules the task one month into the future. However, when I typed c-t c-d, the status of the task changed to DONE.
 Without changing any of the syntax, I typed c-t c-t, which toggled the status back to TODO. After typing c-t c-d again, the task rescheduled one month into the future, as expected.
 I have been unable to replicate the error. Any explaination?

 org-timeblock
 https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock
 Emacs package that provides interactive multiple-day timeblock view for orgmode tasks.
 Also, might be used as a tool for timeblocking productivity technique.
 Changes
  
Added mark commands (mark-block, unmark-block, mark-by-regexp) for timeblocks that can be used to reschedule multiple tasks at once
 Replaced ts.el with built-in time API
 Replaced org-ql with own searching and caching functions
 dom.el is now used instead of regexps to fetch and change SVG data (much cleaner code)
 Deadline timestamps are now treated as it should be, not as events
 Now, each active timestamp in a heading body is displayed (as event), not only the first one
 Added custom variable org-timeblock-files
 Other minor bug fixes and improvements 8)

                              <span>Hi, my lsp-mode setup looks like this: 
 (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :ensure t :hook ((python-mode . lsp-deferred)) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) (lsp-register-custom-settings &#x27;((&quot;pylsp.plugins.flake8.enabled&quot; t t) (&quot;pylsp.plugins.autopep8.enabled&quot; t t) (&quot;pylsp.plugins.black.enabled&quot; t t) (&quot;pylsp-plugins.isort.enabled&quot; t t) (&quot;pylsp.plugins.rope-autoimport.enabled&quot; t t)))) 
 The *lsp-log* output for the lsp-mode startup is this:
 Command &quot;semgrep lsp&quot; is not present on the path. Command &quot;ruff-lsp&quot; is not present on the path. Command &quot;pylsp&quot; is present on the path. Command &quot;pyls&quot; is not present on the path. Command &quot;semgrep lsp&quot; is not present on the path. Command &quot;ruff-lsp&quot; is not present on the path. Command &quot;pylsp&quot; is present on the path. Command &quot;pyls&quot; is not present on the path. Found the following clients for /home/user/test.py: (server-id pylsp, priority -1) The following clients were selected based on priority: (server-id pylsp, priority -1) 
 So I think lsp-mode should be running correctly with pylsp, right? I have some IDE features working, but none of the custom settings are working. Any help would be much appreciated! :)

                              <span>I have encountered a strange issue when using Emacs to edit LaTeX files.
 When I type certain keywords, such as \begin or \section, they are turned into unicode symbols. Please see the screenshot for examples.
 This behaviour could have been fine, except that they don&#x27;t seem to function. For instance, the &quot;section&quot; symbol does not create a section in the document.
 It looks like it might have something to do with the input method for TeX, since I can find the symbols as &quot;translations&quot; of the keywords when I look there. Please see screenshot.
 I don&#x27;t encounter this problem when using emacs -Q but I also cannot find a LaTeX related culprit in my config, so I&#x27;m at a loss. I experience the behaviour both on my personal Linux computer and on my work Mac.
 Does anyone know what might cause this behaviour and how I can disable it?
 In case you think there might be something in my config and want to help me out by having a look, it&#x27;s available here.
 EDIT:
 Thank you for the help! Turns out it was related to corfu&#x27;s autocomplete. Setting corfu-auto to nil resolved the issue.

                              <span>Vim motions are great, but so are Emacs motions. I like to use both of them. However, when I installed Evil, I found that many keys (like C-p and C-n) don&#x27;t work as they used to. And if I&#x27;m right, they are not bind to any other function as well.
 Is there a way to use evil AND emacs keybindings.
 If there isn&#x27;t a way, is there a way to do things like move to the first character of a line, format (like you do in vim by selecting and pressing &quot;&#x3D;&quot;)?
 Edit: I have only followed the basic emacs tutorial and found a few useful keys here and there. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I think I&#x27;m going to stay.

                              <span>Has anyone successfully configured Emacs to run without freezing on macOS?
 On my macOS, Emacs exhibits random freezes, and this behavior varies across distributions like Emacs-Plus and EmacsMac. These freezes don&#x27;t seem tied to any specific package. And when it freezes, i can only force exit the whole process.
 I THINK EmacsMac tends to freeze more when in fullscreen mode on an external monitor. But each time I think I&#x27;ve pinpointed and resolved the issue, it unfortunately resurfaces.Most stack traces aren&#x27;t very enlightening, often showing repeated calls to functions like &#x27;mac_gui_loop&#x27;, &#x27;dispatch_semaphore_wait_slow&#x27;, and &#x27;redisplay_internal...&#x27;.
 Is there anyone who can run Emacs on macOS without experiencing these freezes for &gt;1 day? If so, what hardware are you using? Did you use any special configurations or fixes?
 Does native-compilation or any other flag influences this?
 I plan writing an article about Emacs on macOS, aiming for a stable and consistent environment. However, the inconsistency of these freezing issues makes it difficult to offer solid advice. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Install termux and emacs from these builds on sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/ ; these are signed and configured appropriately so that Android lets them access each other&#x27;s shared storage. Read the readme the…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I am just learning haskell and while trying to implement my own map function, I have encountered this weird issue:My first attempt to implement it was the following:
 mymap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b] mymap f (x:xs) | null xs &#x3D; [] | otherwise &#x3D; f x : mymap f xs 
 The problem with this one is that it always gave the mapped list without the last element, and I can see why. But my question is why does this code work:
 mymap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b] mymap f (x:xs) &#x3D; f x : mymap f xs mymap _ [] &#x3D; [] 
 and the previous doesn&#x27;t?

                              <span>I&#x27;m just getting started, so forgive me if this is naturally part of the method or just ... impractical in the long run, but so far it&#x27;s been my experience that people think a lot about their UID&#x27;s, copying them out if they&#x27;re analog, and just... it&#x27;s a lot.
my entire career as a Humanities professor, with diverse interests in Sciences, Maths, and pretty much everything, I was going to have to add another 0 to do those disciplines justice in the first place. 

  
10000 - Humanities
11000 - Arts (Performing and Visual)

  
11100 - Music

  

  
11200 - Theatre

  
12000 - History

  
12800 - English/British/UK History

  

  
12900 - French History

  
13000 - Literature

  
1381[act.scene]  (For some reason... when I was reading Bussy d&#x27;Ambois by George Chapman, I placed it here in Literature instead of in Theatre... If I recall, I had a reason for this. I don&#x27;t remember what it was, though. I want to say it was because I was saving &quot;Theatre&quot; for like... theatre theory? Anyway, to explain this UID, 13 for literature, 8 for George Chapman being English, 1 for George Chapman the author/playwright himself being the first author and 0 will be for Shakespeare. )

  
14000 - Philosophy

  
1401[book#].[Stephanus number(paragletter)]Folgezettel# - 1 for The Republic, 0 for Plato

  


I have two separate systems going, apparently, in two categories under Humanities. But they both reflect something important, I feel. 
I was wondering, does anyone else use their UIDs to tell them information about the card? I&#x27;m also using a date at the top, in case I can&#x27;t figure out where to put it when I first make the card [YYMMDD, of course.] Like, the way i use 8 to mean &quot;England/English&quot; or 9 to mean &quot;France/French&quot; under across History and Literature. Alternatively, 0 could mean Greece and 1 for Plato in the context of Philosophy&#x27;s 14018.532b1. Just thinking aloud.</span>

                              <span>Cross posting this from Discourse:
 I’ve been looking into Haskell’s data ecosystem. There seems to be a lot of foundational work that is missing that I’d like to help implement (if such efforts already exist) or start to implement with a group of Haskellers who have time. Namely:
  
A flat buffer library - the current one is abandoned and isn’t featured in the official flat buffer documentation despite some seemingly niche language called Lobster being supported.
 an Apache Arrow compatible data frame library (along with the rest of the apache arrow suite)
 A well supported plotting library
  
I think this was somewhat initially the vision of dataHaskell but that effort seems to have fizzled out. Were there learnings published somewhere? What were the pitfalls? Is there still activity in the community?

                              <span>I ran into this interesting repo https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/flat-maybe, which suggests something like niche optimization in Rust to save space allocation for the Maybe type. So I was wondering whether GHC has this kind of optimization or not. It seems that the Maybe and Either types are used frequently for error handling so such optimization can give big performance benefit.

                              <span>First time using TypeLits and Proxy. I want to convert bytestrings to fixed length vectors and have the vectors length be known on the type level.
 import GHC.TypeLits import Data.Proxy import qualified Data.ByteString as BS import qualified Data.Vector.Fixed as VF import Data.Word (Word8) class KnownNat n &#x3D;&gt; ValidByteStringLength n where byteVectorLength :: Proxy n -&gt; Int byteVectorLength proxy &#x3D; fromIntegral (natVal proxy) instance ValidByteStringLength 128 instance ValidByteStringLength 256 -- Add instances for all lengths I want to support -- A type alias for a fixed-length byte vector type ByteVector (n :: Nat) &#x3D; VF.ContVec n Word8 byteStringToByteVector :: forall n. ValidByteStringLength n &#x3D;&gt; BS.ByteString -&gt; Either String (ByteVector n) byteStringToByteVector bs | BS.length bs &#x3D;&#x3D; expectedLength &#x3D; Right $ (VF.fromList :: [Word8] -&gt; ByteVector n) . BS.unpack $ bs | otherwise &#x3D; Left &quot;ByteString length doesn&#x27;t match the target vector length&quot; where expectedLength &#x3D; byteVectorLength (Proxy @n) 
 However, I get
  • Couldn&#x27;t match type: Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.Peano (n + 1) with: Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.S (Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.Peano n) arising from a use of ‘VF.fromList’ 
 Here, S refers to the successor of its type argument, but does that not mean that the Peano numbers are equal? Does this happen because the compiler does not reduce it to n+1, rather than S(n), and conclude they are the same? Is this a bug? Am I overlooking something?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m having issues with doom emacs, when trying to use dap-mode.
 I have a working launch.json, I know it works because vscode can use it to start its own debugger,
 but when I try to start in emacs with M-x dap-debug, I get the following error message:
 user-error: Have you loaded the ldb specific dap package?
 ​
 Any tips? Thnaks!

 Any ideas how to investigate this?
 Or maybe someone has had this problem and solved it already.

                              <span>I dunno if anyone would have any ideas or tips but i have a list of plists of data and want to display in a buffer in columns.
 The tricky part is keeping them within the width of the window and truncating the text of a particular column when the text that would go on that line exceeds the self-imposed width of said column.
 I have something relatively working by mapping through the list and truncating the relevant strings from the data based off of calculations and inserting them into the buffer.
 This isn&#x27;t bad but, at larger amounts (say, 15,000 lines), things slow down, taking about a half a second.
 I&#x27;ve written it so the data is inserted into the buffer and, then, manipulating the text to get the truncated version directly in the buffer (saves about a tenth of a second) but it&#x27;s stil…</span>

 Surely some enterprising Emacs user must have created something like that by now, assuming its not built-in in the first place?

                              <span>Hi there! I am a noob, so please do forgive me if I don&#x27;t come across as competent with orgmode
 If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property &#x27;Category: Work&#x27;)--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?
 So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property &#x27;Category: Work&#x27;, would this TODO appear twice?
 I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?
 Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>I am trying to migrate to ibuffer instead of tabbar mode to switch between buffers. It would be convenient for me to have the ibuffer open and visible while I am editing a file, so I was trying the ibuffer-sidebar package. 
 It seems like a great package, however, I am trying to get around a minor inconvenience. Whenever I press enter on a buffer in ibuffer-sidebar, that buffer opens after splitting the window which contains the previous buffer into two. I would like to change the behavior to have the new buffer take up the full space. Any suggestions how I could achieve this?

 The point is that if I don&#x27;t manage to get out of bed by 7am this task should not appear as an overdue todo the following day as if I could still do it for the previous day. I want to mark it as failed on the day it was scheduled and also see it as a failed / not done state in the habit graph of the org agenda. Any ideas how this is typically done in orgmode?

                              <span>Hi there! I am a noob, so please do forgive me if I don&#x27;t come across as competent with orgmode
 If I run a python script on my .org files which creates a new .org file with all TODOs that meet certain property conditions (i.e. all TODOs with the property &#x27;Category: Work&#x27;)--will emacs consider these TODOs in the new .org file the same as, or different to, the TODOs that were originally copied?
 So, if I had a TODO in .org file 1, and python copied it to .org file 2, would emacs view these as separate TODOs? Basically, if a dynamic block called all TODOs with the property &#x27;Category: Work&#x27;, would this TODO appear twice?
 I ask because my specific workflow will likely require me to do something like this, and I am wondering if there is a way to do so without emacs thinking they are different. Might one way of doing this be to assign each TODO a unique identifier (UID) so that when I copy a TODO, the UID is copied too? Would this solve the issue of emacs possibly viewing both items as separate rather than the same?
 Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>I spent two evenings on a quick tool to experiment with URL schemes (like The Archive uses) to test something, then bundled this into an app:
https://github.com/CleanCocoa/OpenAny
Here&#x27;s the gist: you can create links to open file with app, e.g. to create a dashboard of sorts with Markdown notes in e.g. The Archive
openany://app/TextEdit/view?path&#x3D;/path/to/file.txt

Excerpt from the README
Why?
Any app that renders URLs as clickable links can now become your external app or file launchpad.
🎉 Create open-file-with-app links anywhere!
🌎 Assemble dashboards to your projects in your favorite note-taking app!
For example, you can use this in almost any Markdown editor with syntax highlighting to get a clickable link that will open TextEdit:

                              <span>Largely to give myself a quasi-useful purpose for messing with calling C++ functions from Emacs interactive functions, I wrote a wrapper around QuickFIX to allow decoding of FIX messages into an Org table for easy analysis of trades, etc. Rather niche - but it should serve as a reasonable template for anyone wanting to send data to some library written in C/C++ for transformation, and then use the result seamlessly in Emacs.

                              <span>hi there i am new to emacs world i have installed doom emacs and i am enjoying it alot many things i have figured out myself form the docs but there are some things related to vim emulsion that i can find how to do in emacs
 i have following code in my neovim config how can i replicate these in doom emacs in evil mode i read the map! macro docs but i cannot understand how can i do these
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lua vmap  &quot;+p (ie pasting in insert mode with C-v) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(&#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;o&#x27;, &#x27;o&#x27;, { noremap &#x3D; true }) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(&#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;O&#x27;, &#x27;O&#x27;, { noremap &#x3D; true })
 lvim.keys.normal_mode[&quot;&quot;] &#x3D; &quot;zz&quot; lvim.keys.normal_mode[&quot;&quot;] &#x3D; &quot;zz&quot;
 vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(&#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;ii&#x27;, &#x27;1z&#x3D;&#x27;, { noremap &#x3D; true , desc &#x3D; &quot;fix spelling&quot; }) vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(&#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;, &#x27; norm z&#x3D;1&#x27;, { noremap &#x3D; true, desc &#x3D; &quot;fix spell ins mode&quot; })
 keymap(&#x27;v&#x27;, &#x27;g&#x27;, function() local text &#x3D; vim.getVisualSelection() tb.current_buffer_fuzzy_find({ default_text &#x3D; text }) end, opts) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 these are - maping o,O to go to normal mode after creating new line - while doing C-d also center the buffer - in normal mode when cursor is on a wrong spelling fix it by replacing to closest match - similar keybinding in insert mode - select a word in visual mode and then fuzzy match its presence in live grep of the whole buffer
 if help me solve these issues it will give me a good direction on how to do similar things in future. Thanks :)

 Typst is a fairly new typesetting language which purports to be a more modern alternative to LaTeX. 
 Based on the VS-code extension https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typst-preview, I wrote a minor mode which gives a live preview while you edit your files (a la impatient mode). Feedback appreciated!
 Aside: There&#x27;s already a fair amount of support in emacs through &#x60;typst-ts-mode&#x60;: 
 https://git.sr.ht/~meow_king/typst-ts-mode (link is currently down due to sourcehut problems)
 and the lsp &#x60;typst-lsp&#x60;: https://github.com/nvarner/typst-lsp, which seems compatible with lsp-mode, so the typst writing experience is slowly catching up with auctex!

                              <span>I&#x27;m playing around with popup, and I&#x27;m having a hard time making a custom keymap work. This is kind of a hail mary, but I haven&#x27;t seen much activity on the project&#x27;s GitHub page, so I&#x27;m hoping someone here might be able to help me along.
 All I&#x27;m trying to do is add a function that will print a message right now. Nothing fancy, but my custom function isn&#x27;t being invoked at all, and I just cannot figure out why. I&#x27;ve tried multiple ways of creating the keymap, and none of them work. On top of that, I can call keymap-lookup on my temporary keymap and see that it&#x27;s pointing to the correct function. Any help would be appreciated.
 Code:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (require &#x27;popup)
 (cl-defun temp-select (p i) (message &quot;popup %s&quot; p))
 (defvar temp-keymap (let ((keymap (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent keymap popup-menu-keymap) (define-key keymap &quot;a&quot; &#x27;temp-select) keymap))
 (popup-menu* &#x27;(&quot;Thing&quot; &quot;Other&quot;) :width 30 :keymap temp-keymap :margin-left 2 :margin-right 2 :scroll-bar t) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hello. I installed two packages but need to manually enable them after opening Emacs to use them. Is there a way to have them enabled automatically when I open Emacs. Thank you!

                              <span>I use org tables to keep track of stuff. I have a number of field formulas that calculate stuff, some based on fields in other tables and others are simple mathematical expressions. If I add a row, say in the middle of such a table, all absolute field formulas below the added row will be broken since all field references will be off by one. I use relative references in some places to &quot;sum the five rows above&quot; etc, these do not break. Below is an example of formulas:
 @3$2 &#x3D; remote(table1_77,@&gt;$2) @15$2 &#x3D; ceil(8126/12) @16$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-9$2..@-1$2) @21$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-3$2..@-1$2) @34$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-11$2..@-1$2) @37$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-1$2..@-1$2) @39$2 &#x3D; ceil((6770/12)*0.44) @43$2 &#x3D; ceil(184*0.44) @45$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-6$2..@-1$2 @49$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-2$2..@-1$2) @59$2 &#x3D; ceil((4050*4)/(12*2)) @61$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-5$2..@-1$2) @71$3 &#x3D; vsum(@-8$2..@-1$2) @72$2 &#x3D; vsum(@3..@-1) @72$3 &#x3D; vsum(@2..@-1) @72$5 &#x3D; vsum(@2..@-1) @73$2 &#x3D; @-1$5-@-1$2 
 All field references on the left of &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; are such that can break when adding a row in the middle. I cannot come up with a way of making them relative and not breaking when adding rows. And I haven&#x27;t found a way for Org to automatically update all absolute field references below an inserted row. Is there a way to solve this?

 Is there a way to add this functionallity to org-roam daily without having to add the time manually?
 i also looked for a keybinding for adding the timestamp wuthout the day but i also have to add manually as the keyword now only works for date

 Optimally, it would also have org-agenda functionality.
 Thankful for any tips.

                              <span>My history is nothing special, Python, C, Golang with an interesting for lower level stuff. At some point everyone tries to learn Haskell and I’m generally a curious person, so I want to learn Haskell now. But I have a few mental issues that are being worked on. Because of that I rarely finish what I start and need someone to push me to do something. I can read documentations all I want then ‘haskell-learning’ will be another orphan on my GitHub. Are there any resources that I can code along, maybe a beginner to intermediate video series where someone implements an app or solves a problem? I guess there are not many because most Haskell devs are really smart and prefer to read. Hmm, I feel stupid, but I still want to know Haskell. I don’t know if this post is welcome here, if not, feel free to delete it. :)

                              <span>Hi Emacs friends. I&#x27;ve had a strange keyboard shortcuts issue come up today:
  
2 systems are sharing synced Emacs config
 Both systems have caps lock mapped to act as an additional ctrl key
 Both systems use KDE
 One system will allow some ctrl key shortcuts to be typed with caps lock (see below). C-S-s nope; C-S-d OK, for example.
  
Init.el:
 ;; Let&#x27;s save stuff more easily ;; This only works on one system when using caps as ctrl. ;; Kubuntu is OK with it--use caps as ctrl, this is fine ;; The other system Manjaro KDE only lets this work if pressing regular ctrl key, even though caps is mapped to ctrl (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-s&quot;) &#x27;save-buffer) ;; Let&#x27;s have the plain date at hand ;; This works fine on all systems when using caps as ctrl, incl. Manjaro (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-S-d&quot;) &#x27;plain-date) 
 I looked through my custom KDE shortcuts but C-S-s isn&#x27;t mapped to anything that I can see. 
 C-S-x also doesn&#x27;t work on this system unless I use the regular ctrl key.
 I also restarted Emacs just in case but it&#x27;s still happening.
 Thanks for any tips to troubleshoot this.
 Edit: Marking resolved since it seems to be a reported hardware issue with some Dell models, more here.

                              <span>I know this is stupid..
 I don&#x27;t know what I did or what information is being retained.. I use emacs from terminal on MacOS.. somehow I end up with a startup with a split view in the horizontal direction (top / bottom), so two buffers on startup... I just want one.
 What did I miss... or screw up in my init.el or is there some static information hanging around.
 Thanks ahead of time.

Is this possible? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, I wanted in future to do easy game in console. I have termux on phone and I&#x27;m on linux. I tried to move executable created from ghc file to phone using https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/android-file-transfer/, but my phone can&#x27;t see moved file. I already run termux-setup-storage, and I still can&#x27;t see my file.
 Do you know how can I make termux to work, or do you know any other way to make haskell executable or something similar works on phone?

                              <span>I want to test a function by comparing the return value against static content in test data files. I&#x27;m looking to answer the following questions:
 Is there any standard practice/convention for putting test data files? For JVM projects following Maven directory structure, the location is src/test/resources, but AFAICT, there&#x27;s no such convention in Haskell. So, putting the files inside the test directory, presumably under the same module path, makes sense to me.
 For example, If the code under test is in the module A.B, then putting the test data in the directory test/A/B is fine. If using HSpec, the test module is A.BSpec.
 How to read the test data files? There&#x27;s no need to list these files in the cabal file, because these are&#x27;t going to be shipped with the package. Simple readFile test/A/B/file.txt from the test works.
 Can anyone please confirm/correct the above statements?

                              <span>We all know that Scala is losing ground. But I still haven&#x27;t seen the reasons why clearly formulated. I think the best people to answer this question would be the people who have stopped using Scala.
 Questions to those people: 1. Why have you stopped using Scala, or Why are you planning to stop? 2. How much Scala experience do you have? What stack were you using? 3. What would make you come back, or Is there anything that would make you change your mind? 4. One suggestion for improvement. 
 People who are not using Scala may not be on this sub anymore. But in case some are still lurking, it would be great to hear their opinion.
 Please feel free to speak your mind. All answers from former devs are welcome.
 In case you want to share your thoughts anonymously, you can do it via this google form. I will share all the responses in a thread.
 Scala is very close to my heart as long time Scala dev myself. I think knowing why people are leaving + suggestions will really help. Thanks everyone for your input.

                              <span>I have a very long table that is over a page in length. I&#x27;ve looked and I can&#x27;t find a working method to export my .org file into pdf so the table automatically splits where necessary within the pdf. People say to use the long table package but when I include something like &quot;#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable :align |p{7cm}|l|l|&quot; nothing happens. 
 Also, how do I change the table width? I couldn&#x27;t find a good explanation either :/
 Sorry if these are stupid questions, I&#x27;m new.

                              <span>The manual pages are quite concise and do not really explain what&#x27;s happening under the hood. I&#x27;d like to try it out myself but I have no iOS device and the Android app of MobileOrg is unmantained with neither Dav/SDcard/SSH sync methods that seem to work.
 What I&#x27;d like to know is what&#x27;s the format of org-mobile-capture-file (mobileorg.org by default). It appears to me that it does not only contain capture headlines which will be blindly appended to the staging area, but it may also contain some rows that encode some edit events to existing headlines that will be applied when org-mobile-pull is invoked. If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d like to see some concrete instances of mobileorg.org files as an example, if anybody has time to satisfy this little whim of mine.
 Thank you in advance

                              <span>​ This is a modified version of the answer provided here 
 It replaces for spaces the colons in tags.
 ;; Hide colons in tags of org mode heading (font-lock-add-keywords &#x27;org-mode ;; Match tree things, ;; group 0 the heading and tags ;; group 1 the colons outside with everything in between ;; group 2 the inside of the outised colons &#x27;((&quot;^\\*+ \\(?:.*[ ]\\)?\\(:\\([[:alnum:]_@#%:]+\\):\\)[ ]*$&quot; ;; The previous regex was the ancher, this is the real hightlight &quot;:&quot; ;; Skip the heading. Go to the beginning of tags. Which is group 1 ;; If you return a point, this will become ;; the limit. So moving and return a point ;; (using save excursion) will enclose a ;; region in which to apply the regex (goto-char (match-beginning 1)) nil ;; After matching all : at position declared in pre-form. ;; Put facade (no better word, since it&#x27;s so bad) to colons (0 (put-text-property (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0) &#x27;display &quot; &quot;))))) 
 Example of the result:

                              <span>Haskell is a wonderful programming language. Personally, I&#x27;ve never had the opportunity to write anything meaningful in it. 
 I don&#x27;t see the use of this language in my daily work. 
 That&#x27;s why I wanted to ask you what you use this language for most often? I&#x27;m not asking about big business projects, but about smaller applications that you create in this language. 
 Thank you very much for all your answers.

                              <span>Clearly, this is probably related to language syntax, or compiler-related requirements, or something about how Haskell is forced to deal with abstraction. But why is it so? Why is it that Contravariant doesn&#x27;t instantiate Functor? On a superficial level, given Haskell&#x27;s definition of Contravariant and contramap, obviously there don&#x27;t correspond to fmap&#x27;s type signature. But why are we forced to define Contravariant in this way? In category theory, there&#x27;s no doubt that contravariant functors are functors. Does anyone have an explanation?

                              <span>Hello folks,
 First timer here. I&#x27;m currently learning Haskell, and I&#x27;m practicing doing the Advent of Code 2023.
 I&#x27;m a bit struggling with the performance of my solution for 2023 day 6, part 2.
 At first, here&#x27;s the solution I did a month ago in Go: main.go. Basically, I iterate from 1 to raceTime, and count the number of times where applying a function is bigger than a specific value. Note that raceTime can be pretty big (in my case it&#x27;s 55826490). The result is executed in a few milliseconds.
 I did the same in Haskell: Main.hs:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; numberOfWays :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int numberOfWays time distance &#x3D; foldl&#x27; (\acc i -&gt; acc + (travelDistance i time distance)) 0 [1 .. (time - 1)]
 travelDistance :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int travelDistance hold raceTime distance &#x3D; if (raceTime - hold) * hold &gt; distance then 1 else 0 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 At first, I used fold and I had a stack overflow. I read here and there what the issue was so I switched to foldl&#x27;. Yet, this version runs in more than 20 seconds compared to only a few milliseconds in Go.
 I&#x27;m not at all comparing Haskell and Go, but I&#x27;m trying to understand what makes my solution so slow and how to improve it. Note that I have seen versions in O(1), fair enough but I don&#x27;t want to implement a solution with better time complexity. I&#x27;d like to stick with an O(n) solution for now, to understand what I&#x27;m doing wrong.
 Thanks for the help.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs. I want to see if I can reduce some of its memory usage by disabling stuff I don&#x27;t use. Removal would be even better so I can save disk space too but it seems to be a too complicated task to be worth it. I asked ChatGPT what to put in my &quot;_emacs&quot; file in &quot;C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\_emacs&quot;, and these expressions don&#x27;t seem to do anything, I&#x27;m still able to open calendar, mail, games, etc.
 (setq gnus-init-file nil) (setq gnus-novice-user nil) (setq calendar-load-hook nil) (setq mark-diary-entries-in-calendar nil) (setq tramp-mode nil) (desktop-save-mode -1) (setq org-startup-folded nil) (setq zone-which-screen nil) 
 Are these expressions out of date for this version, am I putting it in the wrong file, am I misunderstanding Lisp, or do they not actually disable them? Other expressions like turning off autosave, changing font and background colors, turning off cursor blink, turning off the bell/error sound and replacing it with visible-bell and so on seem to work.

 At some point over the past couple of months Magit was updated to depend on a version of Transient that is greater than the one packaged by Emacs 29.1. This is accompanied by an error message with simple instructions on how to manually upgrade transient and fix the issue:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Emergency (magit): Magit requires ‘transient’ &gt;&#x3D; 0.5.0, but due to bad defaults, Emacs’ package manager, refuses to upgrade this and other built-in packages to higher releases from GNU Elpa.
 To fix this, you have to add this to your init file:
 (setq package-install-upgrade-built-in t)
 Then evaluate that expression by placing the cursor after it and typing C-x C-e.

 I need config for intuitive sidebar with list of files and symbols. I suspect others already done this before, as it&#x27;s kind of a standard IDE thing to show files and symbols on the sidebar. 
 What I need is: 
  
Show symbols of current selected buffer, if buffer changes, update the symbols automatically
 Open and close sidebar with single shortcut
  
​
 How can I achieve this?

I&#x27;ve done a bit of research and have pdf tools set up to view and read the pdf. I&#x27;ve seen suggestions for using pdf tools annotations and org-mode. I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of talk about texinfo. 
 If you wanted to take diligent notes with references, highlighting, bookmarks, tags, that kind of thing. What&#x27;s your approach? What is the emacs way?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to use org-drill to memorize the Mnemonic Association System. The thing is that if I try to review all 99 associations, I&#x27;m pretty much not going to remember anything. It&#x27;s a lot more manageable if I limit it to the first ten and then work my way up from there. Is there any way to do this other than remover the :drill: tags from the last 90 associations, and then adding it as I work my way through?

                              <span>hi all, I&#x27;m going through the elisp tutorial book. I got to the exercise to write an interactive function that doubles a parameter but have hit a stumbling block
 (defun double-param (number) (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (* number 2)) 
 This is the function I wrote. After running C-x C-e after the function (unlike without interactive) I can use M-x double-param but after hitting return it does not wait for input for the parameter. It simply exits with nothing in the echo area. Similarly I cannot use C-u 3 M-x double-param to send it the parameter. However, it still works if I call it with (double-param 3) for example I&#x27;ll see 6 *#o6, #x6, ?\C-f) in the echo area.
 What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;m guessing my understanding of what the &quot;p&quot; character modifier to interactive is wrong. Is there a different character to pass to interactive that will behave correctly?

                              <span>Hello,
 I know this question has been asked over and over again, but after reading many articles on this topic, as well as blog posts, orgmode tutorials, and trying a bit on my own, I&#x27;m still not sure orgmode fits my needs. Since the orgmode learning curve comes up a lot, I want to make sure it&#x27;s worth my time. 
 I&#x27;m a graduate student in applied mathematics. I&#x27;m just starting my master&#x27;s degree, so I&#x27;m looking to set up my workflow for classes, research and personal projects. I&#x27;d like to be able to quickly and easily create notes on articles, or textbooks, keeping a journal, organize files into projects, create to-do lists and roadmaps (much like orgmode does perfectly if I&#x27;ve understood what I&#x27;ve read correctly).
 I&#x27;ve never used emacs in my life and I don&#x27;t come from a computer science background --&gt; I find it very difficult to learn and I have the impression that it will be a long time before I can start using it for real. 
 People keep saying that it&#x27;s worth learning emacs and orgmode nonetheless because of the unlimited customization possibilities. What are your thoughts on this? 
 Should I be patient and learn to use emacs and orgmode to set up my workflow, or should I just start using Notion or any other simple organization and note-taking app? 
 Note that I don&#x27;t want a complex setup in the long run, just something minimalist that allows me to concentrate on what&#x27;s important while having a clear vision of my work.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 I am new to emacs, sorry if the question is too basic.
 ​
 I reached a point where I have a very useful setting for teaching statistics in orgmode + ess, however I worry about being able to make students have the same settings as my orgmode settings. This is required for, for example, connect to the uni&#x27;s ssh with tramp.
 ​
 Does anyone figured out a way of sharing their emacs conf in a single org file and ask collaborators to load the configurations in a single line of code (like the below, but for a org file)?
 ​
 emacs -q -L file.el

 I know that this can probably be done using https://github.com/fthomas/refined but I am not sure how. I would appreciate any help :)

                              <span>Hi all!
 I&#x27;m currently working with a scala codebase on a REST API that I did not design with the following stack : Scala 2 + Play Framework + Silhouette + Slick (and some Akka actors but I don&#x27;t think it is relevant here).
 My client (who is administrator on the platform being developed for his own company) got used to login as other users before I enforced some well needed security developments regarding passwords. Long story short was: he created the users with their password so he knew their authentication infos and was able to login in order to &quot;see what they can see&quot;, &quot;check for missing features directly on their account&quot;, &quot;test out that some specific features would really work for them&quot; in production, etc.
 But! I changed the way users are created, mainly because the passwords he created were way too easy to guess (without even having to brute force, litteraly everyone could guess the passwords, that&#x27;s why he could remember them in the first place).
 So he can&#x27;t login as other users anymore, and he would like to be able to &quot;do it again&quot;. I already worked on a platform that allowed user impersonation for administrators out of the box but I can&#x27;t find anything on the internet regarding this subject on the Play framework and Scala documentations or their communities...
 So my questions for you are: have you ever had to deal with an impersonation feature request using silhouette + play framework + scala and if you haven&#x27;t, do you have any advice to provide on the subject anyway? &#x3D;D
 Thanks very much for those who take the time to respond!
 EDIT: added essential politeness to my post

                              <span>For those who, like me, have to share their days between Emacs and one of IDEA&#x27;s IntelliJ-based products, I recently published the first version of an IntelliJ plugin called EmacsJ. It could perhaps be of interest for some people here. While the Emacs keymap in IntelliJ is actually pretty good, there&#x27;s enough differences that my Emacs-marinated fingers stumble too often while using IntelliJ. So the plugin is meant to be an extension of the existing Emacs functionality, offering around 40 commands that either modify existing IntelliJ commands to be closer to Emacs, or are pure additions to the IntelliJ commands.
 The plugin only makes these commands available, and you can use whichever ones you find useful, either by adding keybindings one-by-one, or by using the EmacsJ keymap installed by the plugin which is an extension of the Emacs keymap and activates all the commands at once.
 The main features are:
  
Incremental search modelled on Emacs&#x27; Isearch, with text and regexp search.
 Query-replace as in Emacs with text or regexps, with a very light-weight interface.
 Word commands: transpose, upper-case, lower-case, capitalize, move, delete.
 Rectangle commands: copy, open, clear, paste.
 Whitespace commands: delete space around point, delete empty lines.
 Easy access to clipboard history à la Emacs (kill ring).
 A mark history with ability to pop mark (mark ring), and exchange point and mark.
 Duplicate and comment regions and lines.
 Recenter and relocate caret.
 Zap to character.
  
​
 The plugin is of course free and open source.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am trying to dive back into emacs after installing nix, ensuring some reproducibility. 
 After starting prog-mode in the scratch buffer, the letters &quot;C-x C-f&quot; were highlighted beautifully. After some digging I found that they are the output of the function &quot;substitute-command-keys&quot; 
 I was playing around with it and tried to evaluate (substitute-command-keys &quot;String \\[abort-recursive-edit]&quot;). This gave me the output #(&quot;String C-]&quot; 7 10 (font-lock-face help-key-binding face help-key-binding)) 
 My question is, how can I get the output displayed with the &quot;help-key-binding&quot; face applied to &quot;C-]&quot; 
 Thanks,

                              <span>Hello all. I&#x27;ve been working as a Scala Backend Developer for the last 5 years. As some may know, the Job Market is really tough for Scala positions now. But I&#x27;ve come across some Data Engineering positions that accept Scala as previous experience. However, the recruiters dismiss me on the spot when reading my Resume. 
 Usually, the job description describes the tooling required, such as Airflow, Spark, Flinck, etc. I have some previous experience with Spark and Hadoop. But somehow it seems insufficient to start a conversation. 
 Can anyone provide me with some hints on how to start this focus shift from Development to Data Engineering?

                              <span>I&#x27;m starting with ZIO Http, in the past I used Akka Http, Play, and Http4s.
 So, I visited the official site on github: https://github.com/zio/zio-http
 Latest version is 3.0.0.RC4 ... so I will skip version 3 for the moment.
 Therefore I will try previous version of ZIO Http .... but in maven repository (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/dev.zio/zio-http) there are no version 2 or version 1 ... jumps from 0.0.5 to 3.0.0-RCx ...
 Where are versions 2 and 1? In github official site I see the following:
 NOTES ON VERSIONING:
  
Older library versions 1.x or 2.x with organization io.d11 of ZIO Http are derived from Dream11, the organization that donated ZIO Http to the ZIO organization in 2022.
 Newer library versions, starting in 2023 and resulting from the ZIO organization (dev.zio) started with 0.0.x, reaching 1.0.0 release candidates in April of 2023
  
Check in maven repository, search for &quot;io.d11&quot; (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.d11/zhttp) but all versions 1 and 2 are &quot;RC&quot; ...
 ​
 So I&#x27;m kind of lost ...
 - I don&#x27;t want to use version 3 because latest version is &quot;RC&quot;
 - But I&#x27;m not able to find versions 2 or 1 ...
 ​
 Am I doing something wrong when searching versions?
 Any suggestion?

                              <span>Hey there!
 I&#x27;ve upgraded my personal project to use Scala 3 (precisely Scala 3.3.1).I&#x27;d like to take advantage of opaque types, though, even if Doobie is in the latest version that seems to support Scala 3, it doesn&#x27;t know how decode the opaque type into a String, ZonedDateTime or any other reference/composite type (works with primitive types) when using the type in a Fragment or Sql interpolator e.g. in an Insert query.
 Found: (price : com.marryfied.bandservice.domain.model.Band.Price) Required: doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment[?] band &lt;- sql&quot;insert into bands (name, price, address_id, created, updated) VALUES ($x, $price, $addressId, $created, $updated)&quot; Found: (name : com.marryfied.bandservice.domain.model.Band.Name) Required: doobie.syntax.SqlInterpolator.SingleFragment[?] val updateBandQuery &#x3D; sql&quot;update bands SET name &#x3D; $name, price &#x3D; $price, updated &#x3D; $updated where id &#x3D; $id&quot; 
 https://preview.redd.it/pn49n2i8jpbc1.png?width&#x3D;1331&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;dd4da6a95822f25587ef5e25cab06ff58c04209e
 Here&#x27;s the gist: https://gist.github.com/wjoz/b88d206826501ce3bf6915508e17613a (Look at PostgresBandRepository) 
 Is there any possibility to define custom mappings so Doobie knows to treat an opaque type e.g. Name or Price like a concrete implementation e.g. a String and decode it properly? 
 I also may be doing something wrong, so any help in figuring it out is highly appreciated :) 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Simple question: what do you guys consider more readable?
 data Foo &#x3D; Bar | Baz projToBool :: Foo -&gt; Bool projToBool &#x3D; \case Bar -&gt; True Baz -&gt; False projToBool&#x27; :: Foo -&gt; Bool projToBool&#x27; Bar &#x3D; True projToBool&#x27; Baz &#x3D; False 
 I tend to prefer the first style, as it seems to me more clear that I&#x27;m defining a function with two cases (or n cases in general). But I&#x27;ve started to guess if the second would be better. What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Hello all!
 Super quick question. I love building ghc cross compilers, but I am struggling a bit since the switch to Hadrian. I can’t find enough information on the process to understand it. E.g. what is the role of the configure script now? Do build.mk options do anything?
 Has anyone got either an overview of this, or alternatively some scripts to cross build ghc that I can study?
 All the best!
 Bonus Question: can you still bootstrap ghc from .hc files? I’m wanting to port GHC to 9front and I a cross c toolchain looks like a pain.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a project and we decided to use Azure Databricks and Scala.
 I&#x27;m fairly new to Scala and I was trying to find working examples online on how to setup a build.sbt file and build jars that I can deploy. Does anyone have experience with Databricks and Scala and can assist me how to setup a project properly. Basically all I want is one folder with multiple projects that stores all my pipelines, 1 commons project that sets up databricks configs and being able to build all projects into individual jar files. Has anyone attempted this or is there a better way to structure it? Should I use sbt-typelevel to create my project?

                              <span>Hi, I have a multi module project which has unit tests. I created a new task for integration tests. My goal is to run all unit tests in all modules followed by integration tests (only if all UTs pass). It doesn’t make sense to run ITs if any of the UTs fail! I tried using gradle task rules - mustRanAfter, shouldRanAter and DependsOn, all seem to apply the rule within each individual module but not across the whole project.
 Is it even possible to run all UTs across all modules and then trigger a new task with gradle build? Thanks!
 Module1: UT1 (under src/test/scala) IT1 (under sec/it/scala)
 Module2: UT2 (under src/test/scala) IT2 (under sec/it/scala)
 Goal: UT1 UT2 Anyother UTs (complete running all UTs) IT1 IT2

                              <span>I&#x27;m running Emacs 29 (zero config &#x60;-Q&#x60;) on WSL2 Ubuntu distro.
 I have &#x60;texlive-latex-extra&#x60; and &#x60;dvipng&#x60; installed.
 I have a problem with previewing a latex fragment in org file.
 Example org file
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 $\overline{A} + B$
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Running &#x60;org-latex-preview&#x60; on this fragment outputs an error &quot;Arithmetic overflow error&quot;.
 However, when I run this command on my linux machine (also Ubuntu with all packages installed), it outputs the preview image correctly.
 ​
 Has anybody figured how to make latex--preview work on WSL?

 Does someone can confirm that notmuch search --query&#x3D;sexp --format&#x3D;sexp &#x27;(not (tag myfancytag))&#x27; is not a legal query for notmuch ?
 The doc does not explicitly clarify this case.
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m using elpaca with use-package. Basically, magit requires transient and installing transient fails with &quot;Requires seq minimum version: 2.24&quot;. From searching online, seq should be build in and be Version 2.24 since quiet some time. I also don&#x27;t remember ever running into issues with this in the past.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I work using a local emacs instance running on my Mac and ssh to a remote machine. The two do not share a filesystem - i.e. any server files created on the Mac won&#x27;t be immediately visiable on the remote. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to call emacsclient on the remote and have that open a frame on the local emacs instance. This used to work for the longest time (by accident?). I was recently noodling with my setup and suddenly it no longer works :) 
 I&#x27;ve been attempting to do the following from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/emacsclient-Options.html : 
 local$ ssh -R12345:localhost:12345 remote 
 remote$ export EDITOR&#x3D;&quot;emacsclient \
 --server-file&#x3D;server \ 
 --tramp&#x3D;/ssh:remote:&quot; remote$ $EDITOR /tmp/foo.txt #Should open in local emacs.
 where I&#x27;ve copied the server file (from local Mac to remote) just ahead of trying.
 ​
 Any tips on how to get this work again? Quite a big part of my flow and hate having to use $EDITOR&#x3D;vim on the remove :D

                              <span>Hello! As a new Emacs user, it seems that I have joined in exciting times with the adoption of treesitter + LSP (which also was my setup in neovim). I have spent some time customizing and slowly get the hang of how minor/major modes work.
 From what I saw, a major mode defines syntax rules for highlighting (similar to treesitter), on-the-fly error checking with flycheck (similar to LSP) and some setup, such as indentation, etc.
 I understand that TS + LSP are still being actively developed and integrated into Emacs and so I accept that the experience using these tools might not yet match that of established major modes. So I am mostly curious about the future.
 If you were to start coding in a new language in Emacs, what would your setup look like? My thinking is to install the treesitter grammar and the LSP plus minor modes for navigation and editing (e.g., lispy for elisp). Would TS + LSP be used instead of the language major mode or in conjunction with said major mode?

                              <span>I frequently open two files from the command lines. e.g. emacs file_a file_b. Emacs opens a split window where file_b is in the left window and file_a is in the right window. Without issuing a command to swap the two windows, is there a setting that will cause emacs to open the file_a file in the left window and file_b in the right window? The convention that emacs uses appears to make the last file specified on the command line as the main buffer (which is the left window in my case).

 I want to switch to the workflow of org-gtd. I would like integrate org-gtd workflow to my current data. Its todo keywords is (sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;NEXT(n)&quot; &quot;WAIT(w@)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot; &quot;CANCEL&quot;). 
 I think I should convert all FAIL to DONE in all org file. Else (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) will not filter FAIL tasks.
 How migrate org-todo-keywords in org file of my org-agenda when change workflow?
 Its is possible to share your elisp function for the migration?

I have a large collection of papers saved on my drive which I can&#x27;t use because I have no way to keep track of them. Does anyone have an emacs solution that will allow me to make brief notes as to what&#x27;s in the pile, maybe tag them by subject areas and priority to read, represent how they relate to each other, and so on?

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 I am using Org Mode while learning about Guix via the fabulous Dissecting Guix series, employing Code blocks to visualize what it is I am talking about. However, I noticed two things that REALLY bug me out.
 First off, when I load the org file containing said source blocks, it is slow to the point of unusability UNLESS I first start GEISER-CONNECT with an instance of GUIX REPL hooked up. This leads me to believe that it is independent of org mode and has to do with the fact that it searches for the code to which the blocks reference. Nonetheless, input on this is highly appreciated
 Second, when I use TAB (for org-cycle), I am asked for the currently used scheme implementation - despite the fact that both related geiser variables, geiser-active-implementation and geiser-default-implementation only contain guile. When I choose guile, then the source block contents become read-only, and all subsequent editing needs to happen in a separate Org Src buffer. I have no clue why this is the case.
 I have come to the point where I commented out all code blocks to not have to deal with it, which is obviously not acceptable in the long run. Thus, any input is appreciated :)
 Have a good day, fellows!
 EDIT/SOLVED: I found out the source of the problem. At one point I had opened a lot of files related to Guix and then saved the Desktop file. Then, loading the file would load all those other files including all modes related. For some reason I don&#x27;t quite understand this literally ground emacs to a halt performance-wise.

 For example, the following is what I get using consult-imenu (which appears to give the same menu with plain imenu, just flattened):
 https://preview.redd.it/clcpn54xphbc1.png?width&#x3D;707&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a722e75dfca64c6f2a2aacfd414df16a7a0d8882
 In this case, I cannot jump to &quot;1 Introduction&quot;, &quot;2 The Way of Emacs&quot;, or any other non-leaf nodes like &quot;Guiding Philosophy&quot;.
 Is there any way to configure imenu so that an item gets created for those inner, non-leaf nodes?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started using lsp-bridge after months of fighting with eglot and lsp-mode. Both eglot and lsp-mode are great projects, but they have their quirks, and for me, most of them revolve around how slow and how prone to timing out they are, as well as the massive memory footprint that they cause (I&#x27;ve had both of them spawn clangd processes that end up consuming 20-30GB, and so far lsp-bridge is keeping under 10GB, which is fine). This isn&#x27;t their fault per se--I&#x27;m working on an Unreal Engine project and there is just so much going on all the time, and I can easily believe that parsing JSON is the bottleneck. (I know there&#x27;s a new-ish project that tries to solve that problem for lsp-mode, and I will definitely try that one day if this experiment with lsp-bridge doesn&#x27;t work out.)
 So, two questions:
  
Can I jump to the (header) file under the cursor, or like lsp-mode, cause that header to become a link to the file?
 I have some functions and classes that seem inaccessible because they&#x27;re wrapped up in a namespace. This isn&#x27;t true of everything in a namespace, just a few things. That means I can&#x27;t jump to classes/functions defined in that namespace, and I also get no completion information back. This wasn&#x27;t the case with eglot or lsp-mode, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fundamental limitation of clangd.
  
Other than that, so far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I&#x27;ll work out some keybindings and wrapper functions to see if I can get the functionality that I&#x27;m missing, but for jumping around the code, it&#x27;s significantly more performant.

                              <span>Lately I&#x27;ve noticed that new frames (e.g., created with emacsclient -nc) don&#x27;t come to the front with keyboard focus on them. I&#x27;m now on Mac OSX 14.2.1 (Sonoma), but I think it started happening before Sonoma upgrade. This behavior also shows with other programmatic ways of getting new frames (make-frame, yequake, etc.)
 Has anyone else noticed it, or solved it hopefully? 
 I&#x27;m up to date on osx (14.2.1 Sonoma) and emacs:

                              <span>An elisp question. I have lines in my nnmail-split-methods using rx like this:
 (&quot;mail.git&quot; (rx bol (or &quot;From&quot; &quot;To&quot; &quot;Cc&quot; &quot;Resent-From&quot;) &quot;:&quot; (* anything) (or &quot;@github.com&quot; &quot;@gitlab.com&quot; &quot;@pdfbox.apache.org&quot;))) (&quot;mail.pro&quot; &quot;\\(^From\\|^Cc\\|^To\\|^Resent-From\\):.*\\(me@mine.com\\|@example.com\\)&quot;) (&quot;mail.hummon&quot; &quot;\\(^From\\|^Cc\\|^To\\|^Resent-From\\):.*\\(thing@example2.com\\)&quot;) 
 The first line, with &quot;mail.git&quot;, is the form I would like these things to be. I cringe at the repetition in each of them as I have the same headers bit that I want to replace with the (rx bol (or ...)) bit everywhere. But I can&#x27;t figure out the syntax to generalize that. In Clojure I could whip up a little let-bound function and use into to pull it off; what is the elisp solution to being able to stick the same rx code inline everywhere? I&#x27;m imagining (rx headers (* anything).

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get a nice setup for LaTeX/Overleaf rolling, and I really like how GhostText and atomic-chrome let me just edit my browser Overleaf live rather than worrying about keeping a local git repo up-to-date with collaborators&#x27; changes. I was wondering if there&#x27;s any way to get citar working with this setup though?
 At the moment whenever I use M-x citar-insert-citation in a LaTeX buffer using atomic-chrome, I get the message &quot;RefTeX works only in buffers visiting a file&quot;. That seems conclusively like a dead-end to me, but this old comment from /u/T_Verron does imply that it is possible. (it also implies my setup might not work so well for collaborative editing as I thought it would, but I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that things have improved in the last two years)
 Can anyone point me in the right direction on a possible workaround? Thanks!

 # Local Variables: # org-confirm-babel-evaluate: nil # End: 
 However, when I first edit this file, Emacs asks me to confirm that I want to set this file-local variable, and I&#x27;d like it not to.
 This is a dangerous variable, so I don&#x27;t want to just add (org-confirm-babel-evaluate . nil) to my safe-local-variable-values, because then any file would run its code blocks without asking me.
 I thought of putting org-confirm-babel-evaluate in a .dir-locals.el file, but now I get asked whether I want to set it when .dir-locals.el is loaded, rather than when my org file is loaded.
 I also thought of setting the safe-local-variable property on…</span>

                              <span>I am using Emacs 29.1.90 built from source with eglot and racket-langserver and any attempt to use LSP features results in an error message like the following:
 eglot--error: [eglot] Unsupported or ignored LSP capability &#x60;:implementationProvider&#x27; 
 The particular capability varies with what I am trying to do, but in short, even though I can connect to racket-langserver, any attempt to use eglot cross-reference features results in an error message like that above with each of the capabilities. I am using a vanilla configuration based on Emacs Bedrock. The pertinent parts of my config are here
 (use-package racket-mode :ensure t) (use-package eglot :hook (((c-mode c++-mode python-mode elixir-mode gleam-ts-mode racket-mode) . eglot-ensure)) :custom (eglot-send-changes-idle-time 0.1) :bind-keymap (&quot;C-c l&quot; . eglot-mode-map) :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;a&quot; . eglot-code-actions) (&quot;r&quot; . eglot-rename) (&quot;h&quot; . eldoc) (&quot;f&quot; . eglot-format) (&quot;F&quot; . eglot-format-buffer) (&quot;d&quot; . xref-find-definitions-at-mouse) (&quot;D&quot; . eglot-find-declaration) (&quot;i&quot; . eglot-find-implementation))) 
 I&#x27;ve checked the eglot events buffer and don&#x27;t see any requests going out. The only message I get back is the error mentioned above.
 This happens to me in Racket, but I&#x27;ve seen the same problem in other languages like Elixir. I should note that these features do work with other editors/LSP clients like Neovim and Doom Emacs. Am I missing some crucial configuration?

                              <span>Often times people here ask questions without formatting their code properly, which makes it a pain to read it.
 I mean, if you are not able to switch to markdown mode and use &#x60; and &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; or four spaces, how should you then be able to learn Haskell?
 I think there should be a rule requiring properly formatted code.
 What do you think?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Haskell and I find the syntax really off-putting (I am an experienced developer in Java/JavaScript/Typescript)
 One thing I don&#x27;t like most is there is no parentheses and comma in function calls. When a line contains several function calls with each having more than one arguments, your brain will be burdened to identify the &quot;parse tree&quot;, while in popular languages the parentheses will save you this effort.
 I don&#x27;t think there is mathematics base for this kind of designation. You can argue this is concise or elegant. I may also think the same way if I stick to Haskell for a while. But I&#x27;m afraid this can be one of the reasons Haskell has not been more popular - a developer from another language with passion of FP comes here, only to find he can&#x27;t tolerate the syntax and finally leaves for other FPs. :-)

                              <span>Scala 3 is a nicer language, but the Intellij Idea works much better in Scala 2 which is a huge factor for my productivity.
 Which would you pick for a greenfield project and why?

                              <span>Hi all -- I am experiencing an issue with the org-capture functionality. I use doom, and after my most recent upgrade &amp; sync when I invoke org-capture and org-roam-capture, the capture buffer (which prompts with [t] for todo, [n] for note, etc) now overwrites whatever buffer I&#x27;m working in, rather than creating a minibuffer to handle the capture. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to respect the custom capture prompts that I have attempted to shamelessly copypaste from a blog configure. Thankfully it&#x27;s not a fatal issue since a single undo restores the contents of the buffer but it&#x27;s very strange and annoying! Has anyone else experienced this issue or perhaps know of a fix? Snippets from my config.el pertaining to the aforementioned functions below. All help appreciated and thank you in advance!

 emacs-lisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;x&quot; &quot;Work testing&quot; agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-tag-filter &quot;-home&quot;)))) 
 but I still see entries with :home: as tags. What am I doing wrong here? I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good example of this.

                              <span>I followed this guide for using LaTeX with emacs, and I added snippets to my emacs configuration. The snippets are here along with my emacs config here.
 For some reason, when my snippets activate (either automatically or with tab completion) a new line is inserted after the snippet. As a result, my documents become very hard to read very quickly. The GIFs in the guide didn&#x27;t have this issue, so I was wondering if anyone here could point me in the right direction.

 (setq eat-enable-yank-to-terminal t)
 I&#x27;ve tried char-mode; semi-char-mode; line-mode. Text does get yanked into the buffer, but eat doesn&#x27;t do anything with it. It doesn&#x27;t fontify, the cursor remains in place, I can&#x27;t edit the text, it won&#x27;t be processed as a terminal command. After pressing ENTER, the yanked text moves to the next line with the cursor, but remains useless.
 What am I doing wrong here?
 (I&#x27;m using EXWM, if that matters!)
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get yasnippet snippets to show among the completion candidates in company-mode&#x27;s popup. I have tried to read the manual and to look around for similar problems on forums/stackoverflow, but I can&#x27;t find a way to make it work properly.
 I have tried to put this, which I found here in my config: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; emacs-lisp (defvar company-mode/enable-yas t &quot;Enable yasnippet for all backends.&quot;)
 (defun company-mode/backend-with-yas (backend) (if (or (not company-mode/enable-yas) (and (listp backend) (member &#x27;company-yasnippet backend))) backend (append (if (consp backend) backend (list backend)) &#x27;(:with company-yasnippet))))
 (setq company-backends (mapcar #&#x27;company-mode/backend-with-yas company-backends)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; and i tried to put this
 emacs-lisp (setq company-backends &#x27;((company-bbdb :with company-yasnippet company-semantic :with company-yasnippet company-cmake :with company-yasnippet company-capf :with company-yasnippet company-clang :with company-yasnippet company-files :with company-yasnippet (company-dabbrev-code :with company-yasnippet company-gtags :with company-yasnippet company-etags :with company-yasnippet company-keywords :with company-yasnippet) company-oddmouse :with company-yasnippet company-dabbrev :with company-yasnippet))) 
 I wrote the former based on what I have read in the docs here, but it still does not work as expected.
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 27.1 on a Pop!_Os system. Can anyone help me figure this out?

                              <span>Maybe this defeats the point of tags etc., but I often want to narrow down a search based on what&#x27;s in the content of the entry (which maybe a blogpost or the transcript of a YouTube video). 
 I think elfeed-score can access this data in order to rank posts. I would for instance like to use this to score elfeed entries based on the length of their content (e.g. shorter posts ranked higher), but I haven&#x27;t quite been able to sort this out.
 But more generally, is there a package that can search through the entry content? I don&#x27;t think Elfeed alone allows this, but I&#x27;d be happy to be corrected.

                              <span>So, mostly just looking for some tips on how to debug this and maybe figure out the issue, as I have no clue how to reproduce this (and can barely even interact with the bug myself!), but anyway. Fwiw, I&#x27;ve been an emacs user for a decently long time now (~5-6 years at least?), I know how to write in lisp but I&#x27;m not overly acquainted with all the intricacies of the emacs environment.
 So some of the time when I go to save a buffer, I&#x27;m only greeted with the message Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: nil. At this point, saving buffers becomes basically impossible as it always errors out, however, I can usually manage by manually calling basic-save-buffer instead. The few times this bug has appeared, it feels like my client is gradually deteriorating as more and more functions succumb to…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a custom function for comint-output-filter-functions that uses some regex to find test failures. I would like to display details about the test failure in the buffer associated (if currently open). I use flymake for compiler errors, so that seems like a logical choice, but I&#x27;m open to others.
 How can I manually add errors to flymake or some other package? Is there a better alternative I should explore, like overlays or something?
 For context, I&#x27;m working with Elixir and output from mix test.

                              <span>I compile my Emacs from source, so I&#x27;m currently running 30.0.50.
 I then configure it using an Org-babel file.
 As a starting point, I&#x27;ve configured the Melpa repository. I then started to install Magit.
 The installation appears to complete without any errors, and I can initialise a Git repository using Magit without any problem. Staging files works too, but when it comes to commiting, I get an error which finishes:

 I&#x27;ve found a couple of references to others having a similar issue, but no solution listed, so before I contact the developers I thought I&#x27;d try Reddit.

                              <span>Soon I&#x27;ll probably be responsible for coding a compiler/VM for a language that targets WASM. And since haskell is such an amazing language for PL, I was wondering how the WASM experience is. 
  
Should I follow the gitlab user guide to wasm to get it going?
 Any tips, experiences, projects, or thoughts about things I should pay attention to?
 Any things that I should be worried about?

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
EDCI445 Young Adult Literature is about to start.
I&#x27;m studying techniques for capturing &quot;Idea Flurries.&quot;
Reviewing 2023 and setting intentions for 2024.



I&#x27;m trying hard to slow down to interrogate and chew my thinking thoroughly. He/She who dies with the most notes doesn&#x27;t win. The goal is a rich and fulfilling life.

“It matters less what you read,” he told me, emphasizing each word, “than how you take notes.” - from Rank and File — Real Life by Robert Minto Referenced to me from On a failed Zettelkasten by Robert Minto — Zettelkasten Forum three years ago.
Zettelkasting randomness and disorder, and how it is surprising that these lead to knowledge.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Parrish, Shane. Clear thinking: turning ordinary moments into extraordinary results. 2023.
Garmus, Bonnie. Lessons in chemistry. 2022.
Tucci, Stanley. Taste: my life through food. 2021.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Keith Jarrett
Lissie
Japari Park
Jazz,  Jazz, and more Jazz.

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>Hi everyone.
Most of my books at the moment are in digital formal (kindle) that I turn to pdf or EPUB using calibre. I want to start acquiring physical books but in the short term this is what I got.
I’m looking for an app that lets me highlight and add notes or comments to the highlights I made. Using the barbell method of reading I’d read the book twice and the highlights would have the purpose of being visual cues of what I found relevant and why.
There are three options I have found (MacOS): Highlights, Skim and PDF Expert.
Which software do you use and recommend? If you could expand a little bit on your workflow it would be great.
Thanks everyone.</span>

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
I am in the process of restructuring my training regimen to align it with the new role of fitness in my life. (You can have a badly translated version of my last article here)
I am building an inventory of training stimuli for that. I am doing something similar like a factor analysis. For many years, for example, my aerobic endurance (roughly, what you normally associate with endurance if you are not into sports science) training was distributed over many different other training sessions that you&#x27;d normally not associate with aerobic endurance. Like that I could skip long sessions of running, biking etc. and use that freed up time and energy for other training while still having a solid aerobic base (for recovery between bouts of intensity and between exercise sessions).
I thought that I&#x27;d create something similar for knowledge work. Examples are items like reading physical books, attributes like screen time (to highlight a benefit of physical books over ebooks) or requirements like daily empty time slots (like my dog walks in which I do nothing, but just listen to the sound of the world).
So, what should be considered?
Live long and prosper
Sascha</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m just trying to express a current problem in types. The code itself is in TypeScript, so I don&#x27;t want to flesh out the PS solution in much detail, just annotate it in types as readability and type inference is so much better in PS.
 Is there an analog to Haskells undefined or Elm&#x27;s Debug.todo, allowing me to skip implementing functions while keeping the compiler happy? I just found an older Github issue suggesting this, but maybe I&#x27;m using the wrong queries in the internet search?
 I think type holes is not really what I want, as it kind of goes the opposite way around, right?

 the problem is that when i mark the task as done. the other future task stay in DOING.
 is there a way to make them go back to TODO?

                              <span>tl;dr the title
 i am very new to emacs and org-mode. in fact i just finished watching the google talk by the creator.
 i found an app called Orgzly which seemed to work really well in the phone, and it even has a feature to set alarms. but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. 
 i put the time in the scheduling as well as in deadline but it seems to only triggers a notification.
 it&#x27;s not a deal breaker and i could see my self replacing all my Obsidian notes to org. but i was just hoping to trigger an alarm so that i can plan EVERY PART OF MY DAY 😭😌
 thanks for the great software, and thanks for any help

                              <span>I often find myself reusing some code across various projects and thought it might be beneficial to share. 
 If you&#x27;re tackling the tedious task of modeling language or country concepts and you&#x27;re already utilising the Enumeratum library in your project, I&#x27;d suggest considering these two libraries: scala-iso-language and scala-iso-country. 
 They offer a minimalist and standardized approach and have some translation capabilities.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a MBP 2019 16&quot; Intel, 64GB, I9 and running Ventura 13.6.3.
 Intellij Idea is the latest version as of now, Build #IU-233.13135.103, built on December 19, 2023. I allocated max. 12GB to the VM running IntelliJ
 What I am experiencing?
 When I edit scala files in a small size Scala project (roughly 40 files, scala source code + few files generated from the play framework) using playframework 3 &amp; anorm, basically IntelliJ goes nuts, i.e. the CPU usage goes up, the fans rpm go to the maximum (I run TG Pro) to the point where I cannot type continuously - I keep typing, and the characters don&#x27;t show up for a few fractions of second, then they all appear at once. Clicking anywhere in the editor or in the user interface has a lag. I am using the default JDK that comes with IntelliJ. Cmd+Tab doesn&#x27;t respond immediately, or it is frozen for a moment then the selection moves quickly a few more icons to right.
 I tried VS Codium + Metals to edit the same project and it is more responsive but I don&#x27;t like it as much as IntelliJ.
 I also run a Windows 10 VM in desktop parallels and, believe it or not, I installed the same version of IntelliJ and it is more responsive than the mac version. I think I am going to continue on windows in the short term.
 I am just curious about few things if you don&#x27;t mind sharing your experience:
  
do you use Intellij on Linux and if yes, what is the performance like, assuming that you don&#x27;t run it on apple hardware?
 if you run IntelliJ on a newer mac with the apple CPU, what is the performance like?
 any suggestions/recommendations on how to improve the performance of IntelliJ on the mac?
  
And just a side note, because I read the MBP 2019 16&quot; intel has some problems handling external monitors, I should mention I do use an external 4K Dell monitor, but I do not experience the problems described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AlUmnVYPcKM .
 Thank you

                              <span>Google Summer of Code is a long-running program by Google that supports Open Source projects. Haskell has taken part in this program almost since its inception!
 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.
 You can find more info and instructions on how to participate here: https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html.

                              <span>please keep in mind that i’m very new to emacs and i&#x27;ve been using doom to get a feel for how emacs works, and thank’s in advance.
 so i just moved from neovim to emacs and loving it so far. but i’m having an issue configuring it to suit my workflow for python and django.
 so what i wanna do is replicate the workflow i’ve used in vim which is:
 configure pylsp with plugins pylsp-ruff and pylsp-mypy and then have isort and black handle formatting without lsp interference.
 and i also want to configure mypy globally in my config to check if there’s a (venv, poetry or conda) env active and and use that env’s python executable
 and bonus, if i could also get help setup a function to run django tests from emacs.
 i know my question seems like a tall order, but i’m really loving Emacs and doom and hope i could finally find a solution so that i’m able to stick with Emacs.

                              <span>One thing I&#x27;d like to do this year is to demonstrate various possibilities of using LLMs in Emacs. How are they actually useful in editors?
 In that light, I made a video showing how they are useful when taking notes. Specifically, I used ekg (my module in GNU ELPA) to come up with a way to get Aeropress recipes (Aeropress is, to me, kind of like the emacs of coffee brewing), and take notes how they taste. The video shows the entire process.

                              <span>I am currently testing PIKCHR, a modern take of the ancient PIC little language that generates diagram from textual input. PIKCHR outputs the diagrams as SVG files. However, when opening the files in Emacs (29.1, ) only an unfilled box (30x30 per mode-line information) is shown instead of the SVG files. Opening the same file in a browser (Brave), the diagram is shown. Also, when opening random SVG files found on the internet, they work perfectly in Emacs. Where to start finding the underlying issue?

 Because I am using GNU gettext I do have flake8 errors like this. I don&#x27;t want to put an extra flake8 config file into the repo.
 I don&#x27;t know how Emacs/eglo/pylsp do invoke flake8 in the back. Is there a way to inject &#x27;--builtins&#x3D;&quot;_&quot;&#x27; commandline option somewhere in there?
 *EDIT*: It seems that a &quot;.flake8&quot; file in the repos root folder is also ignored.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been running into this problem a lot: Ruff gives syntax error hints even though everything is correct. After &quot;M-x eglot-reconnect&quot;, everything goes back to normal again. Below is a screenshot.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/my9v4il29xac1.png?width&#x3D;291&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a10f27f546eaee001d6884fb4d82757245a396a2
 In this case, Ruff reports two errors that don&#x27;t exist: 1. ruff [E701]: Multiple statements on one line (colon) and 2. ruff [E999]: SyntaxError: Unexpected token Indent. &quot;M-x eglot-reconnect&quot; solves the problem.
 I want to report the problem but I&#x27;m not sure which component (Ruff, Flymake, Eglot, python-lsp-ruff or python-lsp) causes this problem. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know why but I am just having a really difficult time wrapping my head around the Emacs window manager. I can&#x27;t seem to translate what I have in my head into code, which is an unusual and frustrating experience for me.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is, when I&#x27;m specifically working on a Python project, have my frame set up so that there&#x27;s a main window with the buffer I&#x27;m working on, then to the right is a python REPL, and to the left is a switchable choice between an xrefs list and a directory tree. What I&#x27;d like to do is set up the position and sizing of all of these by mouse-dragging them to how I want them, then saving that configuration somehow. Then, crucially, having this configuration and sizing be entered when I visit a python buffer and python-mode launches, and exited back to &quot;normal&quot; emacs when I leave python-mode except in a couple of instances.
 Has anyone done something like this? If so, could you share your config? I don&#x27;t know what it is about Emacs&#x27;s window manager but each one of these requirements has so many moving pieces in different parts of the system that I just have trouble wrapping my head around the whole.

 At a single press of the F5 key -- or whatever you wish to make it too -- your project will be compiled. 
 I have examples for a number of languages -- Ruby, C++. Rust, Go -- but they are highly configurable and you can add your own.
 This works with your git projects. It will go to the root of your git project and execute the necessary commands to compile your entire project. Well documented with examples.
 If you hit the F6 key, you will be presented with the compile string that you can then edit on the fly.
 I should get this in Melpa. I tried a long while back, but the maintanier of Melpa insisted that I do a pull request instead with smart-compile, that schlau-compile is derived from. Except at that time I had made so many breaking changes a pull request would not have been feasible. And now? It has completely diverged, as I have added quite a few features and changed the workflow. It is its own project now, and I should approach Melpa again to include it separately.
 Let me know what you think!

 Let me know what kind of information would be useful to display in the org-ellipsis.
 I tried contents size (1) and first line of content (2). so, It looks like pretty good.
 sorry for my broken English. thank you for reading!

                              <span>I&#x27;m developing an experimental musical score writer. For now I&#x27;ve only been working on the internal representation, but I&#x27;d like to start prototyping the graphical aspect, which I&#x27;ve never done on haskell.
 I&#x27;m asking for recommendations on libraries to create an interactive canvas: basically, a window where I can draw/update the score and click on different elements in it, and also receive keyboard input. Not a GUI in the sense of menus, widgets or anything of the sort; just an interactive canvas. 
 Now, if memory doesn&#x27;t fail me:
 - the OpenGl bindings take mouse and keyboard events, but it&#x27;s perhaps too low level.
 - the Cairo bindings are nicer to work with, but to put them on an interactive screen some Gtk lib was needed; but even with that, would I only receive mouse click coordinates? I don&#x27;t mind writing some square object detection, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind a simpler route if there was.
 - ability to import svgs would make my life easier, probably.

                              <span>I&#x27;m gonna write a compiler for my language. I&#x27;m a haskell developer but I&#x27;m totaly new to compiler writing. Is haskell a good decision for compiler writing and why? Maybe I should use Rust for my compiler. Just try to find out some advantages and disadvantages of haskell in complier writing.

                              <span>There are so many aws api’s which are developed like for S3, Dynamodb etc. The aws platform support few languages like Java, python, rust, cpp, kotlin etc but no scala yet. Please share your experience if you are using scala in cloud , plain or fp flavor. I love scala and have been learning it for some time. The cloud is the next big thing where most of the development is happening now as the old apps are migrating from cobol/mainframes to cloud.

                              <span>Happy New Year!
I follow Sascha&#x27;s advice to use object tags: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/
In the following note, I have used the object tags: &quot;#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital&quot;.
I often encounter this situation where I want to refer to a specific entity (e.g. a good technician), so I use adjectives to be specific about it. But I don&#x27;t know if this is good practice. The other options I could use are:
use two tags: &quot;#good #technician&quot;.
use only the core of the idea: &quot;#technician&quot;.
What do you recommend me to do?
Because in this note, I just want to refer to good technicians (I don&#x27;t want to talk about technicians in general). Therefore, I think that&#x27;s the object to define with the tag. But I could be wrong :^)
# 202401060957 Turning a good technician into a mediocre boss destroys human capital
#good-technician #mediocre-boss #human-capital

In companies (public or private), one way to progress economically is to
acquire responsibility for the work of others: to move from being a technician
to being a boss.

However, the skills that define a good technician are different from those of
a good boss.

This causes many good technicians (motivated by economic incentives) to become
mediocre bosses: they do not have the skills needed to be good bosses.

For the company, this situation destroys human capital value: we have turned
a good technician into a mediocre boss.</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m interested in monitoring disk usage, one app to do this on Linux is IOtop.
 I checked to see if just like with the excellent proced process interface, there was an elisp implementation of something like IOtop, but I haven&#x27;t found any.
 Does this exist?
 Thank you!

I&#x27;ll post what I think are the relevant bits of init file code below. Note that org-tree-slide and org-drill functions are available when using M-x but org-ql and org-present functions are not.

 The only other things in my init.el file are use-package declarations and custom functions for keybinding and presentation display changes.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Been an emacs user for years, that said, I&#x27;ve barely touched elisp. Now, I want to update hyde.el to work on the latest emacs, and I&#x27;m having trouble the following part
 (defun hyde/load-posts () &quot;Load up the posts and present them to the user&quot; (interactive) ;; Clear the buffer (toggle-read-only -1) 
 It seems like (toggle-read-only) does not exist on emacs 29. Changing it to use (read-only-mode) makes emacs complain about the buffer being read only. 
 For what I can tell, I need to change the mode to read the read only and then inhibit it while I do some buffer manipulation. But these seems kind of elaborate for something that seems (to me) like common behaviour.
 Could anyone please comment on what the correct approach is to create a mode where a buffer displays data that is read only (and then have commands that do stuff on the data but mostly dont modifiy the buffer at all)?
 The code I&#x27;m trying to update is https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde/blob/master/hyde.el, more info on https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde/ with a relevant screenshot.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I am trying to get some color in an example block exported to beamer by doing something like the following
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE case when \textcolor{red}{condition-1 then value-1} when condition-2 then value-2 . . . when conditionn then value-n else value-z end #+END_EXAMPLE 
 According to this post on the tex stackexchange site, a verbatim enironment can get color by adding the commandchars argument, i.e.
 \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}] a (black) \textcolor{red}{b} (I want this letter to be red) \end{Verbatim} 
 Unfortunately I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get commandchars option set in the example block. I&#x27;ve tried adding a #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}] above the example block, modifying the begin example line as #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :options commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}, #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :commandchars \\\{\}, and #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :options [commandchars&#x3D;\\\{\}] and none of that has worked. How should I get color in my example block. Also, is there some reading material somewhere where I can find how to properly pass options/keywords/attributes to org-mode for exporting purposes. The org mode manual hasn&#x27;t exactly made a lot of sense to me.

                              <span>This post will not probably have enough information for troubleshooting, but the issue is rather bizarre, so I&#x27;m sharing it anyway in case anyone has any advice.
 My Emacs is emacs-mac GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin23.2.0, Carbon Version 170 AppKit 2487.3) of 2024-01-04, installed with brew install emacs-mac --with-librsvg --with-mac-metal --with-native-compilation --with-natural-title-bar --with-unlimited-select
 My installed packages are committed to a git repo and they are a mix of melpa and melpa-stable with the preference for the latter.
 Yesterday I was upgrading packages (I have to apologize if this and a few next steps are vague as I was not keeping a log) and for some reason had to restart Emacs, which then gave me an error on (require &#x27;lsp-clangd) that it couldn&#x27;t be found. I check the load-path and see that lsp-mode is no longer its part, even though it was a user selected package. I do a package-reinstall for it, restart Emacs and it no longer starts: on mac, the icon jumps at the bottom of the screen for a second and goes away. Adding --debug-init isn&#x27;t helpful. Since my package directory is versioned, I git restore it, and it does not help, neither does deleting the ELN cache.
 Then I wipe my package directory and install user selected packages one by one, and everything goes fine until I get to helm-org. Install it, and Emacs fails to start. Restore an older copy of package directory (not using git restore) which does not have it, Emacs starts. This package has been installed for ages without any issues before.
 What is this I don&#x27;t even. Of course for now I fixed my setup with helm-org removed, but how do I get to the bottom of the issue?

                              <span>I defined the following macro to evaluate some expressions after a list of features has loaded, basing it on the with-eval-after-load macro.
 (defmacro with-eval-after-load-all (files &amp;rest body) &quot;Execute BODY after FILES are loaded. FILES is a list; usually it contains feature names, but it can also have file-names, in case a file does not provide any feature. See &#x60;eval-after-load&#x27; for more details about the different forms of the elments of FILES and their semantics. Do not quote the FILES list.&quot; (declare (indent 1) (debug (form def-body))) (let ((output &#x60;(lambda () ,@body))) (while (not (null files)) (setq output &#x60;(eval-after-load ,(pop files) ,output)) ) (print output) ) ) 
 And used it to execute the following in my config:
 (with-eval-after-load-all (&#x27;evil &#x27;undo-fu) (setq evil-undo-system &#x27;undo-fu)) 
 Emacs complains with the following error:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable undo-fu) (lambda nil undo-fu)() eval-after-load(undo-fu undo-fu) elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil) eval-last-sexp(nil) funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil) command-execute(eval-last-sexp) 
 The previous macro evaluates to:
 (eval-after-load &#x27;undo-fu (eval-after-load &#x27;evil (lambda nil (setq evil-undo-system &#x27;undo-fu)))) 
 Why is this wrong? Evaluating the inner eval-after-load works, but evaluating the outer one doesn&#x27;t.

I just create it and have no time to create some xkb config files or analyze it statistically (only intuitively analyzed). I need your advices. Thanks!

                              <span>I have lsp-mode and lps-pyright working on my emacs setup as part of my attempt to get emacs working as a python IDE. I&#x27;ve been using emacs for about a week, and I like it a lot. I have python 3.11.7 installed as part of my Gentoo Linux install. The Gentoo package manager is written in python and I want to maintain a level of separation between my development environments and the package managers environment. To get lsp-mode and lsp-pyright working, I&#x27;ve created a emacs_venv in my ~/.emacs.d/ folder and then pip installed the lsp-server/pyright stuff to that. Then added that environment to my exec-path and set python-shell-virtual-environment-root to that folder. 
 Can I now use direnv to manage project environments? 
 Is there a better way to handle separating the Gentoo environment from an environment that emacs needs while in python-mode?

                              <span>Plane is an open-source alternative to Jira. In less than a year, it becomes the most starred project management tool on GitHub: https://plane.so/blog/how-we-got-to-20k-github-stars
 Collaboration is essential in project management. org-jira is a good solution for that. But Jira isn&#x27;t open source.
 Collaboration is possible using git with people mastering org mode. But for me, org mode isn&#x27;t a generic FOSS project management solution if I should use it in a real situation, because I need use a property solution(Jira) for the collaboration in team.
 ​
 Will org mode community integrate org mode with Plane in futur, or exist already such project in progress?

                              <span>In Orgmode, org-preview-latex-fragment turns $\int_0^x \sin x &#x3D; 0.5$ into an inline LaTeX formatted equation.
 As I under the org-previews-latex-fragment process - Orgmode makes a .tex -&gt; LaTeX makes a .dvi -&gt; dvipng makes a .png.
 But it didn&#x27;t work - at least not without some massaging. emacs 29.1, orgmode 9.6.15, FreeBSD 13. 
 There were 2 problems. 1) LaTeX couldn&#x27;t make a .dvi file, and 2) dvipng couldn&#x27;t make a .png file
 My dirty fixes
  
Orgmode made a .tex file with a line % Package hyperref omitted but hyperref is required by the later line \hypersetup{colorlinks, linkcolor&#x3D;blue, urlcolor&#x3D;bblue} . After inserting \\usepackage{hyperref} into org-format-latex-header LaTeX started making .dvi files.
 Orgmode calls dvipng ../../../tmp/orgtexXXXXXX.dvi - where the number of &quot;../&quot;&#x27;s is based on the directory depth of the PARENT DIRECTORY of my fiddles.org file (I moved the file, but the number of ../ was always one too few) It looks at /usr/tmp not /tmp. After creating a symlink from /usr/tmp to /tmp, dvipng started making png files.
  
I&#x27;m not familiar with Linux, perhaps tmp is in /usr/tmp - but in FreeBSD /tmp is a top level directory. The fix at the moment is a symlink pointing at /tmp from /usr/tmp. Is a little weird though, as LaTeX saves its work into /tmp.
 So, two questions.
  
Is poking a \usepackage{hyperref} into org-format-latex-header the right way to go?
 Is there a orgmode variable used to point dvipng at /tmp rather than at ../../../tmp?
  
I&#x27;m very new to emacs and orgmode, but there seems to be a variable for everything - perhaps I&#x27;m looking in the wrong places

                              <span>Hello Scala fam,
 I am a project manager, but before that, I was a software engineer, mostly working with .NET and later Objective-C/Swift (iOS).
 After 3-4 years as a project manager, I am thinking about ‘going back.’
 Writing software is much more fun than managing projects 😅😀
 So, I would like to learn Scala.
 Besides the book from Odersky and rockthejvm course(s), are there any other resources that I should consider for a beginner?
 Any advice for an ex-software engineer? 🫣
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Publishing a JAR/package to Github packages using Mill is probably a simple task, but I just can&#x27;t figure out how to do it. 
 I tried the following command, but mill errors out with Code: 401  mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll .publishArtifacts --sonatypeUri https://maven.pkg.github.com// --stagingRelease false 
 Can anyone point me to steps I can follow (or a tutorial would be nice) to publish a JAR on Github packages?
 PS: I come from the Python world. Compared to pypi, things in JVM appear very confusing, with terms like maven central, sonatype, ivy, (and to a lesser extent) artifactory and bintray thrown around a lot. (I think) I understand maven-central, as being the de-facto repository (so kind of like pypi) that hosts most of the publicly available packages. I have no clue what others are for, or if I need to learn about them!

                              <span>I observed lately that there is a lot of division in Scala community. There are multiple groups of users, some more vocal than others.
 This is counterproductive as people have different requirements, tastes, styles, and backgrounds.
 In my view, this goes against what Scala stands for, a Scalable language:
 &quot;A programming language designed to adapt to the evolving needs of its users.&quot;
 However, not all users have the same requirements. There is no one solution for everyone.
 Is there a way in 2024 to make the Scala community more inclusive and accept that every group has its pros and cons for the technical choices they make?
 Here are some groups I observed, mainly around async handling:
  
People who try to write everything with IO.
 People who keep using Scala Future.
 People who use plain threads / scala-async / project Loom / direct style.
  
While you may have a preference for one group, we should all agree that there is nothing wrong with choosing one or another. It&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference and the overall requirements and trade-offs.
 It&#x27;s essential to recognise that outside the Scala community, some of these paradigms represent the majority.
 For example, Scala Future behave the same as the Kotlin CompletableFuture, the Java CompletableFuture, the NodeJS Promise.
 What&#x27;s nice about each group is that people coming from Haskell/familiar with IO monad may be at home in group 1.
 People coming from Java/Kotlin/Javascript will be at home in groups 3 and 2.
 People coming from Python will be at home in group 3.
 So, instead of being consumed by division. Can the community be joined by the diversity and cooperation instead?
 It&#x27;s a Scalable language where everyone can be at home. We all have to win with Scala being a multi-purpose language as it was intended.
 Much love to each of the groups, have a wonderful day!

 This was my random COVID project and after 4 years of feature creep I&#x27;ve finally released it. There&#x27;s still a lot more I have planned and this is intended to be a useful app and not just a for fun project. Hope y&#x27;all enjoy.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using hls for a while now and I think it&#x27;s great but there&#x27;s one thing that kinda annoys me and I would like to hear if there&#x27;s a reason for this or not: If a fuction is polymorphic, it blows up the amount of information showed when viewing docs (and type info) with hls. Is this simply a configuration thing? 
 ​
 without parametric polymorphism
 with parametric polymorphism
 worst of all, most of the added information is redundant! I think that F# did it correctly here (please ignore the portuguese bits): 
 Visual Studio F#
 In this one you can clearly see the most generic form of the function, but it also has a list of all the parameters and their concrete types.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve come across Porstmann a few times as the &quot;intellectual father of the A-Series&quot;,  the &quot;creator of the DIN formats&quot;, and the creator of A4 in various contexts. I saw that he wrote an interesting looking handbook in the mid-1920s and was curious if anyone has come across or even read it? It looks like it went into three editions up to the 1950s. I&#x27;m not seeing any English translations at present. I suspect it has material on using card indexes as databases and may be focused on business use, but may also have some connections to note taking practices of the time. I&#x27;ve also found several references to Porstmann&#x27;s work and that of George Christoph Lichtenberg which makes me even more curious about the potential note taking connections.

I found impressive how he structures everything from the beginning in notecards and has like his own kind of Zettelkästen where he stores a lot of ideas, plots, characters, backgrounds and everything in between. A similar workflow from the one I&#x27;ve seen taken by Ryan Holiday and Robert Greene.
I hope you like it.</span>

                              <span>Hi, all,
 Apologies if this post comes off as frustrated. I&#x27;ve just spent the last several hours struggling to make Emacs do what would be a checkbox in any other program, and it&#x27;s really putting a damper on my triumphant return to using it.
 All I want is this:
  
To run the systemd service and have an Emacs daemon in the background.
 For emacsclient (or an alias) called in the terminal to open a new buffer / frame / window / unit / pane / flibflab / whatever the hell in the Emacs GUI to edit the file. And, preferably, to focus the GUI when it does so.
 For the Emacs GUI to use JUST ONE WINDOW (in the desktop environment sense) and not open a separate one unless I explicitly tell it to do that.
 For the KDE .desktop file for Emacsclient to open the GUI if it isn&#x27;t open and focus the GUI i…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am relatively new to emacs and was tinkering with my config. I planned to make it so p and P use the &quot;0 register so that when I delete things, it doesn&#x27;t mess up my pasting. I wrote two super small functions I want to run instead of the default evil functions and plugged them into general. However, p and P still retain their original functionality. In fact, if I do &#x27;ctrl h k p&#x27; I still see that p is mapped to the evil function. I tried to do a similar remap using evil-define-keymap and got the same result. I would appreciate any tips!

 Default Configuration - User-Defined Titles
 One of the configuration options is the org-alert-notification-title option which allows you to define what your notification title will be. The default value for this is &quot;\org*&quot;* but it can overriden by the user.
 Here is a sample configuration and an example of how it looks like for my TODO and the custom title named &quot;Org Alert Notification&quot;.

                              <span>I have been using Emacs for thirty years now, and I obviously have amassed a fair share of crust in my .emacs file. The following config is something I have probably had for at least 25 years now, and I have no idea who the original author was:
 (defun s-scroll-up () &quot;Make pgup behave better (cursor to first line at start of buffer)&quot; (interactive) (if (condition-case nil (scroll-up) (error &#x27;t)) (goto-char (point-max)) ())) (defun s-scroll-down () &quot;Make pgdown behave better (cursor to last line at end of buffer)&quot; (interactive) (if (condition-case nil (scroll-down) (error &#x27;t)) (goto-char (point-min)) ())) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;s-scroll-up) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;

 My question is: is this still needed? It seems to me such an obvious &quot;right&quot; behavior that I would have expected Emacs to start behaving this way out-of-the-box with some release since when I first picked up this config, or at the least offer some customization variable. If there is one, I can&#x27;t find it, however. Anyone know of a better way of achieving this? (Not that it kills me to keep it).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried various different ways of saving desktops, including Bookmark Plus and the minimal example in the Emacs Wiki. They&#x27;re fine, but I would like to be able to automatically save my desktop every few hours (I use Emacs in daemon mode and basically only close it every 3 weeks or so), rather than manually saving it. Doing (desktop-save-mode 1) seems to have the unfortunate effect of restoring the desktop everytime you restart, unless you explicitally tell Emacs not to.
 Is there an elegant way to have auto-save without auto-restore?
 I have two main ideas:
  
Enable desktop-save-mode, but create a shell alias for emacs --no-desktop. This seems fairly straightforward, and I could even add --daemon to the alias since I almost always use that option as well.
 
Create a timer for one of the desktop save functions, e.g. bmkp-set-desktop-bookmark. I&#x27;m a little unfamiliar with timers in Emacs but this seems like a perfect use-case for them. I could even time-stamp the desktop file name when the save-function is called.
 
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup emacs as IDE for my Python projects.
 I&#x27;m coming from pycharm where I can set a remote interpreter located in a docker image, this way I only install my dependencies in the docker image and not locally.
 I&#x27;m trying to achieve the same result in emacs using lsp-mode, python-mode and envrc and using direnv and container-env.
 I have the following .envrc file inside my root directory 
 CONTAINER_NAME&#x3D;localhost:5000/myimage:latest
 CONTAINER_WRAPPERS&#x3D;(python, pylsp)
 container_layout 
 My init.el looks like this
 (use-package lsp-mode
 :ensure t
 :init
 ;; set prefix for lsp-command-keymap (few alternatives - &quot;C-l&quot;, &quot;C-c l&quot;)
 (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-c l&quot;)
 :hook (;; replace XXX-mode with concrete major-mode(e. g. python-mode)
 (zig-mode . lsp-deferred)
 (python-mode . lsp-deferred)
 ;; if you want which-key integration
 (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))
 :commands lsp-deferred) 
 (use-package envrc
 :ensure t
 :config
 (envrc-global-mode))
 (use-package python-mode
 :ensure t
 )
 It seems that envrc is loaded correctly so if I run M-x python I got the right interpreter. But the gotodef and autocomplete with packages that are only installed inside the container is not working.
 What I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m using lsp-mode for typescript-react.
 
When writing an html attribute then clicking on the right arrow or C-f or C-e or a mouse click, lsp will directly apply a formatting edit, like the following:
 1- By moving the code line about 4 or 5 tabs to the right.
 2- If I didn&#x27;t yet wrote the closing tag, everything will back to its normal place, once I write the closing tag.
 3- If I edited or added another attribute, the same thing happens without the correction.
 
In the messages minibuffer it says:
 &quot;LSP :: Applying 1 edits to &#x60;NewSpaceUpdate.jsx&#x27; ...&quot;
 &quot;Applying 1 edits to &#x60;NewSpaceUpdate.jsx&#x27; ...done&quot;
 
If I click on C-/ it will undo the action.
 
Does anyone know a way to stop this behavior?
  
Thanks.

                              <span>I have a big vanilla config 10,000+ lines with lots of packages. The code is mostly
 spaghetti code of over engineering that I have done at times. Some functions
 I probably don&#x27;t use anymore. Performance is not too bad, I get a decent
 startup time. When problems come I can usually figure out where the
 problem is and fix it. Part of me wants to clean it up because I think I&#x27;m
 going to use Emacs for the rest of my life so might as well but the other part of me says
 if it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it. Should I clean it up? Not refactor code,
 just make it more nice and clean. Split into more modules if 
 possible, remove unused functions. What would you do? What does your config look like?

 I&#x27;ve replaced scroll-up/down and recenter-top-bottom commands with their pixel-scroll counterparts and it feels great. I was okay with the old school versions too but this one feels easier for eyes. Also, it will be easier for colleagues to follow where we are at when screen sharing :)

                              <span>Hey everyone, I pretty much gave up learning python and Javascript due to them being being similar enough to one another to confuse me. I have been learning haskell because my mind works more mathematically so i figured i might as well program in a language that is concise with math. I know haskell is used more for industrial and scientific purposes but I am wondering if anyone is using it for more practical everyday purposes like web application dev and or simple desktop applications with a gui. If so, can anyone reccomend some good resources for building simple practical applications with it? Either way I&#x27;m interested to know what types of applications people are building with haskell in the broad general sense. Thanks

 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and are learning QuickCheck for now. What I knew is to design the property and then it can enable QuickCheck for testing. However, for computation-intensive algorithm function, for example CRC-8 , how do you usually design the property for QuickCheck testing? Is there any tip in how to design the property while using QuickCheck? Thank you

                              <span>Hello. I am trying to write some bindings to a C library called wlroots.
 There is a struct, &quot;wlr_pointer&quot; that contains a nested struct. The struct is declared without a type name inside that struct.
 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/include/wlr/types/wlr_pointer.h?ref_type&#x3D;heads
 I am trying to write peek, poke, alignment and sizeOf implementations for the Storable typeclass for these struct types in Haskell.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to do this, because the pattern isn&#x27;t the same as some of the other FFI code that I&#x27;m looking at. Searching the web for a good reference on how to do this was less than pointless, and the Real Word Haskell section on the C FFI didn&#x27;t mention nested structs like this.
 The PR that I made that attempted to do this is here, and I doubt it&#x27;s correct.
 https://github.com/bradrn/wlhs/pull/4 
 I guess what I&#x27;m asking is similar to this SO post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8099678/haskell-ffi-for-c-recursive-struct-and-union
 Which I didn&#x27;t find at first because of my chosen keywords &quot;anonymous&quot; and &quot;nested&quot;.

8 months of OCaml after 8 years of Haskell in production by Dmitrii Kovanikov

 Is there a way that I can disable these autoloads from being generated on a per-hook basis? Or do what I&#x27;m trying to do in a cleaner way?
 The canonical way would be to setup the hooks in the whitespace and company use-package declarations but that&#x27;s counter intuitive: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package whitespace :ensure nil :hook python-mode)
 (use-package company :hook python-mode) &#x60;&#x60; and even theuse-package&#x60; documentation advertises the following:
  
Allow gathering all the configuration details of a package into one place
  
It makes more sense to me to have something akin to the following instead:  (with-eval-after-load &#x27;prog-mode (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;diff-hl-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;eldoc-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;show-paren-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;flyspell-prog-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;flycheck-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;yas-minor-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;company-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;electric-pair-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;electric-layout-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;display-line-numbers-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;hl-line-mode) (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook #&#x27;bug-reference-prog-mode))

                              <span>In true Emacs User Shave a Yak fashion, I need to store some credentials I&#x27;ll need for Magit Forge and I would prefer to configure auth-source to pull API tokens from gnome-keyring (as opposed to ~/.authinfo* or ~/.netrc). I&#x27;ve found some blog posts etc on how to do this integration with KeePassXC but not for gnome-keyring. Perhaps someone:
  
knows of an auth-source+gnome-keyring reference I&#x27;ve missed?
 would be willing to share their config snippets?
  
I did ask a couple of LLMs for guidance and, true to their kind, they provided information which was voluminous, detailed, convincing...and 100% BS.
 EDIT: Yes, the official auth-source docs included with Emacs do reference KeePassXC and gnome-keyring and dbus Secret Service. But there&#x27;s not much guidance as to how to stitch things together with that API.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use the org-alert package to send notifications from my Emacs to my Linux laptop. This package uses the alert package backend to send notifications to my machine.
 My configuration is rather simple:
 (use-package org-alert :ensure t :after org :custom (alert-default-style &#x27;libnotify) :config (progn ;; Setup (setq org-alert-interval 300 org-alert-notification-title &quot;Org Alert Reminder&quot;) (org-alert-enable) ) ) 
 This works well enough on Linux. I made a post a few days ago explaining my setup in which I seamlessly integrate the native GUI Emacs app for Android and my Linux machine. 
 Since I use Emacs on my Android as well I needed to have notifications on Android too. I found it cumbersome to install termux-notifications since I would need to sign and repackage the apk for Termux…</span>

                              <span>I use Arch and Emacs, sddm with latest updates, and also set at .xsession:
 export GTK_IM_MODULE&#x3D;ibus export QT_IM_MODULE&#x3D;ibus export XMODIFIERS&#x3D;@im&#x3D;ibus 
 But when I type in emacs with ibus and mozc (or sunpinin, ibus hangul plugin), then restart ibus-daemon. I cannot type japanese or chinese anymore in opened emacs windows, the only way make ibus work is running new emacs process.
 I run ibus with &#x60;ibus-daemon -dxr --verbose&#x60;, it show that ibus don&#x27;t capure keypress in emacs windows anymore even when it is new frame, only in new emacs process windows, I could type chineses or japaneses.
 The other apps like chrome, xterm, neovim ... work as normal, the logs in verbose mode show keypress as normal, it seems like ibus hates emacs?
 I search for log but can&#x27;t find anything relate. This is versions number:
 &gt;&gt;&gt;- neofetch Arch Linux x86_64 6.6.7-arch1-1 &gt;&gt;&gt;- yay -Qi emacs ibus Name : emacs Version : 29.1-4 Name : ibus Version : 1.5.29-2 &gt;&gt;&gt;- localectl System Locale: LANG&#x3D;en_US.UTF-8 VC Keymap: (unset) X11 Layout: (unset) &gt;&gt;&gt;- locale -a C C.utf8 en_US.utf8 ja_JP.utf8 ko_KR ko_KR.euckr ko_KR.utf8 korean korean.euc POSIX vi_VN vi_VN.utf8 zh_CN.utf8 zh_HK.utf8

                              <span>Hiya! 
 I would like to share with you all a little package package I&#x27;ve written here https://github.com/JasZhe/window-stool for code context. 
 There&#x27;s a few similar packages out there like lsp/eglot breadcrumbs, treesitter-context, and topsy to name a few but most of them use header-line (or in the case of treesitter-context, a childframe) which is limited to a single line.
 I really liked how context.vim had a sort of &quot;cascading&quot; context style and I didn&#x27;t find anything similar to it so I figured I&#x27;d give it my own shot here. 
 To achieve that, this package uses overlays and so it may not be as performant as others, but I haven&#x27;t experienced too much slowness personally, even on a pretty old 2017 Macbook. 
 It basically constantly moves an overlay to be at the top of the window to act like a pseudo multi-line header-line. I also opted to use a simple indentation based heuristic for figuring out the context as a default. There&#x27;s customization options to specify different kinds of context functions depending on the major mode. I&#x27;ve included a simple one for org-mode using headings. 
 In the future, I might try to add some tree-sitter support when I get a chance to dig into it.
 I named it window-stool cause it acts like a little stool that you can use to glimpse the contents above what your window can normally see.
 I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while, ironing out kinks along the way so hopefully there aren&#x27;t too many issues with others using it, but I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback for problems that crop up. Thanks emacs community!

                              <span>I have a setup where &#x60;emacs-irc.service&#x60; is running on boot, it basically just executes:
 emacs --fg-daemon&#x3D;irc 
 An idea is to have irc/erc window running in a background, so when i do:
 emacsclient -c --socket-name&#x3D;irc 
 (ofc i have alias for that) i immediately see an irc window
 i tried putting this in my init.el:
 (if (string-equal server-name &quot;irc&quot;) (progn (same-window-prefix) (erc &#x27;:server &quot;irc.libera.chat&quot; &#x27;:port 6697 &#x27;:nick &quot;idle-servant&quot; &#x27;&amp;interactive-env &#x27;((erc-server-connect-function . erc-open-tls-stream) (erc--display-context (erc-interactive-display . erc)) (erc-join-buffer . window))))) 
 but for some reason it does nothing, even tho &#x60;(string-equal server-name &quot;irc&quot;)&#x60; result is &#x60;t&#x60;

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use Emacs through WSL2 as my primary Emacs on a Windows 11 laptop. As of January 2024, there are several problems with various options. The main problem is that network change/disconnections cause X windows to disappear (which is recoverable) and Wayland windows to become lost and unresponsive. This includes waking from sleep. I wanted to outline the options I&#x27;ve tested.
  
Using the native Wayland Linux App (pgtk build), it is possible to restore the lost window, sometimes, by clicking on the Emacsclient icon but often you just have to kill Emacs which sucks when you have Python/Julia/R REPLs or other buffers open that you want to continue working on. (It was also the case that you could not use Windows snap for managing the window position and size but that was fixed …</span>

 If I have this in my init.el:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (require &#x27;package)
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 (load-theme &#x27;manoj-dark)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 then performing this:
  M-: (getenv &quot;TERM&quot;) 
 or this:
  C-x d 
 crashes emacs
 Commenting out the top two lines, or the last line allows the getenv command to work.
 Any ideas?
 EDIT:
 Visiting any file before I perform the getenv allows it to complete successfully The graphical emacs works fine, only when I lauch with -nw does it exhibit this behaviour.

 I am a new Emacs user. What is driving me to do this is that Emacs is sometimes crashing or closing unexpectedly and I would like to know the reason why this happens so I can prevent it.
 I have tried Googling this question, searching in Reddit and the Emacs documentation, and using Chatgpt to no avail. I am clearly missing where this information is, so any help is most appreciated.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi all!
 I recently have started learning emacs. I did the built-in tutorial and followed a couple of SystemCrafters’s “Emacs From Scratch” videos, and I’m facing a dilemma right now.
 Of course, evil-mode is hugely popular and has a lot of support, often being called the best vim emulator. Even SystemCrafters uses it, which to me, is a big vouch for using it.
 However, in reading some other reddit posts about others asking this same question, many people said that it had compatibility issues with some plugins, and relying on vim emulators has always left a bad taste in my mouth from other editors. Also, as a new emacs user, I don’t know how much of the emacs experience changes with evil-mode, and I don’t have the knowledge to be able to thoroughly understand and debug any issues that might come up from using it.
 So, I’m mostly just looking for some affirmation and anecdotes, good and bad, about evil-mode: if it will hurt me as a new user, and generally any heads-ups that could help me. Thank you!!

I would like to remove those with Elisp so that I can use the output for a completion I&#x27;m trying to display in the shell.

 Is this possible or do I need to resort to processing the output with another program outside of Emacs like &#x60;sed&#x60;?

                              <span>I have my bibtex library stored on Dropbox (file name: references.bib). When i try to link to that library, it says &quot;Waiting&quot; under the file icon and the circling round indicator is on and it keeps going for a long time -- now it has been over an hour. I suspect I am doing something wrong. The file is perhaps a bit on the large side (~20MB) but I suspect it should not take this long.
Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</span>

                              <span>Pretty new here to the singleton library and currently trying to refactor some code that I previously hacked together using Data.Dynamic. To keep the problem as simple as possible, I&#x27;ve boiled down my application to the following (nonsensical) example:
  data Foo &#x3D; A | B deriving (Eq, Ord) genSingletons [&#x27;&#x27;Foo] class MyConstraint (t :: k) instance MyConstraint &#x27;A instance MyConstraint &#x27;B f :: forall k . (forall (t :: k) . MyConstraint t) &#x3D;&gt; () f &#x3D; () v &#x3D; f @Foo -- this does not work, even though forall (t: Foo) . MyConstraint t 
 Basically, I have some function f which for a given kind k (or at least a given list of types of kind k) needs to know that all types belonging to that kind (or in that list) satisfy some constraint. Conveniently, I can express this using QuantifiedConstraints, and make properly make use of that constraint in the function&#x27;s body. The problem is that I never seem to be able to call that function in a way that it satisfies this quantified constraint, and I don&#x27;t know how to tell Haskell that it does actually satisfy this constraint forall t :: Foo in this case. Any ideas/suggestions?

 I&#x27;m trying to insall ghcid with cabal install ghcid, and have bunch of errors due to lack of modules (see below).
 Didn&#x27;t find any solutions in internet, may be somebody could help me with this?
 Cabal output:

 Scala can be an advanced version of Java. It is more expressive. You can write neat code. All this comes with an acceptable learning curve. Valid choice.
 If you use Scala+Cats, it means you want to do advanced FP. Then why not just use Haskell? Instead of using a tool to turn stones into gold, you can just pick gold...
 And Cats can&#x27;t make pure gold for you, because there is no linting tool in Scala to enforce the purity. Your teammate can still write functions that have side effects. A mix of pure + impure code is confusing and error-prone.

                              <span>I use org-mode for keeping notes, and have used it to plan projects I led in the past. Now I am managing a team of people, each of whom have their own projects, I am struggling to scale it to this task. I use org-journal to keep notes from meetings, org-capture to add my individual todos. I try and tag the meetings with the relevant projects, but meetings are with people, and sometimes people work on different projects. I have been tagging meetings/todos with people&#x27;s names, but recently tried org-secretary to add their names as properties, which seems a nicer idea (cleaner, more organised) but also seems less searchable than tags. 
 I would really like to get
 1. an individual overview, that called up for each person the most recent meeting notes and any todos with their name as a tag or property, and then
 2. an overview of overviews so I can scan through - when did we last meet, any outstanding TODOs (for me) or TASKs (for them), and then dip into the individual overview for each. 
 Ideally I could do this by project too (which would just be another tag), but the people view seems most urgent. 
 Are there any suggestions how I could go about this?

 Essentially what I&#x27;m doing is having an LLM proofread for me with ob-chatgpt-shell, paragraph by paragraph. It spits out a whole suggested paragraph, so I&#x27;d like to be able to compare that output to my input and work through the suggestions one at a time.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone. I suppose the solution to my problem must be fairly easy, but I&#x27;ve only recently started using Emacs for both coding and org mode, and I need some help with my config file.\
 Basically, I have a &quot;.emacs&quot; file that I started configuring through tutorials about a month ago. At the time, all I did was assemble together different elisp snippets from different configurations that I found online and liked. Inevitably, I accidentally created a kind of Frankenstein. My main problem is that I have contradictory information in (custom-set-faces) and (custom-theme-set-faces). Now, when I try to change something, it starts accumulating contradictory information and randomly selecting which one to pick.
 I want to clean up my config file, possibly try literate configuration. The problem is that I fear losing all my current configuration and being left with nothing, having to restart from scratch. Can anybody lend me a hand or share some resources?
 Here&#x27;s my configuration, if you&#x27;d like to take a look. Thanks a lot.

                              <span>I try to set the cursor color in my init.el by adding the following line last in init.el;
 (set-cursor-color (doom-color &#x27;yellow)) 
 I use a theme from the doom family, hence the doom-color call.
 This does not work, the cursor color is not yellow when Emacs starts. If I evaluate this piece of code after startup, the cursor will shift to yellow. I suspect this is caused by set-cursor-color setting the cursor color for the selected frame, only.
 The documentation for set-cursor-color says;
 You can also set the text cursor color, for all frames, by customizing the cursor face. 
 I have tried to figure out how to do this, without success. How do I change the cursor color for all frames?

                              <span>I would like to rewrite my Emacs config file. Since I started using Emacs, the org file from which I generate the init has become too large and difficult to navigate. Looking at popular configurations, I came to the conclusion that one of the first things I should do is split it into several files. I wonder if people here have any other advice or special know-how they have come across? What do you think are the best practices that lead to a nice tidy config that gets out of the way?

                              <span>Hello,
 The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group (TWG)  serves as an advisory organization for both the HF management and the Haskell community as a whole, by evaluating specific proposals for projects that can have broad, ecosystem-wide effects. These proposals can be:
  
Community RFCs that seek the community’s input on a project
 Community projects that will be executed primarily by the proposer, but seek administrative or financial support from the HF
 HF projects that a community member would like us to execute
 Other topics of relevance to the community
  
Volunteers wanted!
 We presently have three openings on the working group, and we’re seeking volunteers. Members are expected to attend a monthly meeting, to participate in and moderate discussion threads regarding specific proposals, and to evaluate proposals for their technical merits. From time to time, committee members may also be asked to help a community member revise their proposal. The ability to communicate well and respectfully is important for any potential member.
 These discussions have a real impact on the Haskell ecosystem, so this is an opportunity to give back in a meaningful way.
 If you are interested, or if you know someone who might be, please get in touch with me at director@haskell.foundation! You don’t have to be a long-term Haskeller, or someone who is deeply embedded in Haskell development - we have members with this background already. If you are unsure as to whether you would fit in, please get in touch, and we can have a chat about it. We would like to have members with diverse backgrounds, professional experiences, and knowledge. All self-nominations must be submitted by the end of the day on Jan 12th 2024.

                              <span>I&#x27;m really excited about this idea of how you can maintain referential transparency and still perform real mutations/effects without having to force something into a monad that you can&#x27;t &quot;break out&quot; of.
 In Clean, as in any language, monads are possible, but you are not dependent on them and can get the value back at any time, so the complex combination of different types of monads is unnecessary. Monads in Clean are therefore just a helpful tool to facilitate sequences of computations. In Haskell, however, monads like IO seem a bit hacky with their lots of magic in the background, where only the compiler developers themselves probably know how they actually work. This magic has always irritated me and distorted the idea of monads.
 This brings to mind the idea of creating a resource like a file completely referentially transparent as a mere program object, and manipulating it, just as you can do with numbers or other simple values, without actually causing anything outside of the programming. You&#x27;re just describing the transformations. And only when you actually want to perform all these operations in the real world you add “*World” and continue working with an unique object standing for an entity in the real world.

                              <span>Hi! Haskell noob here. I don&#x27;t know the right terms here so please bear with me if I misuse any terms. Thanks! 
 I am looking for an async programming model like boost asio (the proactor design pattern) in haskell. I am not sure how to articulate it for a web search but essentially what I am looking for is to translate a toy asio server in C++ with callbacks to haskell. 
 I can (and did) implement this using forkIO + Chan but I am curious if the following has a name in haskell.
 type Context mkSocket :: Context -&gt; IO Socket recvData :: Socket -&gt; (Buffer -&gt; IO a) -&gt; IO () runContextFor :: Duration -&gt; Context -&gt; IO () 
 Here, each Context should be able to manage its own event backend (epoll, select, IOCP) without depending on the haskell runtime. Ideally, I should be able to run the event loop every once in a while manually. Am I going in the right direction here?
 In spirit of the X-Y problem, what I am trying to solve is a reader on a socket forkIO $ forever (recvFrom sock 512 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; doSth) should be interruptible and I should be able to interrupt this &quot;blocking&quot; wait on the thread. I guess I can do the following but they don&#x27;t feel clean
  
by closing the socket and forcing an exception on all readers
 set a socket receive timeout and exit the &quot;blocking&quot; wait periodically
 use a System.Timeout.timeout on a read and poll

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a problem that has a state [Integer], logs a tuple ([Integer], Maybe String) and returns Maybe Integer. If using the transformers library, I&#x27;ll be working with the following type:
 MaybeT (StateT [Integer] (Writer [([Integer], Maybe String)])) 
 However, mtl doesn&#x27;t have a MaybeT. It seems there&#x27;s MonadState instead, but there&#x27;s no documentation on how to actually use it. In fact, I&#x27;ve searched far and wide, and all I see are articles like &quot;let&#x27;s make our own instance of MonadState&quot; or &quot;define MonadState from scratch&quot; followed by some fictitious code. After an hour, I feel like punching in their faces and screaming, &quot;FFS don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel, show me a real example instead&quot;.
 Sorry for the rant, but libraries like mtl and articles like the above are cancer for the Haskell community. The only silver living are the good people in the community, that&#x27;s who I&#x27;ve turned to for help.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am using intellij with sbt and Scala 3.3.1. I want to see the code that an anorm macro expands to: Macros.parser[]. The problem that I have is that, for whatever strange reason, this code triggers a compiler warning: [E029] Pattern Match Exhaustivity Warning for a specific case class.
 I&#x27;ve done some research into compiler options but the options related to macros have been removed in scala 3. See: https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/options-lookup.html and search for -Ymacros. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 As described in the title, I have problems with table alignment in my org files, as you can see in the following example:
 | 1 | 22 | 333 | 4444 | 55555 | 666666 | 7777777 |
 |------+------+------+------+-------+--------+---------|
 | Data | | | | | | |
 | | Data | | | | | |
 | | | Data | | | | |
 | | | | Data | | | |
 | | | | | Data | | |
 | | | | | | Data | |
 ​
 These are my related settings in ~/.emacs
 ;; Normal text fonts. Both variable and fixed pitch
 (custom-theme-set-faces
 &#x27;user
 &#x27;(variable-pitch ((t (:family &quot;ETBembo&quot; :height 130 :weight thin))))
 &#x27;(fixed-pitch ((t ( :family &quot;Fira Code Retina&quot; :height 130))))
 &#x27;(org-block ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))))
 &#x27;(org-code ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-document-info ((t (:foreground &quot;dark orange&quot;))))
 &#x27;(org-document-info-keyword ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-indent ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-link ((t (:foreground &quot;royal blue&quot; :underline t))))
 &#x27;(org-meta-line ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-property-value ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch))) t)
 &#x27;(org-special-keyword ((t (:inherit (font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)))))
 &#x27;(org-table ((t (:inherit fixed-pitch :foreground &quot;#83a598&quot;))))
 &#x27;(org-tag ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch) :weight bold :height 0.8))))
 &#x27;(org-verbatim ((t (:inherit (shadow fixed-pitch))))))
 ​
 ;;Trying to fix tables
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-table nil :inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch)
 ​
 ;; Set variable pitch as normal
 (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;variable-pitch-mode)
 ​
 ;; Make me select paragraph size myself
 (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;visual-line-mode)
 ​
 I tried changing many different settings, but have seen no improvement yet. Even if I force fixed-pitch with M-x, the tables still won&#x27;t align properly. Could someone help me figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                              <span>Greetings,
I&#x27;ve been getting around the Zettelkasten method for about 2 years, but never dove in.
I&#x27;ve tried several formats.
I&#x27;ve tried a file per each note and numbering it, such as 1.a, 1.a1, 2.a, and so on, but soon all the notes appeared the same to me, and I found hard to detect the paths of the notes
So I&#x27;ve tried a single outline (see the screenshot) because I&#x27;m a visual person, hoping to have a visual clue of the structure of the chains of thoughts, but again I feel confused when I see all of those lines.
Furthermore, I need a fast way to insert the new note into the System, because I have no time to get the extra hour each day in order to review the notes (I&#x27;m always on the rush).
I also tried a kind of PARA method, thinking of the opportunistic strategy, but I fear I&#x27;ll have difficulties when searching for older notes.
Any advice is accepted.
PS: a screenshot of the outline...</span>

 This may or may not emit a conflict issue on Syncthing side, which does not goes into the details of wheter the edited parts of the document are disjointed or not. So the question: do you use another synchronization technique that is more reliable regarding this aspect?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a non-programmer who uses emacs for writing (a dissertation) and research. Originally I was writing in LaTeX, now I write in org mode.
 I&#x27;ve found org mode to be a great tool for writing but I&#x27;m pretty new to it. I&#x27;m curious how other writers incorporate the task functionality of org mode into the writing process.
 So far, I&#x27;ve kept things separate. So I have my document I&#x27;m writing in (say a chapter) and I have a separate outline in a different document that I add my TODO tags to (see image).
 However, with this method, if I make changes to the writing document outline (which happens a lot), I have to update my tasks document. Is there a way to have the TODO tags in my writing document and be able to see those headlines in a separate buffer?
 Or is the another way you use TODO tags to keep track of writing tasks?
 All advice is welcome.
 ETA: I should also say that I use narrow/widen quite a bit, which I can do with a separate tasks file. Would be interested if other methods can similarly narrow in.

                              <span>hi everyone
 I want org-ellipsis to display the number of subheadings.
 that&#x27;s because of two reasons.
  
I want to add meaning to the decorations. 
 I want to get some information of big picture even if it&#x27;s folded.
  
It&#x27;s something like this: 
 * test (23)
 * testtest (3)
 I think you can understand the big picture of the file faster if you have numbers...
 (I think it&#x27;s useful to display some information individually, even if not just numbers.)
 ​
 So, I tried to implement this.
 I thought of assigning a unique value to ellipsis for individual lines by assigning a conditional value to org-ellipsis.
 but I couldn&#x27;t figure out the conditions to identify the ellipsis displayed on individual lines...
 and I read some code related to org-ellipsis, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out the mechanism to specifically display org-ellipsis.
 (All I found out was that the ellipsis value was stored in something like some archetype when collapsing headings...)
 ​
 if anyone has any hints please let me know !
 Also let me know your thought on the idea of adding information to org-ellipsis. 
 Apologize for my bad English and stupid attempt. thank you for long reading!

I can also see from the log buffer that DAP is being started only with the junit classpath env variable and without the class path to the test class. Note: flymake and lsp-java-build-project are successful. 
 Where/how do I set things up so the correct class path is passed onto DAP?

                              <span>Is it possible to have Magit diffs still be highlighted/colored with font-lock-mode disabled? I prefer no syntax highlighting, but still want to be able to easily read diffs.
 I know it is possible to override faces individually to achieve the same result, but this requires adding new faces consistently.

                              <span>I want to switch to the built in tree-sitter package (treesit) from the third party one. I followed the instructions and verified that my emacs is compiled with tree-sitter flag (I downloaded emacs binary from fedroa repos). I have libtree-sitter and libtree-sitter-devel installed from system package manager. Following is my configuration of tree-sitter
 (use-package treesit :ensure nil :custom (treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;((c++ &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp&quot;) (python &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python&quot;) (c &quot;https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c&quot;))) (major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((c++-mode . c++-ts-mode) (python-mode . python-ts-mode) (c-mode . c-ts-mode))) (treesit-font-lock-level 4)) 
 Though I cannot pin point exactly what I did but for some reason while before I simply got a nil for 
 (treesit-language-available-p &#x27;c++) 
 but now I am getting this for some reason 
 *** Eval error *** Wrong type argument: stringp, nil 
 What is even more confusing that c-ts-mode and python-ts-mode are working fine. 
 Here are my contents of ~/.config/emacs/tree-sitter
 . ├── libtree-sitter-c++.so ├── libtree-sitter-c.so └── libtree-sitter-python.so 
 Any help would be appreciated : )

                              <span>Over the past decade, pixel density of displays has increased significantly. On Mac, the &quot;Retina&quot; display concept represents a doubling of display density, from ~100 to ~200ppi. On HDPI Retina displays, applications are presented with and work in &quot;virtual&quot; pixels of 2x2 physical screen pixels, so that font sizes, icons, etc. remain &quot;normal&quot;. Then raster, vector and font drawing can make use of all the tiny pixels, for higher quality. My question is, how does Emacs on different systems handle HDPI display?
 My build (emacs-mac) provides some limited support for varying DPI. You can provide parallel high-res versions of image files named like file@2x.ext which are substituted for low-DPI images (without the @2x) automatically. You can similarly embed the text property :data-2x in generated image data. But standalone high density images (like Retina screenshots) must be scaled appropriately (often by 0.5x) to &quot;light all the pixels&quot; and not appear overly large.
 What do other ports do to accommodate high-DPI? Nothing? Do you just select very large font sizes? What if you have multiple displays with significantly different pixel density connected? How is image display handled? This seems like an area where some coherent treatment and documentation would be very helpful. But perhaps the underlying OS/display systems vary so greatly in their treatment of HDPI it limits this kind of progress?

                              <span>I have mentioned on the forum before that I&#x27;ve been working on a personal history for about 3 years.  This is captured in my ZK, in a purposeful way but with random timing.  Each zettel covers one thought or memory and is written following the normal process for producing a pithy, well-considered note.  So far, I have written 35 such zettels covering a variety of topics and all organized (yes, I admit it) using a structure note.
I have let random memories trigger the note writing, which probably explains why the overall process has been, well, random.  Recently, I’ve been thinking I’d like some more discipline and consistency in the process.  You know the saying - be careful what you wish for!

                              <span>Hello All,
 This is my first Reddit post so please let me know if I’ve done anything wrong. 
 I started with no experience in software developing a few years ago into a Scala environment so Scala is all I know. 
 I would say I am at a middle level point and trying to further my knowledge but I am struggling on making my learning efficient as I seem to go round and round reusing the same solutions. 
 Somebody who started with me went through Rock the JVM and he said it was the best thing he done. I’m thinking of starting that. 
 Has anybody got suggestions or recommendations on how to learn new things more effectively? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m currently searching a company, which uses Haskell and where I can do a internship. Some information about me: I have graduated in computer science and used to work one and a half years as a junior developer. At the moment I&#x27;m travelling through different countries, but I would love to also learn something related to development. Because I will continue my traveling and it&#x27;s more about learning something new (Haskell and functional programming), I&#x27;m not looking for a long term position, but more an internship. I&#x27;m happy to hear from you guys if you are interested. Greetings Micha😊

 How do I view both parts of the pair with the same lens? How can I write something like p ^. both . _z that will give me (3, 9)?
 (Yes, I know p ^.. both . _z gives [3, 9], but that&#x27;s a list not a pair. I want a pair.)
 (A V3 is a three-dimensional point from the Linear library. It has lenses like _x and _z to work with particular elements, so I can write (V3 1 2 3) ^. _x -&gt; 1 and (V3 1 2 3) &amp; _z .~ 88 -&gt; V3 1 2 88.)

 Haskell is notoriously not very pretty when it comes to tooling and dev-environment.
 What would be, in your opinion, the cleanest way of setting up your toolchain and interacting with it? Consistent, sensible file locations, organized packages, and anything else you can think of.
 We&#x27;re not going to get Cargo, but we can definitely do better than what I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people doing.
 Attempting to use as few tools as possible that accomplish as much as possible. 
 What is your minimalist, sane environment and tooling?

When I debug Rust code I don&#x27;t get syntax highlighting under certain inactive code (specifically when statements like #[cfg(target_arch &#x3D; &quot;x86_64&quot;)] appear). I tried adding a line to my .cargo/config to enable these features features but rust-analyzer doesn&#x27;t seem to pick it up. I feel like there&#x27;s a basic option for this, so apologies if I&#x27;ve missed something but I&#x27;m rather new to emacs.

                              <span>So I followed the mastering emacs guide to installing tree-sitter but am left a bit confused about what actually these additional major modes are and have some questions.
  
What is the difference between the installing the package tree-sitter and building emacs with tree-sitter? Which one should I use given both options? 
 Do these new ts major modes serve to replace existing modes or do they sit on-top of the regular modes? So If I was using rustic package for rust development, does rust-ts-mode essentially replace the rustic package or would I still need it? 
 How would you tell emacs to use tree-sitter mode if there are no default major modes for the language to begin with? For example rust or go don&#x27;t have built-in modes like python or bash do so a command like (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;((go-mode . go-ts-mode))) would not work unless you explicitly install the go-mode package.

                              <span>CUDA is a language that, by default is unsupported by treesit in emacs.
 It has a grammar defined in https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda.
 I have followed https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tree_002dsitter-Major-Modes.html and https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto to come up with the following:
 (use-package treesit-auto :custom (treesit-auto-install t) :config (add-to-list &#x27;treesit-auto-recipe-list (make-treesit-auto-recipe :lang &#x27;cuda :ts-mode &#x27;cuda-ts-mode :url &quot;https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-cuda&quot; :ext &quot;\\.cu\\&#x27;&quot;)) (treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist &#x27;all) (global-treesit-auto-mode 1)) (define-derived-mode cuda-ts-mode prog-mode &quot;CUDA[ts]&quot; &quot;Major mode for editing CUDA with tree-sitter.&quot; (when (treesit-ready-p &#x27;cuda) (treesit-major-mode-setup))) 
 Unfortunately, I have problems with the code:
  
When I open a .cu file, it is opened in Fundamental mode
 When I manually M-x cuda-ts-mode, it is enabled but I do not get syntax highlighting
 The CUDA parser is not automatically installed; I had to install it via M-x treesit-install-language-grammar and build the recipe interactively because it didn&#x27;t find my provided recipe
  
What is wrong about the code?
 Thanks and I wish you all a happy new year!
 EDIT: I was able to get syntax highlighting working by calling (treesit-parser-create &#x27;cuda) before (treesit-major-mode-setup) and by deriving from c-mode instead of prog-mode. Is this the correct solution?

 How do you find the best price for items while shopping online? You can go to each website and compare yourself manually. Or let Emacs do the hard work for you!!

                              <span>Intellij supports structural selection/editing for every supported language: https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/tips/extend-selection/ 
 It allows you to code in every language as if it was a lisp and the single feature that is keeping me hooked to intellij. Is there something close/similar in the emacs ecosystem?

                              <span>I always had the scrollbars disabled in Emacs because they kind of stand out in an ugly way and they are visible on every window even if not needed (even in the minibuffer window). As the toolkit scrollbars in Emacs are nevertheless handy, I tinkered a bit to solve both problems: * 1: on-demand-scroll-bar-mode is an alternative to scroll-bar-mode that shows vertical scroll bars only when needed https://github.com/florommel/on-demand-scroll-bar * 2: custom-css allows to load arbitrary CSS snippets to style Emacs&#x27;s GTK widgets. It comes with a dedicated mode to change the scrollbar visuals, as this requires special care. However, you can also adapt all other GTK widgets inside Emacs (menu bar, tool bar, context menus). The package requires a C module to be built and loaded and works only with GTK builds of Emacs. https://github.com/florommel/custom-css
 Both packages are experimental. Of course, they can be used independently from each other.

                              <span>Hello ! I&#x27;ve been learning Scala and FP, currently reading the red book. Is there any of you who use an &quot;non-FP&quot; http framework/library such Akka-http, Cask, Springboot, etc... with an FP core?
 Or you guys use a pure FP library such as http4s (I guess)? 
 I was thinking that using super mature web frameworks like Springboot + using FP for the service layer makes sense. 
 Hopefully this post doesn&#x27;t trigger too much the pure FP devs. I&#x27;m getting started with FP. I have a Java &amp; Python background. I did some Spark jobs in Scala also.

                              <span>Occasionally I have ideas or come across articles/book titles that I know I&#x27;d like to explore further for a given project, but right now is not the right time for them, usually because I&#x27;m in the middle of another task.
I want to:
this project, and not another one, or when I&#x27;m focused on following a different trail in this project).
I&#x27;m curious how you all handle these in your workflow.
Should I drop a zettel with the info in the appropriate place and hope I&#x27;ll resurface it at the right time? My issue here is that I often don&#x27;t know what information is going to come out of the article until I&#x27;ve read it.  Should I just take my best guess? (am I just overthinking it)?
Should I keep it on a separate task list or someday/maybe list?  My issue here is that I almost never get to the things on my someday/maybe list because I&#x27;m never looking at it when I&#x27;m working on a current project, and my task lists quickly get cluttered if they aren&#x27;t immediately actionable.
Other ideas?  Thanks!</span>

                              <span>This is a bit of an outlier, because it is not technically inline with zettelkasten method per se. However, I have found it incredibly useful, and it could be integrated into a zk with a little work I think.
I&#x27;ve started keeping an ongoing document called CHURN. It is organized by indentation, so it can be folded or hoisted to only show relevant sections by the two editors I use on it most frequently (vim and taskpaper). I just dump in there anything I think of, and freely re-organize (move up and down, indent, create headers and groups).  I keep tasks in taskpaper syntax, but essential to the model is the fact that anything can go in. The plan is to weekly move out of that file anything done/no longer relevant into my already-extant Weekly File ([[2023-W52]]),  and if anything develops en…</span>

I’ve tried both treemacs and neotree and changing the theme I’m using. How do I get rid of that dark sidebar when I open treemacs. In all the images I see online, when they open treemacs, they don’t have that.

                              <span>I have been trying to use EMACS for weeks now, yet the most simple of tasks still elude me. I want to make the editor look good so that I can actually start using it. I love the DOOM Emacs look but don&#x27;t want to use EVIL mode. Additionally, I don&#x27;t like the added complexity.
 My dream is to eventually build my own text editor with very simple features, but for now, I just want to get started using something other than Gedit. Emacs seems right because of the simplicity of setting custom key bindings, and the tables and code output in files.
 I understand that I need a theme.elfile and to place it in a folder. Then, I need to run some code to let Emacs know that the theme is there. However, I can&#x27;t find the theme.el file, and I don&#x27;t know which folder to place the theme in or what command I need to run. Help, please.

                              <span>I loved XEmacs at my first job but after that:
 1) I found only vim was available on some severs so just being young and open minded I learned that too
 2) I started using Mac os and never found aquamacs or x11 XEmacs seamless enough (I&#x27;ve tried and failed more than once).
 3) most significantly, emacs pinky crippled me, and MacBooks only have one Ctrl key so I couldn&#x27;t even alternate to give my left pinky a break

                              <span>Coming out of EmacsConf, I&#x27;m converting over to lsp-bridge. Right now I&#x27;m doing mostly golang and WASM stuff and so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to effectively use lsp-bridge with gopls. Looking at the lsp-bridge docs, it sure looks like gopls is first-class supported. However, I&#x27;m not getting anything lsp-bridge-y when I&#x27;m editing go code.
 Anyone care to share their working config snippet(s) for gopls and lsp-bridge? I would share mine except its such a moving target right now while I&#x27;m trying to get things working that I&#x27;m not sure it would produce productive feedback and probably just confuse folks who read the post a year from now.
 I&#x27;ll make everyone a deal, I&#x27;ll post my config once it&#x27;s resolved however I will warn I&#x27;m a literate config person so it&#x27;d not only be elisp but also some other tooling for making sure all of the Python dependencies etc are installed. I guess folks would be free to copy/paste/modify as they see fit for their setup.
 Thx!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using eglot for LSP and markdown-mode to render markdown in eldoc buffer.
 When I click on a link in an eldoc buffer for a rust project, it stops, flashes and then prints progn: Beginning of buffer in the *Message*.
 So, I figured maybe if I turn on toggle-debug-on-error I can find out where the error is happening. But, clicking the link does not trigger the error for debugging.
 So, I decided to put a message call at the beginning and end of the markdown-follow-thing-at-point (which is executed when you click on a link) like this:
 elisp (defun markdown-follow-thing-at-point (arg) &quot;Follow thing at point if possible, such as a reference link or wiki link. Opens inline and reference links in a browser. Opens wiki links to other files in the current window, or the another window if ARG is non-nil. See &#x60;markdown-follow-link-at-point&#x27; and &#x60;markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point&#x27;.&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (message &quot;markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos&quot;) (cond ((markdown-link-p) (markdown-follow-link-at-point)) ((markdown-wiki-link-p) (markdown-follow-wiki-link-at-point arg)) (t (let* ((values (markdown-link-at-pos (point))) (url (nth 3 values))) (unless url (user-error &quot;Nothing to follow at point&quot;)) (markdown--browse-url url)))) (message &quot;markdown-follow-thing-at-point sis&quot;)) 
 When I evaluate the defun and then click on the link again, it only prints the &quot;markdown-follow-thing-at-point sos&quot; which might imply that the function broke at some point, but I can&#x27;t see why with toggle-debug-on-error.
 I ideally would like it if it at least open the url in a web browser :(

 Can this be done?

 Is it possible to create blocks like this:

 It has become more important as I now have to use a password and I can&#x27;t have the password appearing in the file.

My favorite programming streamers are using emacs and I like the potential of emacs being an all around editor for any kind of usage, as well as its customizability. I&#x27;ve started learning the keybinds through the built in emacs tutorial. But I&#x27;m just wondering, if I&#x27;m wanting to be a true power user, do I need to become proficient at elisp?

                              <span>Wolfram Mathematica can apparently function as an lsp server now https://github.com/WolframResearch/LSPServer and the official notebook editor gives the user a dexterity of code manipulation on par with notepad, so I put 2 and 2 together and attempted to make emacs use the lsp server with mixed results.
 I simply took the command to start the lsp server from the wolfram plugin of vscode and added it to eglot like
 (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;(&#x27;xah-wolfram-mode &quot;/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel&quot; &quot;&#x60;kernel&#x60;&quot; &quot;-noinit&quot; &quot;-noprompt&quot; &quot;-nopaclet&quot; &quot;-noicon&quot; &quot;nostartuppaclets&quot; &quot;-run&quot; &quot;Needs[\&quot;LSPServer&#x60;\&quot;];LSPServer&#x60;StartServer[]&quot;)) 
 With this, the eldoc and the flymake integration part of eglot works, but I&#x27;m not getting most of the rest of the functionality, in particular &#x27;completion-at-point&#x27;.
 I also tried adding the same lsp server command to lsp-mode instead of eglot, but that just didn&#x27;t work at all.
 (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(xah-wolfram-mode . &quot;wolfram&quot;)) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection &#x27;(&quot;/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/13.3/Executables/WolframKernel&quot; &quot; &#x60;kernel&#x60; &quot;&quot; -noinit&quot; &quot;-noprompt &quot; &quot;-nopaclet&quot; &quot;-noicon&quot; &quot;-nostartuppaclets&quot; &quot;-run Needs[\&quot;LSPServer&#x60;\&quot;];LSPServer&#x60;StartServer[]&quot;)) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;wolfram&quot;) :server-id &#x27;wolfram) 
 Does someone have any idea how to troubleshoot this? I&#x27;m really more interested in the eglot route because that is what I use otherwise. I do completion with corfu and it works in the languages that eglot supports by default. The problem is that I&#x27;m not really getting any error messages even with everything in &#x27;eglot-strict-mode&#x27; turned on, so I have no idea what else to try.

                              <span>Hello Haskell community,
 I&#x27;m currently working on a Haskell project and have come across a challenge I hope you can help with. I&#x27;ve written several instances of functors in my source code, and I&#x27;m looking for an efficient way to ensure they comply with the Functor laws.
 Up until now, I&#x27;ve manually written tests for this purpose. You can see an example in my GitHub repository here: HaskellRank Functor Tests.
 Additionally, here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve been running these tests:
 (base) dewi@DewiJones:~/code/hask_tacer/hask-tracer2$ stack test --test-arguments&#x3D;&#x27;--match &quot;/HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/&quot;&#x27; hask-tracer2&gt; test (suite: spec, args: --match /HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson/) HaskellRank.HaskellRankJson Your Test Suite should pass the Functor Identity Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. should pass the Functor Composition Law [✔] +++ OK, passed 100 tests. Finished in 0.0084 seconds 2 examples, 0 failures hask-tracer2&gt; Test suite spec passed 
 While this approach works, it&#x27;s quite manual and time-consuming. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a tool or a feature in GHC/Stack that can automatically scan all functor instances in my source code and check if they adhere to the Functor laws. Any suggestions or advice on how to streamline this process would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance!

 Linking to C code works fine, but with C++ I get a bunch of &quot;undefined symbol ...&quot; spit out by ld.lld.exe during cabal build. Using dumpbin.exe I can see the symbols are present in the lib I&#x27;m trying to link to. So I assume this is C++ ABI incompatibility MSYS2 and VC++.
 Can I somehow configure my build to use the VC++ ABI when building my Haskell code?

 5) Stack can&#x27;t compile because it doesn&#x27;t know what version of a package to use

                              <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve been taking notes in org-mode for particle physics. Although simple LaTeX input for equations works very well, it would be nice to also have an easy way to have Feynman diagrams as inline images programatically. I have tried the LaTeX route with feynmp and tikz-feynman which does not work. I am not exporting to LaTeX most of the time, albeit even then it does not seem to work.
 Does anyone have a good workflow?

                              <span>This release brings Iron support for several libraries and other minor features.
 What is Iron?
 Iron is a library for refined types in Scala. You can attach predicates (also called &quot;refinements&quot;) to type and ensure they pass at compile-time or runtime:
 scala val x: Int :| Positive &#x3D; 5 val y: Int :| Positive &#x3D; -5 //Compile-time error val z: Either[String, Int :| Positive] &#x3D; -5.refineEither //Left(&quot;...&quot;) 
 Check the README for further information.
 Main changes
 Doobie &amp; Skunk support
 You can use Iron types in your query and tables. Here is an example using iron-doobie:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala import doobie.* import doobie.implicits.*
 import io.github.iltotore.iron.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.constraint.all.* import io.github.iltotore.iron.doobie.given

                              <span>Recently I figured out a pattern for quickly creating record parsers that utilises generics and HKTs: Parsing Recipe Pattern. I haven&#x27;t seen it before, and I think it might be useful and interesting to people, so I&#x27;m sharing it. I&#x27;m also curious to see if people in the community have thoughts about it.
 ​
 TL;DR I didn&#x27;t like how Cassava/Aeson forced me to proliferate newtype wrappers for different kinds of date formats. The recipe pattern is about allowing me to specify different date parsing formats for each record type without newtype wrappers and keep generic derivation of record parsers.

 it &quot;gets the chapter name&quot; $ do Chapter.name chapter &#x60;shouldBe&#x60; &quot;Protection of Children from Abuse and Neglect&quot;

 Here it is in two places, taking advantage of scoping:

 Hi, for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure how to use Memotrie or any other method to memoize, say, an HTML parsing function. I want to memoize it so I can write a bunch of Hspecs without re-parsing the HTML for each spec.
 IOW, I need a memoized test fixture. There used to be something on the Hspec site but it was removed.
  
Somehow I accidentally deleted the rest of my post. The important stuff is up there. :-P

Windows 11, Emacs master branch built last week, latest &#x60;master&#x60; eglot (via &#x60;straight.el&#x60;). Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t reproduce with a simplified init.el, so let me just describe what&#x27;s happening in case someone has any ideas:
 Error:

 It&#x27;s happening in &#x60;jsonrpc-events-buffer&#x60;, and I notice that there is no eglot events buffer in my emacs. (&#x60;eglot-events-buffer&#x60; says it can&#x27;t find an Eglot events buffer.)
 &#x60;clangd&#x60; does start OK from the cmd line, as does my python language server.
 I&#x27;m not sure where to dig in to debug it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 First, a little backstory.
 I have started getting interested in note-taking and knowledge bases about a year and a half ago. I first stumbled upon Notion, but quickly abandoned it due to its online-only nature. Then I started looking at alternatives like Obsidian and Logseq. Logseq caught my attention since it provided some nice features like daily journaling and &quot;Everything is a node&quot; strategy. I liked it. Then I learned that it was a watered down version of Emacs&#x27;s org-mode. That is when I started looking into Emacs. This was a year ago.
 I fell in love instantly. It was mind boggling to me that you could change anything and nothing was off limits. This was a year ago and I still change things on a daily basis. I think I may have fallen into the rabbit hole of endless customiza…</span>

                              <span>Hello there!
 It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve wanted to share my personal Emacs configuration. Either because I managed to configure something and someone needed help (like typescript on a React environment) or I needed help doing something and I was &quot;afraid&quot; of sharing it.
 Unfortunately my dotfile (yes, it was a ~/.emacs file) was ugly, old, slow and full of personal stuff.
 I managed to make it faster (0.6 seconds loadtime with ~95 packages on Linux), somewhat organized and (I hope) free of personal stuff.
 This config focuses on having the SAME (or close) user experience on both TUI and GUI. 
 Nowadays you can do things on tmux, for example, and you want to use Emacs as a sole editor with &#x60;emacs -nw&#x60; (the same fashion Neovim users do), others times you may want Emacs also as your terminal emulator and project organizer, you may want to start several instances of Emacs for gnus, ERC or other stuff, on either TUI or GUI. This config aims this situations, so nothing should be missing from GUI to TUI. You can even start it as a daemon and use at the same time on terminal and GUI without breaking anything.
 On this screenshot we have TUI (left) and GUI (right):

 It is made in a single file, using as much of default Emacs as possible, so you can fork it, customize or get inspired. It is not, by any means an &quot;Emacs Distro&quot;.
 I&#x27;d love some nice feedbacks (preferably on Github issues so we can track and reuse issues).

 But now, since I&#x27;m using pyenv consistently (instead of homebrew flavors of python that sometimes used to be summoned), I have another problem: whenever there is output in the shell, there is no newline after it.

 I&#x27;ve tried advising comint-preoutput-filter and comint-output-filter but none of this helped.
 Did anyone encounter this?

 The goto-address-mode use the var goto-address-url-regexp to match url,
 (defvar goto-address-url-regexp (concat &quot;\\&lt;&quot; (regexp-opt goto-address-uri-schemes t) thing-at-point-url-path-regexp) &quot;A regular expression probably matching a URL.&quot;) 
 how should I modify this variable in csv-mode to fix the bug? I guess to add hook like
 (add-hook &#x27;csv-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local goto-address-url-regexp ...)))

                              <span>I actually just found out about Schema Costco (I live in the Eye of the Sahara, so you know). I did see references to the Schema Store in the VSCode LSP sources awhile back. I can&#x27;t quite recall whether I was looking into Ansible LSP or just the standard VSCode Template ... but I /was/ reading tens of thousands of lines of typescript (as one does when configuring LSP servers based on that template). When I saw it, I assumed I just needed to download the schema files one at a time and put them somewhere (we live in schema poverty out here in the Sahara).
 In case anyone is wondering, this configuration seems to work for yaml-language-server ... which does have telemetry by the way. Make sure you thank your friendly Fully Corporate Open Source developers for helping us privacy-focused indivi…</span>

                              <span>I am trying to show a &quot;save&quot; icon in the mode line, but the character shows up incorrectly:
 All the displayed icons are the same \&quot;save\&quot; icon. Note the wrong icon next to \&quot;test.el\&quot; file name. The icon only shows correctly in the lower scratch buffer.
 When invoking C-u C-x &#x3D; I see this:
  position: 4 of 7 (43%), column: 3 character:  (displayed as ) (codepoint 57697, #o160541, #xe161) charset: unicode-bmp (Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000..U+FFFF)) code point in charset: 0xE161 syntax: w which means: word category: L:Strong L2R, j:Japanese to input: type &quot;C-x 8 RET e161&quot; buffer code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 file code: #xEE #x85 #xA1 (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix) display: by this font (glyph code): mac-ct:-*-Hannotate TC-regular-normal-normal-*-13-*-*-*-p-0-iso10646-1 (#x8AA8) 
 It looks like it uses &quot;Hannotate&quot; as a font, which seems incorrect. However I am not sure how to change this.
 What I have tried or looked at:
  
I have both all-the-icons and nerd-icons fonts installed with their respective commands. I also don&#x27;t think this is the issue as I can see the correct icon in the scratch buffer.
 I have tried the solutions suggested in this reddit thread. However, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I also tried to do (set-fontset-font t &#x27;unicode (font-spec :family &quot;all-the-icons&quot;) nil) (i.e. without &#x27;append), and whilst this works for the mode-line it messes up my icons in other places (e.g. dired buffers) as well. 
 Related to the thread above, I also don&#x27;t have any set-fontset-font in my config, nor any mention of unicode. So I don&#x27;t think I am changing any fonts in my config in this regard.
 
 I have looked at other similar reddit threads as well, and despite there being many on this topic there hasn&#x27;t been a solution that has worked so far.
 For whatever reason, the same config works on my other laptop which is also a Macbook with the same Emacs installation.
  
If it matters, I am on MacOS using emacs-plus (29.1).
 Any help is appreciated!

 I&#x27;ve downloaded Doom Emacs and configured so it would have support for JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Web, but when I run the command doom doctor it tells me:
  &gt; :lang python ! Couldn&#x27;t find black. Code formatting will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find pyflakes. Import management will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find isort. Import sorting will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find pipenv. pipenv support will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find nosetests. Running tests through nose will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find pytest. Running tests through pytest will not work. &gt; :lang web ! Couldn&#x27;t find tidy. Code formatting in HTML modes will not work. ! Couldn&#x27;t find stylelint. Linting for CSS modes will not work. There are 8 warnings! 
 This are things that I have in my system, for example: 
 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ pip list | grep black black 23.12.1 kelisei@Debian:~/.emacs.d$ npm -v tidy 9.2.0 
 I&#x27;ve tried searching but no one seems to have this particular error, some info that would be relevant:
  
Python version: 3.12.1
 Distro: Debian 12 
 NPM version: 9.2.0
 I&#x27;ve installed it from the package manager: emacs-gtk/stable,now 1:28.2+1-15 amd64 [installed]
 Thank you!

                              <span>I know that most people who are using Emacs do not care about emojis, but for people that do and that are, additionally, on Windows, I wanted to make it easier to find the solution. 
 I&#x27;ve decided to write a separate post for the ease of searchability for people who wonder the same. 
 Special thanks to u/eli-zaretskii for guiding me through this problem. Original post is here 
 First it&#x27;s important to note that as of today , on Emacs 29.1, it is NOT possible to have a colored emojis in Emacs. However it is possible to have black-and-white emojis, so here is a guide. 
 First make sure you have the right version. Open Emacs and check the version with: M-x version RET 
 If you don&#x27;t have 29.1 or later, please update by downloading the newest version from the official website.

 Which countries have the most Scala jobs? And where is the best country to move to for the best quality of life (ie somewhere where 90% of your salary isn&#x27;t spent on rent like the UK)

Swimming with Ideas
This is another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Please be courageous and add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring. This is an invitation to you to up your participation in the discussion.
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
Tags can either be used to categorize notes or give an idea of the note&#x27;s theme. My subatomic is a short summary or theme that replaces a theming tag. Tagging is unnecessary overhead.  Tag for note status and grouping only. Let structure notes and linking dominate.
Web Historical Trails breadcrumbs, GPS adventure breadcrumbs, and how the metaphor can be applied to how I explore my journey with life.
Focusing attention is a skill much like wood carving. Focusing takes time to develop. It can be learned. There are better and worse ways to practice. A mentor boosts progress. This habit is susceptible to the usual biases—especially the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
Things I&#x27;m reading:

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>Hi, everyone! I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered this forum.
A question has been nagging me ever since I started my ZK journey, and that is: what do I do if I&#x27;m into multiple topics?
My interests are all over the place: I&#x27;m into photography, sociology, history, theology, philosophy, linguistics, and education.
I am not sure whether I should have one giant slip box for everything or multiple ones for topics that have stuff in common. But that would also raise a conundrum. I&#x27;m into photography, and I&#x27;m into art history, so those two topics could be in one slip box. But then I&#x27;m also into history in general, so should art history be a part of the box with history or photography? Again, this is just an example, not an actual dilemma.
I&#x27;m going through Ahrens&#x27; book but I don&#x27;t know if it will touch on this particular topic. He does mention that Luhmann wrote on all sorts of subjects, which seems to indiciate he had a single slip box system for everything.
Has anyone here dealt with this?</span>

 Elisp doesn’t use namespaces or private variables. This means you’re basically living in the Wild West. The only thing that prevents constant name collisions is that people are responsible about naming everything with appropriate prefixes.
 EDIT: The specific use-case I&#x27;m considering is color-coding tabs for buffers. I know there are a couple packages that support tabs for buffers, and I&#x27;m currently using centaur-tabs. However, centaur-tabs has no color-coding options. I anticipate it will take a decent amount of work (and a better understanding of emacs/elisp than I have now) to achieve the color-coding that I want.

How to get lsp-treemacs-symbols to start whenever a project is opened up. 
 the same for treemacs
 how to close the symbols windows 
 getting a summary window to show all the errors and their location
 adjust the side window positioning
  
Thanks for any tips / how you have configured things.

 Output:
 CREATE TABLE test ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, the_name VARCHAR(255) ) 
 Notice how spaces are added between id and int to match alignment of the line below it.
 I tried the following packages, without success:
  
sqlformat (cli tool)
 prettier (with sql plugin)
 sql-indent
 format-sql
 sqlformat
  
None seem to do what this web based tool does: https://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi! 
 I&#x27;m having a weird behavior in my config where all my agenda files are showing at once at random moments, interrupting my workflow when I&#x27;m writing or programming. 
 I would like to know what commands are executing Emacs, on live. Maybe I can catch the problem (my guess is a hook or some advice function) and see how to solve it. 
 I tried view-lossage, but it doesn&#x27;t show anything useful. 
 Is anyone else experienced something similar?
 Thanks.

 This a bit different than my GTD + Emacs video but I still use both regardless.
 Let me know what you think. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi!
 I know there have been a few posts on eglot setup lately, but had trouble making things work as they should using all the advice there.
 Briefly, I was able to make eglot work for built-in package such as &#x60;os&#x60; or &#x60;sys&#x60; (though not consistently), but was never able to make completions work for installed packages (such as numpy or pandas). 
 I strongly suspect that the lsp server is not using the right Python version (I tried all servers, pyls, jedi, etc.). How can I coerce eglot and the underlying server to use the right Python version, and to load the right PYTHONPATHs? 
 In general, I use pyenv, and I use 
 (setq python-shell-interpreter &quot;/Users/$USER/.pyenv/shims/ipython&quot; 
 python-shell-interpreter-args &quot;-i --simple-prompt&quot;)
 ​
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>Hello everyone, happy end of the year.
 I&#x27;m wondering why I keep coming back to custom code snippets on StackOverflow whenever I need to colorise a buffer that has ANSI colours in it. Here&#x27;s a sample from a Rails app:
  Parameters: {&quot;id&quot;&#x3D;&gt;&quot;27&quot;} [1m[36mUser Load (1.0ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT &quot;users&quot;.* FROM &quot;users&quot; WHERE &quot;users&quot;.&quot;id&quot; &#x3D; $1 ORDER BY &quot;users&quot;.&quot;id&quot; ASC LIMIT $2[0m [[&quot;id&quot;, 2], [&quot;LIMIT&quot;, 1]] ↳ app/controllers/application_controller.rb:27:in &#x60;set_establishment&#x27; [1m[36mEstablishment Load (0.7ms)[0m [1m[34mSELECT &quot;establishments&quot;.* FROM &quot;establishments&quot; WHERE &quot;establishments&quot;.&quot;id&quot; &#x3D; $1 LIMIT $2[0m [[&quot;id&quot;, 2], [&quot;LIMIT&quot;, 1]] 
 Are ANSI escape sequences trickier than they seem? I&#x27;m going to resort to a custom bit of code (thank you people of StackOverflow) but I was wondering why log-view-mode or compilation-mode don&#x27;t have it built-in?
