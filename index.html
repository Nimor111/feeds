                              <span>A while ago I wrote a mini API server in order to let me leave &quot;private comments&quot; on a codebase.
  
Imagine being dropped into a new codebase and having the freedom to leave whatever todo items and breadcrumbs you want without cluttering the codebase. Imagine working on a client’s codebase and not having to worry about what you say, or who sees it.
  
I fully documented what it&#x27;d take to write a plugin for your favorite editor and wrote an example plugin for vim ... and then I switched to emacs.
 My emacs lisp chops are NOT up to writing a plugin that speaks to this API and displays the private comments inline. I&#x27;m imagining something akin to how magit shows commit messages inline. 
 I&#x27;m tired of not having access to this in my main editor. 
 If you or someone you know would be interested in writing this for me (as a public open source package, which i&#x27;ll be happy to maintain) I&#x27;ll happily pay you, or maybe donate the equivalent amount to help folks in Ukraine if you&#x27;d prefer. DM me here (or @masukomi on twitter) with how much you&#x27;d want.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a long time vim user that converted (mostly to Emacs). I&#x27;m to the point where I only use vim in a few situations (quick edits, specific servers), and I&#x27;ve recreated my old vim config in emacs: 
  
Buffer management-ivy and fzf
 evil keys everywhere
 surround.vim-evil-surround
 vim commentary-evil-commentary
 persistent undo-undo-fu
 web-mode/php-mode
 lots of keybindings like 
  
(evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;ivy-switch-buffer) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;e&quot;) (lambda() (interactive)(find-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/init.el&quot;))) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;ww&quot;) (lambda() (interactive)(find-file &quot;~/notes.org&quot;))) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;DEL&quot; ) #&#x27;switch-to-last-buffer) 
 I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the workflow, but then I was satisfied with a pretty similar one in vim before. What stuff should I leverage that makes emacs superior to vim? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, elisp is a million times more pleasant than Vimscript and that alone makes a big difference. Oh, I do use magit and org already so maybe I have my answer. Curious if there are other vim converts out there who have words of wisdom on what else to try in emacs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a cv in org mode and I want to make a list of publications. The way my cv class works, I use description lists with a date and a description in org mode like this:
 - 2018--2022 :: Job at company 
 which exports to:
 \begin{description} \item[2018--2022] Job at company \end{description} 
 This is then formatted exactly how I like. I really don&#x27;t want to massively change the way this works, because it took me a long time to get the class just right, I&#x27;ve tried a few approaches (e.g. tables and tabularx) and this was the best way overall (so far).
 I want to be able to write this:
 - [cite:@key_20] - [cite:@otherkey_22] 
 and have it export like this (or equivalent):
 \begin{description} \item[2020] \cite{key_20} \item[2022] \cite{otherkey_22} \end{description} 
 where the dates in the square brackets for the \item macros are automatically pulled from the bib data associated with the relevant @key. (I realise \cite is probably not the best citation command to use here. I use biblatex so I&#x27;ll probably pick something reasonable from that package. The point is the date thing).
 How would anyone approach this? I&#x27;ve fiddled about a bit and can&#x27;t find a way yet.

 I have been toying around with the idea of trying out emacs for quite a while now and I really wanna give it a go now. However, I am completely lost and need guidance about how to actually use it.
 Any recommendations are very welcome.
 Thank you all in advance!

                              <span>Been using this to find files system wide, mostly random org file notes on things but it&#x27;s great. Just wondering what everyone else is doing for a fuzzy file search, like ctrl-p in vim? The cool thing about this is you can select the folder before the search which means it&#x27;s not going to just crawl your entire user folder etc.
 Anyway what&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s approach to this?

                              <span>I currently have a global keybind set up so that I can open org-agenda, that works all fine, opening the menu with all the optiosn (a,t,m etc.) but I find myself using the n option (agenda and all TODOs) more than anything else, and I would like to bind that to a separate keybind.
 This would be trivial if I just wanted to run org-agenda-list (a) but since the option I want is part of the org-agenda-custom-commands and has no direct function associated to it I don&#x27;t know how to do this.
 Any help is welcomed!

                              <span>A bit of a weird one, but I regularly want to know how much time I&#x27;ve spent today in total including the time spent on the current clocked in task (basically, when I&#x27;m checking if I&#x27;ve done enough hours for the day). I could always clock out and then clock in again but that&#x27;s a bit annoying.
 Does anyone have a good way of getting org-mode&#x27;s clock tables to include the current time in?

                              <span>By &quot;something between&quot;, I mean something minimal, but a little bit of color, like just two or three font colors for levels. And this entire question could be broadened out to any other distinguishing font differences between levels.
 I&#x27;m asking this because I&#x27;m new and I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m fooling myself that font colored levels does anything good. When I &quot;discovered&quot; themes and faces, I got pretty excited at the eye candy. At first, it looked really nice and seemed like a good idea. But now, idk.
 I&#x27;m curious, how many org mode level-colors (or other font attributes for levels) do you have? What does your different font attributes for levels mean?

                              <span>I use .emacs-custom.el to contain the customizations made by the interactive functions. However, I&#x27;d like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn&#x27;t work. Namely, I pulled out these:
 &#x27;(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;)))) &#x27;(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground &quot;#FF33FF&quot;)))) &#x27;(org-warning ((t (:background &quot;#ffffa0&quot; :foreground &quot;#ff33ff&quot; :weight normal)))) 
 Why don&#x27;t these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).
 EDIT: Ok I see I&#x27;m supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn&#x27;t work
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;)))) 
 EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-todo nil :box &#x27;(:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :weight &#x27;normal :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;) 
 And it probably didn&#x27;t work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don&#x27;t know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.

                              <span>As part of my workflow I have 2 scenarios I do most of the time when using magit:
 - Commit, rebase from master then force push to my own branch
 - Commit then squash the new commit with the previous commit, rebase from master, force push to my own branch
 I wonder if there is a way to automate these scenarios with magit to then use just one key combination?

                              <span>For anyone who uses org-mode to take notes (especially in uni), do you treat an org file as a single note or as an entire notebook? It would be nice to see what other people are doing so I can (possibly) adjust my note-taking strategy.
 Edit my current strategy is: ~/Notes////
 For example ~/Notes/Spring_2022/MAT2440/week6/wednesday_march_9_2022.org
 and ~/Notes is a git repo so I can keep it in sync with my desktop at home (as I have some hybrid (online and in-person) classes and need to keep them in both places)

 i just cant understand why our sbt doesnt have this &quot;ordinary&quot; feature that gem, npm, yarn, poetry, etc have...
 why cant we just run something like &quot;sbt install github.path.to.package --save&quot;?

                              <span>I started to mature as a emacs users, so now I am trying to start developing things. 
 I notice that I encounter familiar name often. Once that comes to mind right now is /u/github-alphapapa and I also encounter this repo from /u/akirakom (https://github.com/akirak). 
 After looking into those repo, I figured out that these guys have solved problem that I had, am having, and don&#x27;t even know that I have. 
 So I am now trying to gather all repos from these &quot;emacs super developers&quot;, so I can study their code, understand problem that bother them, understand how they solve problem and one day be good enough to continuously contribute to the community. 
 Thank you in advance.

 i want a variable that is unique to this heading something like a category so when there

                              <span>So I don&#x27;t do a lot of heaving coding, but I do embedded code in C/C++, scripts in Python and play with Racket/Lisp when time permits. I&#x27;ve been using VS code for work, but in school we used a very basic setup for Java programming in Emacs and I enjoyed using Emacs (I don&#x27;t do Java programming though).
 I want to really learn Emacs and have gone through the basic tutorials. I want to start adding packages but it all seems so overwhelming to me. I&#x27;d like to add a package at a time to my basically blank configuration.
 Can anyone recommend just the basic packages I should have to do C/C++ and Python until I learn how to use those? I&#x27;d like the basic IDE stuff like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, file differences and a file tree. Recommendations? What else should I have?

                              <span>I use BetterBibTex and Zotero to export my bibliography + files + notes. Is there a quick way to extract the note field from the .bib file to a standalone orgmode file and convert its formatting to orgmode? Ideally with the file containing the citekey as well.
 I assume the simplest way would be to copy the content from the field, create a new buffer, paste the content to the new buffer, then export it to orgmode. But this also seems like a lot of work and I&#x27;d like to automate it if possible.
 Additional question for org-roam! I&#x27;d like to turn each reference into a node, so I can track each to what references I end up using more, which I tend to co-use, etc. Is there a good way to find every citekey in my bibliography, convert into something that org-ref, org-cite, citar, whatever can understand, and export them as nodes in one file with the citekey being in the :roam-refs: field?

                              <span>Does org-mode/emacs have a good to represent historical timelines.
 I am starting study on history and philosophy, and want to be able to easily keep track of dates, events, birth-to-death of individuals, birth-to-death of nations etc. 
 Wikipedia does it using multiple pages for different timescales
  
Timelines_of_world_history
 Timelines_of_modern_history
 Timeline_of_the_17th_century
 1630s
  
My goal is to have navigable timeline to quickly find items of relevance. Is the above Wikipedia method the best available. Is there a mode that would help manage this?
 Also I want to use something similar to time.graphics for visualisation. It&#x27;s quite expensive though. 
 Do you have any ideas, on how I should visualise timelines?

                              <span>I have enabled org-encrypt for my journal files to keep certain things private and this works well but I recently noticed that after saving the file and its contents encrypted and I undo the last change to the file, the entire contents of the file is revealed without being prompted for a password. This happens even after waiting for a long time. I would expect to be prompted for a password each time the encrypted contents is to be shown but this is not the case. Is this the expected behavior? If not, how do I prevent it from happening?

                              <span>Hi, 
 Trying to use &quot;assertThrows&quot; as I&#x27;m trying to learn about unit testing, but I&#x27;m stuck. I made a simple calculator and wrote some tests to test them, they are all fine, simply using assert, but as soon as I want to test that an exception is supposed to be thrown, the test fails with the following error message:
 type mismatch; found : org.scalatest.Assertion (which expands to) org.scalatest.compatible.Assertion required: Int assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) 
 Here is the code I&#x27;m using:
 import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec import calctest.Calculator object ScalaTestingStyles class CalculatorSuite extends AnyFlatSpec { val calculator &#x3D; new Calculator &quot;Calculator&quot; should &quot;add two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.add(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 15 ) } it should &quot;subtract two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.subtract(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 5 ) } it should &quot;multiply two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.multiply(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 50 ) } it should &quot;divide two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.divide(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 2 ) } it should &quot;Throw an exception if denominator is zero&quot; { assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) } } 
 And here is my simple calculator:
 class Calculator { def add(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a + b def subtract(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a - b def multiply(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a * b def divide(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a / b } 
 It&#x27;s the last test that is failing, this was part of a rock the JVM tutorial, but instead of funspec I&#x27;m trying to learn flatspec. Why is this failing please?

 Map(&quot;a&quot; -&gt; 1, &quot;k&quot; -&gt;5, &quot;b&quot; -&gt; 5, &quot;t&quot;-&gt;5, &quot;d&quot;-&gt; 3) 
 to 
 TreeMap(5 -&gt; List(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), 3 -&gt; List(&quot;d&quot;), 1 -&gt; List(&quot;a&quot;))
 using the Map APIs like groupBy, groupMapReduce etc 
 ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been studying FP for a while now in my spare time, mostly in Scala and TypeScript. I&#x27;ve gotten very deep into it. I feel I have a strong understanding of all the core concepts, as well as all the most common monads and other main design patterns. In short, I feel like I&#x27;ve got a very solid grasp of programming in FP.
 My problem lately just comes down to putting it all together at scale. Whenever I&#x27;ve tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven&#x27;t been really happy with the results.
 What I&#x27;m hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it&#x27;s been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).
 On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those &quot;This is a functor&quot; type FP courses, I don&#x27;t need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I&#x27;m after.
 Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.

                              <span>Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? 
 The reason I&#x27;m asking for that is I&#x27;m porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... 
 A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by &quot;tag&quot; (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically 
 This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.
 The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be &quot;resolved&quot; later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don&#x27;t have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.
 EDIT: fix typos

 We built it to help all people living in oppressive regimes communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with.
 During the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people of both countries – I have friends and family there – could be at risk when sharing their opinions or just from being connected to people who were prosecuted.
 Every messenger app that knows who you are can end up sharing all of your connections with undesirable third parties, either as a result of a court order or as a result of attack - so even Signal, which has strong encryption, cannot protect your connection graph.
 Huge &quot;thank you&quot; 🙏 to 137 people who helped us test and improve the apps and to u/angerman who helped a lot by compiling our Haskell code to mobile platforms and getting it accepted by app stores – and we have just submitted the release than makes the app working on iPhone 7.
 From our experience – building mobile apps with Haskell is non-trivial but doable – so if you have complex client-side logic that benefits from the advanced type system, then Haskell is a viable choice – we hope our project makes it a bit better for others too.
 Let us know what you think about the apps and we are looking forward to releasing the new features, e.g. e2e encrypted WebRTC audio/video calls – see the full release announcement here.

Does anyone have ideas or samples that I could follow?
In the instance I&#x27;m currently exploring, OPML files are the intermediary between the ZK and, in this case, iThoughtsX.
The trick will be to get correct OPML file formatting as an output via Marked 2, python, applescript or Keyboard Maestro.
Check this out for a first rough go. So far only one level thick. But this was easy. Each link on the central node is a child node on the mindmap. The full text of each child node is attached. Links within the text are not hot, but we&#x27;ll see. 
I&#x27;ve attached the file so you can download, review, and explore the ideas. Requires an app that will read iThoughtsX files. This type of download might be a way of sharing a specific idea thread from my ZK with the world.</span>

                              <span>Hello,
I would rather use a link-as-search to be as future proof and software agnostic as possible. I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?
I saw that a &quot;#&quot; was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?
Thank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I a newbie at haskell and I am trying to learn it using a book -&gt; learn haskell from first principles and in this book I came across a function
 addAndDrop &#x3D; const . (1+)
 Can anyone please explain how is this working
 Afaik (.) Operator takes two functions and compose them but the composition operator takes function that takes 1 input and one output but const take two inputs, then how is it working?

 As a user, I am quite thrilled about named routes, as well as another change in Servant 0.19 brought by our team at Tweag (this time driven by Andrea Condoluci): better error messages for faulty routes. Writing routes in a type-level DSL can be tricky because errors can get hairy, and you lose a lot of the benefits of interacting with GHC&#x27;s type checker. Both of these changes should help make Servant APIs more manageable, and more accessible to newcomers.

                              <span>I have the following code:
 insertOrd :: (a, b) -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; [(a, b)] insertOrd x xs &#x3D; x : xs insertFlipped :: (b, a) -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; [(a, b)] insertFlipped x xs &#x3D; flipped x : xs where flipped (a, b) &#x3D; (b, a) 
 What I want to do is to define a function insert that will run the appropriate version of insertXXX based on the type of the first argument, imagine something like the following:
 insert :: pair -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; [(a, b)] insert &#x3D; case typeOf pair of (a, b) -&gt; insertOrd (b, a) -&gt; insertFlipped _ -&gt; fail_during_compilation 
 Of course, that code is not valid Haskell, but I was wondering if I could achieve something like that using some type-level magic.
 Thanks in advance for any suggestion!

                              <span>I am pretty new to Haskell and learning it for fun, coming from Python. I recently tried to solve a problem using memoization, and I was surprised how hard it is in Haskell. I read up on a few things, for example
 https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Fix_and_recursion
 that provides the basic concepts. Naively, I had assumed that pure functional programming language should make memoization *easier* as there are no unintended side-effects. Instead, basically every approach I found requires me rewrite the function definition itself of the function I want to memoize. 
 Am I simply missing something? Are there some techniques for memoization that don&#x27;t require rewriting the function? Maybe some compiler settings?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m reading &quot;Thinking functionally with Haskell&quot; chapter 2. I have questions about Exercise D in Chapter 2.
 The first part of the question was easy to understand. It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression
 head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.
 -&gt; With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.
 -&gt; With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to
 let p &#x3D; map f xs in head (p)
 which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 
 ​
 In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.
 filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. 
 In the question I&#x27;m having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. 
 How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. 
 Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?

 Whenever I use evil-mode and when I select some text and move/indent it with &quot;&quot; , in mini-buffer there is message Wrong type argument: wholenump, nil Should that concern me? 
 Currently, this fix is placed outside of mine use-package config of evil-mode. Could that be the reason of the message in mini-buffer? It would be nice if I could place this fix inside of my use-package evil-mode config.
 Here is chunk of code from my init.el : LINK
 Thanks in advance,

 Btw, I am currently using emacs-plus@27, I think.

                              <span>Hi,
 A very strange situation here. When I launch the client from the terminal using emacsclient -c, the client launches with the terminal showing a message Waiting for Emacs.... However, when I use a .desktop file it fails to launch! Curiously, when I set Terminal&#x3D;true in the .desktop, it works. Any idea what&#x27;s going wrong? Thanks!
 EDIT: Terminal&#x3D;false -&gt; Terminal&#x3D;true

                              <span>Hi there,
 I was wondering whether anyone had experimented with a custom icalendar org template. I see that there is the gnus-icalendar-insinuate-org-templates function. I also notice there is a key that is used, but I don&#x27;t think changing the key to one that is linked to a custom template would work. 
 What is your setup with gnu-icalendar? 
 Best,
 Enrique.

 (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;something) 
 Tracking back a bit, I was wondering why .dir.locals were not being read, and it was because of the hook failure - all later hooks were being halted as a result, so it was not reading .dir.locals. I was only able to notice that by going to the *Messages* buffer.
 Is there a way to configure Emacs to throw an error when a hook fails? That would be much better for debugging and for making any errors obvious. I don&#x27;t want to be lenient to hook failures.

                              <span>A very annoying issue with desktop-save and desktop-read that I&#x27;m encountering at the moment:
  
I&#x27;m starting Emacs in daemon-mode, and then open a client frame. I do &#x27;desktop-read&#x27; and my saved desktop opens with the 10 or so frames I had saved.
 
When I go to one of the frames with a buffer I&#x27;m no longer interested in, and do C-x C-c, I end up not just closing that particular frame, but all 10 or so of the frames that were open.
 
The Emacs daemon is still running, and opening another client frame shows that the buffers haven&#x27;t been killed, so nothing has been lost per se - it&#x27;s just that the arrangement of all the frames I had is just ruined.
 
 Any idea how to stop this behaviour (i.e. being able to just kill one frame from the saved configuration)? 
 I should add that I have also been using the minimal setup for desktop.el as shown in the EmacsWiki, but I /think/ (but am not sure) that the problem is independent of this.

                              <span>Hello ,
 I&#x27;m looking to write a function, for my role-playing games, allowing me to create random tables with elements that have weight.
 For example, consider the following list:
 1 - 20 : 2d6 kobold
 21 - 45 : 1 troll
 46 - 100 : 3d6 orcs
 Running the function I want to be able to pick 20% of the time the &quot;2d6 kobold&quot; etc.
 Ideally, the function would allow me to automatically execute the dice roll. I will have then, for example: 5 kobolds!
 Not being a programmer, all I can do is create a function to select an item from a &quot;flat&quot; list.
 Any idea?

But it doesn&#x27;t show up as an M-x command and it doesn&#x27;t show up in the help system.

 I would like help getting this to work, or at least understanding why &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work that way&quot;.
 (I know I can just call C-u C-RET to accomplish the same thing, but I&#x27;m learning elisp and I did the above work first, so I&#x27;d like to know why it doesn&#x27;t work.)

 I&#x27;m genuinely curious, why is it that these features aren&#x27;t well performing if so many people use Emacs as a file browser too?
 EDIT: ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED (mostly) My pdf-tools install didn&#x27;t seem to work properly, I have fixed it now and it is a lot better. Some things still are a bit clunky, but it definitely is a lot faster better now!

                              <span>Hi! I cannot figure out this bug, and do not know where I&#x27;d start. Whenever packages are installed I sometimes get autoloads that look sorta like this:
 (custom-autoload &#x27;async-bytecomp-package-mode &quot;async-bytecomp&quot; nil)
 (autoload &#x27;async-bytecomp-package-mode &quot;async-bytecomp&quot; &quot;\
 (&quot;Byte compile asynchronously packages installed with package.el.
 Async compilation of packages can be controlled by
 \async-bytecomp-allowed-packages&#x27;.&#x60;
 &#x60;If called interactively, enable Async-Bytecomp-Package&#x60; &#x60;mode if ARG is positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or&#x60; &#x60;negative. If called from Lisp, also enable the mode if&#x60; &#x60;ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is \&#x60;toggle&#x27;;&#x60; &#x60;disable the mode otherwise.&#x60; 
 \(fn &amp;optional ARG)&quot; 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default)) t nil)
 The (&quot; starting on line 3 and the snippet
 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default))
 break autoloads for all sorts of packages in a way that is hard to track down (paren/quote mismatch leads to invalid autoloads for rest of the file).
 The snippet does not always feature the same numbers. Example:
 34 35 (face default) 91 92 (face default) 148 149 (face default) 201 202 (face default) 260 261 (face default))
 ...any ideas on this? These snippets have appeared in a wide number of autoload files-- magit, org-roam, valign, some ivy rich packages, etc. They do not appear in the upstream git repositories.
 ​
 They also reappear on package update, breaking large swathes of functionality.

                              <span>Hi, just trying to learn how to do testing and stuck at the very first hurdle. I&#x27;ve added build dependencies to the build.sbt file but still scalatest is highlighted in red by intellij. How is this supposed to be done please, I&#x27;ve no idea what else needs to be in place and there is nothing on google hence posting here for some insight

                              <span>I have a hot key associated with the #proofing Saved Search. After the last update the hotkey now triggers the saved search in all tabs and all the multiple windows that are open rather than just the one with the focus.

Last Week
Wrote a scientist profile using The Archive and Marked2
Created a Poetry of Zettelkasting video showing how I use The Archive and Marked2 in my writing
Studied and became more familiar with the writer tools in Marked2
Read The Secret to Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel, a graphic autobiography. ★★★★★
Didn&#x27;t re-engage with woodworking like I said I would last week. I&#x27;m trying again this week.
This Week
Refactoring Meditations on Self-Discipline 201901021303 from 90% quotes to 90% my assimilation of the quotes meaning. This book I onboarded at the beginning of my ZK journey. So I&#x27;ve spent about 10 hours over the last couple of weeks on this. It is a rewarding time spent refactoring this series of 30 notes—only a few more to go. &quot;Ferraiolo, William. Meditations on Self-Discipline and Failure: Stoic Exercise for Mental Fitness. O Books, 2017.&quot;
Reading and onboarding &quot;Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021.&quot;
Spring Break, so no JAMM328 assignments
Re-engage with woodworking. Maybe having a tie-in with my ZK might help motivate me. Thanks, @sfast, for the link to a beautiful ZK cabinet.</span>

                              <span>Sorry to ask this here, I couldn&#x27;t find the setting in the readme.
 When I finish typing any word in SLIME and go to push enter, it has already loaded the &quot;no matches, so here&#x27;s everything&quot; list of completions, so I need to move back a character and forward just to get rid of the list. It&#x27;s killing me.
 Here&#x27;s an example picture, me typing &#x27;foo, and the list loads for... some reason?

                              <span>Hi I am trying to bind multiple keys for a toggle of bookmarks, but I cant really figure out how to do that. What I want is M-b-b for toggle bookmarks.
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-b-b&quot;) #&#x27;bm-toggle) but that doesnt work because: &quot;M- must prefix a single character, not b-b&quot;
 I tried multiple combinations, like &quot;M-b M-b&quot; but without any success. Is it possible to do this with global-set-key or even the :bind in use-package?
 M &#x3D; Meta key

 I was just wondering out of all the FRP libraries, which one is the most effective and up-to-date? My undergraduate thesis will likely be concerning FRP in Haskell to generate music.

                              <span>I think one of the massively underrated use cases of Haskell is as a tool for discussion. For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). 
 Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?
 I blogged about it here (if you are interested in more detail of our XP session and some code snips etc) https://www.tomwells.org/blog/haskell_for_prototyping

                              <span>Having previously worked with python, java, C and javascript I have developed some personal preferences for features/styles in programming languages that don&#x27;t seem to be supported in more modern popular and low-level languages (Go and Rust).
 I&#x27;m wondering if these patterns are incorrect or if I&#x27;m attempting to use an object-orientated or functional style in a procedural language where it doesn&#x27;t fit.
 The following are a few of my favourites that initially sprung to mind.
  
Chained operations on arrays/lists with functionally defined behaviour e.g. a.filter(a &#x3D;&gt; a &gt; 5).sort().slice(2).max()
 Wrapper alternatives to checking for null. e.g. extending the previous example ...2).max().else(0)
 Inline everything. e.g. if a is b then c() else d() and for 1..X as x do a +&#x3D; x
  
Am I a functional programmer in denial? The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.
 Or do I just want what&#x27;s bad for me? In support of this is the fact that all the languages that allow these patterns are very generic and mainstream and don&#x27;t have the careful direction of your Gos and rusts.

 This theme looks good, but I hate the fact that&#x27;s in white - burns my eyes
 ​
 I like [DT&#x27;s theme](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/distro.tube ) &#x27;s theme - but how do i get his particular dark theme? Sorry if this is a very specific question...
 ​
 ​
 If not, is there any other place where i can just get the link for the theme, and apply it , like the one in the pic?

                              <span>I code in Python (which demands perfect indentation).
 ​
 Why would the cursor go all the way there?
 ​
 This happens in certain code blocks - when i insert a code block NOT inside a bullet the indentation seems perfect though.
 ​
 I know there&#x27;s _probably_ a really simple config i have to tweak in my config.el ( I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs ), but forgive me , I just have no clue 😅
 ​
 Oh , and i use Arch btw 
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been mentioning here and there that I wanted to assemble a (book) outline or two since Christmas, but so far, no progress.
So to create more leverage through peer pressure, I&#x27;m going to share progress here.
The topic is an open source library I&#x27;m a co-maintainer of for a couple of years now. https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift
The general idea of the library may survive, but the library itself is likely about to become obsolete in 1--3 years because of technical changes. That&#x27;s why I want to do something with this, anything really, before it can only go straight to the trash. (Aka the sub-conscious of the Zettelkasten through forgetting about it.)

                              <span>Hey Emacsers,
 How are you doing?
 I&#x27;m getting excited about this post because when I understood how hl-line-mode works, it opened new horizons for me in the world of Elisp.
 I hope you will feel the same way after:
  
reading this post or,
 by directly reading the source code of hl-line-mode that can be found in the file lisp/hl-line.el (only 205 LOC skipping comments and empty lines).
  
You can get emacs&#x27;s source code by running the following command:
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git 
 (This post will soon be added in Org format to https://github.com/tonyaldon/posts).

 Below function from embark library gets executed when I press embark-act after selecting a file
 (defun embark--ivy-selected () &quot;Target the currently selected item in Ivy. Return the category metadatum as the type of the target.&quot; ;; my favorite way of detecting Ivy (when (memq &#x27;ivy--queue-exhibit post-command-hook) (cons (completion-metadata-get (embark--metadata) &#x27;category) (ivy--expand-file-name (if (and (&gt; ivy--length 0) (stringp (ivy-state-current ivy-last))) (ivy-state-current ivy-last) ivy-text))))) 
 I debugged an found that the following expression is returning nil
 (completion-metadata-get (embark--metadata) &#x27;category) 
 Not sure what am I missing.

 After exporting an archive from Simplenote (Settings → Tools → Export Notes) and installing this package, run org-import-simplenote then select the downloaded archive. Every note (that isn&#x27;t trashed) will be imported as an Org heading, complete with the creation timestamp.
 The creation timestamp is used as the headline; I might add an option to use the first line of the note content instead, like how Simplenote itself displays notes.

                              <span>Last week, I released my new emacs package zetteldesk.el and made a post here for showcasing it. The idea was rather well accepted but I got a lot of feedback, that the README was too dense in information and it was hard for a new user to try it. I have tried fixing this, by integrating gifs for demonstrations instead of the raw info (which I moved to the wiki for anyone wanting it), adding a set of default bindings in the form of a hydra and a small sample config to get you started.
 ​
 I believe some people might have been set off by those problems, so I wanted to say thank you for pointing them out. I would love to hear what you think of it now, that I have tried to make it more explanative and if it is truly easier for someone to get started with it.
 ​
 As I said in the other post, I am very new to this, so I really appreciate and listen to feedback, as I feel the idea itself is good, but some parts of the implementation may be lacking, and who better to help me than the community.
 ​
 Thank you all for helping,
 Best regards,
 Vidianos

 I&#x27;m looking for a way to set a keybinding to switch the current active buffer to a specific one. In my case, it would be something like &quot;C-c p&quot; to switch to my Python run (*Python* buffer). Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find an example so far... Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you a lot in advance!

 Is there a solution to this in Scala 2.x? Thanks?

                              <span>TL;DR - I have ADHD...my desk is a mess, my emacs is a mess, my life is a mess. HEEEEELP!
 Let me start by apologizing for this long ass post. I&#x27;m having trouble articulating what I want. 
 I am using Doom Emacs.
 There are two things I have been trying to figure out how to do. They are probably very simple but I can&#x27;t seem to word them correctly in text so I am having trouble finding solutions. 
 I have ADHD, so things become very messy very quickly. If I don&#x27;t lay things out a certain way I can become distracted and/or lose interest. One way to prevent this is by adding some flair to whatever I am doing. Does anyone have an easy way to add some style to an org document? Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.
 Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I&#x27;d like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.
 Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don&#x27;t expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I&#x27;d shoot my shot.

                              <span>ssh-deploy is a way to do coding on local machine and deploy on remote machine. Essentially, it keeps a local directory and a remote directory in sync by doing rsync on file save. 
 magit probably needs no introduction.
 While I find ssh-deploy really really useful, I observed that making changes using magit, such as deleting a hunk in a file or changing a branch (thereby changing files or file contents), the changes are understandably not propagated to remote dir.
 I am no lisp expert, but took up the challenge to get something working with my setup for these usecases:

                              <span>EDIT: THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED. (github questions moved to the github subreddit in this post). 
  
I&#x27;m just trying to get &quot;my feet wet&quot; a bit in browsing elisp and github. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a local variable, being used only right there? That&#x27;s Question1.
 Question2: So also, why does my search on github not find the reference for &quot;ctf&quot; in org.el? On github, I&#x27;ve set the repository to 
  
emacs-mirror
 mirrored from git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
  
Then in the upper left search text box, I do a &quot;search in this repository&quot; for ctf. It only gives me two files:
 test/lisp/epg-resources/seckey.asc
 doc/misc/mh-e.texi
 Question3: Why doesn&#x27;t it also list org.el? Am I misunderstanding that search function? I was looking for any other references to &quot;ctf&quot; in the code base. 
 So that&#x27;s my final question (Question4), is how do I find all occurrences of something in a repository using github web interface?

                              <span>In windows I did this using an AutoHotKey script that chekced if an emacs&#x27; instance was running, and if so, it would make tha caps lock a ctrl key, but in linux I have no idea how to do it. I know how to remap a key for the whole system, just not for only an emacs instance... any idea?

                              <span>I do a lot of literate programming and I feel a little bit annoying the fact that I could not find an easy way of using imenu list for the language I&#x27;m developing in.
 I have a project in common lisp, and I wrote this function
 (defun imenu-literate (src-edit?) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((imenu-generic-expression lisp-imenu-generic-expression) (imenu-create-index-function #&#x27;imenu-default-create-index-function)) (imenu-list-update-safe) (imenu-list-refresh) (call-interactively #&#x27;imenu) (when src-edit? (org-edit-special)))) 
 which is fair enough to understand and works but it sure feels like a Hack. Moreover I&#x27;d like to use this for more languages and I&#x27;d like to set the underlying mode through org mode as a pragma.
 But since this would be so convenient I wanted to ask if there is already something like this and I don&#x27;t have to invent a new wheel.
 Cheers!

 I built up a menu based on the M-o prefix key, but maybe it is not the best one.
 Could you advice me a free or rarely used key to use as a prefix-key ?

                              <span>Hi, I encountered these two lines while reading Purcell&#x27;s config. My main problem is not knowing the differences between &quot;making packages available&quot;, &quot;loading packages&quot;, and &quot;activating packages&quot;.
  
 From the docs, (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) doesn&#x27;t &quot;make installed packages available when Emacs starts&quot;. So, does &quot;installed packages&quot; here refer to packages found in load-path? Also, what does it mean for a package to be &quot;available&quot;? Such that (require &#x27;package) will work?
  
 Then, (package-initialize) will &quot;load Emacs Lisp packages, and activate them&quot;. So what do &quot;loading&quot; and &quot;activating&quot; here mean? Does &quot;loading&quot; here mean the same thing as (load FILE)? Then &quot;activating&quot; means (provide FEATURE)?
  
 I&#x27;ve tried reading Elisp Packaging Section but still couldn&#x27;t understand

 Just install and call flyspell-toggle-transient-squiggle
 (defvar flyspell-transient-squiggle nil) (defun flyspell-toggle-transient-squiggle () (interactive) (setq flyspell-transient-squiggle (not flyspell-transient-squiggle)) (message &quot;Flyspell transient squiggle: %S&quot; flyspell-transient-squiggle)) (defun nuke-flyspell-squiggles (buf) (with-current-buffer buf (flyspell-delete-all-overlays))) (defadvice make-flyspell-overlay (around transient-flyspell-squiggle activate) ad-do-it (when flyspell-transient-squiggle (run-at-time &quot;3 sec&quot; nil &#x27;nuke-flyspell-squiggles (current-buffer))))

 Also, is there a way to pick a different color for the table header | Word | Phonetic Transcription | something like&quot;: black background with white text? and for even lines add a gray color like #ccc?

                              <span>I posted this about a week ago, but was asked to separate the questions by a mod.
 As the title implies, can you adjust Org to accept lower and upper case if you have &quot;TODO(a)&quot;, for example if org-use-fast-todo-selection &#x27;auto? Or adjust it to work like org-capture, so it doesn&#x27;t quit if A was pressed?

 When I type C-h k C-c C-o I verify that this function is bound.
 When my point is on a headline, the function generates a UUID in a new PROPERTIES drawer. The output at the bottom of the screen says &quot;running less /home//org/data//some-other-uuid&quot;
 The interactive documentation says that a list of links should be displayed so that I can choose the one I want.
 Any ideas?

 https://github.com/crinklywrappr/rivendell/blob/update-for-0.17/test.org
 ​
 I plan to switch all of the files to org-mode and use org-babel-tangle&#x60; to generate the source files.
 ​
 I would like to clean it up a bit - make it look more professional. It&#x27;s missing a TOC and I have to specify the output file for every source code block. Any suggestions for improvement are appreciated.

                              <span>Since in my last Scala job we agreed that functions will be separate from data, I have often felt the urge to make many (most?) of those functions into extension methods. However, I felt it would introduce a bunch of boilerplate code that is not really necessary in any way.
 Now with syntax changes in Scala 3 generally, and also with the dedicated syntax for extension methods I don&#x27;t see any reason anymore to not write code this way. Feels like the best of both words.
 Can you think of any reason why that would be a bad idea. While I don&#x27;t have this problem right now, I can hardly imagine reviewers being content with such code in PRs, though I can&#x27;t see a reason for objections either.

                              <span>Hello again community! I&#x27;ve posted a few days before, some questions about diving into Scala.js, and thankfully I received great answers and I am continuing my research!
 Today I was trying to debug Scala.js within an IDE (both IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and VSCode).
 I&#x27;ve read some posts/issues/jetbrains issues but all of them are older (2016-17 era), but the most they managed to get is in-browser debugging.
 As years passed, is there a way to properly debug through an IDE?
 Also afaik debugging depends on sourcemaps, so does error tracking libraries such as Sentry. Is it possible to properly error track Scala.js?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m new to Haskell and trying to wrap my head around it, coming from imperative languages it&#x27;s so different I might as well have never coded in my life. I find the syntax... strange, to say the least.
 I&#x27;m trying to understand a solution for a function that detects if a String is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet), here it is :
  isPangram text &#x3D; all (&#x60;elem&#x60; text) [&#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27;] 
 What I don&#x27;t understand are those parentheses, they don&#x27;t make sense to me. 
 As far as I can tell, elem takes 2 arguments; a character then a string. So what does (elem text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (elem text) doesn&#x27;t actually work on its own, so what is going on here?
 Also, all takes a list of booleans right? Assuming all is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (elem text) [&#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27;] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn&#x27;t work on its own. Where is the list of booleans all is applied to coming from, then?

                              <span>One thing I realized today from reading Johannes Schmidt’s paper1 is this:
In Luhmann’s second ZK:
Luhmann had 67,000 Main Notes (aka, Permanent Notes)
And he had 15,000 Literature Notecards in his bibliography (usually with about 10-15 bullet points of thoughts and page numbers per book or article he read).
This means for each book or article he read, he only creates on average 4 to 5 main notes.
The other bullet points (like the other 10 bullet points) he would just make references to the book and page numbers.
He would go to a card about Ideology for instance and write “For more on Ideology, see Williamson p. 256” for instance.
I think there’s an assumption out there that one ought develop every bullet point literature note they take.
Any thoughts on this?

                              <span>Is there a package which automatically and intelligently rewrites variable-name to variableName or variable_name depending on the current major language mode? It should be intelligent enough to account for cases where you&#x27;re typing within the bounds of string quotes. The more I think about this problem the more difficult I think it would be to write such a package --- perhaps none exists.
 As an example, let&#x27;s suppose we&#x27;re writing Python (with | as the cursor):
 Basic:
  
variable-name|
 variable-name |
 variable_name | (conversion performed)
  
In quotes:
  
variable_name &#x27;foo-bar|
 variable_name &#x27;foo-bar |
 variable_name &#x27;foo-bar | (no conversion as the user is typing within quotes)
  
In f-string:
  
variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar-baz|
 variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar-baz |
 variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar_baz | (conversion performed)

                              <span>I often get overwhelmed at the number of things in my TODO list, and end up avoiding looking at it at all.
 I would like to be able to limit the number of TODO&#x27;s displayed there (say 5 TODO&#x27;s), and some way of moving to next/previous 5.
 Is it possible to do it in the regular org-todo-list view?
 Do I need a custom view? if so, how would I do it?

                              <span>Is there any way to separately define bindings for when the right alt/ctrl keys are used as qualifiers (ie treat them differently than the left ones)? google didn&#x27;t provide an obvious answer.
 I never use those keys. I would like to define at least one of them with a whole lot of bindings for entering unicode symbols (for instance, right-alt-A as the &quot;alpha&quot; symbol). I assume I&#x27;d want to set them up to act as &quot;super&quot; or &quot;hyper&quot; in emacs lingo.
 This is under windows, but I&#x27;m also interested in doing the same thing when I&#x27;m running emacs on an AWS linux box (via XMinG under windows).

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering transitioning from Joplin to something else because of Joplin&#x27;s use of a database to manage note, which I think is bloated and unnecessary. However, there are some things that I&#x27;m still not sure about when it comes to Org-mode.
  
Is there support for embedded images? (like markdown&#x27;s ![]() image links)
 Is there a reliable way to view/edit Org files on android? Viewing should be rendered, with embedded images, not as plain text.

                              <span>Been digging through documentation and searching the interwebs for the past couple days, looking for a solution but without much luck. The problem is this:
 I tend to have electric-quote-mode enabled when working with text and org files, for the sake of the typographic curly quotes, and I noticed that functions like forward-word and count-words-region are &quot;fooled&quot; into thinking that possessives and contractions are two words instead of one whenever the Right Single Quotation Mark (0x2019) appears inside a word as an apostrophe, becoming a &quot;separator&quot; rather than just part of the word itself.
 The straight-quote apostrophe (0x27) doesn&#x27;t seem to have this problem. I found out that it&#x27;s defined in the text-mode syntax table as a word constituent, so naturally I figured the easy fix would be …</span>

                              <span>Dear community, 
 I have a quick question regarding multiple selections with consult: Helm Buffer has a feature which allows selecting multiple buffers via C-SPC in order to kill those at once with M-D (see here). Does consult-buffer provide a comparable feature? If so, how could I access it? 
 Furthermore, I would like to generalize the question: Given any consult-* command, how can I select multiple items and act on those with the help of embark?
 Thanks in advance!

 I was going to post there, but I think this is more of a general how to question.
 I have a shell script that I&#x27;ve been using as a template for my blog posts. I think, I could rework it to end up as an org file. But I recently watched a System Crafters video on org roam which talks about org-capture-template particularly the template in Org files bit
 if anyone cares about the script here&#x27;s the gist
 is there a way to make an org template for blog posts that would work like org-capture but store the file in path/to/jekyll/_posts
 TL;DR is there a way to make a chord to open an org template for blog posts?

                              <span>On behalf of maintainers I&#x27;m happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.3.0 has been released. It will be a part of upcoming GHC 9.2.2.
 The focus of this release is an extended API for ShortByteString, submitted by /u/maerwald as a part of Abstract FilePath Proposal. bytestring is proud to be a part of this initiative, aimed to provide much faster and more principled FilePath type. Huge thanks to /u/maerwald for spearheading it!
 Other highlights from the changelog:
  
UTF-8 support: add Data.ByteString.Short.isValidUtf8 and use safe FFI for large inputs.
 Improve performance and laziness of unlines.
 Improve performance of intercalate.
 Improve allocations of singleton.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:

 askeblad
 Ben Gamari
 Dmitry Ivanov
 Jaro Reinders
 Johannes Waldmann

On a personal note, it was not easy to work on this release with my family in a bomb shelter and friends in trenches. Stand with Ukraine, will you?

                              <span>Say we have routes: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data UsersRoutes route &#x3D; UserRoutes { usersId :: route :- Capture &quot;id&quot; Text :&gt; ToServant UserIdRoutes AsApi , usersAll :: route :- Get &#x27;[JSON] (Vector User) , ... }

 Then I want to extract client using:  UsersRoutes { usersId &#x3D; fromServant @_ @(AsClientT ClientM) -&gt; UserIdRoutes {..}, ..} &#x3D; genericClient @_ @ClientM 
 GHC politely tells me that fromServant cannot be applied to the pattern, because type mismatches.
 How can I distribute captured id to UserIdRoutes in convenient way when I want to extract client from UsersRoutes using pattern matching?

 It is a pet project of mine written a couple of weeks ago; it was originally for a friend but I felt it would be interesting to get some feedback from the Haskell community, feature requests and, why not, new contributors -- assuming the project is deemed interesting!
 As always, all comments welcome.

                              <span>Sorry if this is a duplicate! I searched the‍ subreddit but didn&#x27;t peer the same question. Is it possible to cache dependency builds with stack or cabal? My use case is creating a docker image that contains a working executable of our project. The build takes forever because of dependencies, it would be great to have it cached as another layer. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So years ago I did a project with Scala and really liked it, and now that I&#x27;m very into functional programming these days I&#x27;ve picked it up again through a course I&#x27;m taking on Akka. I&#x27;ve got a lot more experience with Java &amp; Kotlin than Scala, fyi.
 Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem &#x3D;&gt; Unit): Unit &#x3D; { val system &#x3D; ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;ActorSystem terminated&quot;)) } } 
 My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem(&quot;systemName&quot;, system &#x3D;&gt; { // Do stuff with the system }) } 
 There are two main issues that occur:
  
When I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.
 I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, &quot;io.me.akka&quot; part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.
  
I&#x27;m hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Thanks.

                              <span>From Luhmann&#x27;s article:

  
One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced in the respective other.
If...we seek communication with the second mind, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information).


In digging through the forums, it seems that some believe that Luhmann (and/or the community) overstates the importance of surprise in a Zettelkasten. If you are of this belief, can you enlighten me as to why you make this claim?</span>

                              <span>Hi,
I checked a lot of content on this topic and everyone seems to have his/her own idea on what a zettelkasten is and that makes things extremely confusing when trying to implement it.
I study a lot of computer science content and want to organise it but I am not sure exactly how many folders I should have(some people say two, some three, some four), for what purpose(fleeting notes, literature notes, permanent notes, hub)  and how the notes should be structured and linked.
I apologise if what I wrote above is vague but it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to phrase it.</span>

                              <span>I sometimes read papers and other PDFs on an Android tablet and I want to take notes, annotate or highlight etc.
 At the same time, I&#x27;m developing my note taking workflow using Org mode and Org Roam.
 What&#x27;s the best way to sync the two? I don&#x27;t have a preference for which Android app to use, as long as it allows me to take notes directly on the PDF in a way that can then easily be exported and integrated with the rest of my notes in Emacs.
 I don&#x27;t mind writing a little conversion script if necessary, e.g. to automatically insert some links to my org-roam nodes where possible.
 EDIT: should mention that the notes might also contain pictures

My name is David and for the past three months, Tweag has generously sponsored my work on criterion.rs1. Criterion.rs is a widely used (with nearly 1.4 million downloads in the last 90 days) benchmarking library for the Rust programming language which helps you measure the performance of your code and was inspired by its Haskell namesake2.
I’m a heavy user of criterion.rs as well as one of its maintainers, and three particular pain points have been sticking out like a sore thumb to me. These pain points affect a significant number of people while still being relatively easy to fix, making them, in my opinion, a great fit for Tweag’s Fellowship3 programme which aims to fund Open Source contributions.

 https://github.com/astoff/buffer-env
 The package works in a manner similar to the direnv program (and is mostly compatible with it). Moreover, it sets the environment variables buffer-locally, so once things are configured everything runs on autopilot and you don&#x27;t need to manually switch between different projects.

                              <span>I am trying to move away from spacemacs to my own config. But I want to have the packages that I have set up. I would like to move away from spacemacs for the sake of flexibility and control. Spacemacs is too late for some of the important items like native comp and their develop branch sometimes has bugs.
 I would like to minimize the changes in my workflow, if I cant keep them the same(keybindings et. al.). Replicating the same environment is proving to be cumbersome due to :
 - Spacemacs setup has too many packages, I am not even 1/4th of the way through and already the literate config is a couple of thousands of lines long.
 - I am used to the keybindings of spacemacs and replicating them is taking too much time. I have already built all the muscle memory and don&#x27;t want a different set of keys.
 - Going through all the documentation of the packages to get the exact setup as I had in spacemacs is very tricky. Sometimes spacemacs has some clever ways of handling things, which needs me to look into spacemacs code.
 - Going over spacemacs code is complex. I am now left with the feeling that I am replicating spacemacs code in my config.
 Has anyone felt the same? how have you dealt with this?

                              <span>Hi, I want to set up my personal development environment for C++ in emacs, and I have a few questions:
 I installed clangd and LSP, and if I open just one .cpp file it&#x27;s all good, but when I bring in multiple headers and files in different directories it doesn&#x27;t know where to find them (of course), how can I fix it? Also, I used to use makefiles, but I read that since clangd uses something called compile_commands.json and CMake can produce them, the latter would be a better option... the problem is that I don&#x27;t know how this whole interaction works and I can&#x27;t find a clear explanation about this on the internet. Lastly, is there a way to use only makefiles instead of CMake, or is it either impossible or impractical?

                              <span>Hi,
 When I export my markdown files, it&#x27;s plain text on markdown-mode but If I preview/export on VSCode, it colors everything including syntax highlighting with language aware colors. How do i achieve this on markdown-mode?
 Thanks

                              <span>I use tide for TypeScript files and in the ReactJS app, it shows errors but they don&#x27;t fit into a mini buffer and I can&#x27;t investigate why the error happens. I think that I use to click on the error in it was put into *Messages* buffer, but it doesn&#x27;t work like this now.
 Do you know what I have to do to see the type error in a buffer that doesn&#x27;t disappear like with a mini buffer?

                              <span>In my opinion all 3 of those have a natural right to sit on the TAB key:
  
Indentation: It is the tabulator key after all
 Completion: As in TAB-completion in the terminal
 folding: like in orgmode, but most code that has blocks can be folded
  
I don&#x27;t have a good solution for all of them at once. ideally it would support different packages for Indentation/compilation/folding. 
 What do you use?

 As we&#x27;ve reached the end of February(ish), it&#x27;s time for another TMiO post; this time from a non-emacs part of the Org ecosystem (gasp).

 Notice that the first hline (horizontal line) is slightly thicker than the others, because it is interpreting the first hline as a column header.

                              <span>Is there a way to rename links automatically based on the original headline?
 Example:
 * Headline 1 :PROPERTIES: :ID: some_id :END: * Headline 2 - Headline 1 // this is a link using an id * Headline 3 - Headline 1 // this is a link using an id 
 When creating a new internal link, org allows you to specify the text for that link. Is there a way to dynamically change that linking text based on the headline? If I change the text of Headline 1
 to Headline 4, I now want to be able to run a function that can change the text of all links to Headline 4
 Is that possible?
 ​
 I basically need to write a function that will:
 Loop over all internal links. For each link:
  
Get the text from the headline that is linked
 replace the text of the link

                              <span>Hi,
 I have an issue in the new Scala3 docs. Special characters in entities are not escaped when the scala doc is generated, which leads to some issue when hosting the scaladoc on some website like Github Pages. An example would be a class named &quot;~&quot; which generate a file called &quot;~.html&quot; which is not found by Github Pages
 However in previous Scala2 scaladoc the character was escaped with something like &quot;$tilde.html&quot;
 Any idea if it is possible to get this behavior in scala3 ? 
 Here are a working and a flawed example :

Thanks in advance :)

The next release of Emacs, Emacs 29, will come with built-in support for pixel-based scrolling.
 You can enable it using pixel-scroll-precision-mode. 
  
I hadn&#x27;t heard of this. Has anyone used this? Are there any performance issues? In my 5-minute testing I haven&#x27;t noticed any.
 EDIT: According to Emacs&#x27; etc/NEWS, this is what the new mode actually improves in comparison to pixel-scroll-mode:
  ** New minor mode &#x27;pixel-scroll-precision-mode&#x27;. When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse wheel reports. Unlike &#x27;pixel-scroll-mode&#x27;, this mode scrolls the display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line scrolls.

 I also created a repository to display information about people who are available as buddies: https://github.com/ag91/emacs-buddy
 Crossing fingers we are going to share Emacs magic with more people this way :D

 Currently on MacOS. Looking at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Tab-Bars.html
 Can&#x27;t seem to find anything to change the appearance of the buttons to make it look better.

                              <span>Hi there!
 Enrique here! The consult-project-extra package got recently accepted into MELPA. Nevertheless, expect to also find the package in GNU ELPA in the future, since it only requires packages either built into Emacs or on GNU ELPA (as is consult).
 Please, try the MELPA installation process, and test the functions out. I really appreciate any comments.
 Best,

 Motivation:
 I found the exwm built-in functionality for moving windows between workspaces pretty buggy. If I remember correctly, my major issue was that the built-in functionality only worked for windows displaying exwm buffers but I wanted all windows to be treated equally. I also threw in a completing-read interface that I though I would use but haven&#x27;t found much use for it. Instead I find the functionality to move windows to a specific workspace by number far more useful. 
 ​
 Anyways, feedback welcome. Happy to post to melpa if people find it useful.

 I found emacs-dashboard (dashboard.el) to be a bit to involved for my liking. I wanted a much more minmimalistic splash screen that achived the following goals:
  
Centered text (any arbitrary ascii banner) regardless of the current window size. 
 Used just a single buffer rather than requiring a bunch of duplicate buffers to achive requirement #1. 
 No flashy buttons or other things that I would never bother to click anyways. 
  
​
 Its probably not everyone&#x27;s taste but it does what I need it to. Perhaps others will find it useful. If people want I can put on melpa. 
 Feedback welcome.

                              <span>Following up on my last post about dired-registers, here is a package I recently took over maintenance of. I fixed a bug that was preventing copy and pasting of entire directories recursively. That said, main development was from Hidaka Uchida a number of years back. 
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-copy-paste
 ​
 This is just a really minimalistic (same theme as dired-registers) implementation of a copy-paste interface like Ranger or Ranger.el (just much more minimal). 
 ​
 See Readme on github for more details.

 If people find this useful I will post to melpa.

                              <span>Feedback appreciated. I am new to writing emacs packages for others. So far most of mine have just been written for my own use. If people find this useful, I will post to melpa. 
 ​
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-registers
 ​
 Motivation:
 I like emacs bookmarks but I rarely want to create something so permanent to just hold my place when moving between directories (e.g., when copying and pasting files between directories; see dired-copy-paste for more on copying and pasting in dired). This package lower the barrier to keeping your place by implementing registers storing a directory and making it easy to jump back later. Think of these registers like temporary bookmarks that don&#x27;t persist between sessions (just like evil registers).

 See the Readme for more details.

                              <span>If org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks is set to &#x27;invisible, then the asterisks for habits of certain headlines in the agenda display in a greyed-out face (dimmed), rather than the white face I&#x27;m used to. The headlines are those where, in the agenda display, the text of the headline does not reach the beginning of the habit graph. I discovered that lengthening the heading sufficiently (just adding more text) and rebuilding the agenda makes the asterisks white. Removing the extra text and rebuilding again greys them out again.
 I noticed this happening a couple of days ago. What is going? Is this meant to happen, and if not, what can I do about it?

                              <span>I want to start using dotfiles in a bare repo, and commit/pull using magit. I have found the following code to use magit with a bare repo:
 ;; prepare the arguments (setq dotfiles-git-dir (concat &quot;--git-dir&#x3D;&quot; (expand-file-name &quot;~/.dotfiles&quot;))) (setq dotfiles-work-tree (concat &quot;--work-tree&#x3D;&quot; (expand-file-name &quot;~&quot;))) ;; function to start magit on dotfiles (defun dotfiles-magit-status () (interactive) (add-to-list &#x27;magit-git-global-arguments dotfiles-git-dir) (add-to-list &#x27;magit-git-global-arguments dotfiles-work-tree) (call-interactively &#x27;magit-status)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;F5 d&quot;) &#x27;dotfiles-magit-status) ;; wrapper to remove additional args before starting magit (defun magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args () (interactive) (setq magit-git-global-arguments (remove dotfiles-git-dir magit-git-global-arguments)) (setq magit-git-global-arguments (remove dotfiles-work-tree magit-git-global-arguments)) (call-interactively &#x27;magit-status)) ;; redirect global magit hotkey to our wrapper (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args) (define-key magit-file-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args) 
 It works great, however, I would like to automatically add/remove the magit-git-global-arguments automatically depending on what directory magit is opened from: adding the bare repo config when in home, and removing it for all others.
 How can I add a hook that detects when magit is about to get launched, and checks the directory, to then either add or remove the flags?

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling to set the correct font size in Emacs. In Doom, CMD +/- increases/decreases the font size, but the font size is never the same as that of VSCode or iterm - it is either a bit too large or a bit too small. I&#x27;m setting the font size as:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Menlo&quot; :size 12) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;Monaco&quot;) ; inherits &#x60;doom-font&#x27;&#x27;s :size doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family &quot;Courier New&quot; :size 12) doom-big-font (font-spec :family &quot;monospace&quot; :size 19)) 
 Which is same setting as that of VSCode, but VSCode font size appears to be a bit smaller than Emacs (which I prefer). Any tips on how to make the font sizes same? I&#x27;m on Emacs 28.05 native on MacOS Monterey. Thanks in advance!

 It&#x27;s interesting that it has taken several years, or perhaps that it has taken me switching to mu4e as my email client (last few weeks), in addition to my GTD system which has been in org-mode for at least 2 years now.

 If I want to move the M-x &quot;popup&quot; to look more like the VSCode drop-down action menu, using Vanilla Emacs, how should I approach that? I&#x27;m using Counsel, if that makes a difference:
 ;; Replace default &quot;M-x&quot; and &quot;C-x C-f&quot; with Counsel version (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-x&quot;) #&#x27;counsel-M-x) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x C-f&quot;) #&#x27;counsel-find-file) 
 Sorry for the really dumb question :/
 My whole init.el if that helps, any constructive criticism welcome! https://gist.github.com/anthonyclarka2/d5e8005b8c5a10ce9ca8b0965f33554e

                              <span>I currently call lp from the terminal to print my pdfs. Is there a better way of doing this from emacs?
 As far as I understood, Emacs provides printing.el lpr.el, and ps-print.el to print text but not pdfs. I use pdf-tools which provides pdf-misc-print-document which I can use to print with lp by setting pdf-misc-print-program-executable and pdf-misc-print-program-args. However, I am looking for &quot;Print Dialog&quot; like package where I can select the (network) printer, the pages, the orientation and the double-sided vs not, etc... 
 I can write a lisp function to query for these, but I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

                              <span>Hello reddit, its me again.
 I have switched to lsp-pyright and everything is fine except Python documentation functionalities. I wondered if anyone has the same problem as me and I hope that someone can give me some pointers on how to fix this.
 The problem I have is that lsp-doc-show and company-show-doc-buffer return incomplete results for many builtins and many numpy functions. Envoking these commands on list for example returns
 class list() 
 and nothing more.
 I have tried quite a lot and I am pretty confident that it has to do with LSP itself or my LSP setup because anaconda-mode-show-doc yields
 builtins list() list(iterable: Iterable[_T]) Built-in mutable sequence. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list. The argument must be an iterable if specified. 
 which is what I want from LSP.
 Any ideas?

 I might want to define some keys for a purpose, but it&#x27;s also possible that some future package I install could overwrite my definition, right? [EDIT: Or one package clobbering another package.]

Great, I type i and it&#x27;s marked for installation. Then / / to get back to the main list. But now, beeminder is no longer marked for installation.
 I should think that / / should only affect my view, and not remove the I install designation. Am I wrong?

                              <span>Hi,
 Would anyone have some recommendation for learning how to programmatically manipulate org-mode with elisp? 
 I don&#x27;t have much elisp knowledge but all the other 3rd party libraries I have found are read-only and could not find anything that allow manipulation of the file itself. 
 I have digged into the source of org-element api but I am left rather confused than anything. 
 I am trying to build an integration with gitlab and orgmode (full project description here) and while I wanted to go with either python or go, I haven&#x27;t found an easy way to modify org files with any of these libraries... 
 So I am trying to go with elisp, which would probably be the most native way to do it, I am just not sure where to start...
 any direction is welcome!

                              <span>This time, without question, I removed all doubt about my connection with reality. I&#x27;ve stuttered and stammered and forgotten the common names of things stumbling along for 20 mins. Confused zettel, note, and file and a PC and a MAC,  and mentioning sideways carrots?( what the hell are those) over and over again. I&#x27;m not getting any better at making videos. Watch this at your own risk. I can&#x27;t be responsible for damages to your DNA? You might get something out of this video that will help your writing.
This combo of the software The Archive and Marked2 are the absolute best writing software combo ever!
A part of the writing process that this video doesn&#x27;t show is the gathering and referencing of the entire ZK when making the zettel that makes up this essay. I habitually run The Archive in two-window mode and keep the right window focused on my work and the left window I use to search my ZK, view PDFs or live preview with Marked2.

Best view in full screen.

The two-window workflow allows you to write and research effectively. It is so efficient that it is fun. The most fun you can have writing!
Try this - for the win!

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a longer piece critiquing the mechanistic view of folgezettel.
&quot;Folgezettel is More than Mechanism&quot;
This article intends to:
Show that the current state of the FZ debate is one mired in a mechanistic reading of folgezettel
Add to the discussion the often overlooked experiential aspects of employing folgezettel
Show how the practice of folgezettel positively influences the note making process
Diversify and broaden the discussion in an effort to show that zettelkasten techniques are more compliments than competitors
From the article:

  
&quot;A mechanistic view is one that privileges the mechanics of a process over the experiential. It ignores the emotional. It tries to establish cohesion often through reductive arguments, determining value (more or less of it) by how parts function together as a system divorced from the subjective experience of the user. As it stands, the folgezettel debate is mired in this mechanistic systems thinking....&quot;</span>

                              <span>@GeoEng51 + @sfast were discussing Markdown editors in another thread and also mentioned Monodraw (which is what I use for my visual structure notes). This might be rehashing an old topic, but I am still curious:
What are your favorite tools adjacent to your Zettelkasten?
by &quot;adjacent&quot; I mean &quot;not your ZK but integral to your knowledge ecosystem&quot;
Broadly, I see three categories for these:
I&#x27;m mostly interested in 3, but any solid arguments for specific ways of handling 1 or 2 to work well with a ZK is welcome. For such arguments for example, why should I download Typora instead of writing in a more general editor like Atom?</span>

                              <span>Hi, I have this function which solves this problem: https://purdue.kattis.com/problems/trainsorting. solve is the naive recursive version and solve&#x27; is the DP version. I used the method shown on the Haskell wiki to construct the DP matrix. 
 The algorithm works, but its runtime scales with the bounds of the matrix, so it takes a prohibitively long time with bounds higher than 1000 or so. I don&#x27;t understand why though, since I can tell by the trace that it only calculates the required elements. My first thought is that it has to preallocate the array, but I tried it with a Data.Map as well for the same result.
 Any explanation is appreciated

                              <span>Using Haskell has made me think about imperative languages differently. An interesting thing to think about is that the “async/await” patterns of these languages mirror monad patterns in Haskell with do-notation. The “await” keyword with “var x &#x3D; await …” is just like “x &lt;- …” in Haskell. And Future is really just a monadic type! Perhaps one day we’ll see an imperative language implement true monads and do asynchrony in terms of them.

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So... I have a doubt related to the usage of for comprehension...
 Lets imagine that I have an User type that is the product of UserId, UserName and UserEmail and each of them contains its own validations, right?
 So lets imagine that my value called UserName looks like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala final case class ValidationError(message: String)
 final case class UserName private(name: String)
 type UserNameFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[ValidationError, UserName]
 object UserName { def fromString(rawName: String): UserNameFactoryResult &#x3D; ... // some validation blabla } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now I am trying to think about the factory for the User entity inside of my object companion.
 I want to use somekind of for-comprehension but I dont have any idea on how to mix the for-comprehension with my either results
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class User(id: UserId, name: UserName, email: UserEmail)
 type UserFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[List[ValidationError], User]
 object User { def createFromStrings(rawId: String, rawName: String, rawEmail: String): UserFactoryResult &#x3D; { val eitherUser &#x3D; for { id &lt;- UserId.fromString(rawId) // this can be Left or Right name &lt;- UserName.fromString(rawName) // this can be Left or Right email &lt;- UserEmail.fromString(rawEmail) // this can be Left or Right } yield new Right(User(id, name, email)) } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 well well... what I need to do with this code is to find a way to CORRECTLY returns EITHER a List with each error that happened in those type values EITHER my valid User with its correct values.
 what should I do? what is the cleanest way of doing this with pure scala 3? can I avoid nesting pattern match inside this for-comprehension? how to go on with this?

                              <span>Hello guys! I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.
 First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.
 I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.
 I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).
 For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. 
 Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed
 Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky
 Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I&#x27;ve found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.
 Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. 
 If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.
 What I need:
  
apps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow 
  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps
  
Something like this:
 apps/
 ├─ app-1/
 ├─ app-2/
 ├─ app-3/
 libs/
 ├─ feature-1/
 ├─ feature-3/
 ├─ feature-4/
 ├─ feature-2/
 ​
 How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?
 As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.
 Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?
 Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?
 Thank you for your answers!

 In particular, I&#x27;m looking for Scala 3 compatible ORM/RDBMS libraries, and JSON libraries that include macros for deriving codecs. Up until now I&#x27;ve been hand writing codecs for small scale Scala 3 projects and using Java based ORMs, but I feel it&#x27;s been long enough to give native libraries another look.

                              <span>I am experimenting with Doom Emacs but it feel like performance is at least as bad as it was with my hand-rolled config. I am running 28.0.91 with native comp on Mojave.
 The stated startup time on the splash screen is normally 2-3 seconds: &quot;Doom loaded 208 packages across 34 modules in 2.06 seconds&quot;. Restoring my previous workspace with 20-30 buffers takes 7-8 seconds. Opening a file in a project takes 1-2 seconds. At first I thought it was due to LSP mode, but it&#x27;s still slow even with it disabled.
 I have followed some of the recommendations in Doom&#x27;s README &quot;why is Doom slow?&quot;, but my situation seems a bit more pathological than what those try to address. 
 I tried profiling opening a single line file (took a second or two) and the CPU profile says that it spent 28% of its time in automatic GC and 51% of its time in vertico--advice. I&#x27;m assuming that was the file selection popup, so it appears that Emacs is really just spending all its time waiting for something. I&#x27;d be grateful for advice how to debug further.

                              <span>Hi
 I&#x27;m looking to enhance my writing experience by dragging text around.
 In Org-mode, dragging the current paragraph (or subtree, or list item) up and down is easy with M-up and M-down.
 I&#x27;m an Evil user, so for swapping two regions, there&#x27;s evil-exchange.
 Is there a package that would allow me to drag the current region up or down? Or perhaps right or left, along the same line? Or does anyone have any pointers on how to best write something that achieves this?
 Cheers

 I imagine, if this is even possible, I would need to bind my own key chord to a which-key command, something like this:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-M-\&#x60;&quot;) #&#x27;which-key-show-top-level) 
 But that only shows the top level commands (for the current major mode?). Or perhaps there&#x27;s another package that does this?

                              <span>tl;dr: Org-capture window closes in i3wm for no reason, how to debug or identify the problem?
 Hi! A beginner user, I use emacs-client 26.3 and Emacs 27.2 with org-capture on Ubuntu 20.4 running i3wm. (Could version mismatch be the problem?) I append text of an org-capture template to an org file. I probably misconfigured something and have these problems:
  
Launching a new window of org-capture from i3wm (triggered by a keystroke) works, but the window closes unexpectedly after some 10-50 seconds, often before I finish writing a note in the template and the work is lost. But if I type fast enough and complete C-c C-c before crash then all is good. What would be the log file I should look into? What could cause this?
  
In my I3wm I have the following command to open the org-capture windo…</span>

 As the question asks, where is the variable global-map initially filled with values ? It is defined in subr.el as nil and many keys are defined in bindings.el. However, I seem to miss something because I can&#x27;t for instance find where letters are bound to self-insert-command.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi, all. Some of you might&#x27;ve seen my last post on Vertico, Marginalia, All-the-icons-completion, and Orderless last week.
 I present to you my small configuration for Corfu, Kind-icon, and Corfu-doc, which greatly complement the packages in that previous post by enhancing the built-in completion-at-point.
 Sometime in the near future, I&#x27;ll be trying to show my (messy) way of utilizing the cape package&#x27;s completion-at-point backends.
 Cheers!

                              <span>I have an intermediate level knowledge of bash scripting and use of the linux command line.I know given enough time i could eventually become a power user but my dilemma is this: im also falling deeper in love with emacs. The more i read about it the more i get the feeling that it would be much more time-efficient to just master emacs and forego going deeper down the rabbit holes of bash shell scripting and the various Gnu utilities and .etc. It seems to me that with emacs I pretty much get a entire environment in which all packages,commands,config files and etc are all written in one language(e lisp). So that being said, can I just go &quot;all in&quot; on learning emacs and e lisp and just more or less ignore bash scripting and learning more about the various linux terminal commands?

 I&#x27;ve tried reinstalling/updating GHC and HLS but the issue remains. I couldn&#x27;t find any information about this issue and was hoping someone else could assist.
 GHC version - 8.10.7
 HLS version - 1.6.1.0

 What is your current favorite package for using free monads (either directly or in the spirit of) to implement EDSLs?

                              <span>Hello all! I&#x27;m currently implementing a source code formatter using prettyprinter and ran into a situation that I can&#x27;t get over.
 The assembly of the Doc is performed in the context of a state Monad, as I need to keep track of some state as I go on:
  type StateDoc &#x3D; State MyState (Doc ()) 
 This works fine, I have individual functions that assemble different parts of the document:
  fortmatPartA :: DataA -&gt; StateDoc fortmatPartB :: DataB -&gt; StateDoc fortmatPartC :: DataC -&gt; StateDoc  It the end when I put the document together, parts A, B and C are to be arranged on top of each other vertically:
 vsep  sequence [formatPartA dataA, formatPartB dataB, formatPartC dataC]
 Now the problem that I&#x27;m having is that formatPartB and formatPartC can return an emptyDoc, which can result in something like [PartADoc, emptyDoc, PartBDoc]. This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns emptyDoc.
 Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?
 I thought about not using emptyDoc at all, but Maybe instead:
 formatPartB :: DataB -&gt; State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))
 but how could I implement the &quot;excluding&quot; logic that ignores the Nothings? Is there something like a mapMaybe or catMaybe for Monads? Maybe I&#x27;m missing something obvious.
 Thanks a lot for your help and happy haskelling :)

                              <span>The PureScript team has launched the language&#x27;s first annual survey! This survey will help the core team learn more from the community about how we can improve the language and the ecosystem around it. If you&#x27;ve used PureScript before, please take the time to fill out this survey:
 https://surveyhero.com/c/wzajwjpd
 Even if you have never written PureScript, we want to hear from you! There&#x27;s a short section specifically for non-users.
 If you can share this survey with your peers and communities that would also be super helpful.
 Thanks for your time and we look forward to hearing your thoughts!

                              <span>I&#x27;m literally 10 minutes into my adventures with PureScript, so I know almost nothing and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some very obvious things! But I&#x27;m working through the book at https://book.purescript.org/ and am wondering why the code and tests all produce a bunch of warnings?
 For example, one warning I see for the Chapter 2 code is:
  
No type declaration was provided for the top-level declaration of ns
  
I&#x27;m working in VSCode and have v0.14.7 of purs (and generally the latest versions of everything as far as I know). Maybe the book would prefer me to use an older version of the compiler?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am working on a software project which I am organizing my tasks in a hierarchical structure where a top level heading is a general feature and the sub headings are tasks that need to be done concerning that feature.
 This is very simple so far, what I would like to add now is a milestone tag so I can associate some features with a specific version, this is a very common approach in software development as far as I know. The problem is that when I write a tag containing dots, org-mode considers the dots as tag separators, so I cannot write a tag as the following :v1.0: because it would be replaced with :v1:0:.
 If anyone has any workaround for this let me know. Or if you have any other suggestions I would like to give them a try, I myself thought about some alternatives but I would first want to know if I can do it the way I want.

If I then check the value of the variable with describe-variable (it _does_ includehabits) and refresh the agenda, the habit graphs show up! Similarly if I open emacs, check the variable, (again,habits&#x60; is present in the list) and then open the agenda the graphs display, but if I don&#x27;t check the variable they don&#x27;t.
 Am I doing something wrong or is this a report-worthy bug?

                              <span>I know any such statistics would be rough, just wondering if there&#x27;s a way to see something like this.
  
EDIT: Answered by /u/yyoncho: &quot;You can sort by downloads on melpa.org&quot;. So here&#x27;s an example of how I&#x27;m using it. As an emacs newbie, I&#x27;m interested in installing some package, let&#x27;s say ido mode, but I&#x27;m also interested in the dozen or so related packages (containing &quot;ido-&quot;). But it&#x27;s hard to get a sense of their popularity, age, etc. 
 So I downloaded the list of all packages from melpa.org, sorted by download count, and made it into a tab-delimited file: Here&#x27;s the gist link to my text file.. Then I grep that to get only the &quot;ido-&quot; packages:
 Download count Name Description Release Repository &quot;482,602&quot; smex M-x interface with Ido-style fuzzy matching. 20151212.2209 github &quot;290,389&quot; …</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t2sy6e/newbie_csret_seems_counterintuitive_in_this_case/">

                              <span>Given this structure (Example 1), if point is anywhere in the line Proj1 (Level 1) and I hit C-S-RET, it will create a new &quot;Level 1&quot; TODO heading just before Proj2 (Level 1)
  
Example 1
 * Proj1 (Level 1) &lt;-- IF POINT IS ANYWHERE HERE * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * Proj2 (Level 1) &lt;-- C-S-RET INSERTS &quot;* TODO&quot; JUST BEFORE HERE AT LEVEL 1 * Proj2 H1 (Level 2) 
 
 But if they are folded and point is after ellipses:
  
Example 2
 * PROJ1...x &lt;-- point at space marked x * Proj2... 
 
 When I hit C-S-RET I get this:
  
Example 3 
 * PROJ1... * TODO * Proj2... 
 
 That TODO has two invisible parents, which obscures it&#x27;s context, which is shown unfolded here:
  
Example 4 
 * Proj1 (Level 1) * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * TODO (Level 4) &lt;-- TODO ADDED HERE * Proj2 (Level 1) 
 
 Why does C-S-RET add a TODO exactly 3 levels deeper in this case? Why not any of the following alternatives: 
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
 At level 5 (depth first traversal of tree)
  
What is &quot;magical&quot; about 3 levels deeper? What are some ways for a typical beginner to deal with this? Maybe &quot;never use C-S-RET after ellipses&quot;? I certainly don&#x27;t want to memorize that rule. Or is there some control variable?
 I think that a sane default would be one of the following:
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
  
Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!

 The one issue I&#x27;m running into is that if I mark messages in my inbox with &quot;refile&quot; (&quot;r&quot; in evil mode) and then execute the command, it appears that the command executed correctly. However, when I then jump to my Archive folder, I don&#x27;t see any of the emails.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done so far to troubleshoot. If I manually look for the messages in a terminal by going into my mu maildir, I can see the archived messages. Additionally if I run &#x60;mu find some-message&#x60; I can see emails in the Archive directory. If I send my self a new email and then archive it, I can see it in emacs. But then if I update, it dissappears, so it looks like I can only see unread emails. Has a…</span>

                              <span>After some experimentation, I have finished a new Emacs feature for personal use that teaches Emacs&#x27; project and eglot packages how to understand a CMake project structure. It facilitates the following tasks:
  
Informing clangd about the project sources for better finding include files
 Finding compilation toolkits for MSYS2 (Windows) and Unix variants (in progress)
 Configuration of the project via cmake
 Building (compiling) the project with highlighting of errors
 Installing
 Unit testing with ctest
  
As usual, this is provided with no guarantees. It seems to be working on my Windows machine (with native Emacs, no WSL), but your mileage may vary. Feedback and pull requests welcome. Also help in integrating MSVC compilers and other toolkits.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve published a new package to MELPA called org-visibility. It persists your visibility state (i.e. which sections are visibly cycled on and off) of your org file buffers and restores that state when you next load them. I&#x27;ve been using a non-package version of this for years and thought it was time to put it into a proper package and share it.

 Hello fellow emacsians. I am in the very happy position to announce to you, my first ever contribution to emacs (besides helping people with emacs here and in other forums), in the form of a new package for emacs called zetteldesk.el. It is by no means done, I have things I want to add, and I am certain its also not perfect, but its usable, and to an extent polished so I thought I would release it. I am just an engineer who loves to take his notes with org-roam, so forgive me if some code isn&#x27;t written in the best version.
 ​
 The name zetteldesk derives from a mix of the words zettelkasten and desktop. I shortened it because zettelkasten-desktop was too large. zetteldesk.el is a tool I made, built primarily on top of org-roam - b…</span>

                              <span>My needs are just to write or edit simple code in C++, Python and Rust; And to maintain a lot of markdown, xml and text files. 
 Trying to find the &quot;best&quot; ide and corresponding plugins for each programming language was just annoying to me. For eg. IntelliJ IDEA is great for Rust, but doesn&#x27;t have an easy C++ support. 
 Thus my decision to switch to something like emacs or vim, which would have all-round support. 
 I completed the tutorial and immediately felt how convenient it would be to navigate around without having to take your hands off the keyboard. 
 I want to now continue to set up Emacs so that I can conveniently use it for the above needs. I&#x27;m setting it up in Manjaro Linux. 
 Do you all have any tips?

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 Im a converting a Try to Either but IDK how to pass my own Type Alias so I can compile.
 Example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala
 type UserIdFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[ValidationError, UserId]
 object UserId { private def apply(id: String): UserId &#x3D; new UserId(id) ... def fromString(rawId: String): UserIdFactoryResult &#x3D; { ... case Some(rawId) &#x3D;&gt; { // I need to return UserIdFactoryResult here Try(UUID.fromString(rawId)) .transform( success &#x3D;&gt; Success(Right(this.apply(success.toString))), error &#x3D;&gt; Success(Left(error)) ).get .... } } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But the problem is that this transformation returns an Either[Throwable, UserId] instead of UserIdFactoryResult...
 What should I do?

I&#x27;m trying out a new date format for the title of this thread. Let me know what you think. Are we starting this tread on a bad day? Maybe starting on Monday or Thursday would make more sense?
Please share what small or large ZK successes you had in the past week. Please share your plans are for this coming week. Use this as a public responsibility thread. Use it to hold yourself accountable. Use this as a way to start a conversation.

Last Week
Impermanence is all around me. Everything I see is a temporary arrangement of atoms soon dispersed and reassembled into new arrangements. My attention is also always temporary. Attention flitters from one object to another in a time frame that speeds up and slows just a little from the moment of awakening to after fully sleeping. Even then, dreams grab my attention.
I successfully integrated The Archive/Marked2/Zotero/Pandoc toolchain into my writing environment.

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;ve lurked around here on and off for a few years, and Zettelkasten was always in my head somewhere as a &#x27;will do that someday&#x27;. Well more and more I find myself knowing-but-not-quite some fact or info, or knowing that I know it, but not the full details that I knew at one point, or references or sources for looking it up.
So I decided to take the plunge and implement a zettelkasten system for myself. But as I investigated it I became intrigued by the simple yet powerful idea of notes and links, and decided to try to distill (my interpretation of) its essence into a new app. Yes, the cliche of the software dev who discovers zettelkasten and makes an app. However, I think mine has some advantages. For one thing I&#x27;m intentionally keeping it quite spartan–no endless customizability…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m brand new to Haskell. I&#x27;m not asking for you to do my assignment but I do need help figuring out how to use the language so I can complete my assignment. I might be going about this the absolute wrong way but I&#x27;ve never used a language like this before and I&#x27;m getting very lost. 
 Assignment:
 Write a Haskell program that generates the list of all the subsets of the set [1..n] that have as many elements as their complements.
 For the set [1,2,3,4] the output should look like this:
 [([1,2],[3,4]),
 ([1,3],[2,4]),
 ([1,4],[2,3]),
 ....] 
 I&#x27;m currently creating a list from 1-n where n is 6.
 I&#x27;m retrieving all of the subsequences of that list.
 let n &#x3D; 6 let set &#x3D; [1..n] let ordered &#x3D; sortWith length $ subsequences set 
 I don&#x27;t understand how to only get the list of the length of 3 out of this list of lists. What would be the best way to get the list of that length? Thank you for any input! I believe I can figure out the compliment on my own. I just don&#x27;t know how to get the certain lists I need.

                              <span>Suppose I start with this, with point on letter J:
  
Example 1
 * PROJECTS... * Inbox... 
 
 I want this
  
EXAMPLE 2 [EDIT: Actually, this is impossible with org-indent-mode on.]
 * PROJECTS... x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 What&#x27;s the standard way and/or the most efficient way to get there? Or alternatively, achieve this:
  
Example 3
 * PROJECTS... * x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 I know that if I start with Example 1 and I press C-S-RET, I&#x27;ll get this:
  
Example 4
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 That&#x27;s good enough for TODO&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to do something similar for the other cases. But it&#x27;s odd that it leaves a space there (why does it do that?). I&#x27;d rather it not, but I&#x27;ll accept this standard behavior, for now, if that&#x27;s just the way it works out-of-the-box. (I know I can change emacs to do whatever I want though.) Also, the C-S-RET behaves a little different if the point starts at the end of * Projects...x at space marked x. In that case, it creates something like this:
  
Example 5
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 In Example 5, it creates a new TODO item under the last child entry of * PROJECTS, but leaving * PROJECTS otherwise folded. Isn&#x27;t it a little odd to have an intermediate parent invisible? 
 Finally, does that last point position (marked x here:* Projects...x) have special meaning/purpose? Is there a name for that position?
 EDIT: I think some of my questions about the functionality of ellipses and spaces is probably related to this timely post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t1r2wq/have_you_ever_wondered_how_orgmode_toggles_the/. Which, from a newbie perspective, is probably summed up as &quot;Because reasons.&quot;

 This mode gives the ability to execute the just recipies from within the editor itself.

 I have swtiched to using straight.el because org-mode was complaining about switching repos and I really enjoy the flexibility if offers in selecting pacakages from sources such as Github. Recently, however, I have noticed that when I load any file .org file I get the following message:
  File mode specification error: (error Autoloading file /home/thomas/.emacs.d/straight/build/org/org.elc failed to define function org) 
 This error occurs every time an org file is loaded. I have found I can suppress the error by simply commenting out the line (org-agenda-files &#x60;(&quot;~/Dropbox/gtd&quot;)) in my init.el file.
 This works well, however, my favorite feature of org-mode is the agenda and this essentially breaks that feature. I cannot for the life of me fi…</span>

 The first idea was to get the remainder of the window-width divided by the current line length,
 (- (window-width) (% (length (thing-at-point &#x27;line)) (window-width))) 
 It just doesn&#x27;t work, cause line break happened between spaces.
 The second idea is simulate line break logic, i tried to sum length:

                              <span>Hi, some buffers can be deleted/hiddden using &quot;q&quot;, like help buffers etc (they probably have a name).
 xwidget seems to disapear (but its only hidden) and when its hidden it always shows another buffer instead. How can I configure this to actually quit the buffer and delete the window?
 This is my function for splitting and showing the browser on the right.
 (defun mk/browser-split-window (url &amp;optional new-window) &quot;Create a new browser window to the right of the current one.&quot; (interactive) (let* ((ignore-window-parameters t) (dedicated-p (window-dedicated-p))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-horizontally) (other-window 1) (xwidget-webkit-browse-url url))) 
 Looks nice - now lets close it using \&quot;q\&quot;
 Hmm not really what I wanted.
 My complete config can be found here: https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs
 And as a bonus I have another question:
 How do I setup emacs to always set focus to (other-window 1) when a new window is created?
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I was playing around with diff-buffers and ediff-buffers. I had no idea what I was doing, and I ended up with my primary notes.org file containing highlighted sections, saved to disk. I didn&#x27;t know how to get rid of this formatting, so I restored it from the backup notes.org~, as I had only made a minor change (thank goodness). Here&#x27;s the two files, the original (restored), and the ediff highlighted file:
 https://i.imgur.com/K7340jK.png
 Now my questions are as follows:
  
I thought org files were visible text only files, editable in any other text editor. But it&#x27;s clearly saving the highlight features with the text. How is it doing that? What is the format?
 
If I end up with something like this on the right again, how can I strip all the highlight formatting, so I get back to what&#x27;s shown on the left?

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how org-mode toggles the visibility of headings?
 YES!!! me either!
 Let&#x27;s get into it ;)
 Table of content:
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 text properties
 Why are we talking about text properties if the mechanism of outline-mode uses overlays?
 overlays, invisible overlay property, buffer-invisibility-spec 
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to t
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to nil
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo) t)
 
 ellipsis and buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo . t) t) 
 default ellipsis ...
 custom ellipsis modifying the display table
 
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 org-mode is built on top of outline-mode that is responsible of the visibility changes of the headings.
 How does it work?
 outline-mode uses overlays, specifically the o…</span>

                              <span>I saved an elisp cheat sheet (https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp_Cheat_Sheet), which helped me a lot when I want to write some elisp code after my memory with the APIs blurred. It organizes the APIs into categories nicely, so I can quickly find out the exact APIs that I want, and then I look up them inside Emacs using Help, Info, etc.
 But the page was gone last year (I can&#x27;t remember the exact date), the content was gone, although the URL was still reachable. What a pity!
 Do you know why it was gone? I didn&#x27;t find an alternative to it after that. If you know the maintainer or maintainers, would you like to tell him/her/them about the issue? Thanks!
 If you were also like me, the good news is that we can visit its backup on Wayback Machine, https://web.archive.org/web/20201202092534/https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp_Cheat_Sheet, thanks to the Internet Archive!

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>So I&#x27;ve used Monoids in the fp-ts TypeScript library, which is where I learned most of my FP skills. I&#x27;m now diving into Scala and looking to re-use all the constructs I learned over there.
 Anyway, I installed Scalaz and now I&#x27;ve got a list to concatenate into a single value. Sounds easy enough, let&#x27;s just use a Monoid.
 Based on fp-ts, I was expecting the append() function of the Monoid to have a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: String): String 
 When, as you already know, it actually has a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: &#x3D;&gt; String): String 
 I&#x27;m not even sure what the type of the second argument is supposed to be, let alone how to use this to concatenate my list into a single value.
 Help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I&#x27;ve been using it myself for a bit, and I felt it reached the stage where it&#x27;s as ready for public consumption as it&#x27;ll ever be. I&#x27;d be interested to know if there are other interested in data visualisation out of scala code... It&#x27;s young, and follows a different paradigm to some of the Prior Art. Feedback, observations and interest welcomed.

 type Equivalence[A] &#x3D; A &#x3D;&gt; A &#x3D;&gt; Boolean 
 But I don&#x27;t understand which type of functor will fit such type here. Briefly, Equivalence looks like a contravariant function with a negative position in input, but in practice, I cannot assemble contravariant functor:
  val coFunctorForEq &#x3D; new ContravariantFunctor[Equivalence] { override def contraMap[A, B](fa: Equivalence[A])(f: B &#x3D;&gt; A): Equivalence[B] &#x3D; (b: B) &#x3D;&gt; b &#x3D;&gt; fa(f(b))(???) } 
 Do I understand correct, that I need invariant functor here?

I just upgraded to The Archive 1.7.6 (202) and noticed that we can now &quot;drag and drop&quot; images into a zettle.  The image will automatically be copied to the media sub-folder within your ZK folder, the reference will be inserted into your zettel, and the image will appear - presto!
That is so much easier than copying the image to your media file and then typing the reference in your zettel.
Thank you so much for this timesaver!!!  It is such a cool feature    (Sometimes little things make a big difference)</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for writing articles for a while. And I recently tried RMarkdown. I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. 
 I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. 
 I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;decline&quot;. Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? 
 Anyway, maybe too much information here. Just curious to see others&#x27; experience of using org-mode for academic writing.

                              <span>At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.
 The &quot;role&quot; of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of &quot;equality functor&quot; the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor&#x27;s parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:
  
definitional equality, nominal role
 representational equivalence, representational role
 codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role
  
So it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -&gt; in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:
  
haskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-&gt; Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int 
 haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-&gt; Type data Representation x &#x3D; Representational x 
 haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-&gt; Type data Phantom x &#x3D; Phantom 
  
Similar systems of inference, notation, &quot;subtyping&quot; etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of &quot;role polymorphism&quot;, although I personally haven&#x27;t given this much thought.
 What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?
 EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a PoC literately programmed python project and cannot for the life of me figure out how to have LSP-based completion inside noweb blocks. There is a sort of pseudocode block with a few references to chunks that come later, and I would like to have completion while writing these chunks somehow. Editing the :noweb yes chunk of code using C-c &#x27; does not seem to expand the noweb references at all, which is not ideal. The blocks themselves also don&#x27;t have completion when I tangle the :noweb yes block to a file and use lsp-org.
 Both of those solutions feel like they should work, so it is possible I&#x27;ve run into a bug because I&#x27;m running gccemacs. Is this the case? Is it normal for noweb and lsp-based completion for python to just work inside of your org file?
 I&#x27;m very much hoping I&#x27;m just doing something wrong, as the potential of this style when writing code for high-turnover teams with mixed capabilities seems very high to me. I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be possible to instigate such a culture change without code completion.

                              <span>Hej Hej,
 This [https://gitlab.com/OlMon/consult-flyspell] is a small package to collect all misspelled words in a buffer and display it with consult.
 This package was born because I wanted to have a nice display of all my mistakes. I know kinda sadistic...
 I tried the great package flycheck-aspell/flymake-aspell [https://github.com/leotaku/flycheck-aspell]. It has almost everything I need, but for my 11 year old notebook it was a little bit to much. Additionally I was not sure if I would only use aspell and not switch to hunspell at some day.
 In the consult issue &quot;command wishlist&quot; it is stated:
 &quot;consult-flyspell, provided by see https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct, [...]&quot;
 That is correct, flyspell-correct displays the correction in the minibuffer, consult-flyspell displays the misspelled words in the minibuffer.
 I actually use both packages and set the variable consult-flyspell-correct-function to flyspell-correct-at-point to jump to a word and correct it.
 Maybe it helps someone, or maybe I did something that already existed, then please let me know.
 Cheers,
 OlMon

When writing my own functions, I&#x27;ve been doing two message calls, but sometimes those messages will appear one after the other even if nothing has appeared between them.
 Is there a function, macro, or some other pattern to keep in mind to copy the behavior with several built-in Emacs functions? Or is it some built-in magic that I&#x27;m not going to really be privvy to?

                              <span>is there a package that enables minibuffer completion for ivy, something like zsh history navigation? 
 for example i have a history entry that contains: defun and it is buried somewhere in minibuffer history, so when i type for example def and navigate the history, all history entries that begin with def should be the one to be navigated

 Would there happen to be any utilities to execute entire org-mode files, similar to bashup&#x27;s mdsh? This allows users to execute markdown files via bash. I&#x27;d like to combine it with a nix-shell shebang!
 Thank you kindly for the help!

 When I try C-x C-f /ssh:student@, Emacs just ether hangs or creates a new file with that name. While normal ssh CLI was doing just fine.

                              <span>At some point in I think 2021, read-extended-command-predicate was added, which lets you filter what M-x shows you. One of the intended use cases is to prevent commands for one major mode from showing up when working in another major mode. It&#x27;s nil by default, but you can (setq read-extended-command-predicate &#x27;command-completion-default-include-p)... except for the fact that basically no package I can find actually uses this, either by using
 (defun foo () (declare (modes . (lisp-mode))) (interactive) (message &quot;I only show up in some-mode&quot;)) 
 or by (put &#x27;foo &#x27;command-modes &#x27;(lisp-mode)). I&#x27;d like to go through all the commands whose names start with (say) python- and mark them as being python-mode commands. What&#x27;s the easiest way to do that?
 PS, is there any downside to package authors doing this? The declare variation warns on older versions of emacs, but the put variation should work no matter what. I&#x27;m really surprised this has almost no adoption/conversation that I could find. Out of all the packages I have cloned locally, only transient uses it, and only vertico and other packages by the same author use the related completion-predicate property.

                              <span>Hello. In a normal org source block for LaTex, I can view the source with org-edit-src-code. So the org headers are #+begin_src latex and #+end_src
 This will open a new window where my autocomplete package, in this case yassnippet, can autocomplete base on key words. For example, while inside the editting source code mode, I can type &quot;eq&quot; and TAB and automatically a LaTex snippet for equation is inserted. 
 For my case, sometimes I need to use an export block, so #+begin_export latex and #+end_export. How can I autocomplete in this case? Obviously, org-edit-src-code does not work because it is not an &quot;src&quot; block but an &quot;export&quot; block. 
 Any input is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to use the dabbrev for every file where connected to our git project.
 I wrote it to use every buffer (just for testing):
 (defun my/dabbrev-select-buffer (other-buffer)
  &#x60;(eq 1 1))&#x60; &#x60;(setq dabbrev-friend-buffer-function #&#x27;my/dabbrev-select-buffer)&#x60; 
 But it isn&#x27;t working.
 How can I set it up well ?

                              <span>Some time ago I created a very simple sbt plugin to generate arbitrary configuration files. It&#x27;s pretty much a copy of sbt-github-actions. The only difference is that it is not limited to GitHub Actions configurations, but can generate all kinds of text files. The key feature is that the plugin is able to verify that the generated configs are up-to-date in CI (just like sbt-github-actions).
 Since I&#x27;ve noticed how incredibly useful this plugin has become for me, I thought I&#x27;d share it here to show it to a wider audience (:
 I tend to use it for deployment configs, generating dev environment Dockerfiles and unopinionated GitHub Actions configs.

                              <span>I use the logging functionality of todo state changes with todo keywords like
 +todo: [☛]TODO(t) [&gt;]Started(s!) [☀]Current(c) | [✔]DONE(d!) +todo: [⚑]WAITING(w!) | +todo: | [✘]CANCELED(x!) 
 However, I would like the time stamps being generated to be less verbose. Currently they are something like: - State &quot;[⚑]WAITING&quot; from &quot;[☛]TODO&quot; [2022-02-24 Thu 10:10]. However I don&#x27;t really care about the time part of it. I&#x27;d just like something with the year, month, and day like: - State &quot;[⚑]WAITING&quot; from &quot;[☛]TODO&quot; [2022-02-24 Thu]. Is this something that is configurable?

 I plan to organise an online meeting aiming to hunt performance issues with latest Org mode. If you are ready to share screen and do interactive debugging, feel free to join. I will post a jisti link in Org mode ML [1] 1 hour before the meeting.

                              <span>I have an org-mode file that I would like to publish some documentation with. I include code samples. When I execute those code samples I get the output rendered into the .org file. Ex

If you are using emacs, execute the code-block(s) when it makes sense to you. You can use this document to set up a running AI robot dog on your /Computer/. #+END_QUOTE 
 I use spacemacs and perform an export with SPC e e H h (running Export to Hugo-compatible Markdown, file to Md file). This creates a file hugo/content/posts/README.md like I expect.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;shell cat LIKENESS.txt &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &gt; You can execute this previous code-block and, other code-blocks by pressing &#x60;Ctrl-C Ctrl-C&#x60; in a properly configured emacs&#x27; org-mode. &gt; &gt; If you are using emacs, execute the code-block(s) when it makes sense to you. &gt; &gt; You can use this document to set up a running AI robot dog on your _Computer_. 
 Infuriatingly, the actual RESULTS don&#x27;t make it into the final output. How can I get the #+RESULTS: rendered into a

                              <span>Out of the box, calling org-store-link when point is on a headline displayed on an agenda view behaves as you would expect: it does much what it would have done had you called org-store-link from an org-mode buffer visiting the relevant file with point on the same headline. But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:
 user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer 
 After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).
 Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.
 Any ideas?

 I know there is the whitespace-cleanup-mode which does a okay job with the option to only do cleanup when the file was already clean, but i would like to go further and only do whitespace cleanup on the lines i have modified.
 anyone would know how to replicate this feature?

 One my of emacs windows is showing that file, however, if I update the image again the image on the buffer will only update if I select the buffer. How to make it update itself?

                              <span>When trying to open, from dired, a file in a deep subdirectory, I get an error like:
 after-find-file: Getting attributes: File name too long, /home/xxxxxx/xxx/emacs-auto-save/#!home!xxxxxx!xxxxxx!xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx!xxxxxxxx!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx!xx.x.xx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx.xxxx# 
 How can I fix this? I do like to organize my data in sometimes deeply nested subdirectories.

 it behaves like this, no key was pressed, the cursor automatically moved to the top

                              <span>I created the package clean-kill-ring.el which solves a problem that I have long been annoyed with which is controlling what is allowed in the kill-ring.
 This package provides a clean-kill-ring-mode minor mode, that when active prevents any killed text that satisfies a predicate in clean-kill-ring-filters from entering the kill ring. By default the only active filter is string-blank-p to keep whitespace out of the kill ring.
 You can automatically remove duplicate items if you set clean-kill-ring-prevent-duplicates to a non-nil value.
 Hopefully some people find this useful.

                              <span>The built-in bibtex-mode provides a function bibtex-next-field which does what you&#x27;d expect: if we use &quot;|&quot; to represent point, calling bibtex-next-field from the following configuration: 
  @article{key, author &#x3D; {D|oe, Jane}, title &#x3D; {A paper}, ... 
 will take you to this configuration:
  @article{key, author &#x3D; {D|oe, Jane}, title &#x3D; {A paper|}, ... 
 I&#x27;m trying to define a bibtex-previous-field function that does the reverse, so I decided to look into the definition of bibtex-next-field, which is this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun bibtex-next-field (begin &amp;optional comma) &quot;Move point to end of text of next BibTeX field or entry head. With prefix BEGIN non-nil, move point to its beginning. Optional arg COMMA is as inbibtex-enclosing-field&#x27;. It is t for interactive calls.&quot; (interactive (list current-prefix-arg t)) (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) (if (not bounds) (setq end-of-entry t) (goto-char (nth 3 bounds)) (if (assoc-string (car bounds) &#x27;(&quot;@String&quot; &quot;@Preamble&quot;) t) (setq end-of-entry t) ;; BibTeX key or field (if (looking-at &quot;,[ \t\n]&quot;) (goto-char (match-end 0))) ;; end of entry (if (looking-at &quot;[)}][ \t\n]&quot;) (setq end-of-entry t)))) (if (and end-of-entry (re-search-forward bibtex-any-entry-maybe-empty-head nil t)) (goto-char (match-beginning 0))) (bibtex-find-text begin nil bibtex-help-message)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Unfortunately, I&#x27;m having trouble parsing this. What is the expression end-of-entry doing? I thought let expressions would take the following form: 
  (let ((VAR-1 VALUE-1) (VAR-2 VALUE-2) ... (VAR-n VALUE-n)) BODY) 
 but the first argument of let in the definition of bibtex-next-field seems to have a different form: 
  ... (let ((bounds (bibtex-find-text-internal t nil comma)) end-of-entry) BODY ... 
 Any help making sense of this would be much appreciated.

Trying to explore the potential of the new features for DSL constructions.

Reading from Cache
 Adding to Cache (With Expiration TIme)
 Updating Cache
  
Has someone done this before? Can someone point me to good resource on implementing the same? I tried to do it with a node server and it worked like a charm but while trying to do the same with Scala Play, I am still not getting good enough resources. Can someone help me and give me tips how to approach this to be time and speed efficient?

                              <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with a new form of inlining. Not sure if it has been done yet. The basic idea is to try to interpret the scala code and specialize at comp time, instead of traditionally inlining and constant folding. The following code failed to compile in my machine, reporting as  Main.scala:6:19 Maximal number of successive inlines (32) exceeded, Maybe this is caused by a recursive inline method? You can use -Xmax-inlines to change the limit. val result &#x3D; fib(i) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala inline def fib(a: Int): Int &#x3D; if a &lt;&#x3D; 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit &#x3D; val begin &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() val result &#x3D; fib(i) val tm &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s&quot;fib(${i})&#x3D;$result $tm ms&quot;)
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; timed_fib(2) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 If we take the interpreter and specializing approach, inline is not needed &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def fib(a: Int): Int &#x3D; if a &lt;&#x3D; 1 then a else fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2)
 def timed_fib(i: Int): Unit &#x3D; val begin &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() val result &#x3D; fib(i) val tm &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s&quot;fib(${i})&#x3D;$result $tm ms&quot;)
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; timed_fib(2)  will be optimized to scala def timed_fib_2: Uint &#x3D; val begin &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() val result &#x3D; 1 val tm &#x3D; System.currentTimeMillis() - begin println(s&quot;fib(${i})&#x3D;$result $tm ms&quot;)
 @main def main(): Unit &#x3D; timed_fib_2 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>I hope you won&#x27;t mind this somewhat off-topic post. It is about the Haskell community, but not technical.
 I have been participating in the Haskell community since 2009. In that time I have learned a great deal from Haskellers around the world including Eastern Europe. I have the greatest wish for the safety of all Haskellers, from all parts of the world. You are all my friends, even though we have only met virtually.

I&#x27;ve been using The Archive for about a year and a half and it has been a remarkable tool for me to organize my torrent of thoughts for a variety of projects. I especially love how I&#x27;m able to record my thoughts and surf through my notes without needing to take my fingers off the keyboard.
As I have gotten deeper into my research, I&#x27;ve found myself using LaTeX much more frequently, especially for mathematical purposes, and I&#x27;d imagine it will be necessary for other tasks as well. Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?

                              <span>Servant 0.19 was
released
earlier this month. It features a new combinator, called NamedRoutes, which
allows you to structure your APIs with records. Concretely, instead of building
up a tree of anonymous routes with (:):
type API &#x3D;
       PublicRoutes
  : &quot;admin&quot; :&gt; Auth &#x27;[BasicAuth] User :&gt; AdminRoutes

type PublicRoutes &#x3D;
       &quot;version&quot; :&gt; Get &#x27;[JSON] Version
  : …

type AdminRoutes &#x3D;
       &quot;do_stuff&quot; :&gt; ReqBody &#x27;[JSON] Request :&gt; Post &#x27;[JSON] Response
  : …

We can now write:
type API &#x3D; NamedRoutes NamedAPI

data NamedAPI mode &#x3D; NamedAPI
  { publicRoutes :: mode :- NamedRoutes PublicRoutes
  , adminRoutes  :: mode :-  &quot;admin&quot; :&gt; Auth &#x27;[BasicAuth] User :&gt; NamedRoutes AdminRoutes
  }
  deriving Generic

I can tell that they represent the same thing since they are isomorphic to each other, which is due to same cardinality. But other than this, i dont really see an advantage using TicTacToe2. 
 Is it a joke he proposed to make the book more enjoyable? I just dont get it.

                              <span>From TAPL by Pierce:
  
Kinds are built from a single atomic kind, written * and pronounced type, and a single constructor ?. They include, for example:
 * the kind of proper types (like Bool and Bool&#x3D;&gt;Bool)
 *&#x3D;&gt;* the kind of type operators (i.e., functions from proper types to proper types)
 *&#x3D;&gt;*&#x3D;&gt;* the kind of functions from proper types to type operators (i.e., two-argument operators)
 (*&#x3D;&gt;*)&#x3D;&gt;* the kind of functions from type operators to proper types
 Kinds, then, are the types of types. In essence, the system of kinds is a copy of the simply typed lambda-calculus, one level up.
  
If thinking of types as objects in a category, e.g. Hask in Haskell,
  
what is kind * in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the set of all the types, i.e. the object set of Hask?
 
What is kind *&#x3D;&gt;* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? Is it exactly the class Functor in Haskell?
 
What is kind *&#x3D;&gt;*&#x3D;&gt;* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask?
 
What is kind (*&#x3D;&gt;*)&#x3D;&gt;* in Haskell or in terms of category Hask? 
 
Are all the arrow kinds (*&#x3D;&gt;*, *&#x3D;&gt;*&#x3D;&gt;*, (*&#x3D;&gt;*)&#x3D;&gt;*, ...) exactly the classes defined by class in Haskell?
 
 Thanks.

                              <span>From Haskell&#x27;s specification,
  
Do expressions satisfy these identities, which may be used as a translation into the kernel, after eliminating empty stmts:
 do {e} &#x3D; e do {e;stmts} &#x3D; e &gt;&gt; do {stmts} do {p &gt;&#x3D; ok do {let decls; stmts} &#x3D; let decls in do {stmts} 
  
I often see that people wrote
 do {p &gt;&#x3D; (\p -&gt; do {stmts}) 
  
I was wondering when the shorten version works and when it doesn&#x27;t? (Does it work if and only if e is return(e&#x27;) for some e&#x27; that matches p?)
 
Can the one given in the specification be rewritten as a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; expression, for example, still by lambda expression? (The specification gives a let expression containing a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; expresssion, not exactly a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; expression itself)
 
 Thanks.

                              <span>From Haskell&#x27;s specification,
  
Do expressions satisfy these identities, which may be used as a translation into the kernel, after eliminating empty stmts:
 do {e} &#x3D; e do {e;stmts} &#x3D; e &gt;&gt; do {stmts} do {p &gt;&#x3D; ok do {let decls; stmts} &#x3D; let decls in do {stmts} 
  
According to the declaration of &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt;&#x3D; in class Monad:
  
In the second one, is e required to have a type m a, and is stmts required to have a type m b, where the type constructor m has been derived as an instance of class Monad?
 
In the third one, is e required to have a type m a, and p a type a and stmts a type b (so that ok a type a -&gt; m b), where the type constructor m has been derived as an instance of class Monad?
 
 Conversely, can an expression e &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f, where e is an expression with type m a, andf is a function with type a -&gt; m b, be equivalently converted to an do expression?
 What does the kernel of Haskel consist of exactly? (For example, does it include class Monad, but not do expression?)
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi everyone.
First off, in my brief stint being a member of this community, I must say how glad I am to have finally joined (after casually reading and lurking here from time to time, over the course of the past year).
I really love the editor and feel of writing on this forum. I like it better than Reddit. Shoutout to @ctietze
I just posted a new piece on my website. It&#x27;s titled, Who a Zettelkasten Is For (Especially an Analog One).
Here&#x27;s the link: https://scottscheper.com/letter/3/
I hope you enjoy it. Let me know any thoughts or comments you have on it.
I realize it&#x27;s my own opinion and some of you may have a different take. I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback or alternative take(s).
Best regards,
Scott</span>

 I plan to report on the success or failure of the initiative here.
 Has anybody got great mentoring experiences for Emacs? I would be interested to hear so that I could help best if anybody pings me to help them as a buddy!

                              <span>I am having a couple issues. I used to use mu4e for my gmail, and then switched away from mu4e to just using org-capture in the browser to capture the mails I need. This works well b/c the link to each email message is unique and persistent. However,
  
I recently started a job where we use an exchange server and access it online via outlook webmail. The org-capture browser function doesn&#x27;t work well for this because the link to the message is (1) not easily captured and (2) is not persistent, e.g., it changes when I move the message to a different folder
 So I started using mu4e again, but it appears that refiling does not seem to sync. When I refile messages in mu4e it somehow disappears and I can&#x27;t find it in outlook, even though the message is in the correct folder in my maildir. Why would this be? 
 I made a test folder in outlook to see if that would sync and it did sync, and the folder appeared in my maildir
 I then made that folder the location of my refile function, and same thing happened, the message disappeared and is no longer visible in outlook. 
 
  
Any thoughts on why refiling messages makes them disappear? Is it just some exchange server setting that I can&#x27;t get around, or is it an easy fix on my end? 
 Thank you!

 I use too much slang and abbreviations I don&#x27;t want to include in the dictionary and the lingering squiggle annoys and distracts.
 Can&#x27;t find a customization for this; am I missing it? Anyone have a code snippet I can use?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m using vhdl-mode a lot and just decided that it would be a great idea to include compiler vhdl-mode option into my workflow with Emacs. I have to say that I set custom file location for &quot;Easy configuration&quot; on Emacs. 
 (setq custom-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/emacs-custom.el&quot;)
 (load custom-file)
 To select compiler in vhdl-mode there are two ways, and it is little bit confusing to me. I want to use Xilinx XST compiler. Let me explain.
 First, you can select compiler from drop-down menu. There are Compiler1 and Compiler2 options. If you tinker with these options, some text is saved to my emacs-custom.el file, but I can&#x27;t see that something is configured there. To me it seems like it copied just to whole compilers list into that emacs-custom.el. Maybe it saves some options in other place too and I&#x27;m not aware of it?
 Second, which works, but its value is not saved anywhere! It looks like this. I have tried to put (vhdl-set-compiler &quot;Xilinx XST&quot;)
 and it returned that error that function is void. If I do it manually by fallowing vhdl-mode drop-down menu, and then selecting &quot;Xilinx XST&quot; compiler, it works. But just in this emacs session. After the restart of emacs, I have to do it again manually :/ 
 my emacs-custom.el : https://pastebin.com/iaTQbK17
 my init.el : https://pastebin.com/4GNLJMQB
 Any help is appreciated :)

 However, I would like to swap ctrl and alt (meta) just in Emacs not in the whole OS.
 I usually trust my google-fu. However the last few days it did fail me. Help, please help.

 I&#x27;m trying to make lsp-pyright load pyrightconfig.json so I can have types from stubs using mypy for qtile. I&#x27;ve tried creating a pyrightconfig.json, a pyproject.toml, setting lsp-custom-settings and nothing worked. Since it is for qtile I can&#x27;t use virtualenvs too.
 Any idea what can I do?

I performed the U command just to see what it would mark, and it did not mark &quot;org&quot; with an I. But my current org version is 9.4.4, and the latest one is 9.5.2. Why didn&#x27;t U mark my org for installation?

Let&#x27;s start by configuring lsp-mode which is a client for LSP servers:
 (use-package lsp-mode :hook (prog-mode . lsp))
 (use-package lsp-ui)
  
Okay, great it&#x27;s a piece of code. but am I supposed to copy/paste that code somewhere? run it? bask in it&#x27;s glory? do I have to restart emacs?
 Also where in the Emacs for beginners tutorials does it explain what to do with such a configuration snippet? If you have a lot of configuration how do you organize it?
 If I need to find out what configuration options are available for a package (like tramp on windows, how do I tell it to use TortoiseGitPlink.exe instead of Plink.exe) how do I discover it?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;d like to write an embark function for the consult-ripgrep.
 This function can add the current file name to the search prompt.
 What I mean:
 The consult ripgrep prompt is: #whatilookfor
 and after the embark action the prompt is: #whatilookfor -- -g filename*.differentextension
 I can image that if we add this &quot;-- -g filename*.differentextension&quot; to the consult-history and I can reach it with M-p maybe it can be a different good solution 
 I would like to use it to search the string in the files with same name but different extensions.
 It would be useful under the angular development for me ...
 If you can send me an example where an embark function modify the consult prompt could be enough for me 
 sorry for the question but I have no a lot of time to write code for emacs ... :(

This leaves a big blob of ‘events’ in my calendar for today’s date which is a bit annoying. Is there a way to stop it putting DTSTAMP and DTSTART entries into the .ics files when the item has no date?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Sorry for the basic question. I was reading that both native compilation and pure gtk were both merged. I&#x27;m on fedora 35. What is the best way to install emacs with these features? Do I have to build it from source? And if so are there specific flags or options that need to be enabled for it to be compiled with those options enabled? or are they enabled by default now?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I managed to build it from source using the following and it (mostly) works:
 Into a directory: git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
 Then ran: ./autogen.sh in that directory
 Then ran: ./configure --with-pgtk --with-native-compilation --with-mailutils
 It kept failing until I installed all the following additional packages with sudo dnf install:
  
autoconf (to run the ./autogen.sh command)
 texinfo (for the makeinfo requirement)
 gtk3-devel (for the pgtk requirement)
 libgccjit-devel (for the native-comp requirement)
 gnutls-devel (because it needed gnutls-devel)
 ncurses-devel (it needed something in this package but I forget what)
  
Then ran make (took a while) then sudo make install in the directory and it installed! Emacs 29 I believe to /usr/local/bin

 Is there anybody who can use intellisense in the angular html files ?
 if I set the lsp-log-io then I see this:
 [Trace - 08:24:30 ] Sending request &#x27;textDocument/definition - (108)&#x27;.
 Params: {
 &quot;textDocument&quot;: {
 &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;file:///home/ ... .component.html&quot;
 },
 &quot;position&quot;: {
 &quot;line&quot;: 21,
 &quot;character&quot;: 21
 }
 }
 [Trace - 08:24:30 ] Received response &#x27;textDocument/definition - (108)&#x27; in 24ms.
 Result: null
 the html file is here:
 &lt;li *ngFor&#x3D;&quot;let courseType of category!.courseTypes&quot;
 ​
 for this configuration the vscode give normal intellisense here ...

 Use case: There are some files I want to edit as another user in a remote server (is old laptop used as server and is in my living room), I wish to execute dired instead of visiting a file so I can see all of the contents of the folder holding the files, but I would like to do this as another user and wish to switch to this user using sudo as these files are owned by him. I log in as my user on the remote server using SSH keys.
 How do I do that with TRAMP?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Doom Emacs and I&#x27;ve been trying to get Latex equation preview working in emacs for a while now. When every I try to toggle latex preview with C-c C-x C-l it keeps giving me the error in the title. 
 I went to check and tested in the Terminal:
 orgtexgvRQwY.dvi wasn&#x27;t produced. but there was an orgtexgvRQwY.tex file
 Running Latex orgtexgvRQwY.tex creates a .dvi file of the same name
 Running dvipng ortexgvRQwY.dvi creates a .png file but with an extra [1] at the end. 
 I&#x27;ve looked around forums but the other solutions doesn&#x27;t seem to have worked. 
 Another problem is for some reason on every startup, i always get this warning

 It does not list the files in project.

 * Level 1 Some text, two blank lines after some more text, two (or more) blank lines below! * Level 2 Some other text blah blah blah * Level 3 Some other text 
 When that&#x27;s folded up, it looks like this:
 * Level 1 * Level 2 * Level 3 
 I&#x27;d like all instances of two or more trailing blank lines to be condensed into one trailing blank line so I get a clean tree like this:
 * Level 1 * Level 2 * Level 3

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So, I&#x27;ve been exploring ways of implementing &quot;type-dependent&quot;(i think this is the name) validations! But I just stepped into a doubt that is related to &quot;scala-specific&quot; knowledge.
 Lets imagine that I have the following error trait:
 scala sealed trait DomainError trait ValidationError extends DomainError 
 and I want to specify a generic interface for a given Id type that wraps a primitive! This is what I thought on writing:
 scala trait Id[ValueType] type Value val value: ValueType 
 First question: - Is this the right way of writing a trait which defines something like a ProductId that is, basically, Id[UUID]?
 Second Question: - How can I define the interface for the apply method which I should return something like Either[ValidationError[ProductId], ProductId]]?

                              <span>In my work often it happens that I get a call to provide immediate support. Only after the call register it under my Support Headline with a full description of the issue and update my org clock time accordingly. 
 As such, I would like to create an org capture template (or function) that does the following: 
 - request how much time has pass since I receive the call 
 - with this time, clock out of my current task with the time of when I receive the call
 - create a new heading under my *Support* heading and include a clock drawer already with the time I spent on the task. Fill new headline as I want (title, description, etc.) 
 - (optional) clock in again to the task I was working
 I almost got everything done, however it seems that calling &#x3D;org-clock-out&#x3D; from within the capture template makes it so that the new heading is not in the right place. 
 If someone has any ideas on how to achieve this let me know. Below you can see my capture template and function:
  (&quot;cc&quot; &quot;Support&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/todos.org&quot; &quot;Support&quot;) &quot;%(call-interactively #&#x27;custom/quick-support)&quot; :empty-lines 1) (defun custom/quick-support (minutes-started) (interactive &quot;NMinutes:&quot;) (let ((support-start-time (encode-time (decoded-time-add (decode-time) (make-decoded-time :minute (- minutes-started)))))) ;; If clocked in a task, stopped it when support started (org-clock-out nil t support-start-time) (concat &quot;* %?\n :CLOCKING:\n CLOCK: &quot; (format-time-string &quot;[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]&quot; support-start-time) &quot;--&quot; ;; Insert dummy &#x3D;&gt; and let Org calculate it afterwards (format-time-string &quot;[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]&quot;) &quot; &#x3D;&gt; \n:END:\n&quot;)))

                              <span>As the title says, I have two unrelated questions. I have been assigned to do a task to cover for someone. This largely entails copying details out of a template and pasting it into an excel doc. Due to the variety of the email responses, I copy a block from Outlook to an org file and format, then paste into Excel. For example, a person&#x27;s name is two cells, I found it was quicker for me to put the first and last names on separate lines then copy, esp after I customized copy*.
 1- can I somehow copy the text, so if I copy multiple lines, it fills the cells correctly? Ex first name is column A, last in b.
 2- I have set up an org file, to dump this data, via capture, mostly so I can easily keep a log of when I enter due to an unrelated headache. I have a custom DONE keyword and associated it with a key, but more than often I accidentally have shift held, so org-todo quits. Is there a way to apply my keyword regardless if i press a or A for example? In org-capture, if I assigned a, but do A, we&#x27;re told to try again. I am aware that allowing this could cause issues if I assign lower and upper to keywords.
 my function
  (defun me/kill-ring-save () &quot;Adds to line to kill-ring if not marked, and puts a message in the minibuffer. If something is marked, that region is added.&quot; (interactive) (if (equal mark-active nil) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (line-end-position)) (message &quot;Copied the line!&quot;) ) (progn (kill-ring-save (point) (mark)) (message &quot;Copied selected region!&quot;) ) ) )

What I want is an html (or pdf) that contains Header 1 and subtree only, with the file named &quot;Name I want&quot;. What I&#x27;m getting is a filename of &quot;Title&quot;.
 What I do is narrow-to-subtree so only Header 1 is showing, then C-c C-e h o.
 Files are easy enough to rename in dired or whatever, but I don&#x27;t understand why emacs isn&#x27;t producing what I want.
 This is Doom Emacs (27.2) and org-version 9.6

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am currently using Doom emacs however I have tested this on Vanilla and Centaur emacs and the results were the same. When I open my org agenda file, Every org file (with the org agenda folder thing) is thrown open which makes my workspace very cluttered with org files. IS there a way to automagically close them after saving.

 The contents of the headline below is commented out. But it&#x27;s still showing up in my agenda. Is there a way to comment out example so it doesn&#x27;t get parsed by agenda?

                              <span>I am trying to get this to work to immediately activate a defun that I just added to my init.el (instead of closing and reopening emacs). I thought eval-defun should work. Alternatively, C-x C-e worked fine. So first question is why doesn&#x27;t this work, and a second question, I guess, is when should I use each version?
 I don&#x27;t know if it matters, but my init.el indicates it&#x27;s an &quot;(Emacs-Lisp Eldoc)&quot;. Here&#x27;s the function:
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; help with parens (show-paren-mode t) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; emacs needs an unfill ;;; Stefan Monnier . It is the opposite of fill-paragraph (defun unfill-paragraph (&amp;optional region) &quot;Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text.&quot; (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) &#x27;(t))) (let ((fill-column (point-max)) ;; This would override &#x60;fill-column&#x27; if it&#x27;s an integer. (emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column t)) (fill-paragraph nil region))) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ;; Some font choices (setq myfont &quot;InputSerif&quot;) 
 With the point in or immediately after the defun, executing C-M-x aka M-x eval-defun prints &quot;InputSerif&quot; in the minibuffer.
 EDIT: Added extra context to my snippet, command above and below.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to understand how to get Emacs working to indent C++ code the way I want it to. Namely, I want to get rid of hanging braces in my code.
 I know you can select a region and auto indent it by pressing C-M-\, however that doesn&#x27;t seem to remove hanging braces even though my style is set to not have hanging braces.
 For example, if I highlight the following function and run auto indent
 test_function(void) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is a test&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; } 
 I would like it to become 
 test_function(void){ std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is a test&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; } 
 but it doesn&#x27;t. Anyone know how to make emacs do this?
 Thanks,

                              <span>I was looking at using Flycheck today with lsp-mode, and I got a warning from lsp-mode. A quick google lead me to a github issue for lsp-mode that said it&#x27;s a common problem and that Flycheck was going to release a new version that fixed it. There was linked issue from that one to a github issue on Flycheck&#x27;s repo about releasing said version from 2020, with no actual traction on finishing the release.
 There haven&#x27;t been any commits to master since August 2021, regardless of the fact that there are 45 open pull requests, and users requesting that a new release be cut for 2 years. Their CI jobs don&#x27;t run anymore because they&#x27;re linked to travis-ci.org which has been in read-only mode since July 2021 and no longer accepts new build jobs.
 Is Flycheck dead? Are people just using snapshots from the repo to make it work? Is there a forked version someone is actually mantaining?

                              <span>I have an idea for something I want to build for emacs, but I&#x27;m having some trouble getting started. I have experience with common lisp so I&#x27;m not too worried about the actual coding part of this (though the whole dynamic scope of it all sounds interesting) mainly what I&#x27;m missing is a guide to things like dependency management, package organization, basic things like that. If anyone here could help me out with these issues I would really appreciate it.

                              <span>Anyone have a working emacs config for Svelte that they can share? I’ve enabled svelte-mode and installed the svelte-ls lsp server, but things like lsp-find-definition just error out and ask me to check lsp-describe-server, which shows that the server is alive, but not much else. Any tips? I have to explore a codebase, and being able to quickly follow definitions is key.

                              <span>Hi all, thought I&#x27;d share a way to control the volume of EMMS using MPV as a backend. I couldn&#x27;t find any solutions on the net, and this took quite a bit of trial and error so hopefully this will save you some pain. 
  (defvar emms-player-mpv-volume 100) (defun emms-player-mpv-get-volume () &quot;Sets &#x60;emms-player-mpv-volume&#x27; to the current volume value and sends a message of the current volume status.&quot; (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x27;(get_property volume) #&#x27;(lambda (vol err) (unless err (let ((vol (truncate vol))) (setq emms-player-mpv-volume vol) (message &quot;Music volume: %s%%&quot; vol)))))) (defun emms-player-mpv-raise-volume (&amp;optional amount) (interactive) (let* ((amount (or amount 10)) (new-volume (+ emms-player-mpv-volume amount))) (if (&gt; new-volume 100) (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x27;(set_property volume 100)) (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x60;(add volume ,amount)))) (emms-player-mpv-get-volume)) (defun emms-player-mpv-lower-volume (&amp;optional amount) (interactive) (emms-player-mpv-cmd &#x60;(add volume ,(- (or amount &#x27;10)))) (emms-player-mpv-get-volume)) 
 For reference my emms-player-mpv-parameters is set to &#x27;(&quot;--quiet&quot; &quot;--really-quiet&quot; &quot;--no-audio-display&quot; &quot;--force-window&#x3D;no&quot; &quot;--vo&#x3D;null&quot; &quot;--no-resume-playback&quot;)

 I think the most useful part for those already in the know-how will be my configuration of Vertico&#x27;s &quot;extensions,&quot; which I haven&#x27;t seen much coverage on.

I have discovered zettelkasten(ing) a few weeks ago and it arrived at a perfect timing! I am reorganizing my whole “knowledge management” and my workflow.  As a dad of two small kids, the primary caretaker of a house and a phd candidate during pandemic times (I don’t know what went through my head to pursue that route), I highly need some effectivity.
I have started my own zettelkasten and I am trying at the same time to understand how the zettelkasten system works and most importantly how to make it most effective for me. And let’s be honest, I am really torn between analog and digital and see benefits in both. I like the tactile and sensory aspect of the analog, and I like the effectiveness of the digital, plus I learn a lot on software and programmes (thanks to you Forum, markdown has come to my knowledge and I am learning how to use it).
Cheers!</span>

                              <span>I was wondering how to understand in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor
  
Applicative functors are the programming equivalent of lax monoidal functors with tensorial strength in category theory.
  
In Haskell&#x27;s, class Applicative is defined as
 class Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Applicative f where pure::a-&gt;fa ()::f(a-&gt;b)-&gt;fa-&gt;fb 
 A monoidal functor is defined in Mac Lane&#x27;s book Category Theory for Working Mathematicians, on p164 in VII.1. Monoidal Categories 
  
A (strict) morphism of monoidal categories 
 T: (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho)-&gt;(B&#x27;, *&#x27;, e&#x27;, alpha, lambda, rho), 
 is a functor T: B-B&#x27; such that, for all a, b, c, f, and g 
 T(a*b)&#x3D;Ta *&#x27; Tb, T(f*g) &#x3D; Tf *&#x27; Tg, Te&#x3D;e&#x27;, (10) T alpha_{a,b,c} &#x3D; alpha&#x27;_{Ta, Tb, Tc}, T lambda_a &#x3D; lambda&#x27;_{Ta}, T rho &#x3D; rho&#x27;_{Ta}. (11) 
  
How can an instance of class Applicative be viewed as a lax monoidal functor? 
 What is the underlying monoidal category (B, *, e, alpha, lambda, rho) for an instance of Applicative in Haskell?
 What is &quot;lax&quot; here?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Due to syntactic flexibility with do notation, I really can&#x27;t see a single language paradigm that Haskell can&#x27;t emulate. While Prelude gets a lot of shit, it&#x27;s so minimal and unopinionated that it really encourages creating language features as libraries. With QuasiQuoters you can take this to a logical extreme, convincing the compiler to compile whatever you want essentially. It seems to take very little convincing to get the language to do anything you want in the way you want as long as it&#x27;s logically well formed.
 Personally as someone who loves programming language design it&#x27;s really incredible, if there&#x27;s a feature in another language that I want to try, I don&#x27;t have to switch languages, I can find a package or just stub out an implementation in a weekend. I&#x27;ve heard this used as a point against Haskell however, because it lets you work with very bizzare computational models and can make a code base feel kind of disjointed. Personally, I don&#x27;t buy that, while Haskell does have modules that let you differ from the norm, the norm tends to be the easiest option. You CAN have Alan Kay style objects, you CAN have prolog style logic programming, but why would you when the language is still so effective without them. Of course, eDSLs are a thing too, tho they&#x27;re less hot pluggable language features and more an incredibly nice design pattern that arises naturally from the language design unless they&#x27;re designed to operate more generically.
 Anyway, Haskell is cool and I wanted to talk about it, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here.

                              <span>I am making a Haskell application that uses a lot of libraries, mostly for things like parsing (megaparsec, aeson, etc) and eventually some RPC or other inter-process library. I have noticed that many of these libraries will return some kind of &quot;Result&quot; type for actions that can fail, often an Either String a or Maybe a or their own custom Result a type. I find it somewhat vexing how these different error types cannot mix because they carry different information, and I would like to be able to propagate them to a higher level in my program where the errors can be handled properly.
 To this end I have added a monadic Result type for my own application that is roughly data Result a &#x3D; Valid a | Invalid Error where Error is my own error sum type that can represent any external error that the program might have to handle. Result has the obvious Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances, and I use it to wrap most actions that can fail including reading and writing files, parsing, validating user input, and so on.
 Is this a good approach? It seems a little unwieldy to set up so many wrapper functions, but it pays off when I can handle the errors so much more smoothly at the top level. Is there some better method I am missing?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am having trouble with my org-mode. Whenever I have a heading, like &quot;* This is a heading&quot; and press RET, I used to be brought to a newline, and moved inwards 3 characters. However, when I press RET currently, under a heading such as in this example, point is not moved, and remains at 0 instead of being moved to 3. Interestingly, when I am in auto-fill-mode, when the text begins to wrap around, it will indent appropriately. I have also found that C-o also does not indent, and is effectively the same as C-j
 I am not sure what has changed, but I am in wayland currently, and I don&#x27;t think that should have and impact on expected performance, but I would never know.
 I tried org-indent-mode to see if that is what I was missing, but that seems to be doing something else entirely.
 ​
 EDIT: fixed, i had to set org-adapt-indentation
 https://orgmode.org/manual/Hard-indentation.html#DOCF150
 ​
 EDIT2: This change does not seem to be working out, actually. I thought it would, but I still get put at 0 instead of 3 spaces when I use RET under a headline.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m curious to see how you plan your long term goals with org-mode. I&#x27;m interested in workflows and your thoughts.
 In general, I&#x27;m pretty successful managing my day to day with org-mode:
  
I have a project list 
 each project is divided into subtasks
  
I push the projects along by executing tasks and reviewing my projects relatively regularly. It&#x27;s a functional system. In general things don&#x27;t fall through the cracks.
 However, I feel like most of my planning is short term. This is where &quot;tactical vs strategic&quot; in the title comes from. I&#x27;m having trouble elaborating on what I really mean, here.
 Do you have long term goals, if so how do you work with them in org mode?

                              <span>As an imperative programmer working with Kotlin most of the time i now want to expand my horizon with Haskell. 
 From my one semester of Haskell in university I know the basic concepts, but I now want to write a full backend in Haskell.
 I have been using Kotlins Flows for quite a while, and I am looking for something similar in Haskell. Specifically I want to be able to notify other threads about changes, so they can react to them, but not in an active waiting way. In Kotlin I would use a StateFlow or a SharedFlow for this. I&#x27;ve seen the pipes library which looks very similar, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out to use it in a way, where I have to update a value in one place and all threads are notified about it.
 Probably I am still thinking too much in an imperative way, but maybe you can help me go into the right direction. Thank you for your help.

                              <span>If Foo a b is my type class, f :: a can&#x27;t be a method, as the compiler complains that f is now ambiguous (which seems to me to be true but only as long as there are multiple instances). But it seems to me that even if I replaced f with g :: (a,b) then g is still ambiguous (again, if I have multiple instances). So why is there that restriction?
 I am aware of FunctionalDependencies, but it seems to me that it shouldn&#x27;t be required that b is uniquely determined by a. Am I missing something?

                              <span>When you have a high level language it seams easier to desugar it to a small core language when type checking. However I don&#x27;t understand how type errors can then be reversed back to the original syntax. What are known strategies for doing this? It seems like you would have to litter your core AST with annotations of some kind, is this what most people do?
 I remember reading somewhere that haskell implements the typechecker closer to the original syntax because then it is easier to relate errors to the original source. However there is still some desugaring that occurs, and I&#x27;m wondering if there is a sweet spot in balancing desugaring vs tracking original source?

                              <span>Since GHC 8.10 you can use -Wunused-packages to find deps in your package.yaml which you&#x27;ve stopped using!
 Removing them might reduce build times and also reduce potential future problems with version bounds.

 Anyway, that’s beside the point. I wanted to write the degree Celsius symbol and so I did C-X 8 Ret 2103, and lo and behold, there it was. 
 But after that whenever I wrote, emacs just wrote very slowly. This got fixed when I removed the Celsius symbol. The encoding is and always has been utf-8. 
 This is not pogchamp.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I set (global-linum-mode 1) in my init.el file, but it creates problems when viewing pdfs. Scrolling through them becomes sluggish. Removing the line numbering altogether fixes the problem. But I do want line numbering for when writing code/latex.
 I tried setting (add-hook &#x27;pdf-view-mode-hook (lambda() (linum-mode -1))), which I found here. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.
 Can someone help me and if possible explain to me(noob) why it doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I installed csharp-mode from Melpa. 
 I don&#x27;t have csharp-mode hooks enabled in my dot emacs, so I load a &quot;.cs&quot; file, and then type &quot;M-x csharp-mode&quot;. I get this error:
 Symbol’s chain of function indirections contains a loop: R-mode 
 Syntax highlighting does NOT occur (except for strings and comments, for some reason). However, the mode line does say that csharp-mode IS activated for the file. 
 I don&#x27;t understand why R-mode is involved with this process at all. I do have ESS installed.
 Here is the information for the package:

                              <span>TopSpace is useful when using Emacs in full-screen on large monitors, now available in MELPA. It lets you scroll above the top line like having a scroll-able top margin/padding.

Suggested web browsers? Browser Extensions? Emacs packages? Especially, of course, systems or workflows that somehow integrate with emacs/org-mode, either directly or indirectly.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>I&#x27;ve been spending hours trying to figure this out, but was unable to find anything online with any working examples of what I&#x27;m looking for.
 ​
 What I want to do is have one of my Akka-HTTP routes return a response like this:
 [ { name: &quot;test&quot;, age: 24 }, { name: &quot;test 2&quot;, age: 21 } ] 
 The issue is that the spray-json and akka tutorials only show you how to return a response like this:
 { users: [ { name: &quot;test&quot;, age: 24 }, { name: &quot;test 2&quot;, age: 21 } ] } 
 While messing around, I tried creating a simple route an an immutable sequence of users like so
 case class User(name: String, age: Int) // ... val usersTest &#x3D; Seq(User(&quot;test, 24), User(&quot;test 2&quot;, 21)) val routes: Route &#x3D; { ... route code get { // Should return an array of the users complete(usersTest) } } 
 But the above code throws the following error:
 type mismatch; found : Seq[User] required: akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling.ToResponseMarshallable 
 I&#x27;m having a hard time following why that error is being thrown when I have my jsonFormats defined already:
 implicit val userJsonFormat &#x3D; jsonFormat2(User) 
 ​
 How can I make the route respond with a simple JSON array of the users? I don&#x27;t want to respond with an object containing a users array, I want the endpoint to respond with an array of the users.
 ​
 Any help is much appreciated!
 Edit: I feel dumb. Thanks for the help!

                              <span>We have just released new versions of both Indigo (game engine) and Tyrian (Elm-like web framework). They&#x27;ve been release together because they now work together!
 As well as lots of other improvements, you are now able to build a web app in Tyrian that natively launches and communicates with Indigo web games as first class citizens, from within the same Scala codebase.
 The motivating use case was for people who wanted to use Indigo to render their games, but who also wanted a slick, responsive HTML5 based UI to drive it.
 Please note that both minor releases follow an unannounced major release a week ago, so do check out the release notes for both. 
 Indigo 0.12.1 - https://indigoengine.io/
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.0
 https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo/releases/tag/v0.12.1
 Tyrian 0.3.1 - http://tyrian.indigoengine.io/

 ​
 A massive thank you to all the wonderful people who have sponsored us, contributed code, reviewed PR&#x27;s, written/proof read docs, raised issues, discussed solutions, or bravely shared their work in progress games and apps! You make it all worth while. 😊

                              <span>Hi!
 I attempt to gather all ideas/approaches that were in usage to manage app dependencies. As far as I see there are two survivors nowadays: - mix of constructors/implicits in Tagless Final world - &quot;Reader on steroids&quot; represented by ZIO (Reader channel, Has[T], and ZLayer) and cats-mtl (Ask[F, T] feature) (thanks to u/LuciaDenniard for bringing the second option)
 I want to write a note with a review of which things were in usage but were washed out.
 The roster I have:
  
Dependency rejection. Just an idea to push any IO to the edges and not mix with logic.
 Dependency injection frameworks (Guice-like)
 Cake pattern.
 Dependency parameterization (dependencies as function parameters).
 Reader monad (as is)
 
 Resources I found useful: - &quot;Readers vs Constructors: Dependency Injection showdown&quot; and &quot;Reader &amp; Constructor-based Dependency Injection - friend or foe?&quot; by u/adamw1pl - &quot;Dependency Injection in Functional Programming&quot; Gist by Gabriel Volpe - Cake antipattern by Mateusz Kubuszok - &quot;Six approaches to dependency injection&quot; from &quot;F# for Fun and Profit&quot; - &quot;Dependency rejection&quot; and &quot;Partial application is dependency injection&quot; by Mark Seemann
 I&#x27;ll be grateful for any additional resources and/or points I&#x27;ve missed.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am new to Org, so I may have missed something obvious but, reading the Quick start guide or the documentation, I am not sure to understand how export is supposed to work in regards to headings. Quoting the Quick start Guide:
  
Lines that start with an asterisk * are headings. 
 A single * denotes a 1st-level heading, ** denotes a 2nd-level heading, etc.
  
So far, everything is clear. We have headings, with levels. Fine. Where I stop following is when I export, say to a html buffer (C-c C-e h H) every heading level has been decreased: one star headings are tagged as h2 and two stars as h3. Here, on a very basic test file: 
 https://preview.redd.it/p9pbaypvm8j81.png?width&#x3D;1165&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;23832603cda8cec5ff07bd711f661d8fe71f2902
 Since I am rather new to Org and to Emacs, I imagined I had some issue with my Org configuration or that I screwed up something elsewhere in Emacs, as I so often do. So I tried on a clean install (no ~/.emacs.d, no init.el) and got the same result, on a Debian 11 machine btw. 
 What&#x27;s bugging me is that I can&#x27;t find mention of this in the doc. 
 Could you tell me if it is the expected behavior? And if so, is there a way to tell Org to preserve the original heading levels?
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Apologies if this had been asked before (if it has I was not able to find it): since the latest changes in the repos I realized that my emacs (27.1) runs Org 9.4.4 as its installed version but also counts Org 9.5.2. I have three questions:
  
Is this the expected behaviour?
 Can I trim this down to one Org version, preferably the 9.5.2 and the generally speaking the most recent one?
 If this is the expected behaviour what is the purpose of each Org version? I find it strange that I cannot use the most recent stable version but still need it for dependencies.

                              <span>A lil something I wrote today. Figured someone in here might get something out of it.  Citations are still just reminders for later.
The inclusion of the zettelkasten into the lexicon of contemporary productivity scenes, many of which view note-taking systems through the lens of task and project management, has led to confusion as to what a zettelkasten is and for what it can be used. This confusion becomes particularly apparent when comparing zettelkasten to other note-taking methodologies, where the zettelkasten is seen as an advanced (and sometimes outdated) way to store and retrieve notes. I&#x27;d like to argue that the zettelkasten should not be considered within the lineage of agnostic note-storing systems and apps, but rather as something else entirely: a note-making and note-linking me…</span>

Last Week
Completed the initial processing of notes from the biography of John Cage Where The Heart Beats 202107261132.
Spent too much time fretting about the Science Profile assignment interview that never happened.
Looked again at Zettlr then settled back into The Archive.
This Week
I&#x27;ll add deep links and atomize Where The Heart Beats 202107261132. I&#x27;ll start a second refactoring.
Attack Style: Toward Clarity And Grace 202111181949
Work in Keyboard Maestro, which just released version 10!
I plan to develop my workflow with The Archive as a poor man&#x27;s Scrivener.</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I have a sequence of semigroups, for example strings and arrays. I want to fold all of them with append, producing a sequence of the folded values.
 I imagine different semigroups have different implementations of append. However, while the compiler can know it&#x27;ll have to deal with some manner of semigroup, it cannot know ahead of time what each member may be. How is the correct function ultimately determined? Is there some runtime check with the equivalent of typeof/instanceof which decides the correct function?
 I guess a related question is what happens in practice if data don&#x27;t match their type? For example, if I ask a database for data, expecting a sequence of integers, but a cosmic ray conspires to ruin my day, and I end up getting garbage. Obviously this is a runtime error, but how can I reason about it or deal with it?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used them infrequently enough and used different ones every time. And then when I ask people about it, I get 10x different answers. 
 I just want a simple (synchronous) HTTP client and JSON parser (where I can make case classes to extract what I need). Now when I look I try one out and the example doesn&#x27;t compile in 2.11, or I try another one out and the client is overkill, etc. 
 I have interviews next week, and I just want the simplest go-to HTTP Client/json parser that I don&#x27;t have to think too hard about. There are so many options that this becomes a really frustrating exercise. 
 Kind of a rant, but also a cry for help.

                              <span>Hello all,
I recently discovered the Zettelkasten system and thought it seemed a disciplinary and constructive tool for someone who makes connections between ideas all day long but doesn&#x27;t write them down (like me). I&#x27;ve gotten as far as downloading Obsidian, reading the first chapter of a book called &quot;The Bitcoin Standard,&quot; writing fleeting notes, and then polishing the relevant ones into literature notes. What repeatedly evades my understanding, however, is the nature of links.
I do not know when or how to use links. For example, if I have a note that defines the economic term &quot;coincidence of wants,&quot; and I have another note discussing how &quot;indirect exchange enables coincidence of wants in a diverse economy,&quot; should I: reference &quot;coincidence&quot; inside &quot;indirect exchange&quot;; reference &quot;indirect exchange&quot; in &quot;coincidence&quot;; do both of those; not link them at all but tag both notes with &quot;coincidence of wants&quot; and find them when I do the color-coded tag search?
And then there&#x27;s the matter of linking two (seemingly) unrelated ideas. Do they get linked to each other, and then to a third note of the new idea they inspire? Both notes separately linked to the third?
Help is appreciated.</span>

                              <span>As a novice Zettler introduced to the method via the Cortex podcast, I’ve been taking the last year or so to build up the foundations of a useful archive. I’ve come to an inflection point in the management of my archive, as I’ve done a lot of collecting and not a lot of assimilating, linking, etc. Of course, at this new stage, it’s only natural that I’ve stumbled upon the Great Folgezettel Debate. After going on a deep dive in the forums for the past week, I’ve come to the point where I’d like to start weighing the tradeoffs between the two most prevalent organizational techniques I see discussed here: Folgezettel and Structure Zettel (Structure Notes?

I’ve looked around online but haven’t found anything that definitely addresses how to setup something up for a personal programming language.
 Does anyone here know what I should do, or where I should go look?

 I am looking for setting up auto-complete capabilities and code checking in emacs. I mostly want this for Python and C++, although having the capability to easily add other languages in the future would be much appreciated.
 What packages do you recommend for setting up emacs as an ide?

                              <span>I would like to bind C-h/j/k/l to move emacs windows (evil normal mode). 
 Binding globally, every one of these works except C-k. It will NOT move to the upper window in either Eshell or term, normal mode or no. I tried to use bind* from use-package, I tried general, I tried so many things I&#x27;ve lost count, but I can&#x27;t use C-k for the real shell or the Eshell. Why is this, and is there a sane way around it? For now I&#x27;ve settled down on using arrows:
  (general-define-key :states &#x27;normal &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-left &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-right &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-down &quot;&quot; &#x27;windmove-up) 
 But I am not happy about it. Doubly so because I just don&#x27;t understand why no override works.

But I don&#x27;t want to have to ⌘-TAB (or ALT-TAB in Windows) over to emacs and then C-c c to org-capture. That takes too much time and breaks my flow. I just want to press some magic MacOS (or Windows) key that will automagically switch me to emacs AND do the org-capture command.
 Bonus points if doing the above can also automatically carry over the URL that I&#x27;m currently on.
 I assume I&#x27;d need to use some kind of &quot;macro&quot; software.

                              <span>Cross post from https://fillian.me/code/bongo-retag/
 ​
 bongo is a package for listening to music within Emacs.
 I keep all my music on my computer with filenames readable by bongo like this:
 Artist - Album - Track Num - Song Name.mp3
 ​
 I like having all the metadata stored in the filename instead of in internal ID3 tags for a few reasons:
  
filenames are easy to change
 everything is visible at a glance
 it stops me from spending too much time re-tagging and organizing my library
  
​
 The problem is that when I sync my music library to my phone using Syncthing, the music app I use doesn&#x27;t read the metadata from the filename - it uses the standard ID3 tags.
 ​
 My solution was to write a small script which reads metadata from the filename and overwrites the internal ID3 tags to match.
 Whenever I add new music to my library, I&#x27;ll run this script and then I&#x27;ll be able to browse easily on my phone. The source of truth for metadata will always be the filename.
 ​
 The script is written in Python and requires a library called eyeD3
 You can find the it here
 Pass the script a directory and it will re-tag all the .mp3 files inside and in any sub-directories.
 ​
 It&#x27;s nice to have album cover images when listening on my phone, so the script will overwrite a cover image if there is a file that matches Artist - Album.jpg in the same directory as the mp3.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m following the system crafters&#x27; guide &quot;emacs from scratch&quot;, and in the video on LSP, I wrote down the three things he says are needed:
 1. a backend (lsp-mode in his case)
 2. a frontend (typescript-mode in his case)
 3. a language server (ts-ls in his case)
 So I was wondering if this scheme holds true even for c/c++, if so, what packages for these three &quot;categories&quot; do I need?

                              <span>Hi Emacsers,
 recently I&#x27;ve been playing with org-element and org-export.
 Specifically, I was interested in the mechanism of the org exporter system and its flexibility.
 The goal of this post is to get you started with the creation of org backends.
 To do so, we build an org backend that:
  
keeps only bold elements,
 surrounds bold elements with *** before and after,
 surrounds paragraph elements with :: before and after,
 surrounds section elements with  after (removing the last newline).
  
We call it onlybold.
 Before, we start, if you are interested, I recommend you to read in org-mode&#x27;s source code the following files:
  
lisp/ox.el,
 lisp/ox-html.el,
 lisp/ox-md.el,
 lisp/ox-org.el,
 testing/lisp/test-ox.el (AMAZING).
  
You can get org-mode&#x27;s source code by runn…</span>

                              <span>Maybe there&#x27;s a package for this already or some clever solution?
 I want to have 2 (vertical) buffers open with the same file, with the right buffer containing what comes just after the bottom of left buffer.
 Then when I scroll in either buffer, the other will move too, so that I&#x27;m always seeing one long(er) continuous portion of the file on my laptop&#x27;s unrotatable wide-ass screen.
 Does that even make sense? Thanks for reading!

 Is there a way to do a generic path? I&#x27;m using nix to install my emacs packages, so, I need a generic way to do this that will work whenever the path changes, nix uses new hashes for unique identities for packages.
 Thanks in advance for the help.

 Basically, I wanted ibuffer &amp; projectile to generate a list of projects on startup that I could combine with my own list of filters so that stuff inside a project gets grouped together, and all the stuff not in a project is grouped in ways that&#x27;s useful to me instead of all just ending up under Default.
 Oh, and before I share the code I should say that I am by no means a lisp or elisp expert; this is just the result of an afternoon&#x27;s worth of hacking on lisp to try and get it to do what I want.

I can get completion after pyright --createstubs pandas within the project, but I miss the global pyright completion just like lsp-pyright. How could I fix it?

 Some months ago I read the excellent article &quot;Avy can do anything (https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/), which changed the way I use Avy and Emacs in general. The article basically explains what are Avy actions and how to create new ones. This got me inspired to create my own Avy actions, which I&#x27;d like to share with the community in the form of a literate config.
 The shared config, extends some notions and creates new ones (some left as a kind-of challenge in the mentioned article):
 ​
 - Region actions: actions that act in an arbitrary not visible region created with avy selections (copy, yank, kill, teleport). First you mark the initial point of the region with an action, then you execute a region action on the other end of the region.
 - Quick char commands: skip the initial filtering step of an Avy command pre-filtering a character. For example I use this in emacs-lisp mode to auto filter open parenthesis with a key binding, this is very useful as actions act on Sexp.
 - Auto actions: enable the automatic execution of an avy action on a selected candidate
 - Compound actions and commands: link several avy interactions in a single command or action using auto actions. This is useful for example for region actions, instead of executing two Avy commands to first mark the start of the region with a command and then select and act on the end of the region; you only execute a command that integrates two Avy interactions, the first one auto applies the mark action, then you select the action and element at the end of the region. I also use this for creating a replace action, combining kill and yank actions in one action.
 ​
 I hope this results useful for someone.

                              <span>Hi there,
 After jumping into org-roam rabbit holes few month ago, i&#x27;m now starting using org-mode to manage my system ansible playbook. Actually i&#x27;m surprised, i search on different places on the net and i don&#x27;t found lot of devops style tangled org-mode ansible playbook.
 If you have some repository / dotfile online with playbook examples made with org (devops style), i&#x27;m interested.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have a pretty basic need to view the stdout of this process (i.e. view numbers from 1 to 10 printed out to an external buffer, much like async-shell-command), not only the final result.
 Is this feasible to do this? If this were feasible it would be convenient to view the process of my long-running command. And I can totally live free from the terminal.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a program that transcodes financial statements into a ledger. In that program I have types representing different activities:
 haskell data Withdrawal &#x3D; Withdrawal { wTarget :: !Text, wAmount :: !Cash, wBalance :: !Cash } data Fee &#x3D; { fFee :: !Cash, fBalance :: !Cash } -- many more 
 I use those types, because I have functions that are transaction-type specific.
 I also wanted to write an activity parser that translates CSV records into those types, so I created an Activity sum type:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Activity &#x3D; ActivityFee Fee | ActivityWithdrawal Withdrawal | -- ...
 parseActivity :: CsvRecord -&gt; Activity &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 That Activity is quite boilerplate&#x27;y. Having to have a new Activity* constructor for a new activity type is slightly cumbersome.
 Is there a more idiomatic or better design pattern for this problem? Was it C++, std::variant would be convenient, because adding a new activity type wouldn&#x27;t entail adding a new boilerplate constructor.
 I&#x27;ve considered type-classes, but the problem with them is that they are not closed and I can&#x27;t pattern match to create a function like applyActivity :: Activity -&gt; Wallet -&gt; Wallet. I see that I could make applyActivity into a function of an Activity class, but then problem is that this solution is only straightforward if only one argument is using this pattern. If we had two arguments like foo :: (ClassOne a, ClassTwo b) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c, then it&#x27;s not clear to which class foo should belong.

 I&#x27;m trying to teach someone what a function is conceptually beyond just (a -&gt; b), so that they can recognize it when they see it in any context, regardless of language. I have been trying to come up with a type, or a diagram, to explain it.
 The essential pieces I see for a function are a parameter assignment, a computation, and a return. The type at the top is meant to capture these and the diagram for this would be a square.
 I also think that this can be used to define an arrow, except the first argument would be an identity on the input, the second the arrow, and the third argument would be an identity on the output.
 This is how I sketch functions and arrows when I imagine them but I don&#x27;t know if anyone else&#x27;s imagination agrees.

                              <span>Org-view-mode is now available for installation from Melpa. 
 Since my last post in this Reddit, it has got some new features, of which probably the most interesting is to remove read-only status, but still keep org markup hidden. It is meant for simple edits like fix a spelling mistake or add/remove a word or two. For bigger edits, drop back into org-mode. There are some other minor additions, hiding some agenda keywords and ellipses. The last one is not really recommended, but it can be useful only in some very special cases.
 For the usage info, check the README file in the Github repository.

                              <span>Dear community,
 I&#x27;m looking for a comparison of the various note-taking-packages implementing the Zettelkasten-method. I don&#x27;t want to build a second brain or create a personal wiki, instead I want to capture and link ideas for researching and writing.
 Using org, I&#x27;m naturally drawn to org-roam, however, I dislike the bulk of dependencies and its complexity stemming. Furthermore, I dislike, that I can&#x27;t get a textual overview of a subset of notes belonging together (using a webserver-solution like org-roam-ui is not what I want here). Looking at the new zk-package, I want to note that I like its simple and clean approach, but I dislike, certain design decisions, like using spaces in file names and the fact, that it doesn&#x27;t integrate deeply in the org-ecosystem, e.g. not utilizizing org-IDs. The last point is the biggest downside imho. While one could hack on the codebase to change this, another drawback seems to be that it is not really mature and doesn&#x27;t seem to have a large userbase. 
 Currently, I&#x27;m try out both of these very different options, but I can&#x27;t really decide for on or the other, since both have different strengths and downsides. Therefore, I want ask for your opinions and experience with implementing the Zettelkasten-method (or a personalized derivation of it). Which horse should I put?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have come to the conclusion that despite its excellent keystroke and plug-in customizations, vim still requires a lot of work to get simple development tools working inside of it. 
 Anyway, are there any good starting resources to help me learn more about emacs and also smoothen my transition?
 What have I tried so far? - emacs tutorial - have looked at evil, but haven’t tried it. Is it good?
 Any other help is welcome. Also, you can delete this if it is a repost. 
 Thanks!

It would make more sense to open as an (extended) minibuffer instead. I looked at the documentation but haven&#x27;t found a setting.

 After a recent update(?), this function no longer works. I have tried taking SVG out of the list of inline image formats in ox-html, but it just inlines the file with a tags. The transclusion of the full source is not happening.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I use ivy-postframe and it works great 99% of the time. There is an issue, however, when I have two windows side-by-side in i3-gaps and open a search (for example for a file). When I start typing, emacs for some reason starts putting what I type at the beginning of the line _ (1/79) Find file: ~/ instead of the end of the line. This is super annoying. The issue goes away if I put emacs on full screen mode.
 Does anyone know of a solution or why this is happening?

 If you feel like reading text books (TEXT format) like those available via Project Gutenberg, Emacs can be a good tool. https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2022/02/text-books-in-emacs.html

                              <span>EDIT: THIS HAS BEEN ANSWERED, THANKS!
 I&#x27;m a newbie. From: https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html
 It says the following:
 You must insert a comma right before lines starting with either ‘*’, ‘,*’, ‘#+’ or ‘,#+’ 
 Is this a mistake in the text? Why would I need to put a comma before a line starting with ,*? I&#x27;d end up with ,,*.
 Then they give the following example:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ,* I am no real headline #+END_EXAMPLE 
 But wouldn&#x27;t it be sufficient without the begin end?
 ;; This will work too ,* I am no real headline 
 For that matter, wouldn&#x27;t it be sufficient to have just about any character there, including a space? 
 ;; This will work too * I am no real headline 
 EDIT: It just occurred to me that I&#x27;m thinking mainly in terms of how emacs is parsing and presenting the information within the editor as I type, but there might be other issues with the system processing the text, such as for agendas, exporting, etc.

                              <span>Hi there,
 This is a screen shot from part of my FastMail IMAP email inbox in Mu4e.
 Lots of inbox email headers, each crossed out, but still listed in the inbox.
 All of these emails have been archived or moved via the MacOS Mail program, or iOS Mail app but they show up like this here, which means that they have been trashed from Mu4e&#x27;s perspective.
 I&#x27;m trying to work out how to make my Mu4e display consistent with what iPhone or Mac Mail shows me. I.E. If I archive an email in iOS Mail, the reference to it is no longer displayed in Mu4e so that I don&#x27;t have to do everything twice.
 I have followed this setup pretty much exactly but applied to FastMail.
 Can somebody point in the right direction please?
 ​
 (Edited to make my request clearer, and to try replacing the image that seemed to be stuck &quot;processing...&quot;.)

 I&#x27;m trying to get started with Reflex/Obelisk as we have a few quite simple UI use-cases that would benefit highly from sharing code between the front-end and back-end.
 However, struggling to get one thing working - HLS.
 Setting up an Obelisk project was actually remarkably easy.
 ob shell, ob run and ob watch work perfectly.
 However, when I open up VS code from within the nix-shell hls is failing with some very weird errors.
  Unexpected usage error can&#x27;t load .so/.DLL for: /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version &#x60;GLIBC_2.29&#x27; not found (required by /nix/store/jc9zqp241vz5ziwh0smls0sl1sf6h7np-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so)) typecheck 
 I assume this is because it&#x27;s reaching for my local installation of haskell-language-server (it&#x27;s pointed to the 8.6.5 version, so that&#x27;s not the issue), but absolutely no idea how to approach this.
 Is there some working repository example or a tutorial for IDE integration that doesn&#x27;t require you to know Nix in order to make any sense of it?

                              <span>I am interested to get Haskell onto PowerPC. From what I understand the last version existing as ready-made binary is 6.10.x. Is it possible to build recent GHC for ppc somehow?
 I have gcc11 working on ppc, latest cmake and most of other tools. (What does not work on ppc is clang.)
 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Ideally I wanna get GHC for ppc into Macports, but if I manage to build it locally, I can open a PR.
 UPD. In fact, there is a binary on GHC 7.0.1 for PowerPC: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_0_1.html#macosxppc

 Or should I use the TeXstudio Editor instead? Thank you.

                              <span>So, I am back with my persistent request to you fellow Scala users to &quot;Star&quot; some projects on Github.
 Why ? 
 Because the &quot;Github Stars&quot; have somehow evolved into the easiest available indicator of popularity and trustworthyness of a project.
 And yes, I know that &quot;Github Stars&quot; are not really a good indicator of quality and trust. And they were just meant to be like a bookmark.
 But probably even the Github guys did not foresee the open-source explosion which took place in last 5-6 years and Github became the de-facto home for opensource community. With the rise of &quot;the like/subscribe culture&quot; of Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn during these times, our community was also craving for that &quot;like/follow/subscribe&quot; button, and they found the &quot;Star button&quot;.
 Yes, it is a bad indicator but an indicator none the less.
 ​
 So, please take few seconds of your time to hit that &quot;like/follow/subscribe&quot;. It might just help in giving outsiders more confidence in our excellant ecosystem.

                              <span>Hi,
 I think Persistent-odbc is the only version that can work with MSSQL, but persistent-odbc doesn&#x27;t pair with newer versions of Persistent as Persistent updated its datatypes. I thought selda was neat, but its DB language metatypes (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the right name) are in a closed data type rather than an open typeclass declaration. MSSQL has many database column types so having type class declarations of the translation DB language metatype would allow for more flexibility for the ORM to handle multiple databases.
 I&#x27;m going to try to rewrite selda&#x27;s types to handle extensible column definitions.

                              <span>Hi, I was reading through Category Theory for Programmers, and I was wondering if the monadic bind &gt;&gt;&#x3D; :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b can be defined in terms of the kleisli arrows: &gt;&#x3D;&gt; :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c) . After a bit, I came up with:  (&gt;&#x3D;&gt;) :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c) (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b ma &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; ((\_ -&gt; ma) &gt;&#x3D;&gt; f) id -- apply to it a junk value 
 Since the result of applying &gt;&#x3D;&gt; returns a function, I need to call the function with a junk value to make it return just m b . Was I correct in my approach? Thank you.

                              <span>I am trying to implement a BST in Haskell, but I can&#x27;t figure out how lists work in Haskell. So the algorithm would add a node and for each node two empty lists that denote it&#x27;s two subtrees. However, I am stuck at initializing a BST in the first place. So when I insert a number into an empty BST:
 insert 5 [] 
 it would return a list like so:
 [5, [], []] 
 This is what I have:
 insert x lis &#x3D; if null lis then [x, [], []] else undefined --for now 
 I thought the function declaration would have to be:
 insert :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer] 
 But that doesn&#x27;t work. If you know how to solve this, I would also appreciate reference material where these things are covered. I am struggling to find relevant documentation.

                              <span>I know stack doesn&#x27;t love M1 macs, but it seems to work fine as long as I run it in a Rosetta terminal with the --arch x86_64 flag.
 Today, though, I&#x27;m trying to install the yesod bin following the Yesod quickstart guide, and not having any luck. (I&#x27;m in a Rosetta terminal and adding --arch x86_64 to stack commands.)
 The error occurs at the step of installing the yesod command line tool (step 3); this fails with:
 : can&#x27;t load framework: Cocoa (not found) 
 Is it even possible to work with the yesod command line tool on an M1? If so, am I just making some boneheaded mistake?
 EDIT: Problem kinda solved! See comment for what I did.

In addition to the part included in the example, I found this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38184/org-mode-ignore-heading-when-exporting-to-latex and added this to my config: (require &#x27;ox-extra) (ox-extras-activate &#x27;(ignore-headlines)) and I added titletoc to my default packages as well. This indicates ‏‏‎ that titletoc has to be included before the hyperref package. This is what my packages setup looks like: (setq org-latex-default-packages-alist &#x27;((&quot;rm&quot; &quot;roboto&quot; t) (&quot;defaultsans&quot; &quot;lato&quot; t) (&quot;&quot; &quot;paracol&quot; t) (&quot;&quot; &quot;titletoc&quot; t))) There&#x27;s no reference to the hyperref package anywhere in the file, but the output file indicates that package hyperref has indeed been loaded. Could the issue be that titletoc is not loading before hyperref, and if so, how can I make it do that? If that is not the issue, any ideas on what troubleshooting I can try next? Thanks all!

                              <span>Hello everybody! I wrote my first emacs extension: csharpto.el
 Basically it introduces Evil text objects for functions (and now generic &quot;scopes&quot;) of the CSharp language. They still don&#x27;t support the count argument and the current region, but they work fine for the trivial cases and are already saving me lots of keystrokes. Hope they are useful to someone else!
 Oh, and as I was learning and doing at the same time, I&#x27;m pretty sure lots of things can be improved. I&#x27;m open for your feedback and suggestions! Thanks.
 A bit of background
 About 2.5y ago I was using C# and Visual Studio at work, and after playing around with Vim for a few months I got to know this Evil mode thing and decided to give Emacs a try (or more specifically, Spacemacs). Since then, I&#x27;ve been learning how to, and using …</span>

 (use-package vertico :straight t :custom (vertico-resize nil) (vertico-cycle t) :init (vertico-mode) :config (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/vertico/extensions&quot;) (require &#x27;vertico-mouse) (vertico-mouse-mode) ) 
 Note that vertico-mouse-mode isn&#x27;t available in vertico.el, but requires vertico-mouse.el.
 I&#x27;m using straight.el (btw), so I don&#x27;t like at all the require statement here. Is there any other way I could load the package?

                              <span>This is a general question but my specific problem is actually a Rust related one. 
 By default rustic mode provides a function rustic-cargo-run which calls cargo run without any arguments. I am testing a CLI I created and would like to provide arguments to my run command. I found a function called rustic-run-cargo-command, which has this as it&#x27;s description: &quot;Start compilation process for &#x27;cargo run&#x27; with optional RUN-ARGS&quot;. 
 But i cannot seem to find a way to provide these optional arguments. Can anyone guide me on this issue? For example If I want to run &#x27;cargo run -n test&#x27;, I would try calling M-x rustic-run-cargo-command -n test but this will not work. 
 The function definition can be found here.
 Thank you for your help.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m finally starting to consider learning eLisp in a more structured way than I&#x27;ve done before (which was copying &amp; pasting snippets from the web, then guesstimating the syntax from there to get done what I&#x27;m looking for).
 I tried Udemy, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything useful on there.
 I am rather limited in terms of free time, having young children and a busy career.
 Can someone on here please recommend a way for me to make progress with learning eLisp from nearly scratch?
 I have a few years of Java experience, so am well familiar with basic concepts.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pycharm/visual studio user, but recently vim caught my eye. While figuring out of vim was what I wanted I kept seeing these &quot;vim vs emacs&quot; yt videos and articles, which got me to check out emacs, which at the time looked very similar to vim (to my &quot;mouse focused gui&quot;-using eyes). After some digging i found distro tubes video on doom emacs which really sold me, but here&#x27;s the issue: although it&#x27;s relatively easy to find content telling you why to use emacs, there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any content telling you how to use emacs. 
 I really feel like I&#x27;ve walked into a car showroom, been shown this cool, futuristic car with no visible doors or windows. But as soon as I said &quot;cool, how do I get into it, so I can test drive it?&quot; The salesman just started starting blankly at me as if I&#x27;m the weirdo for not already knowing. 
 This post was mainly to express my woes, but I am very open to being directed to resources on how to get started, especially seeing it up for c# and python.

                              <span>Hey there,
 So Command + V in iTerm2 is the paste action.
 However, I tried looking in the settings but am unaware of how to remap the default paste option since I swap a few keys on my Emacs setup on MacOS.
 Related swaps:
 Caps --&gt; Control
 Option --&gt; Control
 Is it possible to nuke the default Command + V &#x27;paste&#x27; keybinding in iTerm2 for Emacs?
 This interferes with normal Emacs keybindings since Command + V on my setup on normal Emacs on MacOS usually advances the screen by 1 screenful.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m writing some functionality in elisp which only works when I step through the expressions using Edebug and &quot;space&quot; but it fails when running in a regular manner. I know where the script fails in terms of a specific line, I just don&#x27;t know of a mechanism in which the outcome is different due to stepping vs. regular run. Here is the code:
 (defun df/cite () (interactive) (defvar df/cite-title &quot;&quot;) (defvar df/cite-buffer (current-buffer)) (org-ref-insert-cite-link) (org-ref-open-citation-at-point) (setq df/cite-title (bibtex-autokey-get-field &quot;title&quot; bibtex-autokey-titleword-change-strings)) (switch-to-buffer df/cite-buffer) (end-of-visual-line) (backward-char) (insert (format &quot;[%s]&quot; df/cite-title)) (end-of-visual-line)) 
 The code lets you insert an org-ref citation and uses the article&#x27;s title (from the bibtex) entry as the org link description. The script works line by line in edebug but fails as a whole on the line running &quot;open-citation-at-point&quot;. Not sure why.

                              <span>I would like a way to shorten/abbreviate filenames in the Emacs mini-buffer when copying/moving files in Dired. For e.g. if I mark a file in Dired to be moved, its name appears in the minibuffer asking me to choose a destination. The filename is sometimes long and I have to press the up arrow several times. I would like to shorten it so that the name all fits on one line.

                              <span>Currently, I got python/jupyter working nicely in emacs with Emacs-Ipython-Notebook and Elpy(things like matplotlib render nicely in emacs/ein), but 1 thing that I haven&#x27;t figured out yet, is does emacs/ein currently suppport pywidgets/ipythonwidgets(browser widgets)? I can get ipywidgets to run, but instead of it displaying a browser widget in emacs/ein, it only displays a variable&#x3D;value of the widget hat I&#x27;m trying to render?
 Any tips to fix this browser widget issue in emacs/emacs-ipython-notbook(or jupyter-emacs as well)?
  
I&#x27;m very happy with using emacs-ipython-notebook and and jupyter-emacs in emacs, but, the last thing that I need to get working is browser widgets, then I should be good to go with python/jupyter projects in emacs.

                              <span>Magit has a philosophy of making everything explorable. You don&#x27;t just see a diff; you can jump to the file from the diff. You don&#x27;t just see filenames; you can jump to the file from the name. The view is transformable. Etc, etc.
 I learned today about running grep from within emacs. I tried it out, and the results were spoiled by the inclusion of files from my mypy folder, which aren&#x27;t of interest. I could modify the grep command to excplude that folder, but I&#x27;m lazy. I&#x27;d prefer to be able to click on the output and say &quot;hide this and anything else from the same folder&quot;.
 I&#x27;d also like to be able to interactively toggle the -h option, to hide the filenames on the left side.
 Is this possible? I see that I can jump to the file, and the line in question, which is great. Other than that, though, the output does not seem to be very interactive.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>When testing the basic functionality of my actors, my receiveMessage() event on my test probe is timing out, because the probe isn&#x27;t listening for messages on the actor that I&#x27;ve spawned.
 ​
 For some context, I have 2 actors
  
A TaskManager actor
 A Session actor
  
My TaskManager actor has 2 commands:
  
CreateSession(id) - This spawns a new Session actor
 SessionCreated(id, ref) - When a Session actor is spawned, it sends the SessionCreated message back to the TaskManager so that I can store the ref of the session (and perform other stuff)
  
Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m running into the issue. I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to write a test to listen for messages coming back to the TaskManager actor that I spawned. When running the test, it times out waiting for the receiveMessage() event.
 Here&#x27;s my test code:
  &quot;Task Manager&quot; must { &quot;be able to create sessions and receive a reply from the session when its created&quot; in { val taskManager &#x3D; spawn(TaskManager()) val sessionProbe &#x3D; createTestProbe[SessionCreated]() taskManager ! CreateSession(&quot;session1&quot;) val reply &#x3D; sessionProbe.receiveMessage() // ^^ times out } } 
 I&#x27;ve been searching the docs and Googling everywhere, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation on how to listen for a message that should come back to an Actor that was spawned in the test.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried adding a new parameter to the CreateSession message to supply the probe ref, but then the probe receives the message instead of the taskManager actor, and thus the taskManager won&#x27;t complete the changes that I need to test subsequently. I do know that the taskManager value does have a ref, but it doesn&#x27;t have a receiveMessage method, so I&#x27;m stumped here.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated! Sorry for the noob question :-)

 doom-lighttable-theme
 I created a theme for Doom based on the default Lighttable theme
  
Grab a copy from here
 Copy the theme file to ~/.doom.d/themes/doom-lighttable-theme.el
 Update your ~/.doom.d/config.el with: (setq doom-theme &#x27;doom-lighttable)
 reload.
  
It is still a WIP but I use it every day with no issues. I plan on creating a merge request to the main doom themes repo once I find time. Any feedback would be cool :)

 In short, I&#x27;d like the function to do this: whenever I switch buffers, Emacs runs this function which should take the underlying filename of the buffer, open an org file arranged as a datetree, create a (or go to an already existing) heading based on the filename, and clock in. If that heading is the currently-clocked item, don&#x27;t clock out and in again. Use the top-level directory name of the project as the file tag (for later filtering).
 This seems to work if I&#x27;ve already opened the org file and org-mode has been run. It fails on the first run when opening Emacs (beca…</span>

 Prettify-symbols enabled

 I am using following code to make org- tables collapsible. Works great appart from styling - in hidden state tables occupies 2 lines with 3 dots below:
 #+NAME: mytbl ... 
 How to make dots appear one same line right after table name?

                              <span>Hi,
 I use Debian 11 with KDE. So far, I was on KDE X11 and I ran the emacs daemon as a service (debian configures this for you ootb, so you simply need to enable it).
 However, I moved to a KDE wayland setup today, and I cannot launch the client after boot. I think it is launching before wayland can set things up (I have no idea what that means though...).
 journalctl --user -u emacs.service | tail -n 10 gives me
 Feb 17 15:39:39 xxx emacs[1302]: Loaded /home/x/.emacs.d/config/settings.el Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode... Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done (0.330s, 90 buffers checked) Feb 17 15:39:40 xxx emacs[1302]: Starting Emacs daemon. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: Started Emacs text editor. Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx emacs[1302]: Package cl is deprecated Feb 17 15:39:41 xxx systemd[1282]: emacs.service: Got notification message from PID 3258, but reception only permitted for main PID 1302 Feb 17 15:41:51 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified Feb 17 15:45:53 xxx emacs[1302]: No protocol specified 
 So I am guessing the daemon loads properly and then encounters some problems after the Package cl is deprecated message. If I try to run the client with emacsclient -c I get
 Waiting for Emacs... *ERROR*: Display :1 can’t be opened 
 Which is very strange since systemctl status --user emacs.service shows that the service is indeed active. Any help/suggestions/comments?
 Cheers

                              <span>When I enter a long sequence of numbers into the main calc-mode window, the most recent number is cut off, so that I only see the very top of its line. When I process all of those numbers, the *Calc Trail* buffer doesn&#x27;t scroll down automatically, so I have to do it to see what my most recent calculations were.
 Demonstration: https://gfycat.com/windingcanineivorybackedwoodswallow 
 For reference, here&#x27;s what I do in the GIF:
  
Input the numbers 1 - 0
 Sum them all
 Scroll the *Calc Trail* buffer, then do M-S-&gt;
 Repeat the same process another time
  
I really enjoy calc-mode, but it&#x27;s frustrating to use for long equations due to this. Anyone have similar issues?

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering getting a new keyboard and don&#x27;t know which one to buy. ATM I&#x27;m using my regular keyboard with kmonad to evaluate home row mods, and I find it suiting and comfortable. 
 Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for a new keyboard and I sort of settled on the Moonlander or Planck. Moonlander is a full fledged ergonomic keyboard and Planck is a smaller (40%) keyboard. I will often have the keyboard with me as I&#x27;m working at home and a couple of different locations at work, therefore the small planck is tempting. Anyone that uses Planck with Emacs? Will it be better to buy a larger ergonomic keyboard? 
 Any input will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Ok, due to the latest Arch update of latest gcc &amp; gcc-libs (they package it so), libgccjit was broken. I had to uninstall it so I could upgrade rest of the system, and my Emacs didn&#x27;t start due to missing libgccjit.so. So I quickly recompiled Emacs without native compiler, and surprise. I don&#x27;t even miss native compiler. 
 I used to see a difference in Helm and some other places like a year ago when native comp was in its early stages. I don&#x27;t have benchmarks, but my Emacs seems like even smoother without native comp for some reason. There are no hiccups, no waiting for completions to pop up. What happened? I run current master, re-compiled like 2 days ago.
 I now even wonder if I will enable native comp again. Is it just me, or do other people experience similar?

 I&#x27;ve global-visual-line-mode 1 in my init.el which works everywhere except in eww buffers :/
 I currently manually run toggle-truncate-lines in eww buffers in order to wrap the long lines.
 Anyone knows how to set eww-mode buffers to auto wrap the long lines?

                              <span>Quick question, I recently started using lsp-mode with ccls as a language server and my buffers are cluttered with a counter for each variable showing how many time it&#x27;s referenced in the code base.
 Is there a way to disable it? they&#x27;re a bit annoying as every time I delete a line they don&#x27;t go away instantly and clutter the buffer for a couple of seconds making it almost unusable.
 Screenshot for reference.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Preamble
  
I&#x27;ve tried google, but I don&#x27;t know/understand emacs terms enough to know what to search. 
 I&#x27;m not asking for a config, or &quot;edit some-variable-name&quot; I want to learn and the best way for me is by doing
 I&#x27;m a prose writer and have converted my markdown novel into org.
 The meat
  
Since I don&#x27;t use text editors for code, I&#x27;d like to have emacs &quot;know&quot; to use helvetica when I open an *.org file. I&#x27;d done something similar in vim where markdown files would word wrap at 100 characters and a few other things I&#x27;ve since forgotten. (I haven&#x27;t written in over a year and it&#x27;s been longer than that since I edited init.vim
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with prelude-emacs … distro? I&#x27;d like to use vanilla emacs but add whatever package pops up a mini-buffer? With hints after chording C-c or M-x
 TLDR
  
What variable should I look at to have org mode use helvetica font? What package gives hints after typing C-c , M-x etc

                              <span>First, Install OpenBangla for your distro following the official guide. (OpenBanlga include avro and many more feature.)
 Next, configure the input method for your Window Manager according to the guide above. After you do that, you can now change input method using s+SPACE So now you can have a workflow.
 - Go to emacs
 - Open a file and type some bangla texts.
 - If you need to type commands, do s+SPACE to move back to English.
 Its fairly obvious but I thought it might be helpful for some beginners who searched for similar feature, like me. And also, its not nearly as seamless as M-x set-input-method bengali-itrans which automatically handles all of these for you and gives you an amazing writing experience. Sadly, it does not yet provide avro-style input-method and the existing itrans,probhat are really unorthodox input method that very few uses and hard to master. I hope someday I will have enough knowledge to contribute that.

                              <span>I know plenty of people come to emacs from Vim, so it makes sense to use evil, spacemacs, etc, but I rarely if ever see the other way around. I&#x27;ve been doing vanilla emacs for a bit, and while I&#x27;m used to it, I definitely don&#x27;t love the navigation shortcuts, and I&#x27;ve always been very interested in how Vim works.
 Anyone here was already used to and comfortable with regular emacs bindings and decided to learn Vim keybindings?
 Did you think it was worth it? Did you keep it or went back to vanilla emacs? Do you use it only in certain contexts? Any tips for how to pursue it?

                              <span>I started using orgmode two months ago after I learnt about it from videos from thoughtbot. Never having used emacs before and not knowing lisp it took me while to ramp up on it. I found the way you can have neatly nested lists and have math equations quite nice. I set up org roam as well . Everything on doom emacs. But after 2 months of using it I find myself in a situation where it has turned out to be not all I expected it to be. * The org roam promise of becoming a second brain didn&#x27;t really work for me. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly but having backlink info in the buffer I didn&#x27;t find that useful. It&#x27;s not easy to find things unless you remember the name or keywords in the title.
  
Writing long documents feels clunky in orgmode. Maybe it&#x27;s more adapted to short todos. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it
 
Export options : I can export to pdf but the output often doesn&#x27;t look good with the weird section numbering. Having nested items looks good inside orgmode but not in an exported pdf. There&#x27;s no option to export to doc that I&#x27;m aware of. It makes collaboration with others difficult
 
It doesn&#x27;t work well with tools my team uses with slack and google docs. 
 
And many others
 
 Has anyone else felt like this? What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;m planning to go back to vs code and mark down files because emacs looks like a big investment. But I really like the idea of a macro enabled editor.
 Edit: I didn&#x27;t expect such useful and positive feedback from everyone. You guys are the best. I found some promising stuff . I&#x27;m going to give it another try. Thanks!

 I am using following code to make org- tables collapsible. Works great appart from styling - in hidden state tables occupies 2 lines with 3 dots below:
 #+NAME: mytbl ... 
 How to make dots appear one same line right after table name?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement a Convolutional Neural Network in Haskell. I have previously built a normal artificial network using hmatrix for linear algebra operations (BLAS, etc.) but now that I need to do convolutions, I have to somehow parallelise my code. I looked into the obvious packages for parallel arrays such as repa arrays and the accelerate package. accelerate is an embedded DSL which I think would make the code quite unelegant and I want to stay as close to Haskell as possible. Further, I am working on a Windows PC with a CUDA capable GPU but also a MacBook Pro 2021 so I&#x27;d have to implement both accelerate and some other package for non-CUDA PCs as well.
 So that brings me to Repa, which seems perfect for my purposes:

 I would much appreciate some help. Haskell is acting really weird with infinite lists and I would like to figure out, what is happening.
 So, I have a type BitString, which is a wrapper around Data.ByteString.Lazy and allows me to construct a bytestring from single bits. It works fine, but I would like to be able to work with infinite bitstrings.
 Here is part of the code relevant to this problem:
 import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Internals as BLI data BitString &#x3D; BitString Word8 Word8 BL.ByteString -- head, size of the head, tail #define EMPTY (BitString 0 0 BLI.Empty) -- for simpler pattern matching empty :: BitString empty &#x3D; EMPTY cons :: Word8 -&gt; BitString -&gt; BitString cons b (BitString h l t) | l &#x3D;&#x3D; 7 &#x3D; BitString 0 0 (push…</span>

                              <span>I was quite excited to discover how to use The Archive in two windows properly. I&quot;m sure many people here know this, but I thought I&#x27;d share it here as it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me at first.
If you open a new window (from the Window menu), it opens a second copy of The Archive. Normally, this window operates independently of the first window.
But what I hadn&#x27;t realized is that, if you have the second window open and highlighted, you can right click on links in the (unhighlighted) first window. If you hover over a link, right click and select Open Link in that window, it leaves the first window on its current page, and opens the link in the second window. Very cool. This is really useful for copying material between documents that are part of the same &quot;tree&quot; of documents, without losing your place or leaving the current document.</span>

                              <span>This feature request might be considered esoteric, but oh well.
MultiMarkdown Composer has a feature called elastic tabstops which allows indented text to be correctly aligned even when using a proportional font:

  
Rather than assigning a fixed number of spaces to a tab character, or a fixed width, tabs represent “columns” of text. Contiguous lines of text are examined to ensure that the columns are wide enough to contain the text in each line.


Why does it matter? My theme uses a monospaced font for all markdown syntax (-, *, &gt;, etc.), but a proportional font for everything else. (I stole this idea from the brillant folks at Cultured Code.) As it right now however, when mixing proportional and monospaced fonts, The Archive doesn&#x27;t align lists correctly.</span>

                              <span>This feature request might be considered esoteric, but oh well.
MultiMarkdown Composer has a feature called elastic tabstops which allows indented text to be correctly aligned even when using a proportional font:

  
Rather than assigning a fixed number of spaces to a tab character, or a fixed width, tabs represent “columns” of text. Contiguous lines of text are examined to ensure that the columns are wide enough to contain the text in each line.


Why does it matter? My theme uses a monospaced font for all markdown syntax (-, *, &gt;, etc.), but a proportional font for everything else. (I stole this idea from the brillant folks at Cultured Code.) As it right now however, when mixing proportional and monospaced fonts, The Archive doesn&#x27;t align lists correctly.</span>

 The relevant directories exist, some aspects have been changed to protect the identities of those involved :) Any help would be much appreciated. (If parens don&#x27;t match here, it&#x27;s because of bad copy-pasta, not because that&#x27;s how it is in my config -- I&#x27;ve checked for paren-matching in the actual config)

                              <span>I am trying to write a function for a org-capture template that uses on the value of a template expansion. So for example, when reading emails, depending on the %:from value, the string used in the template is different. The only way I found it to work was to do something like this:
  (&quot;mt&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (file+olp &quot;~/org/todos.org&quot; &quot;My todos&quot;) &quot;%(custom/task-email \&quot;%:from\&quot; \&quot;%:subject\&quot;)&quot; :empty-lines 1) 
 Is it possible to use the value %:from within the custom/task-email? I just want to avoid having multiple lines with \&quot;%:from\&quot; \&quot;%:subject\&quot;
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey @all,
 TL;DR: Would appreciate some feedback about my WIP Emacs theme. Link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Last week I finally had the time to do one thing that was on my bucket list for quite some time: Write my own Emacs color theme.
 It is not available on MELPA yet, because I first wanted to ask some fellow Emacs users about their opinion. So far, the one person that also uses Emacs and I know irl thinks it is quite pleasant. But I would appreciate a bit more feedback, so here I am.
 It is still a WIP so every feedback is very welcome (: For now, I only included packages I use on a regular basis, but I&#x27;ll try to slowly but surely add dedicated support for more packages (requests welcome). Most of the other packages I know have sane inheritance and could still be usable right now. I am by far not an elisp-pro but I tried my best to provide a dark and a light version without too much duplicate code.
 If you wanna check it out, here is the link: https://github.com/qhga/shanty-theme
 Thanks &lt;3

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get GNUS to show article fullscreen after select on summary screen. I found out about gnus-buffer-configuration variable where is configuration of how screen should by displayed. I also found gnus-add-configuration function to modify. I tried to set article settings to:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0 point))) 
 But when I try to open article I get gnus-summary-show-thread: Args out of range: 0 and empty buffer is open in fullscreen. I also tried without point:
 (article (vertical 1.0 (article 1.0))) 
 since I got same error when I tried to reset to default and I forgot to delete points from behind the article:
 (gnus-add-configuration &#x27;(article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point) (article 1.0 point)))) 
 I also tried to get (summary 0) but that was some other error and I thing it also does not make much sense.
 Anybody tried similar thing? How to setup GNUS to open article fullscreen?
 EDIT: I tried to debug gnus a little bit and I find out that responsible function for shoving thread is gnus-summary-show-thread, but can&#x27;t understand what exactly it is doing, from mi point of view I see only some tinkering with cursor position and something called overlays:
 (defun gnus-summary-show-thread () &quot;Show thread subtrees. Returns nil if no thread was there to be shown.&quot; (interactive nil gnus-summary-mode) (let* ((orig (point)) (end (point-at-eol)) (end (or (gnus-summary--inv end) (gnus-summary--inv (1- end)))) ;; Leave point at bol (beg (progn (beginning-of-line) (if (bobp) (point) (1- (point))))) (eoi (and end (next-single-char-property-change end &#x27;invisible)))) (when eoi (remove-overlays beg eoi &#x27;invisible &#x27;gnus-sum) (goto-char orig) (gnus-summary-position-point) eoi)))

                              <span>That&#x27;s a bit of a strange post, but I hope it may spark some positive discussion: Emacs recently get tab support. First AFAIK from Centaur Emacs and then upstream. Tabs are common UI elements since years, however IMVHO in most cases are a very bad idea as they are normally: modern monitor are 16:9 and most people use them straight, not 90° rotated, so plenty of horizontal space, very little vertical one and tabs eat some of it while still being unable to scale well...
 On contrary &quot;experiments&quot; like Tab Center Redux (it&#x27;s successor Tab Center Reborn) Firefox extension show that vertical tabs can scale well, they might be &quot;hard to choose&quot; at first, but actually work pretty well. They remain easy to read even when they are many, they might be scrollable if needed, integrated with switch-buffer search&amp;narrow packages, they might co-exist with a sidebar (like those popular in IDEs), even on one and another side of the screen and potentially spark new UI ideas to extend them further. 
 What do you think about that?

                              <span>When I view PDFs in Emacs using DocView, they appear much darker than they should:
 ​
 Emacs and Preview displaying the same PDF, where it is much darker in Emacs
 I am not sure why this happens -- I haven&#x27;t changed any settings related to DocView or enabled any minor modes that would cause this. Disabling my current emacs config (by moving .emacs.d) does not resolve this. I am using the mituharu emacs-mac port from this Homebrew formula, but the issue also exists with the build from https://emacsformacosx.com. My .emacs.d is on GitHub here.
 Has anyone encountered a similar issue before? How would I go about resolving this?
 UPDATE:
 I found out that the issue is caused by GhostScript, as expressed in this comment. I&#x27;ve resolved it by installing mupdf (brew install mupdf), which should cause docview to use mudraw to convert PDFs to temporary PNGs instead of GhostScript. After installing mupdf, opening a PDF in DocView and running doc-view-clear-cache should resolve the issue.

                              <span>I hope one of you fine folk can help. I&#x27;m trying to set up mu4e and integrate it with my org-mode based GTD system.
 I already have org capture templates set up to make next action entries.
 What I want to do now, is make the next action entry have a link to the email that the action is about (i.e. the one I was reading when I invoked the capture template)... but if I invoke the capture template from someplace other than an email, I don&#x27;t want there to be a link in it.
 So if I&#x27;m in an email, I want C-c c a w to open this template:
 (&quot;aw&quot; &quot;Work Related&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/mygtd.org&quot; &quot;Work&quot;) &quot;* TODO %? %a %u \n\n &quot;) 
 But if I&#x27;m someplace other than an email, I want the same key combination C-c c a w to open this template:
 (&quot;aw&quot; &quot;Work Related&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/mygtd.org&quot; &quot;Work&quot;) &quot;* TODO %? %u \n\n &quot;) 
 Which is exactly the same, except it has no %a in it.
 How would I do that?

                              <span>Hi all,
 seems I am too stupid to customize modes for my text file editing, either via manually changing the .emacs or via M-x customize or via Easy Customize menu. Have read all online doc, internet search, &quot;Learning GNU Emacs&quot; book. Have tested dozens of variants given in these sources for manual changes in .emacs, but regardless which variant, when I open my file, none is active and shown in mode line. Only I managed to set fill-column via Easy Customize dialog ad the adwaita look.
 I simply want to have text-mode, enriched-mode, auto-fill-mode, flyspell-mode set as standard for working buffer. 
 Here is my latest .emacs: 
 (custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook t)
 &#x27;(ansi-color-faces-vector
 [default default default italic underline success warning error])
 &#x27;(ansi-color-names-vector
 [&quot;black&quot; &quot;red3&quot; &quot;ForestGreen&quot; &quot;yellow3&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;magenta3&quot; &quot;DeepSkyBlue&quot; &quot;gray50&quot;])
 &#x27;(custom-enabled-themes &#x27;(adwaita))
 &#x27;(display-fill-column-indicator t)
 &#x27;(fill-column 75)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;auto-fill-mode)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;enriched-mode)
 &#x27;(add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;flyspell-mode))
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 ) 
 If anyone could advise, I would be happy!

                              <span>I&#x27;m having trouble customizing emacs.
 I have learned how to use hooks to switch things on and off, e.g.:
  (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;visual-line-mode) 
 So that text files will open with word wrap on.
 What I&#x27;ve not been able to do is to pass a value in on starting a mode, e.g.:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; doesn&#x27;t work
 (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;text-scale-adjust 3))
 or
 (add-hook &#x27;text-mode-hook &#x27;text-scale-adjust &amp;eval (&#x27;text-scale-adjust 3))
 doesn&#x27;t work
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m sure you can see what I&#x27;m trying to do -- when in text mode, automatically enlarge the text so that I can read it.
 I have read the manual -- but unfortunately that part of the manual (23.1.1 Running Hooks) doesn&#x27;t give any examples.
 I think the bit that reads: &quot;If a hook variable has a non-nil value, that value should be a list of functions. run-hooks calls all the functions, one by one, with no arguments.&quot; refers to what I&#x27;m trying to do, but how I write a list of functions that evaluates to &quot;3&quot; I&#x27;ve no idea.
 Any help appreciated.

 [mc] problem in ‘mc/execute-this-command-for-all-cursors’: Marker does not point anywhere 
 but the issue inside &#x60;mc/execute-this-command-for-all-cursors-1&#x60; hasn&#x27;t stood out to me yet..i&#x27;m on a very recent version &#x60;20211112.2223&#x60; which seems to be as of the lastest commit to its repo

                              <span>Just curious for a quick n dirty read, so sorry if I missed your favorite distro or bundled yours with one you dislike; I&#x27;m no linux guru, I&#x27;m in the middle of a distro hopping soul searching journey right now.
 Lemme know how good your OS is at integrating with emacs, bonus points if you suggest a window manager too.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m sorry that people are upset with me for the way I&#x27;ve set up the poll, I am close to a total newcomer to Linux, and I&#x27;ve just seen these groupings of distros around (usually referring to difficulty/level of customization) so I figured it was a fine enough compromise since I couldn&#x27;t add them all as poll options. As for why I didn&#x27;t include various distros like BSDs, as some commenters guessed, I just had never heard of them before.
 Also sorry that it&#x27;s single choice, it slipped my mind and I can&#x27;t change it now

If not would wrapping stuff in calls to elpy be the best option or should I just write the python commands I want to use as individual scripts then call them through the shell command functions? In case it&#x27;s relevant the library is https://pypi.org/project/FlightRadarAPI/

I&#x27;d like to bind evil-mode&#x27;s &quot;K&quot; key (originally &quot;evil-lookup&quot;) to be &quot;lsp-ui-doc-glance&quot; whenever I am in a lsp-ui-mode enabled buffer. My idea is to run a condition check whenever I&#x27;m entering a new buffer, with the buffer-list-update-hook. My code snippet below seems to be working (having tested thoroughly though), but I wonder if there is a more elegant way to achieve this:
 (add-hook &#x27;buffer-list-update-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (when (bound-and-true-p lsp-ui-mode) (define-key evil-motion-state-local-map (kbd &quot;K&quot;) #&#x27;lsp-ui-doc-glance))))

                              <span>Hi to everyone! I&#x27;m an undergraduate Mathematics student with also a great interest in Computer Science. In order to complete my degree, I have to write and discuss a small thesis (roughly 40 to 60 pages long) about a topic of my interest. I&#x27;d like to talk about an overview of the use of Category Theory in Functional Programming, therefore I stumbled upon Haskell and the book &quot;Category Theory for Programmars&quot;. Since there is a lot of material to know about, I&#x27;d kindly ask you, if possible, what you think are the most fundamental or important topics which are worth covering in such a small format. Thanks!

                              <span>I am new to Haskell and have been wondering what are the go-to libraries for web backend development. What are you all using? Also, it would be really appreciable if could point me to some blogs or tutorials related to these libraries?

                              <span>I am doing some testing an I want to check if a function returns the correct data. There is not an Eq instance. Is there a way to check if the returned value references the same data as a variable?
 (Edit: I understand that the following is not a valid solution) I was looking at GHC.Ptr but I have not seen a way to a -&gt; Ptr a and it seems to not be intended for native types.
 Is there a way to check if two variables reference the same data (not checking for equality of the data)?

 I&#x27;m trying to get flyspell to play nice with electric-quote-mode. Basically, especially in org-mode, I want to be able to use &#x27;smart&#x27; quotes without each instance of e.g. isn’t being marked as a spelling error.
 Aspell only seems to like straight quotes
 I&#x27;ve looked around the customization options for flyspell but haven&#x27;t found anything that looks relevant. And it occurred to me that I cannot be the only person dealing with this problem. So I come here asking for help. Anyone?
 (I found a post by Artur Malabarba offering a solution to this problem but I&#x27;m wondering if others have other fixes.)

 This blog post is a brief one about a small sed script that can be used to very quickly tangle certain types of org mode files:

 That post also contains a link to the GitHub repository containing the script.

 Fountain was originally made for Screenplays, but I&#x27;d love to be able to type something like 
 FX:
 And then have the following words underscored and in all caps until a manual line-break.
 Does anybopdy know how I can write that function into the mode? Is there an elisp-way to do it?

 GNU Emacs 27.2 MacOS Monterey
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried since use-package failed.
  
package-refresh-contents
 package-install  lsp-mode -- this fails.
  
package-compute-transaction: Package ‘spinner-1.7.3’ is unavailable
 package-archives is a variable defined in ‘package.el’. Its value is ((&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)) 
 I&#x27;ve confirmed that both lsp-mode and lsp-pyright exist on Melpa unstable. Package-refresh-contents works fine. I just keep getting the same message about spinner-1.7.3 not being available. I can&#x27;t even think how I would debug this further. :(

                              <span>So, to understand my problem, let me explain my situation.
 I am Greek and naturally a lot of my files are in greek. To make org export to a latex pdf properly, if it has greek characters, you need to add some packages to it. I have those in my org-latex-packages-alist and everything exports just fine. 
 However, when we get to exporting org-roam files (or any file that contains file links for that matter), there is a problem. The org latex export backend typically exports a link like \href{file_name}{description}. If the file name is in greek (which odds are it is), latex starts to freak out a bit. Org will export perfectly to latex, but latex won&#x27;t export to pdf. To my understanding, it doesn&#x27;t understand the greek characters in the file name (which it should as it understands them everywhere else) and it chooses not to export.
 After a lot of searching, I did manage to find a solution to this in this post. Basically, if the link is of the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description}, it exports perfectly. From what I understand, that command just makes it recognize any unicode character for file names. 
 So my question is, can you configure the org latex export backend to export links in the form \href{\detokenize{file_name}}{description} and not \href{file_name}{description} as it does by default. I couldn&#x27;t find any option that changes how hyperref makes its links in the hyperref manual, nor could I find how org exports its links to latex in the org-export manual, so if anyone here knows, it would help me greatly.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have slowly transitioned from PyCharm to Emacs for my coding development and It&#x27;s been about 6 months now and in general am very happy with my workflow in Emacs. There is just one thing that is still pulling me back to PyCharm and it is something that others might not find too useful but I constantly use. 
 It is the tree-like structure overview for your code that PyCharm has that you can toggle on the left and it looks like this. 
 Now I know I can get a directory overview with the treemacs package and I also know about the iMenu command which is very nice but not exactly a static tree-like structure you can look at. I was wondering if there exists a package to show the class/functions/ structure of a file on the side as you can see on the picture above. 
 Thank you for your help.

 ​
 Example with two entries having a #Bib tag.
 I am not sure which component is responsible for such search results. Is it ivy, ivy-rich or counsel. I am using all of them in my init.el.
 After an update of all packages via M-x list-packages + U + x the tag column is gone. In which package should I look into to find the correct setting/variable or open a ticket for it.

                              <span>Consult-project defines an endpoint for accessing different sources related to the common project workflow. Using Consult&#x27;s narrowing system, the user is able to access the current project&#x27;s buffers, project files and all the known projects, in case they want to change projects quickly. Consult-project provides an extension to the default Consult functionality, using the built-in package project.el, defining the functions consult-project and consult-project-other-window. Furthermore, Consult-project only depends on consult, resulting in a lean and simple to maintain functionality.
 ⚠️ NOTE: This package has come to life adapting the great package consult-projectile by OlMon. Most if not all credit should go to him, I have been using his package for months now. What inspired me to create this package is my recent effort to avoid most third party packages, specially if they prefer a newly defined interface over the built-in Emacs interface.
 Also special shutout to Daniel Mendler for making such a great package!
 I would appreciate any feedback, I&#x27;ll try to submit the package to MELPA next.

 I have been trying to set up a vscode like debug experience and I feel like I am close but not there yet. 
 I want to be able to debug JS, TS, C/C++, Rust and Go.
 This is my config https://github.com/andrerogers/dotfiles/blob/master/.cfg/emacs/emacs.el
 Any help in modifying this to ensure I&#x27;m using lsp and dap correctly for the above languages, and to the best of its current ability, would be much appreciated.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Does anyone know how to auto generate variable type for Rust in emacs. 
 For example, when you type out the variable 
 let msg &#x3D; &quot;something&quot;; 
 it will auto populate
 let msg: &amp;str &#x3D; &quot;something&quot;; 
 Similar to the way that VS code does it.

                              <span>I want to write:
 class PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow :: a -&gt; String instance Pretty a &#x3D;&gt; PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow &#x3D; show . pretty instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; PrettyOrShow a where prettyOrShow a &#x3D; show 
 Now the behavior I want is: if my type is known (at compile-time) to be Show, then use show, but if I know Pretty, then use pretty OVER the show instance (subsequent instances might take further precedence, but I don&#x27;t need more instances to be possible). The part of resolution order makes sense to me (with some configuration of OVERLAPS/OVERLAPPABLE).
 But I know why I can&#x27;t write this - the a in the instance definitions match all types! And the instance resolution simply does not use the constraints to resolve the instances. My understanding of the reasoning for this design is that Haskell would become internally inconsistent, because in different contexts, prettyOrShow could have different behavior for the same types in different contexts. Great - I love that - super safe. But in this case I DONT CARE. I want to write this out of convenience - so I don&#x27;t care about safety here - if the behavior is inconsistent I will still sleep deeply and peacefully . If we had dependent constraints or something similar, perhaps this would be easy - but as it stands - this is not...
 Is there a way to do what I want to do? Make it as grimy as you like. Use reflection if you must but bonus points if its raw GHC Haskell: we will all bask in the ugliness.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in Google summer of code event but missed it last year. I want to attend the event this year and notice that Haskell.org was one of the organizations. It sounds really exciting, I hope Haskell.org will participate in GSoC this year as well. But I have little experience with Haskell, I&#x27;m worried about how to write an expressive proposal when I don&#x27;t even know which projects they will focus on. Can anyone give me so resources or suggestions about the following question?
  
How can I predict the projects this year? (Where can I find out some clues?)
 Which materials should I go through to master required basic skills, including reading books, articles (both blogs and papers), open-source project code, and any other resource? I can only finish some 1-3 kyu problems on CodeWars now. (My CodeWars Profile)
 How to write an attractive proposal in GSoC for working with Haskell.org? I can find very few accepted GSoC proposals on the Internet, many of which were even written several years ago. I have almost no idea about how to write the proposal, especially for Haskell.org, can you provide me with some examples for references?
  
Thanks a lot.

 I have two questions, and both of them are about this commit: https://github.com/sekunho/swapi/tree/59277e41bd12b6f390600c78f12742f5da335aea.
 Static binary
 Currently I&#x27;m not really aware of exactly what libs I need to build a static binary with cabal build; locally in nix develop. 
  
Output
 Packages in flake.nix
 swoogle&#x27;s ghc-options in swapi.cabal
  
It does work fine in the CI (I think) since I&#x27;m using the ghc-musl image, but I&#x27;m not sure how that translates to a Nix environment, unfortunately. Building it with dynamic linking does work though (by removing the ghc-options under the swoogle executable), but I&#x27;d like for it to be consistent between CI and the dev environment, for the most part. 
 Discrepancies in CI and dev
  
Dockerfile
 GitHub Actions file
 cabal.project.freeze
 swapi.cabal
  
This has more to do with how cabal resolves the dependencies. So this is the result of the most recent job: (GitHub Actions, PasteBin).
 My question here is, despite freezing the dependencies (and committing it), why does cabal resolve them differently? Locally it all builds, and runs just fine. But in the CI it seems to be complaining about conflicting versions of base, for example. At one point it also complained about req, and some other libraries. I think I&#x27;m missing something obvious to make it consistent between both environments. I don&#x27;t understand where it pulled that new base version from.
 I&#x27;ll try to provide more information if ever what I&#x27;ve provided so far is insufficient. Thanks.

                              <span>Ok, I&#x27;ve been learning akka, and I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around thread safety. Let&#x27;s recap
 JAVA THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 All threads have their own little slice of memory exclusive to that thread. Periodically the JVM will sync the thread memory values to main memory, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed when that will happen. This is why different threads can see different values of a variable.
 Volatile of course bypasses this by making a given variable always be read/written from/to main memory. Synchronized enforced the other piece of this, ensuring that only one thread at a time can interact with it to prevent race conditions.
 AKKA ACTOR THREAD MEMORY MODEL
 So I do not totally understand this, but here is what I do understand. AKKA has its own thread pool, and is purely message based. A given actor is executed on any available thread when a message is present for that actor.
 The first thing that trips me up is that Akka only executes a message on a given actor one at a time. Ie, a given actor will process messages synchronously. I could be wrong about this, please tell me if I am. This just seems like a bad model for concurrency vs a more traditional approach like the thread-per-request model of a traditional webapp like Spring.
 The second thing is that while this kind of message processing rule would prevent race conditions, it feels like memory consistency would still be an issue. If an actor can be operated on by multiple threads, even if those threads can&#x27;t touch it concurrently, how do all the threads see the same state value? Wouldn&#x27;t there be a risk of memory consistency issues? Are actors somehow made entirely volatile?
 CONCLUSION
 I clearly do not understand some key stuff here. Guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I apologize in advance, I&#x27;m very new to Org and Emacs in general. I&#x27;m not using any pre-configured Emacs.

 I tried to export it with C-c C-e m m:
 # Table of Contents 1. [Test](#org358707a)  # Test ![img](./img/test.jpg &quot;test&quot;) 
 Which is almost perfect but the #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px wasn&#x27;t exported.
 I then tried with pandoc C-c C-e p g (and in CLI with pandoc -i reddit.org -o reddit.md):
 @:t ::t |:t ^:{} \_:{} \*:t TeX:t LaTeX:t # Test ![](./img/test.jpg) 
 Looks like pandoc doesn&#x27;t care about my options and even wrote some of them as plain text and the size for my image is still not here.
 Is there a way to achieve it (other than writing 
 #+html:  
 Because I tried:
 * Test #+CAPTION: test #+NAME: fig:test #+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export #+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400xp [[./img/test.jpg]] #+html:  
 But the image is still exported.
 And why does pandoc export my options as plain text?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Doom-Emacs, but I doubt if that matters. I wanted to start journaling whatever stuff is in my head. Org-journal seems like what I want/need, but the formatting is just weird. Perhaps I&#x27;m trying to use it in a way that&#x27;s not intended. Below is an example:
 * Tuesday, 02/15/2022
 ** 09:20 Is this supposed to be a header? I&#x27;d rather be notes here instead of having a header.
 This is the start of the next paragraph. I think it would look better if it started such that all text lines up, so &quot;This&quot; would start under the previous paragraphs &quot;Is&quot;.

 I want to make a diary/log/journal file (org-capture with datetree should be fine), but...
 I want to be able to browse, but I want to limit editing to a smaller section of the file, similar how I can edit &quot;#begin_src&quot; block using &quot;org-edit-special&quot; in a new frame/window.
 I need this as a psychological effect of saying &quot;now I will change (and only this entry)&quot; and &quot;now I will only view&quot; (I don&#x27;t need this for every orgmode file, but especially in my journal where any edit to a previous section must be conscious).
 Hit me. What can a beginner do to achieve this? What is available right now?
 EDIT/NOTES: this is not about making a file read-only or about making backups or versioning. It is about the actual process of a human CONFIRMING himself that it wants to change stuff.

                              <span>Hi all!
I&#x27;m new to zettelkasten. I&#x27;ve been playing with it for just a few days now, and I&#x27;ve already found some of the KMs very helpful.
Thanks, @Will, for many of them!
I was wondering if anyone had ever created a KM for inserting a link to a structure note on a zettel.
For me, I put my links to the structure note and other zettels at the very bottom of each zettel. I&#x27;ve used the naming convention for structure notes that includes the • between the UID and the text title.
I was thinking if there was a way to set it up so it worked something like this:
I place my cursor in the appropriate location in my zettel.
I enter the key combination for the KM to insert my structure note link.
It then gives me a prompt, asking me which structure note I want to link to (it would limit it to those zettels with the • in the title).
I select the appropriate structure note.
It automatically enters that structure note as a link in the format of UID and text title of the structure note.
Is this possible? Is it unnecessary?
The reverse of this would be a time saver too. For me, I often add a link to my newest zettel to my structure note immediately after I create the zettel. So, if there was a way to go back to my structure note and use a KM to create a link to the most recently created zettel (of even a prompt to choose from one of the more recently created zettels) that would save time too.
Or, have you guys found ways to save time and do this without a KM macro?</span>

 SimpleX Chat for terminal is built in Haskell, and with a lot of help from u/angerman - thank you! - we made the same core work both on iOS and Android platforms.
 To exchange messages privately you can connect either via the invitation link you can share from the app or by scanning QR code from the app on their phone (e.g., during video call or in person).
 More information about SimpleX and iOS app is in this post: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/blog/20220214-simplex-chat-ios-public-beta.md
 We really look forward to your feedback – you can connect to the team from the app settings (it will be myself or somebody else replying to you:)
 Please star the repo on GitHub (thanks a lot if you did already!) and share iOS app beta with your friends – Android app is coming in a few weeks too!

                              <span>Hey guys, I have written an introduction level implementation of linter and interpreter in haskell with mtl style and some technique from Abstracting Definitional Interpreters to write interpreter extension. Would be grateful If any one would review, comments and give advices.

                              <span>I had to write a rather big university assignment in Haskell a year ago where a particular pattern emerged in the code. There were multiple situations where we had function call chains that looked like this:
 foo -&gt; bar -&gt; baz -&gt; foo -&gt; bar -&gt; baz etc. etc.
 Baz had some conditional behavior in it that either quit the &quot;loop&quot; or returned back to foo again. In the case of the assignment the data being passed around was data for the solution to a puzzle.
 The code worked, but the more I think about it the sketchier it seems.
 Does this seem appropriate or should it be avoided?

                              <span>It seems like the visibility property on a parent heading overrides the visibility property on a child heading - is this expected? e.g. when I have the raw text:
 * Foo :PROPERTIES: :VISIBILITY: content :END: ** Bar :PROPERTIES: :VISIBILITY: folded :END: *** Baz 
 ... I would expect (and would like) to see
 * Foo... * Bar... 
 e.g. where Foo shows only the content below it, and Bar has all of its children folded. Instead, I get
 * Foo... * Bar... * Baz... 
 e.g., behavior like if Foo and Bar both &quot;had their visibility&quot; set to &quot;content&quot; (I&#x27;m aware that&#x27;s not how the internals work but I&#x27;m not sure how else to articulate what I mean). Is there a way to prevent this and get the behavior I&#x27;d expect?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a little package to integrate tab-bar, project.el, and buffer-isolation. This seems to be a thing lots of people want so I thought I&#x27;d share it here. I&#x27;m not a programmer, so this code is almost certainly worse than it could be (though I&#x27;ve been helped by looking at lots of other people&#x27;s code). It works for my use-case and I&#x27;ve done some basic unit-testing, but am happy to hear of things that need fixing.
 https://github.com/mclear-tools/emacs-workspaces
 Note that this doesn&#x27;t affect one&#x27;s tab-bar, tab-line, or project.el config in any way. It just adds a few convenience functions to set things up for isolated buffers and for creating or opening workspaces.

                              <span>Apparently there is a package called python. It&#x27;s built-in, and also distributed through GNU ELPA: https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/python.html
 And there is different one called python-mode in MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/python-mode, with upstream at https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode/
 What is the difference between them?
 The background of my question is that I tried to setup my Emacs 27 as a python environment with a language server like David Wilson (aka SystemCrafter) described in his tutorial. This is a codesnippet of it.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (use-package lsp-mode :commands (lsp lsp-deferred) :init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix &quot;C-l&quot;) :config (lsp-enable-which-key-integration t) )
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am not sure but it looks like that the python-mode here cause the use of the MELPA version of python-mode. How can I setup the inbuild python mode of Emacs include the use of the language server?

 I was looking for alternatives to org-mode, not because there is anything wrong with it, but because I use it only for note taking and sometimes TODO and was wondering what else is there.
 Another thing with org is that sometimes the ecosystem, for someone not doing GTD or writing a paper etc. can feel a bit overwhelming. 
 I didn&#x27;t find a lot of info about howm, except a couple posts here, including a 15 year old link that is dead (thank heavens to the Wayback Machine). But I can infer there are some active users between this subreddit and the Emacs Wiki.
 I like the way it links info with &gt;&gt;&gt; and the schedules with special sorting for TODO vs deadline vs reminder seems interesting.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am a new convert to emacs. I tried in the past to get my head around it for simple plain text editing, but it never really clicked. Recently I got back into it (mainly via vim -&gt; evilmode) and I am currently hacking away on my own config. (The stream series &quot;Emacs from Scratch&quot; by System Crafters was insanely helpful.)
 I am a physics postgrad and use R for data analysis and yihui&#x27;s suite of R packages for any type of write-up/publishing.
  
RMarkdown: Simple Markdown syntax to write documents with R code blocks mainly to avoid writing LaTeX directly and for reproducibility.
 bookdown: Write scientific reports in RMarkdown and export them to html (Github Pages) and pdf with references and citations.
 blogdown: Publish my personal website via a simple RMarkdown syntax and easy to use R-functions. (Not thaaaat important to me, I don&#x27;t blog regularly)
  
I have realised that I can do most of those things also using orgmode. Is someone here who made a similar switch from the RMarkdown ecosystem to orgmode, who could point me in the right direction regarding workflows, packages or tutorials etc? I am slowly getting paralysed by the amount of possibilities I have with emacs and now orgmode....
 ​
 edit: I mainly want to switch to emacs with orgmode to get away from RStudio. I feel it can be quite limiting.

                              <span>I switched from PhpStorm to Emacs for my Php editing and it feels amazing, I feel much more comfortable and productive using all my familiar keybindings, tools and modes.
 I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with intelephense as the back-end. Code completion works great, but I&#x27;m missing the usual alerts that I got with PhpStorm which showed, in the method signature, which exceptions where thrown but not catched.
 What do you guys use for that? Should I use another specific tool for it or maybe should I switch to another LSP back-end, ...?
 Thanks a lot in advance!
 EDIT: as a front-end for linting, I&#x27;m using the built-in flymake-mode.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been playing with emacs for about 2 weeks or so, really liking it so far (I&#x27;ve been using vim/neovim for about 6 years now).
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to make it so that when I C-c in a src block in org-mode, it first checks all related src blocks in the file, tangle them together in a temporary buffer and only then execute the buffer, providing the results needed.
 Is there a native way to do that? Am I supposed to use the post-tangle hook org-babel provides?
 For now what I&#x27;m doing is:
 - create all src blocks setting the tangle to a file location I can access, like #+begin_src typescript :tangle ~/tmp/this-is-a-test.ts
 - run org-babel-tangle
 - running the compiler on that file manually to find out the results
 However, that is tedious and I want to figure out a way to …</span>

 However, if I try to do that, then the last two lines become actual headings. This stack exchange answer might effectively contain a good answer, but I wanted to double-check here. https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/16688/how-can-i-escape-the-in-org-mode-to-prevent-bold-fontification

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m trying to get my head around sbt, I have a little issue now to read files from src/main/resources.
 If I build the jar with sbt package the resource is in the jar, if I run the class I can read the file with getResourceAsStream, but not when doing sbt run.
 How do I make them part of the classpath of sbt run? 
 Example code:
 ----- build.sbt ----- mainClass :&#x3D; Some(&quot;App&quot;) ----- src/main/resources/file.txt ----- content ----- src/main/scala/App.scala ----- object App { def main(args : Array[String]) { println(classOf[App].getResourceAsStream(&quot;/file.txt&quot;)) } } ----- output of sbt run ----- [... omissis ...] null ----- output of scala -classpath target/scala-2.12/test_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar App ----- sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection$JarURLInputStream@453da22c

                              <span>Hi,
I&#x27;m working on some notes and I&#x27;m a bit confused on the process I should use.
I have note which is about &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; where I talk about the differences between the two.
It comes from the Zettelkasten method, and it gave me ideas on many other subjects, like therapy, coaching and marketing.
I also already have a note that says &quot;It&#x27;s not about what you know, it&#x27;s about what you do with what you know&quot;, talking about the ideas that knowledge is not enough, and that it&#x27;s acting on knowledge that builds and create things. That note is also connected to coaching and therapeutic ideas.
I had some epiphanies and good concepts while working on those notes, and that created 2 other notes.
At first, I was writing everything in the first note &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; which was becoming almost like the start of an article. The &quot;flow&quot; got to me and I wrote some good ideas and made some good connections.
I&#x27;m new to Zettelkasten but I remember the Permanent / Evergreen notes should be atomic and if possible, quite short.
So I splited my &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; note into 5 different notes.
I now have 5 different notes, linked together, talking about the same idea.
In a MOC about Therapeutic Changes, I added all those 5 notes.
It&#x27;s a bit confusing to me because naturally I would have kept &quot;Transform information into knowledge&quot; and let that note because a bit longer and like an &quot;index&quot; of all the others ideas, and put that note into my Therapeutic MOC.
And when I see examples here and there I feel like permanent notes are not &quot;that short&quot; and even sometimes, not that atomic.
What&#x27;s the best method here in your opinion ? What&#x27;s your take on this ?
Thanks a lot</span>

Is there some caveat I&#x27;m missing out on? Or is it just disabled because the potential for information loss is huge in situations where case is significant?

Wondering whether anyone has written something to render an arbitrary keymap in a transient menu? Of course transient menu items need names, but you could just use the symbol names.

                              <span>So I have a chunk of hexadecimal digits in a buffer, I want to convert it to raw bytes. I happen to know the raw bytes are going to all be ASCII characters.
 Here is the solution I have so far:
 I start with this:
 74686520717569636b2062726f776e20 666f78206a756d706564206f76657220 746865206c617a7920646f67 
 I run this on the buffer
 (let ((case-replace nil)) (replace-regexp &quot;[[:xdigit:]]\\{2\\}&quot; &quot;\\\\x\\&amp;&quot;) (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp &quot;^&quot; &quot;(insert \&quot;&quot;) (goto-char (point-min)) (replace-regexp &quot;$&quot; &quot;\&quot;)&quot;)) 
 That makes the buffer into this:
 &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20&quot; &quot;\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20&quot; &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67&quot; 
 Now I make it into a Lisp expression:
 (goto-char (point-min)) (insert &quot;(insert\n&quot;) (goto-char (point-max)) (insert &quot;)&quot;) 
 Now my buffer has this:
 (insert &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x71\x75\x69\x63\x6b\x20\x62\x72\x6f\x77\x6e\x20&quot; &quot;\x66\x6f\x78\x20\x6a\x75\x6d\x70\x65\x64\x20\x6f\x76\x65\x72\x20&quot; &quot;\x74\x68\x65\x20\x6c\x61\x7a\x79\x20\x64\x6f\x67&quot;) 
 Finally I do this:
 (eval (read (prog1 (buffer-string) (erase-buffer)))) 
 and I get the result I want
 the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog 
 Is there a better way to do this? It would especially be nice to do this without (eval (read (buffer-string))). Note that this function needs to run on arbitrary length string inputs scattered throughout a buffer, but mostly operate on only 2-8 bytes of hexadecimal encoded data at a time, so something that works efficiently on small strings is best.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have been using emacs and writing simple functions for a while, I had also tried to make minor modes previously, and have made things that were super useful to me, but those were so niche that I didn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s be useful. But this time I made something that I think might be useful to others so I&#x27;m sharing it here.
 This is a minor mode that can do well with LaTeX or org-mode. 
 What it does is: convert valid lisp expressions to LaTeX expressions. As you know we can evaluate lisp expressions directly in emacs (C-x C-e), so I had this thought why not use emacs as a calculator while typing the text without the need to move to another buffer to calculate things. But the problem was I couldn&#x27;t leave the lisp expressions as it is if I have to submit the paper somewhere. S…</span>

 As in the title; I want to use uuid&#x27;s for links to other parts of my files, but they won&#x27;t all be on the same system. Essentially, between all my projects, all in different git repositories, I want to link to different parts of their documentation, and was wondering how uuid links would translate to html duing org-html-export-to-html.
 Thank you kindly for the information!

 I think the results section take up too much, and I would like to make this more compact with something like:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp (cl-position 2 &#x27;(2 6 7)) #+end_src &#x3D;&gt; 0 
 I have a couple of questions regarding this change:
  
How would I go about making this work? I am pretty new to directly touching the Emacs packages themselves, so not sure how this would look.
 Are there any drawbacks to this approach that I might not have considered?
  
Thanks.

                              <span>HI, I cannot find on the internet ways to be faster on using org mode to move items between files, I am doing some hacks but I know that there have to be a faster way, to optimize such a repetitive task.
 Intuitively I opened two vertical windows, so that i have in window 1 a file A.org in a buffer, and in window 2 a file B.org in antoher buffer
 What i cut in a file is not pasted as I would expect in the second bufffer:
 1) Selecting ONE heading with relative subheadings, or selecting subheading in windows 1 cutting and pasting in window 2 at a different level of nested level, is painful, because the two files have different level of indentation(I mean number of asterisks). So for example if I have in window 1 a block of text that is at a third level, when I am going to paste in window 2 &#x60;at a specific point&#x60; at a 5th level, is &#x60;not&#x60; going to be recognized that need to be pasted &quot;under&quot; the 5th level and so be recognized as a 6th level the heading(from window 1) and at a 7th level the relative subheading. 
 I would rather select multiple files in window 1 and paste in window 2:
 2) I would like to select multiple headings, or subheadings in window 1 an then just paste them in window 2, so far I have been able only to do it one per time, instead I was expecting to cut in window 1 all the text I needed and then paste all in window2 (I mean like when I am using a resource browser on a PC and I select with control click all the items i need(not consequential) and then paste on a certain point in window 2

                              <span>I’ve recently been assigned an project where I’ve been tasked to create a lexical analyzer with the basis of the main function:
 tokenize :: String -&gt; [(String, Token)]
 and as an arithmetic string as it’s only parameter and without any imported functions (like split)
 I’ve been struggling for the past couple days trying to understand Haskell but having no such luck other than recursion as well as a bit of the split function I made, which I know is used in this project. 
 The output would be something like something like this:
 Input: “(Result * 50) &#x3D; Answer”
 Output: [(“(“, LeftPar),(“Result”, Id),(“*”, Value 50),(“)”, RightPar),(“&#x3D;“, Equals),(“Answer”, Id)]
 I still want to learn so I don’t want the straight full answer, but rather a push in the right direction. Especially when it comes to data type declaration which I know comes into to play here. Any help would be appreciated at this point. Please and thank you.

                              <span>I want to print a string within a do block but Haskell says this is an error. 
 I have the following function:
 getC :: CodeDe -&gt; GenS
 getC c &#x3D; do
 t  GenS
 getC c &#x3D; do
 t &lt;- cType c
 putStrLn (Name c)
 .....
 return $ fmap....
 ​
 I have also tried this in other do blocks. I am confused as this would work in imperative languages. Why can I not print/do something in a do block that is unrelated to the final return?

                              <span>When I set Archive directory to a folder in iCloud I can make and edit notes, but when I try to delete a note (using keyboard shortcut or right click then clicking delete) The Archive freezes, stops responding, and I have to force quit.
This only happens when I set the Archive directory to a folder in iCloud. It doesn&#x27;t happen if the folder is on the desktop, sharepoint, or dropbox.
I wonder if this is an iCloud permissions issue?
I&#x27;m using The Archive version 1.7.5 with macOS Catalina 10.15.7 (this might also be the issue, I&#x27;m using an old mid 2012 macbook pro with an old OS).
Not the biggest issue if I can&#x27;t figure this out, but was wondering if anyone could help?</span>

                              <span>When I set Archive directory to a folder in iCloud I can make and edit notes, but when I try to delete a note (using keyboard shortcut or right click then clicking delete) The Archive freezes, stops responding, and I have to force quit.
This only happens when I set the Archive directory to a folder in iCloud. It doesn&#x27;t happen if the folder is on the desktop, sharepoint, or dropbox.
I wonder if this is an iCloud permissions issue?
I&#x27;m using The Archive version 1.7.5 with macOS Catalina 10.15.7 (this might also be the issue, I&#x27;m using an old mid 2012 macbook pro with an old OS).
Not the biggest issue if I can&#x27;t figure this out, but was wondering if anyone could help?</span>

                              <span>For some backstory, I&#x27;m a full-stack developer with Node (JavaScript) and I&#x27;ve been learning Scala as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a faster programming language and I need something fast to handle some back-end operations in terms of file validation and processing for one of my apps. So far, I&#x27;m loving Scala - seems like a really powerful language and I&#x27;m glad that I have the time to learn it.
 However, I&#x27;ve made a simple test in each language to truly compare the speed of each language when running a large loop, and I&#x27;m finding that JavaScript is actually much faster than Scala in that regard.
 Here&#x27;s a sample of the method I wrote in Scala for the test:
  def runLargeLoop(success: (Int, Long) &#x3D;&gt; Unit, failure: (Throwable) &#x3D;&gt; Unit) &#x3D; { val startTime &#x3D; currentTime val loop &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; Future { var num &#x3D; 0 …</span>

                              <span>Howdy. So I have worked with Scala before but quite a few years ago. It was my big introduction to functional programming and by the end of the project I understood functional programming just well enough to be interested in it. Since then I have studied it extensively in languages that are not purely functional, mainly TypeScript, and this has motivated me to pick up Scala again.
 I know that Scala 3 has just come out. Obviously I would like to work with the latest version. However my experience with other major software updates leaves me a bit wary. I have seen in other ecosystems major updates causing widespread compatibility issues with common libraries resulting in a highly complicated process of figuring out what will and will not work with the new version.
 On that note, I&#x27;m hoping for clarity on a few points:
 1) does scala 2 code compile in a scala 3 project?
 2) will third party libraries written for scala 2 still be compatible with Scala 3? I&#x27;m inclined to say yes because it all compiles to Java bytecode but I just want to be sure.
 3) any other pitfalls that someone with limited scala experience who will be starting with Scala 3 should know?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Basically, similar question to https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/it9vw3/centaurtabs_and_perspmode/
 I just want to be able to have tabs that I can reorganize amongst themselves (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do that with native emacs tabs), and workgroups (e.g: perspective/workgroups/persp-mode/...) to be able to switch from a set of tabs to another set of tabs.
 Currently I have centaur-tabs setup because it&#x27;s the only tab solution that allows me to move tabs (eg: centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-left, centaur-tabs-move-current-tab-to-right), but it doesn&#x27;t play nice with any workgroup packages. Tabs stay visible in all workgroups with perspective
 Has anyone been able to achieve this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a very new newbie. The pdf (https://orgmode.org/orgguide.pdf) already explained tab cycling in two sections back, &quot;2.2 Visibility Cycling&quot;, and I understand that. But then under &quot;2.4 Structure Editing&quot; they indicate this key binding:
  
&quot;TAB in new empty entry: In a new entry with no text yet, TAB cycles through reasonable levels.&quot; 
  
Is that different than the normal tab cycling? I can&#x27;t find that TAB does anything different anywhere, other than normal cycling to me, but maybe I don&#x27;t understand the context (&quot;in a new entry with no text&quot;) or my org file is still too simple to demonstrate this function?

 I&#x27;ve been working through &quot;Haskell Programing from First Principles&quot; for the last few months. I&#x27;m about half way through the book and I Just finished my first real program. I just wanted to say thank you to the community for being so helpful and maybe get some feedback on my code. I&#x27;m sure I could clean up a lot of things.

                              <span>I understand this might be an odd question, I am just trying to research the idea that if a blockchain (e.g Cardano) uses Haskell in building its Dapps, would the Haskell community, language syntax and its libraries allow an average joe programmer to build blockchain Dapps easily and in a short time ? So my question is since I have used Laravel framework before, does Haskell have some tools/frameworks for start ups that abstracts the background work into easy to do steps to set up for example authentication, Database, etc.

                              <span>In several projects, I&#x27;ve needed a way to implement remote procedure calls. What do people use for this, or is this something that&#x27;s mostly missing in the community? Hackage has a variety of libraries but they&#x27;re either very old or seemingly unmaintained. The only one I see that&#x27;s maintained is grpc-haskell.
 Anyway, grpc-haskell uses proto3-wire instead of proto-lens (which the community seems to have settled on as the best solution). This leads to its own confusion.
 I could use something like warp + servant (or warp + wai to reinvent the wheel), but servant is missing some major functionality for this purpose. Namely, servant is focused on REST, which means the transfer of an entire object state. One of the things I want from an RPC system is the ability to stream data in a type-safe manner (like gRPC does). 
 Any thoughts? I&#x27;d prefer something standardized.

 McBride gives us a way to write a variadic zipWith, which (modulo irrelevant details) we can write as
 {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies, FlexibleInstances, UndecidableInstances #-} data Z &#x3D; Z data S n &#x3D; S n nat0 &#x3D; Z :: Z nat1 &#x3D; S nat0 :: S Z nat2 &#x3D; S nat1 :: S (S Z) class ZipWith n fst rest | n fst -&gt; rest where manyApp :: n -&gt; [fst] -&gt; rest instance ZipWith Z t [t] where manyApp Z fs &#x3D; fs instance ZipWith n fst rest &#x3D;&gt; ZipWith (S n) (t -&gt; fst) ([t] -&gt; rest) where manyApp (S n) fs xs &#x3D; manyApp n (zipWith ($) fs xs) nZipWith :: ZipWith n fst rest &#x3D;&gt; n -&gt; fst -&gt; rest nZipWith n f &#x3D; manyApp n (repeat f) 
 then we can call this with nZipWith nat2 (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6].

 This is a map for a two layers Functor.
 Can we have a deepFmap for unknown number of layers Functor?
 for example we have a nested list with many unknown number of dimensions.
 -- each dot represent layers of functor nested inside. deepFmap :: (a-&gt;b) -&gt; [[...[[a]]]..]] -&gt; [[..[[b]]..]] --or When each layer is different from upper or lower layer. deepFmap :: (a-&gt;b) -&gt; MayBe [[..(Maybe...[[a]]...)..]]

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to write an implementation of the tabu search algorithm. Basically local search with a tabu list of recently visited states.
 To do this I need to mess around with parts of Haskell I have never touched before. Type classes.
 I want to generalise the algorithm to the point that the data that the algorithm operates on is completely invisible to the algorithm itself. Like a java interface I want something I can attach to an object type and say &quot;this object is now compatible with this search algorithm&quot;.
 class TabuSt a where evaluate:: a -&gt; Int type ST &#x3D; (Int, [Int]) instance TabuSt ST where evaluate x &#x3D; 0 
 That&#x27;s a toy implementation. I define the type class TabuSt. I define a type alias ST. And I define the instance of the type class. I also define a function evaluate that takes a state and returns an integer evaluation of the state. Note that it does not compile.
 This is the error message &quot;tabu.hs:12:10: error: • Illegal instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’ (All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn) where T is not a synonym. Use TypeSynonymInstances if you want to disable this.) • In the instance declaration for ‘TabuSt ST’&quot;
 Why does this not work?

                              <span>I currently use doom emacs. I&#x27;ve been searching for hours but can&#x27;t figure out a way to do this. 
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to write that 
  
automatically adds paragraph indents to new lines when I press Enter but doesn&#x27;t indent the entire text block (like in Scrivener, word, etc.)
 Formats it nicely like a fiction novel when I export it to pdf
  
I would like it to look like Composition mode in Scrivener or in Manuskript (I tried Manuskript but found it very slow, so I moved over to Emacs). I&#x27;ve tried almost every built-in paragraph/indent mode, Olivetti, and Writeroom Mode, but none of them seem to work.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m new here and to emacs, so sorry if I&#x27;m asking a repeated question or something just not acceptable for some reason.
 I&#x27;ve used vim for many years and then neovim for about two years. I am/was very happy with neovim&#x27;s current state of plugins, ecosystem, lua configuration and vi&#x27;s philosophy on editing text.
 However I&#x27;ve reached a point where I 
 A) have become very interested in lisp languages and
 B) realized that I would like a much more flexible and complete computing environment that goes beyond my text editor. 
 Funnily enough this problem was solved many years ago by the dark side (just a joke 🤣). So I&#x27;m pretty excited to dive into Emacs, learn all about it and I know today its exactly the tool Id like for the rest of my computing career.
 I wanted to ask however to other emacs users, especially ex-Vimmers if readily slapping evil on emacs to make myself comfortable (at least on the text editing side) can hinder me from learning all the ins and outs of emacs?
 I have grown very accustomed to vim&#x27;s text editing experience. Its so precise and short. I&#x27;m very used to changing text with up to 3 or 4 keystrokes to a precision that is very hard to get out of. I mean this in the best of ways, I really like Emacs and am having a lot of fun learning it. I&#x27;m just asking to better understand how I should go about this. I&#x27;d imagine that the text editing part is such a minor attribute of the power of Emacs and what its capable of that maybe it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference how one chooses to edit text.
 Thanks in advance 👍

This works great, but when I run emacs using emacs --daemon and I exit using :q, I am being asked if I want to save the current file.

                              <span>Hi Emacsers,
 I&#x27;ve spent some time learning Elisp closures and lexical binding.
 Although the documentation is clear with simple examples, I needed to to play with other examples to get my bearings.
 As you might be interested, I share them with you :)
 The first section contains the info nodes and help corresponding to the examples.
 The second section shows 10 &quot;basic&quot; examples using lexical-binding, lambda, defun, let, lexical-let, setq and defvar.
 And the third section shows a more advanced example using lambda, let, dolist and defun.
 Have a nice day,
 ps: In the documentation, we can read &quot;Lexical binding is also more compatible with concurrency, which was added to Emacs in version 26.1.&quot;.
 Is someone know why is this? And can you indicate me the files in the emacs source code where …</span>

                              <span>I have configured emacs to be able to work with react and typescript using lsp, I also use eslint as a linter.I want to be able to fix lint error on save, to do so i&#x27;ve set &#x60;lsp-eslint-auto-fix-on-save&#x60; but when I save a linted file it mess up and for instance change all my 2 space indent to a 4 space wide tab, but the weird part is when resaving the file that as been messed up it&#x27;s been fixed as per my eslint configuration.I&#x27;m fairly new to emacs and it seems that there may be a conflict between two on save hooks but I really cannot figure out. You can find my conf here:https://github.com/sganon/emacs/blob/main/init.el
 If you know what I&#x27;m doing wrong or any step that can help me debug this problem that would be awesome.
 Thanks.

 EDIT: I&#x27;ve found that indeed there is a conflict between lsp-eslint-apply-all-fixes and lsp-format-buffer but I&#x27;m not sure why yet

                              <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;m using Emacs-IPython-Notebook with Elpy. It was a struggle to find the right documentation to get an initial setup up and running, but, I finally got these tools working, and I&#x27;m very happy now that I can develop Jupyter Notebooks in Emacs.
 Anyways, my question has to do with being able to run Python/JavaScript Widgets in Emacs, specifically in Emacs-IPython-Notebook(and emacs-jupyter as well). I did try last year to run pywidgets in EIN, but it did not work. Anyways, I was reading a article in r/emacs a while back(I can&#x27;t find it anymore, lol) about Emacs now being able run browser widgets. So that&#x27;d be great to get that working, so that I can run browser Widgets in Emacs.
 Could any of you enlighten me on this issue?
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>wgrep is a super useful mode, and combining it with git grep would be even much more of a game changer. Is there a way to make it work?
 Running M-x grep and then changing that command to use git grep instead of regular grep works for displaying the results, but when I do wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode, it won&#x27;t let me modify and save the results.

 Hi! I upgraded to org-roam v2 about two months ago after using v1 for a few months before that. I felt org-roam-server quite useful primarily for visualizing which ideas link to which others. However, I haven&#x27;t felt the same introauitiveness with org-roam-ui (the server counterpart for v2). And the graph always seems too cluttered and rather difficult to use for purposes of idea-link visualization. Has anyone else felt this? Is it just a matter of getting used to?
 PS: org-roam-ui certainly is useful for checking nodes and obtaining a visually appealing overview of the personal knowledge base. But something feels off. I wonder if it is related to different coloring algorithms, wherein org-roam-server seems to color &quot;daughter&quot; nodes close to the parent node, especially if the parent node is a &quot;hub&quot;, whereas org-roam-ui seems to use no such heuristic. Just a guess!

I wanted to share how I got to this point. Also, fyi I decided to start with plain emacs since most tutorials and internet reference materials are based on this.
 My learning method:
  
Start with built in tutorial. Practice each command shown a few times. Do as much as I can each day. 5 min, 10 min, an hour, whatever. NEVER use the mouse to move the insertion point or switch windows! ALWAYS use standard keyboard commands.

                              <span>for example, lets say I wanted to modify the !! function to make it not a partial function. Would this be possible? thank you.

                              <span>I just discovered EdgeDB: https://www.edgedb.com/
 I&#x27;ve been waiting for a database with a better query language ever since rethinkDB died. Specifically, EdgeDB stores object graphs natively, has a neat and composable query language, native migrations, etc. It&#x27;s easy to imagine how we could build type-safe queries for this. (Take a look at the typescript bindings on the main page)
 Is anyone already working on a client for EdgeDB?

 Given the attention effect systems have had, I thought I&#x27;d convert a monomorphic transformer stack into an MTL-style effect and but ran into the following issue, likely due to my effect becoming polymorphic, the related recursive helper type class Fun became polymorphic and stopped working.. 
 The issue (same as on SO):
 I&#x27;d like to use literal haskell functions in a dsl as follows:
 haskell program :: forall m . DSL m &#x3D;&gt; m () program &#x3D; do stm $ Stm (Var &quot;a&quot;) -- this way: f  do -- function body is of the same monad &#x60;m&#x60; as the one in top level stm $ Stm (Var &quot;b&quot;) stm $ Stm $ Apply f (Var &quot;c&quot;) pure () 
 .. and turn the above into code ([Stm]).

 I would like a way to define folds, In html, Its:
  Fold Title Thing to be folded  
 But I don&#x27;t know how to achieve that in org, as far I know I need to define my own markup and then tell org how to export to html? but I dont know elisp or org all that well, I only started using emacs a few weeks ago 
 and another is being able to Content to highlight it, like with drawing a box or using a highlighter on paper 
 If anyone could help, that would be much appreciated, This is on emacs 29 and org 9.5

                              <span>I wrote about applying note-taking reflexes to making music… https://rosano.hmm.garden/01fvmvwv1p0te9nh86z4r2h82x
Seems like isolating ideas into atomized fragments was counter-intuitive in this context, and letting them &#x27;live&#x27; inside compositions strangely makes it easier to find and re-purpose…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
I&#x27;m new on the forum but been reading the articles and the forum since I discovered ZK not long ago. I love it and it already changed my life and the way I work and the way I see what I do. I find the philosophy of it life changing.
Anyway, I have a question I can&#x27;t find the answer too.
Quite some times I read articles that provide a step by step for something, and acronym immediately useful. I don&#x27;t see how I can &quot;put it in my own words&quot;. I could but I feel like it&#x27;s spending time on stuff I really do understand and use. It&#x27;s more like reminders of processes than &quot;knowledge&quot;. The subject fits already into my train of thoughts and the stuff I&#x27;m working on.
What do you do with that kind of notes ? Do they go into the permanent folder ? Do they stay as some kind of literature notes ? How one would find those reminders / process / short tips in a ZK ?
Thanks</span>

This correspondence is known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence and relates:
  
Haskell types with objects of the category
 
Terms of type A→B with morphisms f:A→B (note the similar notations)
 
Algebraic datatypes with initial objects
 
Type constructors with functors
 
etc
 
  
What are algebraic datatypes in Haskell? (I thought all types, including those types defined by datatype, newtype, or type, and/or those types provided by the language and by the standard library modules, are algebraic datatypes. So I think I was wrong.)
 Is the concept &quot;abstract datatype&quot; the same to all the programming languages?
 How are algebraic datatypes related with initial objects?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi guys
 I have been struggling for a few days to figure out how to do this. The majority of resources for Alex / Happy seem to be very outdated, but I&#x27;ve had the most luck with this one: https://github.com/jmoy/alexhappy/blob/master/whitespace/Lexer.x
 It seems to target an old version of Alex though, as when building I get a bunch of compiler errors.
 Here is my code: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/yn3JWSrhAnd these are the errors I get: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/fTZhuGeTAlex version 3.2.6
 Also, when writing monadic parsers / lexers, should I still use the monad wrapper if I define my own monad type?
 Any help appreciated

 Here is the list
  progLanguages &#x3D; [ (&quot;CptS121&quot; , [&quot;C&quot;]), (&quot;CptS122&quot; , [&quot;C++&quot;]), (&quot;CptS223&quot; , [&quot;C++&quot;]), (&quot;CptS233&quot; , [&quot;Java&quot;]), (&quot;CptS321&quot; , [&quot;C#&quot;]), (&quot;CptS322&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;]), (&quot;CptS355&quot; , [&quot;Haskell&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;, &quot;PostScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;]), (&quot;CptS360&quot; , [&quot;C&quot;]), (&quot;CptS370&quot; , [&quot;Java&quot;]), (&quot;CptS315&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;]), (&quot;CptS411&quot; , [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C++&quot;]), (&quot;CptS451&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;C#&quot;, &quot;SQL&quot;]), (&quot;CptS475&quot; , [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;R&quot;]) ] 
 It needs to be compatible with the following
  The type of the max_count function should be compatible with one of the following: max_count :: [(a1, [a2])] -&gt; (a1, Int) max_count :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; [(a1, t a2)] -&gt; (a1, Int) 
 So far, I have attempted the following code
  max_count [] &#x3D; error &quot;bad&quot; max_count [x] &#x3D; x max_count (x:xs) &#x3D; x max_helper (max_count xs) where max_helper (a,b) (a&#x27;,b&#x27;) | length b &gt; length b&#x27; &#x3D; (a, length b) | otherwise &#x3D; (a&#x27;, length b&#x27;) 
 This has not worked in the slightest, and I am at a blank for what to do. Any help is appreciated.

 Stack installed with Homebrew, using managed GHC 8.10.3 (Stackage LTS 17.2)

What I want
 I am trying to minimize reliance on Rosetta, since I&#x27;ve read nasty things happen when combining x86 and ARM toolchains. As a result, I’d like to upgrade my project to GHC 8.10.7 to take advantage of the ARM-native binary. Eventually, I&#x27;d like to migrate this project to Cabal, because HLS and Stack don&#x27;t play well together in test files.
 I&#x27;d also like to start new projects using GHC 9.2.1 to …</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I have a number of latex export classes defined in my init file like so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-classes &#x27;(&quot;my-landscape&quot; &quot;\input{/home/user/.config/emacs/tex/class-my-landscape.tex} [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES] &quot; (&quot;\section{%s}&quot; . &quot;\section{%s}&quot;) (&quot;\subsection{%s}&quot; . &quot;\subsection{%s}&quot;)))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; As you can see, I include another tex file as a preamble and that works quite well.
 However, I would like to get to work on a landscape A4 multiple column class and for this it is suggested one uses \usepackage{multicols} in the preamble, easy enough added to the .tex file. 
 And here is where it gets tricky, one needs to add the line \begin{multicols}{3} after \begin{document} and \end{multicols*} before \end\document}. This is proving to be not trivial to set up for me.
 Does anybody have tips and or suggestions on how to tackle this issue ?
 thx S

                              <span>Here in the org manual, the zero-width space character is the recommended escape for would-be org syntax. Why this choice? An invisible character adds confusion and ambiguity. To me a better solution would be more explicit, perhaps a single-line comment character like the # of python. Or maybe it is a good solution, and I&#x27;m not using org the way it was intended? Help
 Edit: this SO post has some discussion

                              <span>I love Org&#x27;s date parsing abilities and often don&#x27;t even glance at the calendar that pops up, but occasionally I scroll through the calendar (with  or M-v and C-v) a bit before typing a date and it always surprises me that when I press RET the timestamp Org inserts is the date that was selected in the calendar and not the result of parsing what I typed!
 It seems that if you want Org to parse the date you type you cannot interact with the calendar pop up at all, which I find a little frustrating. Is there an easy way to tell Org &quot;forget I scrolled the calendar a bit, use the date I&#x27;m typing?&quot;.

 https://niklaseklund.gitlab.io/blog/posts/dtache_vterm/
 The dtache package, is a package for detached shell commands https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache.
 This is a good alternative for those that want to use dtache but who are not keen on using shell or eshell.

                              <span>Using Manjaro Cinnamon.
 So a few weeks ago, I built Emacs with support for background-only transparency (it&#x27;s awesome btw). The build was a little buggy, but after building, I decided to install it using &#x27;make install&#x27; - having followed some comments on this sub and elsewhere that the side-by-side install would work, since the default directory would be my &#x27;local&#x27;, separate to where Arch puts pacman packages (where my normal Emacs is) - for safety I used the prefix option and called it &#x27;TRANemacs&#x27;.
 But the background-only transparency emacs remained a bit buggy so I decided to uninstall using &#x27;make uninstall&#x27;. Upon running my normal emacs, everything seemed to work normally except that the Cinnamon task bar shows an empty icon where the Emacs logo should be. Further digging shows that emacs has a logo, but emacs-client (which I guess is what gets started) doesn&#x27;t. I reinstalled emacs with pacman but there is no change.
 Further to that, worth noting that it seems like &#x27;make uninstall&#x27; did not cleanly remove everything related to TRANemacs, but I don&#x27;t think the files left behind (e.g. the site-lisp folder) are very important.
 I&#x27;m not great at solving this sort of problem. Might anyone know how can I return the logo to emacs? And how do I prevent multiple emacs installations from clobbering each other in future?

For example, here is a screenshot of org-tree-slide package by T. Ishikawa, cloned from his GitHub repo.

                              <span>It doesn&#x27;t exist yet, lol. But it&#x27;s an idea I just had. I don&#x27;t have the skill to do anything like this, but maybe someone else (or a group of people) do. It would contain music maybe starting slow and crescendoing throughout the commercial. Short scenes of individuals doing crazy complicated physical, artful, skillful /r/nextlevel kind of stuff, interspersed with crazy text on a screen moving around (typical org mode stuff, LaTeX editing, etc.), matrix looking stuff, more individuals performing high precision things, etc. Building up, and then ending with a finale and &quot;Emacs&quot; with logo on the screen. Fade to black. 
 I&#x27;ve read a few posts here and there about the need to get more people into Emacs. They usually focus on &quot;how to change emacs to appeal to a wider audience&quot;. I&#x27;m not going to touch that subject, but simple marketing can be powerful. When I search google for &quot;Emacs Commercial&quot; I get a grand total of 20 results (none of which is a commercial). Youtube returns zero.
 Surely there&#x27;s some skillful people out there, passionate about Emacs, who would also like to work on or collaborate on a few commercials? I could see another commercial that has testimonials from people.
 FYI, I&#x27;m an emacs newbie, and am excited about learning it. Apologies in advance if this isn&#x27;t a good idea or if this kind of post doesn&#x27;t belong here.

                              <span>Hello.
 I often need to act with Embark not on the symbol or plain value, but rather on the result of its evaluation. For example I&#x27;d like to be able to open the value of user-emacs-directory by using embark-act on this symbol. Is there some trick I&#x27;ve missed?
 I tried using M-: after embark-act as it could work as a workaround, but I didn&#x27;t find a way to make it ask me to edit the resulting expression either.
 Could someone nudge me in the right direction? An info how to force embark to show me an interactive prompt for some commands (like it already does OOTB for some) would be a nice bonus.
 EDIT: It seems the latter is possible by customizing embark-target-injection-hooks (link). I correctly remembered there was a variable directly controlling this behavior but it was removed since then, hence why I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.

                              <span>People seemed interested in the dnd evironment that i had setup for myself. So, I decided to separated it from my personal config and move it into separate repos. 
 The org file SRD
 The dnd-mode
 The documentation in these is lacking still, but I plan on adding more information about usage. Until then, if anyone would like to try it out they are welcome to ask questions to get up and running. Right now the mode has a dependency on &#x27;org-mode&#x27; and &#x27;yasnippet&#x27;. It is also expecting that the repos be cloned to your &#x27;~&#x27; directory by default (you can change it if you want).
 I do not currently have an examaple of a campaign, because I only have paid for campaigns setup for my personal. If anyone wants to provide a small campaign they made I would add it as an example, I sadly don&#x27;t have one at the ready right now, however. 
 Again, I am happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try it.

 Whenever I run &#x60;jupyter-notebook&#x60; in a terminal, it opens and works just fine in a web browser, but, whenever I try to open a &#x60;New Notebook&#x60; with EIN, I get this error?
 ​

Evaluating SKI combinators as native Haskell functions by Thomas Mahler
In this post I present an alternative approach to combinator-based implementation of functional languages that is significantly faster than classical graph-reduction based solutions.
Every Distributive is Representable by Daniel Mlot
At first glance, Distributive, the dual to Traversable, appears to have little if anything to do with Representable, the class for functors isomorphic to functions.

                              <span>The Ormolu project, led by Mark Karpov at Tweag, has been providing a reliable way to format Haskell source files for a few years now. It makes use of the parser of GHC itself, so as to prevent parsing issues that unfortunately some other Haskell formatters have.
Alexander Esgen detailed several improvements he made to Ormolu during his internship in a previous blog post. In turn, this blog post will be focusing on the challenge of formatting infix operator chains in Haskell, which is notoriously difficult and has been my primary goal for the last two months.

Operator chains
Almost all programming languages allow the use of infix operators, especially for the four basic numeric operators, +, -, * and /. Moreover, most of the time, these operators can be “chained” together without parenthe…</span>

                              <span>UPDATED: I have modified the example to remove any dependency on external packages.
 I must be misunderstanding something quite basic here, so I&#x27;ll ask this question in the hopes that someone can spot the error. I may have to dig deeper otherwise, but I&#x27;m somehow thinking the issue is fairly superficial and I&#x27;m just not seeing it. 
 Consider the following function: 
  (defun my/test-let-fun () (interactive) (let* ((var &quot;Hello&quot;)) (print var) (if (bound-and-true-p var) (print &quot;Yes.&quot;) (print &quot;No.&quot;)))) 
 I add this to my config, and the following happens when I call the function.
  
In the minibuffer, I see &quot;Hello.&quot; followed by &quot;No.&quot;
  
What I take from this is that (bound-and-true-p var) must be returning nil, since otherwise I should see &quot;Yes.&quot; So, I conclude: 
  
The variable var must either be unbound or have a nil value during the evaluation of the body of the let* expression.
 The variable var is bound to a non-nil value, since otherwise, I couldn&#x27;t get something other than nil as the output of (print var).
  
But these two things cannot be true together!
 Am I misinterpreting what&#x27;s going on? 
 If I am not, how can this be? Is there some other way to check if the value of a variable is non-nil? 
 Puzzlingly, if I define the function after starting Emacs (by calling eval-last-sexp, say), it works as I expect. (I see &quot;Hello&quot; followed by &quot;Yes.&quot;)

                              <span>Hi, I would appreciate advice about the following. I am currently using Embark, Consult, Orderless (and Marginalia).
 Desired action: I have a current buffer open that is &#x27;A&#x27;. I want to switch to a different buffer &#x27;B&#x27; (which may be anywhere), but I actually want to search buffer B and maybe copy some results over to the current buffer. This could be using consult-line or occur.
 How I am going about the above: 
  
switch buffer (consult-buffer) 
 
Hit embark-act on the desired buffer (bound to C-. as default)
 
Choose either C-s (embark-isearch) or C and l for consult-line 
 
However - the search chosen above always takes place on the current buffer A. I want to act on Buffer B that I chose in the minibuffer.
 
 My config for these packages is pretty vanilla, mostly borrowed off the README&#x27;s of these packages with some functions stolen from the authors of the packages.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have my packages be &#x27;fixed&#x27; to a specific version, and furthermore available via cloning my emacs git repository. The latter is a function of the fact that I sometimes work in (Windows) environments where emacs will seemingly not work under the proxy no matter what I try. That&#x27;s fine, in those environments I don&#x27;t really need emacs connecting to the internet.
 But then, what package strategy to use? The only one that seems to somewhat fit the bill is Borg: however,
  
It uses submodules, and I reaaaaally don&#x27;t want submodules. I&#x27;d much rather use subtrees to commit in particular packages.
 There is no dependency management via this route whatsoever. I&#x27;ve played around with epkg, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly good way of managing dependencies-of-dependencies, unless I&#x27;m missing something obvious?
  
Does anyone else have a subtree leveraging workflow and have a relatively sane way of figuring out package dependencies?

 I do some writing, and while my emacs WINDOW is full screen (I use a tiling window manager) I want the text to wrap at a given column, but only visually; I don&#x27;t want actual linefeeds there.
 Not even sure what to search for. I want something like &#x27;visual-line-mode&#x27; that respects the fill-column value.

                              <span>Running gnome 41.3 on a recent arch linux, and recent emacs git with pgtk and native-comp. I&#x27;m lately getting ^M characters before the line feed whenever I paste (that is, yank) from certain applications. I especially notice gnome-terminal, and pdf text content copied from evince. Google suggests it&#x27;s a text encoding issue, but I created a new buffer, confirmed that buffer-file-coding-system is set to utf-8-unix, and also checked that gnome-terminal encoding is set to utf-8 (don&#x27;t know how to check in evince).The problem still persists. Yank is of course written in C so I can&#x27;t run edebug on it, and anyway I wouldn&#x27;t really know what to look for. 
  
Any suggestions for how to track this down? It is relatively new, but I am not sure *exactly* how long it&#x27;s been going on.
 If I can&#x27;t fix it, shouldn&#x27;t I be able to somehow filter the text in the kill-ring so that the &quot;M&quot; characters are removed before being inserted?
  
Thanks everyone!

 I want to search the full text of the files for all the terms of the input (terms separated by spaces), no matter where in the file they are or in what order. 
 So, if I search for &quot;apple banana&quot;, I want to find a file where &quot;banana&quot; is on line 1 and &quot;apple&quot; is on line 15. Since pretty much all search tools are line-oriented and/or keep the order of the terms and/or use &#x27;OR&#x27; matching instead of &#x27;AND&#x27; matching, I came up with a way to do what I want via a series of pipes. Something like:
 rg --ignore-case --files-with-matches --color&#x3D;never --null . -e &#x27;apple&#x27; | xargs -0 rg --ignore-case --files-with-matches --color&#x3D;never -e &#x27;banana&#x27;

                              <span>I currently develop a little tool in which I would like to provide a temporarily visible help buffer containing cheat-sheet like content. And that content might be actually huge, so the user should be able to navigate the buffer.
 I plan to provide user options how and where that cheat-sheet might be shown (own frame, single windows with restoring current-window-configuration after close, side window left, right, top, bottom). My personal preference would be to open a new bottom window, as which-key does this for keybindings.
 The cheat-sheet mode would org, probably with a minor mode so that it is read only and can be closed with a single keystroke. I even think about using org-view-mode...
 Now my question is, what would be the best way to create and place the buffer? Shall I do it manually using basically split-window? Or is there something usable, probably the *Help*-buffers functionality as an official api? Or is it better to just create and show the buffer and let the user configure how to place it via display-buffer-alist?

                              <span>hi all,
 i have started using wucuo for spell checking. my configuration is pretty straightforward
 (use-package wucuo :ensure t :config ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; spell checking via &#x60;aspell&#x27; (setq ispell-program-name &quot;aspell&quot;) (setq ispell-extra-args &#x27;(&quot;--sug-mode&#x3D;ultra&quot; &quot;--lang&#x3D;en_US&quot; &quot;--run-together&quot; &quot;--run-together-limit&#x3D;16&quot;)) ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ;; disable spell checking in some major-modes (setq wucuo-spell-check-buffer-predicate (lambda () (not (memq major-mode &#x27;(dired-mode log-edit-mode compilation-mode help-mode profiler-report-mode speedbar-mode gud-mode calc-mode Info-mode))))) :hook (prog-mode . wucuo-start) (text-mode . wucuo-start) ) 
 this starts the spell checking as expected, and that works too. however, for source code buffers, i would like to run spell checker on comments only and not on the code itself. how do i do that ?

                              <span>Just started learning emacs (macport) about 10 days ago, Avy is the first package I&#x27;ve installed. So I have some questions.
 FIRST QUESTION Was there a particular reason for Oleh Krehel to suggest binding avy-goto-char to C-: instead of C-;? Since C-; doesn&#x27;t require the shift key, that would be seem to be a preferred binding for frequent navigation. (Perhaps colon C-; conflicts with some other popular binding?)
 SECOND ISSUE He suggests (from https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) possibly setting up default bindings using 
  
(avy-setup-default) 
  
But that doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. C-h b C-x o C-s avy fails to find anything.
 THIRD ISSUE [EDIT: ISSUE RESOLVED, THIS IS USED TO INTEGRATE AVY WITHIN AN ISEARCH.] Here&#x27;s a snippet from the documentation, I don&#x27;t understand this:
  
(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) &#x27;avy-resume)
 It will bind, for example, avy-isearch to C-&#x27; in isearch-mode-map, so that you can select one of the currently visible isearch candidates using avy.
  
How does binding to C-c C-j do anything to C-&#x27;? And what is isearch-mode-map? That function doesn&#x27;t seem to exist in my beginner level emacs. What does avy-resume do? I don&#x27;t understand any of this.
 FYI This is what I finally put into my .init.el file to get Avy to work:
 ;;; AVY BINDINGS https://github.com/abo-abo/avy ;; doesn&#x27;t seem to work ;;(avy-setup-default) ;; not sure what this does ;;(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) &#x27;avy-resume) ;; Suggested bindings from avy github docs (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-:&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char-2) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g f&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-line) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g w&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-1) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g e&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-0)

Edit: It is possible that I had some other packages installed than LSP related only, but I can&#x27;t tell because I just copy pasted few configs together, without thinking too much about it and hoping that it would work.
  
I remember having this neat feature which (among others) would allow me to expand macro by clicking on some text stating &quot;fix available&quot; which would pop up in the buffer itself, and i can&#x27;t get it to work. I do believe it had to do something with Flycheck package, but I might be wrong.
 It&#x27;s new feature, but very nice one: there is ref count displayed next to the function or variable declaration stating how many times this var/function h…</span>

It works in KDE plasma (kwin as compositor). I tried two compositors: xcompmgr and picom but nothing. Normal alpha parameter works fine.
 Anyone was able to make it work for EXWM?

                              <span>Does anyone have some elisp handy that scales latex previews along with text when using text-scale-adjust?
 I want to do this in both latex and org buffers, which use two different functions/features for this (preview-latex and org-latex-preview). If using dvipng (as opposed to to the dvisvgm method) I&#x27;m not looking to regenerate the previews at the new size, it&#x27;s OK if it stretches out the images when increasing the text scale.

 How do you review what you&#x27;ve worked on, what you have done etc?
 I&#x27;m aware of org-clock-report and maybe one day I&#x27;ll be disciplined enough to clock into everything. For now though all I&#x27;m managing to do is TODO -&gt; DONE. 
 So, do you do anything to summarize your weekly/etc tasks?

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure this has been answered a thousand times but I&#x27;m not easily finding the answer. 
 I just want to be able to look at my org-mode files from my phone or tablet. I don&#x27;t, right now, need to sync my agenda or anything like that -- mostly I just want to check my class notes and syllabus before I start reading to prep for lecture or seminar. 
 All my work files are synced via dropbox, so ideally it would be just a simple file reader that I can set so that org files &quot;open with&quot; that app from the dropbox app. Orgzly doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to do that, though it&#x27;s true that I can sync specific dropbox folders and access them from there. But mostly I&#x27;m going to be clicking on links, etc, rather than editing, and orgzly isn&#x27;t ideal for that. 
 So: anyone have a good solution? Thanks!

                              <span>Just wanted to take a moment to appreciate all that is Org-mode. I was a longtime vim user. My only emacs experience was an assembly course that I took many many years back that for some reason required it. Just over a year ago, I think, I started making a move to using org-mode for my to do lists. I started using templates and creating journal entries all in org. Then I moved into using org-roam for my notes at work and that morphed into using org-dailies and time tracking. With org-mode, I started moving all my ideas and things I wanted to remember, lists of books I&#x27;m reading or want to read. It goes on and on and it&#x27;s all organized in one nice neat (well, a little messy but relatively neat) little package. 
 Just wanted to share my appreciation for org-mode (and org-roam!) and for the community!

 So, for example, I have the expression case 1+2 of 3 -&gt; True
 What is the name for the expression 1+2? 
 I&#x27;ve seen it referred to as the scrutenee, but that&#x27;s long and kind of awkward. Is there a better name for this?

 I decided to create this open-source fork (with the author&#x27;s permission) to enable the Haskell community to participate in preserving and maintaining this awesome resource for future times. The idea behind the fork is to enable a way to submit and incorporate suggestions for edits and updates for LYAH from the community as Haskell evolves and changes. Additionally, it should be a zero-downtime version as in the past the original LYAH has had significant downtimes for long periods.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written out a description of a language construct for array traversals at https://github.com/andrewthad/journal/blob/master/entries/2022-02-08.md. If anyone has any feedback on this, I would be grateful. Or if there is any literature that&#x27;s related to this, it would be great to get pointers to it.

                              <span>My working method is similar to what @pgrhowarth has described here: In short, I always have to refer back to the original sources, in addition to my own ideas and conclusions. And this is not a personal choice, but a requirement of my profession.  But the &quot;output&quot; of a Zettelkasten, as far as I understand it, is a chain of associations of my own ideas, not some kind of source Wiki.
But I need both and more: on the one hand, I need to relate my sources to each other, i.e. &quot;who quoted whom&quot;, &quot;who learned from whom&quot;, &quot;who wrote letters with whom&quot;, etc and all based on the originals. On the other hand, I want to process my ideas and thoughts on quotations, excerpts, themes, etc. in a Zettelkasten. But beyond that, I need to make sure that my Zettel always refer to the sources from which they are inspired.
The question I have is: what is the best way to do this? Do I need two &quot;boxes&quot;, one for the verbatim quotes with sources and a proper Zettelkasten for my ideas? If so, how do I connect the two boxes? Or should I do &quot;double bookkeeping&quot; and always write the original quote and source on each Zettel?
To reiterate: I know how a wiki works, and I think I also know how to set up a Zettelkasten; what is not yet clear to me is how to connect these two systems.</span>

It pretty big number of people who left in such a short period of time. So does anyone know what is happening, would be nice even if someone from Lightbend can explain this if their employees are here on Reddit?

                              <span>Long time ago I came across a post on the internet (seemingly found in stackoverflow, but can&#x27;t find it now) that implements a breadth first search for a binary tree using map, flatten, flatMap. I try recall my memory, but I couldn&#x27;t remember how to implement that because I am not familiar with FP concepts. The part that I can remember ​ case class Node[T](v: T, left: Option[Node[T]]&#x3D;None, right: Option[Node[T]]&#x3D;Node) { def map[R](f: T &#x3D;&gt; R): R &#x3D; f(v) def flatten &#x3D; ... // flatten def flatMap &#x3D; ... // which combines map and flatten } But I can&#x27;t remember the part about flatten (the problem I suppose is I don&#x27;t know what I want to flatten for that ⠀Node object), and then flatMap. Any hint or suggestions on this? I suppose this can help me learn a lesson by implementing the code. Thanks

Since I wanna become proficient in it and eventually work coding in Haskell I want to ask you: - Is there any material you recommend for me to read/watch for making the transition from beginner to intermediate? - I&#x27;m mainly interested in data science and I learned about the existence of dhHaskell but I didn&#x27;t found any beginer friendly project for me to test. Is there any reository of examples to tinker and learn? (I&#x27;m painfully non creative when it comes to finding a project) (Edit posted this from my phone and mistakenly post it empty!)

                              <span>Background: I&#x27;m fairly new to Haskell, I can use the language but I am very unfamiliar with the overall build tooling. I largely just use what is recommended in my work project.
 So I got a new M1Pro. I&#x27;m the second on my team to do so. They were able to build everything just fine after some minor adjustments, but I have had problem after problem... and I&#x27;m stumped, so I&#x27;m turning to you for help.
 The project I&#x27;m trying to build is open source (https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). When I got this new system set up, I ran the instructions on our HACKING.md page and immediately tried to build. This failed because I didn&#x27;t have llvm installed, so I brew install llvm&#x27;d, symlinked into $PATH, and tried again. This failed due to:
 install_name_tool: error: unsupported load command (cmd&#x3D;0x80000034) &#x60;install_name_tool&#x27; failed in phase &#x60;Install Name Tool&#x27;. (Exit code: 1) 
 My teammate who has the M1 already and I compared notes, and he found that he had installed llvm@12. So I removed llvm and its $PATH symlink, installed llvm@12, installed its symlink, and now it compiles! Yay!
 ... But I can&#x27;t link. I&#x27;m now failing on this:
 Building library for byteorder-1.0.4.. [1 of 1] Compiling System.ByteOrder ( System/ByteOrder.hs, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.o, dist/build/System/ByteOrder.dyn_o ) ar: @/dist/build/objs-29886/ar29886-2.rsp: No such file or directory 
 We found a post where someone had a similar issue (here), but the fix in that issue doesn&#x27;t help: using ar from binutils causes link errors like this instead:
 Linking dist/build/hspec-discover/hspec-discover ... ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/kit/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/hspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40/lib/libHShspc-dscvr-2.8.5-ab243a40.a, building for macOS-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for macOS-arm64 
 So I&#x27;m kinda lost at this point and hoping someone has tips. If you read this far, thanks for your time!

Does it mean that an instance of Monad is also an instance of Applicative? I was wondering how to see an instance of Monad is an instance of Applicative? Can  of Applicative be rewritten in terms of &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and return of Monad?
 
Is an instance of Monad also an instance of Functor? Can fmap of Functor be rewritten in terms of &gt;&gt;&#x3D; and return of Monad?
 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to get into Functional Programming, and I really like all the things I read about Haskell as a language, but I&#x27;m being driven to find something else almost entirely by what I can find about cabal. Like, I can&#x27;t uninstall a package? Really?
 Although most posts about &quot;cabal hell&quot; seem to be almost a decade old I can&#x27;t really find if anything has changed to abolish it. The closest I&#x27;ve read is someone somewhere mentioning Nix as an alternative to Cabal; is that Nix as in NixOS? Are people really using a system package manager to manage their Haskell packages, or have I completely missed the point? Separate from Nix, is Cabal good now or should I stay away?

 I&#x27;d like to remove comments in a minified css stylesheet, and to do so, I&#x27;m curling the stylesheet and trying to regex replace the comments with \/\*(.|\n)*?\*\/; however, while it works with a regex tester, it doesn&#x27;t work in replace-regexp-in-string. I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to escape the \*, the brackets, and the newline character, but is there any way to escape whatever is needed, without me having to remember to translate a regular regexp to an elisp regexp?
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                              <span>I have setup Emacs in WSL2, and it starts up flawlessly. Now I want to link the Emacs to .txt so that when I click on the txt file, Emacs (of WLS2) will open it for me. I know another option is to install Emacs for windows, but it&#x27;s very slow. I would like to use a method to open windows files using Emacs in WSL2. Thanks guys!

                              <span>What exactly is the difference between the auto-save-list directory that is always generated by default in .emacs.d and the the auto-save directory that we typically want to change by using the auto-save-file-name-transforms function? the latter, by default uses the temporary-file-directory, which is typically the local machine&#x27;s /tmp/ folder. both are for auto-save files? but what exactly are the difference though? the auto-save-list directory holds auto-save file of the &quot;STATE&quot; of your emacs? and has the save.hostname files for when the system unexpectedly crashes and you want to RECOVER your emacs to the previous state? and the auto-save-file-name-transforms/temporary-file-directory holds the #BLAH# files of the file you&#x27;re currently working on and saved at a regular interval?
 Question regarding where to place (package-refresh-contents)
  
 (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) 
 (package-refresh-contents) 
 (package-install &#x27;use-package))
  
currently i have this... but in this, (package-refresh-contents) will basically only ran once EVER - during the initial setup, since that&#x27;s the only time the system will not have use-package installed. should i perhaps place that line before (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package)? so that it is run everytime when i start up emacs? there&#x27;s pros and cons to this right? the pro is that, the package cache/info will be up to date everytime and i can just install packages right away through the commands as the package repos will be all up to date already... the cons is that, i doing so, it will dramatically slow down the startup time &#x27;cuz emacs will spend a lot of time updating the package cache right? and this is probably not worth it since we typically want to run package-list-package interactively anyway when we want to look for packages interactively and it will update the cache at that time anyway

                              <span>I am running evil in Emacs, and use the leader key extensively. 
 I have set Space as evil-leader and assigned a key to it as follows:
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal my-intercept-mode-map (kbd &quot;SPC&quot;) &#x27;evil-send-leader) (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;a&quot;) &#x27;my/foo-bar) 
 When I run describe-key followed by SPC a, I would it to take me to my/foo-bar. Instead it takes me to evil-send-leader.
 How can I have describe-key SPC a take me to my/foo-bar?
 In Doom Emacs this worked, but running my own config I cannot find how to get this to work. 
 TIA!

                              <span>My OCD would really need a package where I can indent lists and similar structures with leading commas, i.e. /a la/ Haskell style, like in c
 c enum What { IN , THE , BUT } 
 or in python lists python a &#x3D; [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] 
 I thought before I set myself into the indentation rabbit hole, maybe someone knows a package or a sipmle setting to set. Up to now I have been using from time to time haskell-indentation-mode but sometimes it screws some other indentation in the relevant programming language and I would really only &quot;need it&quot; for some comma separated special cases.

 I&#x27;d like to enter the Emacs (and Org-mode) world.
 I own a Mac and I&#x27;m confused.
 I see I can download Emacs by using Home-brew, but also from this link: https://emacsformacosx.com
 Are they the same version?
 Please consider I&#x27;d like to install Org-mode too.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I read here that defvar only sets the value of a variable if it doesn&#x27;t already have a value. 
 Then I tried to test it in scratch buffer, but could not verify that. defvar always sets the value no matter what. 
 Did some googling, found some stackover flow answers stating the same. 
 Got quite confused for quite some time. 
 Then decided to read elisp mannal, found this: 
  When you evaluate a top-level ‘defvar’ form with ‘C-M-x’ (‘eval-defun’) or with ‘C-x C-e’ (‘eval-last-sexp’) in Emacs Lisp mode, a special feature of these two commands arranges to set the variable unconditionally, without testing whether its value is void. 
 relieved. Isn&#x27;t this a bit strange? That it doesn&#x27;t work the same way when you want to test it out by C-x C-e

                              <span>Dear org-mode-users, 
 I have a question regarding Python sessions in org-babel (started with the :session header-argument): What are your reasons -- if there are any at all -- to switch to a full-fledged Jupyter/Ipython-notebook, e.g. emacs-jupyter? I am wondering when to use which tool. 
 Thanks!
