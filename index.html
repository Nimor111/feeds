                              <span>Seems as if one wants to learn lisp, one has to learn emacs first. That said, I am looking for resources for the absolute beginner to learn emacs, looking for something along the lines of Common lisp A gentle introduction to symbolic computation., but for emacs. Something that assumes you know nothing, starts at the absolute beginningwith lots of exercise and answer to those exercise. Any help will be appreciated. 
 Thanks
 For the record I have been through search, but the signal to noise ratio is pretty high.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested to know what the future of remove development with emacs might look like. I&#x27;m a long time emacs user, and use rust, lsp-mode, magit and projectile heavily. The remote experience with tramp just isn&#x27;t very good. I&#x27;ve had to work around several bugs that lead to hangs, and even though I&#x27;m only ~20millis away from my remote machine performance is pretty bad. I believe I&#x27;ve already done everything I can to make it fast (ssh control master, etc.), and I&#x27;m still not happy. On the other hand, VSCode (which I&#x27;m not familiar with) or IntelliJ make remote development a breeze. I really like how they hide latency, and handle reconnects well. I&#x27;ve also tried terminal emacs on the remote machine, but I just can&#x27;t deal with the input lag.
 It&#x27;s remarkable how emacs has been able to adapt over the years, and so I&#x27;m interested to hear about some ideas to keep emacs relevant for this usecase.

                              <span>I&#x27;m seriously considering buying an M2 MacBook, after over 20 years on Linux. My main concern is whether it will be difficult to set up Emacs after such a long-term investment in my init files. I would love to hear from others who have made the same transition -- was it hard? Do you have tips to make it easier? 
 Thanks in advance!

 My story:
 Evil: I came to Emacs after a long time of using Vim. Everyone told me to just use Evil and be done with it. I tried Devil but I dont know what it is about it that it left me dissatisfied. There was this feeling that I need to learn Emacs way of doing things. Because all documentation or tutorials I get have Emacs keys. Virtually none of them tell how to do same things in Evil. Always felt like an outsider. Jokes like C-x M-c M-butterfly made me feel like I am not in on the joke because I use Evil. I wanted to learn the Emacs way.
 Pure Emacs: So I uninstalled Evil and went all in to pure Emacs keys. I learnt them quickly but key chords always felt difficult on my fingers. Then I found God mode and Devil…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I recently did &quot;something&quot; in an emacs buffer and lost a bunch of text in different places, and I was unable to undo the deletions. I tried to use ediff (I guess I should have used ediff-backup?) to recover the lost text but not being competent I mixed up buffers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and ended up copying the deletions to the backup file and couldn&#x27;t recover from there .... :-).
 Now I am curious if there are recent &#x27;best practices&#x27; to 
  
Avoid doing &#x27;something&#x27; that causes text to disappear
 Have a more robust, for a beginner like me, set of autosave and associated settings.

                              <span>Hi! Seaman Emacs is my attempt at a literate, modular (module-layer), extensible Emacs configuration.
 Seaman makes it easy to add new packages or combinations of packages to your config and safely test them out, as well as phasing out unused packages and remove bloat from your config. Lastly, all source code is easily navigable and documented, with a single .org file in charge of running the show.
 If you use Emacs 29 it&#x27;s super easy to try it out with --init-directory !
 I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback/suggestions/contributions a lot :)
 https://github.com/alopezrivera/Seaman-Emacs/
 Design choices:
  
Source: seaman.org contains is the source of all modules and layers. All source files are asynchronously tangled when saving. config.org contains the source code of your (in this case my) config. All blocks inside are asynchronously tangled to init.el when saving
 Package manager: straight.el
 Key bindings: Emacs + custom
  
Out of the box:
  
Clean UI
 Homescreen
 Easy theme switching (light/dark)
 &quot;Full pack&quot; Org Mode with org-agenda, org-calendar, org-roam etc.
 &quot;Full pack&quot; PDF support with pdf-tools (highlighting, etc.)
 Magit for VC
  
Example config:
 My personal config built with Seaman is here:

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting interested in learning Haskell, and I&#x27;m trying to find a good first project to really sink my teeth into. Like the title says, I&#x27;m mainly targeting scientific applications -- nothing fancy right now, mostly just diagonalizing some matrices and numerical integration -- and I&#x27;m looking for some good libraries to use.
 I&#x27;ve already done a bit of searching on Hackage, but I&#x27;m mainly interested here in what people would recommend for N-dimensional arrays and matrix diagonalization. What&#x27;s the general feeling on HMatrix?
 I guess I should also mention that I&#x27;m coming from a Python+Rust background, where my workflow was to do all the heavy lifting in Rust, serialize the data to a npy/npz file, and then do all the plotting in Python with matplotlib. One thing I haven&#x27;t found on Hackage is something to handle the serialization step -- ideally, I&#x27;d like to take an HMatrix object (or some other equivalent) and just call a function to write it to a file. Does anyone know of a good solution for that? Otherwise, what are some nice, ergonomic (preferably matplotlib-like) plotting libraries?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, please bear with me as my core talents are not in programming but I’m interested in learning Haskell and generally inspired by the project and community.
 I have two projects in mind. One is to build a user friendly app on the web for general budgeting, and for more advanced cases; financial modelling and business use. This is a product idea, but my heart is really in number theory and various applied areas of mathematics. So second idea is to build a function library for a similar calculator catering to that. I know there’s good stuff out there but partly it is to develop my skills and understanding. 
 Is Haskell suitable for this? Would it be unwise to try hit two birds at once and just have a common library? Or should I keep the product idea seperate and use a more commonly understood language like python? Much thanks in advance!

In the case of the Scala standard library, I only receive a message stating &quot;No information available&quot; (as shown in screenshot 3). Have you ever encountered this situation, or is there something I might be overlooking?

 screenshot 2: hover on std library

                              <span>Hey all - just throwing this out to see if anyone understands what is going on in the industry? At this time last year after my contract ran out recruiters were knocking down my door trying to get my 10+ years of functional Scala experience to one of their many clients that wanted it. This year after a similar situation I am being rejected by 9/10 applications off the rip and those I have gotten an interview with have either ghosted or rejected and my previous recruiters have nothing in their pipelines. Now I know there are several variables that could be at play but I can&#x27;t remember ever having such bad luck in my entire career at least getting in the door somewhere. Does anyone have any advice, commiseration or burning desire to team up and start a consulting company?

An alternative frontend for Haskell? by gilmi
In this post I’ll explore 11 ideas I would pursue if I were to build an alternative syntax for Haskell (a new compiler frontend for a modified language that compiles to GHC Haskell source code) to solve some of the most repeated complaints about Haskell.

In this blog post,
we will learn how to include Bayesian machine learning in a reactive rhine application.
Imagine a program that reacts in real time to a sensor input:
It might be a robot, an app using GPS data on a phone,
or a device to track an object’s location.
Also assume that we have some prior knowledge about how this data is produced,
so it makes sense to express this knowledge as a Bayesian model,
and use Bayesian machine learning to infer the best estimate of the state of the robot, phone, or object.
Then our program should be able to react continuously in real time to this estimate.
There exist numerous libraries for Bayesian modelling and inference, such as Stan, PyMC, and (in Haskell) monad-bayes,
but it is not straightforw…</span>

 Has anyone done something similar?

                              <span>I just configured eglot for C++ using clangd, and my eldoc buffers include some spurious characters rendered as two highlighted underscores after each symbol ( e.g., &quot;Foo__&quot;): https://i.imgur.com/Snqt9JA.png
 If I copy them to another buffer, they turn out to be a backtick followed by two spaces: &quot;&#x60; &quot;.
 Does anybody know how to get rid of them?
 I tried downloading the latest eglot (rather than using the one that comes with Emacs 29) and setting &#x27;eglot-prefer-plaintext&#x27; to &#x27;t&#x27;, but this got rid of all syntax highlighting.

                              <span>In my quest to create a personalized note-taking system, I chose to use Emacs. While I&#x27;m aware of various existing packages like roam, zk, and org-journal, I wanted a solution that precisely catered to my needs, without unnecessary features or the loss of essential ones. This drove me back to Emacs from Logseq, as I realized I only required a simple system for taking daily notes.
 With that in mind, I crafted a configuration to facilitate note-taking and accomplished a feature I had long desired: integration with Raindrop to fetch my bookmarks. Surprisingly, it was a straightforward process.
 This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the versatility of Emacs, allowing it to be tailored to meet one&#x27;s unique requirements. I&#x27;m now fully immersed in the world of Emacs.
 Feel free to take a look at my configuration and offer any tips, code suggestions, or ideas on how to further enhance, simplify, or expand it. You can find the configuration here:

Every once in a while, it&#x27;ll get &quot;out of sync&quot; from the buffer. i.e. even after I correct the syntax error it reports, it still sends the old code to LSP, and therefore keeps reporting the fixed errors.
 &#x60;elgot-reconnect&#x60; fixes it, but it&#x27;s really not a solution to call &#x60;eglot-reconnect&#x60; every 10 minutes.

                              <span>Hey friends! I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs and have vc-gutter enabled. When I make changes, a single character (for example &#x3D; pops up on the left side of the line numbers. This has the effect of shifting the line numbers and all content of the buffer to the right. Ideally, I&#x27;d just like the column to ALWAYS be present even if there are no changes. I tried modifying multiple variables, but I believe all the fringe ones are for graphical. Does anyone have guidance? Thanks! 
 Update: git-gutter:hide-gutter is already set to nil and it doesn&#x27;t seem to preserve that column.

                              <span>Hello to all, As some of you probably did, i jumped on the treesitter train with emacs 29.1.
 I replaced my major modes by their ts counterparts, and gave it a try. For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. 
 Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules. I have used mainly the following so far : - cmake-ts-mode - c++-ts-mode - yaml-ts-mode
 Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or &quot;fix&quot; indentation rules to my liking.
 On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily
 On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. 
 I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze. 
 How has your treesitter Journey been so far ?

 I would like to simplify my file and use variables for some file locations (using a variable in agenda section, etc).
 What is the right way to do that in lisp?
 Is it as simple as this?
 (setq win-file-location &#x27;(&quot;c:/Users/Username/Desktop/filename.org&quot;))
 (setq linux-file-location &#x27;(&quot;/home/username/Desktop/filename.org&quot;))

 I have read (but not tested it yet) that logseq has a module to browse or search in the Discogs DB, and I thought &quot;pffff.... emacs has it for years already&quot;... but I hardly find anything on this topic.
 I have found an old project on github from Mineo regarding Musicbrainzm but I was expecting more.
 Is there any reason for this lack of solutions?
 I am no developer, I am not complaining, but I am surprised, this is probably the first domain where I can not find a good solution for my needs with emacs (I may also have poorly searched, would it be the case, please show me the path to the truth!!!!) 
 Any idea why? Thx for your insights!

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Does anyone know if there is a plugin for Emacs that offers like a popup where you search recent files.
 Right now I use counsel and it works in minibuffer below...but I saw a video where you could have that working like a mid-screen popup and search files.

                              <span>Is there a way I can compile then run my compiled application, if its already running then exit recompile and run.
 So current work flow is compile switch to terminal run binary, switch back make changes compile return to terminal Ctrl + C to kill then run again, be nice if I could do all this from inside emacs.
 I guess a bash script could be an option but curious if others have this work flow and how it works ?
 Currently in a golang workflow but even better if there is a generic solution.

                              <span>I use Consult, Vertico and orderless in my config. But when I am looking for a file (consult-ls-git) I would like it not to include subpath or the path when filtering the results, or if it&#x27;s possible to show matches in filename first - so they have more score for the sorting. Is this possible. 
 /LoginView/SomeFile.swift
 /LoginView/LoginView.swift 
 Right now I would get this when I type &quot;Login&quot;, that fine but if it&#x27;s not possible to exclude non matching files, I would like the LoginView to be the first choice.

 but I rather have everything hapenning in one go, using the q letter for this. (lazyvim sems to have that setup by default which i seems to have got used to it)
 It&#x27;s easy enough to redefine an object like this:
 (define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map &quot;q&quot; &#x27;evil-a-double-quote) (define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map &quot;q&quot; &#x27;evil-inner-double-quote) 
 which obviously only select the double quotes, anyone would know how to extend this to backquote &#x60; or single quote &#x27;

                              <span>I don&#x27;t want to create 2 extra endpoints because otherwise it would be an API change (to the outside). 
 What I want is to have an endpoint that if it optionally gets a header Accept -&gt; text/event-stream, it executes logic A, otherwise logic B.
 Anyone have any ideas, thanks in advance.
 scala // with optional header &quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;text/event-stream&quot; // real stream with single datapoints def a &#x3D; endpoint .post .in(&quot;data&quot;) .in(clientIp) .in(pathBindables) .in(jsonBody[DataQuery]) .errorOut(stringBody) .out(serverSentEventsBody[IO]) 
 scala def b &#x3D; endpoint .post .in(&quot;data&quot;) .in(clientIp) .in(pathBindables) .in(jsonBody[DataQuery]) .errorOut(jsonBody[ErrorMessage]) .out(streamBody(Fs2Streams[IO])(sttp.tapir.Schema.any[Stream[IO, Byte]], CodecFormat.Json.apply()))

                              <span>Hi ! 
 I am looking for a working example of an import of a package from Github Packages Maven repository using scala-cli. 
 My use case would be to import libs shared internally in my company org. And if I get it working for private packages, then it should work for public ones too ! 
 Currently I have :
 scala-cli config --dump
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json
 { &quot;repositories&quot;: { &quot;credentials&quot;: [{&quot;host&quot;:&quot;https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;value:PrivateToken&quot;,&quot;password&quot;:&quot;env:GITHUB_TOKEN&quot;,&quot;matchHost&quot;:true}]
 } }
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and the following using directives 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; //&gt; using repository &quot;https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG&quot; //&gt; using lib &quot;my.org::my-lib:0.1.0&quot;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 which yields an unauthorized error on import.
 I also tried setting the repositories.credential.host to maven.pkg.github.com and maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG without success. 
 As for the repository in the using directive I have also tried ( not sure if I tried every combination of both ): - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/_ - https://maven.pkg.github.com/MY_ORG/REPO_OF_MY_LIB
 I am sure the token works. The unauthorized error seem to indicate either the crednetials are not passed or I am targeting the wrong URLs. Any idea on what&#x27;s wrong with my setup ?

                              <span>Slipped in between paragraphs about being worried that her family&#x27;s hiding place will be discovered by a new building owner and the fairness of rationing butter, Anne Frank mentions being gifted a zettelkasten to track her reading:

  
Father emptied a card file for Margot and me and filled it with index cards that are blank on one side. This is to become our reading file, in which Margot and I are supposed to note down the books we’ve read, the author and the date.


Niklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927-1998), famous for his own 90,000+ slip reading file, was a year and a half older than Anne Frank (June 12, 1929-1945) who received her first card index file in February 1943 (likely between the 27th, the date of her diary entry mentioning it and the prior diary entry on February 5th). It was given to her by her father at the age of 13. As would have been commonplace, she was intended to use it as a &quot;reading file&quot; to note down the books she&#x27;d read along with the author and the date.
One can only wonder at how many entries she would have made over the span of her life had it not come to such an abrupt end.

                              <span>It would be really nice to have everything in org mode, but I continually find myself coming back to planning with paper for all but the toy cases.
 It would be really nice, as a Computer Person, to have all of my notes and project management in a computer system. For instance, I have to manage my work sprints using Linear. But I find that org mode, and to some extent emacs, has too much friction for my liking.
 In the first place, it is not trivial to use with a mobile phone. Right now I have an emacs instance running inside termux, and notes have to be ported over with Syncthing. This necessitates (at least ideally) running a spare machine 24/7 to sync with. Not to mention that using my smartphone probably increases my risk of cancer at least slightly.
 If I have to write something down, I&#x27;m reluctant to open a new emacs window, navigate to my buffer, and then write down the point.
 Also, the default org-agenda views are much inferior to the typical calendar or timetable.
 Sorry for the emotional nature of this post. I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anybody was in a similar place, and where they ended up going.

                              <span>Some context: I&#x27;m a Java programmer, but I don&#x27;t like it. I have a background in mathematics so naturally I am interested in (pure) functional programming. At my dayjob, I have expressed my feelings towards Java and expressed I would like to do something more &quot;mathematically motivated&quot; and coined Scala and their effect systems as examples. My teamlead, who himself is a developer, wanted me to give him a bit more of an explanation of what I meant by this, so I set out to gather some information I can present to him.
 But
 I am confused as to how I can unite the following two descriptions of effects:
  
Rob Norris in his talk &#x27;Functional Programming with Effects&#x27; talks about mathematical functions and then talks about effects as basically ways to be able to do the stuff we&#x27;re used to in programming like functions not being total, mutability, ... He then talks about the 6 most known &#x27;effects&#x27; and wants to be able to compose them, then concludes that basically an effect is an &#x60;F[_]&#x60; which is a Monad.
 Cats-Effect, from the docs says that their typeclass hierarchy describe, fundamentally, what it means to be a functional effect. But their typeclass hierarchy is for their specific runtime and focusses almost exclusively on asynchrony, parallelism and concurrency. I don&#x27;t see &#x60;Option&#x60; or &#x60;Either&#x60; fitting in here.
  
So what gives? I am really confused at this point, but I would really appreciate if someone could shed some light on this. 
 Bonus question: In the same talk, Rob Norris says that there are a lot of other effects out there. How do I find them? This sounds silly, but does he just mean like &quot;custom monads&quot; that we might define in our business which are only applicable in our custom business environment, or does he mean more powerful abstractions which are just more complex than the ones he showed?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying out Eat today. I&#x27;m currently pretty happy with my Eshell setup. I love being able to use Corfu + Orderless for basic completions in Eshell. I was wondering: could I get some of that magic with Eat? How do you use Eat?

                              <span>Does anybody have a good resource about emacs29 tree-sitter indentation? In particular I&#x27;m interested on not indenting inside namespaces for C/C++ styles.
 With cc-mode this works: (c-set-offset &#x27;innamespace [0]), for example.
 This is what I have so far that, of course, it is not working:
 &#x60;&#x60; (use-package c++-ts-mode :ensure nil ;; emacs built-in :preface (defun my/c-ts-indent-style() (;; do not indent namespace children ((parent-is &quot;namespace_definition&quot;) parent-bol 0)
  ;; append to bsd style ,@(alist-get &#x27;bsd (c-ts-mode--indent-styles &#x27;cpp)))) :bind (:map c++-ts-mode-map (&quot;M-&quot; . treesit-beginning-of-defun) (&quot;M-&quot; . treesit-end-of-defun)) :config (setq c-ts-mode-indent-offset 4) (setq c-ts-mode-indent-style #&#x27;my/c-ts-indent-style)) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 SOLUTION: In another thread my question was answered, here&#x27;s the link to that thread if anybody is interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16zhgrd/comment/k4aw2yi/?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3

I have been facing this friction when i want to switch editors from vim (neovim ) to emacs that i am very accustom to my keybinds in vim and i use those binds everywhere possible in my browser in pycharm , c lion , vs code if i ever have to use that Question i want to ask is this : if i use vim bindings inside emacs (i heard that you can do that and that made me want to try emacs) how far can i go before i hit the limit of what&#x27;s possible using emacs , will i have to switch back and learn normal emacs key bindings to use advanced features and configure it to my liking is there a hard limit to the customizations you can do with vim bindings this may seem like a stupid question but this thought of keep using vim bindings in emacs and then having to relearn all of the muscle memory again is keeping me from trying it , but i want to use something like emacs for my personal development all the time for now on to forever it is advisable to use emacs on windows system or should i get started with it inside my Wsl system any recommendations, suggestions , roadmap to learn emcas better and efficiently is very well appreciated ,any links to videos articles blogs and resources for learning are appreciated as well

                              <span>If you would have the power to change any Emacs-default setting, what would that be and why?
 What kind of setting do you think would be useful for a lot (or a majority) of Emacs-users?
 One of my examples:
 (fido-vertical-mode t)
 Because seeing a list of candidates as you type and being able to choose from it with meaningful key-bindings is way more convenient and efficient than the tab-completion-system (I think this claim is backed by the way all those external packages work; helm, ivy, vertico). This is especially suited for a default because you can still use the tab-completion-system with it. So nobody needs to change habits.

 I just fired up magit to merge my dev branch into master, and somehow the keys have changed or are not working. I used to hit &quot;b l&quot; to checkout a local branch (in this case master) where I&#x27;d then merge dev into it, push it to github, and then checkout out dev again.
 I get this message:-
 ​
  
&quot;transient-setup: Suffix magit-branch.
.merge/remote is not defined or autoloaded as a command&quot;
  
Hopefully someone here has recently done the slog and can save this lazy individual some time. What changed? I havent touched my magit setup for literally years.
 (magit-checkout from minibuffer works fine).

                              <span>In this post I share a basic model built in Haskell to help plan for education expenses (or other large, future, time-bounded expenses).
 This beginner-friendly post demonstrates many simple Haskell functions, especially for working with lists. It also shows how to build and execute stateful computations using State
 from mtl. I (mostly) avoid type signatures and just focus on defining the terms, but there are plenty of links to API documentation. At the end of the post I suggest some enhancements to the model that would be good exercises for learners (and might be fun even for more experienced Haskell programmers).

                              <span>I periodically run an emacs batch command using (org-store-agenda-views) to generate plain text and html versions of my org-agenda. This process works fine generally.
 However, some of my TODO headlines contain org-formatted links (i.e. within the headline). In both the .txt and .html generated files, these links appear with the full text of the org link - i.e. with [[link destination][link title]] visible in the generated/viewed file - rather than just &#x27;link title&#x27;.
 Is this expected behaviour? Are there any settings that affect this behaviour? I would prefer not to see the full org link source in the generated files.
 (I&#x27;m currently running org version 9.6.10 and emacs 29.1 on Linux. When I first started generating these agenda files, the links in headlines exported correctly. I suspect that the current behaviour began after an org version upgrade, but I cannot remember which one, and have just been living with it since.)

 *(p2+1)&#x3D;&#x27;e&#x27;; 
 end up w/ preceding commas. I&#x27;ve tried w/ emacs -q and I have the same issue. Is there any short term fix for this?
 ​
 UPDATE
 I realize now this is a quoting mechanism to prevent confusion inside an org document, and that this should not be removed. Instead is there a good way to font lock these commas so that they are barely visible?

I have this installed from Melba and when I do any sort of docker list commands images, containers etc the buffer opens with the correct headers but no content. I can run docker ps just fine on a term and get results, I’m in the docker group so no audio or root required. I have removed any options relating to docker from my init.el. Any thoughts on how I can debug this?

                              <span>In deadgrep, I&#x27;m having a hard time using the glob option to exclude files. Using rg globs, I can do something like rg Foo -g &#x27;!gtest*cpp&#x27; to exclude all of my gtest files.
 In deadgrep, the same glob filter, !gtest*cpp returns NO results. If I remove the exclude, !, I ONLY get gtest*cpp results.
 Does deadgrep handle excluding glob patterns differently?

                              <span>Hi fellow r/emacs ers,
 I am trying to have fzf working under windows 10 in emacs. So far, calling it with M-x only show errors:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Spawning child process&quot; &quot;Invalid argument&quot;) make-process(:name &quot;fzf&quot; :buffer # :command (&quot;/bin/sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;stty -nl echo rows 20 columns 80 sane 2&gt;NUL;if [ $...&quot; &quot;..&quot; &quot;sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) start-process(&quot;fzf&quot; # &quot;/bin/sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;stty -nl echo rows 20 columns 80 sane 2&gt;NUL;if [ $...&quot; &quot;..&quot; &quot;sh&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;) term-exec-1(&quot;fzf&quot; # &quot;sh&quot; (&quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) term-exec(# &quot;fzf&quot; &quot;sh&quot; nil (&quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;)) make-term(&quot;fzf&quot; &quot;sh&quot; nil &quot;-c&quot; &quot;fzf -x --color bw --print-query --margin&#x3D;1,0 --no-...&quot;) fzf--start(nil fzf--action-find-file) fzf(nil) funcall-interactively(fzf nil) command-execute(fzf record) execute-extended-command(nil &quot;fzf&quot; #(&quot;fzf&quot; 0 3 (face (nano-strong nano-salient)))) funcall-interactively(execute-extended-command nil &quot;fzf&quot; #(&quot;fzf&quot; 0 3 (face (nano-strong nano-salient)))) command-execute(execute-extended-command)  I do not know why /bin/sh is called
 I have Msys64 installed, fzf works in my terminal. I also have bash.exe working fine.
 In emacs, I have modified these variables in order to have bash.exe called instead of /bin/sh
  
sh-shell is set to bash
 sh-shell-file is set to the path to bash.exe
  
I have also search for mentions of /bin/sh using deadgrep... nothing useful. I do not know what to do.
 please help me fix this problem. thx

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am a big user of GMail&#x27;s &quot;Scheduled Send&quot; feature. It allows me to reply at my pace and make sure the thread does not become a ping-pong match and replies won&#x27;t come back earlier than expected.
 How to do that &quot;on my own&quot;? I use notmuch + msmtp (within emacs) to handle most of my email but like half of it I have to manage via Gmail&#x27;s web interface because of the scheduling needs.
 I know about msmtp-queue but it is a all or nothing solution. I would love to be able to schedule my emails, either at Emacs level or SMTP level, with some header or something.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Has anyone been able to get xwidget-webkit to work under Wayland? I saw that support for pgtk was added a couple of years ago so I decided to give it a whirl. Compiled emacs 29.1 on Linux x86_64 with webkit2gtk-2.42.1 and the configure options &#x60;--with-xwidgets&#x60; and &#x60;--with-pgtk&#x60;. I tried opening a url with &#x60;xwidget-webkit-browse-url&#x60;, but emacs crashed with the error:
 &quot;ERROR **: 12:43:15.326: GDK is not able to create a GL context: The current backend does not support OpenGL.&quot;
 which is weird, because &#x60;eglinfo&#x60; does not report anything out of the ordinary. 
 xwidgets has always been finicky for me and there&#x27;s very little information available on the internet so I&#x27;d be interested in knowing if others have got it to work and it&#x27;s just a problem with my setup.

 #+begin_src gnuplot :export both :results output $data &lt;&lt; EOD 140 492 150 482 160 474 EOD f(x) &#x3D; m*x + b fit f(x) $data using 1:2 via m,b #+end_src #+RESULTS: 
 No result is shown.
 If I type this into gnuplot directly I get following output
 iter chisq delta/lim lambda m b 0 3.3073100000e+05 0.00e+00 1.06e+02 1.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 1 1.0051585134e+04 -3.19e+06 1.06e+01 2.884742e+00 1.013012e+00 2 3.3702517596e+03 -1.98e+05 1.06e+00 3.198022e+00 1.063524e+00 3 3.3179216992e+03 -1.58e+03 1.06e-01 3.166605e+00 5.868544e+00 4 1.0413329062e+03 -2.19e+05 1.06e-02 1.377710e+00 2.749980e+02 5 8.3116008254e-01 -1.25e+08 1.06e-03 -8.713637e-01 6.133585e+02 6 6.6666666933e-01 -2.47e+04 1.06e-04 -8.999964e-01 6.176661e+02 7 6.6666666667e-01 -4.00e-04 1.06e-05 -9.000000e-01 6.176667e+02 iter chisq delta/lim lambda m b After 7 iterations the fit converged. final sum of squares of residuals : 0.666667 rel. change during last iteration : -3.9991e-09 degrees of freedom (FIT_NDF) : 1 rms of residuals (FIT_STDFIT) &#x3D; sqrt(WSSR/ndf) : 0.816497 variance of residuals (reduced chisquare) &#x3D; WSSR/ndf : 0.666667 Final set of parameters Asymptotic Standard Error &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; m &#x3D; -0.9 +/- 0.05774 (6.415%) b &#x3D; 617.667 +/- 8.673 (1.404%) correlation matrix of the fit parameters: m b m 1.000 b -0.999 1.000 
 which I would like to see directly inside of the org file. 
 Has anybody an idea, what I am doing wrong?

                              <span>I use org-roam-bibtex to manage bibliography notes, and use org-roam capture templates to create roam nodes associated with each reference in my bibliography.
 The org-roam-bibtex context allows for access to some bibliography entry fields like the path to the PDF file on my system. I&#x27;d like to org-attach this PDF to a heading that expands in the org-capture template while retaining the option :immediate-finish t. Is this a possibility?

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t developed or even looked at the source code of either. So I suppose I&#x27;m asking those who have.
 IntelliJ&#x27;s Scala plugin really doesn&#x27;t work too well. I really like IntelliJ&#x27;s IDEA, but it&#x27;s substantially harder to debug Scala 3 in my experience.
 I&#x27;m aware there are LSP servers for IntelliJ. How outlandish would it be use Metals in IntelliJ?
 (I&#x27;m asking out of curiosity, even if I could, I&#x27;m more of a VSCode user)

Ideas I&#x27;m thinking about:
Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics
OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT as writing tutor
Should I quit? It would free me to switch to a more worthy, interesting opportunity. Something more in line with my goals.
Do I know what it means to write for the benefit of others?
Interstitial Journaling
The Indian Monk Tilopa&#x27;s Six Nails and how they relate to mindfulness.
I&#x27;m thinking about the tension between what is easy, fun, and comfortable and what adds value to my life.
How do I physically review my ZK notes and journal entries? How do I make sense of this process? How do I connect with what is valuable in this process?
The ephemerality of thought.
Self-mentoring.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Emerson, Hannah and Martin, Chris and Nisinzweig, Aviv. The kissing of kissing: poems. 2022.
Davis, Lydia. Essays one. 2020.
Chabon, Michael. The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union. 2008.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
SUSS
Jazz for Study
Jeff Oster - howling loon
★★★★★
The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>I’m using a monospace font that supports variable weights. In some applications you can specify the weight as a number between 1 - 1000, similar to CSS. For example, iAWriter supports this.
 Is there a way to set a custom weight in emacs? I’d like more fine grained control than light, regular, medium, etc.

 Screenshot of Emacs with three Eat terminals and a Eshell. Upper-left: line mode Upper-right: Sixel. Lower-left: Eat running Emacs, using truecolor support. Lower-right: Eat inside Eshell.
 Eat 0.9 has been released! 🎉
 Notable changes include:
  
Support for Emacs 26
 Sixel support
 Line mode (like Term mode&#x27;s one)
 Various bug fixes (including that cursor jumping bug).
  
Eat is a reasonably fast terminal emulator for Emacs written entirely in Emacs Lisp, with various features like shell intergration, 24bit colors, complete mouse support and Sixel support, etc. It can run most (if not all) full-screen terminal programs. It also allows to run full-screen programs in Eshell.

                              <span>I am writing a small major mode in Emacs, and I want to add some support for when electrc-*-modes are enabled.
 In particular, I need the following functionality:
  
Automatic newline when | is typed; and
 Indent and newline when [ is typed.
  
I have been looking into different ways of doing this, and I have come up with the following:
  
Using electric-layout-mode, e.g. (add-to-list &#x27;electric-layout-rules &#x27;(?| . before)); and
 Using electric-indent-mode, e.g. (setq-local electric-indent-chars (append electric-indent-chars &#x27;(?\[))).
  
I have also read about the electric-pairs-mode which might be more appropriate for the latter. There are also more manual ways of doing this, with hooks (post self insert hooks?).
 However, I am struggling to find any documentation on any electric functions, and different other major modes do these kind of things in different ways. My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after? If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better. But maybe it&#x27;s best that I keep these separate in case the user wants to enable, for example, layout mode but not pairs mode.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from developers of major modes with experience implementing such a feature!

                              <span>Typst is a very young but very promising markup language with use-cases similar to LaTeX. One big objective advantage of typst over LaTeX is compilation speed.
 For that reason alone, it would be nice to be able to export org to PDF through typst.
 Does anyone have a fledgling ox-typst implementation (open to contributions)?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently moved from straight.el to elpaca as my package manager. It works great and reduces the loading time a lot. But there&#x27;s one little annoyance that I&#x27;m not able to get rid off. That is, whenever I start emacs, it opens up with *elpaca-log* buffer. Is this the default behaviour? Or is it happening only with me because of my config? How can I fix this?

 In this post I will show how to significantly improve the performance of combinator based reducers by using a alternative abstraction algorithms. These algorithms are based on the paper λ to SKI, Semantically by Oleg Kiselyov and closely follow Ben Lynn’s implementation of Kiselyov’s ideas.
 I will also give detailed comparisons of the different approaches regarding emitted code size and execution performance on different reducers.

                              <span>TL;DR: New to Haskell and looking for an existing tool that can automatically insert traceShow statements for debugging. Also open to alternative suggestions or better ways to debug. Thanks in advance! 
 Hello, Haskell enthusiasts! 👋
 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and I&#x27;ve been exploring the language through a project I&#x27;m working on. To debug my code, I&#x27;ve been manually inserting &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements from the Debug.Trace module. While I find this method effective, it&#x27;s also quite time-consuming.
 Problem Statement:
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s an existing tool that can automate the insertion of &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements into Haskell code at key points. This would significantly streamline my debugging process.
 haskell
 -- Example: Original Code getMiddle2 :: String -&gt; String getMiddle2 sourceString | isOddLength &#x3D; takeMiddle 1 | otherwise &#x3D; takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength &#x3D; length sourceString ... 
 What I Would Like the Tool to Produce:
 haskell
 -- Example: With traceShow statements getMiddle2 :: String -&gt; String getMiddle2 sourceString | traceShow (&quot;Checking isOddLength:&quot;, isOddLength) isOddLength &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Taking middle 1:&quot;, takeMiddle 1) takeMiddle 1 | otherwise &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Taking middle 2:&quot;, takeMiddle 2) takeMiddle 2 where sourceLength &#x3D; traceShow (&quot;Source Length:&quot;, sourceLength) length sourceString ... 
 What I&#x27;ve Considered:
 I&#x27;ve thought about crafting a tool myself that involves parsing the Haskell source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traversing this tree to insert &#x60;traceShow&#x60; statements. But before going down that rabbit hole, I wanted to consult the community. Is there already a tool out there that can help me with this?
 Open to Suggestions:
 Being new to Haskell, I&#x27;m also open to any advice or alternative approaches for debugging or learning the language. If there&#x27;s a better way to do things, I&#x27;m all ears! 🐰
 Thank you for any recommendations, experiences, or advice you can share. I appreciate it! 🙏

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am delving into the development of a turn-based card game and exploring technology stack options. Considering the essential need for distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-availability systems in the game, I am leaning towards utilizing Scala and Akka. The revenue scope of the project stays within the bounds making Akka usage free. 
 Here are a few points I&#x27;m pondering upon:
  
How effective is Akka in managing distributed systems for a gaming application, especially concerning fault tolerance and high availability?
 
For a turn-based card game, does Scala (along with Akka) provide a viable and efficient development pathway, or should I be looking at different languages/libraries?
 
If you have experience using Scala/Akka in game development, are there any pitfalls or challenges that you encountered which might be insightful for a beginner in this stack?
 
 Any insights, alternative suggestions, or experiences shared will be incredibly valuable. Thank you!

                              <span>Hey Scala devs,
 Quick question: why no colons in extension methods? Object and class declarations use colons to group things neatly (methods, fields), but extension methods don&#x27;t. What&#x27;s the rationale behind this syntax difference? Is it just a stylistic choice or something more?

 &quot;com.lihaoyi&quot; %% &quot;upickle&quot; % &quot;3.0.0&quot;
 Added to library dependencies, but when I try to do
 import upickle.default._
 It is saying that upickle is not found. Are there any solutions to getting the dependencies to update?

                              <span>I am at a Russel Group University for computer science and physics and I haven’t done programming for around 2 years since school. I did good at computer science at school with an A aswell as an A at maths and B at physics. This being said however, I’m finding it really difficult to understand my computing classes. We are doing Functional programming with Haskell and the only thing I have programmed in was Visual Basic. Does anyone have any advice on getting good grades/better at Haskell programming

                              <span>I can fold functions/methods/classes but not code blocks (e.g. for, if, ...) or doc strings.
 How can I achieve the latter? Which component is responsible? Which doc I should read?
 I do use Emacs 27 and 29 with eglot and evil-mode.

                              <span>OK, first of all, I&#x27;ve tried the orgmode and I think it&#x27;s awesome. I like a lot of the advantages that emacs provides not being restricted to being a terminal app. However, despite it&#x27;s huge potential, I don&#x27;t know how people use it productively, I mean afaik it&#x27;s as potent as an OS so you can do crazy things like &quot;making a script to get code from anywhere&quot; so... Basically I want to ask you about the features that you like the most. I&#x27;m not a guy who is going to use just ONE editor tho, I have to use VSCode for several stuff, I use orgmode for... well documenting, organizing (I should use the code features that it provides, which blew my mind) and oc I use nvim. I want to know what are the things that people do that boosted their productivity in emacs vs other editors, I think each one has their strengths and weaknesses. Ty in advance.

                              <span>Is it possible to add vertical space at the top and bottom of the frame? I&#x27;ve found a mode for centering horizontally (thx, olivetti) but I&#x27;d really like something for vertical space as well. Preferably, buffer-local (specifically my org-mode buffers).
 Some searching showed me some really hacky things like creating two windows at the top and bottom, abusing faces, and other things.
 This seems like a trivial thing. Is this really not built in? I can play pong, run a terminal, manage X windows, browse the web, but I can&#x27;t add top and bottom margin without hacks?

                              <span>Projectile seems intent on sub-dividing my npm-based monorepo despite having placed this defun specifying that it should only consider a project root if it&#x27;s a vc-root-dir:
 ;; we need this wrapper to match Projectile&#x27;s API (defun projectile-vc-root-dir (dir) &quot;Retrieve the root directory of the project at DIR using &#x60;vc-root-dir&#x27;.&quot; (let ((default-directory dir)) (vc-root-dir))) (setq projectile-project-root-functions &#x27;(projectile-vc-root-dir)) 
 That was taken line-for-line from the Projectile docs. Despite this, and despite nuking all of my Projectile projects/caches (to be 100% sure), anytime I open a library directory within my monorepo; Projectile will consider that a new project and act accordingly (i.e. I can no longer search outside of that library&#x27;s directory). To put it more explicitly:
 / monorepo-root | |--libraryA |--libraryB 
 ... when I initially enter my project and search for a file, I can see that Projectile is correctly searching through all directories. However, when I then enter into, say, libraryA and again try to search for files in the monorepo, Projectile is only searching under libraryA (I understand it as being seen as a different project in Projectile&#x27;s eyes).
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>When doing some functions like (shell-command) or (project-compile) the minibuffer has control of the cursor meaning the text can be manipulated using the various text editing commands. 
 When in I-search though the cursor only flashes to the minibuffer and then returns to the buffer so whenever I do the text editing commands it edits the actual buffer and not the I-search target phrase.
 Is there a way to make I-search take control of the cursor in a similar way to the others? I tried swiper which takes control but it is very slow for me when search large files ~3000 lines.

                              <span>Hi,
 now that the Matrix bridge for libera.chat is closed, I&#x27;m trying to use irc the proper way with an irc client.
 I&#x27;ve a ZNC server running and it expects username and password in this format username:password , but ERC expects it in two seperate fields, one for each.
 This is what I currently have in my config:
 ;; C-c erc, keybinding will start erc (global-set-key &quot;\C-cerc&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (erc-ssl :server &quot;zncserver.org&quot; :port &quot;6697&quot; :nick &quot;nickiename&quot; :password &quot;password123&quot;))) 
 and this is the format ZNC server instruction page has:
 /server zncserver.org 6697 username:password 
 When I try the above ERC config, connection to the ZNC server fails.
 Then I tried using :nick &quot;nickiename:password123&quot; format in above ERC config, then connection was sucessful however ERC doesn&#x27;t recognize the second half as password and uses the whole as nick and ZNC server asks for the password again.
 How can I resolve this issue?

                              <span>I was recently looking through someone&#x27;s .emacs repo and saw they were using use-package chords for avy. I decided to give it a try. I can see the potential but it seems too slow. I&#x27;m forced to pause typing for a moment to allow it to register the chord before I can choose the char to go-to.
 I attached a gif below first showing what it looks like with a pause and then what happens when I type all the necessary commands in sequence. (in my case jw for avy-got-word and then o to go to words beginning with &#x27;o&#x27;)
 my setup is shown below
 (use-package avy
 :chords
 (&quot;jw&quot; . avy-goto-word-1))
 Is there anything i can do to make it more smooth and reliable?

 I recently hopped on the Emacs train and I came across an article where this screenshot was shared. I really liked the colors, fonts and the way it just looked. I was wondering if that was an available theme to download and if anyone could point me to it. I tried image searching, looking maybe the Doom Emacs themes, but could not find something that resembles it.

 Thanks for the help!

 This causes issues when working in org lists since the indentation breaks after the #+ lines. Is there a way to fix the rendering and indentation with org modern? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

 I wanted to share a new emacs package I&#x27;ve been working on, which is built on top of another project I created ~6 years ago. I let vzi bitrot for too long. I live inside emacs to the extent that I can, but one of the areas I&#x27;ve long been frustrated in is the ability to visualize data controlled from an emacs buffer. I&#x27;ve lately been enjoying deno, and got inspired and decided to finally rewrite vzi using it. Of course, I needed to be able to control it all from emacs with a few keystrokes, and hence vzi.el was born. If you are like me, you might appreciate these packages.
 The rough architecture of vzi is that it controls the browser remotely using the chrome devtools protocol, and pipes data to a host page from stdin. A final html report…</span>

Diff view supports diffing a branch against master which opens up a side panel with the changes, with 2 code buffers- one old, one new/local - while having LSP support on the current branch. https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/blob/main/USAGE.md. Any idea if it’s possible to do something in Emacs?
 I’m not looking to leave comments directly in Emacs (yet). I just want to be able to compare the diffs with some code intelligence. Thanks!

                              <span>A tip and questions about org-table formulas.
 I often use the bottom of a table to calculate some statistics (here in this example it is always just the sum of the column). To easily deduce, what was calculated, I like to add a simple string to the result (in this example it is always &quot;Sum:&quot;). 
 Now here is an example with the various methods I know to achieve this:
 | just append | it fails | utilize calc | plain elisp | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | | 3 | - | - | - | | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | | 8 | - | - | - | | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | |-------------+----------+--------------+-------------| | 55 Sum | m | Sum: 44 | Sum: 44 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$1&#x3D;vsum(@I$1..@III$1) Sum #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vsum(@I$2..@III$2);N Sum #+TBLFM: @&gt;$3&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;Sum: %s&quot; (calcFunc-vsum @I$3..@III$3));N #+TBLFM: @&gt;$4&#x3D;&#x27;(format &quot;Sum: %i&quot; (apply #&#x27;+ (mapcar #&#x27;string-to-number &#x27;(@I$4..@III$4)))) 
 As you can see, the first method fails in the second column, due to not all data are numbers.
 Now my question(s): How do you deal with calculating some column statistical data and what do you do to identify the results later? Have you maybe written a nice wrapper around those methods to make them easier to write/use them as table formulas?

 It doesn&#x27;t seem like chatgpt is tailored to emacs well enough. But in theory this should be possible to do right?

 I got tired of trying different calendar solutions in the desktop to manage appointments, when I take notes I want to refer to the dates of events, so it makes sense to keep it all in Emacs.
 There&#x27;s a lot of calendar/appointment options for org-mode, but I am not an org user, and was intrigued by the built in diary/calendar pair. After experimenting with them for a bit, and finding out there are built ins for:
 1. converting ics files to dairy-mode entries
 2. displaying notification for upcoming events
 3. communicating with DAV servers 
 I decided to try to build a package to sync events between diary files and a CalDAV server. I never quite figured out #3 but I was already so into the package that it didn&#x27;t matter :)
 There&#x27;s a plan to…</span>

                              <span>So this is how my indentation in emacs python mode looks like:

 And this is how it looks like when I &#x60;cat&#x60; from terminal, when I run the script it runs fine so it definitely has to do with the way emacs indents the file.

 I&#x27;ve already set &#x60;python-indent-guess-indent-offset&#x60; to nil and this is how my python indent settings look like:

 Indentation in emacs just looks wrong, is there anything I can do about?

 completing-read-multiple is an autoloaded byte-compiled Lisp function in ‘crm.el’. (completing-read-multiple PROMPT TABLE &amp;optional PREDICATE REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL-INPUT HIST DEF INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD) Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion. The arguments are the same as those of ‘completing-read’. Input multiple strings by separating each one with a string that matches the regexp ‘crm-separator’. For example, if the separator regexp is &quot;,&quot;, entering &quot;alice,bob,eve&quot; specifies the strings &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;, and &quot;eve&quot;. We refer to contiguous strings of non-separator-characters as &quot;elements&quot;. In this example there are three elements. Completion is a…</span>

                              <span>Org agenda is populated differently for today than for any other day. It fills the &quot;todo&quot; area with all the pending tasks. This is not done for any other day -- not for yesterday or for next month, when it shows only the agenda items that are active for that day or spanning that day. There are obvious performance reasons for this, and it is usually what I want -- except for when I am doing my daily journaling, when it would be massively useful to pull up the agenda AS IF I were on a previous day (usually &quot;yesterday&quot;). I only need this to be done once, for when I am journaling. How can I make a &quot;view as today&quot; command for my orgmode agenda?

 Does anyone know a fix for this.

                              <span>An active chat room helps a project grow and improve faster. The cabal project has been making great use of theirs (#hackage on Libera IRC), but it seemed to me that there was no equivalent for stack users and devs. I did some digging and discovered four stack-related chat rooms:
  
#stack-users and #stack-collaborators on the Haskell Foundation slack (the current maintainer is there)
 #haskell-stack on Libera IRC
 #haskell-stack:matrix.org on Matrix (created in 2018; was bridged to Libera for a while; the past and current maintainers are there)
  
All of these are currently low activity, but the Matrix room in particular has recently been spruced up and I&#x27;d like to invite you there to get and give help. Stack users, stack developers, stackage curators, haskell package maintainers, interested spectators - all are welcome. Hope to see you there!

Ian or &quot;zenhack&quot; may not have been the biggest name in the community, but I remember how obviously brilliant and eager to share with others he was. 
 Anyways, I guess I am just sharing because I hope that others can appreciate the work Ian has done and pick up the torch. Others who were closer have written kind words as well:

Also Haskell Cap&#x27;n Proto and Tempest/Sandstorm for those interested

                              <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Convenience in the Haskell ecosystem by bradrn
My motivation yesterday was wanting to do a spot of data analysis. Nothing complicated: essentially, I just needed to plot some fields from a JSON file.
Episode 34 – Lindsey Kuper by The Haskell Interlude
In this episode Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra chat with Lindsey Kuper, Assistant Professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. They discuss what to do when your data center gets hit by a tornado, life in academia versus life in industry, and what is choreographic programming.

Groundbreaking solutions can be discovered not only through innovation but also by uncovering hidden relationships within existing data. This is what Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) do.

Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult
to use.

Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user
interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium:
Simplicity: Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often
not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways,
leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers.
Memorability: How does one remember all those different options?
It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking
the usage text, man pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour.
Discoverability: Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know
(or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full

                              <span>I am totally newbie to Haskell.
 I&#x27;ve written a function &quot;custoEnergia&quot; which receives two parameters: &quot;salário&quot; and &quot;energia&quot;. It is defined just like this:.
 custoEnergia salario energia &#x3D; salario/ 5 * energia * 0.85
 The &quot;problem&quot; here is that the result is being truncated up to 2 decimals. I&#x27;d like it not to behave like this and show all numbers after the decimal.

                              <span>Hey folks, I created a toy clone of git using Haskell. I have been on and off learning Haskell for a while but never really did anything practical using it. Most resources (that I encountered) just teach you what monads are and that&#x27;s about it. I had the hang of monads for a while but never really had the confidence to make something practical using Haskell.
 Recently I decided to change that by doing some practical stuff using Haskell. So I present to you Hagit: A git clone written in Haskell. It is fairly limited but if you really try you can actually do version control using it (at least locally). It can also clone a repo.
 I have also extensively documented what I have done. As for how my experience was, I really enjoyed it, baring a few annoyances. The code is probably not idiomatic, as this is more or less my first attempt at making something practical with Haskell. If you have some time at your hand and want to dive into git internals please give it a read (the readme has links to 3 articles that have the details) and if possible please suggest what I could have done better.

                              <span>Packages are also used for distribution: the idea is that a package can be created in one place and be moved to a different computer and be usable in that different environment.
  
But that&#x27;s not true! I can&#x27;t give you a Haskell library package, not even in source form, and have it be usable in your environment!
 Cabal packages can only reference other packages in one of three cases:
  
If the package is available on Hackage.
 If both packages are part of the same directory structure.
 If the referencing package hardcodes the exact path to the referenced package.
  
None of those is suitable for third-party distribution of packages outside of Hackage!
 How is a package usable on another computer if it hard-codes the exact location of every dependency it has?
 C has an include path. Java has an include path. Why does Haskell require a .cabal file to hard code the path to all of its dependencies?!

Passing arguments as header args, and 2.) Treating org files as executables without a harness (or maybe a very lightweight one).
 Thanks!

                              <span>Looking for a comfortable way to use emacs for ssh-ing to the servers of our company, but still having issues. Non solution is ideal. I have to use a proxy command to login as a user and after logged in can use sudo to get root.
 My preferred solution in emacs would be eshells cd /ssh: way. With this I also have the default directory synchronized and can easily use C-x C-f to edit files. Tab completion works too, as long I do not sudo -i .
 If I do - completions will break, which is not ideal because I have several scripts in the root path which I need to complete.
 If I leave the eshell way and use mx-shell oder eat-shell etc. I will have tab completion everywhere but the directory is not synched.
 I know I can just type C-x C-f /ssh:user@host|sudo::/file
 But the hostnames we are using are quite long and generic. So this would be a bit of a hazzle.
 Does anyone has a hint for me how I could come around this?
 My last idea would be a small function which gets the hostname from the eat buffer and triggers find-files with the correct path. But maybe there is something better and yes - I would prefer eshell for the whole thing.

The two laptops have different default font sizes in my init, and when they&#x27;re plugged into the monitor, I need to manually adjust each frame for the font to be readable. Is there any way to make Emacs automatically adjust the font-size so that it increases until it can fit fill-column within the frame?

 This is mostly to put a stable tag on a bunch of changes that have been in master for a while (and to justify some riskier changes next). But hopefully some will find this list useful anyway.

                              <span>In my config, I have set:
 (require &#x27;smtpmail) (setq send-mail-function &#x27;smtpmail-send-it smtpmail-smtp-server &quot;smtp.gmail.com&quot; smtpmail-stream-type &#x27;ssl smtpmail-smtp-service 465) 
 But the port is always 25. If I manually run this code from the scratch buffer, it changes fine, and I can send mail correctly. Happens when using both mail and compose-mail.
 Anyone knows what might cause this?

                              <span>Since installing Firefox on Debian via flatpak, so that I can keep up with the latest version instead of the apt realease, Emacs is erroring whenever I try to open org links for example, with &#x27;Searching for program: No such file or directory, firefox&#x27;.
 Thanks to a helpful answer on StackExchange I&#x27;ve got both my shell and eshell aliases set up so that I can simply run firefox at the prompt, as an alias for flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox
 I guess the answer to my question probably likes somewhere in modifying the variables browse-url-firefox-program , or browse-url-generic-programme ?

                              <span>I am writing a simple major mode for syntax highlighting for a query language. I have been supporting versions 23 and greater, however I have found myself wanting to use rx-define, which was introduced in version 27.
 How much support for older versions of Emacs should I provide? Is it unreasonable to require version 27 or newer of Emacs for this simple mode?

                              <span>Hej fellows,
 through work, I have discovered TimeTimers some years ago. I have found it easy to work with, which is why I&#x27;ve bought one for myself. However, I&#x27;ve been meaning to have something like this in emacs, because I&#x27;ve noticed that no matter the package (be it built-in or tmr), I am missing the convenience that a TimeTimer provides.
 First off, I&#x27;d like to know if any of you know a package that does this or something like this: conveniently display (in the modeline, maybe?) a bar or clock that shows the passage of time in a continuous fashion, i.e. showing a graphic representation (like a bar going from full to empty or a pie chart going from full to empty) instead of changing numbers (the customary form of representing a timer in my experience).
 If that&#x27;s not a thing -- and I&#x27;d be flabbergasted about that to be frank --, I&#x27;d love to get some tips on how to implement this. If I were to choose, I&#x27;d preferably have a timetimer implemented as a decreasing progress bar in the mode line. The width would be depending upon the &quot;available space&quot; (dunno if there is a way to find that out for different configurations of modelines), the progress bar would be recalculated in regular intervals and the (pseudo-)continuous steps would be calculated depending on the time input when setting the timer. Maybe, the progress bar could &quot;blink&quot; (i.e. disappear and reappear) an amount of times to be set by a variable. For graphical representation, I am eyeing the SVG-LIB by Nicolas Rougier.
 I am grateful for tips and pointers, I am a bit at a loss as to where to start.
 Have a good day!

                              <span>Often times I find doing various commands in org-mode adds/removes whitespace around headings. This can lead to inconsistent whitespace throughout the file. Kind of annoying.
 Are there any tools to manage this? Like an auto formatter or something?

                              <span>Hi everyone! Last week I released version 0.4 of ekg, which is an extensible tag-based, sqlite-backed note taking application for emacs.
 This version has been in the works for months, and has notable improvements:
 Drafts! You can now save (with C-x C-s) long notes and they will be tagged with &quot;draft&quot; and not show in other places until you commit the note.
 Magic tags! You can now have tags that automatically execute some elisp, useful for special notes that need some different editing. The standard example is setting your input method for notes with a tag indicating it&#x27;s in a different language.
 LLM integration! Now you can have LLMs response to your notes inline, with prompts configured based on your tags. We use the new GNU ELPA llm package, so we support whatever it supports (right now Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex&#x27;s APIs)
 File notes! Just like you can have notes on URLS, can you now have notes on files! It&#x27;s basically a way to annotate any file. And because of how our prompt, template, and prefixing rules work, the directory structure can control the templates and prompts for any LLM integration you have.
 Also, here&#x27;s a video demonstrating these features!
 Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, notably Jay Rajput, Umar Ahmad and Qingshui Zheng!

Is anyone else experiencing Marked 2&#x27;s Streaming preview feature crashing with use of the Archive? I&#x27;ve recently updated to the new OS and this is the only change I can think of that could be the cause of the error. Marked 2 still works if I go to zettle and open manually.
Anyone else having this issue?</span>

 Haskell Camp will be a time-bound, online event where people who wish to learn Haskell (&quot;Learners&quot;) get connected with people who wish to help people learn Haskell (&quot;Helpers&quot;).
  
You can sign up either as a Helper or a Learner.
 Learners will be grouped and paired with a Helper.
 Each Helper will have a guided exercise meant to get a beginner&#x27;s feet wet in Haskell. 
 Think of it like a &quot;craft&quot; you&#x27;d do at camp as a kid. They have guided structure around the technical parts, but still allow for the pers…</span>

                              <span>So the problem is to find the length of the longest run of spaces in a string. Just out of curiousity, I wanted to know if there is a way to use optics to solve it. Now, I know that I could write a function like this: runs :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]] that finds all the runs of elements, based on a predicate and make a traversal out of it, but if I already had a function like this, there would be no point in doing that. So, my question is: is there a way to use just optics to succinctly solve this problem?

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/16yx9p6/can_natural_transformations_be_restricted_in/">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Let the following be functors
 newtype F x &#x3D; F x instance Functor F where fmap f (F x) &#x3D; F $ f x newtype G x &#x3D; G x instance Functor G where fmap f (G x) &#x3D; G $ f x 
 Then the following is a Natural transformation
 eta :: F a -&gt; G a eta (F a) &#x3D; G a 
 Which can be seen (though not proved, as it would require singletons) by providing the definition for the legs of the natural transformation.
 etaLeg1 :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F a -&gt; G b etaLeg1 f &#x3D; eta . fmap f etaLeg2 :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F a -&gt; G b etaLeg2 f &#x3D; fmap f . eta 
 Now, let the following be functors (The following does not type check. Or I don&#x27;t know how to make it type check.)
 newtype Monoid x &#x3D;&gt; F&#x27; x &#x3D; F&#x27; x instance Functor F&#x27; where fmap f (F&#x27; x) &#x3D; F&#x27; $ f x newtype Monoid x &#x3D;&gt; G&#x27; x &#x3D; G&#x27; x instance Functor G&#x27; where fmap f (G&#x27; x) &#x3D; G&#x27; $ f x 
 In both instances, f is a monoid homomorphism. The above can be seen to make sense by defining the following, which are basically restricted fmap&#x27;s:
 fmapF&#x27; :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; F&#x27; b fmapF&#x27; f (F&#x27; x) &#x3D; F&#x27; $ f x fmapG&#x27; :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; G&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b fmapG&#x27; f (G&#x27; x) &#x3D; G&#x27; $ f x 
 Would, then, the following be a &quot;Restricted&quot; Natural Transformation?
 phi :: Monoid a &#x3D;&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; a phi (F&#x27; a) &#x3D; G&#x27; a phiLeg1 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b phiLeg1 f &#x3D; phi . fmapF&#x27; f phiLeg2 :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; F&#x27; a -&gt; G&#x27; b phiLeg2 f &#x3D; fmapG&#x27; f . phi 
 It seems to be obvious that phi is a natural transformation, but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that something could be wrong.

                              <span>A variation of this question have been asked before, unfortunately, I am not bright enough to understand them. So I am asking this question to hopefully get a more concrete answer from a particularly generous haskeller.
 When I researched the type of IO in haskell, I get this from ghci info:
 (GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld -&gt; (# GHC.Prim.State# GHC.Prim.RealWorld, a #))
 I am not quite sure what any of this means, but from what I gather, this abstracts to something like this: IO _ :&#x3D; (RealWorld -&gt; (RealWorld, _ )). This looks like the state monad, which has type: [W, W × _ ], for a choice of state handling type W. The StateT monad I see in documentation is a little different since it has monad composition StateT (s -&gt; m (a, s)), so I guess I should say that we require the monad m to be the idenitity monad. 
 My question is, why do we need to use these primitive types? Somehow, this makes it possible for IO functions to interact with the outside environment, like call other programs or writing to the file system. But how does that happen exactly? 
 Second, what is this RealWorld? Is it a bitestring? An integer? A constant? When updating the state, what actually happens? 
 Lastly, the ST monad, which has definition: ST s a. This type allows us to perform mutations to inside variables but it does not allow effects. From what I gather, this does in fact mutate memory. It also has a function to &quot;escape&quot; the ST wrapper, called runST. Obviously, this makes practical sense, but what is stopping up from simply writing a function runIO that escapes the IO. That would most certainly be a bug, but what is preventing us from doing it?

 I heard the Haskell online community was supportive so I decided to look for some help.
 For context: I have never touched Haskell or Prolong
 I just started a Haskell class last week and this is insanely difficult (for me). I don&#x27;t understand the Syntax of this language. Worst part is my exam is all code and i have 9 weeks to prepare :(
 Any good resources?

                              <span>Hey,
 As the VSCode Haskel extention now requires HLS 2.3.0.0, I updated it together with cabal and stack (both upgraded to the recommended version). Ever since though, the extention is not working. 
 I’ve nuked ghcup and reinstalled the extension to try to solve the issue, but it did not work.
 Extension output log: https://pastebin.com/RLqrUfHV
 Any suggestions on what to do?

It seems like it &quot;solves&quot; many issues or annoying things from Haskell. I wanted to know the opinion of Idris in comparison with Haskell. Is there something Haskell can do better from a type-system perspective? If Idris had the same community size as Haskell and the same maturity, would you choose Idris instead?

 VSCode doesn&#x27;t recognize implicit returns so you have to unindent manually when you move to the beginning of the next line if youre starting a new function and indent manually when you start a function. Scalafmt doesn&#x27;t recognize bad indentation either.
 Intellij Idea object MyProgram: def abs(n: Int): Int &#x3D; if n &lt; 0 then -n else n private def formatAbs(x: Int) &#x3D; &lt;-- val msg &#x3D; &quot;The absolute value of %d is %d&quot; &lt;-- Metals doesn&#x27;t indent msg.format(x, abs(x)) &lt;--Metals doesn&#x27;t indent @ main def hello: Unit &#x3D; println(formatAbs(-42)) 
 I tried Idea and their support is even worse it wouldn&#x27;t even let me unindent the private which defaulted to the indentation level of the &#x60;else&#x60; statement in the abs function. 
 How can I get VSCode to behave correctly? I don&#x27;t really want to manually adjust indentation on every line every time that just seems tedious.
 Edit: from my research I can just use curly braces after the &#x3D; in definitions and this will enforce the indentation rules. https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/other-new-features/indentation.html
 Is this safe/reasonable to do? I imagine it’s not idiomatic, but having to do this manually will drive me nuts. 
 I want to learn FP but this is really I convenient if this isn’t viable I’ll probably just opt to learn Ocaml instead.

 tree-sitter doesn&#x27;t recognize FOOPTY_API since it&#x27;s a dllexport, and I think it&#x27;s probably a windows-only construct. How would I go about making sure it parses that part properly?
 Also, the GENERATED_BODY() specifier is an Unreal-ism, and I don&#x27;t think it causes any trouble, but it would be nice if I could add it (and other Unreal specific identifiers) to a list for specific highlighting and/or indentation instructions. 
 Where&#x27;s a good place to start with these sort of small-scale tweaks? I&#x27;ve seen some links to posts with titles like, &quot;Let&#x27;s write a major mode&quot; but I&#x27;m really just trying to tweak the existing C++ mode to handle a couple weirdo special cases. (Though I think maybe the dllexport thing MIGHT be big enough that it should be included, so maybe I should file a bug?)

                              <span>Lots of people use python interactively through M-x run-python and send code to it with things like C-c C-c and C-c C-r. That&#x27;s fair enough, but it has it&#x27;s problems. When an imported library changes the only sensible way to deal with it is to stop the python process and start another one. (That&#x27;s because in Python the built in &quot;import&quot; statement doesn&#x27;t reload the file. You could reload each library with reload, but that would be tricky.)
 For that reason, I would like to use M-x compile. It&#x27;s suitable for that kind of thing and I&#x27;ve used it for running programs written in other languages. (I think this is a fairly well known Emacs trick).
 The problem is Venvs. My projects use venv. If I just start a fresh python using M-x compile then it won&#x27;t be in the right venv. I&#x27;ve thought about writing a batch file to solve this problem. I expect though, someone has already written a package to solve this?
 Is there such a package?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying for the past three days to get elfeed to display desktop notifications. It was suggested that elfeed-new-entry-hook can be used and it works, but parsing it is a painful trial and error.
 I&#x27;ve added https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed?unit&#x3D;second&amp;interval&#x3D;10 feed to be able to test it.
 This works for example:
 (add-hook &#x27;elfeed-new-entry-hook (lambda (entry) (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) &quot; -_ &quot; (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity &#x27;high ))) 
 But changing elfeed-entry-title (on the 5th line) to elfeed-entry-tags or &#x60;elfeed-entry-feed makes it fail (no notifications appear anymore).
 Does anyone have any idea why?
 UPDATE: Solved it (defun created for debugging):
 (defun elfeed-desktop-notifications (entry) &quot;Parse and display new feeds as desktop notifications.&quot; (alert (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)) :title (concat (elfeed-feed-title (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-feed entry))) &quot;\n&quot; (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-title entry)) ) :severity &#x27;high )) (add-hook &#x27;elfeed-new-entry-hook #&#x27;elfeed-desktop-notifications)

                              <span>Hello guys,I sometimes use the windows version of emacs at work, and one neat feature of windows is Super (windows key) + V, which is like the traditional copy/paste except that it lets you browse your clipboard history before pasting.
 The menu does pop up but selecting an entry does nothing.
 I use it quite often for other programs, but emacs ignores it (vanilla emacs 29.1, launched without init.el (-Q option).
 Have you succeeded in making it work ? In general, I am curious as to how the sync between clipboard and kill-ring is done.

                              <span>Hello all. I&#x27;ve recently made another video about my 3D game engine project Game :: Dangerous (written in Haskell), which can be found as follows.
 Project repos: https://github.com/Mushy-pea
 Video: https://youtu.be/wOSQ1cYoZXM?si&#x3D;bF2UtM_zr8OYOPHi
 I&#x27;m interested in what people think about some of the design choices I&#x27;ve made. One of the most interesting things to me about software development is how design and implementation interact. So briefly, the engine is not a development framework such as Unity or Unreal (nor anywhere near that complex) but more similar to GZDoom for example. It&#x27;s a program that loads a text file, within which is encoded environment geometry, game logic scripting and references to asset files. The game logic scripting is implemented through a virtual machine in the engine that runs a bytecode form of the engine&#x27;s custom scripting language.
 I spent a long time deciding how to implement a map editor, when I probably should have decided early on and developed it in parallel. What I eventually decided to do (in June 2022) was to write a local web server that loaded the same map files as the engine, allowed their state to be queried and modified through API requests from a client and could save that state back to the same text file format. That server now makes up about 20% of the Haskell code in the main repo and shares some static libraries with the engine. I&#x27;ve also started writing the web client that provides a UI for the map editor, a prototype of which is shown in the video.
 Anyway, thanks for reading and looking forward to feedback if anyone feels like it.

                              <span>I want to make my code look consistent and neat. I don’t have any personal stylistic preferences at the moment – I want to pick a widely accepted style and stick with it. I’m used to tools like Rust’s rustfmt, which have a well-defined style with good defaults.
 What formatters does Haskell have that are similar to them? ormolu and fourmolu look like good options with sensible defaults.

 However I was curious if you guys have some more experience with libraries that are more suited for game development? Not necessarily engines (tho with would be nice if Haskell has them), but something that can handle more complex cases.

                              <span>This is a general question, though it comes up because I&#x27;ve started using Emacs 29 and tree-sitter.
 There are 4 presets listed for tree-sitter, with a few more for the standard C(++) modes:
  
Gnu
 BSD
 Linux
 K&amp;R
  
Where in any of the emacs documentation are these indentation styles explained? I eventually found them on wikipedia, but that&#x27;s frankly a terrible cop-out on the documentation side. The manual helpfully gives shrug-emoji style descriptions like this, for the BSD style: &quot;Also known as “Allman style” after Eric Allman.&quot; 
 Moreover, I&#x27;d like to know what exactly emacs (or tree-sitter) thinks these styles mean. Just because there&#x27;s a definition on wikipedia doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what&#x27;s being adhered to.
 But even better is if I could just use the clang-format style in real time, rather than waiting for it to clean up after me. Is there anything that already does that?

 Looking for a few brave souls to give it a try. Love to find bugs and functional improvements that my dogfooding hasn&#x27;t uncovered.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have lsp mode breadcrumbs enabled and I have treemacs lsp installed as well. The icons used in the breadcrumbs and treemacs were really blurry so I installed treemacs nerd icons and now treemacs has icons that are much cleaner but lsp breadcrumbs still has the blurry icons. 
 Anyone know how to get a crisper icon in lsp mode breadcrumbs?

                              <span>Does anyone else have the same problem?
 If I run sage-shell:run-sage to get a SageMath shell in Emacs, and run help(), I get the standard help message, which starts with &quot;Welcome to Sage 10.1!&quot;.
 But if I try help(diff) or any other specific function, Emacs hangs. Doing C-g allows me to use Emacs again, but the SageMath session is no longer responsive: trying to enter any other command results in hanging. Even C-c C-d no longer works, I have to try C-c C-\ and wait for the SageMath kernel to crash, or do M-x kill-process.
 This all seemed to work before I upgraded Emacs and changed my package manager to straight.el.
 I&#x27;m on Emacs 29.1, using sage-shell-mode v0.3.
 I&#x27;ve covnfigured it as follows:
 (use-package sage-shell-mode :straight t :defer t :custom (sage-shell:sage-executable (executable-find &quot;sage&quot;)) (sage-shell:set-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:check-ipython-version-on-startup nil) (sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit nil) (sage-shell:use-simple-prompt nil) ) 
 (However, I find that the custom settings aren&#x27;t being respected either ...)
 I also use ob-sagemath, which allows me to use SageMath in org-src-blocks, which works fine as far as I can tell.

                              <span>I am using EWW to read articles and I want to capture notes into an exisiting file not part of capture templates. The overall workflow is as follows. Lets say I want to catch up on the GPT agents of generative AI and prompt engineering. I google the topic in EWW and just read with a org file open on the side buffer. I want to take notes and capture quotes into a that org file. when I select text from EWW, and intiate capture I want to insert text into the org file on the side where the point (cursor) is or even at the end of the file. How can I configure org-capture for this?
 EDIT:
 Think of it like this. I want to have a org file each reading session and I have have multiple reading sessions in parallel (session don&#x27;t mean single chunk of time). How can i configure org-capture so that I can create a new org file for each reading session. or org-capture is not the right tool for this? Some other workflow?

                              <span>Hello Emacs users, I&#x27;m currently trying to re-do my own emacs configuration but after facing thousands of issues, indenting buffers is the one thing that&#x27;s going to turn me bald in a matter of hours.
 I&#x27;m trying to work with multiple languages, Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, etc. The one thing I haven&#x27;t figured out correctly is proper indentation without having to do keyboard gymnastics. I know that Emacs is more of a DIY thing, so any light shed here would be of great help. 
 I&#x27;ve already tried (add-hook …), using the :config section in my (use-package go-mode) declarations and more but none of them are having any visible effect. 
 Furthermore, I saw this issue with Go and I heavily suspect other programming languages won&#x27;t come out as clean as I think. 
 Every time I edit a Go file, when adding a new line to anything that needs indentation (e.g: a function body, if, for, etc.) Two “4 spaces” tabs are inserted no matter what. Even when I press the  key I have to backspace ALWAYS, also some closing delimiters like }) don&#x27;t align properly, but I suspect that&#x27;s another issue maybe fixed by puni.
 ​
 The “best” thing I could do to prevent newlines from getting messed up on creation was turning off electric-indent, I&#x27;ve heard mixed opinions on that, some say it&#x27;s great, some say it&#x27;s terrible, I don&#x27;t really know. Without electric-indent I don&#x27;t have to backspace two tabs on a newline, but TAB still creates those two tabs, even when my modeline reports (TABx4). Here is a snippet of the important stuff in my configuration file. 
 (setq-default c-basic-offset 4 tab-width 4 indent-tabs-mode t standard-indent 4) ;; jsjsjsjs (electric-pair-mode 1) ;; Disable electric-indent messing up my code &gt;:( (setq electric-indent-inhibit t electric-indent-mode nil) 
 If any of you could spare your elisp-fu powers to me, I would be extremely thankful. Thanks for your time in advance. :)

                              <span>Hi!
 I just stumbled upon a difference between the Scala 2 and Scala 3 compilers that originated in at least one bug in the form of NullPointerExceptions, that we didn&#x27;t have to worry about before.
 It&#x27;s super simple to reproduce, given a REPL:Scala 3.3.1
 scala&gt; val test: String &#x3D; test val test: String &#x3D; null 
 Scala 2.13.11
 scala&gt; val test: String &#x3D; test ^ warning: value test does nothing other than call itself recursively val test: String &#x3D; null 
 That warning is the difference between knowing that you are doing something weird or not. Although I&#x27;m not sure why this is even a warning and not an error, when would you ever want to initialize a variable by assigning to itself?Is this something that should be fixed in the Scala 3 compiler? 
 EDIT: this is already a known issue https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14429

                              <span>Dotty-cps-async 0.9.19 ( https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async ) is on Maven Central.
 New in this release:
  
Optional loom support for JDK-21. With the help of Loom, we can transform arguments of high-order functions without requiring a shifted variant of this function to be available.
  
​
 def topScored[A](c:Iterable[A], n: Int)(score: A&#x3D;&gt;Double) &#x3D; c.map(a&#x3D;&gt;(a,score(a)).sortBy(- _._2).take(n) ... val top100 &#x3D; topScore(c,100)(a &#x3D;&gt; await(fetchScore(a.id)) 
 Note that this also works for effect monads.
  
Direct context encoding: it&#x27;s still under experimental annotation but much closer to full functionality. Now we can call a direct-encoded function over G[_] in the context of F[_] if the inclusion of G in F. This can be a foundation for the natural encoding of monadic effect stacks:
 type IOResource &#x3D; [X]&#x3D;&gt;&gt;Resource[IO,X]
 def open(name: Path, options: OpenOption*)(using CpsDirect[IOResource]): AsynchronousFileChannel &#x3D;
 .....
 def read(input: AsynchronousFileChannel, bufSize: Int)(using CpsDirect[IO]): ByteBuffer &#x3D;
 ....
 //Then later inside asyncScope[IO]:
 val channel &#x3D; open(name, READ)
 val data &#x3D; read(input, BUF_SIZE) 
 ....
 
A few bug fixes.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I just published a new scala blog, especially for total beginners to the language. I explained about the usage of Scala-CLI, Scala Toolkit and Scastie to make the Scala learning easier for beginners. 
 With this, I am hoping that some of you who are starting out with the Scala journey might find it useful.

                              <span>As far as I understand function with class constraints are transformed into a function with an extra parameter being the typeclass dictionary. This allows the function to not have to be specialized and only decide at runtime what to do exactly (sorry for the bad explanation). In short Show a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; String is transform internally to Dict a -&gt; a -&gt; String.
 I have a discussion on discourse where people consider this extra parameter as part of the function: Show a -&gt; a -&gt; String has TWO parameters.
 My intuition is that this extra parameter is only the result of an implementtaion choice. An hypotetical compiler could work back from the main an instantiate all functions with required types. Therefore passing a class dictionaly might be needed for practical reason but not in theory.
 Am I right or is dictionary passin the only way to implement typeclass in Haskell ?

                              <span>Hi, Gnu Emacs noob here. I&#x27;m having trouble debugging AUCTeX. When I run TeX-command-run-all with C-c C-a Biber is not run for some reason I can&#x27;t figure out, and I must run it manually with C-c C-c Biber RET to have my citations properly compiled. 
 Does anyone know how I can forse C-c C-a to run Biber as well as the other commands? 
 My config is pretty vanilla and for AUCTeX is as follows: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; Auctex (require &#x27;package) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;auctex) (package-install &#x27;auctex))
 (require &#x27;tex)
 (push (list &#x27;output-pdf &quot;Skim&quot;) TeX-view-program-selection) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 29.1 downloaded from MacPorts on a MacBook Air m1.
 thanks!

 I tried the junos-mode but it behaved rather weirdly.
 Is there a programming language mode that will be suitable for this format?
 If not, is there a mode which can do the following, or something close to these?
  
Backspace at whitespace indents properly with previous block
 Ability to collapse and expand blocks depending on indent level or matching brace
 spell check using words already used in the buffer
  
Will appreciate your help!

 These 3 dots; I want to be able to click them to open/close the code. I searched quite a bit and found nothing about having them open/close with mouse. If they can be opened/closed with keyboard as well even better, but mainly I want to with mouse.
 The language I use is python.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I was wandering what do you guys use to program -let’s say a package- and test it as you go? So far I’ve been coding in the scratch buffer and executing blocks, but that seems really inefficient, I’m sure there is another way, more so in the case of writing long packages. 
 I’m used to coding in Python in emacs using the repl which includes a python interactive console, but I cannot find the equivalent for emacs lisp.
 I would be grateful if you could point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance for your help.

                              <span>I am editing an i3 file and it opens up with conf-mode. Indent-region remove all indentations from the region. The syntax is the following:
 conf { content } 
 I am aware that I need to setup indent-line-function to make this work, but I don&#x27;t know enough Elisp to write a function to parse the file and make the proper indentation. A hack I thought of is use to use another&#x27;s mode indent function like nginx&#x27;s nginx-indent-line. I could also copy the function and use it by itself, not requiring to load the mode, but I don&#x27;t know if this is the most appropriate way to handle this problem.
 EDIT: I already use Alexander-Miller/i3wm-Config-Mode which only improves the syntax highlighting.

Unfortunately, my development experience has been okay-ish with Emacs. I have installed lsp along with corfu for completions (and web-mode for ReactJS) but the completions are not as good as VSCode. They are quite slow too. Here&#x27;s the link to my config file. How can I improve the completions? I would also like it to highlight unused imports (flycheck isn&#x27;t doing it, idk why). Just this much would suffice :) I don&#x27;t need anything else from a code-editor (although Emacs is so much more than that).

 I&#x27;m new to emacs and so far it&#x27;s really easy to use and it&#x27;s very effective. One annoying thing however is that every time I edit the code I&#x27;m writing, I have to quit() in the interpreter, close the window (Ctrl-x + 0), restart the interpreter (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) and reimport the code.
 I edit the code and then just write &quot;import *script*&quot; but the changes don&#x27;t appear unless I do it as mentioned above.
 Even if I just quit(), I can&#x27;t just (Ctrl-c + Ctrl-p) again because I have to close the buffer for it to start again.
 Is it supposed to be like this? Or am I doing something wrong?
 Thanks in advance!

 (short to-the-point question under)
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs, ubuntu and all those stuff; I&#x27;m studying computer science, I&#x27;m a first year and we&#x27;re using Linux and (I&#x27;m using) emacs. On the school computers we have to input given commands in the Linux console to get access to the &quot;import cv2&quot;, but I do most of my work home and I have a windows.
 I was then wondering how I can download (?) and make it so I can import &quot;cv2&quot; and use it&#x27;s commands like &quot;cv2.imread(&#x27;plane.jpg&#x27;)&quot; and so on. I&#x27;ve searched on google but found nothing useful.
 I&#x27;m kind of just starting out so I don&#x27;t understand what it means to &quot;mix&quot;/&quot;import&quot; OpenCV into emacs and such things. I have downloaded OpenCV (I think) but I couldn&#x27;t just start emacs and start using the functions from &quot;import cv2&quot;.
 ​
 Short question: How can I use the &quot;import cv2&quot; on emacs and start working with pictures? As beginner friendly as possible.
 Thank you in advance!

 I mainly work on real time kernels for embedded systems, boot loaders, etc. written in C. I also frequently write in Make, Bash, Rust, Python, and Go.

I imagine such feature would be very useful for multiple if-else, case(s), and other nested code with lots of leafs

 Release notes:
  
Further to the release notes for Stack 2.3.1, the -static suffix has been removed from the statically linked Linux/x86_64 binaries.
 The binaries for Linux/Aarch64 are now statically linked.
 Binaries are now provided for macOS/AArch64.
  
Changes since v2.11.1:
 Behavior changes:
  
Build artefacts are placed in .stack-work/dist/
/ (hashed to a shorter path on Windows), rather than.stack-work/dist/
/. This allows build artifacts to be distinguished by GHC version.
 By default, the stack build progress bar is capped to a length equal to the terminal width.
 When building GHC from source, Stack no longer uses Hadrian&#x27;s deprecated -…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to org-mode but think it&#x27;s the best tool for task and project management I&#x27;ve ever used.
 But there are reasons why I would like to stick to markdown for my general note-taking.
 So I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to: 1. Make org-mode recognise.md files (I know this is YES). 2. Make org-mode pick-up TODO states from org-mode headings appearing in .md files with otherwise md syntax (*** TODO Read this, somewhere in md file) and show it in agenda. 3. Or even make org-mode recognise some md elements (headings or Obsidian-style checkboxes) with TODO states.
 I know 1 is possible, though not sure who uses this for what. I think 2 might be possible? And would probably be exactly what I need. Option 3 smells like somethink no-one should ever attempt, yet I&#x27;m not sure why (not).
 Thanks!!

                              <span>I have a trait and several case classes that extend the trait.
 each case class shares the definition for &quot;update&quot; methods that use the copy function that they get from being case classes. Since the methods are all the same I want to declare them once in the trait definition but can&#x27;t because it would require using copy() which is automatically generated for case classes. 
 I&#x27;m new to Scala but this seems like an issue that would come up often unless I am not writing in the best Scala style or it&#x27;s not that big of an inconvenience.
 are case classes syntactic sugar for normal classes that inherit or extend a special class or trait that I exploit?

                              <span>I would appreciate your thoughts on how to improve the data type modelling for my app. This gonna be a relatively long post. If you don’t find it appropriate to be posted here, please let me know.
 My goal is to follow u/lexi-lambda’s principle of &quot;Parse, don’t validate&quot; as close as possible, but I have the feeling of failing big in this regard.
 I am currently working on a GTK4 app that loads a yaml file and creates form widgets for the entries in this file. It might look like this
 inputForms: - &#x27;#key&#x27;: text &#x27;#type&#x27;: textarea &#x27;#title&#x27;: Text &#x27;#multiple&#x27;: -1 # we can have infinitely many of them. &#x27;#value&#x27;: - &#x27;Some input text.&#x27; # we saved two - &#x27;Some more&#x27; # and will create to widgets when loading - &#x27;#key&#x27;: person &#x27;#type&#x27;: name &#x27;#title&#x27;: Person &#x27;#multiple&#x27;: 6 # we can have 6 of them. - &#x27;#ke…</span>

 Also I&#x27;ve noticed that emacs users... kind of don&#x27;t use notifications (org-agenda, elfeed)? Do you all guys just have photographic memory, see the future, read minds to not need to keep up with any schedule?

                              <span>I started using emacs this week and have been interested in using org. I went for a modular config and attached my very simple org module below.
 From what I&#x27;ve read so far there isn&#x27;t necessarily a &quot;correct&quot; way to configure emacs but I&#x27;m asking for a critique on anything in this module. Whether that be my use of use-package (especially as I&#x27;ve found its documentation somewhat unclear), my custom function, code style, or anything. I would appreciate any two cents or bits of wisdom as I begin my journey configuring emacs.

                              <span>There is a really niche, but simple package for elfeed that adds system notifications: https://github.com/flocks/elfeed-notifier/blob/master/elfeed-notifier.el
 However loading it by default with straight package manager doesn&#x27;t work:
 (package! elfeed-notifier :recipe (:host github :repo &quot;flocks/elfeed-notifier&quot;)) 
 Nothing happens, no function or variables are available.
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s the standard procedure for loading such packages? I assume that it has something to do with use-package?

                              <span>through little bit of research i have found a way to make Emacs faster with lsp and eglot none of this are my code i just found it from browsing on reddit
 (fset #&#x27;jsonrpc--log-event #&#x27;ignore) remove laggy typing it probably reduces chatty json from lsp to eglot i guess
 (setq eglot-events-buffer-size 0) disabling event logging in eglot
 (setq eglot-sync-connect nil) disabling elgot freeze the UI for up to 3s when you open file maybe large one
 install gcmh package to increase the gc value when necessary and decrease it. nice package btw
 (add-hook &#x27;focus-out-hook &#x27;garbage-collect) optional, if you don&#x27;t want to use gcmh package
 (setq eglot-connect-timeout nil) optional &quot;my code actually&quot;
 set this values on company package or
 (setq company-idle-delay 0) how long to wait for company mode to wait after it got completion obviously you don&#x27;t want to wait so just set it to 0
 (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1) how many characters you want to type before popping up the completion UI obviously 1 right
 if there is anything that i am missing pls let me know guys, am new to Emacs i want to learn from you all. i would love to see your config too to learn how to configure mine too

                              <span>I&#x27;m running emacs off the master branch, compiling with the following flags:
 ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-modules --with-cairo --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;no
 When I open a PDF and enable pdf-tools with pdf-tools-install the performance is initially great. However, after I resize with +,- the performance dramatically drops, scrolling becomes extremely laggy to the point of being unusable. Resetting the buffer restores the performance. Running the profiler didn&#x27;t illuminate anything useful.
 I&#x27;ve eliminated there being something in my configuration since the issue persists even when I run emacs with the -Q flag. Of note for my system I&#x27;m running on wayland. I&#x27;ll post an update when I&#x27;m able to test on Xorg.
 Are there some packages that I might be missing on my system? Or some configuration options I might be missing?
 Thanks a million for the help!
 update issue appears on the same machine running xorg.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have an orgmode file to host all my personal notes.
 I want to archive all DONE taks in the same file.
 For now I have an header called Archived and I move the done tasks to there but I wanted to make this semi automatic (lets say I execute a command and that is moved to that header).
 Is there a way to do this?
 ​
 Bellow is my orgmode config
 ​
 ;; org-mode (advice-add &#x27;org-archive-subtree :after #&#x27;org-save-all-org-buffers) (setq org-todo-keywords &#x27;( (sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;STARTED(s)&quot; &quot;WAITING(w)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot; &quot;CANCELED(c)&quot;) )) (setq org-todo-keyword-faces &#x27;((&quot;TODO&quot; .

                              <span>Based on my understanding, compile it without sudo might be a safer option. I recall that when I used the sudo installation of Emacs, the old binaries remained even after I removed Emacs with sudo make uninstall, make clean and make distclean.
 This is the way I compile Emacs right now: (Notice, I&#x27;m using sudo make install)
 $ ./autogen.sh $ ./configure --without-compress-install --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-mailutils --with-tree-sitter CC&#x3D;gcc-12 $ make -j 4 $ sudo make install 
 If I were able to compile it in the home folder, I believe it would be safer in the sense that it wouldn&#x27;t interfere with any system libraries, right? And it would be easier to uninstall, correct?

 The emacs conf do use doom-modeline and all-the-icons. Of course this do not work correct. And I understand why.

 Is there a way to work around that? Does doom-modeline has a config switch to use something different than all-the-icons?

 (let-alist json-alist (let-alist (aref .choices 0) .message.content)) 
 Now, I wondered if there is something like https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/get-in (example: (get-in json-alist [&quot;choices&quot; 0 &quot;message&quot; &quot;content&quot;])) which reads a lot nicer? It&#x27;s mostly about mixing vectors and alists.
 I tried -let but I couldn&#x27;t make it work in a single statement.
 Thanks :)

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread. Add to this thread by telling us what is happening in and around your ZK journey. Join the community and enlighten us about your knowledge path trajectory. I do this for selfish reasons. It helps me clarify my goals and visualize my thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks an idea worth exploring.
Ideas I&#x27;m thinking about:
My life is slowly imploding.
How I can be compassionate to myself. Let the breath coddle, hug, nurture, and fill me with wonder.
The tutoring possibilities of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT.
Blogging my notes.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Lispector, Clarice and Costa, Margaret Jull and Patterson, Robin and Valente, Paulo Gurgel. Too much of life: the complete crônicas. 2022.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
The 28-hour Jazz for Study Spotify playlist

                              <span>Hi folks, 
 When I use the mouse to close a tab on the tab-line, all works as expected. The context menu choice &quot;Close&quot; removes the tab from the tab-line and buries the buffer. 
 However, when I call tab-line-close-tab() with M-x, or from a keybinding, or by evaluating it in *scratch*, this error is returned: (args-out-of-range 0 0). 
 Here&#x27;s the relevant part of the backtrace: 
  
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (args-out-of-range 0 0) 
 tab-line--get-tab-property(tab nil) 
 tab-line-close-tab() 
 elisp--eval-last-sexp(t)
  
The Elisp for tab-line-close-tab() shows that it takes an optional argument, EVENT. I&#x27;m wondering this: if I provided an argument to EVENT, an argument to indicate something other than a mouse click, would the function then work? 
 The Elisp for tab-line-close-tab() is …</span>

                              <span>(I&#x27;m starting to realize and accept that certain agree I am handicapped and I&#x27;m really losing the ability to type consistently with my right hand. I&#x27;m also finding Voice control and dictation software to be severely lacking. But I do feel like with the right Emacs set up I should be able to do more with less)
 Has anyone had success using emacs to help deal with their RSI? On a basic level I&#x27;m thinking of things like auto capitalizing sentences after. Or some kind of English friendly hippie expand to auto complete words using context. In the dream version maybe you can occasionally dictate words and then feed that through Local LLM to fix up the inevitable problems. Also, personally, something like a super abbreviation module that was great at auto completing words or guessing it words only using the left side of a split keyboard.
 The ultimate irony here is I&#x27;d love to take on some of these projects myself, but I can&#x27;t effectively type anymore. Sad panda. After a few days of rest I&#x27;m able to test new keyboard, I got excited for a few hours, and then spend the rest of the day watching the pain in my right forearm intensify. I&#x27;m hoping to get up to some base level of functionality using existing tools that I can use the bootstrap my own development.
 Anyway, if there&#x27;s anything you know of or directions you can put me in I greatly appreciate it.
 (if my current depression is coming through this post please excuse me, chronic pain is just a bitch and AA so when you can&#x27;t do any of the things that you would normally do to take your mind off it. I guess I should be happy voice control works on this iPad at all, I just wish it was better and hooked up to a local LLM. Peace)

                              <span>So I was using Emacs 25 on Windows 10 and I had a macro saved in my .emacs. The macro basically executed &quot;run-python&quot; and then maximised the buffer in which the python shell opens. It worked fine on Emacs 25, but after I updated to version 29.1.2, I am getting the following error message 
 kmacro-exec-ring-item: Invalid function: ([134217848 114 117 110 45 112 121 116 104 111 ...] 0 &quot;%d&quot;)

 ideally a keypress for opening up an hydra menu and selecting from them a file I want to open. How would I go about this? I am new to elisp.

I am wondering if there is a way to basically make a block generate a shell prompt (just a $ would be enough) where I can input a command, run it w/ C-c C-c and have the output appear inside the block, below it w/out a prompt, or maybe just writing a command to run a shell command at the point if it is in one of these blocks. Any help is appreciated.

 And in any case, what is the built-in Evil keypress to follow links in documentation? C-c C-o does work in org-mode, but it does not work in Emacs documentation.
 Thank you!

But when org-src-preserve-indentation is set to t (to solve some indentation issues) the results are not exported anymore (but the code blocks are). Any idea why?

                              <span>Hi ... absolute emacs fan here (using emacs solely to write prose) and now that I updated to 29 (macOS) I encounter a strange problem in org-mode: return doesn&#x27;t work at the end of an org-headline when folded, it&#x27;s just stuck. Normally placing point behind ellipsis and then hitting return would just place point at the beginning of the line below the headline (while it stays collapsed).
 Now point is stuck behind the ellipsis! Why?!
 Removed my complete config to test emacs out of the box and the problem ist still there and googled around but could not find anything about this problem.
 Is this a bug or something new that I don&#x27;t understand?
 Would be very thankful if somebody could tell me something about this.
 Thanks for reading.
 Many greetz
 Arthur

Charting a course toward a stable API for GHC by Alexis King
Our plan of attack is to start small. We cannot hope to address all the complex needs of, say, typechecker plugins or HLS right out of the gate, but we believe we can provide real, immediate utility to many existing tools.
Defeating Return Type Polymorphism by Philipp Hagenlocher
This post is an exploration of a generic technique to effectively circumvent return type polymorphism in Haskell programs using GADTs and existential quantification.

 Stan is a static analysis tool for Haskell. Its maintainers seem to have stopped supporting it after the GHC 8.x series because the GHC API changed too frequently for them to want to keep making adjustments.
 Last year I did quite a lot of work to bring Stan and its dependencies up to 9.4. I made a PR to the Stan Github repo last month:
 https://github.com/kowainik/stan/pull/506
 I haven’t heard anything from the maintainers.
 The only maintainer I know of is Veronika Romashkina. I’ve sent her a private email about this but had no response. Does anyone know how I can get in contact with Veronika or another Stan maintainer, if there is one?
 I would be willing to be a comaintainer for Stan and the rest of the Kowainik ecosystem (if only to make sure they continue to work with future GHCs).

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently exploring the integration of Azure services with Haskell for a production project. I&#x27;ve previously used &#x60;Amazonka&#x60;, the Haskell library for interacting with AWS services, and found it quite useful. The main services used are EC2, S3, Secrets Manager, SES (via Amazonka).
 I&#x27;m trying to port the above (working) Haskell-based backend to work in Azure.
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone has experience using Haskell to work with Azure services in a production (or test) environment. Specifically, I&#x27;m interested in hearing about:
  
Your experiences or challenges faced while integrating Azure services with Haskell
 Recommendations on Haskell libraries or tools that you found effective for interacting with Azure services, similar to how Amazonka is used for AWS.
  
Thanks in advance for your input! 😊

 And I can unwrap CPInfo respectively. But there are warnings: Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive. How can I get rid of these warnings.
 readConstUtf8 :: CPInfo -&gt; ConstantUtf8 readConstUtf8 cp &#x3D; let CU x &#x3D; cp in x readConstInteger :: CPInfo -&gt; ConstantInteger readConstInteger cp &#x3D; let CI x &#x3D; cp in x readConstFloat :: CPInfo -&gt; ConstantFloat readConstFloat cp &#x3D; let CF x &#x3D; cp in x 
 I can use typeOf to check the type, and there are no warnings. 
 I want to define a generic function like checkType to make readConstUtf8 as simple and pragmatic as readCU.
 checkType :: TypeRep -&gt; CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo checkType re cp &#x3D; if typeOf cp &#x3D;&#x3D; re then cp else error &quot;Unmatched type.&quot; readCU :: CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo readCU &#x3D; checkType $ typeOf CU readCI :: CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo readCI &#x3D; checkType $ typeOf CI readCF :: CPInfo -&gt; CPInfo readCF &#x3D; checkType $ typeOf CF

Let&#x27;s say I just read a passage on how to make a cake and create a number of highlights and comments. Now is the title &quot;how to make a cake&quot; a core idea? Or should I go into more detailed title like which flour should I buy or how do I use the oven? If I need to go to the detailed titles, does it mean I need to create a separate note for each title?

                              <span>As part of my ongoing quest to incorporate functionality from Excel-like programs into Org tables, I made company-org-table, a completion backend for Org table cells that mimics the auto-complete behavior of spreadsheet programs like Excel, LibreOffice, and Google Sheets: 
 https://github.com/shankar2k/company-org-table
 By default, the completion candidates are the contents of other cells in the same table column, but company-org-table can also be configured to dynamically generate candidates based on the table name and column header.
 The animation below illustrates company-org-table in action:
 Auto-completion in an Org table using company-org-table. Completion candidates in the first two columns are predefined lists, but in the second two columns are other table cells in the same column.
 I hope some of you find this useful!

                              <span>I have a java project (don&#x27;t be mean) im working on. Now, I really rely on the debugger to make sense of the janky code I wrote. Since im an advanced genius, my project uses java preview features. LSP correctly sets this up (due to it being specified in my pom.xml, I assume).
 When I try to start the debug using M-x dap-java-debug however, it wont run due to the missing --enable-preview-features flag.
 So i wrote a custom debug template that should fix this - only problem is, since I have already picked a debug template the first time I launched the debugger, I can&#x27;t figure out how to now switch to my new template. If it matters: im using doom.

                              <span>because org-capture automatically calls org-store-link, and because I have org-id-link-to-org-use-id set to t, sometimes when I do org-capture while the cursor is at the very top of an org file, for example a file like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +FILETAGS: :gtd:
  
task1 &#x60;&#x60; org would add aPROPERTIESdrawer before the#+FILETAGS: :gtd:line and add anID&#x60; property. I find this annoying because 1) I never link to files, always to headings 2) this looks ugly.
 
 Is there a way to configure org to not to do this? something like, please only create ID property for headings, not for files.

 Obviously, in some contexts, tab may do other things (like adjust indentation to different levels), but in this context, is there a way to make emacs intelligently understand that I would like it to code complete?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
This theme has been discussed previously, but I&#x27;m approaching it from the perspective of knowledge work and research. What are your personal views on AI, specifically ChatGPT and related models, in relation to how we engage with knowledge and conduct research?
Recently, I had the opportunity to work with ChatGPT-4. I&#x27;ve been inputting numerous academic papers for analysis and summarization. From my perspective, this is one of its most valuable applications. I&#x27;m exploring worlds of CFS and Fibromyalgia, and as someone who isn&#x27;t currently in academia (though I have past experience), ChatGPT has empowered me to undertake my own research. I believe I can do so reliably, evaluating various sources to draw practical, science-based conclusions. It has also allowed me to simplify complex topics by explaining concepts in clear, jargon-free language.
A couple of additional questions: Are there any drawbacks to this approach? How do you engage with these models, if at all?</span>

                              <span>Hi! So, part of my bachelor’s thesis is basically running a CNN over some images that can hold letters, numbers, and a couple of logic symbols. This being my first time ever handling an ML task, I wanted to go safe with pytorch.
 The thing is, I’m having a couple of type issues with the library, and I don’t really understand much about what the functions should get as input, or what they return… So, I thought that maybe a more statically typed programming language might help, hopefully, my favorite one :).
 I’m looking for library recommendations that:
  
Allows me to write a simple CNN at first (like LeNET) and then maybe jump into other architectures (AlexNet maybe?)
 
Can run on an AMD Radeon GPU
 
Runs on windows? (not mandatory, but desirable since my it’s my tutors OS)
 
 Thanks in advanced

 I am trying to find a way to archive todo tasks in to a separate todo-archive.org file, but preserve the sub tree structure above, so for example if I archive Task 5, it will be archived in the following way, showing both the level 1 and 2 sub trees:
 * Project 1 ** Sub Project 2 *** DONE Task 5 
 I already tried adding another :ARCHIVE: property like this:
  :PROPERTIES: :ARCHIVE: todo-archive.txt::* Project 1/Sub Project 2 :END: 
 However this doesn&#x27;t work.
 Does anyone know of a solution?

                              <span>Using Doom Emacs. My modifications basically include
  
Adding packages to packages.el and
 I have defined my org directory in config.el
 I have defined custom todo keywords in config.el
 additionally I have created functions within my config.el to create org-ql queries which are relatively straight forward - basically sorting the above defined custom keywords in a view.
  
Configuration:
 GNU Emacs v29.1 nil
 Doom core v3.0.0-pre HEAD -&gt; master 844a82c4 2023-09-22 23:18:31 +0200
 Doom modules v23.09.0-pre HEAD -&gt; master 844a82c4 2023-09-22 23:18:31 +0200
 Issue:
 This whole setup was working wonderfully till about 2 weeks ago when I am not if I modified something by mistake or if it was because I ran doom upgrade.
 Now every time I try to call the function, I get : Error running timer ‘org-reveal’: (error &quot;‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer # (+doom-dashboard-mode)&quot;) [19 times]
 I have nuked my doom directory and reinstalled, yet I still get the same error. I furthermore tried starting emacs with &quot;emacs -Q&quot; and then inserting &quot;:org-mode&quot; but that also gives me the same error. What am I missing here?

                              <span>Thanks to the help of more experienced developers (/u/nalisarc and more people on Github whose Reddit username(s) if any I don&#x27;t know), orgmunge is now on PyPi. You can find it here. The Github repo can be found here. Feedback and contributions welcome.
 My hope in building this project is that it will be a base for people to build other things on top of it that involve programmatically editing Org files.

                              <span>Hi all. It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but I recently released Orgro 1.33.3 with simple editing support.
 At the moment you can:
  
Toggle list item checkboxes
 Cycle the TODO status on headlines
 Undo/redo changes
 Auto-save the edited document back to the original file, or if permissions don&#x27;t allow, then you will be prompted to share or discard the document
  
I&#x27;ve added lots of other improvements as well; see the changelog for details.
 I&#x27;m still thinking about other kinds of editing operations and how they can be exposed comfortably in a mobile UI (especially one that tries to mimic the &quot;native&quot; appearance of an Org Mode doc in Emacs). If you have ideas, suggestions, or other feedback, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.
 A final thing to mention is that I&#x27;m still a bit worried about Orgro making unwanted changes to files when saving them. I tried hard to be able to write files back verbatim (modulo edits), but if you notice any incidental changes then please report them.

                              <span>Can anyone give an overview of how to install treesitter for org-mode? I attempted via this package (https://github.com/milisims/tree-sitter-org) but it seems to be oriented towards Neovim, and I&#x27;m not sure what the actual process would be for installing a non-standard treesitter grammar. 
 I&#x27;m open to other ideas or avenues as well, this just seemed like the most complete option. Thanks in advance!

 +PROPERTY: CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL current
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; To the beginning of the file. But it doesn&#x27;t have an effect. What am I missing here?
 Edit:
 I think I figured it out: org-use-property-inheritance needs to be set to non-nil.

 i find my self doing M-x and then searching for the command, sometimes there is a keybind that i will remember, but sometimes there is none, so is there a way to add a keybind to something directly from there? if not, then what is the easiest way to do so?

 ​
 ■ Error (use-package): doom-modeline/:init: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, compat

 ■ Error (use-package): doom-modeline/:catch: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, compat
 ​
 Does anyone know what this means? Everything works fine on my other computer. 
 I am using the emacs-git version on arch linux (30 something)
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Is there an reliable way to have Emacs keybindings in the jupyter notebooks?
 Unfortunately, I cannot use emacs-jupyter because I am working on an assignment that uses animations. I tried ein but it does not produce animations. I am using Firenvim + neovim right now and while very useful I have issues with the editor size and position in the browser page. 
 I think that the best thing would be to have Emacs keybindings in the text areas. Is there any way to setup this in a reliable way? Some of the shortcuts are reserved by Firefox, such as Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, Ctrl-f etc.
 I am using Sway, so emacs-everywhere does not work.
 Thank you for any suggestion or pointers.

 I don&#x27;t care about vim, but i just want to learn vim keybindings (so that i can use it in a way you use internet explorer to install chrome/Firefox)
 Yesterday i wanted to use vim, but i was facing some problems (you can see my history), and after that i tried emacs (doom) and it worked like a charm, but i just want to know evil-mode keybindings, so is the game good to learn it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using centaur emacs which has dump-jump by default.
 I tried dump-jump on simple &quot;hello world&quot; and other cpp project and it doesn&#x27;t work. Definition is not found. 
 I tried on pop-os(emacs 29) and ubuntu(emacs 27). 
 ripgrep is installed on the PC.
 I tried to force it to be used with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher &#x27;rg) and (setq dumb-jump-prefer-searcher &#x27;rg) 
 I added (add-hook &#x27;xref-backend-functions #&#x27;dumb-jump-xref-activate) to use M-. 
 Also, put a .projectile and .dumbjump 
 I saw nothing with set-variable dumb-jump-debug t 
 I was expected it work easily because the search is with ripgrep only. 
 What could be wrong ?

                              <span>I use doom Emacs and it works well. Always I use multi frames for multi-tasks. Recently I find there is a few seconds stuck to show point of cursor in new frame when switch between frames, for example 2~3 seconds, so I will wait a few seconds after switch frames by &quot;Alt + Tab&quot;. Sometimes it feels bothered. Any clue to debug or tune this stuck? Thanks

                              <span>If any of you get sick of trying to scroll entire pages at once using C-v and M-v try adding this to your init file:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-.&quot;) &#x27;scroll-up-line)
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-,&quot;) &#x27;scroll-down-line)
 C-. and C-, feel pretty natural, and they aren&#x27;t bound by default. scroll-up-line and scroll-down-line aren&#x27;t bound by default either, and they&#x27;re nice cause they move the screen up or down a line instead of an entire page.

 new blog post about the spec, by Sébastien Doeraene of the Scala Center: https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2023/09/25/work-in-progress-scala-3-specification.html
  
Now that the foundations are laid out, we decided to publish our work-in-progress specification. However, much remains to be done. In the coming months, we will integrate the missing pieces we mentioned at the beginning of this post.
 In the meantime, this specification can already serve as a reference for many core aspects of Scala 3.

                              <span>Hi there, I just had a question I wonder if someone could help me with.
 I recently came across The Guardian newspaper&#x27;s style guide checker, and thought something similar could be really useful to me in my work. The code for the project is open source on Github, so in theory it should be doable. However, apparently most of it is in Scala, and my programming experience is already very limited to basically only some beginner Python.
 How doable would it be to use The Guardian&#x27;s code as a base to create something similar myself, given this background? I&#x27;m willing to invest time and learning into it, but just wanted to ascertain the scale of the undertaking before committing to that.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any opinions or advice on this. Thank you very much!

                              <span>What I&#x27;m trying to do is to export an .ics file daily that can be imported to Google Calendar so that I can view all unfinished TODOs on my phone. In Emacs, I have org-agenda show the unfinished TODOs on today&#x27;s view. How can I achieve this when exporting to iCalendar?
 I&#x27;m currently using org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files to export the TODOs from all my agenda files. I don&#x27;t want to reschedule the TODOs to today, as many of them are recurring items and I don&#x27;t want the next repeat time to be based on today when I do mark them as DONE.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve just installed GHC 9.6.2 with &#x60;stack --resolver nightly-2023-09-26&#x60;.
 Previously, the GHC docs were installed along with GHC, but this doesn&#x27;t seem the case anymore: I can&#x27;t find the &quot;users_guide&quot; docs anywhere on my disk now. I did find the docs for the libraries and also for base, but the users guide seems to be absent.
 Has it not been packaged with the new GHC version, or am I missing a setting for stack? :)
 Could I download the docs separately from somewhere else? I can only find an online version and don&#x27;t want to use some kind of crawler.
 Regards,
 Hai

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use dependent types to make my code more typesafe and concise, while also being able to express precise invariants for it. One problem, though, is that I want, at some point, to read a list, which was previously saved to a files, that has it&#x27;s type parameterized to a Dependent Sum. The following example closely resembles code I&#x27;m writing at the moment (as this is an example, I don&#x27;t know if all pragmas need to compile the following are included in here. Please shout me out if corrections are needed):
 {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} import Data.Kind (Type) import Numeric.Natural (Natural) type Alt :: FooType -&gt; a -&gt; b type family Alt a b where Alt &#x27;Foo1 a &#x3D; a Alt &#x27;Foo2 a &#x3D; () data FooType &#x3D; Foo1 | Foo2 deriving (Show, Read) data SFooType :: FooType -&gt; Type where SFoo1 :: SFooType &#x27;Foo1 SFoo2 :: SFooType &#x27;Foo2 data Bar :: FooType -&gt; Type where Bar :: forall (s :: FooType). {a :: Alt s Integer, b :: Alt s Natural} -&gt; Bar s deriving instance Show (Bar &#x27;Foo1) deriving instance Show (Bar &#x27;Foo2) deriving instance Read (Bar &#x27;Foo1) deriving instance Read (Bar &#x27;Foo2) data SomeBar :: Type where SomeBar :: forall (s :: FooType). SFooType s -&gt; Bar s -&gt; SomeBar instance Show SomeBar where show (SomeBar s b) &#x3D; case s of SFoo1 -&gt; show @(Bar &#x27;Foo1) b SFoo2 -&gt; show @(Bar &#x27;Foo2) b 
 As you can see, I could figure out how to write show instances for a dependent sum. Read instances, though, are not as straight forward. I&#x27;ve tried, without success, to write an instance for it on my own.
 Now I want to hear from you. Am I approaching this from the wrong angle? If not, what would you suggest I do to make this possible?
 Thanks in advance, guys.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think my title explains this well. Basically, what I mean is that, as also the case with jupyter notebooks, if I am doing an analysis and I run a cell which updates a variable itself in a self-referential way, without forgetting to run the cell where it was initialized, I get the wrong output. Is there a way to make sure one if I run an src block that depends on another src block, that the dependent src block will run before the one that I am currently running. I realize, I would need to manually tie these together. I feel like something could be done w/ the preamble attribute and writing an elisp function that just runs another src block, but I don&#x27;t know how that elisp function would look. As an MWE, I imagine the functionality kind of looking like...
 #+name: initialize #+begin_src python x &#x3D; 5 #+end_src #+begin_src python :preamble (call_src &quot;initialize&quot;) x+&#x3D;1 #+end_src 
 I tried...
 (defun call_src (name) (org-babel-goto-named-src-block name) (org-babel-execute-src-block)) 
 but it seemed not to load the variables before running the cell (possibly because I am using Jupyter-Emacs w/ asynchronous src blocks). 
 Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>Background bits: I&#x27;m running 29.1 on a Mac (Big Sur) and installed Emacs via homebrew, and I use completely vanilla Emacs with my own config. For email I use Apple&#x27;s Mail app and a slip of a finger earlier today just revealed to me that for some reason basic Emacs keybindings are working when composing a message. C-n, C-p, C-a, C-e, C-f, C-b etc. 
 I have absolutely no clue why this should be the case, what I may have installed and forgot about, or how to go about finding out what&#x27;s going on. I assume there is an embarrassing and simple explanation that is hiding in plain sight? Thanks in advance for the pointers!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am newcomer to both Emacs and C++ so please be patient. I am trying to set up eglot + clangd. I have this in my config:
 (require &#x27;eglot)
 (add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((c++-mode c-mode) &quot;clangd&quot;))
 (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure)
 (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook &#x27;eglot-ensure)
 and I have followed the instructions at https://clangd.llvm.org/installation and have version 12.0.1-19ubuntu3 of clangd installed.
 The project I am working on right now is compiled using CMake so I have also created &quot;compile_commands.json&quot; succesfully using cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS&#x3D;1 which should be loaded correctly as the *Eglot stderr* buffer gives me &quot;Loaded compilation database from ....&quot;
 However, several definitions using xref are not working, I just get &quot;No definitions found for: LSP identifier at point&quot;, and when I try to eglot-rename a variable I get &quot;jsonrpc-error: &quot;request id&#x3D;85 failed:&quot;, (jsonrpc-error-code . -32001), (jsonrpc-error-message . &quot;Cannot rename symbol: there is no symbol at the given location&quot;), (jsonrpc-error-data)&quot;. 
 Can somebody guide me in how to properly set up eglot + clangd or help me figuring out what is wrong?
 Thanks a bunch!

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am using emacs to view csv files, using the command ~csv-align-mode~. Now I have a problem with the header line: the line is far longer than what my screen allows to display, and I do not want the line to be continued as a second visual line, since it makes the align function useless.
 Instead I want to have to scroll right, in order to see the fields on the right.
 I guess I have to play with a kind of ~fill-column~ or ~auto-fill-mode~ but I do not understand the many finesses of these options.
 is there any visual post (with Screenshots and examples) explaining how to set this right?

                              <span>Hey fellow org-mode enthusiasts,
 I&#x27;m currently working on customizing my org-mode setup, and I&#x27;ve run into a little snag with Treemacs. I would like to have Treemacs display the #+title:property of my org files instead of the file name in the directory tree.
 I&#x27;ve scoured the documentation and tried various configurations, but I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve this. Has anyone successfully done this before or has any ideas on how to accomplish it?
 Here&#x27;s an example of what I mean:
 org code:
 #+TITLE: Project XYZ * My Awesome Project ** Task 1 ** Task 2 
 In Treemacs, instead of seeing &quot;My_Project.org,&quot; I would like it to display &quot;Project XYZ&quot; for that entry.
 The reason that i ask for this is that i am using OrgRoam and the file names start with a pretty large id.
 Any guidance, tips, or even pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

 On a personal note, this was my first time executing the rather lengthy and finicky GHC release process. I took a ton of notes and hopefully I will be able to smooth off a lot of the rough edges before the next release cycle.

 also the official ones don&#x27;t mention in the description what version they cover. 
 Is this about ZIO2? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wsTIcHxJMeQ&amp;t&#x3D;1s 
 just want to avoid learning old content.
 thank you :)

 I have to write a status report every two weeks that follows a specific format. I have created a template file for this. I would like to:
  
Prompt myself for a date using the calendar
 Create a file based on this date that I picked
 Use the selected date again in the template file to interpolate the date again
 Write this to the file created in step 2.
 Stretch goal: put the cursor in the first section. (I have %? in the template)
 I would like to have the capture template opened wherein I can ctrl+c ctrl+k to abandon
  
After having spent yesterday trying to accomplish this, I tried ChatGPT today. That didn’t go well.

 My intention for this thread is as a sort of knowledge-sharing. I know for me, I wished I had discovered the above a lot earlier.

                              <span>I want to move point forward one line in a buffer other than the current one. This is part of a package I&#x27;m writing, so I&#x27;m talking about doing this programmatically, in code. My instinct is to use forward-line inside a call to with-current-buffer. My code didn&#x27;t work and I&#x27;ve isolated the problem -- my call to &#x60;forward-line&#x27; doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve tested outside the program and the same thing happens. Try the following code in a buffer other than scratch:
 (with-current-buffer &quot;*scratch*&quot; (forward-line)) 
 It should switch temporarily to scratch, call forward-line and switch back. It doesn&#x27;t do anything on my machine, even with emacs -q (no personal config file).
 I&#x27;m on 30.0.50.
 TIA!

 &quot;Stay in search mode in Vim by using ctrl-g and ctrl-t&quot;
 It&#x27;s very promising, but it&#x27;s not implemented by default.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been exploring Vim for the past 2 months, and i decided to invest sometime to learn my editor instead of relying on other people&#x27;s configs. It turns out to be quite complicated, so i decided that i would rather invest that time and effort in something like emacs. I tried doom for a few days, but i couldn&#x27;t get anything near the experience i had in Vim. i couldn&#x27;t even enable syntax highlighting for the different programming languages i use, so i would like to ask for any helpful resources about how to configure emacs as an IDE, videos, articles, books, well documented configs would be helpful Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s possible to use dir-locals, projectile, or some other scheme in order to map major modes to certain file types conditionally. Specifically, when working on static site generator projects, I routinely need markdown files to not only use web-mode (which I wouldn&#x27;t normally use for markdown), but I need web-mode to set its templating language to something specific. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to do this. With dir-locals, I&#x27;m afraid modifying the auto-mode-alist would leave it in a bad state if and when I move onto a different repo. Meanwhile, projectile doesn&#x27;t seem to have a clean way to hook into changing project types (unless you do it manually). Any suggestions?

                              <span>Merchants and traders have a waste book (Sudelbuch, Klitterbuch in German I believe) in which they enter daily everything they purchase and sell, messily, without order. From this, it is transferred to their journal, where everything appears more systematic, and finally to a ledger, in double entry after the Italian manner of bookkeeping, where one settles accounts with each man, once as debtor and then as creditor. This deserves to be imitated by scholars. First it should be entered in a book in which I record everything as I see it or as it is given to me in my thoughts; then it may be entered in another book in which the material is more separated and ordered, and the ledger might then contain, in an ordered expression, the connection sand explanations of the material that flow from it.…</span>

2.12: https://tpolecat.github.io/2017/04/25/scalac-flags.html
 
2.13: https://nathankleyn.com/2019/05/13/recommended-scalac-flags-for-2-13/
 
 Has anyone published a list of flags for Scala 3? (Scala 3.3).
 Last time I used Scala 3 (3.0), a lot of options were missing. Has Scala 3.3 bridge the gap?
 I&#x27;m planning to try to upgrade one of our projects at work but looking for feedbacks on this before. A lot of these flags are mandatory to get the full power/safety of Scala IMHO.

                              <span>I have been using C++ (and some C#) professionally for about 5 years and enjoy it immensely. My next project is in Scala. What are some good resources targeted to folks with a native C++ programming background? I am particularly interested in understanding the nitty gritty of what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes.
 FWIW, I used to write a lot of Java in college.

                              <span>Hi all, Yesterday I asked you guys a question about cats vs native Scala. Thanks for your answers! They were all awesome!
 I spent few hours checking the job market for Scala jobs in Data Engineering (I&#x27;m a Data Engineer). But daaaaaaamn I really thought Scala/Spark was way more a thing! It&#x27;s really all PySpark now. What a disappointment 😢 Especially with Scala 3, honestly any data engineer who knows Python could easily write Spark job in Scala. 
 Hard to find the motivation to keep learning FP in Scala when the Scala opportunities are so limited. I guess it will teach me FP so that&#x27;s good. But there&#x27;s a depressing vibe to it.
 I guess only very big tech companies or banks or companies still relying on a on-premise infra may still use Scala.

                              <span>I want to add stack trace support for debugging purposes. I downloaded the GHC bindist (Fedora 33 with DWARF support) from the GHC download website and followed the instructions in the INSTALL file. I executed ./configure --prefix&#x3D;/home/user/ghc and then ran make install. The installation seemed to succeed, but when I ran ghc --info | grep libdw, it returned ,(&quot;RTS expects libdw&quot;,NO).
 What did I miss? Do I need to manually compile GHC from source instead?
 Thanks

 My question is: What is this actually doing? What is the purpose? Does it just highlight, that&#x27;s it? If so, why did they add it?

                              <span>Is there a way to dynamically filter an agenda by todo state? For example , if my agenda shows items in TODO, WAITING, and DONE states, I&#x27;d like to press a key to filter it down to just the WAITING states - similar to org-agenda-filter-by-tag, etc, but for todo states.
 I realize I can use org-agenda-custom-commands to create canned commands of items in a certain todo state, but I&#x27;d like to be able to do it dynamically.
 Thanks!

                              <span>A few days ago my package llm was added to GNU ELPA. This package isn&#x27;t for end-users, it&#x27;s for others who are writing llm-based functionality to do so in a way that is agnostic of the llm backend. That way the user can use the LLM they have access to. LLMs are &quot;large language models&quot;, very large systems that are able to deal with natural language with surprising naturalness.
 To start, we provide functionality for creating embeddings, and for LLM chat, in both sync and async versions. There are only two providers to start with: Open AI and Google Cloud Vertex. There&#x27;s obviously more that are possible, such as Anthropic&#x27;s API, or Llama 2.
 The difficulties with providing an interface to Llama 2, by the way, is that there seem to be a lot of different ways to install and use it, so it isn&#x27;t clear that there&#x27;s a good interface I could provide that would be widely useful. But it&#x27;s pretty easy to write your own, and maybe I&#x27;ll provide an interface that just goes to some command-line utility and executes it.
 If you are an author of a package that does something with LLMs, I&#x27;d encourage you to use this package, so your users can have some control of what backend they are using. And if you want to help expand the number of LLMs we have access to, please send a pull request if you have FSF papers. This is a GNU project, so FSF papers are required for substantial contributions.

                              <span>MisTTY is a major mode for Emacs 29.1 and up that runs a shell inside of a buffer. It is built on top of term.el. It is available on MELPA. Check out its project page at https://github.com/szermatt/mistty.
 Such a buffer feels very much like comint mode: you can move around freely and run any Emacs command you want - until you press TAB and end up with the native completion or notice the shell autosuggestions. With MisTTY you have access to both Emacs and the shell commands and editing tools.
 Additionally, commands that take over the entire screen, such as less or vi also work, temporarily taking over the window, while scrollback remains available in another buffer.
 MisTTY works well with Bash and ZSH, but it is especially well suited to running the Fish shell; you get autosuggestions, and completions in full colors.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a theme with a few specific qualities, and was wondering if anyone might have some suggestions. Basically, here are my requirements:
  
Dark them with black background
 Predominantly white text
 Fairly high contrast, but with a subtle colour palette
  
I find a lot of dark themes are either low contrast, or the colour palette is mainly based on simple bright primary colours which I personally dislike.
 Anyone use a theme that sounds like it might fit the bill?

                              <span>Recently I declared init bankruptcy, upgraded to emacs 29 and configured for my webdev needs from scratch. 
 About 75% of my configuration was plain sailing. Most of the remaining 25% is related to completions. 
 One massive problem I have is the *completions* minibuffer. I hate it. 
 I don&#x27;t want a minibuffer for completions. I&#x27;m trying to bend company to my needs. But the *completions* minibuffer pops up anyway. And when it does, it is very intrusive. It changes the layout of my frames. And when I make it go away, the buffer that I&#x27;m working in is repositioned. 
 At the moment, it is the bane of my workflow. I&#x27;m working on a complex set of problems that require a lot of focus. And having my frames re-arranged unpredictably messes with my head. 
 My understanding is that the *completions* minifbuffer can&#x27;t be removed. Is there a way to prevent it from being invoked?

                              <span>I remember seeing someone put at the top of their init file something like:  ;; --:**-- init.el -- ;; Code:  so I did the same in mine. Just now, I saw that it said Elisp/d in my mode line, and the d was highlighted. I clicked it, and I got a comment -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- at the top of my file, and it said it enabled lexical binding.
 What are these special comments? It seems suspiciously similar to the above that I mentioned in seeing someone&#x27;s init file (whose style I copied) and it has an actual effect (when removed, the Elisp/d comes back instead of Elisp/l). Is there docs on these?
 Stylistically, these make me recall the sh shebangs, like #!/bin/sh.

                              <span>I just bisected my init file to find this issue, but doing (tool-bar-mode -1) causes a flash of white (regular emacs theme) or flash of theme-color (if do it after initialize your theme) and makes the emacs GUI hang for about half a second. I am running on macOS. Does anyone else have this issue? Should this be reported as a bug? In the meantime, I&#x27;ve put this in my early-init.el.
 edit: the same issue occurs with (scroll-bar-mode -1).

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to turn any key combination into a modifier key for example holding C-v would rebind a set of keys like hydra.el and releasing it would return to the regular keymap. I found key-chord which somewhat emulates the functionality I need, but I want something easier/simpler to execute. 
 What are some ways I could let emacs know a key has been released even if it only works in the GUI version?
 (I&#x27;m using Debian Linux)

                              <span>hello guys, its me ya boi again 
 I&#x27;m new to Haskell and this subreddit. I was reading Learn You a Haskell and stumbled across this operator -: here, 
  
Haskell ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0))) (3,1)  When we apply the function landLeft 1 to (0,0) we get (1,0). Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting in (1,1). Finally two birds land on the left side, resulting in (3,1). We apply a function to something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we make a function like this: haskell x -: f &#x3D; f x  We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function: haskell ghci&gt; 100 -: (*3) 300 ghci&gt; True -: not False ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 2 (2,0)  By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable manner: haskell ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2 (3,1) 
  
according to my expert research at this point in time there was no pipe operator in Haskell, so I looked up and found this page.
 here two operators are mentioned -: and :-, used together, could allow us also use expression in infix notation, instead of just functions.
 I checked in ghci and there are no such operators available. are these old operators that were removed? what&#x27;s their story?

                              <span>Hi all. I&#x27;m a noob Haskeller, 1 week experience.
 I was using GHC and a Makefile to compile and run and making a new file for every &quot;day&quot;. Eventually I wanted to use splitOn so I made a cabal project. Then I found out it automatically loads your modules into the repl with cabal repl which is sick. 
 Unfortunately I&#x27;m trying to work in modules/day3.hs and import rund3 to Main.hs and run it. However Cabal can&#x27;t see my non exported functions inside modules/day3.hs. this is a bit unfortunate.
 Solution I can think of is working inside Main then transferring to a different file when I&#x27;m done but maybe there&#x27;s a totally different set up that works better?

                              <span>hi, im new to Haskell and I wanted to install it and run a simple hello world program in intellij.
 However I cannot get it to compile and run in IntelliJ.
 It&#x27;s possible with the ghci console, but I am used to just click the run symbol in IntelliJ and it compiles (also for debugging). 
 I already installed the Haskell plugin for it (https://github.com/rikvdkleij/intellij-haskell/blob/master/README.md) and stack is installed via ghcup. 
 ​
 This is how it looks in IntelliJ:

                              <span>I gave Scala a try today and find everything slow to start. Running scala a.scala takes 2 seconds before seeing the Hello World message. Formatting in VSCode using scalafmt takes 30 seconds to finish. Running sbt takes a while before it reports error (this is because of scala slowness I guess?). Is this situation normal or I get something wrong with my setup?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I have a Java and Python background.
 I used Scala before to develop Spark jobs. That being said I haven&#x27;t dug too deep into the FP aspects of Scala.
 I&#x27;m planning to learn more in-depth about FP in Scala.
 After I understand the FP basics, would you recommend I dive into cats or perhaps it&#x27;s advisable to have some experience with &quot;native&quot; Scala first before digging into Cats or ZIO?
 I have no clue how overwhelming those libraries can be for a developer with very limited experience with FP. 
 Thanks again!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a novice using scala, but I&#x27;ve been programming with other languages for a while. I really enjoy writing SQL and type safe code. When using OCaml, this library is great: https://github.com/darioteixeira/pgocaml
 It uses a PPX macro which reads the raw SQL string before compilation and asks Postgres server for the data type which will be returned when the SQL would actually be executed. This way OCaml knows the return type of each SQL query even if they are just pure SQL.
 Is there anything similar for Scala? I searched quickly for Scala SQL libraries but they don&#x27;t seem to provide both raw SQL usage and high type safety.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a report generator that consists of a table with links. While I&#x27;d normally use groff because it has no dependencies and plays well with shell pipelines, mixing tables and links in groff barely works so I was going to generate LaTeX instead.
 Possibly interesting idea: have an org-mode literate program with code that generates other org-mode programs that ultimately end up as exportable in various forms using Make and emacs-lisp called in batch mode.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a long writing piece which I&#x27;d like to organize and edit in Emacs, but large swathes of it have already been written in LibreOffice Writer. There are plenty of italics and bolded keywords throughout the text and I can&#x27;t find an easy, pre-existing way to preserve them in Org mode markup.
 So far it seems the easiest means of automating this would be to dump the clipboard contents to an HTML file or other suitable in between and then write a script to process it into Org mode markup, but that seems ludicrous. I&#x27;d use Bash because that&#x27;s what I know—I can&#x27;t find a preexisting solution in Emacs elisp. There is a very, very old .odt importer called odt2org and it requires a now obsolete version of Python which I&#x27;d like to avoid setting up. 
 Literally copy/yanking the text from Writer into a text-file, and manually copying the italics would be faster. Am I missing something? I see lots about exporting from Emacs, but what about preserving formatting into Emacs? If there&#x27;s a means which includes formatting headers, block quotes into #+begin_quote/#+end_quote tags etc, that&#x27;d be perfect but I&#x27;ll settle for just italics and bold.

                              <span>In his 1981 paper, Stallman notes: 
 &quot;EMACS stood for Editing Macros, before we realized that EMACS is composed of functions written in a programming language rather than macros in editor TECO&quot;.
 Should Emacs have been named Efuns?

                              <span>Ironically my Emacs journey started out not touching the Easy Customization Interface at all and has progressed to using it frequently. It occurred to me that It would a more pleasant UX experience if I could modify .dir-locals.el using the Easy Customization Interface. Does this already exist? Conceptually it doesn&#x27;t seem hard to implement so I feel like I&#x27;m just searching for the wrong terms.

 Usually， I work with swiper to search, ivy-occur to freeze the results in mini-buffer, then C-x C-q makes it editable for further actions.
 How could get such a workflow done with “M-x occur&quot; result?

                              <span>So I wanted to know what day it will be 49 days from now. Was sure Calendar could help me on that, and so M-x calendar.
 After much documentation reading and searching I ended up using C-u 49 C-f to move the cursor 49 days forward. How clever! 🤓
 Similarly, we can also use: - C-n, forward week - M-}, forward month - C-x ], forward year

E.g when a curly bracket is created it auto puts the closing one which is great. When I press enter it aligns it down nut right under e.g the if keyword. It would look like this:
 If () {
  }
 Are there packages for proper indentation for programming languages?

 Hi, I&#x27;m learning React 18 using ScalaJS 1.13.2 and Slinky 0.7.4+1-e3ba8c29. I&#x27;m having a hard time trying to maintain state in a React context.
 For the snippet below, status seems to reset every time I navigate between pages. I expect the state not to be reset since I&#x27;m using state from a context.
 I appreciate any help fixing this.

                              <span>I am writing a big calculator. This calculator has many, many inputs and many, many outputs. My fundamental type is a Partner. Conceptually it makes sense to associate both inputs and outputs with a Partner. Also, some of the outputs are both important on their own and as inputs to later parts of the calculation.
 My question is: how do I architect this in Haskell? I can imagine having a big Partner record type that has a field for each input and each output. The downside of this is I&#x27;d have to initialize it with empty values for all the outputs. Would I then make those a Maybe type? That might get annoying.
 Do I instead define a separate type for each new output as it&#x27;s calculated? Say we start with just a PartnerInput object that only holds the inputs. Then we calculate the first output and put the result in a PartnerInputAndFirstOutput object. I.e. the first function has type PartnerInput -&gt; PartnerInputAndFirstOutput. Then the next function has type PartnerInputAndFirstOutput -&gt; PartnerInputAndSecondOutput, and so on. Intuitively this feels silly.
 Like any good Haskeller I want to use the type system to help guarantee the correctness of my code, but I can&#x27;t figure out how in this case. I&#x27;m interested to hear your thoughts.

 I noticed that in emacs 29 this pattern no longer works. Does anyone have any idea as to how I could get that functionality again?

                              <span>This release fixes the default face definitions so that it is easy on eyes. (I&#x27;m sorry to take too long to fix it, I didn&#x27;t notice it earlier.)
 IWindow is an interactive window choosing and switching package, similar to Ace Window. Why not Ace Window? Because I use EXWM, and Ace Window&#x27;s window highlighting (which uses Avy) doesn&#x27;t work with EXWM buffers. I needed something more customizable, and IWindow was borned. By default it uses mode line to show window selection keys.

                              <span>I defined a custom link for exporting subfigures in latex (source)
 (org-link-set-parameters &quot;subfig&quot; :follow (lambda (file) (find-file file)) ;; :face &#x27;(:foreground &quot;white&quot; :weight bold :underline t) :display &#x27;full :export (lambda (file desc backend) (when (eq backend &#x27;latex) (if (string-match &quot;&gt;(\\(.+\\))&quot; desc) (concat &quot;\\subcaptionbox{&quot; (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\s+&gt;(.+)&quot; &quot;&quot; desc) &quot;}&quot; &quot;{\\includegraphics&quot; &quot;[&quot; (match-string 1 desc) &quot;]&quot; &quot;{&quot; file &quot;}}\n\\quad\n&quot;) (format &quot;\\begin{subfigure}\\includegraphics{%s}\\end{subfigure}&quot; desc file))))) 
 With this, I can write in org mode...
 #+caption: Lorem impsum dolor #+attr_latex: :options \centering #+begin_figure [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C &gt;(width&#x3D;0.6\textwidth)]] #+end_figure 
 and have it transcoded to latex like...
 \begin{figure} \centering \subcaptionbox{Caption of A}{\includegraphics[width&#x3D;0.2\textwidth]{example-image-a}} \quad \subcaptionbox{Caption of B}{\includegraphics[width&#x3D;0.2\textwidth]{example-image-b}} \subcaptionbox{Caption of C}{\includegraphics[width&#x3D;0.2\textwidth]{example-image-c}} \quad \end{figure} 
 I am wondering if it is possible to automatically automatically wrap consecutive subfigures in a centered figure environment, and add the space separator between them, ie. I want to be able to write just...
 [[subfig:example-image-a][Caption of A &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-b][Caption of B &gt;(width&#x3D;0.3\textwidth)]] [[subfig:example-image-c][Caption of C &gt;(width&#x3D;0.6\textwidth)]] 
 and have it transcode the same way as it does above.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

 But I want the {} of the while loop to be under the while and not indented, like this:
 int main() { while (something) { do something; } return 0; } 
 Does anyone know how to edit aggressive-indent&#x27;s behaviour to do that?
 This is my current setup:
  (use-package aggressive-indent :ensure t :config (add-to-list &#x27;aggressive-indent-dont-indent-if &#x27;(and (derived-mode-p &#x27;c++-mode) (null (string-match &quot;\\([;{}]\\|\\b\\(if\\|for\\|while\\)\\b\\)&quot; (thing-at-point &#x27;line))))) (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook &#x27;aggressive-indent-mode))

                              <span>I was using Emacs 27.1 on Ubuntu recently, and then I made the switch to Debian 12 and Emacs 28.2. Emacs 28.2 gave me a ton of warnings about the packages I was using (managed with straight.el). I thought that was weird, so I built Emacs 29.1. All the warnings disappeared after that!
 I&#x27;m not an experienced user, so I wanted to ask here why some versions of Emacs seem to dislike my init.el and other versions are fine with it. Is there a way to avoid this in the future?

                              <span>I found this interesting concept on Howard Abrams&#x27; web page:
 https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/new-window-manager.html
 TLDR: he launches Emacs in fullscreen with xinitrc, but without EXWM. He uses xterm to start other applications such as firefox.
 I use Emacs with Sway, but I was wondering if anybody here is using Emacs as a window manager without EXWM or in some deeper synergy with some other minimal window manager. I have used EXWM and I already know what are the good and what are the bad parts. So I am interested in alternative ways in which Emacs can be used as a window manager.
 Another cool concept is here: http://perma-curious.eu/repo-ewx/
 Another window manager that could integrate well with Emacs, and perhaps even re-create the EXWM experience by writing some glue code in Elisp, could be river: https://github.com/riverwm/river
 I am collecting ideas so please feel free to share how Emacs integrates or controls your window manager.
 Thank you.

 Notable changes include:
  
support for ChordPro&#x27;s a2crd, which converts tabs copied from websites like Ultimate Guitar into proper ChordPro format.
 improved automatic chord formatting while editing
 improved README :)

I wonder if there is a way to create a child frame that consists only of the tab-bar mode? Thanks for any help!
 I&#x27;ve already tried setting window-safe-min-height and window-min-height to 0, but it didn&#x27;t work.

 Is it always the same as the code written in traditional language such as Java? 
 I personally find it impossible to solve some classic algorithm questions in Haskell and achieve the same time complexity.

 ​
 Is there any way to publish a .org file to HTML but showing the record of time invested in an activity?
 Today I use .org files for tracktime in my projects. And I publish them in HTML for my clients to access. But in some cases the &quot;Clock table&quot; is not enough because it summarizes everything and I cannot highlight the time invested in specific tasks by highlighting the days I worked.
 To get around this I am using two sections of &quot;Clock Tables&quot;, one summarizing everything and in the second section several &quot;clock tables&quot;, one per day (as shown in the print). But this format has proven confusing for some of my clients.
 I would like the daily log to appear in the HTML, the simple format of :logbook: would be interesting, but whenever I export it it is hidden.
 Thank you very much in advance.

                              <span>We have previously introduced FawltyDeps,
a tool to help Python projects avoid the dreaded, and seemingly unavoidable
state, where dependencies declared in the configuration do not match those
actually imported in the code1. FawltyDeps is the perfect addition to your CI,
your pre-commit hooks, or your dependency management arsenal.
Curious to know how FawltyDeps works its magic? In this sequel we’ll delve into an essential component of FawltyDeps: how it matches imports and dependencies behind the scenes, and why it is important to get this matching right.
We’ve been busy working on an improved mapping strategy that combines versatility with simplicity, and we have come a long way from the quite limited version we presented in our first announcement. By the end of this post, you’ll have a …</span>

 I rebind my left win key -&gt; ctrl in linux with the following in .Xmodmap:
  remove mod4 &#x3D; Super_L add control &#x3D; Super_L 
 This works fine in all apps except for emacs since emacs-29, which seems to register control and super at the same time instead of just control. So hitting C-n will result in:
 C-s-n is undefined
 This happens with no init file, and I also checked on master. Anyone know what the deal is or have a suggested workaround?

                              <span>I would like to turn off the Eldoc feature when using Eglot (I find it irritating when Eldoc constantly enlarges the minibuffer) so I did this;
 (setq eglot-ignored-server-capabilities &#x27;(:inlayHintProvider :hoverProvider)) 
 But this also turned off symbol highlighting, which I really like. How do I turn off Eldoc in Eglot without disabling symbol highlighting?

                              <span>This question is pretty niche. ;)
 I use lsp-mode with eldoc support enabled. When I move my cursor over something, a one line description of the signature (or whatever) appears in the minibuffer via eldoc. That&#x27;s great.
 However when I jump to definitions via xref or avy, the eldoc message doesn&#x27;t appear. As a workaround I move the cursor forward one character and back to get it to appear. 
 To fix the xref problems I added:
 (eldoc-add-command #&#x27;xref-find-definitions) (eldoc-add-command #&#x27;xref-go-back) 
 Now when I jump to or back via xref, the eldoc message appears right away.
 However I can&#x27;t get it to work for avy-goto-word-1 and friends. I tried adding avy-goto-word-1, avy-goto-char and such to eldoc-message-commands via eldoc-add-command as above, but it didn&#x27;t help.
 How can I get eldoc messages to immediately appear after using avy commands like avy-goto-char, avy-goto-word-1, etc?

                              <span>Hello,
 I discovered I can use desktop-change-dir to load a specific session that previously saved in your project directory by using desktop-save to create a .emacs.desktop in the directory that you choose. 
 I could read that it should work by starting emacs from the directory to load the .emacs.desktop in the directory where you launched emacs, but it doesn&#x27;t work (Desktop-save-mode is set). 
 To have it loaded, I need to always use desktop-change-dir after to have started emacs.
 Also, I tried to add in configuration, but not work too : 
 (setq desktop-path &#x27;(&quot;.&quot;)) 
 Do you know a way to have it working ?

                              <span>This is about Emacs 26 (26.3+1-1ubuntu2). I can enter the edit mode with evil. But I can not go back (to command mode?) with the ESC button.
 I usually use Emacs 29 and sometimes 27 on different Debian machines. They all use the same init.el and this works well. Mostly I do use org-roam and python (with eglot). There I have no problem with the evil mode.
 No I have access to a crunch machine but only with Ubuntu 20 offering my Emacs 26 and admins won&#x27;t update something.
 I have no idea how to go further with diagnose this problem.
 This is a &quot;minimal&quot; init.el to reproduce that problem.

 But now I have encountered a problem I need your advise to figure it out.
 Basically the problem is that I want to create indefinitely many new widgets in a button callback function without losing the reference to it. But the function is asynchronous of course, so I cant do this
 I thought of two possible solutions:
  
Use IORef to have a reference to the object. I do not really like the idea, because my object gets passed along a lot and having an IORef somehow destroys the beauty of it.
 Make a lazy infinit list of the widgets and then just append the next one on button clicked and this way force it to get created (need to keep track of the times clicked of course). I tried something like widgets &lt;- sequen…</span>

 Where I am now:
 I am familiar with the syntax of Haskell, its main typeclasses and the concept of dictionary passing. I can reasonably read Core and sometimes predict whether the compiler is able to do certain optimizations.
 My code uses only very basic features available in pretty much any programming language, I don&#x27;t feel like it really uses the power of Haskell for anything:
 -- From a real-world project data Discount &#x3D; FractionDiscount Rational | AbsoluteDiscount Int newtype Cents &#x3D; Cents Int applyDiscount discount (Cents cents) &#x3D; ... -- From my toy project data Game &#x3D; { gameCharacters :: [Character] } updateGame game &#x3D; game { gameCharacters :: fmap updateCharacter chars } where chars &#x3D; gameCharacters game 
 These are concrete types, not type…</span>

                              <span>Hello, my current Windows laptop is getting old and I was thinking of buying a new M1/M2 Macbook. At my university, I see some students having trouble with installing GHCup on their Macbooks. 
 I&#x27;ve been told that Macbooks can be a bit troublesome when it comes to some aspects of coding in general and that its almost always more convenient in Windows. For those who code in Haskell on Macs; are there actually any problems installing Haskell and if there are, can it be fixed easily?
 The reason I highlighted M1 and M2 is because people with Intel cores do not seem to have any problems with installing GHCup (from what I know).

 https://github.com/aripiprazole/rinha-de-compiler/blob/main/files/combination.json
 But I found a few problems:
 1) I tried Circe, but I keep hitting the inlining limit with the Function term. I tried increasing but it still persists.
 2) I tried uPickle but couldn&#x27;t find a way to parse partially tagged records (program and location are not tagged, the rest of the structs are) 
 How would you solve that problem? Write it manually or there is another workaround?

                              <span>I find myself needing to collapse and expand table columns very often. How might I configure &#x60; or even just TAB to perform the same action as Ctrl-C Tab (e.g. toggle collapse column)?
 Note that the naive define-key org-mode-map will replace the TAB action in other places, not just in tables. So, for instance, the following will break the usage of TAB to toggle headings&#x27; display:  (eval-after-load &#x27;org &#x27;(progn (define-key org-mode-map (kbd &quot;TAB&quot;) &#x27;org-table-toggle-column-width) ) )

                              <span>I use org-journal with a file per month to note key pieces of work as I do them, sometimes with todos that make it to my agenda. At the start of a week or after a break, it can be useful to review these files. 
 This works fine with a 2 level headline view of the current file about 14 days into the month. At the beginning of the month, I need to switch back to the month before as well. Is there any way to give a headline view of the current and previous file, so I can scroll up/down this and go to the corresponding place in the file? Similar to what agenda-view can do with todos with follow-mode, but showing all headlines in a specific small set of org-mode files, ordered by their appearance in those files?

                              <span>Dear Reddit, is there a way to use the function (org-set-property) on special blocks, like a source block? I keep forgetting the correct argument and parameter names, and it would be useful for me to have a similar behaviour as (org-set-property) for this use case.
 My desired behaviour:
  
Set point in or at a source block (special block in general)
 Enter C-c C-x p (this maps to (org-set-property))
 Get a list of properties, select the property, RET
 Get a list of allowed parameters, select the correct one, RET
  
The property is now added to the special block, in this case the source block. 
 The current behaviour:
 In the current implementation of (org-set-property) a property is set to the header under which my source block is placed.
 Kind regards.

                              <span>I&#x27;m familiar with the ease of clock tables. Very wonderful. But does anybody know how to get similar information on exactly the time intervals worked in a nice table given a time range, tags etc,? Preferably with the project or tasks I was working on for that range. I&#x27;ve been learning emacs lisp for the purpose of making this as a function, but if something already exists I would like to try it out or get help making this function. I&#x27;m very new to lisp.

                              <span>A few years ago I worked in a company that was AWS-based and we had some libraries that were basically Scala wrappers around the Java AWS sdk&#x27;s. I remember things like really testing if, for example, I had really written some code that calls on dynamodb to get an item was a bit of a PITA... Any ways to reduce the time to get feedback on whether your code is actually doing what you want it to do when working on the Cloud?
 I&#x27;m planning on using zio-aws (which seems to cover everything I need to use for now: Cognito, Dynamodb, Elastic Beanstalk, maybe Elastic Load Balancer), but I want to test whether I created my tables properly, if I&#x27;m adding and fetching items properly, etc. Is actually deploying the app and running it on the cloud the only way, or is there a way to run it locally and test the service implementations?

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m new to emacs, getting used to it. I am trying to use emacs for my personal note writing, but also I&#x27;d like to use some of those notes as slides for a presentation with org-present. I want to customize how the presentation mode looks. Trying to follow someone else&#x27;s work I figured I could create a function that changes the theme when launching org-present. When writing the notes, I use leuven theme (I selected it in customize-themes, and saved to use it by default). This is nice. Now, when I do org-present, my function is called. It just does:
 (defun my_slides () (load-theme &#x27;some_theme)) 
 And effectively the background and most colors for text change, except for the headings. They are still in leuven theme. If I manually do customize-themes, then pick the theme I want to use, THEN, do org-present, then the headings appear in the theme I picked. So, what&#x27;s the difference between load-theme and customize-themes--&gt;pick one theme? How can I effectively change the theme to enter in org-present?
 Thanks in advance, any help appreciated.
 EDIT: Solved.
 u/Nawrbit&#x27;s hint worked perfectly. In case it&#x27;s useful for anyone now I have this in my init.el
 ;; Function to change default theme to the theme I want in presentation mode (defun start_slide () (unload-theme &#x27;leuven) (load-theme &#x27;material)) ;; Function to revert to my default theme when exiting presentation mode (defun exit_slide () (unload-theme &#x27;material) (load-theme &#x27;leuven)) ;; Call start_slide function when doing org-present (add-hook &#x27;org-present-mode-hook &#x27;start_slide) ;; Call exit_slide function when exiting org-present (add-hook &#x27;org-present-mode-quit-hook &#x27;exit_slide) 
 Thank you all for your suggestions!

                              <span>I&#x27;m running on macOS 13.5.2 (arm64e? -- Apple M2). I installed it using homebrew 4.1.12 like this:
 brew install d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus@29 --with-ctags --with-debug --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp --with-no-frame-refocus --with-poll --with-xwidgets --with-modern-sexy-v2-icon 
 My first clue that something was wrong was seeing additional Fundamental mode buffers created with names that followed this pattern: *emacs* and *emacs:err*. The *emacs* buffer was trying to run something, but has a configuration issue as indicated by this message in the buffer:
 Lisp expression: Git variable &#x60;github.user&#x27; is unset. Set to: 
 and the *emacs:error* buffer contains no information, but is indicated as related to emacs stderr open in the output of counsel-buffer.
 I believe it has something to do with the async behavior, as I see the following when I examine the process table. Over time the number of extra processes continues to grow.
 ❯ ps auxwww | grep -i emacs | grep -v grep iain 15092 0.1 1.9 411753376 158400 ?? S 1:50PM 0:04.82 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus@30/30.0.50/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs iain 15378 0.0 0.2 408916720 12736 ??

 What&#x27;s the best way to figure the cause of this out?

 I have these lines in my .zshrc, but it doesn&#x27;t help.

 I use Emacs on FreeBSD.
 Has anybody any suggestion?

                              <span>I use Syncthing to keep my files organized between my devices, and wrote this Elisp code to quickly see the sync status of my folders and devices without having to navigate to the Syncthing GUI. This code uses the Syncthing REST API and the request.el package to display the sync percentage and number/filesize of out of sync items in an Emacs buffer.

 I&#x27;m new to coding in Emacs lisp and not a Syncthing power user by any means, so if there are any improvements or suggestions I&#x27;m happy to hear them!

But does anybody know how to get similar information on exactly the time intervals worked in a nice table given a time range, tags etc,? Preferably with the project or tasks I was working on for that range. I&#x27;ve been learning emacs lisp for the purpose of making this as a function, but if something already exists I would like to try it out or get help making this function. I&#x27;m very new to lisp.

                              <span>In writing a bit of haskell, I&#x27;ve come across this problem more than once. Consider the following example: 
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTSyntax #-} import Data.Kind (Type) data Foo :: Type where Bar1 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer} -&gt; Foo Bar2 :: {f :: String, g :: Integer, h :: Double, l :: Double} -&gt; Foo deriving (Eq) 
 ​
 Bar1 and Bar2 have a common &quot;core&quot; (f and g), but Bar2 extends on it by adding the fields h and l. In the way I see it, it makes functions that deal with Foo a little more of a hassle to write, since the fields f and h wouldn&#x27;t be total for all values of Foo, making me resort to the Either and/or Maybe monads. 
 One way to avoid this would be turning Foo into a typeclass that abstract the common features of Bar1 and Bar2 and turning Bar1 and Bar2 themselves into types.
 The downside would be that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use pattern matching as easily and it would be harder to rely on the compiler to tell me when functions don&#x27;t deal with all the possible values in the domain of Foo. Also, things that I could do to both constructors at once (like deriving an Ord instance for both of them) would be alot more verbose to do. And, if I decided to collect them in some sort of list, I would have to deal with heterogeneously typed lists.
 ​
 Anyway, maybe this is too much of a beginner question, but I&#x27;d like to hear from you possible ideas to solve this.

I&#x27;ve thought about writing a python script that does this and then invoking it through Haskell, but I don&#x27;t like the prospect of losing type safety in the process.

                              <span>Swimming with Ideas
Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread.
Ideas I&#x27;m thinking about:
The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis and Linguistic Relativity. Together, these ideas present the notion that language shapes experience. Maybe I have a warped understanding of this. This is obvious when considering self-talk. The language we use when we talk to ourselves dictates our moods, affect, actions, behaviors, and total experience. This is good news. Changing how we talk to ourselves and the stories we tell ourselves will change our experience—the role of methodeutic language or &#x27;speculative rhetoric&#x27; as it steers cognitive understanding of the world.
I&#x27;m a judgment machine. Comparisons and self-criticism are sneaky and ubiquitous. I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;I&#x27;m a failure.&quot; I&#x27;m talking about &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t I spend more time exercising, in the outdoors, walking, zettelkasting?&quot; and other subtle ways I self-evaluate and am critical of my behavior.
Push above what I think is my &quot;reading level&quot; to achieve mastery by reading more books that present more profound ideas. If I want to understand bigger ideas, I must read books with greater ideas to grasp the deeper concepts essential for remarkable achievements. It&#x27;s not enough to read a lot. To do extraordinary things, I must read books that stretch my mind.

                              <span>Per the title, what is your strategy for decluttering your .emacs.d folder?
 I generally like to follow the XDG Base Directory Spec because I like to separate the code that configures the program (emacs) from any installed packages, language-servers, etc. 
 I have hacked together a solution to force emacs to use .cache/emacs/ where appropriate, but I&#x27;m wondering if that is worth the hassle. It seems like many packages want to default to using user-emacs-directory when they need to add files, which I agree is a sensible default, but I find it a bit cluttered when I want to edit my config.
 Curious what others think / do in their configs

It&#x27;s available at https://codeberg.org/akib/guix-channel-emacs-master, and it&#x27;s updated at every midnight (0:00 UTC time). Now updating Emacs is just a guix pull ; guix upgrade for me (and anyone else). So I just thought to share it so that others can benefit too.
 The channel provides four packages:
  
emacs-master: Nothing special.
 emacs-master-tree-sitter: Tree-Sitter!
 emacs-master-pgtk: PGTK and Tree-Sitter.
 emacs-master-pgtk-xwidgets: PGTK, Xwidgets and Tree-Sitter.

 So I have emacs on my work laptop which unfortunately is windows 10. Thanks to some advice on here I got and compiled the mingw64 version, which is generally working well for me. 
 However when I run git, treesitter (mostly python and yaml, with some md) after a while I get an error about too many open pipes. 
 Also, if I compile it with aot native compilation it segfaults when I open any file under git, fine without native compiler.
 Is this a known issue? Is there a fix I need to do in mingw64?
 Thanks!

                              <span>IBM Plex Mono font uses dotted-zero as default for &quot;0&quot; (zero) character, but the installed font contains the slashed-zero glyph. Is there a way to persuade Emacs (on macOS) to use/activate the slashed-zero instead of dotted-zero?

 The Problem:
 Emacs refuses to autoload the init.el file and apply the config therein.
 My Emacs Init File Contents:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp ;; Load Init (load &quot;/Users/d369/.emacs.d/init.el&quot;)
 ;; Load Theme (load-theme &#x27;eNinja)
 ;; Encoding (set-language-environment &quot;UTF-8&quot;)
 ;; Panel Padding (set-fringe-mode 12)
 ;; Font (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;MesloLGS NF&quot; :height 150) 
 ;; Scroll Bar (scroll-bar-mode -1)

 ;; Require, Set, &amp; Initialize Packages (require &#x27;package)

 ;; Initialize use-package (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The Error:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory ~/.emacs.d/elpa/compat-29.1.4.2/compat-autoloads)
 Additional Info:
 The issue seems to be that there is no &#x27;compat-autoloads&#x27; file to be found in the compat-29.1.4.2 directory, which is the latest version downloaded directly from elpa. I haven&#x27;t been able to locate any information on this.

                              <span>My credit card expired. I had to update new information to Github. While being logged in, I noticed that there are currently 390 persons sponsoring Tarsius, the maintainer of Magit.
 Can we make it 400?
 Just today at work I did few small commits, then later on tweaked message from one commit, added few lines of code to the other. Searches to the log, see diffstats, patch contents and all... simple rebase there, small diff there... push to the upstream, all without sweat. Magit makes work feel like play.

  lsp-request: Failed to spawn &quot;rustfmt&quot; &quot;--edition&quot; &quot;2021&quot; 
 I don&#x27;t know why it calls rustfmt with the &quot;--edition 2021&quot; arguments.
 The command rustic-format in rustic-mode runs just &quot;rustfmt&quot; with no issues.
 I already had rustfmt install via rustup.
 I wanted to switch from rustic-mode to rust-ts-mode but this is forcing me to stay with rustic-mode for now.
 Any suggestions?

 The warnings stem from (package-initialize) in my init.el. 
 I added a message to package--activate-all and those packages generate it. Any way to fix this? I have like 45 of those warnings.
 For instance, below block-nav and ace-window generate the errors. Updating to the latest package version also does not help.

                              <span>Upgrade to 13.5.2 was forced by Xcode 15, unfortunately.
 After that GHC 8.10.7 stopped linking (Xcode brought a new gcc with it, and it seems like you can&#x27;t change it), and after moving to GHC 9.6.2 it works, with some linker warnings.
 But now there are seem to be some changes around entropy access, getting this error:
  user error (cryptonite: random: cannot get any source of entropy on this system) 
 Any suggestions? Thank you!

                              <span>So in these days I came across &quot;Thinking with Types&quot; and the first part blew my mind. In particular, the Curry-Howard isomorphism really caught my interest, but I need help to know if I&#x27;m getting it correctly. What I&#x27;ve understood is that we can prove mathematical theorems through CH, for example to prove that a * 1 &#x3D; a we just need to show that there is an isomorphism (hence, 2 functions that are one the inverse of the other) between (a, ()) and a. This gave me chills, so I wanted to try this way of reasoning with a theorem for natural numbers, but I&#x27;m stuck. In particular, I would like to prove that given two natural numbers m,n the GCD of m,n is the same as the GCD of (m mod n) and n. Again, here there is an equality so I think I would have to show there is an isomorphism between the two things. But I can&#x27;t really imagine how to translate something like that in Haskell, and I&#x27;m not even sure if this is actually possible.
 P.S. As a side note, I also wanted to prove that there is no isomorphism between a set X and its power set, but imagining to prove that something doesn&#x27;t exist with CH is even more complicated for me.

                              <span>My job requires me to use asana, but I miss org. I figure other people must have solved this problem already, so I was wondering if anyone has a functional workflow for this already? I google around quickly but only found these two rather old repos:
 https://github.com/tmurph/todo-sync
 https://github.com/mengwong/org-asana 
 If someone has an uptodate option I&#x27;d love to hear about it! thanks so much.

                              <span>Hello all. I currently use neovim as my IDE and note taking application along with mdbook. I use markdown for notes. Prior to this when I was on windows I used obsidian for that purpose. 
 I really liked the philosophy behind obsidian and bidirectional linking. However, ever since I started using Linux I feel the need of avoiding closed source applications. I&#x27;ve seen people use OrgMode and I believe I really like the extensibility. I also like the TODO/scheduling features of OrgMode and the Android app that syncs with it. For that I use calcurse atm. 
 I want to use Emacs solely for the purpose of using OrgRoam alone. That&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t want to go down another rabbit hole of configuration and tinkering (the previous ones being neovim, sway, kitty and gnome in order of recency). I need vim keybinds, a decent syntax highlighting for orgmode, git version control and a dark low contrast colouscheme. I believe OrgMode can already do what markdown does and probably better, so no worries there. 
 What is the best plan of action for this? Thanks a lot for helping me out and I apologise if this sounds too stuck up/opinionated but I really cannot afford to go down that rabbit hole and I am looking for a (relatively) quick solution (preferably doable within a day). Once again, thanks a lot!

                              <span>I had to erase my eln-cache directories and now Emacs is taking hours (literally, more than 12) to ---what I assume--- bytecompile everything again.
 When I run: journalctl --user -xeu emacs.service I get:

 I&#x27;m on a fairly fast laptop, running Fedora 38 (KDE Plasma).
 Any way I can speed up the whole process? Emacs and my system are mainly unusable now.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I would like to share the tree-sitter major-modes verilog-ts-mode and vhdl-ts-mode for FPGA &amp; ASIC design and verification:
  
https://github.com/gmlarumbe/verilog-ts-mode/
 https://github.com/gmlarumbe/vhdl-ts-mode/
  
For the time being they provide the following features:
  
Syntax highlighting
 Indentation
 imenu
 which-func
 Navigation functions
 Beautify functions
 Basic completion at point
  
They are derived from verilog-mode and vhdl-mode respectively, making the switch simpler by having features like Verilog AUTOs or VHDL beautifying still available.
 Both are available on MELPA and MELPA Stable.
 Looking forward to receiving some feedback!

                              <span>A while ago I got type hints on my variable declarations when using rustic-mode and lsp-mode. Then after an update I had to change lsp-rust-analyzer-server-display-inlay-hints to lsp-inlay-hints-enable and now I don&#x27;t get them any more.
 I still get some inlays, like hints on method chains or labels for function parameters, but not type hints on variable declarations. I can&#x27;t find anything about this when googling it, so, reddit, help please?

                              <span>I set up rust debugging in emacs using dap-mode and gdb and the debugging itsleft is working perfectly, however I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to set the file to debug so it stops asking me every time. In my launch.json I set the debug binary in &quot;program&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have an effect, I have tried with and without variables, using absolute and relative paths and nothing seems to work. So is there an emacs variable or something that I can set in my .dir-locals.el to point to the file so when I start debugging it finds the file automatically?
 ​
 This is how my launch.json looks like:
 { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;gdb&quot;, &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;program&quot;: &quot;PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT/target/debug/BINARY_NAME&quot;, &quot;gdbpath&quot;: &quot;rust-gdb&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: [], &quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT&quot;, &quot;preRun&quot;: [], &quot;postRun&quot;: [], &quot;stopAtEntry&quot;: false, &quot;serverStarted&quot;: &quot;INFO&quot; } 
 The all caps parts are substituting for the actual paths, but some folders include &quot;-&quot;s in them if that makes a difference
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>On my Debian machine, the value of umask in /etc/login.defs is 0022 in octal. I override this in my shell configuration to be 0077. With that if I create a file in a terminal I get the permissions -rw-------. Similarly, for a directory I get drwx------. However, in Emacs I get -rw-r--r-- and drwxr-xr-x respectively. So it seems Emacs does not respect my user umask setting. Does it need to be exported as an ENV variable and made visible to Emacs in some way? TIA.

                              <span>Hello 👋 
 My setup is as follows: I use docker compose to start different containers and one of them contains a Django project. Now I want Emacs lsp to be able to detect the environment inside Docker and give suggestions and completions based on this. How do you proceed with this one?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for several years now. I&#x27;ve recently switched to emacs-lucid from emacs-gtk because it&#x27;s supposed to be a bit more stable and because I don&#x27;t want to use a Gtk app in my Qt-based environment. However, I have a minor but annoying issue with some GUI elements (namely, menus and tooltips) being blurry. They kinda look like they have been shrunk and then stretched again, if it makes any sense. Interestingly, this applies only to 1st level menus, 2nd level menus are always rendered properly.
 Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?
 Screenshot showing the issue: https://imgur.com/a/EDodgK1 You can see that the 1st level menu is blurry while the 2nd level menu is as crisp as potato chips.

                              <span>This package is highly inspired by combobulate. The idea to write a new tree-sitter query highlighter comes up after I have read lets write a tree sitter major mode - mastering emacs, I tried to use combobulate to highlight queries, but it cannot work on those languages beyond its support. And also, it cannot work with hideshow minor mode (though, I encounter the same issue when I develop this package. I will make a pull request to combobulate later.) This package has many small features. Check it on sourcehut!

                              <span>Is there any way to have Vim-like tabs in Emacs. I know Emacs supports Tabs by default now but Projectile does not keep track of tabs while switching the project.
 To give some background, I am a long-time Vim user, but I have always loved Emacs. A few months back I spent a lot of time and switched to Emacs. But after a few weeks switched back to Vim because I did not have time with a heavy workload.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently customizing my dired.
 I&#x27;ve found that all-the-icons is just a bit much (with support from all-the-icons-dired). I wanted consistent folder and file icons, but instead I got thousands, and while sometimes they make sense, other times, they don&#x27;t. I tried using vscode-icons in conjunction with dired-sidebar and they were a bit too big (literally) and plain and non-subtle for me. I like the style of all-the-icons, but I want consistency (directories and files, one icon for each, and that&#x27;s it). How can I make that happen?
 The regular &quot;file&quot; and &quot;folder&quot; icons would be ideal.

 Release notes:
  
Further to the release notes for Stack 2.3.1, the -static suffix has been removed from the statically linked Linux/x86_64 binaries.
 The binaries for Linux/Aarch64 are now statically linked.

Build artefacts are placed in .stack-work/dist/

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently reading the book written by Bird &amp; Wadler and trying to solve some exercises about foldl, foldr, etc.. I ran into a problem 3.5.6 that I don&#x27;t know how to solve. The problem is as follows:
 Given a list xs &#x3D; [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] of numbers, the sequence of successive maxima (ssm xs) is the longest subsequence [x_j_1 , x_j_2 , . . . , x_j_m] such that j_1 &#x3D; 1 and x_j &lt; x_j_k for j &lt; j_k. For example, the sequence of successive maxima of [3, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 10, 7] is [3, 4, 9, 10]. Define ssm in terms of foldl.
 I wonder how to solve this? The authors in this chapter mention many identities with foldl, foldr, map (the three duality theorems about foldl and foldr are mentioned), but I don&#x27;t know how to use it in solving this problem. Any help?

                              <span>Setting alpha-background in default-frame-alist wasn&#x27;t working for me, since I use emacs exclusively on the terminal. I found the only theme that respected the terminal&#x27;s background opacity was the default one, except when using kitty, so I guess you&#x27;re good if you&#x27;re a kitty user.
 On a whim, I opened up the theme.el for the theme I&#x27;m using, and added a value in brackets at the beginning of the rgb value for the background, like setting the alpha value for urxvt&#x27;s background in ~/.Xdefaults. Afterwards I noticed the value in the brackets didn&#x27;t matter, and could actually be left empty, like so:
 &quot;[]#000000&quot;
 Different themes will have different names for the main background. Luckily it was labeled &quot;bg-main&quot; on mine.
 P.S.: You have to edit the system-wide theme.el. Changing the one in ~/.local didn&#x27;t work for me. Also, emacs will use whatever transparency value you have set for your terminal (like I said, the value in the brackets above does not matter). And remember to restart the server for the changes to take place.

                              <span>I have to compile gcc with jit support from source because my work&#x27;s SLES 15 SP4 does not have the package, but having an issue that I can&#x27;t seem to google.
 After successfully compiling gcc w/ jit (didn&#x27;t get any errors that were related to jit), I tried to configure emacs with --native-compilation which failed at the jit section.
 These pass:
 gcc_jit_context_acquire in -lgccjit... yes libgccjit.h usability... yes libgccjit.h presence... yes checking for libgccjit.h... yes 
 Then it fails when it tries to run the test program
 So when I run the libgccjit tutorial example myself, I get
 ld: cannot find crtbeginS.o: No such file or directory ld: cannot find -lgcc: No such file or directory ld: cannot find -lgcc\_s: No such file or directory libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver 
 I have tried to search for these errors and can&#x27;t find anything. I also can find crtbegin in my gcc src, but it&#x27;s not in the built.
 I used the default gcc7 that was already installed on the system, so maybe i need to recompile gcc-13 using gcc-11?
 ​
 The crtbeginS.o is located under install_dir/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/13.2.0 which install_dir/lib is appended to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH... so...

                              <span>I&#x27;m switching to eglot from lsp-mode, and I&#x27;m getting an unexpected indentation in C# code. I have a minimal editorconfig file that just sets indent_size to 2. Things seem fine until I hit a semicolon, at which point the current line and the next line both get indented further than they should. Here&#x27;s a before:
 public static class Stuff { public static T DoAThing(T obj) { Console.WriteLine(obj) } } 
 And here&#x27;s what happens when I hit semicolon: 
 public static class Stuff { public static T DoAThing(T obj) { Console.WriteLine(obj); } } 
 Looking at the help for ;, I see that it&#x27;s bound to c-electric-semi&amp;comma, and if eglot isn&#x27;t running, setting c-syntactic-indentation to nil does what I would expect, but when I turn on eglot, the indentation goes wrong. Am I missing something?

I feel like there are some resources talking about it (Daryl Watakara&#x27;s blog posts for example), but don&#x27;t seem to go into a whole lot of detail. For example, is it better to use tags to implement PARA or subdirectories?

                              <span>I upgraded to the latest Emacs and it finally shows complex types in locals window.
 However, when I&#x27;m stepping through a code that uses a pointer, it shows a pointer value, not the pointed structure.
 This screenshot demonstrates the problem: locals window, ptr shown as hex, copy is pretty printed. Any advice welcome.

                              <span>TL;DR: beOrg &quot;sync&quot;d with a workingfolder folder keeps around items from files that have been &quot;removed&quot;, appears not to actually work from the data in the linked folder. (removed is in quotes because beOrg doesn&#x27;t use filenames but file titles in the UI).
 More info/tests: (this may be a bug report, but hoping for a workaround)
 - Changing the /title/ of an org files results in massive dupes in the agenda. beOrg uses the title and not the filename, and it appears to screw with some local caching.
 - Unlinking the working folder doesn&#x27;t change the data at all, so it&#x27;s clearly operating from a separate cache. (and can&#x27;t sync to remove files since you can&#x27;t sync without a linked dir). So don&#x27;t see a way to delete the old data and then just reparse the liked folder.
 - Can&#x27;t just delete the file in question from beOrgs files (and then readd) since then it wants to remove it from the repo also. Using titles to operate on files is a really bad idea it appears.
 - Syncing doesn&#x27;t seem to sync, it just adds. 
 - Since the issue is with the title and not filename I have no clue how to remove the old refs, since you can&#x27;t delete the old file or anything.
 - I would anticipate similar problems with any reorg/refiling of items across files since it seems a totally non-destructive sync.
 ​
 So, does anyone have any ideas if there is a setting hidden somewhere? The next step would be uninstall/kill cache and see how it goes, but that&#x27;s really no good since I like to be able to (re)organize my data. Just archiving seems like it would make beOrg break.
 Thanks for any tips or help. I&#x27;m so close to having my orgGenda on my phone.

                              <span>I have completely revised the Emacs articles on my website and working towards the Emacs Writing Studio.
 This series of articles explains how authors can use Emacs to research, write and publish articles, books, movie scripts and websites. No software development, only writing.
 It is a work in progress, feedback appreciated. Hope to eventually write a book on the topic - written and published in Emacs of course ;)

                              <span>I am using emacs in Archlinux. I observe that the &quot;XF86AudioLowerVolume&quot; key in emacs -Q is recognized as &quot;C-g,&quot; but in other applications, this key functions normally. I&#x27;m not using any external tools to map keys, so I suspect that Emacs is by default translating the &quot;XF86AudioLowerVolume&quot; key to &quot;C-g&quot;. Is there any config option or compile option to disable this behavior? Any help on how to solve this or debug this would be very helpful. Thank you!

 I have tried other solutions like disabling linum-mode but none of them work. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi! I started using the tempel package and noticed that it uses the .eld file. This is the first time I encountered this type of file and wanted to know what it was so I searched google but couldn&#x27;t find a good explanation. ChatGPT said it&#x27;s a Emacs Lisp Dump (ELD) file, but I didn&#x27;t get any search results on google with that either so I&#x27;m skeptical of ChatGPT&#x27;s explanation.
 I&#x27;d like to know if there are any documentations on this.

                              <span>I have used emacs, mu4e, offlineimap, and smtpmail as my mail client for many years with my work&#x27;s exchange/office365 email system.
 Recently, they made yet another change and now I&#x27;m struggling to authenticate smtpmail to send mail. I can successfully download mail with offlineimap, but not send. 
 I&#x27;ve used M365-imap on github to generate the refresh and access tokens to do oauth2 with the outlook servers. Previously, I could do a basic password to sent SMTP. Now, I need to use oauth2 with SMTP and use the access token generated by a python script in M365-imap. (I just put this token in my .authinfo file as the password for the server and specify oauth2 as the authentication method). Problem is, this access token only works once or twice before I have to regenerate it.
 The M365-imap page gives an example sendmail configuration where the passwordeval option is used to fetch a password from the output of the access token script. I need to do the same kind of thing in my authinfo configuration, but I don&#x27;t see an equivalent option. Is this possible?

 In a previous post, I announced the first draft of a proposal for a community-owned cryptography project, and asked for feedback, of which I received plenty. I&#x27;d like to thank everyone that has given their thoughts so far, and the proposal has been updated in turn to reflect that :)
  
Increased prominence of deliverable items (esp unit tests) in proposal
 Performance benefit section has been added to Problem Statement
 Test vectors for algorithms (esp CAVP / FIPS / NIST) added to Optional Deliverables
  
Today I am happy to announce the final draft of the Botan / Cryptography Community Project Proposal. Barring any changes, I plan to officially submit the proposal to the Haskell Foundation on Monday, and I am now asking for any last feedback, opinions, thoughts, and criticisms that anyone might want to sneak in at the last moment.
  
Project update
 In addition to the proposal itself, we have the following updates to the libraries themselves as well:
  
Good progress has been made on Botan.Low.Cipher, which is now properly complete
 Unit tests for Botan.Low.Cipher
 Unit tests revealed that botan_cipher_output_length is inaccurate / flawed
 Corrected buffer estimate functions have been implemented to replace it
 Implemented offline / one-shot and online / incremental encryption
 Online encryption should be much more performant since you can stream the data instead of having to load it all at once
 Some cipher algorithms (SIV, CCM) are not online-capable, and their unit tests fail for the moment, but that is expected behavior (better organized unit tests will fix this)
  
 You can follow the project devlog on discourse!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to arrange all the typeclass relations in Haskell (just the ones that come with Haskell).
 I&#x27;m doing it on a obsidian canvas and I found a really helpful page with a diagram of relations between typeclasses, but I noticed that some typeclasses are missing. like the Applicative.
 I&#x27;m new to Haskell so I myself am not completely aware of all the typeclasses, I was wondering if there are any resources I could refer to?

                              <span>I just wanted to share that I&#x27;ve finally begun reading &quot;Thinking with Types&quot;.
 Already at page 27 my brain started to hurt, in a similar way that LYAH (all of it now so trivial to me) hurt my brain years back.
 I feel like I&#x27;m once again in the process of upgrading my brain, so to speak.
 Has anyone else here been on this path?

                              <span>I have a GADT defined like this:
  data Flow (d :: FlowDirection) where InFlow :: Money -&gt; Frequency -&gt; DateRange -&gt; Flow &#x27;Positive OutFlow :: Money -&gt; Frequency -&gt; DateRange -&gt; Flow &#x27;Negative deriving Typeable 
 and I&#x27;m trying to construct a quasiquoter for a simple DSL to construct these, for which I need a Data instance (to be able to use liftData).
 The problem I get is basically that &#x27;Positive (or &#x27;Negative) don&#x27;t match each other e.g. in gunfold, so I can neither derive the instance nor work out how to write one by hand.
 Is it possible to define a Data (Flow a) instance (or perhaps there&#x27;s a way around the problem by not using liftData at all)?

Specifically I&#x27;ve been using it to write ansible playbooks which feels like a pretty decent fit. Also a side benefit is that github becomes a free blogging platform of sorts. New to ansible for the most part, so feel free to roast it but thought I&#x27;d share the first two that I&#x27;ve done.

The Literal Example page doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything useful since the literal must be inline. The blank looks fine with &quot;low lines&quot; (code point 0x5F) in the org document, but HTML collapses it down to one character. I can use other Unicode characters that are similar but not considered syntax, but is there an alternative method? Following is an example:
 Please fill in the ___________ with the word &quot;blank.&quot;

                              <span>Anyway to assign a special key(like [Enter]) before consult starts ripgrep in the background?
 I pass parameters to ripgrep and on a huge codebase, it takes several seconds to respond, so I want to get the regex and options right before it gets fired.

                              <span>It used to work just right some time ago, I had Vertico and Consult, and find-file used to open a Vertico style vertical autocomplete. At one point (possibly after adding a lot of packages to my init), I noticed that every time I restart Emacs, it reverts back to ido-mode style autocomplete. I need to turn off ido-mode explicitly every time I start Emacs, to get back to Vertico style.
 I don&#x27;t know when that started happening, so I can&#x27;t pinpoint after which package that is. Init is a bit extensive so I will not post it here. 
 Off the tops of your heads, do you maybe know any familiar package that does this under the hood? I have not enabled ido-mode explicitly anywhere in my init. It must be some package that does it.
 Also, is there a package that can act as a debugger for emacs? So I can track the order of command executions and trace where ido-mode is enabled and in which package? Is there any better way to solve this short of disabling package-by-package?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently using doom emacs as my daily driver, and decided to work on some scala projects I have. However, I noticed that autocompletion is not working as intended. May I ask what&#x27;s the standard/correct approach to setup emacs for Scala development? I added (scala +lsp) in my init.el, no extra configuration, so I wonder if I&#x27;m missing something. I&#x27;d appreciate any further help or suggestions. Thanks :)

 So if that&#x27;s you, maybe you use a moonlander with colemak or something, do you have a placement for the modifier and programming punctuation keys that you like? Or know of a resource where this is worked on?
 A longshot I know, but if anywhere I think this would be the place. Thanks.

Error! Result from decryption:
 Decryption failed
 Decryption failed
  
This makes sense because I haven&#x27;t given it any keys and have never done this email decryption thing. But where do I go, and what keys provide?
 This is email via DeltaChat, for what it&#x27;s worth.

\cc matches any character that belongs to the category c.
  
c might be according to M-x describe-categories RET 6: digit
 So I thought a regexp search like \c6 should match digits. But it doesn&#x27;t.
 [[:digit:]] as explained does work. Together with \sc which has no means to match digits this all confuses me anyhow as I am used to \d but well.
 What is the preferred way to match digits with Emacs regex syntax?

                              <span>Is there a way to force horizontal (row-like) window splits for things like: dired-find-file-other-window, compile-goto-error, magit-show-commit, etc? 
 When I&#x27;m working on my laptop screen, these usually open a vertical split and I&#x27;d much rather them be horizontal.

                              <span>I have two functions that share the same constraints and would like to be able to share the tuple constraint definition. The constraints also share many of the same types that are generated by long type functions. I would like to be able to define some type variables withing the synonym instead of having them be parameters and mucking up the function&#x27;s type signature.
 Currently, I am using something like
 type ABC a b &#x3D; (b ~ TypeFunc a, AnotherConstraint b) 
 but would much prefer
 type ABC a &#x3D; forall b. (b ~ TypeFunc a, AnotherConstraint b) 
 Is there a way to accomplish this or a similar solution?
 so that b does not need to be defined in the external context.

                              <span>Hi,
 I finally decided I want to stop pretending like I know Haskell and actually learn it. I just got done reading A Gentle Introduction to Haskell which I liked a lot. I&#x27;d love more resources like that which are relatively concise but which go deeper and cover more of the language. Is there anything like that? I guess I could read the spec - I actually like reading language specifications, sort of, but I massively prefer something a bit more curated. I also have a project planned to get hands-on experience with the language but I like reading and personally I find that the best way to develop a mental model of a language.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello. I wrote a simple emacs http server that evals the code you send in the post body and then returns with a reader compatible string. This allows me to do things like switch buffers from processes running in other languages. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;;code-server.el ;; uses web-server https://eschulte.github.io/emacs-web-server/index.html (defun r-lowercase-symbols (atom) (cond ((symbolp atom) (intern (downcase (symbol-name atom)))) ((null atom) nil) ((listp atom) (mapcar &#x27;r-lowercase-symbols atom)) (t atom)))
 (ws-start &#x27;(((:POST . &quot;.*&quot;) . (lambda (request) (with-slots (process headers body) request (let ((message (cdr (assoc &quot;message&quot; headers))) (password-header (cdr (assoc :PASSWORD headers))) (password &quot;password123&quot;)) (ws-response-header process 200 &#x27;(&quot;Content-type&quot; . &quot;text/plain&quot;)) (if (and (not (null body)) (equal password-header password)) (let ((result (eval (mapcar &#x27;r-lowercase-symbols (car (read-from-string body)))))) (progn (process-send-string process (format &quot;%s&quot; result)))))))))) 
 9005)
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Here is some common lisp code that I use to switch buffers from an SBCL process
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 (defun elisp (form) (drakma:http-request &quot;http://localhost:9005&quot; :method :post :content-type &quot;text/plain&quot; :additional-headers &#x60;((&quot;password&quot; . ,(car (uiop:read-file-lines &quot;phoenix/emacs-password&quot;)))) :content (format nil &quot;~S&quot; form))) (defun open-in-buffer (filename) (let ((form &#x60;(switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect ,filename nil nil nil)))) (elisp form))) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 ... and the same call with CURL, with filename&#x3D;&quot;~/notes/
  curl -d &quot;(SWITCH-TO-BUFFER (FIND-FILE-NOSELECT \&quot;~/notes/\&quot; nil nil nil))&quot; -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: text/plain&quot; -H &quot;password: password123&quot; http://localhost:9005 
 I&#x27;m using a custom auth header, because basic auth with emacs web server was difficult to get working. Also, it&#x27;s less likely to get hacked.

                              <span>Please forgive this brief bout of introspection.
 I noticed that after a full workday with emacs, I am not exhausted, whilst after a full workday with anything that makes me click or drag or use arrow keys, I am knackered. 
 I look forward to working in emacs. I dread and procrastinate working with other tools, no matter how good otherwise. E.g., Mathematica and IntelliJ products are great, but they wear me out.
 I chalk this up to &quot;mental cache misses:&quot;
 If I can leave my hands on the home row of an ANSI keyboard, everything stays &quot;in-cache&quot; and I get flow-go. If I must reach for a pointing device or arrow keys, I get a &quot;muscle-memory cache miss.&quot; If I must take my eyes off the cursor to go hunting around menus or dialog boxes, I get &quot;visual cache misses.&quot;
 I guess I learned 1-dimensional work habits from reading books. I don&#x27;t do well with video learning. Scanning back and forth in a video to review info is like hunting around for menus and dialog boxes; it wears me out. I do better if I treat a video like an in-person lecture and take linear notes with pen and paper.

                              <span>I love having my org files come up all nice and tidy, but when I try to step into a diff with magit or do some search operation anything hit under a heading is out of sight. The org follow mode (from agenda) knows enough to open it up to show the text, is there a way to generalize this behavior?

 Thanks for any pointers.

They linked a paper comparing the differences between natural deduction, lambda calculus, and sequent calculus. I have been unable to find this paper. Can someone link this, or other good papers/sources about sequent calculus in comparison to lambda calculus? Thanks!

 She just took a 21.2k hit to her savings from medical expenses, leaving her at under 9k. In addition to me loosing my part time job(broken arm) as I’m still a physics undergrad student.
 She has a background in mathematics and algebraic geometry, and is hugely talented; please if anyone can help.

GHC plugin for HLint by Gabriella Gonzalez
At work I was recently experimenting with running hlint (the widely used Haskell linting program) as a GHC plugin. One reason why I was interested in this is because we have a large (6000+ module) Haskell codebase at work, and I wanted to see if this would make it cheaper to ru…</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 First of all, here is my current setup: Emacs installed via snap using Doom Emacs, TexLab (installed via cargo), latex enabled in Doom emacs with +lsp and +latexmk. The LaTeX LSP is working fine, and when I compile a document that needs pdflatex, it works.
 When I compile a document that requires LuaLatex, it asks me if I want to use the LuaTex engine. And when I click yes, it says this: LaTeX: problems after [0] pages and does not compile at all. I am able to compile the document by compiling it in the terminal, so the document is not the problem.
 Any ideas on how to get this working? I am not able to use XeLatex either. The distro I am using is Pop!_OS 22.04. 
 EDIT: More details! I press M-x and run LaTex-command-selection. When I select LaTex option from the menu, I get asked if I want to use LuaTex, and when I press y I get the issue. The same thing when I select the LatexMk option. I have a .latexmkrc file in the project directory as well with the contents: $pdflatex &#x3D; &#x27;lualatex&#x27;;
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>I think Emacs 29.1 shipped with Org v9.6.6, while the latest version of org-mode is 9.6.9. What&#x27;s the roadmap for integrating the newer versions in Emacs (or where can I find discussions of this)?
 I ask because I&#x27;d like to stick with the built-in version rather than have multiple versions simultaneously, and I&#x27;m looking forward to some of the updates.

 It took me a while to find enough information on the relatively-new Android port of Emacs, so I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d gather everything I found together here to help others out.
 First of all, the version of Emacs available on f-droid is out of date. Uninstall it. Also, and this may be inconvenient for lots of people, if you have and are using Termux, you should uninstall that too. That&#x27;s because the optimal way to use the GUI-based, Android-native version of Emacs is in tandem with a custom fork of Termux which shares a developer ID with Emacs so that they can cooperate. If you don&#x27;t know, Termux is a command-line GNU/Linux shell and environment for Android with a package manager. With the custom version, you can use the Termux package manager to install GNU/Linux app…</span>

                              <span>I have been one of the people who have never gotten used to the terminal inside emacs. I think the main reason is how the history works. 
 Is there a way to make the history work like a regular terminal, rather than jumping back in the buffer to its position?
 I wrote a three part method to switch, using bash in a terminal (it should be OS agnostic), to the directory of the active window:
 First, emacs:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (defun dmg-current-dir () (if buffer-file-name (file-name-directory buffer-file-name) (expand-file-name default-directory))) #+end_src 
 then create a script, I call it edir , put it in your path
  #!/bin/bash emacsclient -e &quot;(progn (set-buffer (window-buffer (selected-window))) (dmg-current-dir))&quot; | perl -pe &#x27;s/^&quot;(.+)&quot;/$1/&#x27; 
 Finally create a function in your .bashrc
  function cde { A&#x3D;&#x60;edir&#x60; cd &quot;$A&quot; } 
 Source your .bashrc. now you can simply run cde to change to the current directory (and use edir for other commands)
 I am sure it can be done in two steps (emacs + function) but my bash skills are limited.

                              <span>I see big projects like yasnippets deprecating (Clojure term) namespacing/(emacs term) prefixing with a slash for namespacing with a dash. For example, yas-recompile-all is now replacing yas/recompile-all. I see such conventions followed for other libraries, too. Personally, no doubt because I&#x27;m a Clojure programmer, I like the slash over the dash. It is more distinctive, knowing &quot;this isn&#x27;t just a core function with that name, but an actual NS (ish).&quot; I guess it might be more honest to elisp not to indicate there is a true namespace and it&#x27;s all just a naming convention, but is this really the reason? Or is it something about compatibility (maybe with terminal users? Do terminals dislike the /?), or about interop (maybe libraries like yasnippet are also being ported to other things, like VIM or VSCode, that might have an opinion?) Does anyone know why dashes are preferred to slashes?

                              <span>Just that. I&#x27;ve been working with emacs since 2018 but I never managed to get lsp working. I used it mainly for org, magit and quick text manipulation. 
 But as a damn stubborn clumsy guy I am, in my n-th try it just worked. Now I want to get dap mode working and some tweaks that would be nice for me to have, but that&#x27;s another story. 
 Huge shoutout, thanks and props to all the emacs community. There are lurkers out there that don&#x27;t say anything (like myself until today) but that are eternally grateful for your tirelessly effort.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a package that lets you send marked text to your kindle email address? I tried to copy/paste some text from a buffer into mu4e and send it to my kindle email address and forgot that it has to be in attachment form. So I&#x27;m just thinking if there&#x27;s a way to do export it automatically as an attachment somehow and attach it to an mu4e compose buffer automatically with your kindle address.
 That could be really nice to read very long screens of text.
 I couldn&#x27;t find one with a search but maybe it still exists?
 EDIT: After talking to some people in #systemcrafters and the like, here&#x27;s the ideal:
 1) Mark text in a buffer
 2) Hit M-x 
 3) It exports text to like /tmp/ as a .pdf or .epub or something
 4) then it opens mu4e and attaches as an attachment
 5) it fills out the email for [name@kindle.com](mailto:name@kindle.com)
 And then all you have to do is hit C-c C-c to send.
 I see this as really useful for reading very long text buffers in a more convenient way than on a laptop or monitor screen for a long time.

 In my free time I&#x27;ve created a small functionality for reading/browsing phone contancts and making phone calls from within Emacs on Termux, Android. It&#x27;s been working well on my device. It is based on a python libary for making termux calls.
 Anyone interested in giving it a shot and sharing your thoughts? 🧙‍♂️📱

 i was just wondering if it was possible to disable buffer groups while using the centaur-tabs plugin, i really just don&#x27;t understand the behavior of not seeing everything that is open in the tabs. is this a behavior that can be disabled or is this just something i&#x27;ll have to get used to?

                              <span>I have basically two questions:
  
What other software uses a similar kind of architecture to Emacs? A small core with an interpreter and everything else being (openly) built around that? Are there projects based on this idea that you know of that never came to fruition? 
 
How would one go about implementing a similar kind of application?
 
 And just in advance, I already know about Lisp machines and how they relate to Emacs.

                              <span>Sorry, I&#x27;m sure this is a stupid and obvious question for most of you, but I don&#x27;t find the answer. I have two panes in the emacs screen, one with the notes I&#x27;m taking and the other one with the pdf (in docview) that I am reading and taking notes from. I know that I could swicht buffers within one of the panes with C x right/left, but I don&#x27;t want that. I want to switch the cursor, if that makes sense. A shortcut to switch from one pane to the other, not buffers. Is that possible?

                              <span>Hi, this is my first post here. I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell on-and-off for about a year now. I&#x27;ve completed two or three beginner-level books, but I still find it challenging to write full-fledged Haskell apps. Simultaneously, I&#x27;ve been dabbling a bit with Rust.
 My dilemma is that I lack sufficient experience and a deep understanding of the philosophies of these two languages to make an informed choice on where to invest my time. I&#x27;ve tried both, but I feel that I won&#x27;t be able to make an effective comparison without creating a larger project in each (for which currently I have no time unfortunately).
 I&#x27;m love Haskell&#x27;s purity, abstractions, and expressiveness and at the same time I find memory management in Rust to be a bit of a pain. However I&#x27;ve noticed many people transitioning from Haskell to Rust, and that Rust ecosystem is much more lively and it&#x27;s causing me to wonder if Haskell is slowly falling out of favor.
 The response I&#x27;ve seen several times is that Haskell is worth it for it&#x27;s educational aspect, but I&#x27;m interested in more practical side of things. Is there anybody who thinks that Haskell is better then Rust for real world applications?
 From my current perspective, Rust doesn&#x27;t seem like a direct replacement for Haskell. I&#x27;m not sure how to incorporate the functional style I love into Rust. Could this just be a lack of expertise on my part? Would I eventually be able to write Rust in a way that captures what I like about Haskell?
 I&#x27;m aware this topic has been discussed many times in various forums, but I still can&#x27;t shake the feeling that focusing on Haskell might not be a worthwhile investment. Would it be more reasonable to spend time gaining a deeper understanding of Rust?
 Any insights from those with broader experience in both languages would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I’m new at programming and I’m trying to implement a function that takes two lists as input and return a list of tuples
 myFunction [3,1,7,2] [“a”, “b”, “c”, “d”] &#x3D; [(3,”a”), (1,”b”), (7,”c”), (2,”d”)]
 I did it like this 
 myFunction:: [Int] -&gt; [Char] -&gt; [(Int, Char)] myFunction (x:xs) [] &#x3D; error “one of the list is empty”
 myFunction [] (d:ds) &#x3D; error “one of the list is empty”
 myFunction (x:xs) (d:ds) &#x3D; (x, d) : myFunction xs ds 
 When I try to run it, it gives me “non-exhaustive patterns in function” which I assume means that I haven’t defined enough base cases for my function… Appreciate the help!

                              <span>I have a directory with all the writing that I&#x27;ve done over the past year, and want to batch-add org-id&#x27;s to all of the files so that they can be inserted into my org-roam system.
 Is there any way to do this?
