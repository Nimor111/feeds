                    <span>I&#x27;m in the early stages of working on a python application that will provide quantitative stats about my zettelkasting habit. It wants to show progress and a measure of rather I&#x27;m easing up or baring down. I also want it to show me what&#x27;s new so I can review and refactor as needed. I call this my ZK Dashboard.
This says nothing about the quality of my zettelkasting. It says nothing about rather or not I am following best practices. This says nothing about its value to my future self. It does help guide me in tracking my activity, my time sitting in the chair zettelkasting, and this is 73.4% of success. Just showing up regularly is the most critical step.

                    <span>Sometimes I miss the simple 10p and similar 15d kinds of command combos of vim in emacs. Is there any emacsy command for those or is the recommended way is simply to use vile mode for such situations? (I think there is something grammatically wrong with the double &#x27;is&#x27; in the previous sentence, but I don&#x27;t know the correct way). I do use doom emacs on my chromebook (so no issues with this there) but on my other systems, I simply use vanilla emacs.

                    <span>I haven&#x27;t seen this error reported anywhere so I thought I&#x27;d check if anyone else is seeing it. I have all my packages installed via straight.el and use-package, and after a pull of all packages, org-agenda fails to load with:
 org-agenda-skip: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-in-archived-heading-p
 I tried clearing my straight cache and pulling a few more times, nothing seems to fix it. Looking at the elisp for org, the function org-in-archived-heading-p seems like its defined in org.el, so I&#x27;m confused as to why the symbol isn&#x27;t being found.
 Has anyone else seen something like this?

 a silly example could be a missing return at the end of the line

                    <span>Windows decided to restart while I was asleep last night, so of course I didn&#x27;t have a chance to save and close Emacs.
 However, when I went to &#x27;recover session&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible to get back to where I was.
  
the relevant .saves-[etc]~ file seems to only list unsaved files, so apparently if there were things I had had open but had saved they don&#x27;t appear. Non-file buffers also don&#x27;t seem to be listed.
 when i attempt to recover the session, it asks if I want to recover one of the six files listed, then seems to quit. Even when I press ! which the help tells me will &#x27;recover all remaining files&#x27;, it only reopens the one.
  
​
 I&#x27;m starting to accept the idea that I won&#x27;t be able to get back to where I was last night, but is there a way to set up emacs so that it saves all aspects of a session, so that next time I can actually recover and get back all my frames, windows, tabs, and buffers after a forced (or even voluntary...) shutdown, not just a single unsaved file?
 And (Or?) how do I get it to at least recover the other files M-x recover session knows about but doesn&#x27;t seem to be reaching?

 What do you guys recommend?

                    <span>I only use non-Emacs software for two things. Web browsing and calendars. In my effort to never exit Emacs (I spend way too much perfecting it to spend time on other apps), I want to tackle calendars next.
 I currently use Google&#x27;s calendar. I have been looking for ways to use Emacs&#x27; calendar but I couldn&#x27;t find solutions that check all my boxes:
  
Ability to subscribe to multiple calenders (via ics urls).
 Ability to have multiple calenders (like in Google, for example, I have one for work and one for personal events).
 Ability to create, delete and edit events.
 Ability to sync calendars with Google calendars (and Microsoft calendars if possible), so I can check events on my phone.
  
I imagine that these requirements are shared by others, so there must be a way to satisfy all of them. I just couldn&#x27;t find it.
 Does anyone have a working setup for calendars that they can share?
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hi.
 It starts with loading plugins. I use a dashboard where it shows how long plugins take to load. On previous macOS is always was ~1.3 seconds. Now it&#x27;s ~3 seconds. Basically all operations take much longer. Magit is close to unusable.
 Is anyone also experiencing this?

Is anyone else having this issue?
 Edit: This seems to only be occurring on Windows. I just tried it on Debian and there&#x27;s no issue. I&#x27;ve read that this has something to do with a Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate expiration, but have not found an immediate fix.
 Trying gpg --homedir ~/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg --receive-keys 066DAFCB81E42C40 as one answer from SO suggested does not work.

                    <span>I have a task that I&#x27;ve done using some Emacs and some command line tools (sort and cut), but it&#x27;s slow and error prone and I reckon I could do it all in Emacs, but I don&#x27;t quite know how.
 ​
 Please help me learn how to write some elisp to solve this...
 ​
 My problem:
  
I want to sort lines in a file based on a date string in the line itself.
 For simplicity: 
 There are two types of lines, but the structure is consistent within a type.
 type A might be: INSERT INTO tableA VALUES (something, something, &#x27;2021-11-11 11:11:11.111+00&#x27;, something);
 type B might be: INSERT INTO tableB VALUES (something, &#x27;1999-12-31 01:01:01.001+00&#x27;, something, &#x27;2021-11-11 22:22:22.222+00&#x27;, something, something);
 I want the second date string in type B
 
 So based on seeing uniqueA or uniqueB in the string I know where(ish) the date string is
 Naturally, each line has different data for the something values and different date-time strings.
 There is a chance that the &quot;line&quot; may actually be broken with new-lines in the text, so what I know is that it starts with INSERT INTO and ends with );\n
  
​
 What I&#x27;ve done
  
Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableA, then isearch-regex-forward for ..-..- to get my date string, copy that string, move to the start of the line, paste with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I have done all the lines
 Emacs: Define keyboard macro to search for tableB, then blah-blah-blah paste date at start of line with a following space. C-u to apply lots of times, iterate until I&#x27;ve done all the lines
 Jump back to my shell. sort the file, cut -f3- -d&#x27; &#x27; the file and then I have my sorted file.
  
(I tried working out how to do the Emacs part in sed, but failed to see a useful example online...)
 ​
 This approach is complicated and error prone and not very reproducible.
 How would you go about it in Emacs?

                    <span>Hi there, 
 lately I&#x27;m learning Haskell and now I&#x27;m stuck at polymorphism. Are there any good recourses out there where I can read about that?
 I would need polymorphism for functions and datatypes.

                    <span>MotoRefi is hiring for a DevOps engineer. However, we are also really interested in finding someone with experience in Haskell and related tooling as well as Kubernetes to support the Insurance team. This role could be 25% Haskell with a focus on developer experience and tooling and 75% DevOps. 
 ​
 We have a JD here: https://boards.greenhouse.io/motorefi/jobs/4741981003
 We are also seeking Senior Software Engineers here: https://boards.greenhouse.io/motorefi/jobs/4741865003
 ​
 For both of those positions if you do get in contact with recruiting make sure to reference the Insurance team (that&#x27;s the team that uses Haskell). These positions can be remote, or in the DC, Austin, or Denver offices.

                    <span>Hello,
 does anyone know of an open source project/web app/library, written in Haskell, that makes terminal interface accessible via browser?
 An example of what I&#x27;d like to achieve:
 Start R repl process withing a docker container on the backend (e.g. &#x60;docker run -it --rm rocker/r-base&#x60;) and allow user to interact with it using terminal-like interface from their browser (with stuff like TAB completion working etc.)
 It seems that xterm.js is a popular choice to implement the client side of such a thing,
 but I&#x27;m looking for some inspiration of how a backend of such an application could be implemented in Haskell.
 Examples in other languages that do similar thing to what I&#x27;d like:
 Go: https://github.com/yudai/gotty
 Typescript: https://github.com/butlerx/wetty

                    <span>TLDR; When publishing your library to Hackage, how do you figure out optimal lower and upper bounds for dependencies so that others can easily use it but that you are still sure your library will work correctly? 
 I wrote a strong-path package, which I published on Hackage. I am using Stack to build it: I have stack.yaml and package.yaml as sources of truth, while strong-path.cabal is generated by Stack but I also commit it into vcs.
 When I started developing strong-path, I haven&#x27;t specified any dependency versions in package.yaml, since I knew it will pull whatever is provided by the Stack resolver I am using, and that worked fine for me.
 At some point I started needing the newer version of &#x60;path&#x60; package than the version that was present in the LTS resolver, so I added &#x60;path-0.9.0&#x60; und…</span>

                    <span>Please help me make a positional voting system kind of like the Eurovision, in which each country votes for their 3 favourites. The first favourite gets 3 points, second gets 2 and third favourite gets 1 point.
 votes :: [(String,(String,String,String))] votes &#x3D; [ (&quot;Belgium&quot;, (&quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;France&quot;)), (&quot;Denmark&quot;, (&quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Belgium&quot;)), (&quot;Spain&quot;, (&quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Greece&quot;)), (&quot;France&quot;, (&quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;)), (&quot;Greece&quot;, (&quot;Portugal&quot;, &quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;France&quot;)), (&quot;Iceland&quot;, (&quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;Denmark&quot;, &quot;Portugal&quot;)), (&quot;Portugal&quot;, (&quot;Iceland&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Spain&quot;))] 
 to count each country&#x27;s points i&#x27;m trying to implement votesCandidate, where you give a name of a country and get back how many points they got
 votesCandidate :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -&gt; String -&gt; Int 
 and finally electionWinner, that knowing what each country voted and how many points each got, will tell you the winner
 electionWinner :: [(String,(String,String,String))] -&gt; String 
 for example:
  &gt; votesCandidate votes &quot;Portugal&quot; 12 &gt; votesCandidate votes &quot;Greece&quot; 1 &gt; electionWinner votes &quot;Portugal&quot;

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been doing some type-programming lately, and realized the stuff I&#x27;m writing is significantly different than the world as it existed in 2018. We now have quantified constraints, HKDs, kind-generics, and all sorts of other cool techniques. 
 Since 2018, there have also been lots of other books! I haven&#x27;t been great at keeping up --- but has anything superseded TwT? If so, there&#x27;s probably not much reason in pushing out a new edition.
 But if there&#x27;s sufficient interest, I&#x27;d be more than keen to put it together. Let me know!
 Cheers, Sandy

 Any ideas what variable or settings may have caused this behavior? It was working as designed a couple of weeks ago. I recently got doom package running, but no change when I comment that out in the config.

                    <span>Hey everyone,I&#x27;m trying to create a &quot;visit_count_file&quot; property for each org file I have. The code I&#x27;m doing should:
  
create the property value equal to 1 if it&#x27;s not here yet
 increments the property value each time you open the file
  
Here is what I came up with for now
 (defun lkr/increment-visit-count () &quot;increments the &#x27;file_visit_count&#x27; property +&#x3D;1&quot; (interactive) (org-entry-put 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot; (number-to-string (+ (string-to-number (org-entry-get 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot;)) 1)))) (defun lkr/update-visit-count () &quot;creates or increments the &#x27;file_visit_count&#x27; property&quot; (if (org-entry-get 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot;) (lkr/increment-visit-count) (org-entry-put 0 &quot;file_visit_count&quot; &quot;1&quot;))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;lkr/visit-count-update) 
 the problem is that it creates the property value in the first heading of the file if the heading is in the first line, and create the property at the top of the file otherwise. How can I do to always put the property at the top of the file?
 behavior:
 ​
 * first heading :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: 
 wanted behavior:
 :PROPERTIES: :file_visit_count: 1 :END: * first heading 
 I just started to fiddle with org mode and emacs lisp so I&#x27;m not very good at it. Thanks for reading.
 Bonus question:would it be easy to do the same but instead of putting it in a property drawer, putting it in
 #+visit_count_file: 1 * first heading 
 like this? what would be better in your opinion?Thank you again.

                    <span>I keep all my Org files in a Git repo, so the archiweirdval feature feels a bit redundant -- though I keep using it, because C-c $ / $ (in the agenda) is so convenient.
 There&#x27;s tons of .org_archive files littered around my repo, and if I complete two different tasks on different machines, I get merge conflicts in the archive files. I think I&#x27;d rather just have it delete the entries and use Git in the unlikely even that I need to dig through the archives -- I think it&#x27;s happened maybe two or three times in the 12 years (yikes!) I&#x27;ve been using Org Mode.
 I guess the only thing I&#x27;d be missing is explicitly recording TODO completion. If I just delete the TODO, it could have been done and closed, or unnecessary and not done. I&#x27;m definitely not going to change state, commit, delete, commit -- I think I can live with that loss for a cleaner repo.
 Is there a thing that makes archival work better with Git repos? What are y&#x27;all doing for this?

                    <span>Howdy. I&#x27;m brand new to Scala and I&#x27;m aiming to do 2021 Advent of Code in Scala. Does anyone have advice or resources for me?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I am running AdoptOpenJDK jdk-16.0.1.9-hotspot and sbt 1.5.5
 I get an error when I try to run my projects in my Command Prompt.
 For example I created a very simple sbt-based Scala project (using IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.3). The code is simple, I want to add 1 to x:
 package plusOner object Fish { def plusOne(x: Int): Int &#x3D; x + 1 } 
 Then I want to try the plusOne method in the SBT console by opening my project folder in the command prompt. The only thing I do in the command prompt is the following:
  
Change directory to the sbt folder
 Type sbt
 Type console
  
But as I type in console, I get an error (partial error message, click here for the full error message):
 [error] java.nio.file.InvalidPathException: Illegal char  at index 0: &quot;C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-16.0.1.9-hotspot\bin 
 How do I fix this error?
 My environment variables (User Variables and System Variables) can be seen here.

                    <span>After being convinced of the usefulness of code formatters by the excellent scalafmt, which is very widely used in the Scala ecosystem, I was on the lookout for a similar tool for Haskell. In 2018, most options did not completely cut it for me, due to e.g. only formatting certain parts of the source file or having many unfortunate bugs. Upon discovering Ormolu in 2019, I was first appalled by its style, but this reaction was only short-lived, as I found these stylistic preferences to be easily malleable via familiarisation.
I started using Ormolu for all personal projects, and submitted bug reports and minor pull requests. Therefore, an internship to work on Ormolu full-time came like a call!

                    <span>Hi,
 This is some part of my .emacs config file. When I start Emacs and input M-x sly or M-x slime, I usually would get an editor and a REPL. In the editor, I should have lispy-mode on automatically (if according to the config), however, I still need to M-x lispy-mode to get it to work. So I was wondering that where I did it wrong?
 ;; Emacs Lisp (add-hook &#x27;emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (lispy-mode 1) (show-paren-mode 1))) ;; Common Lisp (add-hook &#x27;lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (lispy-mode 1) (show-paren-mode 1)))

                    <span>Rather than having a control or special key based command for changing window sizes, or having to remember and use a lengthy Emacs function name (enlarge-window-horizontally) for example, I&#x27;d like to set up an evil statusline command like so
 (evil-ex-define-cmd &quot;ewh&quot; &#x27;enlarge-window-horizontally) 
 so I can use :ewh instead. (There are also other ways to get the same effect, but I&#x27;m using this for now.)
 This works (which is good), but it only grows the window by one character width, so I&#x27;d like to be able to use &quot;.&quot; to repeat it. However, this command does not appear in the ring for some reason, so whatever was used before :ewh is what ends up repeated.
 How can I use this alias/command I want while also having calls appear in the ring so they are eligible for repetition by &quot;.&quot;?
 Unfortunately, prefacing the command with a number like :5ewh does enlarge the window by five characters, but it also moves me to line 5. This approach would also be okay if it didn&#x27;t navigate to a new line.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using emms with mpd, and for the most part it has been working wonderfully for me. The only things that I have not been able to get working are:
 (emms-random) ; this plays only one track randomly. The next song is the next on the playlist.
 (emms-toggle-random-playlist) ; same problem, songs continue to play in playlist order
 ​
 these two also don&#x27;t work:
 (emms-toggle-repeat-track)
 (emms-toggle-repeat-playlist)
 ​
 I&#x27;m on Emacs 27.2 and emms 20211019.2004.
 Any suggestions will be appreciated.

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m a emacs user from 1 year but Im not so professional.
 I&#x27;m using emacs 27 in Fedora. I make my own dotfiles. Im using everything with Emacs including music player, and I use emacs as IDE for some programming languages. My question is that, I use lsp-java but I guess it is effective with just springboot projects. But Im using various frameworks. How can I configure my Emacs as Java IDE as well. And debugging part is important for me. I&#x27;m dealing problems for configuring spring debugger. I also listen your ideas.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to color text after a given keyword. eg: void main()
 void is already colored, because my lisp file detects the keyword. But I don&#x27;t know how to color the next one. Ideally it shouldn&#x27;t color the parenthesis. How would I solve this problem? Thanks!

                    <span>or Is there any way to use lsp-mode with json support for emacs in completion. I heard , the vscode performance better is because of json in completion. so, is there any way or without compiling ?

                    <span>Not sure if this is a bug, or really where to go to start debugging.
 I&#x27;m on a mac, and testing this on a prebuilt Emacs 26 from homebrew, and emacs 28.0.60 I compiled. It seems that in my v28.0.60 if I open a tramp connection to a remote server that is behind a VPN, if the VPN connection is killed, emacs completely freezes. (to test, I just open a dired remote directory, and sever the connection. Instant beachballing.) I&#x27;ve tried setting tramp verbose mode to 10 and sending SIGUSR2, but am having trouble getting useful information (for me). Once the freezing happens, I can&#x27;t recover and its becoming extremely frustrating. SIGUSR2 can at least let me get back into emacs, but in a debug mode. The only message I could see was about a premature ending and Forbiddent reentrant tramp. (I don&#x27;t have the exact messages right now, but could get them.)
 I do have a copy of my v26 emacs, and it does not have the same problem. When the VPN/remote connection is killed, emacs locks up for a few seconds, before it simply times out, and I can keep going. Annoying, but not a show-stopper.
 In each case, I am starting with emacs -Q option and the only extra command I&#x27;m using before opening files is ido-mode.
 I did stumble on  this issue  which mentions that start-file-process-shell-command was changed between v26 and v28. Is what I am noticing something related to that?
 The behavior is very different between versions on the same computer (and ssh configuration), and I am loading things with the &quot;-Q&quot; option for no init file. Any pointers to how to track this down would be helpful. Did I compile without some magic flag in the configuration that was needed?

                    <span>I&#x27;m starting to have trouble with the performance in certain scenarios, even some things like typing text or text navigation (via up/down keys) is sluggish. 
 I suspect this is a bad third-party library, but short of manually disabling modes I don&#x27;t know of a good way to monitor the performance. Can anybody suggest workflows which help them identify slow logic?

 if let p &#x3D; a {foo} else {bar}, where p is an arbitrary pattern, bar is an expression, and foo is an expression potentially involving components of p.
 So far, I have 2 good (that is, not overly verbose) ways to do it, both of which require an extension:
 (\case p -&gt; foo; _ -&gt; bar) a (uses LambdaCase)
 fromMaybe bar [foo| p &lt;- a] (uses MonadComprehensions)

                    <span>Vital Biosciences is a company based in Toronto (Canada) building a medical device aiming to revolutionize medical diagnostics. Because of the size of our stack we use a variety of languages, to choose the most appropriate tech at each level of the stack. We use Haskell, SQL, and Rust, with a splash of C and Python where it makes sense.
 Quick Facts:
  
This is a remote position. If you prefer an office environment and live in or are willing to relocate to Toronto that works for us.
 We are looking for a mid/senior level hire. We love to hire junior candidates with great promise, but at this point the team isn&#x27;t yet large enough to share the training effort.
 The working hours for this position are in Toronto local time (ET)
 Authorized to work in US/CA is a slam dunk. Other countries are possible but we may need to do some investigation before we promise we can make it happen.

 I&#x27;m a haskell developer here and I was asked to share this posting. One of my favorite parts of the job is working alongside a science team and a hardware team to make a thing I can touch. It&#x27;s a refreshing change of pace from working at companies that just produce a cloud service. I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability!

                    <span>I am obviously doing something wrong.
 I see in the wikibook it says 
 foldMap (g . f) &#x3D; g . foldMap f 
 so i tried g &#x3D; (+1) and f &#x3D; Sum 
 i get 
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; foldMap ( (+1) . Sum ) [1..10] Sum {getSum &#x3D; 65} 
 which is what i expected. 
 But when i try 
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; (+1) . foldMap Sum [1..10] :16:8: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘a -&gt; c’ with actual type ‘Sum a0’ • Possible cause: ‘foldMap’ is applied to too many arguments In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘foldMap Sum [1 .. 10]’ In the expression: (+ 1) . foldMap Sum [1 .. 10] In an equation for ‘it’: it &#x3D; (+ 1) . foldMap Sum [1 .. 10] • Relevant bindings include it :: a -&gt; c (bound at :16:1) 
 I tried bracketing as 
 Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; ((+1) . foldMap Sum) [1..10] Sum {getSum &#x3D; 56} Prelude Control.Monad Data.Monoid&gt; 
 but this is not the same as 65 which i would expect.

                    <span>I hit up the discord first, since I&#x27;m not sure the slot this will take up in the subreedit front page is worth it but:
  
What&#x27;s the best way to do Vue-style components and applications, but using Purescript instead of Typescript?
 I&#x27;m using Jest + Stryker to do (property-based, mutation) testing. Should I use them with Purescript (how?) or switch to some other testing framework?
  
I&#x27;m quite comfortable with Haskell, and I have an existing Vue.js + Typescript application that I wrote (and host at https://iguanasuicide.net/) but I&#x27;m not really comfortable with npm / node / vue -- there&#x27;s no specification I can read ala the Haskell Report so I&#x27;m always uncertain when editing the configuration. I&#x27;m even uncertain on the latest Typescript changes -- I learned it from the specification that is no longer updated.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently come back to the world of emacs and this time around I&#x27;m using sway for my wm. everything has been file except the font in emacs is always blurry, I&#x27;m in void linux so I had the option to install the gtk3, gtk2, and Xorg versions of emacs. Since I was running a wayland based desktop I thought to install the gtk3 version since gtk3 natively supports wayland as far as I know. like I said everything is fine just the text is slightly blurrier then I would like and can&#x27;t seem to find a fix for my specific situation
 ​
 Also I did try setting GDK_BACKEND&#x3D;&quot;wayland&quot; and that just gave me an error saying gtk can&#x27;t find display &#x27;:0&#x27;

                    <span>When this hook runs, whatever function call is first in line fails. Then, the rest of them run as expected. Note that I merely copied item one to the bottom of the list, and from there it runs. First thought is, the function is autoloading but not fast enough to catch the first call. I&#x27;m often wrong, though. How to fix? Thanks.

                    <span>I apologize for this question but I have been trying this for a while and getting a bit stuck.
 I have installed the Emacs Application Framework and been messing around with it. It&#x27;s awesome, but I can&#x27;t play video files in it! As far as I can tell, everything is set up as it should be but it simply is not playing anything.
 Here is the relevant portion of my .emacs file:
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/&quot;) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/app/eaf-video-player/&quot;) (require &#x27;eaf) (require &#x27;eaf-browser) (require &#x27;eaf-pdf-viewer) (require &#x27;eaf-terminal) (require &#x27;eaf-video-player) 
 As you can see, the video player is indeed installed. I also installed qt-ubuntu from snap and ffmpeg from apt (I am on Ubuntu) to see if either of those would help (they didn&#x27;t but I haven&#x27;t restarted my computer since I installed those so maybe that would do something [update: rebooting did not do anything]?)
 The web browser, PDF viewer, and terminal work just fine (I haven&#x27;t messed with the other plugins yet). However, when I try to run the video player on a video file, this happens.
 As you can see, the video editor is in fact on, in some sense, but nothing is here! I am not a Linux or powerful text editor newbie (I am a recent veteran of Neovim which i customized heavily) so I know may way around installing stuff and troubleshooting, but I&#x27;m nowhere near experienced enough to debug super complicated issues, so I&#x27;ve found myself stuck here. Any ideas on what might be going on?

                    <span>I just came across Ctrl-Shift-E.
 It&#x27;s shy though:
  
it pops up a tiny window that disappears if I try to screenshot it (and comes right back after the screenshot is taken).
 
C-h k C-S-e doesn&#x27;t even help!?
 
C-q C-S-e doesn&#x27;t want to quoted-insert it.
 
Search engines have never heard of it apparently.
 
C-g doesn&#x27;t extinguish it. enter and esc do.
 
For both global and local, (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-S-E&quot;)) doesn&#x27;t unset it.
 
 So how does it behave?
 It opens a tiny window, that you can type in, and if you hit enter it places those contents at the cursor. But you can&#x27;t type spaces. The tiny window is draggable. The tiny window has a hardcoded character e at the beginning of it, for who knows why.
 What on earth is this?

                    <span>Using exwm I am hoping for a good emacs solution to viewing system processes and their resource consumption. For instance, I may want to see how much memory Slack is really consuming in my Firefox window. From the CLI something like &#x3D;top&#x3D; gives good information, but attempting to search for emacs wrappers of top has proved an exercise in frustration. What recommendations have you folks, for viewing resource usage of system processes?

                    <span>I have been a Emacs user for a year now . I don&#x27;t use a distribution of Emacs , I use my own init.el.
 I use evil mode and wanted to setup EAF Browser in my Emacs.EAF Browser works as expected but the keybindings between EAF and Evil clash . I have to switch to Emacs Mode for EAF and Evil Mode for others, this setup is very irritating and unproductive. How to use EAF Browser with only Evil Mode ?
 The EAF wiki only has instructions for DOOM Emacs and Spacemacs users , I tried to implement it for normal evil mode , but was unsucessfull. Does anyone have a setup they can share ?

 Could not deduce: Last ts1 ~ Last (t : ts1) from the context: ts ~ (t : ts1) NB: &#x60;Last&#x27; is a non-injective type family 
 From my understanding, the last type in the list ts1 must be identical to the last type in the list t : ts1, the presence of an extra item at the beginning should not have an effect on which item is at the end. Therefore, Last ts1 should be the same as Last (t : ts1), but GHC cannot guarantee this.
 What changes can I make to get my code to compile?

                    <span>About six months ago, /u/bgamari wrote up this update on the status of GHC on Apple M1 hardware.
 With the release of the second generation M1 CPUs this past week, I&#x27;m curious how much closer we are to building binaries targeting the M1 CPU using GHC.

                    <span>So, we have Control.Monad.Trans.Cont for continuations:
 &#x60;newtype ContT r m a &#x3D; ContT ((a -&gt; m r) -&gt; m r)&#x60;
 &#x60;type Cont &#x3D; ContT r Identity&#x60;
 &#x60;reset :: Cont r r -&gt; Cont r&#x27; r&#x60;
 &#x60;shift :: ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; Cont r r) -&gt; Cont r a&#x60;
 We have &#x60;shift&#x60; and &#x60;reset&#x60; for performing continuation, but it is hard to wrap my head around what these does..
 Like, what does &quot;captures the continuation up to the nearest enclosing reset&quot; mean?
 Why does it capture up to the enclosing reset? How does it interact with callCC and others?
 I am lost. Could you give me pointers on how to understand it?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 This might be a stupid or rather difficult question. When you are surfing on the web, and you come across a tutorial that you were looking for hours, and you consider that tutorial or parts of it a piece of gold to avoid boilerplate and save tons of hours of re-googling, how do you store that information using org-mode? 
 Technically speaking, we are talking about non-actionable information that could be used potentially in the future. Do you use org-roam for this kind of stuff or what? And how do you organize the files, independent from your GTD workflow (if you have)? 
 Would love to hear your methods, since I have a lot of tabs temporarily saved in bookmark on Firefox but I know that I would like to store that information filtered and processed by me. Thanks!

                    <span>Hi,I searched far and wide but, with my limited competency, I was unable to find a writing tracker for org-mode that could tell me how many words per hour I produce. I want to know this to become more prolific.
 Here&#x27;s an example writing tracker implementation done in Google spreadsheets: https://thespreadsheetwiz.com/automatic-writing-tracker/
 I don&#x27;t need something as elaborate. But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any solution that pairs word count with clock data.
 There are a few packages that will count words for you, such as org-wc, which produces nice overlays of total word count per subtree: https://github.com/tesujimath/org-wc
 Or tracktable that embeds a table with a daily word count into your buffer: https://github.com/tty-tourist/org-tracktable
 But nothing that combines word counts with clock data, both of which I have in my file.
 Unless I missed something? Please let me know if you know.
 I use DOOM if it makes any difference.

                    <span>Hi there
 My colleagues and I have developed an ECS (Entity Component System) framework as a final project for a university course.
 The framework aims to have the ECS architectural pattern adopted in an idiomatic and concise manner.
 Advice and suggestions are welcome :)

                    <span>The first edition is just waiting for imagery by @ctietze and the online course will be one of my focussed work for the next couple of weeks.
The next Zettelkasten-related topic will be mapping.
This article might be of interest to you:
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cognitive-mind-concept/
This will be one of the corner stones to connect the overall architecture of the Zettelkasten Method and thinking tools. Perhaps, I might even say integrate the tools with the environment.
The infobox on the right with all the *maps might be also of interest to you.

Cognitive Mapping is the initial reason for the image capture function in The Archive. It integrates the environment of thinking &quot;desk&quot; with the environment of thinking on your computer:

                    <span>Hi all!
 I&#x27;ve written a small &quot;proof of concept&quot; type package nrql.el for interacting with NewRelic (an application performance monitoring and logging tool). In my current job, I do a lot of investigation into our production issues. org-mode is a huge part of my daily workflow, and I wanted something that would make it easier to save NewRelic queries (and their results) in org-mode as I typically will export an org-mode heading to html to format the text in a way that is easy to share between many different services (Confluence/Jira/Github/ect.). 
 If there are any other NewRelic and Emacs users out there hopefully this is useful! Also, I&#x27;d love some feedback elisp wise as it&#x27;s my first serious attempt at writing a package for Emacs. A lot is still pretty rudimentary like error handling, but if you have interest in something like this let me know as it currently meets my needs, and I&#x27;m wondering if I should take it further.

                    <span>Starting with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, I then eval-buffer this buffer:
 (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/todo.org&quot;)) (setf (cdr (assoc &#x27;todo org-agenda-sorting-strategy)) &#x27;(effort-up)) ;; Sort just by effort (setf (cdr (assoc &#x27;todo org-agenda-prefix-format)) &quot; %i %-12:c %-6e&quot;)) ;; So I can see effort in the todo list 
 If I then do M-x org-agenda t, I&#x27;m presented with
 todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 However, if I comment out (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (i.e. using the built-in Org instead of the latest version), I get the expected output of
 todo: 0:15 TODO B todo: 0:30 TODO C todo: 0:45 TODO A 
 org-version and load-history confirm that the first version is using Org 9.5, while the second is using Org 9.4.4. Did sorting agenda items by effort change in 9.5?
 For completeness, inbox.org just looks like:
 * TODO A :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:45 :END: * TODO B :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:15 :END: * TODO C :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: 
 I&#x27;m on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and Org 9.5-g531577.

                    <span>In most programming modes, paredit-everywhere works by default, doing what I expect. Alas, it doesn&#x27;t in latex-mode, where I find myself spending more and more time.
 LaTeX looks difficult for the (incremental) recursive-descent parser one might use to hold a parse tree in-memory for structural navigation and editing. Is this a hopeless endeavor for an all-in-Emacs solution? Should I look into a tree-sitter plugin instead?

                    <span>I want to be able to select a region of text and wrap it with the \( \) that you use to input equations in org-mode.
 As far as I can tell, the way to do this would be to supply the output of (region-beginning) and (region-end) to a function that would insert text at a point.
 Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find a function to do this, or even functions to manually set the point, and then use (insert) to place the text.
 Am I going about this in the way? I know it&#x27;s a very simple task just to write the tags, but I have to do it a lot and would like to automate it.
 EDIT: I figured it out, the function is a little hacky, but it does work. Note: the mess in the (insert) functions is to make it output \( \), disregard it.
  (defun kcr/wrap-eqn () &quot;Wrap equation in org-mode markers&quot; (interactive) (let ((point1 (region-beginning)) (point2 (+ 2 (region-end)))) (goto-char point1) (insert &quot;\\&quot; &quot;\(&quot;) (goto-char point2) (insert &quot;\\&quot; &quot;\)&quot;)))

                    <span>With gccemacs becoming more popular and the option to provide gcc switches to native compilation itself I’m curious what performance enhancing flags others are using and why.
 This post e.g.mentions various benchmarks suggesting O2 doing better than O3 (and it’s a very recent post!). Besides that I like to use “-march&#x3D;native” but haven’t tried much more..

                    <span>I was doing a problem sheet to play around with haskell syntax and I have to write a function :
 graft :: Rose -&gt; [ Rose ] -&gt; (Rose , [ Rose ])
 graft &#x3D; undefined
 which takes a &quot;parent&quot; tree and a list of &quot;child&quot; trees and grafts each of the children to the leaves of the parent as we move from left to right. What is the most efficient way to do this?
 Notice how the function returns two pieces of data: the grafted tree as well as a list. This second value can be used if the length of the list of children does not match the number of leaves of the parent. For example, if there are not enough child trees in the list, your function should simply continue without modifying the remaining leaves and and return the grafted tree as well as the empty list. Conversely, if there are more children than there are leaves of the parent, then your function should return the grafted tree as well as the list of child trees which are left over.

                    <span>I have an exercise, where I have to write a function that returns True if the first parameter&#x27;s list&#x27;s length is larger than the second parameter (Int type).
 Now, there&#x27;s a test case where the first parameter is an infinite list ([1..]), therefore I can&#x27;t just simply write &#x60;| length x &gt; y &#x3D; True&#x60; in my pattern guard, since that would cause an infinite loop. How can I check if a list is infinite or not? If it&#x27;s infinite, then the function should always return &#x60;True&#x60;.
 ​
 EDIT: The second parameter is only a number, so my example should look like this:
 longer [1..] 3000 &#x3D;&#x3D; True

 for a long time, but before that everything was fine, one day this error just popped up and I certainly don&#x27;t know why. (My vscode is set to UTF-8 which shows in the right corner)
 I have looked up on google and found a similar problem in this google group. 
 Like if there is a {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} or a single line comment in the first line, this error will show up.
 Everything can build successfully so I think the problem is on VScode...
 Is there anybody encountered with the similar problem?

                    <span>This is a post introducing the new changes of Iron v1.1.2.
 What is Iron ?
 Iron is a type constraints (or type refinement) library for Scala 3. It uses Dotty&#x27;s inline and opaque types to evaluate constraints at compile-time.
 Here is a simple example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala def log(x: Double &gt; 0d): Refined[Double] &#x3D; x.map(Math.log)
 log(-1d) //Compile-time error &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 New features of 1.1.2
 Mathematics
 This release make Iron closer to mathematics by providing two features: - A new A / B alias which has the same meaning than x € A / B(x) in mathematics. The old A &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; B alias is kept but deprecated for retrocompatibility reasons.
  
A new algebraic system allowing the user to write their constraint like a mathematical equation: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala
  
def acos(x: Double / (-1d &lt;&#x3D; ?? &lt;&#x3D; 1d)): Refined[Double] &#x3D; x.map(Math.acos) acos(1d) //Right(0) acos(1.5) //Error &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Check this page for further information.
 Compile-time evaluation support for composed constraints
 Before 1.1.2, constraints like And, Or, Not etc... Weren&#x27;t evaluable at compile-time. They were evaluated at runtime only. This update now allows you evaluate complex/composed constraints at compile-time: scala def acos(x: Double / (Greater[-1d] &amp;&amp; Less[1d])): Refined[Double] &#x3D; x.map(Math.acos) acos(1.2) //Compile-time error 
 Note: Compile-time evaluation is also supported by the new algebra system.

                    <span>Hello, I am testing a method that deals with a Coordinate case class:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class Coordinate(azimuth: Double, elevation: Double)
 def method(arg: Seq[Byte]): Coordinate // represents a point on a globe &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I need the method to be approximately equal to the value corresponding to the catalog entry for the byte sequence that represents it. Basically, I need this test to pass:
 scala val testValue: Seq[Byte] &#x3D; ??? assert(method(testValue))(approximatelyEquals(Coordinate(azi1, ele1))) //values from spec catalog correlating byte sequences to expected Coordinate values 
 The signature of approximatelyEquals is
 scala def approximatelyEquals[A: Numeric](reference: A, tolerance: A): Assertion[A] 
 I am unsure of how to make this work with the Coordinate class. I need an instance of Numeric for Coordinate, but it doesn&#x27;t make much sense, since for example it&#x27;s not possible to order points on a globe.
 Basically what I need is to make sure that the elevation and azimuth values are close to the azimuth and elevation values that are expected. As it relates to the title, I need to get an ADT to understand the typeclass of its arguments, if it has arguments that all have the same typeclass as this type does.

The only place where I arrived is this: https://sr.ht/~pkal/compat/, that leads to a not found page here: http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/compat.html. Now, does anybody have any clue about what could be going on?

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know how well known or widely used they are, but I just wanted to say how blown away I am by the Modus Themes of Protesilaos Stavrou. Not only are they really beautiful but they&#x27;re incredibly clear (by design) and very customizable. I&#x27;ve stuck with the built-in deeper-blue theme for a very long time because of its clarity but this is the first theme that&#x27;s made me switch.

                    <span>Hello
 Which Emacs theme would you recommend for a glossy screen in order to minimize glare when working in a well lit environment. Currently I&#x27;m using doom-vibrant, and even though it looks great in a dimly lit room, when it gets brighter, there a lot of glare even with the screen at 400nits.

                    <span>For a long time, many Emacs users and I have always longed for tail-call optimization in Emacs.
 With the advent of Emacs 28&#x27;s native compilation, it&#x27;s only possible when we apply the highest available native-comp-speed (which is non-default) so it&#x27;s unreliable.
 Today I happened to jump into named-let in subr-x.el, which according to the manual can be used just like Clojure&#x27;s loop - which can be utilized in place of TCO funtions - therefore I decided to define a clone for the latter.
 lisp ;;;###autoload (defmacro clj-loop (bindings &amp;rest body) &quot;Evaluates BODY in a lexical context in which the symbols in the BINDING-forms are bound to their respective initial bindings or parts therein. Acts as a recur target.&quot; (declare (indent defun)) &#x60;(named-let recur ,(seq-partition ;; Convert vector to list (append bindings nil) 2) ,@body)) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp
 (clj-loop [i 0] (if (&#x3D; i (expt 2 20)) i (recur (1+ i)))) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 1048576
 (defun fibo-2expt (num) (clj-loop [a 0 b 1 n (expt num 2)] (if (zerop n) a (recur b (+ a b) (1- n))))) (fibo-2expt 3) ;; &#x3D;&gt; 34 &#x60;&#x60; Although initial expressions&#x27; indentations are a bit funny &amp; there&#x27;s no destructuring, I think it&#x27;s still helpful to share, because I haven&#x27;t seen anyone suggestednamed-let&#x60; as a built-in workaround for TCO. (Sorry for shamelessly ripping off documentation from Clojure&#x27;s).

                    <span>Hello all, emacs newbie here, been using doom emacs for a few months now and I just discovered Ivy childframe/posframe. It was working well a while ago but since last week it has been acting weird. By weird I mean it changes the position of the mouse cursor from anywhere in the screen to the top left of the emacs window as you can see in the video. What can be causing this?
 My system info:
  
OS: manjaro 21.1.6
 Emacs: 27.2
 Doom: 21.12,0-alpha

                    <span>This seems a strange problem, but I find no good spell checker which works for LaTeX files.
 For example, the built-in TeX-ispell-document checks contents in equations, which should be unnecessary.
 Does anyone have a good solution for spell checking a long LaTeX file?

 I was recreating my config for the 10th time and came across - https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter . I cloned the repo and every time I run the make compile, I get the following error:
 Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: org-babel-tangle-file
 make: *** [compile] Error 255
 The repo is a few years old so a few things may now be obsolete. I tried adding (require &#x27;ob-tangle) but it still won&#x27;t work.

 Help :)

                    <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m sharing a minimal recipe to build emacs with native compilation in macOS. More precisely, to add native compilation to your already working build procedure. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s extremely simple nowadays but also that instructions are scattered around the web, often outdated, sometimes hit-and-miss, sometimes buried deep inside complex build scripts that do a bunch of other things. So I wanted to get an up-to-date minimal working recipe and actually understand what I was doing instead of blindly copy&amp;pasting code. The outcome gladly surprised me as trivial.
 Assuming you have brew installed and have checked out emacs-28:
  brew install gcc brew install libgccjit ... ./configure --with-native-compilation ... 
 Remarks:
  
gcc is not the compiler used during the traditional build. Instead, the clang installed alongside your macOS command line tools will be picked as usual. But gcc will be the one compiling elisp to native code (please correct me here if I&#x27;m wrong).
 
--with-native-compilation flag is not required (it&#x27;s already the default!) but by adding it you ensure that any issue while enabling native compilation gets reported loud and clear. If there is any problem, try this in order to diagnose it: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html.
 
Be prepared for long build times. Also, you might feel disappointed the first time you launch your new build of emacs. But this is likely because the JIT compiler is compiling your packages (you may see a bunch of compiler warnings in *Messages*, new files appearing in ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache and some processes burning your CPUs).
 
I&#x27;m on Big Sur 11.6.
 
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve been using it for a while it&#x27;s really, but really, snappy! Now that I&#x27;m typing in this reddit textarea it feels clunky as in 2 hours average latency.

                    <span>Hello everyone, I am in a dire need of some help, we are forced to do haskell in our school and I don&#x27;t understand it in any way, it&#x27;s only for one semester and then we&#x27;ll never use it again, would there be a kind soul to help me with the homework? If so here is what I have to do
 Implement the function puzzle, it will simulate the game similar to 15 Puzzle. In our case, we have 25 squares, where 24 squares are ocupied by tiles with big case letters from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;X&#x27;. One tile is free, it is denotated by &#x27; &#x27;. In one move, you can move a tile (denotated by its letter) into the free one. The function gets the original configuration and a sequence of valid moves. It will output the resulting configuration.
 If anyone would help me I would really appretiate it, though I am quite broke so I can&#x27;t afford paying, I am rellying on generosity and charity of this community

 padzip :: [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [(a,b)]
 padzip [] [] &#x3D; []
 padzip [] ys &#x3D; []
 padzip xs [] &#x3D; []
 padzip (x:xs) (y:ys) &#x3D; (x,y) : padzip xs ys
 results should look like this:
 padzip [1, 2, 3, 4] [True, False] ~&gt;* [(1, True), (2, False), (3, False), (4, False)] 
 padzip [4.2] [42, 24, 21] ~&gt;* [(4.2, 42), (4.2, 24), (4.2, 21)]

                    <span>I would say ReactiveX is the most popular implementation of reactive programming outside Haskell. There is RxJS used heavily by angular, there is even RxJava - but i can&#x27;t find RxHaskell, except the archived github repository from 2013. Are there any good reasons why there isn&#x27;t an implementation? :(

                    <span>Hello,
 ​
 I found this interpreter for the lambda calculus using de Bruijn Notation and GADTS:
 https://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/functional-programming/2013/Code-20140123.lhs
 data FExp :: * -&gt; * -&gt; * where 
 App :: FExp e (a -&gt; b) -&gt; FExp e a -&gt; FExp e b 
 Lam :: FExp (a, e) b -&gt; FExp e (a -&gt; b) 
 Var :: Nat e a -&gt; FExp e a &gt; 
 ​
 data Nat e a where 
 Zero :: Nat (a, b) a 
 Succ :: Nat e a -&gt; Nat (b, e) a
 ​
 My Questions is: Whats the best way to parse expressions like \x y z -&gt; y to something of this type? 
 My problem is that i need a state to return the right Nat e a.
 Would it be better to write an Type FExp&#x27; that can also contain lambda expressions that are not well typed and write a parser with type String -&gt; FExp&#x27; and a second function of type MonadError m &#x3D;&gt; FExp&#x27; -&gt; m FExp&#x27;? Thanks for your help.

                    <span>I use emacs, search for it in helm-ag, then use helm-ag-edit to bring up a buffer with all the results, then use evil-mc to edit the results that are actually a valid instance of that identifier. 
 I feel like there&#x27;s gotta be a better, cleaner way to do this. At the moment it seems like lsp-rename isn&#x27;t working (maybe that&#x27;s coming soon as the haskell-language-server rename plugin becomes usable?). I&#x27;ve looked at retrie but can&#x27;t find any instructions for how one would go about changing an identifier. Does anyone else think they have a better method that&#x27;s ready to go?

                    <span>Hi
 I&#x27;m confused as to why the last line in the following code gives a compile error
 type CacheObject a &#x3D; { fetch :: forall m . MonadEffect m &#x3D;&gt; m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m &#x3D;&gt; CacheObject a -&gt; m a get c &#x3D; c.fetch 
 while the following does not
 type CacheObject a m &#x3D; (MonadEffect m) &#x3D;&gt; { fetch :: m a } get :: forall a m . MonadEffect m &#x3D;&gt; CacheObject a m -&gt; m a get c &#x3D; c.fetch 
 The compile error starts with
  Could not match constrained type MonadEffect t3 &#x3D;&gt; t3 a1 with type m0 a1 
 Can someone explain why this is?

                    <span>sealed trait Foo { def toString: String } class Bar(x: String) extends Foo { override def toString: String &#x3D; { return &quot;Bar (&quot; + x + &quot;)&quot; } } class Baz(y: Int) extends Foo { override def toString: String &#x3D; { return &quot;Baz (&quot; + y.toString + &quot;)&quot; } } 
 ​
 How do I add I implement Foo.equals(Foo) for Foo / for every extending class? (So Bar.equals(Foo), Baz.equals(Foo) would need to be implemented.)
 Ideally Bar(x1) &#x3D;&#x3D; Bar(x2) &lt;&#x3D; x1 &#x3D;&#x3D; x2, Baz(y1) &#x3D;&#x3D; Baz(y2) &lt;&#x3D; y1 &#x3D;&#x3D; y2.
 Does it need to be a sealed abstract class rather than a sealed trait?Foo must be sealed because I need to use pattern matching.

                    <span>I am not new to Scala but new to Akka. I went to their website and there are a bunch of things like &quot;Akka Serverless&quot;, &quot;Akka on AWS&quot;, &quot;Akka persistence&quot;, &quot;Akka streams&quot;... They all have their own documentation and almost appear as separate projects. I just want to learn Akka at HOME on my own mini Raspberry cluster without paying AWS or playing with hosted PaaS or blah blah. Can someone give me a 2-minute breakdown of what I need to get there? It is all a but confusing :-). Thanks!

                    <span>I started working on play application in Job. But really want to know. How much its been used in market &amp; Carrier opportunities ? Is it worth learning for new developer ? Question came to mind due to this post https://www.lightbend.com/blog/on-the-future-of-play-framework

                    <span>The scripting language for the new Yarn 2 is prolog. I was putzing around with it today, learning something about it and trying to get it functional in Emacs. After a restart, this stuff suddenly appeared in *Messages*. 
 Emacs IDLWAVE mode version 6.1_em22. HTML help location not found: try setting ‘idlwave-system-directory’ and/or ‘idlwave-html-help-location’ Cannot locate IDL Assistant, enabling default browser. Loading system routine info in idle time... Failed to convert XML routine info, falling back on idlw-rinfo. [...] 
 Whaat? All I did was add ob-prolog, set a var for the program name, and put a #+SRC block in an Org file. Well, almost all.
 After getting schooled on Interactive Data Language and Emacs&#x27; IDLWAVE package (it has an info manual), and an hour of my life I&#x27;ll never get back, I tracked down the issue. I had created a prolog code file, likes.pro, and guess what file extension IDL files have. I had a likes.pro buffer and IDLWAVE liked it. 
 Fun fact: one of the authors of this package is Carsten Dominik.

                    <span>Hi, I was recently messing with my numworks calculator, on which I run [https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/\~parisse/giac.html](XCAS) via KhiCas. I see that you can run Xcas under emacs as well, but I largely have to use khicas because of the memory limitations on the calculator, I trust there are better desktop-oriented cas systems out there 
 Is there 1. A good CAS for Emacs, and 2. Can I link it into Emacs-Calc?

                    <span>Hi, I have reached the end of recruitment process from a course-driven company that offers internship at the end. The last stage is - presentation.
 As a person who wholeheartedly dislikes microsoft office, I decided to work with org mode presentation. I tried out the default themes from reveal.js and I noticed they are minimalist (which is very pleasing but I was wondering-
 Data Science people I know uses microsoft office regularly and makes extensive graphical presentations. So will a minimalist presentation be bad for such environment?
 Which matters during a presentation (optional: in DS)? 
 Main Question: From your experience (optional: as a data analyst), which theme/configuration do you use to do regular presentations?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a large code-base using AutoLISP/VisualLisp - an old dialect of Lisp specific to AutoCAD. Please don&#x27;t stop reading now.
 For about 20 years the program used a built in IDE+debugger called &quot;VLIDE&quot; (Visual Lisp IDE). This program does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but is terrible.
 They have now deprecated this and urge people to use VSCode, which has some sort of LSP support via an Extension
 Supposedly this does all the cool stuff I need in VSCode. I would much rather use Emacs!
 What is involved in making this work with the best editor? Is it a drop-in replacement of some sort? Is it legal?
 I don&#x27;t really know how remote debugging works, even though I used it in my Java/EE days.

                    <span>New minor mode for emacs org-mode :)
 It adds bars to the virtual indentation provided by the built-in package org-indent.
 I hope you will like it.

                    <span>I&#x27;m developing a library for a bigger project which might be generally useful so I intend to publish the package if I end up finishing the project. I have not really used any logging framework with Haskell and from my research there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a defacto standard. Let&#x27;s say I use co-log in the library wouldn&#x27;t this force this onto people who want to use my library in their project? Should I not implement any logging at all and then add the logging in the parent project? Kind of miss just being able to put console.log(), console. error() where it&#x27;s needed and not worry about logging in the first place.

                    <span>Hello,
 I installed org-ref to work with references for a paper and I can&#x27;t get my Bibliography to show up when I render the PDF. The References are also marked as [?]
 When I run org-ref in emacs, my bibliography shows up and I don&#x27;t get any errors. I can also search and cite entries. They just don&#x27;t show up when I render as PDF or HTML
 I assume its because all I have in my Init file is, but I tried other configs I found online and could not get it to work.
 (use-package org-ref
 :ensure t)
 ​
 In the org file itself I have:

                    <span>Hi everyone. I recently started learning Scala, I know very less about it until now. I setup Visual Studio code for Scala, installed an extension called &#x27;metals&#x27;. I also installed scala and sbt on my OS. I already have jdk-openjdk (which is version 17 currently) installed.
 I researched a little bit and found scala 2.13.6 supports jdk 17. Still everytime I open a Scala file on VS Code, it asks me to install jdk 8 or 11 specifically. The twist is I can compile and run my programs on both on my distro&#x27;s terminal emulator as well on vscode terminal emulator.
 I just want some additional knowledge based on above issue happened with me and what if I completely uninstall jdk-openjdk and install jdk11-openjdk?
 would I be able to compile and run both Java and Scala programs piecefully (errors aside Lol).
 Thanks for your time and efforts.

                    <span>All, 
 I have around 15+ years of experience in java and most probably in mood to start a job as a scala developer from scratch. 
 Do you guys think its worth to make a move, just to learn scala and get hands on ?
 Let me know if there is any perks , cons to this.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new here!
I know the Zettelkasten method for two years now. I tried to use it, but I always have a problem with mathematical equations. Having to type them in LaTeX is very tedious, I wish I could draw them by hand at early stages of a note and maybe later write them with LaTeX. Do you know some tool that could work for me?
Thanks</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with using a clean build from straight.el in order to reproduce a bug I&#x27;m chasing down, but got sidetracked in this endeavor by experiencing some other weird behavior (a familiar story to all the members of the Church, I&#x27;m sure).
 I launch Emacs with emacs -Q -l ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el, then evaluate the following buffer.
 (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (require &#x27;org) (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-agenda (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/todo.org&quot;))) 
 After this, I do M-x org-agenda t, move the cursor over an entry, and do C-c C-x e to assign an effort. If I then do e.g. &quot;0:15 RET&quot; though, I get a &quot;Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: org-duration-to-minutes&quot; error. Weirdly, this error goes away if I remove the line (require &#x27;org) from the above config.
 I&#x27;ve checked, and the straight.el build files for org do have org-duration-to-minutes listed as an autoload in org-loaddefs.el. I feel like my brain is just mush after the work week. What am I missing?
 edit:
 I&#x27;m on GNU Emacs 27.2, with Arch Linux, Linux 5.10.64-1-lts x86_54, and the latest version of Org, 9.5-g531577.
 Doing M-x list-load-path-shadows yields the same results for both of these cases - after running org-agenda, 114 packages are shadowed (everything from the built-in org is shadowed by everything in straight/repos/org).
 The load history is a lot to parse through, but the only important thing I&#x27;ve found so far is that after I call org-agenda, org-loaddefs.el appears in the load-history of the version without a require statement, but not in the version with a require statement.
 edit2: Solved! See my comment below.

                    <span>I just noticed that Magit is on the Hacker News frontpage, with a link to a nice write-up about it from 2017:
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;28954058
 Many here have probably already read the linked article, but more attention for Emacs is always a good thing! I also note that Jonas Bernoulli had some interesting things to say to the about the design of Magit: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;28958785

                    <span>Diddling my modeline config, I accidentally made it resistant to mouse clicks. After I reverted it, I looked for how this functionality is toggled. I found two variables, modeline-mousable and modeline-mouseable-minor-mode. Also spelled mode-line-mousable and mode-line-mousable-minor-mode. The former configures the active frame/window, the latter the inactive.
 &#x27;(mode-line-mousable ((t (:foreground &quot;cyan&quot; :background &quot;#007080&quot;))))
 I find no documentation on them. &#x27;Look up symbol in Info&#x27; fails. &#x27;apropos&#x27; fails. Everywhere I searched, fail. 
 Obviously, they work. Every theme I examined that configures the modeline uses them to set the mouse behavior. But from where?
 edit Or, maybe, I&#x27;ve missed the boat and make-mode-line-mouse-map is the key. But what does it have to do with themes?

                    <span>I use lsp-mode for some time now and am very pleased with it. I use it for python development.
 In my init I added a hook for python-mode like this:
 (use-package lsp-mode ... :hook ((python-mode . lsp)) ...) 
 When I want to use python code with org-babel I often switch to org-edit-special with C-c &#x27;. When I do this python-mode gets loaded but not lsp-mode? Is there a way to start lsp inside the org special edit buffer?
 Thanks for any help!

                    <span>I&#x27;m using tab-bar-mode , and I would like to force each buffer to have it&#x27;s own tab. When I close the buffer I would like to close the tab. (Excluding buffers that are not visiting files).
 At the moment I&#x27;ve bodged together a mix of functions to try to get this behaviour, and generally works, but not always (for instance when use org-refile to jump to a subheading in another file (which I do constantly)).
 I&#x27;m wondering if there might be a simpler way to achieve this behaviour? (Not a programmer, really struggle with this stuff). 
 Thanks in advance for all help, but: please don&#x27;t just tell me I shouldn&#x27;t be using tabs in the first place. I know many look down on tabs, and I have tried using buffers only for 2 years, and I hate it. I need some on-screen visual representation of the buffers I have open.

                    <span>Hello, Emacs people!
 I am an average non-technical Emacs and Anki user. 
 So, when I thought of integrating spaced repetition into my notetaking process (so I can work on my topics with less context switching), I discovered a variety of options.
  
Org-drill https://gitlab.com/phillord/org-drill/
 Pamparam https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam
 Org-fc https://www.leonrische.me/fc/index.html
 Anki-editor https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor 
  
Do you use any of these regularly, and what are your impressions and suggestions, if so?

                    <span>According to this website at the bottom appendix for removed packages it would appear redhat 8 no longer has gccjit: rhel8
 Why would they do that? And does it mean the end of native compilation for emacs built there?

                    <span>I’m trying to use backpack to do some limited form of polymorphic unpacking (which GHC unfortunately does not support ‘natively’). Essentially, I want something like:
 data Node a b &#x3D; Leaf {-# UNPACK #-} !b | Node {-# UNPACK #-} !Index {-# UNPACK #-} !a {-# UNPACK #-} !Index type Index &#x3D; Int bimapNode :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Node a b -&gt; Node c d bimapNode f g &#x3D; \case Leaf b -&gt; Leaf (g b) Node l a r -&gt; Node l (f a) r 
 for particular types a, c, b, and d. The issue that I&#x27;m essentially running into is that I&#x27;m not sure how I can get my hands on the copies/instances of the &#x27;Node&#x27; type used by the library that implements &#x27;bimapNode&#x27;. A more detailed/precise description of the problem, a minimum &quot;working&quot; example, and my attempts so far are at https://github.com/noinia/nodedemo . (it&#x27;s a bit unweildy to describe the problem while flattening everything in one textual question; hence the ref. to a git repo that contains the proper file layout). Does ideas on how to proceed with this kind of thing?

                    <span>What career paths are available for working in haskell? From what I&#x27;ve seen, the options are backend developer, compilers and research, but I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts. What options are there? Not asking about any specific job position or technologies, just career paths in general working with haskell.

                    <span>Since I wrote about a year ago that I am working on https://simplex.chat project, a small Haskell reddit group was exceptionally supportive - thank you all!
 I&#x27;ve spent a few weeks exploring which platform we should use to build our mobile apps - and Flutter/Dart with its unified compiled UI and a decent cross-platform seemed a strong contender. But having implemented the core transport protocol in dart, I do have some doubts...
 Having come through all the options, I&#x27;ve read that people use Swift across all platforms (iOS/Android/Mac/Windows) for applications logic, as Swift is an LLVM compiler, so it produces very fast binaries that run on Android without JVM.
 So, I am now thinking, wait a second - Haskell GHC is also an LLVM compiler. A short google search shows that people do compile Haskell code to both iOS and Android. And we already have most of the protocol logic implemented in Haskell - people use our SimpleX chat via terminal...
 While this all seems doable, the compiler configuration and low level bindings are a bit over my head - I am an application developer, so lots to learn here. Would anybody here who has the experience with Haskell on iOS / Android be interested to join the project (terms TBD) to at least help us set it all up, if not get involved longer term?

                    <span>BLUF: Can I set the &quot;ORDERED&quot; property on one line?
 I have a series of TODO tasks, and I want to set them to &quot;DONE&quot; in the order I do them. org-enforce-todo-dependencies is set to &quot;t&quot;.
 I set the &quot;ORDERED&quot; property like this for a few lists: :PROPERTIES:
 :ORDERED: t :END: 
 This looks inelegant to me. 
 The manual gives this example for single line properties:
 #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
 Can I do something like this:
 #+PROPERTY: ORDERED t
 I have tried it for a few lists of tasks, but I cannot get it to work. I don&#x27;t know if that is because I am doing it wrong, or if it&#x27;s not possible.
 Edit: the single lines for &quot;PROPERTY&quot; are supposed to start with a pound sign and a plus, but Reddit markup wants to display them as headers; I added a space and another pound sign. 
 The single line syntax is here

 It is my perception that programming parallel, asynchronous programs seems alot easier these days with all of these solution components working well together.

Induction without core-size blow-up by Edsko de Vries &amp; Adam Gundry
The approach described there does however not directly apply to the case of anonymous records. This is the topic we will tackle in this part 2.

                    <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m using anki-editor to export anki cards from my notes. It works fine for english text, but it&#x27;s not working for portuguese text - it has punctuation like à ã á â.
 It gives me this error:

 How can I fix this?

 Edit: I was using url-retrieve instead of curl. Changed it back and fixed the error.

                    <span>When I use the find-file-other-window command, if my current frame is already split into two windows(via C-x 2) it will open the file in the other window. 
 However, if I have two ui frames open(via C-x 5 2), and I use find-file-other-frame, it always opens a new frame. How do I get it to reuse the existing other frame? The one that would be selected by C-x 5 o.

                    <span>Hey there. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to export my org-mode agenda to a text file. The same text file every time, so that can be hard-coded into the function. 
 Here&#x27;s the problem:
 1) I&#x27;m running windows native build.
 2) I&#x27;d like it to run every hour without needing emacs to be open.
 Those two problems together put it way out of my knowledge area. I could probably figure out how to pipe the command to a text file, and I know I&#x27;ll want to use Task Scheduler to do the update timing, but how do you tell emacs to spit out that much data without opening it? It seems like it&#x27;s going to be difficult.

                    <span>Hi, I am working on setting up Emacs as essentially a Mariadb dev environment. I am wondering is any other SQL devs out there have figured out if/how emacs can export data from a SQL query output to a CSV. I have seen that Org-mode can do table exports, but it seems that it can only do that for exports made from Org tables and not database tables. (also, somewhat new to emacs and I have really messed with org-mode at all so I might be misunderstanding how all that works).

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I have had a problem with emacs for a while (occurs in 25.3, 26.3 and 27.2 all the same) when trying to save files in certain folders on Windows. I get the following error message:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments #f(compiled-function (ad--addoit-function filename &amp;optional wildcards) #) 6) ad-Advice-copy-file(# &quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; nil t t) apply(ad-Advice-copy-file # (&quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; nil t t)) copy-file(&quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; nil t t) backup-buffer-copy(&quot;d:/Sync/testfile.txt&quot; &quot;c:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/backups/!drive_d!Sync!testfile.txt~&quot; 438 ((acl . &quot;O:S-1-5-21-1032860327-2127226913-1604572573-1001G:S-1-5-21-1032860327-2127226913-1604572573-1001D:(A;;FA;;;BA)(A;;FA;;;SY)(A;;0x1301bf;;;AU)(A;;0x1200a9;;;BU)&quot;) (selinux-context nil nil nil nil))) backup-buffer() basic-save-buffer-2() basic-save-buffer-1() basic-save-buffer(t) save-buffer(1) funcall-interactively(save-buffer 1) call-interactively(save-buffer nil nil) command-execute(save-buffer) 
 What exactly &quot;certain folders&quot; means I am not so sure about myself unfortunately. I can give a couple examples:
  
Standard Windows folders (e.g. &quot;Program Files&quot;)
 Folders managed by the App &quot;Sync&quot; (syncs local files with cloud storage)
 The Goolge Drive App, which does basically the same, does NOT give me this issue UNLESS I share the folder in question with other users
 My work-pc is managed using Windows Intune, on this device a cannot save a file anywhere using emacs
  
I really hope someone has an idea, I am completely lost here. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>What would be the idiomatic replacement for Racket&#x27;s in-cycle in Emacs Lisp?
 Simple example and totally not something I use: 
 #lang racket (define (mock msg) (list-&gt;string (for/list ([c msg] [f (in-cycle (list char-downcase char-upcase))]) (f c))))

                    <span>As of recent, I have been getting this error:
 byte-code: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-file-name-concat 
 whenever I called org-roam&#x27;s (org-roam-node-find) function.
 I was getting this error on a Linux machine (Arch) and on an Mac machine, both running Emacs 27.2. I tried installing v. 28, but the problem persisted.
 I then noticed that, if I loaded and evaluated the file org-compat.el (in org-mode&#x27;s lisp directory), the problem didn&#x27;t occur. The function referred to in the error message (org-file-name-concat) is defined in that file, and is conditional upon a specific version of Emacs.
 I discovered that the problem was caused by an incompatibility of sorts between the (old) version of org-mode installed with Emacs on my machines, and the (newest) version of org-roam installed by straight.
 Apparently, Emacs loads the old, default version of org-mode rather than the newer one installed later by straight (something which other users have noticed before).
 My fix consisted in deleting the old version from my machines.
 On Linux, I deleted the org directory on /usr/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 and on Mac, on /usr/local/Cellar/emacs-plus@27/27.2/share/emacs/27.2/lisp/
 I wanted to shared this information with other users who might be experiencing similar issues.

                    <span>I often run emacs in terminal by &#x60;emacs -nw&#x60;.
 When using Wayland/Sway, how can I copy a text region out of emacs to another window?
 When I use Ubuntu with X, I can do that by selecting the region, and alt+shift+\, and type &#x60;xsel -bi&#x60;.
 Thanks.

 &quot;There was an unexpected error&quot;
 &quot;Error: could not find package gitconfig-mode...)
 I noticed this post earlier on this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/qcec4k/gitmodes_now_available_from_nongnu_elpa_and_melpa/
 I&#x27;m assuming this is causing the issue?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve written a transient.el menu with enough columns of shortcuts that the text starts to wrap at the right part of the screen when viewing on a smaller laptop display. Is there a best practice to modify the size of a transient&#x27;s window? Ideally I&#x27;d like to remove the wrapping continuation lines of the transient&#x27;s buffer, as the wrapping disrupts the layout of all the text. I&#x27;d also like to limit the transient window&#x27;s height, though I&#x27;ve been playing around with transient-display-buffer-action without luck. If I could limit the window height and width, I&#x27;m guessing transient-scroll-up and transient-scroll-down would allow me to see whatever parts of the transient buffer are hidden by making the window smaller...
 The only working solution I&#x27;ve found is to use the predicate keywords (e.g., :if, :if-nil) to change up my transient&#x27;s column arrangement depending on which computer I&#x27;m on, for example:
 (transient-define-prefix my-transient () [&quot;MISC&quot; [:if (lambda () (string&#x3D; system-name &quot;MY-LAPTOP&quot;)) (&quot;R&quot; &quot;Avy Char in Line&quot; avy-goto-char-in-line) (&quot;P&quot; &quot;Pop Mark&quot; avy-pop-mark) (&quot;DEL&quot; &quot;Other Buffer&quot; other-window)] ] [&quot;Help&quot; [:if (lambda () (string&#x3D; system-name &quot;MY-LAPTOP&quot;)) (&quot;SPC&quot; &quot;Avy char&quot; avy-goto-char)] ]) 
 But I would prefer the solutions in the first paragraph if possible. Thanks for any help!

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to build a fairly complicated scan operation (basically there&#x27;s a stream of bytes and the scan needs to identify key values and form &quot;sentences&quot;). For code cleanliness reasons I&#x27;d like to put that in a transducer, but I don&#x27;t see a relevant transducer method in https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.zio/zio-streams_2.12/latest/zio/stream/ZTransducer$.html. Fold is the closest thing, but to form sentences I need history. Is there a reason it&#x27;s impossible to do as a Transducer?

                    <span>So I love Scala. It&#x27;s the kind of love that every time I try to explore some new language, Scala comes in the way whispering &quot;this language lacks this and that&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve tried Rust, Go, Kotlin, Clojure, and more. None of them is as awesome as Scala... And I&#x27;m good, really good actually.
 (Yet... What&#x27;s with Travis Brown? Holy fuck, is this guy&#x27;s purpose in life is to slowly suffocating the community?)
 Besides that... At some point it felt like it was evolving crazy fast. There was a new shiny amazing library to explore every month... And now there&#x27;s just promises in the air and Scala 3 hasn&#x27;t really taken off, and seems like it just won&#x27;t.
 There&#x27;s also the job offers. From what I&#x27;ve seen, only some companies in Europe are hiring (mainly in the Netherlands), and the positions they offer are that of a Senior Scala Engineer with no possibility of growing.
 Also, the speed in which the Scala ecosystem grew in the previous years left every company using Scala, having a mix of styles in their software. Some using Play, and then Akka, and then Http4s (with tagless final) and then ZIO and modern functional effects libraries.
 I feel like I fell in a pit of overspecialization and now I can&#x27;t leave.

                    <span>Scala-native is exciting! Looking forward to not having to use sun.misc.Unsafe to escape performance issues due to GC pauses.
 But will scala-native be able to run without a mandatory GC since scala-library itself does not allocate and deallocate memory manually?
 If a GC is required then does that mean that the problem of &quot;having a mandatory GC&quot; &amp; &quot;GC pauses&quot; (similar to JVM) also exists in scala-native unless there is a version of scala-library written in scala-native?

                    <span>Type-checking plugins for GHC are a powerful tool which allows users to
inject domain-specific knowledge into GHC’s type-checker. In this
series of posts, we will explore why you might want to write your own plugin, and how to do so.
I: Why write a type-checking plugin?
II: GHC’s constraint solver
III: Writing a type-checking plugin
In this first blog post of the series, I’ll be outlining a few
examples that showcase some limitations in GHC’s instance resolution
and type family reduction mechanisms. With a type-checker plugin, we
are no longer restricted by these limitations, and can decide ourselves
how to solve constraints and reduce type families.

Instance resolution
Recall how GHC goes about instance resolution, as per the user’s guide.
A typeclass instance has two components:

                    <span>The problem with Emacs and its modes is that you can not simply install something and click some minutes around to get an idea about if it could fit your needs or not. Some question comes up with all the (for me) known possibilities with ZK around emacs.
In the context of ZK I currently started using zetteldeft which is build on deft.
What is the difference between zetteldeft and deft - in description of feauters?


What is the difference between org-mode and org-roam?


Do I understand it correct that org-roam use sqllite database instead of plain text files? In that case it would be disqualified for ZK.


What is the diff between org-roam and zetteldeft?


Any other suggestions in the context of Emacs here?</span>

                    <span>I am pleased to announce that I have released Git-Modes on NonGNU Elpa as well as on Melpa. Git-Modes provides three simple major modes for editing Git configuration files.
 Previously these modes were available from Melpa as three separate packages named gitattributes-mode, gitconfig-mode and gitignore-mode. These packages have been removed and you should remove them locally too and then install git-modes, but make sure that it is already available before you do. That can take a few hours.
 The motivation for merging the packages into just one is that while many users may only regularly edit .git/config and maybe .gitignore, it is not such a bad thing if a major mode is ready to go when they first open .gitattributes.
 More in the announcement.

 As in the title; I can&#x27;t even change states, and the indicator in the modeline stays the same regardless of the keys I press.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>First, thanks to everyone for all their help and suggestions to my previous questions in this subreddit - very grateful to hear the cumulative experience of many Emacs users!
 My question here is about generating images from LaTeX source blocks in .org files
 The following source block (edited down to a simple use case) works fine and produces a .pdf, but this does not appear in the document when using org-display-inline-images.
 #+header: :packages &#x27;(&quot;\\usepackage{tikz} \\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric, arrows} &quot;) #+begin_src latex :file figure.pdf :results raw file \begin{tikzpicture} \draw[red,thick,dashed] (0, 0) circle (1cm); \draw[blue, thick, dashed] (0.5, 0) circle (1.5cm); \end{tikzpicture} #+end_src

 I am using pdf-tools and when I call the outline buffer, it open in a vertical split. Is there any way to make it open with say, a fixed width instead? I have looked around for this in other people&#x27;s configs and can&#x27;t seem to find anything. Thanks!

 I’m a fairly new emacs user (I’m using doom emacs) and I wonder if it’s at all possible to make company add brackets to a function call so for example it inserts print() instead of print and makes me insert brackets by myself. Thanks in advance!

 Recently, I learned about the starship prompt and i quite liked it. Since I use the eshell a lot i would like to know if there is a way to use the starship prompt with eshell. 
 I have already read about the Eshell on emacs wiki and the Starship guide but since I have zero idea about the lisp language i wasn&#x27;t able to figure something out.

 I haven&#x27;t written any decent elisp code for ~3 years now and admittedly I have forgotten the little elisp knowledge I used to have. Upgrading doom-emacs has been a challenge for me as it&#x27;d be difficult to deal with possible breakage. (Also, sorry to admit that but I have also shifted some editor usage to neovim.) I am not able to properly maintain https://github.com/MaskRay/emacs-ccls anymore. There has been a few client-side issues I would probably never know how to address.
 Would it be a good idea to merge emacs-ccls into lsp-mode and take advantage of the large community? :) Apologies that I probably am not able to help much on the migration...
 If you are interested, please let me know. If you use emacs-ccls, please show your interest, it may help someone to get decided:)
 Feel free to rename functions or variables. I still know how to adapt my key bindings:)

                    <span>I love emacs zone, to fool out peoples. It feels i&#x27;m some kind of mythological creater or some hacker type. But,
 When enabling zone, it runs on different buffer removing current buffer code, It makes me very unintresting because i&#x27;ve tabs. 
 Here is my code without using zone
 https://preview.redd.it/bg9vezz4jmu71.png?width&#x3D;1480&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;6f27a94d010855b1fcb4207e14420db8a7d80907
 when not enabling zone, my tabs, (config.el, packages.el) remains same and i&#x27;m ok with that.
 ​
 ----- but when enabling zone this happens in tabs
 https://preview.redd.it/enzxyewajmu71.png?width&#x3D;1920&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;923dbd01bb66a6674d23b2d54359f28a35e33cec
 It runs another buffer zone with other hidden buffer, and it looks so clutter and unromantic.
 ​
 Is there any way to use zone on the top of that code rather than opening to saperate buffer like in image 2, (with like that showing other tabs, than the tabs i&#x27;m running. I just want to on top of my code. 
 Thank you

                    <span>I have fixed a warning from flycheck about using forward-line instead of next-line, but the warning still remains.
 Is there some kind of state caching which causes this?
 What is odd is that the underlining is on the following line, rather than the forward-line command itself.

                    <span>I installed the emacs-27 in my windows-10 PC using WSL2(Ubuntu). Everything works as expected (like in a normal Linux installation) except some key bindings are non responsive. The most annoying one is the M-d (I use it for forward-kill-char/word). I suspect that this key is set to something in the windows and stopping emacs from accessing it. Any idea what it can be. I have searched a lot but not able to find the solution yet.

                    <span>... or, Why are you up at 0400 reading Emacs NEWS files?
 From the NEWS file for v27.1
 *** &#x27;byte-compile-dynamic&#x27; is now obsolete. This is because on the one hand it suffers from misbehavior in corner cases that have plagued it for years, and on the other hand experience indicates that it doesn&#x27;t bring any measurable benefit. 
 Wut? There&#x27;s no upside to being lazy? Dang it.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to set up LSP over TRAMP, but having issues. Based on https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/remote/
 (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-tramp-connection &quot;pyright&quot;) :major-modes &#x27;(python-mode) :remote? t :server-id &#x27;pyright-remote)) 
 is loaded in my emacs. 
 When a opening file on the remote, lsp-log shows &quot;Command &quot;pyright&quot; is not present on the path.&quot;. 
 If I run which pyright in a terminal outside of emacs, that is ssh&#x27;d into the remote, it returns the path for pyright: /snap/bin/pyright However, running the same from eshell returns &quot;no pyright in 
. So emacs seems to be searching for pyright on my machine, when it should be searching on the remote? I tried to add (add-to-list &#x27;tramp-remote-path &quot;/snap/bin/&quot;) based on https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-programs.html , but same result.
 How do I make Tramp find pyright on the remote machine?

 I’m interested in using emacs to edit my LaTeX files. For reference, I’m coming from using TeXstudio, to give a suggestion to what I’m hoping for. It seems that auctex is the de-facto standard package for editing TeX files, but do y’all have any recommendations on configuration / auxiliary packages / gotchas?

                    <span>I started doing Project Euler problems a while back using Haskell exclusively, and so far the language has worked pretty well. In particular, the language facilitates writing code using reusable components (e.g. a lazy list of primes, a function to check whether a number is a palindrome), and also benefits from utility libraries (e.g. Control.Monad, Control.Arrow, Data.List, Data.List.Ordered) and from a few other conveniences (Integer type, ^ operator). 
 Those of you who have done Project Euler with Haskell and some other language(s):
 What other languages did you use?
 How did Haskell compare to the other languages that you used?
 Do you agree with my assessment of Haskell&#x27;s strengths?
 Btw please refrain from sharing solutions to problems

                    <span>Errata: This is a repost with a different title of a post I just deleted, since the old title &quot;Is Haskell a better Python?&quot; created substantial confusion, and Reddit does not allow the changing of post titles. The original post-thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/qbvfsh/beginning_programmer_here_is_haskell_a_better/
 ​
 I&#x27;m just a noob with a copy of &quot;Haskell From The Very Beginning&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to ask:
 ​
 Is Haskell a better Python? As in, Python is a deliberate attempt to make a very accessible programming language, but guess what? The textbook I just bought has 127 functional pages (albeit extremely concise ones).
 ​
 I&#x27;m wondering if Haskell might be a better Python for people beginning to code; i.e, people complain about Monads this,
 https://preview.redd.it/kqvdmwedanu71.png?width&#x3D;892&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;4165714f28e616ac30685a8095ca34fcb68427c1
 that, but a lot of it comes down to people starting with imperative paradigms.
 ​
 The benefits, likewise, are substantial. Haskell, in comparison in other programming languages, is very hard to make bad code in (because it simply won&#x27;t compile). For non-programmers coming into programming, Haskell is a way to learn to code but also to produce a relatively high-quality of code, whereas Python etc might be easier to learn, but it&#x27;s far easier to produce spaghetti code in other languages. Moreover, selling Haskell as &quot;a better Python&quot; to non-programmers also helps enlarge the Haskell community, leading to better library, compiler, and other forms of support, while making it so that many future programmers start from a functional paradigm instead of an imperative paradigm.
 ​
 Edit: I did contact Haskell Foundation about this subject, but I&#x27;d like to message them permission to post e-mail contents first, and I&#x27;d rather finish a few Haskell textbooks beforehand so I don&#x27;t feel like a poser before I do so.

                    <span>I lately grokked that Haskell just reveals the very nature of imperative program, or sequential code, that a thread of execution (by machine, as well as reasoning by human), is essentially single item (thus monadic) data dependencies chained together.
 IO has a phantom (yet magical) RealWorld item in the chain (though only at type level, not present at value level), you can imagine every IO step receives a new version of the RealWorld from the previous step. While ST has an even more general abstraction of it.
 Human brains seem to take single threaded reasoning for granted, so procedural code would appear more &quot;natural&quot; to humans. But data dependency is inherently &quot;multi-threaded&quot;, thus how referential transparency is more &quot;natural&quot; to the physical nature.
 We human perceive a single RealWorld despite multiple versions of it along the temporal axis. But thinking the data dependency way, no such single RealWorld actually exists at all, just as in Haskell (at value level).
 Then we have real difficulties in reasoning about effects (mutation done to the &quot;world&quot;) applied, if not sequentially organized. How &quot;unnatural&quot; we human are. Anyhow, imperative programs reflect this bug/feature of our cognitive workings, including monadic Haskell.

                    <span>Hi,
 I have seen that there are packages that allow you to generate (say) desktop-notifications for scheduled todo-items and the like, but what is a bit unclear about these solutions is how to make sure that Emacs is in fact running when a notification is supposed to be generated?
 Do you have Emacs always running in server-mode or do you start Emacs in batch mode every now and then via a con-job or how is this done in practice?
 Many thanks.

                    <span>EDIT: Solved
 I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to neaten up my org mode documents and keep coming across org-hide-emphasis-markers, which when set is supposed to hide various emphasis markers in org mode. But I can&#x27;t find it, e.g. when typing M-x. I&#x27;m on running Doom Emacs, Emacs 27.2. Is this option deprecated???
 Many thanks!

                    <span>As the title suggested, I am searching for a way to describe an algorithm and/or pseudocode.
 Any idea? Thank you very much in advance.

                    <span>When opening an org file, I get the error File mode specification error: (void-function org-element-keyword-parser). Oddly enough, this error does not go away until I open a code block with C-x ‘ and close it, after which I can restart the mode to have it work properly again.
 Is there something I’m doing wrong? I’m using the default configuration of org (which I loaded with use-package and straight.el)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered this, but keep forgetting to ask:
For those of you who only use timestamps and/or alphanumeric IDs, how the hell do you find stuff?
I&#x27;m guessing you perform keyword searches, and then follow the links embedded in the notes themselves? But, especially if you&#x27;re using a timestamp, is there no way for you to simply scan through the file list and drop into a note that seems interesting based on the title?
Absolutely no judgment from my end. I&#x27;m genuinely curious who you approach your workflow, as I see a lot of diehard fans of the title-free approach, and just wondering how you navigate with it.
PS- In case you&#x27;re wondering, I use alphanumeric/tree with a title attached:</span>

                    <span>&quot;A Zettel is a Note.&quot;[1] I clearly remember the first time I read this line. The term is German, and the whole idea of a Zettelkasten was a foreign subject.  Thankfully, I could wrap my brain around an index card file or “slip-box,” because I had made a feeble attempt years ago to keep my growing pile of notes in just such a box. And because I was old enough to have used a library card file to look up books, I felt I might be able to handle this methodology for note-taking created by Niklas Luhmann.
My first recorded journal entry is around age 5 ---just a few lines of neatly penciled words describing what I did after school.  I have scattered notes and journal entries through junior and high school; however, it wasn’t until I read The Majesty of Books by Stirling W. Sill (around age 21) t…</span>

                    <span>As part of the second step of the Barbell Method of reading, I read the citations I denoted as useful to me.
This poses a problem: Reminding myself to read those citations.
I&#x27;ve attempted the following:
Add to my next actions list to add the citations to Zotero, then read them
Tag the items in Zotero that contain interesting citations
I&#x27;m kind of unsatisfied with these approaches. Not sure why. Could be a problem with my workflow or that the approaches themselves are inappropriate.
What do you think?</span>

                    <span>Q: Is there a Gmail Labs or some sort of add-on that would give each email a unique identifier similar to the one that The Archive creates?
I use Alfred to create a timestamp for YYYY.mmdd.hhmm for everything on my hard drive and in Google Drive... It makes finding and drilling down things so much easier.
One can just type in 202109301009 and boom pdf or spreadsheet shows up in finder....it&#x27;s like having an ISBN number for files. [I tend to use the format with periods.. e.g.  2021.0930.1009 since my brain reads this easier, and I can just type 2021.09 and find all files created in september of 2021]
If Gmail could do something like this automatic like The Archive, it would be so much better. 
Many Thanks,</span>

                    <span>Reading this manual is about as much fun as &quot;we need to talk&quot; with the spouse. Every once in a while, there&#x27;s a gem, though.
  Since changing properties counts as modifying the buffer, it is not possible to remove a ‘read-only’ property unless you know the special trick: bind ‘inhibit-read-only’ to a non-‘nil’ value and then remove the property. 
 The secret is out.

                    <span>edit: reposted with more clarity
 Org-refile offers the option to refile either to the top level of a file, or underneath a heading in that file - is there an equivalent for this with linking? I&#x27;m looking to write a function that will return a hierarchical list of all open Org files as well as the headings inside of them, and allow me to insert a link to any one of them, without having to leave the current buffer to store a link, or enter the heading manually.
 You can kind of patch this together using counsel-org-goto-all, which provides an alist of all headings from all open Org files, with entries (HEADER . MARKER). Just write your own Ivy action that uses (concat &quot;file:&quot; (marker-buffer (cdr x)) &quot;::*&quot; (car x)) in order to build the destination of the link and pass it to org-insert-link, then call that action on a goto-all candidate.
 However, this feels pretty bootleg, and doesn&#x27;t work when linking to files. I tried concatenating the results of calling counsel-outline-candidates and counsel-buffer-or-recentf-candidates, but this doesn&#x27;t give a nice hierarchical structure, and you have to start doing a bunch of ugly conditional stuff to tell if you&#x27;re dealing with a file or a heading inside the action. Is there a simple facility that Org or Ivy/Counsel provides in order to return a candidate list of open Org files and the headings in them, like Org-refile provides?

                    <span>Hi,
 Sorry if I disturb you with it!
 I have a working setup with lsp and mainly use org, haskell, web (and of course emacs) development ...
 Tried to config a simple layout (main and side windows only).
 I would like to share it with you maybe somebody can see it useful.
 it can help and it can be a good point to start with a working emacs ...

 I dont&#x27; want to start a new distribution I just put lot of work in it and maybe you wont need to do it again :)
 good luck!

                    <span>I generally don&#x27;t use the mouse &#x27;at all&#x27; in Emacs, and find that some buffers showing a highlight where the mouse pointer is to be very distracting. (Maybe a theme problem of coloration?)
 ex: In Selectrum/marginalia/orderless if I hit find-file and start typing something, and the filter list is say 10 items long.. if the mouse _happens_ to be in the bottom couple inches of screen, well, Selectrum will show a full width highlight on the row the mouse is on; which can mean that as you&#x27;re typing, you&#x27;re seeing two highglight lines - the one that is targetted by seledtrum if you hit (say) return, and the one the mouse is over. Its annoying since they colour the same (maybe fixable in theme, I&#x27;ll check.) 
 Likewise, in buffer+ buffer listing, the mouse will highlight a row, as will the one I&#x27;m looking at with the keyboard.
 Changing themes (if a buffer supports a face for mouse at all) all over the place could be error prine and annoying.
 What I think I&#x27;m proposing is .. define (say) a minor mode that causes the mouse pointer to be ignored, hidden, or even blocked (don&#x27;t let the mouse enter the confines of the window the mode is applied to?) ... then I could add some hooks on say prog-mode to add this minor mode (as well as minibuffer, say). It woudl be easy to selectably add this minor mode, thus leaving everythign else to work as normally.
 *shrug*
 Any ideas?

                    <span>I love these global minor modes like Helm, Ivy, Selectrum, or Vertico, which all display a list of completions in the minibuffer that filters and updates the display with every key press. But their user interfaces are always operated only from within the minibuffer.
 Are there any Emacs Lisp packages like these which could display almost exactly what you would see in the minibuffer, but in an actual buffer as a major mode instead, along the lines of ibuffer but for listing arbitrary strings and not just listing buffers?
 I would like a tool that works in Emacs sort of like how you would use &quot;dmenu&quot; to make a menu from text taken from STDIN. But for my use case, I would like to take an arbitrary newline-separated list of strings and make an interactive menu out of it in a separate Emacs buffer. Also it would be nice to have the ability to re-order list elements, the ability to mark elements (like you would do with files in Dired), and the ability to copy the list of marked items to the kill ring or else insert the list of items as a string into some other buffer, the same way that pressing &quot;Enter&quot; in Dmenu will dump the selected items to STDOUT.
 So for example, I would maybe select a region of my text buffer, press my key chord to turn that text it into a menu buffer in a new window, filter/rearrange/select elements, then press Enter and replace the region from whence it came.
 Does anyone know of a major mode like this, or a way of configuring something like Vertico to work in the way I described? Or alternatively, is it possible to use something like ibuffer or list-buffers for displaying arbitrary lists of strings rather than just buffers?

 I tried to use c-b, which it is too much bigger. I also tried to use &quot;c-t-z&quot; zen mode, but :( it works only on that text file not other files get bigger , also same goes to &quot;c-x-+&quot;. 
 ​
 Any doctors , here, would you please help me , how can i add font size, and it would be not hard to look to codes until i die. Thank you.

                    <span>OS: Arch linux with 5.14.11 kernel.
 I compiled emacs (using the AUR package) which is currently at version 29 but I installed and compiled it when it was still version 28. 
 emacs --version GNU Emacs 28.0.50 
 In my config I have the following snippet:
 (advice-add &#x27;ido-find-file :after #&#x27;bhr/find-file-sudo) (defun bhr/find-file-sudo () &quot;Find file as root if necessary.&quot; (unless (and buffer-file-name (file-writable-p buffer-file-name)) (find-alternate-file (concat &quot;/sudo::&quot; buffer-file-name)))) 
 When I visit a system owned file like /etc/pacman.conf 
 Previously I would be prompted for a password and after I entered it the file would be opened ion a buffer read/write. 
 It seems tramp behaviour has changed though. For quite a while now I see: 
 Autosave file on local temporary directory, do you want to continue? (y or n) 
 Typing y opens the file in as buffer read/write but without prompting for a password. 
 Typing n after the Autosave prompt leads to a weird situation
 I see a message - Unsafe autosave file name
 (Buffer is opened read-only)
 New tramp buffer appears with name &quot;*tramp/sudo root@
&quot; and the following contents:
 /root 
 Try to visit again and there&#x27;s no prmopt and the buffer is opened read-only again. 
 Kill the tramp buffer. 
 I&#x27;m not sure why tramp behaviour changed but:
  
 How on earth does tramp open a file owned by root using sudo without prompting for a password? 
 Is it possible to have tramp prompt me for a password again the way it used to work.

                    <span>Tonight, I ran package-autoremove after deleting some packages manually - and every package it removed was a package in use. I mean, it removed use-package, for cryin&#x27; out loud. Along with bind-key and some treemacs auxiliary packages. This actually isn&#x27;t the first time this behavior has occurred, so I was watching for it. 
 I mean obviously, don&#x27;t use package-autoremove anymore. But wow. What is the method it used to determine that use-package was no longer need?

Org 9.5 is out, but last time I tried using org-cite it didn&#x27;t work - this big feature&#x27;s entire documentation is a single blog post. While the excellent org-ref (which I used extensively) - was upgraded and now can use CSL; should I just stick with org-ref and be done with it?

                    <span>I am working with angles that get represented as follows: the hexadecimal representation of an angle is
 def formula(angle: Double) &#x3D; Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360 // and then convert to byte array 
 Some examples:
  
30 degrees maps to 1555 (or Array(15, 55))
 -30 maps to AAEA (or Array(234, 170))
  
I can get it working fine for the first case:
 val transformedAngle &#x3D; BigInt(Math.pow(2, 16) * angle / 360).toByteArray 
 That yields the expected result of Array(15, 55), but putting in 330 (complement of -30) yields Array(0, -22. -86) instead of Array(234, 170) which is not what I want at all. How do I fix this?
 ​
 EDIT: I ended up doing this super manually, using the knowledge that the result of the formula must be fit in two bytes (as it is 2^16 times a number less than or equal to 1). I set
 val second &#x3D; formula(angle) % 256 val first &#x3D; (formula(angle) - second) / 256 Array(first, second) 
 IDK why this had to be so manual, but it works.

                    <span>Hello again, I&#x27;m here to ask about opinions and recommendation of mostly battle tested tools, frameworks and libraries for working with WebAssembly in this beutiful language, either on JVM or LLVM backend.
 I really enjoy using Scala for web backends (currently using it at work), and here is a little step, are there any libraries for running client-side Scala on the web? I&#x27;m impressed by how it works in F# (OCaml implementation for .NET, not realy comparable, I know), they made Balero, toolchain based on Blazor for C#.

                    <span>Coming from Java world perhaps i&#x27;m not fully achieved yet the Scala mindset of solving some problems. I&#x27;m interested in building an Scala 3 extensible app, whose behavior could be extended, customized via plugins. Bonus points if those plugins could be loaded/unloaded on runtime and their clients be notified accordingly.
 Possible solutions I&#x27;ve thinking about so far:
  
Overriding DefaultPluginManager from https://pf4j.org/ so the class can be aware of sbt generated classes (may not work with bloop/metals generated random name directories). But have trouble with Akka classloader, so I &#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll ever would work.
 Use https://github.com/moditect/layrry which is based on Java Modules. Not tried yet. Sbt does not recognize module-info.java which is essential for it to work. Possible solution is implement an Sbt Plugin. But, I don&#x27;t know if at the end this would work in development mode which is important.
 Mess with an OSGI runtime and spend 3 months figuring out how to make it work with Scala ecosystem.
 Implement the application around https://github.com/softwaremill/macwire and hope the wiredInModule feature (which support dynamic loading) would be ported to Scala 3 soon.
 Building a sort of dynamic bundler that compiles the application along with extensions using Scala 3&#x27;s given/implicits feature. (although technically that would not be a plug-gable architecture)
 distage-extension-plugins looks very promising but it&#x27;s no ported to Scala 3 yet.
 Using a DI framework like Airframe, but it doesn&#x27;t support dynamic loading.
 Using Guice? :-(
  
Is there any more Scala principled way of achieving that? or another paradigm that helps building a dynamic app ecosystem through plugins/extensions in Scala? or another long-term software management strategy or architecture that could work?
 PD: The reason I really really need Scala 3 is because I want to make it around new ADT implementation and use type-class derivation from them.
 Thanks!

                    <span>We&#x27;ve been looking to hire Scala developers, and we give a simple coding problem that I expected candidates to typically solve with a one-liner with a filter and a sum, but instead most all are preferring a 5-line solution with foldLeft.
 Should I take that as a sign of inexperience with the language? Are there shops that prefer foldLeft as a matter of style? Or is this one of those weird situations where the interview distorts things because candidates assume interviewers don&#x27;t want you to use &quot;built in&quot; functions? Are other companies demanding the use of foldLeft in interviews? Thanks for any insight that will help me judge fairly.

                    <span>Here is how you can speed up parsing and serialization with circe from 10% to 110%!!!
 🕸️ Tested on message samples from real world APIs!
 🩸 Works with Scala 3!
 🗡️ Validation of the input UTF-8 encoding for free!
 ☠️ Ability to parse/serialize from/to Array[Byte], java.io.InputStream or java.nio.ByteBuffer!
 🦇 Ability to parse streaming JSON values and JSON arrays from java.io.InputStream without the need of holding all input and parsed values in the memory!

                    <span>Hi guys. Actually I was firstly going to learn scala 3 but I found that the documentation is in development and I currently might not be able to purchase a udemy/udacity/coursera/any other course, so hoping for financially free resources to help me learn. Hope you guys could relate. I want to ask, is scala 2 documentation enough to learn and clarify concepts of scala. I know a few other resources too such as, a geeksforgeeks tutorial, coursera&#x27;s courses, devdocs.io, and a few other websites. I am learning C (mainly) [ik slow pace] since march I guess and python 3 also. I have basic knowledge of some data structures too. So, if I follow above resources and practice coding on my pc, would it be enough. Have any advice, sure. I&#x27;m happy for that. idk what else to say, so. [Edit: I think I am also comfortable at command line, I use GNU/Linux OS as my daily driver.] Thank you for giving me your precious time and help.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve never fully delved deep into all of Emacs features and customization. I use Latex a lot for my math and physics assignments and I want to migrate from Overleaf to Doom Emacs.
 I have no idea how to begin, I really just want a split screen view with the .tex file on one split and the PDF file on the other split that refreshes and shows changes on every save of the Latex file.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use it in conjunction with ob-sagemath, so that I can use .org files instead of Jupyter notebooks for Sage code. 
 I have Sage installed via Anaconda, so I have to use conda-env in to activate the environment variables etc. for Sage. I do the same with Python environments in org src-blocks and have no problems.
 Unfortunately I keep getting the error message 
 Error: You must set the SAGE_ROOT environment variable or run this script from the SAGE_ROOT or SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/ directory.
 Not sure what to do to fix this... (other than perhaps install Sage outside a conda environment, but I don&#x27;t really want to mess my (user) Python system)

                    <span>I don&#x27;t trust my hardware from my previous experience of losing files during tweaking around. So I decided to back everything up. Thats when i thought to keep everything in google drive.
 Pros:
 - Everything in online so you have no fear of losing them.
 - You can access them from anywhere without much configuration.
 - Its secured and scalable (gsuite is cheap)
 - Its available online all the time
 Cons:
 I have yet to face one.
 ​
 Configuration:
 - I used rclone to mount the google drive locally and then I can access it like regular directory structure. I did not face any noticeable slowdown during ivy-auto completion.
 - One issue you might face is - auto-saving. Slow-down occurs during auto-saving to remote storage so I just set a local directory as my auto-save destination.
 Here is a brief guide about my steps to set it up. (I am a newcomer so I would appreciate any suggestion.)

                    <span>Hi,
 Lately I was wondering about the most efficient/canonical way of quickly doing one thing (yes, only one) following a coundition result.
 In elisp, we have two possible constructs for that (at least?): and and when/unless.
 For exemple, at the very beggining of my configuration file, I have currently the following line:
 (when (fboundp &#x27;tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 From a generic point of view, is there any more value to use and instead or not?
 (and (fboundp &#x27;tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode 0)) 
 Because if when is just a macro or something like that around if, I wonder if it is more efficient to directly call and?
 Thank you very much for your insight.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve had trouble getting indentation correctly configured in js2-mode for a long time now, and I&#x27;m finally just sick of it. I&#x27;m using editorconfig, and the indentation is sometimes right, but for chained calls it&#x27;s basically never correct. Here&#x27;s an example.
 const doAThing &#x3D; Promise.resolve(something).then(doSomething); 
 Looks harmless enough, right? But decide to split that line up, and you get THIS:
 const doAThing &#x3D; Promise.resolve(something) .then(doSomething); 
 Having my js2-basic-offset set to any value you care to name does absolutely nothing. What I want is this:
 const doAThing &#x3D; Promise.resolve(something) .then(doSomething); 
 I&#x27;ve tried using js2-bounce-indent-p (nothing happens when I hit ), I&#x27;ve made sure indent-tabs-mode is set to nil, I&#x27;ve tried with and without electric-indent-mode enabled (the same thing happens either way, it just happens when I type ( with electric-indent-mode enabled as opposed to when I hit  with it disabled), I&#x27;ve tried figuring this out for longer than I am comfortable admitting, and I&#x27;m just really frustrated at this point. It feels like emacs is trying to be really clever, when all I really want is for it to indent by the amount specified in my .editorconfig file whenever an indentation is called for.
 What am I missing?

                    <span>I have declared the following datatype
 data Poly a &#x3D; Poly [a] 
 and also a class:
 class Polynom p where substitute :: p a -&gt; a -&gt; a compose :: p a -&gt; p a -&gt; p a 
 I can make the datatype an instance of the class:
 instance Polynom Poly where substitute &#x3D; ... compose &#x3D; ... 
 I also want a Ratio of a Poly to be an instance of the same class; I have tried many syntaxes and language extensions, but none of them work; things like:
 instance Polynom (Ratio . Poly) where ... -- error: cannot use (.) there instance Poly p &#x3D;&gt; Polynom (Ratio (p _)) where ... -- error: no wildcards allowed type X a &#x3D; Ratio (Poly x) instance Polynom X where ... -- error: X needs another param instance Polynom (* -&gt; Ratio (Poly *)) where ... -- error: wrong kind 
 My goal is to be able to have substitute and compose work on a Ratio (Poly *); for example:
 rf &#x3D; Poly [1,2,3] % Poly [4,5,6] :: Ratio (Poly Int) result &#x3D; substitute rf 10 :: Int 
 Is this even possible in Haskell? If so, what syntax or language extension am I missing here?

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to implement data schema validation through static type checking as explained in the following video between 5:23-8:46: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;BfaBeT0pRe0&amp;t&#x3D;323s
 The idea is that data schema is validated at runtime and the validations are represented as static types that can constrain the operations that can be performed on a given variable after it was validated.
 For example, let&#x27;s take a machine learning dataset with tables, and a table named &quot;emails&quot; which has many fields, amongst these are: &quot;personid&quot;, and &quot;email&quot;. A query result can be checked whether the returned data matches a set of validators, and then the returned variable will have these verifications expressed as its static type.
 For example:
 data EmailsTableColumns &#x3D; PersonId | EMail class Col a in…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I am the author of aeson-pretty, a JSON pretty-printing library compatible with the popular aeson.
 I am currently not using aeson-pretty myself, and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Yet it has a good number of dependent projects, including a few high-profile ones. So it would be a shame to abandon it.
 If anyone from the community enjoys using aeson-pretty and would like to contribute/take over, I would love to hear from you.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi r/haskell,
 I am Shuai. I am from a group of researchers from Monash University in Australia who are interested in making visual tools to assist in teaching and learning the Haskell language. I created the Chameleon type debugger to help Haskell programmers better understand types and solve type errors. You can check out our talk and our paper at ICFP2021. 
 If you know Haskell (whether you are a beginner or a veteran), I want to invite you to participate in my online user study (code challenge). You can check out some features of the Chameleon debugger during the study. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 10 - 15 minutes to complete. But it will help us immensely. Click this link to proceed https://blend.ercu.be. 
 P.S. I know this is a form of self-advertisement after all. And therefore I have checked with the mods beforehand. To my surprise, they quite welcome my post here.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

I saw a lot of helpful point-free „tools“ lately, including ((.).(.)…), but it‘s mostly trial and error for me using the type checker. I would love to see a systematic way to achieve this step by step, but I am also unable to see the next step. Please see my process in the comments. It’s a function calculating seconds from hours, minutes and seconds. Hints in small steps appreciated. :)

                    <span>Lists in Haskell are often used as persistent generators rather than data structures. This usually works very well, but can result in massive space leaks. Consider the contrived example below:
 main &#x3D; print leak list &#x3D; enumFrom  [0..] bigNumber &#x3D; 10000000 leak &#x3D; map (\n -&gt; list !! n !! bigNumber) [1..100] 
 I reworked this example to avoid space leaks by defining a Gen typeclass which supports generators of infinite lists:
 {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} module Main where main &#x3D; print noleak genlist &#x3D; EnumFrom  [0..] noleak &#x3D; map(\n -&gt; gens !! n &#x60;idx&#x60; bigNumber) [1..100] bigNumber &#x3D; 10000000 -- For potentially terminating generators, val :: a -&gt; Maybe b and next :: a -&gt; Maybe a class Gen a b | a -&gt; b where val :: a -&gt; b next :: a -&gt; a newtype EnumFrom &#x3D; EnumFrom {value :: Int} instance Gen EnumFrom Int where val &#x3D; value next &#x3D; EnumFrom . (+1) . value idx :: Gen a b &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Int -&gt; b idx a n &#x3D; val $ iterate next a !! n 
 Although this approach works, simply being able to use a list would be far more convenient.
 My question: is there a way to make lists not leak space, or is there at least a solid library for non-memoizing iterators and generators?
 Edit: Thank you for the answers given so far! They have been very helpful.

                    <span>There is a legacy code base that uses SQUERYL that I need to live with. 
 Basically I want to support an API for querying data from a table with a filter. Squeryl has this lovely thing called a LogicalBoolean which from my understanding is used to deal with some nubby equality issues. 
 I would like “most people” to not have to “know about” logicalBooleans. Instead I would like to accept a function of the form
 (OrderObject &#x3D;&gt; Boolean) And then underneath the hood I transform this to an (OrderObject &#x3D;&gt; LogicalBoolean) and pass that along to Squeryl.
 Is this something that can easily be done? I assume it mustn’t be otherwise it would just be in the Squeryl framework itself

I use with my students a specific week system which does not match the week numbering in the year calendar. Therefore, I would like to have a display of a different week number which I could customize.

                    <span>So this is my story in a nutshell: So i am using vi since twenty years and never looking back. It&#x27;s so snappy, easy and powerful etc etc. I did try the evil spacemacs to get some decent IDE for doing IDE stuff. After a crack in the time space continuum somewhere in Berlin i woke up with Rust and got tricked into .. Microsoft visual code. 
 Please don&#x27;t judge me, throw the first stone if you are without sins, i mean, vscode runs on Linux and MS became Linux platinum partner so Torvalds himself took part in leading me into the valley of death and despair. However, I understood my mistake in misery and pain while writing a plugin for vscode. The attempt to map a keystroke to a JavaScript function i wrote took me more then 16 hours and many tears.

                    <span>I have made a minor « normal mode » for personal use, basically mapping navigation or editing commands to keys instead of self-insert-command. I mapped  in prog-mode to switch to it and it&#x27;s been serving me well.
 Recently, I had the idea of extending the normal mode bindings when a specific major mode is active. Specifically, I want  in my normal mode to call markdown-edit-code-block, but only when markdown-mode is active.
 I didn&#x27;t want to add a binding that checks what the major mode is with cond and whatnot, as it didn&#x27;t seem like a very clean or modular solution. Instead, I created a second minor mode with the one binding I need for markdown-mode and set it as a buffer-local variable. Now, when my normal mode activates, it checks whether the variable is non-nil, and calls it.
 It works, but since I don&#x27;t know everything about emacs, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has encountered this problem before and if there&#x27;s an even simpler solution that I&#x27;m missing.

                    <span>Emacs goes back to default after I close emacs rather than applying my config file . I’ve tried quitting with the key bindings. Also I’ve refreshed emacs with m-x:load-file and m-x:eval buffer while in my config file. Doing this temporarily applies my config but than I close out of emacs and it goes back to its default. I’m using emacs on Linux.
 Edit: I wrote theme in the title but I’m talking about my config file as a whole

                    <span>I have been messing with my .emacs, so it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ve broken something, but I have no idea what…but at any rate, as of sometime today I can&#x27;t get to any of the emacs package archives, and I&#x27;m getting a particularly odd message regarding MELPA in particular.
 Whether through package-list-packages or eww, I get certificate errors when trying to reach melpa.org, saying that its certificate has expired. However, it doesn&#x27;t expire for two months—and Emacs certainly seems to be aware of what the correct date is.

 And we have to make it so the type &quot;Fraccion&quot; is declared like this: 
 data Fraccion a &#x3D; F1 a | F2 a a | F3 a a a 
 So that functions can use Integrals as elements for the type. 
 We are desperate, since we can&#x27;t find anywhere how to make &quot;instance&quot; work like this, any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

                    <span>So I was making a little program I originally had written in (rather functional) JavaScript and wanted to replicate the functionality in Haskell, so I coded, googled some stuff every now and then, and eventually needed strip and a replace from to(which I manually wrote). I had written the entire thing (still rather small here) using the normal string (or [Char]) type. Though after reading up on how I could make a strip function I found out using Text is apparently a lot better overall and already has a strip function built-in (tho no replace from to). So I ported my program to using Text and noticed that some functionality just flies out the window which I did use quite a lot (Pattern matching for example), or is rather cumbersome to use (Concatenation, especially to normal strings; comparing with normal hard coded strings (less so than concat))
 So how should I replace such things when using Text? Constantly writing T. (as the package says one should) isn&#x27;t really all that nice either, though I mind that less. I&#x27;m mostly missing the pattern-matching/recursion stuff and being able to easily compare/concat a Text to a hardcoded string. The constant T.append (T.pack &quot;my string&quot;) myText just feels really verbose and unwieldly compared to &quot;my string&quot; ++ myText... The program does a lot of string (or well... text) manipulation, using pattern matching and concatenation quite a lot
 I&#x27;m currently on ghc 9.0.1

 Im following this tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;SadfV-qbVg8) to learn yesod better.
 but as soon as I do this :

 defaultLayout $ do $(widgetFile &quot;posts/new&quot;)\&#x60;\&#x60;\&#x60;

 I see this error

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m becoming fond of using ConTeXt instead of LaTeX for smaller documents. I was wandering if I could tweak org-mode&#x27;s LaTeX export function to use ConTeXt instead.
 My investigations found no pre-canned solution so far. It doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to me either: although it seem somewhat straightforward for me to convert the header and sectioning part to the ConTeXt markup, it really doesn&#x27;t for itemization etc.. I was wondering if there&#x27;s someone who has already archived it and can share his/her wisdom on this. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hey, I see more active people in org mode than in org roam sub reddit, so I put the question also here:
 I installed org roam yesterday and I struggle to put other properties aside the default ID property. I tried a &#x60;%^{testprop}p&#x60;
 in the capture template, but it says &quot;Capture abort: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil&quot; I&#x27;d like to had a capture option that puts and asks properties (like : capturing a book, with the a property : &quot;object: book&quot; and another property &quot;author: &quot; that I&#x27;m prompted to fill, for instance.
 But if I remove the &#x60;%^{testprop}p&#x60;
 it works just fine if i put things like &#x60;%^{thing}&#x60;
 ... it&#x27;s just for properties that seem to have a problem. Also, I tested &#x60;%^{testprop}p&#x60; in a org capture template (not org roam) and it works fine.
 Here is my org roam part in my init file: (But if there is just a simple way you know, without debugging my init, i&#x27;d be glad too.) 
 &quot;&quot;&quot;
 (use-package org-roam :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom ;:todo: doesn&#x27;t work (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) (org-roam-directory &quot;~/dossiers/perso/org_mode_dir/org_roam/&quot;) (org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t) ;:todo: doesn&#x27;t work (&quot;t&quot; &quot;test&quot; plain &quot;%? %^{prop}p&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;%-${slug}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t) )) :bind ((&quot;C-c r l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c r f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c r i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert)) :config (org-roam-setup))

 HTML export
 Is there anyway to make Latex previews appear as it should, in this case, in multiple lines?

More specifically, I don&#x27;t understand why depth is a parameter to measureDepth, where it is coming from, and how the depth is being calculated in measureDepth.

 Like anyone who is learning a new langue it&#x27;s normal to search about jobs, and I&#x27;ve notice that in almost every job description ask to you have experience em 3 languages Java, scala &amp; phyton, then, my question is: 
 It&#x27;s really mandatory knows all this languages to get a job with scala?

                    <span>Hello Scala community
 It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve last coded in Scala and things have certainly moved fast. Previously, I have created a Scala 2 Play API project as a learning exercise. Would you be able to give it a quick browse, and advise how I could upgrade/improve it to leverage Scala 3 features? Thank you!

                    <span>I have recently been reading through notable &quot;commencement addresses&quot; by famous people, some of whom I recognize and admire, such as John Brodsky, Kurt Vonnegut, Bill Watterson, Neil Gaiman and Richard Feynman (and many others).  It struck me that this material would be an excellent source for people new to the Zettelkasten world, who might like to practice writing zettels from short and interesting (but not too demanding) essays.  It might even prove to be the source of some zettels that you want to include in your own ZK 
See: https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/20/the-best-commencement-addresses-of-all-time/
My apologies that these seem to be US-centric, likely due to the predilections of the person preparing the compilation.  If there are other sources of which you are aware, from other countries or cultures, please post a (some) link(s) to them.</span>

A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing that creates an interconnected web of thought. Its emphasis is on connection and not mere collection of ideas.

                    <span>I (current maintainer of Elpy) am not able to properly maintain the project anymore.
 Looking at the number of issues and PRs, the project seems to have a decent number of users and to be valuable to the community. I thinks it would be a shame to see it disappear due to my inability to keep it afloat...
 On the last discussion on the future of Elpy on github, some people showed interest in participating in its development (thank to them !). But a main maintainer to coordinate the whole thing and deal with core issues is still highly needed.
 If you are interested, please let me know, if you use Elpy, please show your interest, it may help someone to get decided :)

 The title is the short version. I&#x27;m new to both Lisp and emacs and there are not really a lot of paths for seriously learning Common Lisp that don&#x27;t eventually point to emacs as the best development environment for Lispers. This is great, I&#x27;ve been enjoying poking around emacs quite a bit, even if I&#x27;ve broken it a few times on the learning curve.
 Anyway, when I was poking around for options I came across Portacle an emacs fork designed to be a super portable and straight forward emacs implementation with all of the bells and whistles (like SLIME) for a Lisp developer built in.
 Portacle itself had some trouble with saving desktop preferences across sessions, UI scaling (co…</span>

                    <span>I have always wanted to write a completely hackable text editor which can be changed on the fly. I feel Emacs is the best when it comes to that.
 While I may start someday, what would be a good language to write it in? In my limited knowledge, the language should have the following properties:
  
It should be interpreted, not compiled
 It should have fast execution speed
 It should have good GUI-building capabilities
 It should be backward compatible
  
While many may suggest python, would that be good enough? I&#x27;ve heard it has slow execution speed and is not af all backward compatible. I could be wrong.
 Also, I believe the first step to writing such an editor would be writing an interpreter for the language in C/C++ and then writing the editor in that interpreted language? Isn&#x27;t that how Emacs is written?
 I would really like your inputs. I know the question is really broad but I guessed Emacs veterans on this sub would be best qualified to answer my questions. BTW what do you guys think of TCL/TK?

                    <span>i am working on C++ source that uses no indentation for C++ namespace. is there a way to add a comment in the file to tell emacs that at that particular line it should assume the indentation level to be at zero or to ignore specifically marked curly braces?
 i do not want to configure namespace indentation in general and i do not want to know how to do it (non-portable) with the help of lisp in my own configuration file.
 is there magic which can be added in comments to affect indentation on the fly?

                    <span>Hi,
 I have recently switched to emacs from vim and so far my experience has been pretty good (still trying to get used to elisp). One of the things which I had setup in my vimrc was a compilation command which would compile my code, I had heard that emacs had a command called &#x60;compile&#x60; and I tried to use that. I had noticed that when I did not have evil mode enabled the &#x60;compile&#x60; command would behave the way I had wanted and use the windows on the screen, however once I had turned on evil mode the compile command would not use the windows on the screen as I had wanted, I think that the best way to illustrate this would be through some images of it works with evil mode right now and how I want it to work:
 Whenever I have one window open and I run &#x60;compile build.bat&#x60; the compile command would make a new split and put the compilation buffer in there and this is fine:
 https://preview.redd.it/xqro9chktrt71.png?width&#x3D;1920&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;8e8849d1b3306b59a875758543201aab26c6f9d0
 However, the problem primarily arises when I try to compile my code on the second split, if I open a new file on the window with the compilation buffer open and run &#x60;compile build.bat&#x60; like before, evil mode will cause emacs to open a new window and run the code there, I want it to behave like it did without evil mode enabled and simpy switch to the other window in a split on the screen and run it there (I have drawn an arrow showing where I want to to open the compilation buffer which emacs did without evil mode enabled):

 Today yt recommends me a nvim tutorial with C++, and I realize that I did not config emacs for Unit test yet.
 Searching : Google and list-packages I did not found some similar. Yes you can run: ./build/bin/testname and runs.
 But If I want just to run a single test without comment the others?

 ... but is there a way to define a range based on a start date and a duration?

                    <span>Alright, I know this isn&#x27;t really a Haskell question per se (being about emulating a Haskell language feature in another language) -- but I figured posting here would give me the best probability of getting an answer.
 Some of you may know that profunctor optics have been spotted in an open-sourced part of the Minecraft code-base, among other things. 
 While this is neat, emulating profunctor optics in Java (though I haven&#x27;t looked at the actual encoding in the library) seems relatively straightforward to me: Java interfaces with generic methods can be used to encode rank N types, and a lightweight encoding of higher-kinded-types in langues with only first order generics is well-known.
 What I&#x27;m interested in with this library is the among other things. I noticed in the library documentation that (at least according to package naming scheme), this library also seems to have an encoding of type families in Java. This seems to be backed up by the fact that one of the linked papers in the readme of the project also uses type families. 
 This is more surprising to me. I know Java generics are Turing complete, but as far as I know, there are no academic results that would lead me to believe that type families can be emulated in Java (as I remember, the paper essentially uses an encoding of grammars as a kind of fluent interface in the proof of Turing completeness).
 Does anyone know anything about this seeming emulation of type families in Java? Has anyone tried to wrap their head around it, or know of any academic papers on how this works, or is this encoding a novel result applied just in this code-base , that has yet to be rigorously studied?

                    <span>I have experience programming in Swift and iOS development and I’ve recently started learning Haskell. I really like the language but I’m struggling to find good ways to put it to use to gain experience. What are some fun projects I can explore considering my programming background?

                    <span>Hi all
 I recently got a used copy of Programming in Scala 2nd edition. I realized now that it might be outdated.
 Should I try to find a newer edition or would this do ?
 How much of a difference is there between 2.8 and 3.* now?
 Im a complete beginner in Scala.

                    <span>I have created basic code to create objects and upload them to a etcd database. The code is :
 //case class Teacher(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int) case class Country(name: String, region: String, population: Int, area: Int, popDensity: Int, coastline: Int, netmigration: Int, infantMortality: Int, gdp: Int, literacy: Int, phones: Int, arable: Int, crops: Int, other: Int, climate: Int, birthrate: Int,deathrate: Int, agriculture: Int, industry: Int, service: Int) object HttpJsonPostTest extends App { // create our object as a json string val country &#x3D; new Country(&quot;Lucas&quot;, &quot;luc&quot;, 32) // ignore this, itds not part of what im currently trying to achive val countryAsJson &#x3D; new Gson().toJson(country) // add name value pairs to a post object val post &#x3D; new HttpPost(&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/big_data_course1&quot;) val nameValuePairs &#x3D; new ArrayList[NameValuePair]() nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(&quot;value&quot;, countryAsJson )) post.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(nameValuePairs)) // send the post request val client &#x3D; new DefaultHttpClient val response &#x3D; client.execute(post) println(&quot;--- HEADERS ---&quot;) response.getAllHeaders.foreach(arg &#x3D;&gt; println(arg)) } 
 But now im wondering how do i feed the object data from a CSV file, parse each data into the corresponding part like country etc ?
 And be able to view it in

                    <span>Hi!
 I wonder how to write parallel sum program in ZIO. More precisely I want to write a program which transforms a list of ints into its sum in parallel. 
 Best, Henry

 So i have this line which is called post_data.scala
 and a buildt.sbt file which contains :

 But when i load it in http i only get the value : 
 action &quot;get&quot; node key &quot;/big_data&quot; value &quot;Marius&quot; modifiedIndex 11 createdIndex 11 
 while others get lastname and age as well, but i cannot understand why i dont but they do. I followed the same instructions as they did. Does someone have an idea what went wrong ?

                    <span>Some of the following items are based on the digital version of Luhmann&#x27;s original paper zettelkasten at the Niklas-Luhmann-Archiv. Luhmann wrote in German, and I apologize for language barriers that may come up in the following.
What are your favourite single zettels (or zettel groups) from the archive?
porn movie (&quot;showing everything and nothing but that&quot;), the &quot;joker&quot; zettel, and in my probings I found one about the hypothetical &quot;Überbuben&quot; and and one about Luhmann sitting in front of his office drinking from an inkpot  - those are amusing, but perhaps not crucially relevant.


What are your favourite examples of serendipity?


On a similar note - it is often said that a zettelkasten and its author should surprise each other.


The English Wikipedia page on Luhmann says &quot;Luhmann himself described his theory as &quot;labyrinthine&quot; or &quot;non-linear&quot; and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood &quot;too quickly&quot;, which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings.&quot;</span>

                    <span>I am quite new to ZK method but I thought I understand the basic types of zettels, e.g. literature notes. While watching a workflow video about ZK I saw literature notes that make me wonder that I did not understand it yet.
This is how I do it
When reading a text and &quot;marking important&quot; parts I make a zettel of each part. Here are two examples from the same book but different:
# Shape of the world

The world is a ball.

Source: Bob (1876). The world. p.47

A second one.
# Alternative Shape of the world

Others think the world is a cube.

Source: Bob (1876). The world. p.419

You see: Two informations from two pages of the same book. This is how I would do this.
But in the video I saw two other interesting approaches. I would like to know how do you do this.
Alternative approach A
Approach one is to separate the source itself as zettel.
# Book: Bob 1876 The world

Full Reference:
Bob (1876). The world

Then the two informations
# Shape of the world

The world is a ball.

[link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.47

A second one.
# Alternative Shape of the world

Others think the world is a cube.

[link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.419

Alternative approach B
This is the other way around. The bibliographic zettel also holds the TOC of the book and link to the informations zettel form there.
   # Book: Bob 1876 The world

   Full Reference:
   Bob (1876). The world

   TOC
   1. Introduction
   2. Chapter X
   [link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.47

   3. Chapter A
   3.5. sub
   [link to &quot;Book: Bob 1876 The world&quot;] p.419

And the other two zettel.</span>

                    <span>I wrote a Python script that visualizes Org-mode headings using the &quot;xdu&quot; tool: https://karl-voit.at/2017/03/27/org-du/
 This comes in handy in my daily work with Org-moe files.

                    <span>Internationally, mobile domination has, and will continue to be, a rising phenomenon; In certain areas , this is especially true because of affordability and convenience. How will emacs adapt to this? I know there are some great apps working to bring some of emacs most used features to mobile devices, is this the solution? Is this enough?

                    <span>Not sure what one would call this; &quot;related buffers&quot; is a bit weird. Here&#x27;s an example, maybe you can help figuring out the term?
  
Visit a couple of files in a project folder (e.g. root has a .git/)
 Visit a couple channels on IRC via erc for team chat with colleagues
 Open 2 emails from your boss for reference
  
I usually navigate around by C-x b and filtering from there; sorted by recency, it makes switching back and forth simple.
 But let&#x27;s say I have a potato computer and usually only 1 frame with 1 window open at a time or whatever, so the default is I look at 1 buffer. When I&#x27;m in IRC, I want to switch to other IRC buffers easily -- look at other channels, direct messages, whatever. Focus on these, don&#x27;t show any other buffer in the suggestions.
 When I&#x27;ve switched to the project code, let&#x27;s say I want to focus on other project buffers. (project.el and projectile do this already)
 Same with email: When I&#x27;m reading mail, show another mail buffer plz. Don&#x27;t show me the IRC buffers or code.
  
I bet this has a name and tons of implementations, but I cannot figure this out. Like the ibuffer groupings work, maybe, but for buffer switching, ignoring stuff that&#x27;s not in the current group.
 Any hints what to look for to narrow down the list of all buffers to &quot;related&quot; buffers?
 To write this myself, I&#x27;d filter (buffer-list) by condition(s), and pick a conditions based on context. E.g. if major mode is ERC, filter buffers by erc-mode:
 (require &#x27;seq) (seq-filter (lambda (buf) (let ((buffer-major-mode (with-current-buffer buf major-mode))) (eq buffer-major-mode #&#x27;erc-mode))) (buffer-list)) 
 Is that a thing already?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been doing all the searches I can, but unfortunately, nothing is helping me with this. I am attempting to get Emacs set up to my liking for a lot of things (Python, Org Mode, LaTeX), but I am running into a problem.
 You see, I keep running afoul of company-mode, in that it decides at the last minute to produce a list of words associated with what I&#x27;m typing, and then, when I press enter (for a completely unrelated reason), it accepts the first choice, despite the fact that I had already typed what I wanted.
 No biggie, I just need to unset  for &#x27;company-complete-selection, right? Maybe move it onto something a little less used, like M-.
 Except I have no idea how to do that. I don&#x27;t want to unset  globally, as I just want to remove the binding for company-mode, and since I use straight in my configs for installing and maintaining packages, I don&#x27;t want to edit the original source (since any updates will overwrite it).
 Is there a method to unset  for &#x27;company-complete-selection that I should be using?

                    <span>Hello there.
 Recently, a video about GopCaml-mode has been made and published on this subreddit. The package itself is pretty good, and it left me wondering: What is the state of structural editing in Emacs, right now?
 Obviously, we have packages like Paredit and Lispy, recently we got SymEx, but these are all for the Lisp family of languages, where syntactic redundancy is very high because of the homoiconicity.
 I wonder if things like LSP can get us some level of standardized structural editing constructs for a set of languages supported by it. That would be really cool.

                    <span>Is there a magit function to get a simple sate of a repository given its path? I just want the status to reflect if there are uncommitted changes and/or untracked files. 
 I can call a git process directly to get this info and not use magit at all, but I prefer to use existing functionality if it exists.

                    <span>My setup has been to launch Emacs as a daemon in a runit userland service and set $EDITOR to connect to it, with --fg-daemon&#x3D; in the former and --socket-name&#x3D; in the latter.
 On my new computer, however, this isn&#x27;t working - emacsclient always says it can&#x27;t connect to the socket name, killing all daemon instances except for one (without a socket name) isn&#x27;t connected to by emacsclient, and (all) variants of emacsclient -t -a &quot;&quot; (run twice to generate a daemon and then connect from a client) foreground themselves (?) and print the contents of *Messages* to stdout (???).
 My new computer is running Void (like the old); the big difference between my computer which works and the one which doesn&#x27;t is that the new one uses ZFS. That shouldn&#x27;t make a difference, though. Otherwise, init.org is the sole source of truth, and the only file copied - everything else was installed by way of tangling to init.el and running its straight.el-integrated use-package recipes.
 I&#x27;ve tried to find out what&#x27;s going wrong by way of Google, then IRC. I don&#x27;t know what to precisely search up and don&#x27;t have the time. Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on?

                    <span>I recently upgraded my emacs config to now use the master branch instead of version 28-ish, and obviously I’ve run into some troubles with my config in the process that are a little different. 
 Before, I was able to have all my packages loaded without using the (package-initialize) function. However now if I run my config like this, (without initializing) I just get an error saying it cannot load use-package, which I use instead of package.el for loading and such.

                    <span>I use Gnus for my email solution, using GetMail to pop my various email servers to local and then parse them into gnus/notmuch. Works like a dream. The trouble is synchronizing sent mail. The solution I&#x27;ve used for several years is to automatically hide a BCC on everything I write, which sends to a sent-mail inbox that each of my PCs gets. Trouble is, not all information is saved in such a case. In particular, any other BCCs I have on the message are lost. This is a problem for the times I need to do &quot;undisclosed&quot; recipients lists. The answer seems like FCC field, which I notice NotMuch attempts to add on its own on the occasions I have mistakenly tried to write something through a NotMuch route. Trouble is, the notmuch default is relative to wherever directory location I am when I invoked it. Also, I read in the docs that things are appended to said location as mbox, like my spools, which means I need to think about how I am parsing that FCC thing.
 Before I dig in to a solved problem, how is anyone else making the most of FCC? Where do you put it, how do you parse it, do you put it in version control, etc?

 So you could say I&#x27;m utilizing All of Notion&#x27;s features and really need them (especially tables, linked pages, images). Obviously Notion&#x27;s way buff\heavy, has bad security and isn&#x27;t keyboard optimized, so I wonder how close can emacs get to it.

So how is your note taking workflow and what do you do to make Emacs feel less 80s ( UI packages and general functionalities)?
 EDIT: I should have explained better, what I liked is things like tables, Notion tables are incredible, you can easily replace a sheet editor like Google Sheets with it, the layout is really modular, you can organize the text in whatever way you want. The embeding stuff are really cool too, like calendar inside the file. So what I meant by modern is a interface that lets you do more functional stuff, like the tables that are not only pretty, but so useful.

                    <span>Hi, after I added TLS to my servant server I seem to get &quot;data: end of file&quot; output to terminal randomly. I can neither find a sitution where it is printed consitently nor can I find where the actual library is printing. Im assuming the print comes from reading the cert. files, however this should only happen once on startup? The printing happens around once every 3 minutes or so, seemingly randomly. I&#x27;ve tried to look at the source in hackage but to no avail. Any suggestions on how I could track this down..?
 where I THINK the output is coming from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp-tls-3.3.2/docs/Network-Wai-Handler-WarpTLS.html

                    <span>I&#x27;m guessing that the main reason why most programming languages can&#x27;t enforce &#x27;lazy evaluation&#x27; is because of mutability.
 Regardless, as I&#x27;m learning and falling in love with Haskell&#x27;s inner workings, I&#x27;m struggling to thing of ways in which strict evaluation outperforms lazy evaluation (or examples where it is better to use strict evaluation compared to lazy evaluation).
 The only real thing I can think of is that Lazy evaluation requires more memory management than strict since you need to store &quot;potential computations&quot; that have yet to be done. But other than that I can&#x27;t think of more examples

                    <span>I feel that my Haskell program sometimes consumes so much memory that it goes beyond a reasonable amount and chokes up the system. 
 I can understand that I can add some option like +RTS -M8g or something to limit my memory usage to 8g, but I do not understand where to add this to my stack.yaml file.
 The relevant part of my stack file looks like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; executables: mnrl-exe: main: Main.hs source-dirs: app ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl
 tests: mnrl-test: main: Spec.hs source-dirs: test ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl
 benchmarks: mnrl-bench: main: Benchmark.hs source-dirs: benchmark ghc-options: - -threaded - -rtsopts - -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N - -O2 dependencies: - mnrl &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I usually use stack bench to run my benchmarks. What option should I add to my ghc-options?
 Also, what is the meaning of -with-rtsopts&#x3D;-N?

                    <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 I am slowly but surely learning some haskell. I am going through the book &quot;learnyouahaskell&quot; and try to write the code before it is shown. I am currently at a binary search tree example and I don&#x27;t understand the warning I get. Or lets say, I don&#x27;t know why I get that warning. I don&#x27;t think that these cases can even happen.
 The warning
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for &#x27;insertInBinaryTree&#x27;:
 Patterns not matched:
 (Node _ EmptyTree EmptyTree) _
 (Node _ EmptyTree ( Node _ _ _)) _
 (Node _ (Node _ _ _) EmptyTree) _
 (Node _ (Node _ _ _) (Node _ _ _)) _
 I mean lets take &quot;Node _ EmptyTree EmptyTree _&quot;. How am I supposed to know whether it will be in the leftTree or rightTree?
 ​
 What did I forget to specify/constrain? Or what am I missing?
 The code is here:

 thank you in advance!

                    <span>I know that there are much better/fancier approaches to dealing with parameters in generics (e.g., kind-generics, and the GenericN class in Csongor Kiss&#x27;s generic-lens). But I figured it would be fun to implement a (left-associated) version of Generic1 using Generic. It seems it&#x27;s been possible for just a few GHC versions now: it requires quantified constraints and data families with polykinded result along with a whole zoo of older GHC extensions. Here it is!
 Note: I definitely borrowed some marking ideas from Csongor, though I use them a bit differently.

                    <span>Say I have several org mode files. One org file includes some code blocks that are useful as a foundation for other projects. I want to use in other org files the code blocks in this foundemental file.
 For example, one implements a lot functions for modular arithmetic. Now he want to use it for implementing RSA, and Diffie-Hellman algorithms.
 How this could be archived?

 Thanks a lot in advance.

                    <span>Is there a preferred procedure for removing org roam heading node? Right now the only way I can think of is to remove the properties tag under the heading and to rebuild the org roam db.

                    <span>I have node project (type: module in package.json) and I use typescript lang server.
 want to make this work: import { scaleBand } from &quot;d3-scale&quot;; but can&#x27;t figure out how. require-ing it works fine.
 autocomplete and lsp-find-definition don&#x27;t work, with the latter giving this error
 helm-M-x-execute-command: Wrong type argument: (or eieio-object class), #s(xref-item #(&quot;export function scaleBand(&quot; 16 25 (face highlight)) #s(xref-file-location &quot;/Users/xxx/Library/Caches/typescript/4.2/node_modules/@types/d3-scale/index.d.ts&quot; 2517 16)), obj 
 edit: 
 eldoc works, no the symbol&#x27;s type is known to lsp. autocomplete is actually OK.
 however it&#x27;s not about import vs. require. The destructuring seems to cause the problem. Doing like bellow causes no errors, but still does not navigate to the definition inside the d3-scale module.
 import d3_scale from &quot;d3-scale&quot;; const { scaleBand } &#x3D; d3_scale;

 Is there some way to only start lsp sessions for active perspectives, or more generally, active buffers and pause/stop sessions when they &quot;go to the background&quot;?

                    <span>tl;dr; Do most people set their org-roam-directory to be the same as org-dictionary? And those that do not - why not?
 I have used pure org for my note taking &amp; TODOs so far. However I do think I would benefit from org-roam/zettelkasten for subset of what I need - keeping a personal knowledge base (debugging history, analyzing problems, keeping track of stuff that has a potentially longer-term benefit, more wishy-washy &quot;plans&quot;).
 What triggered this question was the fact that org-roam does not reuse org directory but has a separate variable for its roam directory. So I wondered if there was a reason to have org files that are not also roam files. One reason that came up was that the number of roam files can grow significantly and org-agenda would get slower and slower. So...
 My current setup idea is this:
  
I separate out org files from roam (or rather have roam files in a subdirectory of org directory)
 Use roam for knowledge-base, journal etc
 I generally won&#x27;t do TODOs etc in roam files, but instead have a TODOs/Schedules in ordinary org (and these files are going to be part of agenda files)
  
Basically - use org-roam for idea/note taking that might or might not be related to tasks but don&#x27;t actually mix tasks into the zettels. Zettels could be referenced/linked to from tasks if needed (i.e. if some information/knowledge could be useful to get the task done)
 I read through https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hg2m5s/zettelkastenorgroamorgbrain_is_crap/ as an example of discussion of problems/benefits (though I realize that&#x27;s for roam v1 and quite out of date I expect most problems to be the same currently).
 Does anyone use a similar split? How is it? What would I miss (I can imagine referencing agenda items from zettels might be useful etc). If you think I should just merge the two and use org-roam - how do you deal with agenda? Fixed set of agenda files (subset of roam files)?
 Hope the above makes sense...

 ![img](f75h0j1zzct71 &quot;(Left) SVG widget in Emacs buffer (Right) SVG image &quot;)
 Now you can use SVG widget in GNU Emacs. That is, use an SVG image or fragment as background for push-button widget in Emacs buffer. You can also specify the width and height of the widget for finer control. Generally speaking, you can use any type of image for this purpose. But SVG suits best because you can draw widget of any size without any distortion.

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m trying to develop flutter apps with emacs, I&#x27;ve tried lsp-mode + lsp-dart and it worked just fine... my only problem was that it was too slow, my emacs was very laggy (it might be the lsp server that is slow, but at least I could be able C-n C-p continually without lag while emacs waits for server response)... it had lots of features which probably contributed to this.
 I found dart-server which seems like it only requires dartanalyzer and not also dart language server, I tried it on a single test file and some features works. However, when I tried it with my flutter project it didn&#x27;t work although it booted up the dartanalyzer I&#x27;m wondering if dart-server still works or is a viable option for dart/flutter dev in emacs.
 Also, what&#x27;re your thoughts on eglot, does it stay out of my way until I request for features just like dart-server (e.g. C-c ? to give details about symbol under point, or M-/ for auto completions, rather than constant popups in miniframes and the echo area)
 This subreddit has been so helpful in my journey with emacs... thank you all
 EDIT:: sorry for wasting your time, after trying a few times, dart-server seems to work in the flutter project (also some things still aren&#x27;t working, like flycheck support and intelligent completion with M-/). However, I&#x27;m still curious about eglot... I&#x27;d like some of the lsp features, but mainly on-demand

                    <span>Hi
 I currently have a course at my uni where we need to rewrite default Haskell functions, and group was the first to get me a bit lost.
 However, I think I managed a way to do it with the knowledge I currently have, so let me know what you think of it!
 group :: Eq a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]
 group [p] &#x3D; [[p]]
 group (p:listtail) &#x3D; if p &#x3D;&#x3D; (head listtail) then (p:(head (group listtail))):(tail (group listtail)) else [p]:(group listtail)

                    <span>Problem
 So I&#x27;m writing an app that of course works on a lot of data. So far all of the data was kept in a running program, after it was initially loaded from files. Before closing the app the data should be saved into the same files again.
 This has problems: - huge memory usage, unsustainable - there can be exceptions on save, better to have the data be saved incrementally and not loose it all.
 Solution?
 I want to add some database (is there other solution?). In a nutshell I want a simple library, best if can use existing Aeson JSON encodings or can generate all the typeclasses automatically. Complicating matters - I may need to combine in one atomic block both database and STM transactions.
 Here in more detail:

                    <span>I am trying to implement some functions on graphs which are like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; module Graph.Algorithms where
 import Data.Set (Set) import qualified Data.Set as Set
 foldGraph :: Ord v &#x3D;&gt; (v -&gt; x -&gt; x) -- operation -&gt; x -- initial value -&gt; [v] -- initial states -&gt; (v -&gt; [v]) -- successors -&gt; x -- final value foldGraph op init inits succ &#x3D; go Set.empty inits where go _ [] &#x3D; init go sofar (v:vs) | Set.member v sofar &#x3D; go sofar vs | otherwise &#x3D; v op (go (Set.insert v sofar) ((succ v) ++ vs))
 collectGraph :: Ord v &#x3D;&gt; (v -&gt; [x]) -- result at each vertex -&gt; [v] -- initial vertices -&gt; (v -&gt; [v]) -- successors -&gt; [x] collectGraph forv &#x3D; foldGraph (\v x -&gt; forv v ++ x) []
 reachability :: Ord v &#x3D;&gt; [v] -- initial states -&gt; (v -&gt; [v]) -- successors -&gt; (v -&gt; Bool) -- final states -&gt; Bool reachability inits succ final &#x3D; foldGraph (\v x -&gt; final v || x) False inits succ &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is this the best way to implement these algorithms? I plan to use this on graphs whose vertices are something like (Maybe Int, Maybe Int, Bool).
 I feel that this implementation is taking way too long on bigger (but not so big) graphs. For example, consider
 reachability [1] (\x -&gt; [x + 1]) ( &#x3D;&#x3D; 100000000)
 When I run this on GHCi, it blows up (takes a huge amount of RAM). But a python implementation using python&#x27;s set returns like within 100 seconds or so.
 How can I improve on the performance of these algorithms?

                    <span>I have a situation where I want to run a Megaparsec parser on a string that is the result of another Megaparsec action (not a final parse result). As an example, suppose I want to apply my expression parser on the contents of a Haskell-style line comment block within a larger program:
 -- x + -- y + z 
 Since I don&#x27;t want my expression parser to worry about linebreaks being followed by --, the best approach I can come up with is to have a parser that extracts the contents of the line comment block, discards the -- prefixes, and then parses the resulting string. I can run the top-level parse function to essentially invoke a sub-parser, but this raises some questions:
  
How do I best propagate any parse errors to the top parser?
 How do I obtain the file name of the input?
 Is there another way to do this?
  
Instead of running an entirely new inner parser, I might also be able to play games with stateInput, but I&#x27;m not sure what the rules are for messing about with the state at that level.

                    <span>When programming in JS or PHP, given that their package managers (npm/composer) actually download the source under /node_modules/ or /vendor/ ... in most editors/IDEs, from your own project&#x27;s source code that references any packages, you can just ctrl-click something you imported from them, to navigate into the package&#x27;s source code.
 Is there some simple way to do this with Haskell?
 Or is it completely different given that it&#x27;s a compiled language? 
 I see can under ~/.cabal/store/ that it contains packages I&#x27;ve used in a project. But it looks to all be binary .hi files. Does the source code not even exist on my computer?
 If I want to navigate the package locally in my editor, obviously I can find it on github/etc and download a copy. But is that basically the only way to get a local copy of the source? Or is there something more efficient for packages that I&#x27;m already using in a project?
 I know you can browse on Hackage in your web browser, which is cool... but nowhere near as efficient as my normal editor where I do all my code navigating normally.
 I&#x27;m using vscode, and Cabal.

                    <span>The definition of Comonad looks like this:
 class Functor w &#x3D;&gt; Comonad w where extract :: w a -&gt; a duplicate :: w a -&gt; w (w a) extend :: (w a -&gt; b) -&gt; w a -&gt; w b {-# MINIMAL extract, (duplicate | extend) #-} 
 It seems to me in many instances you could simply define:
 duplicate wa &#x3D; fmap (\_ -&gt; wa) wa extend wab wa &#x3D; fmap (\_ -&gt; wab wa) wa 
 Is this true for all instances? If so, the class is a lot less interesting than it seems.

                    <span>You must use recursion to define ted and you must do so from “scratch”. That is, other than the cons operator, head, tail, and comparisons, you should not use any functions from the Haskell library.
 This is what I have so far
 ted :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] ted xs &#x3D; go (maximum xs) xs where go _ [] &#x3D; [] go m (x:xs) | m &#x3D;&#x3D; x &#x3D; go m xs | otherwise &#x3D; x : go m xs 
 The program is to satisfy all these conditions.

 Software:
 - OS: MacOS 11.6 - emacs: GNU Emacs 27.2 via brew - dot: dot - graphviz version 2.49.1 (20210923.0004) - pdftex: pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22 (TeX Live 2021) 
 The error I get is:
 Symbol’s function definition is void: org-babel-execute:dot 
 If I add to my initialization file
 (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;((dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t))) (require &#x27;cl) 
 I get:
 Symbol’s value as variable is void: params 
 Any Idea how to move forward? Im thinking the documentation is out of date or not for the versions I have :(

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone&#x27;s moved from org-mode to other note-taking systems, such as a personal wiki, or markdown in vim, or switched and switched back to org-mode. What caused you to switch? If you switched back, why?
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hey,
 I just took a job that was largely JVM-focused. I&#x27;m not new to the JVM; I&#x27;ve done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I&#x27;ll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I&#x27;d feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I&#x27;ve also been there and done that, and I like types now.
 Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We&#x27;re a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. 
 I&#x27;m looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I&#x27;m not opposed to pragmatism either; it&#x27;s one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there&#x27;s a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I decided to try out the dashboard package. Flukey, because I don&#x27;t much go in for gingerbread, but I&#x27;d seen it mentioned a couple times &amp; thought, &quot;Why not?&quot;
 Installed it, put some simple config in the init, restarted. Hmm. What did I do wrong? Restarted, it showed up this time. Well, it looked okay, nothing special. I clicked out of it into an org file. It took a minute to register. WTH? Buffer-face-mode was gone! I was in an org file with default Emacs faces. This is messed up. Let me restart again.
 Whoa. I&#x27;m getting a Flycheck error now, and faces are still wrong. Well, this doesn&#x27;t fly. I&#x27;ll comment out the dashboard stuff. WTH? The buffer&#x27;s read-only! I toggle read-only, modeline shows file is writable, yeah, no. Let me switch to a different buffer. WTH? C-x b doesn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;m flummoxed. I&#x27;m starting to hate on dashboard.
 Close the program. Start from a command line emacs -Q. That still works, anyway. Get to the init file, comment out the dashboard stuff, restart. Yeah, okay, great - I have my key bindings and my faces back. But, dashboard is the gift that keeps on giving. I still have the Flycheck error - 
 Wrong type argument: symbolp, (flycheck-mode-set-explicitly)
 Where did that come from? It wasn&#x27;t here yesterday. And hey, guess what? A recursive grep for flycheck-mode-set-explicitly through all the files in elpa comes up empty.
 $ ls -R */*.el | xargs grep &#x27;flycheck-mode-set-explicitly&#x27;
 It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.
 Actually, it does. I reluctantly decide to go to the Flycheck page and submit an issue, try to find out where this is coming from. Hahaha! Joke&#x27;s on me. They don&#x27;t handle issues from Windows. They dump them into a bucket and if someone comes along &amp; handles them, great. In the meantime...
 In the meantime, I switch to Flymake.
 Afterward, I listened to &quot;Not Just the Tudors&quot; podcasts for three hours to regain my equilibrium. God, I love Emacs.

                    <span>Using vim-surround, if you have the text
 you say hello world and i say it back ^ 
 ...with your cursor on the character the carat indicates, then enter ys2aw&quot;, you end up with the line
 you say &quot;hello world&quot; and i say it back 
 However, in Emacs, when evil-surround is enabled, if you take the same initial line and perform the same keystrokes, you instead end up with
 you say &quot;hello world &quot;and i say it back 
 Is this a known issue, or expected behavior in some way?
 I stripped down my init.el so that the only lines in it require and enable evil and evil-surround, so I can&#x27;t see how my configuration would be the problem. I wasn&#x27;t able to find any reference to any similar issues on the Github though, which is surprising to me if other people are experiencing it; it seems like a pretty common command to run.
 If anyone else can reproduce this behavior, let me know so I know I&#x27;m not crazy!
 Edit: 
 A different means of achieving the same effect as desired is referenced in this issue: #25
 Also, after reading TFM and understanding how the aw and iw motions work, I agree with /u/bugamn that evil-surround has the most consistent behavior; since I like homogeneity (I always enable evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol), I don&#x27;t really feel the need to raise an issue. If anyone else finds this irksome though, feel free to copy the text of this post to your heart&#x27;s content if you do want to raise one.

                    <span>Starting to take over maintenance on command-log-mode. Point your package manager to this repo, clm-toggle and done.
 https://github.com/positron-solutions/command-log-mode
 Using this package to stream is a little easier to read and especially more helpful if you were just casting keys. Command names make it very easy to figure out where to go hack. You can&#x27;t always C-h k when you&#x27;re dealing with the minibuffer or some weird modal package or using a command dispatcher like ivy or transient.
 Seeing the stream of function names is so helpful to get oriented faster. You might be questioning if the default org map overrides arrows (it does). Running with the log open quickly illuminates how your bindings and modes are all wired.
 Open issues or PR&#x27;s to add more commands! I was going to add a minibuffer toggle and a way to pause logging (to preserve the mode state while hiding and stopping logging). Out of time tonight but I&#x27;ll get around to anything nobody beats me to.
 The existing implementation was using global hooks instead of setting up hooks in the mode. It&#x27;s more on the road to being a well behaved package now.
 Not on Melpa yet since I probably need to file an issue to take over the recipe.

                    <span>Hey all.
 I&#x27;m having consistent, but intermittent, problems with functions not being defined in .elc files. Here&#x27;s an example.
  Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Autoloading file /Users/jabrahms/.emacs.d/elpa/lsp-ui-20210904.2037/lsp-ui.elc failed to define function lsp-ui&quot;) 
 This isn&#x27;t an lsp specific issue. It happens regularly with different files. My normal path is to delete the .elc files and restart, but it&#x27;s risen to the point of &quot;Ugh. This sucks.&quot; so I want to fix it.
 Any clues why this is happening and how to prevent it?
 One suggestion I found suggested that it was caused by shadows in my load path. When I do M-x list-load-path-shadows, it outputs this.. which seems fine?

 Any help appreciated.

                    <span>Hello, I have just recently installed emacs with doom, and was playing around with the config.el file because I didn&#x27;t like the default font. I found where to change the font, but for some reason whenever I do SPC-h-r-f to reload the font, I get an error: set-face-attribute: Font not available: #
 and the code to set the font is:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;JetBrains Mono NF&quot; :size 24)
 doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;Monospace&quot; :size 22))
 Could anyone please tell me how to fix this?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Recently started using helm with emacs. Am obviously hitting a lot of mistaken tabs. I get that there is a learning curve but things would go much smoother if I could easily exit out of the actions list that tab pulls up and go back to the query I was typing. Does there exist a shortcut to do that? Or is there a way to easily add one?

                    <span>Hi there, emacs NooB here (I&#x27;ve been using basic org-functionality for GTD for about a year)
 I am now using emacs more heavily for research at work (nice and fast). I have recovered from a permissions issue yesterday, but have now created myself new problems by trying to setup reveal.js to output some research via org-reveal.
 I&#x27;m on Ubuntu 20.04 via WSL 1, (Doom) emacs 27.1
 Following the instructions here I setup Org-reveal. 
 I now get a warning about magit-section. 
 Error in private config: config.el, (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory magit-section) 
 Doom doctor tells me the following, but I&#x27;m baffled.
 :~$ doom doctor The doctor will see you now... &gt; Checking your Emacs version... &gt; Checking for Emacs config conflicts... &gt; Checking for great Emacs features... &gt; Checking for private config conflicts... &gt; Checking for stale elc files... &gt; Checking Doom Emacs... x There was an unexpected error Message: File is missing Data: (file-missing . &quot;Cannot open load file&quot;) Backtrace: (require magit-section) (eval-buffer # nil &quot;/home/user/.emacs.d/.local/str (load-with-code-conversion &quot;/home/user/.emacs.d/.local/straight/build-27.

                    <span>Hi guys, My emacs has been quite slow (esp. with lsp-mode/lsp-dart), I&#x27;ve downloaded gccemacs to hoping for some performance gain... I noticed that it took around 129 secs to startup ((emacs-init-time))); I tried it again, and this time, it took around 5.7 secs so I think it was compiling the .el files on the first run. Next thing I did was to start the normal emacs build to compare; This took around 150 - 200 secs, but like 10-12 secs on subsequent launches. When I tried gccemacs again, It took just as long as the first time again.
 It seems that the .elc files are not fully compatible between the two and so they are recompiled... Is there anything I can do about this? I&#x27;d love to use the gccemacs, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be stable yet as I keep on getting comp warnings pop up in a Warnings buffer which is disturbing.
 I thought gccemacs would compile down to .eln while the normal emacs would compile to elc
 My gccemacs is v28.0.5 and normal emacs is like v27.2 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>I&#x27;m interested in the editing features brought by evil-mode and would like to integrate them into my workflow early in my learning of Emacs.
 I read the documentation and noctuid&#x27;s evil-guide and they are great but are more oriented towards vim users, the second one also being too technical for an emacs beginner (I&#x27;m not a programmer).
 The vim documentation is very interesting but I would love to find something like a beginner guide for evil-mode.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m considering getting into Emacs for knowledge management and note-taking using org-mode and org-roam and see how it compares to Obsidian.
 I have three questions:
  
How can I use Emacs on mobile and sync across all of my devices? I need cross-platform usability, especially since I plan to use it on both my iPhone and iPad. I&#x27;ve tried Beorg, but it seems like it&#x27;s only for task management.
 How can I integrate it with modern apps and services (e.g. Readwise)? This is something that Obsidian has, which I want to implement in Emacs if it&#x27;s possible.
 What does Emacs have over Obsidian? Has anyone here switched from Obsidian to Emacs?
  
Thanks.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I use Doom Emacs with Evil and the +everywhere flag. I read Wiki pages with eww and I would like jump to urls with the same visual approach as evilem-motion-*, i.e., where the candidates are prefixed by letters.
 Defining the motion
 I followed the definition of the evilem-motion-* motions to create a new one based on shr-next-link:
 (after! evil-easymotion (evilem-make-motion evilem-motion-shr-next-link #&#x27;shr-next-link :scope &#x27;line)) (map! :after eww :map eww-mode-map (:prefix &quot;g&quot; :n &quot;&quot; #&#x27;evilem-motion-shr-next-link)) 
 Which works as intended, but only highlight links in the current line while I wanted to highlight all the links in the window. This happend because I am using :scope &#x27;line.
 Defining the window scope
 I managed to understand what was the scope handled by evil-easymotion, i.e., everything recognised by the thing-at-point function. But I didn&#x27;t find any predefined thing matching the window. Thus, I have created a new one:
 (defun window-bounds-of-window-at-point () &quot;Return the start and end points of a window.&quot; (save-excursion (message &quot;%d-%d&quot; (window-start) (window-end)) (cons (window-start) (window-end)))) (put &#x27;window &#x27;bounds-of-thing-at-point &#x27;window-bounds-of-window-at-point) 
 And then I changed the scope of evilem-motion-shr-next-link from &#x27;line to &#x27;window.
 Problem
 Everything work well, except that (window-end) returns a different value when I run evilem-motion-shr-next-link via the eval prompt, i.e., pp-eval-expression, or via my keybinding.
 For instance, on (eww &quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IntegerAtPoint&quot;) with the cursor at the beginning, the debuging message in window-bounds-of-window-at-point returns:
  
1-870 via the keybinding
 
1-1531 via the eval prompt
 
 Questions
  
Does someone know why there is this difference between the two approaches to call the function?
 
Is there a simpler and more efficient solution to what I am doing?
 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: Fix the formatting

                    <span>I&#x27;m wondering if Emacs supports the ability to search certain tags, by increasing / decreasing order. I&#x27;m planning on using date/time tags as such:  when writing in the appropriate heading, in one document. Would it be possible to search all entries, such that they show up in ascending order? the tag  represents the date and time in the format , and I&#x27;d be putting a tag each time I write in the different headings/subheadings. I&#x27;d like to be able to scroll chronologically through the different entries, and as such it would be useful if I can perform this type of search.
 I&#x27;m currently using Swiper as my main method of searching, is it possible to perform this type of search in Swiper?
 Also, is there a problem with how I&#x27;m planning on keeping my entries separated by topic, and tagging them so that I&#x27;d be able to search them chronologically? How many lines can one document contain before it&#x27;s too much for Emacs to properly process?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to run this function described here https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/35683/11700
 I have an sql statement highlighted when running the command but the highlighted text gets replaced by 
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  ImportError: No module named sqlparse 
 I&#x27;ve tested sqlparse in my terminal by opening a Python 3.7 REPL and the example here https://pypi.org/project/sqlparse/ works fine. Any idea why my emacs process doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to find the package?
 For reference, I&#x27;m on macOS 11.6, spacemacs, and I open an emacs frame by typing emacs in my terminal.

                    <span>I arrange my orgmode notes as single files with lots of entries. This works great for me because emacs is more buffer-oriented than directory-oriented, so all the emacs search commands optimize for single-file approaches (eg search all headlines in my tech/blog file for the keyword of that Linux function I&#x27;ve forgotten how to use).
 The single problem I have is footnotes. From the documentation you have two options: inline or in a file-wide section. My footnotes are often too long to fit inline, so I can change the name of that section but CANNOT make a section-per-entry arrangement, which is what I really want. The way I have worked around this with my blog is to always have the entry I am publishing at the top of the file, so using org-footnote-new finds that entries footnote section first and inserts things where I want them to be. I&#x27;ve used this compromise successfully for quite some time, but it depends on the fact that you are not going to add footnotes to anything but the top entry.
 Now I am converting footnotes in a non-orgmode date made by someone else, and moving the elements to the top of the file is not an option. Does anyone know of a way of implementing an entry-by-entry footnote section (say, for every * entry, or every ** entry as the case may be) without moving the single entry to the top of the buffer? The goal is for each entry to have a working footnote section of its own, which works nicely with org-footnote-action.

                    <span>So I recently installed org-helm and org-roam and now whenever I open any old org file (not in my org-roam path for example) the file starts with everything expanded and even if I hit tab on the headlines they won&#x27;t collapse. Quite vexing and difficult to google-for. I mentioned those recent installs mainly because that&#x27;s the only thing I can think of, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that says that&#x27;s a side effect.
 EDIT: Okay I can Shift-Tab and collapse everything. But org-cycle seems to be something else.
 EDIT: Oh yeah I also upgraded emacs/org-mode, so I could use roam, so that may have something to do with it.

                    <span>We have many really great projects in Scala ecosystem, which must have taken great efforts to build.
 And it seems that most of us are actually using these projects. Then why are we so miserly about indicating our interest in projects.
 I can understand the low &quot;stars&quot; on following nice things as these not really highly relevant to Scala community.
  
 twitter / finagle 8,100  
  
 Angel-ML / angel 6,400  
  apache / zeppelin 5,400  
  gatling / gatling 5,300  
  polynote / polynote 4,200  
  intel-analytics / BigDL 3,800  
  microsoft / SynapseML 2,400  
  spotify / scio 2,200  
  almond-sh / almond 1,400  
 
 But what about the following, which have always been to focus of almost all conferences, talks, blogs and what not.
  
 milessabin / shapeless 3,200  
  
 zio / zio 3,000  
  circe / circe 2,200  
  http4s / http4s 2,100  
  typelevel / fs2 1,900  
  getquill / quill 1,900  
  tpolecat / doobie 1,900  
  optics-dev / Monocle 1,400  
  typelevel / cats-effect 1,300  
  scalameta / scalafmt 1,100  
 
 Are there really only 1,300 people who care about cats-effect ?
 Are there really only 1,100 people using scalafmt ?
 And I discovered just now that scalqa/scalqa has just 56 stars. yes, just 56!!
 Just why ? It&#x27;s really funny compared to other comminities where even poc projects get more than 5,000 stars.

                    <span>JVM primitive numerical types are limited to Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float and Double. For over two decades everyone was forced to use those primitives, whenever computational performance was important. Luckily, with Scala3 there is a choice.
 Let&#x27;s define an opaque type Price, which will have all the functionality of a Float, will be as fast as a Float, but will be distinct from a Float. We will need to import Scalqa.
 import scalqa.{*,given} type Price &#x3D; Price.TYPE.DEF object Price extends Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical[Price](&quot;Price&quot;): inline def apply(inline v: Float): Price &#x3D; v.toOpaque override def value_tag(v:Price) : String &#x3D; &quot;$&quot;+v.toFloat extension(inline x: Price) // Optional custom methods inline def isNotExpensive: Boolean &#x3D; x &lt; 100 object TYPE: opaque type DEF &lt;: Float.Opaque &#x3D; Float.Opaque 
 By extending Float.Opaque.Data.Numerical Price inherits numerical methods which match those for a Float primitive. Even better, all those methods are inlined, so when used, they will be reduced to primitive calls.
 Consider the following example:
  var price : Price &#x3D; Price(9.99f) var primitive: Float &#x3D; 5.99f price &#x3D; price * 2 primitive &#x3D; primitive * 2 
 when de-compiled to Java, it is clear: the Price is treated same as a Float:
  float price &#x3D; 9.99F; float primitive &#x3D; 5.99F; price *&#x3D; (float)2; primitive *&#x3D; (float)2; 
 We can use Price with the same ease as a primitive without any concern for impact on performance.
 On the other hand Price is distinct from a Float, so the following will fail.
  def discount(v: Price): Price &#x3D; v * 0.75f discount(5.99f) // Fails // Type Mismatch Error: // Found: (5.99f : Float) // Required: Price

                    <span>Hey Reddit, because of the decision my university made I am going to learn functional Scala instead of an other language. Unfortunately it&#x27;s really hard to motivate myself to learn that new language as I was learning rust-lang until now. What are the advantages of Scala especially compared to Rust-lang?
 Thanks for your replies!

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m completely new to Scala so I can have a bit of trouble knowing where to start with some things.

                    <span>Almost a million years ago, I was dealing with some sinister bugs inside the
data structures in linear-base and to stop the nightmares I decided to just
test the specification of the data structures themselves. I ended up using
something that I’ve been calling denotational homomorphic testing. In this
post, I’ll walk through how I ended up with this and why this is legitimately helpful.
Our Toy Example
Let’s consider a toy example which corresponds to one of the data structures I
was working with; see PR #263. How shall we test a specification of a simple Set
implementation shown below?
-- Constructors / Modifers
empty :: Set a
insert :: Keyed a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set a
delete :: Keyed a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set a
intersect :: Keyed a &#x3D;&gt; Set a -&gt; Set a -&gt; Set a
union :: Keyed a &#x3D;&gt; Set a -&gt; Set a…</span>

 * day 1 ** FINDME ** otherstuff * day 2 ** FINDME ** otherstuff * day 3 ** FINDME ** otherstuff 
 How may I view just the FINDME entries? I thought the answer would be sparse trees, but if so, I&#x27;m doing it wrong. How may I read just the FINDME without expanding otherstuff?

                    <span>I&#x27;m in one of those &quot;... but it worked yesterday&quot; situations.
 Seems like I suddenly don&#x27;t have permission to access / write to my home directory (a local directory on the c:drive). I&#x27;ve not changed my setup at all, save for writing to my /home/ folder from Windows (I created and saved an org file using Notepad)
 I&#x27;m using org-mode in DooM emacs to take notes for work (making this all the more frustrating) via remote access from WSL (Ubuntu) on a Win 10 machine.
 On startup I get a warning like:
 Warning (initialization): An error occured while loading &#x27;/home/user/.emacs.d/init.el&#x27;: Error in private config: config.el, (file-error Opening input file Permission denied /home/user/org_roam/A_RANDOM_ORG_FILE 
 There is a clue here as &quot;A_RANDOM_ORG_FILE&quot; was a file I was too lazy to use emacs for, so made in Notepad in Win10 and saved to my home/org_roam/ folder
 So:
 emacs --debug-init Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error &quot;Opening input file&quot; &quot;Permission denied&quot; ... 
 When I try to write the error buffer to a file (because WSL cut-paste baffles me), I get:
 /home/ write protected 
 So I&#x27;m here to ask: what? why? Given the generic-ness of the problem it&#x27;s hard to google.

                    <span>I&#x27;m having an issue where Python LSP tends to be extremely slow and crashy on auto-completion. I&#x27;ve done all of the optimisations recommended by lsp-doctor, am running native-comp, and have tried a number of servers including pyright and jedi. I&#x27;ve also tried using corfu instead of company, but unfortunately auto-completion freezes everything up quite dramatically. Has anyone else had and fixed this issue before?
 EDIT: It turns out I&#x27;d been overlooking the obvious - I had unknowingly set my workspace to be my entire home directory. I love a good six hour hunt only to find out that I&#x27;m a dunce.

 Does anyone know if there is a way to configure org-agenda to show the clock report at top instead?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a pretty interesting project right now and I&#x27;m having different results depending on the build tool used: with cabal, the test suite fails but it passes with stack.
 My guess is that there must be some dependency version difference. So far I tried to &quot;dump&quot; the dependencies used by cabal using cabal freeze, and stack ls dependencies when using stack. An issue that I found is that while cabal uses my system-wide GHC (8.8.4), stack uses the GHC version defined by the resolver (8.6.5). Then, different base versions result in very different dependencies versions.
 Nevertheless, the test suite passes if I build the project using stack test --system-ghc (it uses GHC 8.8.4). I&#x27;m not really sure what dependencies are being used in this case (GHC 8.8.4 base or stack resolver base?). Running stack ls dependencies --system-ghc results in an error.
 So, how can I figure out why I get different results when building with the same GHC but different build tools?

                    <span>Hello! You might remember me from two nearly identical posts over the past year, and now I&#x27;m back once again, because Chordify is looking for another Haskell developer! Last time we actually hired someone who found us through this subreddit, and it would be awesome to do that again.
 Chordify is a music platform that you can use to automatically detect the chords in any song you like. This way we help musicians to play all of their favourite music in an easy and intuitive way. You can try it at https://chordify.net
 Now, the backend for our website and apps, that are used by millions of people worldwide, is written in Haskell! We serve the user using primarily Servant, Persistent and Esqueleto. We also have a custom Redis caching layer and use an advanced Cloud Haskell setup to distribute our chord analysis computations.
 We are quickly becoming an autonomous workforce, meaning there is pretty much no hierarchy, and we are looking to expand our fast-growing team with a pro-active, independent and creative functional programmer to further improve Chordify. You&#x27;d get the opportunity to work with advanced type systems to power a website that serves millions.
 More information and a form to apply can be found at https://jobs.chordify.net. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, or reach out to me at [rik@chordify.net](mailto:rik@chordify.net).
 We strive for diversity in our team, and encourage people of all backgrounds and genders to apply.
 One more thing, this is explicitly NOT a remote job. We expect our new colleague to come work with us at our (new!) office in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

                    <span>Is there a nice way to create a secret URL in Servant ?
 What I mean, I need some maintenance tasks to be executed at a regular time.
 The easiest (and the more flexible) is to use a crontab which curl the URL where one piece of the URL is secret (ie generated when launching the server or in a config file). Is there a way to do that cleanly with Servant. By cleanly I mean a way which can assure that my route is protected like I will do with AuthProtect.

                    <span>I am pleased to announce the release of a new package, linear-generics, based on GHC.Generics and the venerable generic-deriving. The killer features:
  
Generic1 representations associate compositions the right way around, which is to say the left way around, meaning no more inefficient fmaps or pesky Functor constraints.
 
to, from, to1, and from1 are multiplicity polymorphic, so you can use them in all your fancy new linearly typed code.
 
 The package includes Template Haskell-based deriving, based closely on generic-deriving, which is the recommended way to write instances. There is also a limited, somewhat unsafe, and somewhat inefficient way using provided DerivingVia targets.
 Many thanks to Arnaud Spiwack and Ryan Scott for their valuable advice and assistance.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I have been making videos about how I use org-mode, and some of the features in scimax (an Emacs starterkit for scientists and engineers) I have written to help me use org-mode. Lately I have been focusing on writing. Next week I will start some videos on some updates and new features in org-ref.
 ​
 You can find the scimax playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PL0sMmOaE_gs3E0OjExoI7vlCAVygj6S4I

 I hope some of you find them helpful!

                    <span>I’ve just read about “radio targets” in the org mode manual (section 4.3 at the time of writing this), and I immediately thought of using them in my knowledge base (Zettelkasten-style).
 From what I understand though, radio targets only work in the same file. Currently my knowledge base spans a lot of small files. Assuming I concatenated them to one file, it would clock in at 5k lines (and constantly expanding). I am worried that this large org file would slow down emacs.
 Does anyone have experience with using radio targets in such a setup? Are my performance worries unfounded?

                    <span>I still fumble for the right way to use a timestamp.
 Right now, I want to automatically add a timestamp (time of capture) to an entry when I use org-capture. What&#x27;s the right way to do this? 
 Should I add an inactive timestamp right down below the heading? I was thinking of doing something like CAPTURED ON: [2021-10-02]. This is easy to do inside org-capture-templates. But then the first words can have special meanings (as in DEADLINE: ) which makes it look awkward.
 Or should I just add it as a custom property? If so, are timestamps completely legal inside the PROPERTIES drawer (and will they always be?). I&#x27;ve seen other people add a simple date without the brackets, but this won&#x27;t cut it for me cause I want to use the timestamp with org-sparse-tree.
 Or should I add it as a list entry to the LOGBOOK drawer? Accomplishing this with org-capture needs some extra hacking, but this seems like the most semantically correct option.
  
Is it just me, or is org-mode syntax quirky? I&#x27;m confused about something that seems like a very common use-case?

                    <span>How would I go about writing the definition of a typeclass that is constrained on a generic type, and uses the type it&#x27;s generic on. for example: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; trait Request[Output]
 @typeclass trait Endpoint[R &lt;: Request[out]] { def apply(req: R): out } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I know I could make the typeclass generic on 2 parameters or have a type member on the trait, but is there a way to make it only dependent on the Request type? The information about it&#x27;s Output type should always be deductible at compiletime.
 This would help with derivation above all things, since the derives clause doesn&#x27;t allow you to give it parameters or type parameters.

                    <span>Hello all. I am trying to create a website in HTML, and I would like to use Emacs org mode for that. The goal is to replicate this, https://html5up.net/dimension, in org mode. The index.html file looks something like this:
 
  
  
      
  
 Within the main body, you have stuff like 
...
, 
...
,.....etc. The head definition for css, title, language is easy. In my org mode, I do this:
 #+HTML_HEAD: Tab title for website #+HTML_HEAD:  #+HTML_HEAD:  #+HTML_HEAD: 
 #+HTML_HEAD: 
 
 Basically, copy the content between 
....
 in the #+HTML_HEAD. The ... is automatically create when you type stuff in the ... body of the document. That is fine too. The problem is the nested div, header, footer within body. 
 To simplify the problem, the snippet in the body has this form:
  ...some code here...  
 where X can be head if you do 
...
, and Y is the keyword you use in the document for class and id, e.g:
 
  
 
 How do I enter the above code in Org mode? Additionally, how do I nest them? What about the code in between them, use org-babel block?

                    <span>How do I check what functions emacs is evaluating when I type a given character?
 When I type the &#x27;&#x27; character. I might have set this at some point; I checked the pairs in my electric-pair-pairs variable, which doesn&#x27;t contain the &#x27;&#x60;, I see that characters are entered with the org-self-insert-command function, but this doesn&#x27;t tell me much about what settings I&#x27;m looking for.
 Bonus round, when I highlight a region and type &#x27;&quot;&#x27;, the region is wrapped in double-quotes. What variable do I customize to add other characters to do this behavior?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use sexp diary entries and they don&#x27;t show up marked in the calendar, or in the diary view for the respective days. I&#x27;ve included the line, copied straight from the manual %%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1948) Arthur&#x27;s %d%s birthday in my diary file. The standard entries show up, it doesn&#x27;t.
 I can&#x27;t find anything in the manual. I tried adding the following lines to my config (and getting rid of everything else in those hooks) to no avail:
 (add-hook &#x27;diary-list-entries-hook (lambda () (diary-list-sexp-entries original-date))) (add-hook &#x27;diary-mark-entries-hook &#x27;diary-mark-sexp-entries) 
 How does it work?!!!!!
 TIA.

 I completely rewritten it to support multi-translation engines, like bing/google/deepl/etc.
 It is asynchronous and easy to extend.
 If you are interested, you can try it

                    <span>So till now I&#x27;ve been using the src blocks for just Python and R, and since they&#x27;re normally repl anyway, emacs didn&#x27;t seem that much more helpful (outside of not having to copy-paste the code and results into documents).
 ​
 But now, as I&#x27;m playing with some C code I fell in love with emacs again. I literally just write the code, press C-c C-c, and get my results. No manually compiling or anything, and the errors automatically popup on a seperate screen for you to fix.

 On top of that, print statement output are automatically cleanly separated into a table based on commas (but appear normally if you choose :output results).
 ​
 This has been so helpful for my operating systems course, and wow I&#x27;m so happy I found emacs.
 ​
 Thanks for coming to my talk (I hope the tags C Programming and Org mode help future searchers)

                    <span>Any recomendation for Email under Windows? All what I could find depende on Linux-only external tools. Is there a pure Emacs Elisp based mail package in Emacs?

                    <span>Hi, I just upgraded to Emacs 27.2 on mac, and when I try &quot;goto-line&quot;, Emacs does not actually go to the intented line, but just displays &quot;Mark set&quot;. Even popping the mark from local buffer doesn&#x27;t take me there. Any ideas?

                    <span>Hi guys, emacs newbie here...
 I&#x27;m moving from package.el to straight.el and Ive been trying to install use-package with it; I keep on getting this error: straight--convert-recipe: Could not find package bind-key. Updating recipe repositories: (org-elpa melpa gnu-elpa-mirror el-get emacsmirror-mirror) with ‘straight-pull-recipe-repositories’ may fix this I ran emacs -q and only executed the minimum code I think is required to install use-package with straight.el but it still gives that same error:  (defvar bootstrap-version) (let ((bootstrap-file (expand-file-name &quot;straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (bootstrap-version 5)) (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el&quot; &#x27;silent &#x27;inhibit-cookies) (goto-char (point-max)) (eval-print-last-sexp))) (load bootstrap-file nil &#x27;nomessage)) (straight-use-package &#x27;use-package)  I know there is a bind-key.el file in the use-package repo, so if it is required by use-package, I don&#x27;t know why it can&#x27;t be found.
 I&#x27;ve already used straight.el to install god-mode and it works just fine, I&#x27;ve also used use-package with package.el and that too works just fine.
 Any help would be appreciated.
 PS I&#x27;m using Windows 10 64 bit, Emacs 27.2

                    <span>I find this feature incredibly useful. It&#x27;s not very well documented, at least the documentation doesn&#x27;t give it the attention I believe it deserves. As other nifty features of ivy it was introduced a few years ago in a post: https://oremacs.com/2016/06/27/ivy-push-view/. It has replaced many uses of winner-mode in my workflow. Essentially it saves a buffer inside the window layout it had at the moment of the &quot;snapshot&quot;, then you can choose to go back to buffer as per usual or inside any of the different layouts in which it was saved. All this from the plain old (ivy-)switch-buffer interface.

                    <span>A few weeks ago Tom Sydney Kerckhove (@kerckhove_ts) published an excellent writeup of a serious DoS vulnerability in aeson, a widely used Haskell JSON library. A new aeson release addresses the hash flooding issue, but you need more than a version bump to ensure your programs are protected. This post outlines how aeson addressed the vulnerability and what action you need to take.

                    <span>Trying to write a program that changes a string based on some conditions. Just have problems when it i want to replace a letter with 2 others(/ just add in a letter after the first) but only if the letter if followed by an specific other. I can get it to find the index och where its happening and replace both letters but i just want to change one. Is there a reasonable way of going about this?

                    <span>I am currently reading the red book to learn functional programming in Scala, and was looking for more resources. I found some other books, and was wondering if this is a good order to learn functional programming in Scala:
  
Functional Programming in Scala (The red book)
 Essential effects
 Practical Functional Programming in Scala
  
Or are there other books/order that you would suggest? I just want to learn pure functional programming in Scala (or as close to pure, but related concepts are welcome too).
 Is the book &quot;Zionomicon&quot; more inline with the red book than the two other books perhaps?

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently looking for master&#x27;s thesis projects. An idea of mine was to rewrite the mathematical kernels my company uses to run on the GPU. 
 Most of the Scala libraries I could find have not been updated since 2.9.x or only supported simple multiplications. Are there any OpenCL or CUDA leveraging libraries that work on 2.12.x?
 Or is it possible to call C++ code from the JVM?

                    <span>Most articles I read about functional programming all point out that it&#x27;s better to write concurrency program in a functional way. With functional programming, one can forget the mental burden to maintain the state of variables, make less mistakes, etc.
 But they don&#x27;t provide examples and I can&#x27;t get an intuitive view about this. Are their any books or blogs provide such an example between the imperative one and the functional one in terms of the concurrent programming? Thanks.

                    <span>Hi
My name is Neal, I&#x27;m in California and likely starting a new software engineering job soon.  I&#x27;ve been using a paper Bullet Journal (BuJo) for a few years. I like that it is offline and I can problem solve with it, since I spend so much time online, and recently I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to make my bullet journal more searchable and useful.  So I came across the Commonplace index, and Zettelkasten, both of which look promising.  I&#x27;ve made some few steps on implementing both in my bullet journal.  I&#x27;ll have new things to learn quickly in my new job so any advice on first steps, software engineering, working on paper, or anything related etc would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks
Neal</span>

                    <span>In the course of writing code, I may have (and be ok with) a myriad of warnings that invariably drown out errors that I really want to notice.
 Can I help flycheck only ever show me the highest rated level?
 IE if errors exist, don&#x27;t show warn/info. If no errors, but warnings exist, dont show info. I&#x27;d be ok with just the first too, if it&#x27;s a simpler solution.

                    <span>Am helping to test espanso v2 alpha, if I edit the config with emacs/client, save it, it should trigger espanso to reload the file - it doesn&#x27;t.
 Micro works as expected. Espanso v0.7.3 works as expected with emacs. Can anybody think of a reason why that I can share with Federico the dev?
 I also tried touching the config, that didn&#x27;t work either. He is looking at his code as I type so hopefully he will spot something, it is rust and I don&#x27;t know rust :smile:

                    <span>Until recently, my init.el basically just called org-babel-load-file on my literate configuration file. However, this led to slow startups and issues where the wrong version of Org was getting loaded; as such, I&#x27;m trying to move to tangling my config.org.
 As of now, I&#x27;m just setting :tangle yes :results silent as properties on my config.org as well as having a function on after-save-hook that checks if the file I just saved is my config, and if so, to tangle it to init.el.
 This doesn&#x27;t feel particularly &quot;tasteful&quot; though, since it means that if I want to make my config easily clonable, I either have to:
  
Commit both my init.el and config.org to github (which will essentially be the same file), or
 
Upon cloning my config to a new machine, flounder around in stock Emacs before tangling my config manually (with an out-of-date, built-in ob-tangle) and restarting, instead of everything working out of the box.
 
 So, I thought I&#x27;d ask /r/emacs: what do you consider the most &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;tasteful&quot; way of tangling a (single-file) literate config?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to help my friend set up her Emacs. She needs to calculate total time duration from some time data. Currently she uses an Excel sheet to log all start and end times of the events, and then calculate the total time of the events. 
 I think org-mode with timestamps can achieve the same thing. For example,
 * Event 1  * Event 2 CLOSED: [2021-10-11 Mon 5:00] SCHEDULED:  
 the total time is 3 hours. Is there any simple way to do the calculation? I&#x27;ve searched for this but it seems there is no built-in function for this. Thanks.

                    <span>Hi friends! I know that we could control the size of inline images displayed in org by setting org-image-actual-size to 500, or 50%, or &#x27;(500, 400, 300) or adding a #+attr_org: :width 50% :height 50%. But all these methods doesn&#x27;t work for remote inline images, i.e. I can&#x27;t control the image like this: [[https:example.com/image.png]].
 Here is an example:
 original
 show inline image in 20%, but the size of the first image is not changed
 ​
 show inline image in 5%
 So, anyone has any suggestions? How could we let org-mode resize the displayed remote inline images?

I am trying to get emacs to first check if the current projectile directory has a .venv directory, and if so then load that as the virtual environment using pyvenv workon. If no .vevn directory is detected then fallback to a default virtual environment i have set up.
 The code looks like this:

                    <span>I was reading through An Introduction to Emacs Lisp, and on the chapter about save-restriction, it&#x27;s mentioned that when using save-excursion and save-restriction one after the other, save-excursion should be used outermost. This advice is also present in the documentation for save-restriction. 
 While the book does give a one line explanation- &quot;if save-restriction is used before save-excursion, Emacs may fail to record the narrowing in the buffer it switches to&quot;, I don&#x27;t quite understand it.
 Can someone please explain this, preferably via an example where something goes wrong if I have save-restriction immediately followed by a save-excursion expression?

                    <span>Basically the title. A friend of mine started using doom emacs, and I like the keyboard centric style of emacs plus the ease of customization (unlike vim imo). 
 That alone got me curious but I am comfortable in vscode at the moment. So, is there something that makes you not leave emacs for vscode? I know that there is a very nice git plugin (magit?) But other than that I haven&#x27;t read anything else. Also I read that code completion and going to function definitions are not easy to do on emacs, which doesn&#x27;t seem right considering how popular it is.

                    <span>I am trying to add a hook that will re-generate the latex fragments when I modify the zoom level in the org buffer.
 Here is my function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview t) )) (add-hook &#x27;text-scale-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) 
 It only works partially. The zoom level is adjusted only in the org section the cursor is currently in.
 From the org-latex-preview function I read that two universal arguments C-u C-u would rebuild the latex fragments everywhere in the buffer:
  
With a C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, display image for all fragments in the buffer.
 With a C-u C-u C-u prefix argument ARG, clear image for all fragments in the buffer.
  
How do I translate C-u C-u to elisp so that my hooked function regenerates the latex fragments in whole buffer?
 I do not think this matters, but just in case, I am using doom emacs.
 EDIT: Solved! Found the solution in this archived thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/67y5kj/what_is_cu_cu_cu_command_in_code/
  
Plain universal-argument actually creates a prefix-argument of &#x27;(4), and multiplies the car of the list by four with each iteration. So try doing (org-cycle &#x27;(64)).
 You&#x27;ll need to look at the actual command&#x27;s source each time to decide what exactly the function is expecting. Check out the doc-string of interactive for more info.
  
So I just added &#x27;(16) as an argument of the org-latex-preview function:
 (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (let ((text-scale-factor (expt text-scale-mode-step text-scale-mode-amount))) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 1.75 text-scale-factor)) (org-latex-preview &#x27;(16)) )) (add-hook &#x27;text-scale-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;update-org-latex-fragments)

                    <span>The advice here does not work: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ShowParenMode
 If show-paren-mode is called anywhere then the show-paren-mode variable still set globally. If the variable is set then the parentheses do not highlight, so the mode isn&#x27;t active (I assume).
 With this code, show-paren-mode is set on initial load:
 (use-package prog-mode :ensure nil ; not really a package :hook ((prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode) (prog-mode . smartparens-mode) (prog-mode . local-show-paren-mode)) :config (defun local-show-paren-mode () (make-variable-buffer-local &#x27;show-paren-mode) (show-paren-mode 1))) 
 I also tried calling &#x60;(make-variable-buffer-local &#x27;show-paren-mode)&#x60; at top level. It&#x27;s still global even though inspecting the variable, it calls itself buffer-local.
 I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s actually still global because when I call M-x show-paren-mode and open another empty buffer, its state in the new buffer is the same as the old buffer. Going back to other buffers, the state likewise stays the same.

                    <span>I hope you&#x27;ll indulge me for an experiment I&#x27;m running at blog.tygr.info.
 I&#x27;ve built a docker image which asynchronously exports org files in the format requested. I started from this awesome example from emacs-web-server and added a file cache and pdf support. You can see it here: org-ssr
 As you might&#x27;ve already guessed, I&#x27;m going live with it. My blog is being served by emacs.
 That means if you ever have to wait a few seconds to see a page load, you are probably the first person to see that page in that format.
 It also means that with &#x60;url-handler-mode&#x60; enabled, you can browse to my site like &#x60;C-x C-f https://blog.tygr.info/index.org&#x60; to see the website in org mode.
 So now all pages on my blog are available as .html, .txt, .tex, or .org. As I mentioned, pdf is available but I don&#x27;t have texlive installed on my server, so it&#x27;ll just fail right now.
 And yes, I realize there&#x27;s no favicon. I don&#x27;t think there ever will be.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know what happened or what I upgraded, but now my M-x shell prompt looks like

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for a long time, but I&#x27;m not a programmer nor an expert. I just really like Emacs and org-mode. The hierarchical structure is not good enough for lists of data with multiple shared parts. I get lost in what is called a Wicked Problem [look it up on Wikipedia if you want] constantly almost always when I include another list, then I need to rearrange the contents of the lists for better comprehension and/or less clutter/repetitiveness.
 Hi, sorry if this seems simple to you, but I can&#x27;t get my head around this so far. I&#x27;ve heard of something called orgmode roam or orgmode brain, but it seems that I am just stuck and constantly looking up more search results while not comprehending much of what i find really.
 ​
 I&#x27;d like some real world examples of how would you solve this problem preferably with emacs/org software if possible

                    <span>I am trying to use org-cite in org mode 9.5. My emacs is emacs-mac 27.2 (aka Mitsuharu Yamamoto&#x27;s emacs mac port). I use ivy for completion, otherwise my emacs is pretty minimalistic.
 When I use org-cite-insert, I can see bib items in my minibuffer, and I can multi-select bib items with enter key. However, I do not know what key or keybind to press to actually insert the bib keys I have selected.
 My org-cite seems to be configured correctly, because if I just type by hand the citation [cite:@key], it fontifies alright. The only problem is, I do not know how to actually auto-insert such citations by org-cite-insert.
 I have consulted org manual, and also googled a lot, no solution so far. Any help on this?
 suggested solutions so far:
 -  :: doesn&#x27;t work

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I’m wondering if I should change my phone only because of orgmode app. I am currently using iOS and never found good org app. I heard android orgzly is perfect but never used it. I don’t use my smartphone for mamy things and my iPhone 7 is sufficient for my needs except that orgmode app. Is spending 800 dollars for new phone with android worth it? 
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>During my recent studies into effective learning methods, the phenomena that food plays a major role in cognitive performance has surfaced. Some research observed differences in cognitive performance between 15-20% based on nutrition intake (high cal/protein/fat vs low). From my own experience, if I&#x27;m hungry I get distracted more often and find it harder to enter the flow state of work.
In How Not to Die, the author points to research that observed consumption of burgers/meat lead to a very noticeable decline in cognitive performance minutes after consumption.
In his essay writing guide, Jordan Peterson recommends eating something high in fat and protein first thing in the morning before writing. He also talks about the importance of waking up early &amp; working in the morning. Peterson also said in another interview that he solved a clients anxiety problems by making her eat more. This suggests a link between not getting proper nutrition and anxiety.
The Netflix documentary &quot;The Game Changers&quot;, Connor McGregor puts part of the blame of his loss on eating too much steak - not having energy during the fight. This documentary argues vegetable-based diets are just as effective for building muscle as meat ones, as well as being more healthy for anyone interested.
I haven&#x27;t done much research into this question obviously 
My question(s) to you is: have you experimented with different foods and consumption schedules to boost your cognitive performance during knowledge work sessions? Do you know any interesting resources to continue this line of research?</span>

                    <span>Greetings,
 Began to migration to org 9.5 today and with it to try to adapt the new citations system. I have run into two questions that someone may have the answers to.
  
Trying to use any processor other than &#x27;basic&#x27; results in an error. For testing my configuration is very simple:
  
 (use-package org :demand t :pin gnu :config (setq org-cite-export-processors &#x27;((latex natbib) (t basic)))) 
 If I export to latex with this setup, it results in org-cite-store-export-processor: Unknown processor natbib error. Only basic works. The biblatex, natbib, and csl exporters all result in the same error. Is it really going to force me to perform a (require &#x27;oc-xxx) for each of them?
  
The styles seem a bit limited to me. Is there an option to provide a reference in place without a bibliography? One common use case is produce a list of publications in a chosen order (e.g., NSF-style CVs require &quot;Five relevant publications&quot;). With latex, this is commonly done with \nobibliography and \bibentry. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see support for either in the table provided in the very nice Introduction.
  
Is it possible to not insert a bibliography? It would make sense that if citations are used and exported to latex without the #+print_bibliography directive that it automatically inserts \nobibliography.
 For inserting references rather than citations, is there a style I am missing? It might make sense to have an r style that inserts the full reference in place (if exporting to latex, it would use \bibentry while basic would simply insert the reference text).
 Anyhow, I appreciate hearing whether I am missing something on these issues.

                    <span>Not here to start a war on vim vs emacs bindings. I am just more used to C-n to go down vs j. I really like the look and style of ranger and was wondering if there are packages similar to it but with emacs navigation bindings.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use file links in an org mode document to collect my latex pdfs. When I left click on the link, it opens the file in Atril Document viewer, despite my default pdf viewing application being zathura (zathura is opened by default when I open any pdf from a file manager). I decided to use openwith to try to force pdfs to open in zathura so I added 
 (require &#x27;openwith) (openwith-mode t) (setq openwith-associations &#x27;((&quot;\\.pdf\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;zathura&quot; (file)))) 
 As seen from this emacs stack exchange question
 as well as installing it on packages.el.
 Reloads without issue.
 When I open the file in the console section it tells me &quot;Running atril [path-to-file]...done&quot;.
 I am an emacs beginner so I don&#x27;t really know where to go with this.

                    <span>I&#x27;m an evil user, so &quot;C-k&quot; normally does evil-insert-digraph while in insert mode; however, company helpfully redefines it as company-select-previous-or-abort in its active map.
 Sometimes though, when I&#x27;m navigating to previous company completions, the &quot;C-k&quot; keypress will &quot;fall through&quot; and register as the evil digraph command instead of the company one, which drops me out of the completion I was in the middle of. I&#x27;ve only been able to reproduce this in go-mode while lsp-mode is on; I thought it might be a performance issue as a result of spamming the keypress too fast (I&#x27;m on a fairly weak VM), but I&#x27;ve occasionally been able to recreate it even when I&#x27;m leaving a solid 1 sec pause between &quot;C-k&quot; presses. Anyone got any idea how to debug this? It happens relatively frequently, but really inconsistently, so I&#x27;m having trouble reproducing it on command.

                    <span>Hey everyone, I was talking with a friend about the great text editor and when I talked about packages maintained by &quot;volunteers&quot;, he answered &quot;that&#x27;s awful! What happens if the authors of the package get tired and abandon it? You could have a package that is a whole part of you work flow die ! This seems risky because you have no certitude if the packages come from random people.&quot;
 And I couldn&#x27;t answer because I don&#x27;t know if its common that a package is left to death by its authors, but my intuition was that other people would fork it and still contribute to it or just maintain it... any answer? I didn&#x27;t say much to my friend because I don&#x27;t really know and didn&#x27;t want to say some dumb stuff.
 Thank you for reading!

                    <span>Hello,
 I’m trying to setup gpg encryption for my files in emacs.
 I’ve got the encryption working, and figured out how to get agenda items from said files into the agenda.
 My only issue is that I can’t seem to get full text search working.
 I’ve tried using the grep commands in Doom but they don’t seem to decrypt the files?
 The specific feature I’m trying to get working is Doom’s SPC n s which seems to be a function that calls ivy’s search for symbol at point?

                    <span>A really helpful tool for maximizing keyboard efficiency QMK&#x27;s layer feature, which allows you to hold down one key, and have different functionality for the other keys. Any key can be a layer.
 I was thinking that combining this functionality with something like ryo-modal could make for a very satisfying and efficient modal keybind system. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s any ready made way to do this in Emacs. 
 I think that the closest preexisting thing is Hydras, which basically are layers, except you have to define a keybind that exits the Hydra. 
 So the question is, how can I make the exit function for a Hydra be the releasing of its prefix key? I&#x27;m not sure if this is a simple or complicated elisp task, as I&#x27;m still pretty novice when it comes to Emacs hacking. Any help or insight would be appreciated!

                    <span>So, suppose I name a variable t &#x3D; 0/0. If I only operate 0/0 in GHCi the result is NaN.
 Then I ask Haskell to tell me if t &#x3D;&#x3D; read &quot;NaN&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t work. The results is False.
 Then I proceed to ask Haskell if t &#x3D;&#x3D; 0/0. The result is False.
 What I need to compare t to, so I can get a True value from these comparisons?
 ​
 Obs: I know I could do a &#x3D; 0; b &#x3D; 0. So t &#x3D; a/b. So if b &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 it would return True, then t is indetermined. But I want to directly envolve t in the boolean expressions. 
 ​
 Thanks to anyone who answers.

 I have found this project https://github.com/ScalablyTyped/SlinkyTyped/blob/master/c/cypress/src/main/scala/typingsSlinky/cypress/package.scala
 Exist it other cypress wrapper library in Scala?

                    <span>I&#x27;m reading (studying) the book &quot;Scala with Cats&quot;. In the chapters on Functors, it includes a section on covariant functors.
 The book describes contravariant functors as &quot;the ability to prepend a transformation to a context&quot;. What is meant by a &quot;context&quot;? All the examples show how, under certain circumstances, you can derive a type-class instance F[A] from F[B] if you have a function A &#x3D;&gt; B. Unlike contravariant functors, covariant functors seem not operate on type-class instances, but on concrete data-types. Are covariant and contravariant functors in two distincly different categories? I &quot;understand&quot; covariant functors. How can I gain a better intuition of what a contravariant functor is?

                    <span>Hello fellow zettelnauts,
I use the ##tag method from Sasha to signify a root link or parent link attached to a note. When I search for ## I also get all the H2 sections.
##links to @#links, is there a way to have a saved search with a joker like to catch every terms beginning with @# like @#$ or @#catchall?
To organize myself I use ttt to signify a note as a terrain in french, meaning field, for me they work not like hubs. And I have the feeling I would appreciate to have a saved search with ttt AND my root tags to get an idea of where my energy is going.
Thank you</span>

                    <span>What&#x27;s the trick to getting my compose key to work in Emacs under Wayland?
 In X/Gnome I configure things so that
  [I] ➜ dconf read /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options [&#x27;compose:ralt&#x27;] 
 and that works in all programs it seems, including Emacs.
 Under Wayland, with Wayfire have
  [I] ➜ grep compose .config/wayfire.ini xkb_options &#x3D; compose:ralt 
 which works in all apps I&#x27;ve tried, except Emacs!
 In Emacs I&#x27;m told that  is undefined. All the instructions I&#x27;ve found tell me to add the file ~/.XCompose with the contents
  include &quot;%L&quot; 
 but that doesn&#x27;t have any effect at all. So, what do I do? What&#x27;s the trick?

                    <span>Org mode can be used as a Calendar where specific dates pop up on the screen? And notice stays on screen until you close it. Or you can&#x27;t use org mode as a calendar?
 What things without login give notifications of exact dates that stays on the screen until you close the alert?

                    <span>I recently switched from package.el to straight.el, and was surprised by how smooth the transition was - everything worked out of the box and the changes to my config were super minimal.
 However, a couple days and a couple modifications to my config later, I noticed that org-related things were breaking. Checking load-history showed that nearly all the org.*.elc files that were getting loaded were from the built-in version of Org instead of the one cloned by straight. 
 Maybe I was just hallucinating that it was ever working: at least if that&#x27;s the case, it provides a way for my best present theory to be true, which is that the built-in Org is getting loaded as a side-effect of me having a literate configuration. I printed the load-path variable at the beginning of my init.el file (which is basically just (org-babel-load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;)), and the straight version of Org wasn&#x27;t on the path yet. This has me thinking that when Emacs hits &quot;org-babel-load-file&quot; it loads the only version of Org available on the path - i.e. the built-in version.
 If so, what&#x27;s the fix? Does keeping a literate config force you to do some ugly workarounds with setting the load-path manually prior to running &quot;org-babel-load-file&quot; or pinning what version of a package you use through straight, or is there some cleaner option I don&#x27;t know of? It seems like Emacs should be able to reload a package to a newer version during runtime once the new source becomes available.

                    <span>Everytime I restart emacs, I have to manually run deft-find-file and org-roam-find-node before my keybindings are able to pull up all the files. If I don&#x27;t do that, deft and roam both show that no files are popping up. 
 I think this is an issue with my use-package config, where the packages are loading on demand instead of by default. Can anyone help with this?

                    <span>Most languages that I work with, I use a code formatter. It takes away a lot of the cognitive load with me having to worry about the code looking good.
 For elisp, I have been using srefactor for a long time, but it has quite a few issues have not been update in 5 years. Most other formatters for elisp/lisp that I have seen has some subtle issues or just does not handle splitting of long lines. People also have suggested just using aggressive-indent-mode and then putting the line breaks manually, but I was hoping to avoid having to decide where/when to split long lines as well.
 Do anyone else use a formatter, any recommendations on a good one?

                    <span>Note: Although the following example is for org-roam-capture-templates, it works in the same way as org-capture-template.
 How can I change the org-capture templates to insert the file name of the current buffer I&#x27;m visiting and format it with a string? create a new file with a name based on the file I&#x27;m currently visiting?
 Example: I&#x27;m visiting a file called book_notes_some_title.org and I want org-capture to create a new file called book_notes_some_title_anki.org.
 The following example doesn&#x27;t work because it will only call the function once - when I evaluate the variable. I need to make it call a function every time I create the template.
 The function simply return the current buffer&#x27;s file-name (through org-roam) and appends _anki.org to the name.
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates &#x60;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head ,(format &quot;%s_anki.org&quot; (file-name-nondirectory (file-name-sans-extension (org-roam-node-file (org-roam-node-at-point))))) &quot;#+title: ${title}\nDescription: &quot;) :unnarrowed t))) 
 Edit: My explanation was wrong.

                    <span>Some time ago a proposal for better records was accepted and implemented:
 https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282
 https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst
 This looked very exciting, and would simplify many things related to record access.
 For example:
 data Person &#x3D; Person { name :: String, age :: Int} getAge :: Person -&gt; Int getAge p &#x3D; p.age 
 This is a standard feature in many languages, not having it may have throw off many beginners looking into Haskell.
 Do you know what is the status? Is it available already?

                    <span>I am trying to link to a C++ library and get this weird error:
 : User-specified static library could not be loaded (/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/libgcc.a) Loading static libraries is not supported in this configuration. 
 I use stack with LTS-18.12 and in the cabal file there is:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 The cabal settings are:
 extra-libraries: stdc++ gcc dl z pthread 
 and the ghc options are:
 ghc-options: -O0 -g2 -Wall -Wcompat -Widentities -Wincomplete-record-updates -Wincomplete-uni-patterns -Wredundant-constraints -Wpartial-fields -funbox-strict-fields -threaded -rtsopts 
 This is especially weird, as the exact same settings with the exact same stack LTS are in use in another project and there it works without the error. 
 I am a bit lost about what is happening/where to look at. Does somebody have an idea?

                    <span>Basically I&#x27;m in 3 weeks into my cs degree and have no clue what is going on. We&#x27;re using haskell in our &quot;Introduction to Computation&quot; module. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m incapable of understanding the concepts but everything just moves very fast and I&#x27;m left trying to cram and eventually understanding very little of what&#x27;s going on.
 Maybe this is the wrong place to ask, but how do I efficiently catch up and grasp the concepts so I&#x27;m able to solve basic problems using things like list comprehension and recursion? My grade depends on this because it&#x27;s based on the coursework we submit each week.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated :)

 https://reanimate.github.io/
 It looks great to create video animations, such as in the Youtube channel 3Blue1Brown (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to the Haskell world and recently discovered The Monad.Reader, which is so enjoyable to read.
 Unfortunately, there seems to be no updates since 2015 [1], yet there&#x27;s no official announcement of shutdown. What happened? Is there any hope TMR can continue?

                    <span>Hi Everyone, I am an organizer of a similar data science community like yours. We are involved in &quot;AI for Earth Monitoring&quot; project. It&#x27;s a cool online course created by experts who teach Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using imagery datasets from Sentinel satellites. It starts online on October 18th, 2021. It’s a completely free course. We have about 2k registrations so far but would be happy to see folks from other communities foster exchange between us.

                    <span>Hello, fellow Zettlers!
Being fresh to both Zettelkasten method and this forum, I have to first and foremost ask for your forgiveness if this was already discussed or perhaps it is stupidly obvious, but I struggled to find any threads relating to the following conundrum: how to deal with fields of knowledge or areas of practice, which are subject to significant changes in relatively short time frames?
Example: I am a lawyer based in an EU member state, practicing in a global industry dealing with several fields of law (e.g. intellectual property or privacy law) which are subject to quite dynamic changes (due to legislative actions on EU and state level, ever growing case law, technological changes, etc.). Of course, some concepts fundamental to jurisprudence or terminology specific to a given field may stay relevant for some time. However, due to this high variability, when taking notes regarding more practical and recent issues I face the problem of dealing with &quot;volatile&quot; notes, which feel like they may unexpectedly, suddenly, in any moment become irrelevant, useless or even harmful (e.g. by severing an existing train of thought with a statement which is not true any more).
Maybe this is my lack of understanding, but I feel there is a meaningful difference between evolution of sciences (regardless of its pace), where old models or theories give way to new ones, which explain given real phenomena better, or where new evidence provide a fresh look on the reality; 
legal &quot;reality&quot; may change in an instant, rendering prior statements describing this &quot;reality&quot; not so much obsolete or outdated as simply not true any more (or true exclusively within a bound time frame).
Are there any good practices or strategies helping to deal with such volatility of notes and tending the Zettelkasten without getting crazy?</span>

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;d like to run plantuml source blocks against a locally started plantuml server.
 I start the server with:
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty 
 and I have put 
  (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org (org-babel-do-load-languages &#x27;org-babel-load-languages &#x27;( (dot . t) (emacs-lisp . t) (plantuml . t) (python . t) (shell . t) (sql . t) ) ) (require &#x27;ob-plantuml) 
 in init.el but when I try to run the below source block with C-c C-c
  #+begin_src plantuml :file output.png @startuml &#x27; this is a comment Alice -&gt; Bob: Authentication Request Bob --&gt; Alice: Authentication Response John --&gt; Alice: another Authentication Request Alice --&gt; John: another Authentication Response @enduml #+end_src 
 I get &#x27;org-plantuml-jar-path&#x27; is not set.
 What am I doing wrong? Can someone tell me how to get this running?

  (use-package counsel :init (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t) :config (ivy-mode 1) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-s&quot;) &#x27;swiper-isearch)) 
 it seems that I have properly instrumented versions of find-file, M-x, describe-function/variable, etc. But the bindings still refer to the original functions, not the counsel flavored ones, e.g.:
  C-x C-f runs the command find-file (found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘files.el’. 
 When explicitly calling the counsel- ones, I see little to no difference, for example some of them automatically prefix the search pattern with .
 How is ivy instrumenting builtin functions under the hood? What does counsel add in top of that? Is it worth rebinding everything as suggested in the manual? Why?
 Sorry for so many questions but I dislike copy&amp;pasting stuff to my init.el without a clear reason. Maybe someone experienced with ivy can help me (an ido old-timer).
 Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to be able to run tools such as checkdoc, package-lint, relint, bytecode-compile ... etc, from the command line, passing in multiple files.
 Are there any solutions for this?
  
I&#x27;ve got something basic working but would hold off making a release if there are better options out there.

                    <span>I used to have 3 monitors on my desk, but when I started working from home, I just had the 1 monitor, and for various reasons, I still only have the 1 and it&#x27;s unlikely to change.
 I used to have several small, single-purpose frames off on a second monitor, and one of them was for compilation output. It&#x27;s been 18 months with just one monitor, and I still haven&#x27;t found a solution that I like.
 Currently, I&#x27;ve got a child frame that pops up compilation output in the middle of my main frame. It hides itself if the compilation succeeds. I don&#x27;t really like this because there&#x27;s a lot of extra handling that I have to do, focus switching is weird (like if I&#x27;m in my web browser and click on the child frame, it&#x27;s in focus, but the main frame doesn&#x27;t come to the front. I have to click on a buffer in the parent frame), and it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with which-key, etc.
 I&#x27;ve tried some solutions where the buffer switches to the compilation output and the buffer hides itself afterwards, but those are honestly kinda janky. 
 So I&#x27;m on the verge of going back to a compilation frame--dedicated or not--but then the cues that compilation is still ongoing or has failed or succeeded might be hidden if I&#x27;m working on something else. (I used to try modifying the modeline in every active buffer, but that caused weird conflicts with doom modeline and other things that also wanted to play with the display.)
 There&#x27;s a tradeoff with everything; I&#x27;m not looking for a perfect solution, I&#x27;m just curious what other people do.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to get very good at emacs lisp, but I&#x27;m usually at a loss about what I can do when I want to practice Elisp. What I&#x27;ve been doing so far definitely hasn&#x27;t been working (implementing a function here or there, going through the EINTR and emacs list manual, looking up things online.)
 What&#x27;s worked well for my learning style is to have a &quot;question of the day&quot; programming challenge, where the poster posts their own implementation of a programming problem the next day.
 Does anyone know of something like this for elisp?
 Thanks

                    <span>Hello everyone, I am optimizing my agenda views using org-super agenda, which is great. I would like to group my TODO&#x27;s both by filename and by path hierarchy. I can group by filenamess using the :auto-category selector, or by path hierarchy using the :auto-outline-path selector, but I cannot figure out how to get both. 
 I would like to get something like this:
 File_1.org/Tasks/Coding File_1 : NEXT Write script File_1 : TODO Debug File_1.org/Tasks/Manuscript File_1: TODO Write draft File_2.org/Tasks/Coding File_2: NEXT Run simulations 
 So basically it would like to add the filename to the groups obtained by :auto-outline-path selector. u/github-alphapapa, is this possible?
 Many thanks!

                    <span>When I first started using emacs (only a few months ago) I played around with speedbar which would open in a narrow frame on top of whatever frame I was in. Now I&#x27;ve gone back to it and I find it is opening full screen in it&#x27;s own frame hiding the original frame.
 I&#x27;ve looked thru the manual and I see something about frame parameters but I don&#x27;t know enough to know what if anything I should change or if I should be looking elsewhere.
 Any help is appreciated.

                    <span>Is there a way to have a context-specific expansion, for example using dabbrev or yasnippets, or another package, where a particular text expands to a different (pre-defined) string depending on the file you are in, or better, a buffer-local variable?
 For example, in one file tagged “baywatch-forever”, “david” could expand to “David Hasselhoff,” and in a file tagged “are-we-the-baddies,” “david” would expand to “David Mitchell.”

 boxy-headlines (previously org-real-headlines) allows you to view and navigate any org file as a boxy diagram.
 org-real allows you to keep track of real things as org mode links.
 Both of these packages rely on the boxy.el layout framework to generate interactive and expandable box diagrams.
 The example above shows off some of the available customization options for each package, like flex-width, margin, and padding, as well as the ability to work well in a linux console.
 Enjoy!

                    <span>Hi, I just got to university and my programming teacher told me we would be using Haskell the whole semester. He didn&#x27;t really tell us how to set it up though. All I have used is C# in VS Community and in Unity scripts, so I&#x27;ve always had it simplified in the IDE.
 What I want to know is: how do I start writing/using Haskell code? What is GHC/GHCup/Chocolatey? It seemed to me that GHC is something like a &quot;plugin&quot; required by the machine to run Haskell code, but I&#x27;m not sure of that, and I don&#x27;t even have a guess for what the other terms mean (GHCup/Chocolatey)
 I also tried installing VSCode with a Haskell extension and it seemed to be the most simple solution, but I would like opinions on that: what is best/easier? VSCode or using the PowerShell/CMD with &quot;manual&quot; writing on something like Sublime?
 If the manual way is best, can anyone explain how I install/set up Haskell/GHC on my PC? And how would I run code? If I have a function/method written on a file, what would I do if I wanted to use it? 
 Thanks a lot

                    <span>Do you guys use FFI to bind your own C/C++ functions in Haskell so that you can use in your own code?
 I&#x27;m not talking about Haskage FFI binding libraries.
 Can you shed some light on it how you do that?
 It is hard or reasonable easy?
 There some FFI examples online, but those examples are just baby example.

                    <span>I am a developer who works with a ticketing system. I get assigned tickets, they contain details, I complete the tickets, and move on to the next task. I would like to incorporate org mode into my workflow but I&#x27;m not sure how. Here is what I&#x27;d like to do, perhaps someone can tell me the best way to accomplish that.
 I want to be able to create a TODO for each ticket that I am assigned. I want to be able to keep notes on that ticket as well as have a check list of things to do. To include such items as:
  
investigate bug
 create a pull request
 verify with test team
  
Additionally I&#x27;d like to have custom states other than TODO and DONE. Something like TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE, VERIFYING, and BLOCKED. Finally I would like to be able to assign tags to different tickets so I can track them. So if tickets 1,2,&amp;3 all deal with the UI, then they get tagged with &quot;UI&quot;. If tickets 4 &amp; 5 are done on the backend with Java, I&#x27;d like to tag them as &quot;JAVA&quot; and &quot;BACKEND&quot;. Then I&#x27;d like to be able to filter based on my tags.
 What is the best way of doing this in org mode? Should I be making a new document for each ticket? Just have one really big document with all my tickets? Is there something about this that I&#x27;m missing? I&#x27;d appreciate any clues you guys could toss my way.

                    <span>Hi, i am searching for some library where it accepts some image and returns a collection of characters and their position in image (or obviously something in this direction)
 Would be nice if it could work with &quot;weird&quot; text as one can see in comics.
 I do see some java libraries for this, wonder what is the best one and if there is some scala wrap or alternative (but java is fine also if nothing else)
 thanks.

                    <span>Hello folks! My apologies if the title sounds vague, I&#x27;m looking for advice or project ideas to get an introduction to frameworks such as Play, Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I&#x27;m loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. 
 However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I&#x27;m not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. 
 May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I&#x27;d deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

                    <span>A bit of background information may be useful. I&#x27;m from Uruguay. I graduated from high school with an engineering degree, then requested inscription for the faculty of engineering.
However, I was a poor learner back then. Imagine short-term memorization on steroids. Effective short-term, not at all long-term. In other words, I remember nothing. Not even what an atom is.
I&#x27;m not sure if this is important, but I&#x27;m adding it in case it is.
I&#x27;m taking a gap year and now I&#x27;m working on choosing a career to pursue. I don&#x27;t have the research skills necessary to get anywhere with this, so I don&#x27;t know where to even begin. Also, at the same time, I can&#x27;t do research on how to do research. Thus, I&#x27;m double stuck, if that&#x27;s even possible.
I&#x27;ve tried looking on Google, Reddit, and Wikipedia. Didn&#x27;t help. Too much information, some of it not actionable, and I don&#x27;t even know which is trustworthy.
Any tips on how to get unstuck with this project? If research isn&#x27;t important to complete it, some advice or resources on research would be helpful too. Research skills are crucial for most of what I do.</span>

                    <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m trying to export org-protocol links so I can open stuff directly in emacs, but the ox-html export won&#x27;t even export the link.
 This is the code I&#x27;m using before processing:
 (defun my-open-in-emacs-link (backend) &quot;Add a link to use org-protocol to open a file in emacs.&quot; (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;\\(\\[\\[file:.*?\\]\\[.*\\]\\]\\)&quot; nil t) (message &quot;MATCHED: %s&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1)) (let* ((file-path (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;.*\\[\\[file:\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[.*&quot; &quot;\\1&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1))) (fixed-file-path (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;\\(.*?\\)\\(::.*\\)?&quot; &quot;\\1&quot; file-path))) (message &quot;FILE_PATH: %s&quot; fixed-file-path) (replace-match (format &quot;%s ([[org-protocol://open-file?file&#x3D;%s][open in Emacs]])&quot; (match-string-no-properties 1) fixed-file-path)))))) (add-hook &#x27;org-export-before-processing-hook &#x27;my-open-in-emacs-link) 
 So, before processing the org file, go through each link and make is look like [[link][name]] ([[protocol][open in Emacs]]. However the only thing that shows when exporting is name (). The protocol part won&#x27;t show up.
 How can I export the org-protocol link?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am working on adding more packages to NonGNU ELPA, the new package archive enabled by default from Emacs 28 onwards. Compared to GNU ELPA, there is no need for a copyright assignment (the only requirement is that packages do not endorse non-free software, but that is the case for most Emacs-related software to begin with).
 As can be seen here, I have already added contributed a number of popular packages and am waiting for a few packages to be fixed before they are added (I log the progress on these issues on my homepage).
 Going forward, I&#x27;d like to know what packages there would be an interest in adding to the archive? Note that a lot of popular packages are already on GNU ELPA, but I am specifically interested in the packages that are currently just available on MELPA or in no other package archive.
 (P.S. I am not interested in a flame-war on whether or not NonGNU ELPA makes sense or not. I just want to gather a list of popular packages.)

                    <span>You can redefine function in Elisp. 
 (defalias cursorWord &#x27;thing-at-point) (defalias let &#x27;setq) does not work? 
 ​
 Any idea how to redefine keyword like setq to let in Elisp?

                    <span>Under some circumstances - e.g. when using CPU-intensive plugins - emacs -nw can be seen flickering; fortunately, a lot of modern terminal emulators, such as Kitty, support a feature called synchronized updates which allows for what is essentially double-buffering.
 If you are bothered by flickering, this quick &amp; crude patch might help you:
 https://gist.github.com/Patryk27/c7b9dac8113f4ccdb2ef74e0083d9d41
 I&#x27;ve just created it a few minutes ago, but a quick test shows that the code works as intended; I&#x27;ll try using it for a few days and probably try upstreaming it - in a better, more configurable way, that is :-)

                    <span>From laptop keyboard it works as expected.
 When I use an external keyboard (MS Sculpt), the opt-somekey combinations are recognized as Greek/Special characters (π , © etc).
 If I load emacs without any packages (emacs -q) it works as expected.
 So it is some package loaded later doing this? 
 I had &#x27;Chord&#x27; enabled before. I removed it but it didn&#x27;t improve the situation.
 My Setup
  
Mac OS X Big Sur
 
Emacs28 with native compilation (Same issue with 27)
 
Recent Doom emacs config.
 
 I use Doom with several programming modes, orgmode etc. How do I narrow down which package is causing this?

                    <span>I use org to take notes for my classes, and make pretty good use of &gt;&gt; to make vocabulary terms and definitions get automatically linked-to from other parts of my notes (I use a file per class so I only need intra-file links).
 However upon exporting my notes to PDF to share with classmates (so they don&#x27;t have to ignore all the org markup and it looks pretty), the radio links don&#x27;t work. It does remove all the angle brackets, but no links. Ideally I&#x27;d like it to preserve that so people reading the pdf can click links to jump around in the (very long) file.
 Is this:
  
Something wrong on my config (maybe add some kind of #+ line to the file telling the exporter to include radio links? A variable in emacs?)
 Something wrong with my latex install (I have the full scheme of like 2GB of stuff, I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m missing something)
 A limitation of PDF (do PDFs even support file jump links? Interestingly exporting to ODT mostly preserves them - they work similar to how they do inside emacs, but then converting the ODT to pdf doesn&#x27;t work either, and I can&#x27;t leave it as ODT as they&#x27;re all normie MS Word users, and afaik Word can&#x27;t open ODT files)
 A limitation of org&#x27;s exporter (I just can&#x27;t export radio links/have to make [[manual links]]?)
  
Any leads or help would be appreciated.

 Are there any packages that disable using the same command twice (Like repeated C-n or C-f ) so I&#x27;m forced to move more efficiently?

                    <span>When I am using tramp to visit a remote machine in a dired buffer, I mark several files and hit shift-c to copy. But the auto completion of ivy prevents me from copying remote file to local machine, because it does not allow me to delete the ssh prefix, e.g. /ssh:jky@mac:/, once I delete to the slash, I cannot delete further. 
 How can I get rid of this behavior? Is there a variable to set? I don&#x27;t want to switch ivy on and off just to get this work.

                    <span>I use mu4e for my email management and send emails with smtp. When I send an email, I have to wait a a few seconds for authentication and sometimes even longer if the emails contains a large attachment. Also, although rare, I might be offline. Instead, I am looking into queuing my emails.
 I know of smtpmail-queue-mail and the info here, but I am wondering if there is a way to get the emails sent in the background or when emacs is idle and the internet connection is working.
 Any help/hints are appreciated.

                    <span>Hi,
 I have a lot of projects. Some work related and some are personal. I want to be able to have profiles, wherein work profile would show only work related projects and personal profile would show only personal projects.
 Is this possible to achieve?
 I am using spacemacs + projectile.

                    <span>I am trying to follow this guide to send emails via eMacs: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bfsck6/mu4e_for_dummies/
 I can receive emails and all the IMAP functions seem to be working (deleting/reading updates other mail clients).
 However, when trying to send emails it just hangs at “sending via mail…” with no obvious errors.
 I’m using ProtonMail and their bridge, with the default SSL mode. If I try changing it to STARTSSL I get either a certificate error or invalid transport method error, so I can see that it’s maybe trying to send the email if the rest of the config is broken?
 I saw this note that using contexts for smtpmail settings as outlined above might not work, but I was wondering if anyone else had thoughts on that? I’d like to not add another application to the mail process if possible.

                    <span>I was trying to compile the latest sources from the savannah.
 The configure step worked just fine but the make gave the following error:
 /usr/bin/ld: comp.o: in function Fcomp_el_to_eln_rel_filename&#x27;:
 comp.c:(.text+0x379): undefined reference to md5_stream
 I tried to clean up everything and make bootstrap but to no avail. Googling this issue also came in vain.
 ​
 I used to update and compile weekly, and everything was alright then. There was a one-month gap since my last update, and I noticed the version was bumped to 29. I was wondering if there is anything new I missed or it is because of something else.
 ​
 Has anyone encountered something similar? I am so grateful for any hints or solutions for this issue.
 Thank you for the help!

                    <span>Hello!
 I have made a blog with Yesod that uses a Postgresql database. I am trying to deploy this to Heroku. 
 I&#x27;ve tried multiple buildpacks but they all time out. I&#x27;ve tried commenting out dependencies and trying to upload it partially and I&#x27;m still not able to deploy it. Tried using Docker but I&#x27;m quite new to using it so I can&#x27;t say that I knew what I was doing there..
 Does anyone have any relevant guide that you think I can follow? Your experience with this? 
 I&#x27;m getting to a point where I&#x27;m willing to pay someone just to show me how this is done.. 
 Thank you!

                    <span>How does this code works ?
 Map ((:) x) acc
 I&#x27;m having a rough time understanding how this function should change a list/acc.
 And what about this :
 prefixes :: [a] -&gt; [[a]] prefixes &#x3D; foldr (\x acc -&gt; [x] : ( map ((:) x) acc))
 I&#x27;d like to get full explanation.

                    <span>I&#x27;m so close to nailing the first few steps of my note taking system! The final hurdle for me at the moment is getting org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton to create a much plainer output, and bonus points for it going straight into an org-roam node, but I&#x27;d happy for that not to happen.
 Currently when I run M-x org-noter-pdftools-create-skeleton I get the following org-file. I have no idea what the &#x27;contents&#x27; subheading is doing, but it seems to contain random bit from the annotation.
 Ideally I want the command to just output a bullet pointed list with the &#x27;comment&#x27; text. 
 If anyone has experience with changing the output of this command I&#x27;d love to hear what you did and how. 
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs on the whole, so forgive me if the solution appears simple!

 Hello everybody,
 droplet is a type-safe SQL library targeting (so far, only) Postgres. Two main features set it apart from similar PureScript (or Haskell) libraries:
  
SQL like DSL
  
The eDSL used tries to stay as close as possible to regular SQL. IMO, this has the advantage of making the translation from PureScript to SQL transparent, specially for more complex queries.
 So far, most common usage SQL keywords are supported, e.g., SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UNION PREPARE, etc.
  
Query mapper 
  
Query result rows are always expressed as records, with projected columns as keys. The query mapper can also be used independently from the DSL, in case raw SQL strings are needed.
 Feedback is highly welcomed. Specially ideas to improve error messages or ease the current type class abuse :)

                    <span>Michael Tsai featured a couple quotes from Matt Gemmell recently about monospace plain text and fully justified layout: 
https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/09/30/manual-full-justification/
The linked twitter thread is worth a look.
The real banger is this document: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588741-super-metroid/faqs/10114
You don&#x27;t have to actually read it; it&#x27;s a guide/walkthrough for a Super Nintendo game. The interesting detail is that the author accomplished full text justification without tweaking the spacing between words. That&#x27;s how you usually accomplish that effect in e.g. MS Word or other desktop publishing applications. The space between words is stretched.

But here, there&#x27;s only ever 1 space between words.
So the author had to write everything to fit. Conversely, that means words and sentence structures had to be picked because of their length to properly fill the available space.
Matt Gemmell points out that this is not a feat one is likely to accomplish for the lulz. It&#x27;s serious effort. And that document sure as heck is long! Now that&#x27;s some plain text dedication</span>

 It would suck if I have to leave my emacs for managing my email...

                    <span>Hello all! I would be grateful for any help with a question about org-mode. I love using org files, and displaying them in Emacs is wonderful: I have my config set up to present subtrees indented, hide leading stars, etc.
 However, I would like to improve how my .org files look when accessed by other editors (or when printed out). Without the illusion of indentation that comes from editing .org files in Emacs, the documents are (at least in my opinion) extremely hard to decipher at-a-glance; there is no obvious visual relationship between headings and subheadings.
 Ideally, I would like for the content under subheadings to actually be indented in the text files, so that they would be easy to read/skim in other editors. My searching led to me to this page in the manual, which seems to explain that this can be done if the following settings are used:
 (setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-odd-levels-only t) 
 However, even after adding these settings to my config, the behavior doesn&#x27;t change: when I save a .org buffer, it is written to disk without hard indentation. Did I misunderstand something about how this works/should work (perhaps I missed something obvious)? Has anyone else had better luck making this happen?
 Many thanks in advance for any help.

                    <span>TLDR: Try consult-dir and embark
 Lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of config hacking. I use Doom as my main daily driver, but starting a vanilla config and playing around with various packages has taught me a lot of cool stuff and helped me rethink parts of my workflow that have been fairly sub-optimal until now (naturally there&#x27;s still lots of room for further refinement).
 Yesterday and today I&#x27;ve migrated features from my vanilla config that I particularly like into my Doom config. While doing it, I got carried away with the latest commit message, which related to adding my consult-dir and embark configurations into Doom. These are both great packages and I am more than happy to do what I can to give them more attention and hopefully convince some people to check them out! Here are links to…</span>

                    <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m trying to make flymake work with a custom init function. First I needed this to make it work on the linux kernel source. I found a stackoverflow answer that creates a flymake.mk in the root of the project and makes flymake to look for that file, which only contains the make recipe check-syntax.
 Of course that didn&#x27;t work. Flymake log says: *** No rule to make target &#x27;check-syntax&#x27;. Stop.
 So I did a way simpler project, just a file.c and a Makefile, with default flymake and that worked fine. So I removed the check-syntax part from the Makefile and put it on a flymake.mk, all three files in the same directory. Now again with the custom init and doesn&#x27;t work either. First of all, I tried to see if the custom init was being selected, and it does, when I run (flymake-proc--get-fi…</span>

                    <span>tldr; You can use C-u M-x command-name to pass the Universal Argument into an interactive command. This is helpful if you do not want to bind the command to a hotkey, but still want to pass the Universal Argument into it.
 I recently encountered a situation with the anki-editor package where I wanted to pass the Universal Argument into the anki-editor-push-notes function. I did not want to create a keyboard shortcut for this command because I will use it less than once a day. First I tried things like M-x anki-editor-push-notes(4) and M-x (anki-editor-push-notes &#x27;(4)) but neither of those worked. Then, following this guide, I created a wrapper function that calls (anki-editor-push-notes &#x27;(4)). This worked fine. I could call my wrapper function which would in turn call the function I really wanted to run with the Universal Argument passed in; however, I figured out a more succinct way. Pressing C-u M-x anki-editor-push-notes will pass the Universal Argument into the command. In my opinion this is better because I don&#x27;t have to have that extra function in my init.el and I don&#x27;t have to remember two slightly distinct commands.
 I figured if I didn&#x27;t know about this and the author of this guide may not have known about this, then there may be other people on the subreddit who do not know about this. So I am just trying to share a cool thing I learned.

                    <span>I use the i3wm on a two monitor setup. 
 I generally have one Emacs GUI window/frame with my org-agenda buffer and mu4e continually open on a single workspace on one monitor. 
 Then I open a new instance of Emacs (in a new frame) for whatever project I intend to work on. If I want to pivot to an unrelated project/task, I open a new Emacs frame and edit the relevant files to that project there.
  
I&#x27;m curious to know if this is the standard in the Emacs community. I sometimes think this workflow is a bit too resource intensive, and it seems wasteful to execute init.el several times and load all my packages etc. every time I do something new (although it takes &lt;5 sec to load, which I&#x27;m happy with).
 An alternative would be running one instance of Emacs, then doing e.g. C-x 5 2 to open a new frame (but now init.el is not re-evaluated) every time I want to work on a different project/task. This also feels a bit resource heavy -- maybe the resolution of this problem is just to not open so many things at once!
 What is your workflow, and do you think it&#x27;s efficient memory wise, or helpful in terms of organization?

So I have a function for inserting the sections from parsed &#x27;result-groups&#x27; (a group is all the DOM material for one result):
 (defun my/w3m-insert-duckduckgo-section (group) (let ((href (cdar (cdadar group))) (title (caddar group)) (body (cddr (nth 1 group)))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; title))) (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;))))) 
 I&#x27;m using the &quot;this-is-the-body&quot; string in place of an actual body at the moment, because I haven&#x27;t got round to learning about parsing DOM text yet.
 I run this in a loop over all the groups, inserting each one. This runs inside a root section I insert first.
 This inserts the relevant text, but with no special properties (e.g. magit sections normally have certain faces) and no newlines. Everything is on one line, just running on to the next result.
 If I run something like this in a scratch buffer, the result is correct:
 (magit-insert-section (root) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;Header text 1&quot;)) (insert (format &quot;%s\n\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;))) (magit-insert-section (result) (magit-insert-heading (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;Header text 2&quot;)) (insert (format &quot;%s\n&quot; &quot;this-is-the-body&quot;)))) 
 Running eval-last-sexp after this in the scratch buffer works exactly as expected (standard magit section text properties, newlines are printed correctly). What&#x27;s most stange is that if I use eval-expression to run the above form in a w3m buffer, it works correctly! Correct faces and properties etc.
 So, why do the newlines and properties not show up in the w3m buffer when I call the forms programatically vs interactively, and how can I fix this?
 TIA!

                    <span>Hi emacs lovers, i use mu4e for my mail and changed to the new gnus message view, which has some nice properties amongst others an indication how long ago a message was sent.
 However, I get all the time a popup window called *appease-gnus*, which i can kill (C-x k) but keeps popping up. It looks like a hook is executed when point is on the Attachment field in mu4e:view.
 ​
 Does anyone experience this as well and knows how to stop this popup behaviour?
 Thanks in advance 
 Marcel

                    <span>Is Emacs secure ? As in, if I install some packages, will that poses any &quot;security threat&quot; to my computer ? If I rephrase that - can we make Emacs more secure maybe ? I may sound silly, but if you have any thoughts about that same, I&#x27;m very much interested in that. 
 Thank you.

                    <span>I have a social science background. Most, if not all, of my requirements consists of - taking notes and to be able to search through them to write research papers. I am already using Scrivener, which I feel, seems to do all of that pretty efficiently.
 I have a question for the Emacs community. How can Emacs help me ? I am willing to take the learning curve, but how is Emacs better than Scrivener ? That&#x27;s my main question.
 Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a cookbook using emacs org mode, and org-chef to import recipes. I set it up so that I can export to a printable bifold booklet that I can use in the kitchen, and it exports to my website: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/
 I have a couple more things I&#x27;d like it to do:
 So far I have been manually inserting page breaks with #+LATEX: \newpage to prevent recipes from splitting across odd numbered pages, so you don&#x27;t have to flip a page to see the rest of the recipe. I&#x27;d like a way to automate that if possible. I usually adjust the font size a bit to get everything to fit on a multiple of 4 pages for printing.
 On the HTML end, I&#x27;d like a simple way for each recipe heading to link back to the table of contents, to make the page easier to navigate. It would also be nice if I could get the title of the page to export as a h3 instead of h1, to match the sidebar.
 I have the org mode source here if anyone wants to take a look: https://www.gnuisnotunix.com/recipes/recipes.org

                    <span>Carsten Dominik in his Google TechTalk said that Emacs is for people who like to tinker, and that has definitely been my experience and one of the reasons I love Emacs so much. (link to talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;oJTwQvgfgMM )
 I have been using Emacs since 2016, and would roughly estimate that I have spent 100+ hours configuring Emacs to my liking (only using other packages and writing small custom functions), and I still play around with my init most weeks to update it and fine tune it to my liking. Although I could use something like Doom or Spacemacs and get a pretty awesome environment with minimal setup, creating and customising these things to my own personal taste is super satisfying. 
 Was just curious, how much time have you all spent configuring your beloved setup? :)

                    <span>A while ago u/godkbg asked about highlighting enclosing brackets.
 At the time hl-block-mode didn&#x27;t support this, since then I&#x27;ve added options to support this.
 Example configuration:
 (use-package hl-block-mode :commands (hl-block-mode) :config (setq hl-block-bracket nil) ;; Match all brackets. (setq hl-block-single-level t) ;; Only one pair of brackets. (setq hl-block-style &#x27;bracket) ;; Highlight only the brackets. :hook ((prog-mode) . hl-block-mode))

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently trying to make some bindings to a c library. The C library has a whole bunch of constructors and special destructors. Which means I can&#x27;t just free everything with free; I have to use the correct c function.
 My plan was to use the ReaderT monad to hold pointers of the allocated objects and create a typeclass for deletion which would trigger when things fall out of scope:
 class Collectable p where collect :: (MonadIO m) &#x3D;&gt; p -&gt; m () newtype CThing &#x3D; CThing (Ptr ()) instance Collectable CThing where collect (CThing p) &#x3D; ffi_c_delete_function_for_thing p 
 I then created a newtype called &#x27;Bin&#x27; for holding these objects:
 newtype Bin &#x3D; Bin { unBin :: forall p . Collectable p &#x3D;&gt; [p] } 
 The reason for this is that it complained about impredicative polymorphism if I didn&#x27;t create the newtype. It also didn&#x27;t like:
 newtype Bin &#x3D; Bin { unBin :: [forall p . Collectable p &#x3D;&gt; p] } 
 For the same reason.
 I then tried to call the delete functions on the environment:
 mapM collect $ unBin env 
 But GHC complains again:
 Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘collect’ prevents the constraint ‘(Collectable a0)’ from being solved. 
 Why can&#x27;t it solve the constraint? I have defined a bin to contain only collectable objects!?
 As you have probably worked out by now, I have very little idea what I&#x27;m doing when it comes to higher rank polymorphism! send help!
 I have a backup plan (creating a type level list for the environment and using type families to construct the Collectable class), but it seems excessive

I started migrating many of my notes, api org files (used with verb) and other things at work into it&#x27;s own private org repo. What i&#x27;d like to do is actually somehow combine the content of the repos together without actually having them go to the same repo. So at work, I can add work fiels to the work repo, while at the same time have the db include my personal files that I can also update. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s ways to manage this seamlessly so that I can not have my private content mixed with my public.

                    <span>How can I set a task to repeat only on weekdays with some specific time?
 I see some documentations Repeated tasks - Org mode, and packages like org-recur, other way that I saw on a suggestion is:
 * TODO Some task SCHEDULED:  * TODO Some task SCHEDULED:  
 Is set the same task to each day from the weekday, but I think that this approach isn&#x27;t correctly.
 Do you know if is there a way to do some task work with only weekdays (Mon to Fri) with a specific time?

                    <span>I have a social science background. Most, if not all, of my requirements consists of - taking notes and to be able to search through them to write research papers. I am already using Scrivener, which I feel, seems to do all of that pretty efficiently.
 I have a question for the Emacs org-mode community. How Emacs org-mode can help me ? I am willing to take the learning curve, but how is Emacs org-mode better than Scrivener ? That&#x27;s my main question.
 Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

                    <span>Is there a good strategy for calling C code from Scala? I know there’s JNI and JNA but they’re both pretty painful. There’s sbt-JNI, which seems good. There’s also graal but I don’t particularly want to run my C++ stuff on the VM too. Seems unnecessary. What I really want is some kind of pybind11 but for the JVM. Maybe something like cppsharp. Any thoughts?

When reporting the prior bug I noticed that my YAML Block in each note is now bold.  Moving it to the last line doesn&#x27;t change the font style back to plain.</span>

                    <span>v1.7.2
Example string of tags with the last one in the series having lost its link decoration.

It seems this behavior is when tags are not on the last line of the file.
Let me explain the following GIF. 
I then line feed 3X, and up arrow, so I&#x27;m not on the last line of the file, and after each tag, a space character causes the last tag to lose its link decorations.
Notice the tag in the YAML block. It is not on the last line of the file, and it has no link decoration because it has a space character after it.

EDIT::
It is the last word in the tag that loses its link decoration. In this screenshot, only the second half of the two-word tag is affected.</span>

                    <span>ok - so I&#x27;m trying to do something I THINK should be simple, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it.
 I want to do something pretty conceptually simple. But I don&#x27;t know enough elisp to figure out how to do it.
 I have helm configured with helm-bibtex, I have org, and org-roam, and org-ref all more or less installed and working.
 EDIT: in response to a comment below - I also have org-roam-bibtex as well. 
 What I want to have happen is when I open helm-bibtex and select a paper, and then select edit notes, that instead of opening a note with the paper title (as it does now) it runs the org-roam capture template and creates an org-roam node (if one doesn&#x27;t exist) or opens an existing org-roam node (if it already exists) with the the cite-key as the file name, the paper title as the title, the author&#x27;s name filled in, etc.
 Any idea how I can do this?

                    <span>Now pressing &#x60;C-c C-e h o&#x60; takes half a minute to generate one HTML export. 
 Some one posted the same question a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/mmdeei/how_to_speed_up_org_exportpublish/, but things may get worse as org-roam files number goes up.
 Do any org-roam users run into the same issue? I guess I could consolidate multiple org roam files into one while still keeping the node IDs. 
 Do you have any workarounds or comments?

                    <span>Hello all,
 I have been using org-noter and pdf-tools for taking notes during lectures and annotating the slides. However, I would like to have an option to :
  
Automatically update my notes with the highlighted portions, without having to call org-noter-create-skelton every time (more over this function executes interactively so I have to select the options every time). This would make it easier to switch seamlessly between the pdf and the notes.
 When adding precise notes with the shortcut M-i, highlight the corresponding portion in the pdf automatically.
  
Is there any config that I am using missing to achieve these two features ?

                    <span>I am required to write a function that compares the elements of two lists in Haskell. I want to write the function to have the data type signature a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]. Here, the a can either be Integers or be tuples (Integers, Integers). I want my function to work in both cases. However, as far as I am aware, tuples cannot be compared with the &quot;&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot; sign, right? So, the function I have so far
 findE n [] &#x3D; []
 findE n (m:zs) &#x3D; if (n &#x3D;&#x3D; m) then findE n zs else m:(findE n zs)
 will work fine for when a &#x3D;&#x3D; Integer but not for when the elements in the list are two-component tuples right? I was looking for how to improve my code so that it works for both cases. Also, it would be preferable if no modules need to be imported unless absolutely necessary to make this function universal for a lot of types. Thank you!

                    <span>I am looking to write a zip function in Haskell, such that each element of list 1 combines to form a tuple with each element of list 2, something like -
 zip&#x27; [0,1,2] [3,4,5] &#x3D; [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
 I was wondering if there is a way possible to describe such a function using the original zip. Or ideas on any other way in which this can be done are appreciated!
 I was thinking of &quot;zip (map list1) list2&quot; however this is not really yielding the results it should.

 So I would like to place a static file somewhere inside my source library, a git repository with a directory of Haskell modules together with a cabal file. But what&#x27;s the best way to configure the location of that static template file? What&#x27;s the best way to access it from file system as the default file from within my code?

                    <span>I am writing a code to check if two lists in Haskell contain the same elements. I cannot use library functions for my code, however. Any advice on how I should proceed with this? Although ideally, I am interested in knowing if there is a way to do this even if the lists have duplicates, I am thinking of writing a code to remove duplicates and then check if the two lists are equal. I already have the code written to remove the duplicates, but cannot think of what to do next to actually compare the lists both ways (i.e, to check if both have exactly the same elements).

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to get a better grasp on the type system of purescript. One thing I&#x27;m struggling to fully understand is how the so-called &quot;kind system&quot; works. The language reference is very brief about it.
 Are there other resources available (perhaps with more examples) that explain this?

                    <span>Hello fellow Zettelkasteners. I have heard that zettel notes should be written in one&#x27;s own words. But I have never understood what it means to write notes in your own words. Most of the time I just copy a passage with minor changes or I translate an English passage as if I copied it.
I thought about different strategies. I could first read a paragraph, then close the book, then rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text. Or I could simply read the text and not bother with the information within and just write my thoughts that could come into my mind. Or I could write the note as if I explained it to my mom.
Note that I write my zettel notes in Romanian so when I read a text in English I translate it in Romanian. Not that it helps.
Am I missing something? Can you tell me how can I write a zettel note without copying from the text or write it in my own words?</span>

                    <span>I got a version of snake working with the threepenny-gui library, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that I was explicitly calling newEvent and addStateUpdate manually instead of defining the behavior completely based on events, e.g. this:
 (updates, addUpdate)  addUpdate $ \manager -&gt; manager&#x27; 
 compared to:
 managerB  \manager -&gt; manager&#x27; 
 IIUC the second is more idiomatic FRP, as it defines a behavior with the actual event instead of creating a proxy event to proxy updates through. But when I make this change, it causes one of two problems:
  
If I define managerB first (using RecursiveDo to access timer, which is defined below), nothing&#x27;s rendered at all
 If I move managerB to the end (using RecursiveDo to access managerB from the DOM elements), the initial movement when hitting an arrow key for the first time lags, and the frames render in a jerky fashion.
  
Am I doing something wrong? What&#x27;s the idiomatic way I should structure these events/behaviors?

                    <span>You can find the code here: https://github.com/santiweight/poker
 Over the last 1-2 years, I&#x27;ve accumulated a good amount of poker-related code that I think would be best to share! Over this week I&#x27;ll be adding some more libraries to the collection of poker libraries, but this is a good place to start :)
 I&#x27;m hoping for:
  
feedback: anything you think/feel about the library and its goals
 usage: try and use the library - tell me if it&#x27;s helpful...
 review: look at the library code, let me know where I need to make improvements.
  
I haven&#x27;t yet been able to upload to Hackage, because I don&#x27;t yet have uploader status. I&#x27;m not restless here (I only asked for permission last night). But let me know if you have any issues downloading. I&#x27;ll also be around all day (west coast USA) to discuss the code in chat or phone call.

                    <span>in polysemy, freer-simple and effectful there are two different functions for interpreting an effect:
 interpret :: e :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; (e a -&gt; Eff es a) -&gt; Eff (e &#x27;: es) a -&gt; Eff es a reinterpret :: e :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; (e a -&gt; Eff (e&#x27; &#x27;: es) a) -&gt; Eff (e &#x27;: es) a -&gt; Eff (e&#x27; &#x27;: es) a 
 reinterpret is mostly used to interpret an effect into several other effects:
 m :: Logging :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Eff es () myHandler :: Writer [String] :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Logging a -&gt; Eff es a reinterpret myHandler m :: Eff (Writer [String] &#x27;: es) () 
 However in any case I am aware of, I could also use interpret to reach similar goal, even with a more lenient signature:
 interpret myHandler m :: Writer [String] :&gt; es &#x3D;&gt; Eff es () 
 Given that, is there practically anything that is only representable via reinterpret?

                    <span>For example a defined syntax shows Nat:
 data Exp &#x3D; Zero
 | Succ Exp
 &quot;No instance for (Arbitrary Exp)&quot; error shows up when I tried to check on some function which are using Exp. 
 It seems like I should set a instance for the Exp because it is not support in Prelude, this link gives some examples, but I am still struggling on create instance for Exp, any instructions on this? Yes, I am new to QC, I would be appreciate!

                    <span>I would like to pick up a workflow manager for my data transformation and analysis pipeline. As it&#x27;s comprised of calls to bioinformatics command line tools and custom R scripts that sometimes have to be submitted to an HPC, I require a fairly flexible solution. 
 There are a billion of them out there (https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), so the decision which one to choose is not exactly easy. Most of my colleagues rely on Nextflow and Snakemake, so I should consider these, but before I start to learn an entirely new language I wanted to explore the Haskell ecosystem for possible solutions. Strong typing should in theory be a perfect match for a pipeline manager. And having this in Haskell would simplify replacing some of my R code with Haskell eventually.
 So far I saw three tools:
  
Funflow: https://github.com/tweag/funflow
 Porcupine: https://github.com/tweag/porcupine
 Bioshake: https://github.com/PapenfussLab/bioshake
  
Is here anybody who uses any of these in production and could share their experiences? Are there other Haskell-based pipeline tools? Is the user community for these tools just to small to make them a feasible choice?

                    <span>I posted something similar before but can I get an opinion on this: https://www.sandromaglione.com/how-to-use-fpdart-functional-programming-in-dart-and-flutter/
 Dart is a null-safe language that I am using for Flutter development and because I want to learn Haskell but my new job takes up so much of my time, I am looking for options where I can combine both. However, reading the documentation above, and with my still-novice Haskell knowledge it is not immediately clear to me if:
 - this is going to help me learn Haskell
 I am already using a package called Freezed for immutable classes (along with a state management package called Riverpod) which in tandem with null-safety makes the code &quot;error-safe&quot; enough. 
 FYI shifting from almost purely academic coding to &quot;doing-it-for-a-living&quot; was invigorating at first but now I feel trapped because I have to learn and get better at what my company uses (Dart, Flutter, FastAPI) leaving me too exhausted. I finally had a whole day off today but still ended up polishing the app I am working on. There has to be light at the end of the tunnel?

                    <span>Org 9.5 has been recently released, and the Org project is looking for help.
 The best way to help are these:
  
Check confirmed bugs and try to provide a patch to fix them.
 Check requests for help and volunteer to tackle one.
 Check *.el file that have no maintainer and propose to become one.
 Please see others ways to contribute as detailed on Worg.
  
When contributing, always beware of the maintenance burden: are you alleviating it or are you adding to it? Be bold, take ownership, be constructive, learn the ropes with the community and enjoy!

                    <span>The Haskell.org committee is considering a change to the Haskell.org Downloads page. The change is being reviewed in a GitHub PR.
 The specifics of the change are to replace Chocolatey with ghcup as the preferred installation method of GHC, cabal-install and haskell-language-server on Windows. The overall effect is that the install instructions become common over Windows, Linux and MacOS. The Chocolatey install method is mentioned further down the page. (The PR does not impinge on Stack. The Stack instructions remain unchanged.)
 The committee would welcome input from any interested parties, particularly those who have familiarity with Chocolatey, or ghcup on Windows, or both. You are welcome to comment on the PR itself.
 Thanks to bodigrim for the PR.

                    <span>hi all,
 new to orgmode. can someone help me amend the following sample config? 
 C-c c t adds a todo item under a title &quot;Tasks&quot; like this:
 *Tasks
 ** TODO todo item
 but i would like to add the todo item without the *Tasks title. also, if possible i would like it to be inserted at the top of the file as the first in the list instead of the bottom.
 any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

                    <span>Is there a way to have the carry-over of unfinished-todos that org-journal offers to also work in org-roam dailies? 
 I do like the &quot;integration&quot; of my dailies (which I often use to structure my day - a bit out of my head, maybe because I do not harness the power of the agenda yet..) and also the fact that there are some backlinks when I just jot down some notes on it.
 But I am missing the feature of taking unfinished todos from the past to the current day - to finish stuff that I could not finish the last day..
 Any ideas about this?

                    <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 I&#x27;m experiencing some doubts when implementing the behavior of my entities using companion object, case class and the new given/using concept(the reborn implicit).
 So...
 Let&#x27;s imagine that we are defining an User abstraction that should contain the behavior of addFriend.
 Is this the right location to place the addFriend method and to consume it?
 Idk... It doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;right&quot; this need of declaring given User &#x3D; user and calling the addFriend from the companion object
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala sealed trait User(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User])
 object Users { enum UserProfile: case Common
 final case class CommonUser private(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User]) extends User
 def create(id: String, name: String, friends: List[User] &#x3D; List()): User &#x3D; { ... }
 def addFriend(friend: User)(using user: User): Unit &#x3D; { ... } }
 val myUser &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeMyUserId&quot;, &quot;fakeMyUserName&quot;) val friend &#x3D; Users.create(&quot;fakeFriendId&quot;, &quot;fakeFriendName&quot;)
 given User &#x3D; myUser val myUserWithFriends &#x3D; Users.addFriend(friend) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 ScalaMock doesnt seem to exist for scala3, at least sbt couldnt install, and I want to easily create fake instances that my class to be tested depends on.

                    <span>When reading texts, I occasionally find that I didn&#x27;t understand something very well.
I follow a modified version of the Feynman Technique for writing Zettels. Also, I write in a notebook first, then transcribe the writing into my computer to avoid editing while writing.
However, when there are gaps, I&#x27;m not too keen on the idea of referring to resources until I can fill in the gaps. It means that I have to switch from writing to reading. Reading is low effort to me while writing is demanding. I&#x27;m most energetic in the morning. Thus, I&#x27;d rather use my mornings to write than to read if I have anything to write about.
But, if I split the tasks, I need to do something about what I&#x27;ve written so I can address the gaps and re-use the text. I&#x27;ve tried multiple approaches to deal with this to no avail.
So I ask: What is your approach to handle gaps in your understanding when processing reading notes?</span>

                    <span>Hi, brand new Zettelkaster here - as in, I&#x27;ve been reading blogs about it and just ordered How to Take Smart Notes but I haven&#x27;t started implementing anything yet. I feel like I&#x27;ll learn the principles better if I can immediately start implementing the practices, and that means I need to choose what software I&#x27;m going to use (definitely not a card-and-box system - my handwriting isn&#x27;t up to the task).
My existing workflow involves 1) highlighting and commenting on scholarly papers and ebooks in Mendeley; 2) highlighting and scribbling in the margin of hard copy books; 3) saving popular press articles to Evernote from Chrome. Then I write in Word. As you can see, something to process and organize notes and move them smoothly to the writing process is greatly needed.
Since I already have several programs in this process, my top consideration for Zettelkasten software is that it be intuitive and work out-of-the-box without me having to hack any fixes.
I have seen that some people use Evernote for Zettelkasten and I wonder if that&#x27;s the way to go, to avoid proliferating software. It would be nice if I could click from my note on an article to easily see the article itself. However, looking at the earlier thread on Evernote, it seemed to get a bit technical with people figuring out plug-ins and fixes - I wonder if there&#x27;s software I will find more simple and intuitive for Zettlekasten.
Thanks very much in advance for your help!</span>

Which books would you recommend?
And is &quot;Sascha&#x27;s book published&quot;?
Maybe there should be a FAQ section somewhere collecting info ressources like books and videos?</span>

                    <span>Hello,
 In my org-mode workflow, I export the work done in the week and all current tasks with:
 elisp (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;W&quot; &quot;Weekly Review&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 7))) (todo &quot;TODO&quot;) (todo &quot;STRT&quot;) (todo &quot;LOOP&quot;) (todo &quot;WAIT&quot;)) ; review waiting items ((org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t))) ))  Then I write the list with org-agenda-write. The problem is that I loose heading tree during the process.
 What I got:
 org * DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] * TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 What I want: org * API development ** DONE [ISSUE] Fix missing dependencies CLOSED: [2021-09-27 lun. 14:01] blablabla * Architecture ** DONE Roadmap for sandbox creation CLOSED: [2021-09-28 mar. 15:09] ** TODO Add option to enable debug level - [x] for logs - [x] requests on database 
 Is it possible to keep global heading when exporting agenda view ?

                    <span>I&#x27;m thinking about how to efficiently using org-mode to make notes while reading a large presentation (e.g. a PowerPoint file, .pptx-file, with a few hundred slides). Any thoughts on this? 
 I&#x27;m looking for tips in general and to see if this topic results in some interesting discussion.
 The tips could e.g. be about how to use org-mode, how to structure the notes, or techniques and tools about how to import information from the presentation into the .org-file.
 When I google this, I mostly find tips about _writing_ a presentation using org-mode. Instead I&#x27;m looking for tips that could be e.g. (some obvious/general examples): The notes should...
  
Reference the presentation (with it&#x27;s title, file location, author, origin) 
 E.g. through a link to the file.

                    <span>I&#x27;m doing literate programming and ran into a bug using source blocks. Just in case it was my setup, I validated this using Portacle with emacs-lisp as the language.
 Parens are matched correctly
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Open paren in the string is no problem
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 The addition of an escaped-quote breaks matching.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello ( \&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 Double escape closes the string early as expected and results in illegal syntax.
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun foo () (princ &quot;Hello (\\&quot;there&quot;)) #+END_SRC 
 I could not replicate in lisp-mode major.
 Any ideas? Should I take this to #IRC? Is this org-babel or some other component?

                    <span>So I’m pretty new to scala. I’m building a greenfield application and need to solve my CRUD problem. 
 I’d like to bring a bit of the functional paradigm to CRUD operations. 
 “Find all case class objects in table that pass function, apply this function to update”
 You get the idea. Sorry if my terminology is off anywhere and please correct. 
 My requirements are: 1. Nothing experimental, this is an enterprise application 2. Readability 3. Leverages functional expressiveness
 4. You have personally used it before and have lived with its growing pains. 5. Compatible with SSMS
 Frankly there are so many options and I’m overwhelmed, could use some help narrowing down the field.

                    <span>As a scala data engineer, I normally write some ETL projects and bigdata projects using Spark.
 I learned about functional programming lately and got to know about Cats.
 I see cats is very useful in the aspects of dealing with NullPointer Exception as well as providing higher abstraction for Try, Option, Eigher, Future classes.
 My question is, unlike some other program like web, which is not allowed to crash on runtime, data engineer&#x27;s job allows programming crash and sometimes it&#x27;s more desirable for me to fail fast so I can know what&#x27;s wrong immediately. I don&#x27;t need my data job to run all the time and finally I can only find it&#x27;s wrong in the log.
 With that in mind, I found the Try, Option, Either, Future seems not so useful to me. Because if I use them, I had to use some option.get
 or either.left.get
 to get the method result, which seems rather unnecessary. Otherwise, the program never fail.
 In my company, people don&#x27;t know Cats, but they can carry out their data development normally.
 So is my above perspective right? Please correct me if anything wrong in my thinking.

                    <span>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a MCMC sampling algorithm which proposes new states based on the simulation of Hamilton’s equations of motion.
One of the main ingredients of this algorithm is its integration scheme — how the equations are discretized and its solutions found.
The standard choice for this is the classical leapfrog.
In this blog post we present our empirical investigation of U7U_7U7​ — an algorithm that is computationally more expensive, but also more accurate.
This trade-off is not a simple one (after all, more precision implies less tries), but our explorations show that this is a promising algorithm, which can outperform leapfrog in some cases.
We don’t suppose previous knowledge of integration methods, but in case you are new to HMC or MCMC methods, a good starting point…</span>

                    <span>Hi all, is it possible to use synctex with an org file? So for example I&#x27;d like to do forward search (whilst in org file find corresponding place in pdf), and reverse search (whilst in pdf find corresponding place in org file). The closest I can currently get is to add #+LaTeX_HEADER: \synctex&#x3D;1 to the org file which gets me reverse search in the pdf and be directed not to the org file, but to the intermediate tex file that org creates when compiling org to pdf. 
 I feel like org to pdf bidirectional linking should be possible in 2021. To me this is pretty much the only thing holding me back from using orgmode for all pdf generation.
 Many thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently found the Google Maps feature that allows you to save places and organize them into lists (e.g., restaurants you have been recommended), and then choose to show in the map or not the places in a given list. I find it really useful and would like to start using it more, but I don&#x27;t think those lists are a good way to organize a large amount of places, and have some privacy issues with Google Maps. I would rather use org-mode to organize them, and then export them whenever I want to some other open maps application, or maybe keep them synchronized automatically. Do any of you know of something that implements this or something similar?

                    <span>I have the following two tables:
 | ! | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 | | slope | intercept | xval | yval | |---+-------+-----------+-------+------| | | 1.2 | -5 | 1.4 | | | | 2.4 | 2 | -5 | | | | -5.6 | -3 | 2.2 | | | | -0.2 | 4 | 2.718 | | | | .56 | 3.14 | -0.5 | | #+TBLFM: $5&#x3D;$2*$4+$3 
 The only difference between these tables is that the first has named columns while the second doesn&#x27;t. For both tables, I can calculate values in the last column one at a time by doing M-x org-table-recalculate or C-c *, but iteratively updating the table using M-x org-table-iterate or C-u C-u C-c * only works for the second table. For the first table, if I run org-table-iterate, I get the message &quot;Table was already stable.&quot; Is this a bug, or am I not understanding how named columns are supposed to work?
 I am running Org 9.4.6 and Emacs 27.2 on Windows 10
 Update: I posted this question on StackExchange and someone pointed out the following from the Org manual. So it turns out I didn&#x27;t understand how named columns work 😄
  
The documentation (C-h i g(org)Advanced Features) says: 
 Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the table with ‘C-u C-c *’ only affects rows that are marked ‘#’ or ‘*’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself. The column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.
