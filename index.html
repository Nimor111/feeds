                              <span>I&#x27;ve had to move my developing of Haskell code from a system that I did not maintain myself, to my own laptop. The thing is: on the old system whoever set that thing up made it so that all Haskell libraries were available. I could just include them and run ghci and it would run without a hassle and I could do this without fiddling around with Cabal. Just compile and run any file without bothering about project configs and whatever.
 Since moving to my laptop and trying to do the same here, I consistently get messages about missing modules.
 Example:
 &quot;Could not find module ‘Control.Monad.Par’&quot;
 I&#x27;ve tried reading about how to do it, but introductory guides to Cabal all talk about setting up project stuff, which was not at all necessary on the old system. On the old system I could create a .hs file wherever I wanted and compile it with ghc/ghci easily. I did not need to set up Cabal projects to do it.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am trying to write a sort of repl for a hex editor. The work of the hex editor is irrelevent. I have some functions all of them return an Either String (String, Core) where Core contains information about the current state of the program. In order to execute those functions, I store the functions and the commands that correspond to them in a Map String (String -&gt; Either String (String, Core)) but this doesn&#x27;t work that well because the user may want to load a file into the program meaning that some functions may be IOs so what would be a better way to do what I want (without having to make everything IO)?
 Thanks

                              <span>I have the following class:
 class Entity a id where getId :: a -&gt; id 
 I use this class to represent data that have an identity, so for example:
 data Person &#x3D; Person { id :: Int, name :: String } instance Entity Person Int where getId &#x3D; Person.id 
 This instance allows me to compare Persons even if they changed their name. What I have noticed is that in several places in my code, I&#x27;m repeating the same comparison:
 (getId personInThePast) &#x3D;&#x3D; (getId samePerson) 
 It would be great if I could write the following:
 personInThePast &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; samePerson 
 The idea would be that the compiler would know it should just compare their IDs. I can make an Eq instance of Person, but if I follow that path, I would repeat the same code for all my Entity. Since I know how to equate any Entity, I thought that I could write an Eq instance for my Entity class, but the compiler complains that Entity is a constraint, so now I don&#x27;t know how to implement this. Any help?

 That&#x27;s brilliant, but is there a way to reverse this?
 Say I have this:
 data Person &#x3D; Person {personId :: Int, personName :: T.Text, personAge :: Int} deriving (Show) mapToPerson :: (Int, T.Text, Int) -&gt; Person mapToPerson (a, b, c) &#x3D; Person a b c 
 I want to generalize uncurry to any arguments, could I then do something like:
 mapToPerson &#x3D; ~(,,) . Person

                              <span>Hello, I am trying to build a parser to parse command line arguments of the following form.
 ​
 -verbose -leftString STRING -rightString STRING 
 Two of the arguments take a parameter of type String. If some of them i snot specified, I have default values for them (in my structure Arguments {verbose :: Bool, leftString :: Maybe String, rightString :: Maybe String}I would use False, Nothing, Nothing.
 However, the flag (the argument) can be specified more then once, in which case the last flag is decisive (i.e. &quot;./program -leftString foo -leftString bar&quot; would become Arguments False &quot;bar&quot; Nothing after parsing).
 ​
 I know, how to do a parser for each of these options returning Parser Bool (or Parser String, respectively). But how do I make them run repeatedly until all of them fail (the arguments do not need to be in any particular order, so I have to try all of them for each argument). I could achieve that by using something like many $ choice [...], but that doesn&#x27;t let me to gradually update the parsed values (if more flags, only last flag value is kept).
 ​
 Or, I could use something like optional in sequence where I set the default value to the last parsed (or the default one if no parsed value yet). But optional always succeeds and I would never know if this is the last time I succeeded and I should stop parsing.
 ​
 What can I do?

 i tried to write an parser and an interpreter for System F Omega in Haskell. My goal is not to write the Functions for Substitution myself but use Haskell Functions , but I don&#x27;t know if that is possible.
 I&#x27;ve seen this Code in my FP-Lecture an I would also like to write an interpreter that is safe and easy and doesn&#x27;t needs much Code.

                              <span>Emacs has lots of features and lots of packages written for it.
 There should be a webpage demonstrating such features and packages with a short description and instantly viewable video demos, so browsing users could instantly see how a feature works without installing anything. Such a page could be a great way to demonstrate Emacs&#x27; capabilites.
 VSCode has such a page, here it is: https://vscodecandothat.com
 Instead of youtube videos animated gifs can work too like in this page which demonstrates Helm&#x27;s capabilities with text and animgifs:
 https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html
 There is this list, but it&#x27;s only text:
 https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs
 Having animgif demos is important, because then the user can instantly see the value of a feature without installing and configuring it first.
 Such a page could be shown to new users, so they can browse it and find useful packages which they may not find otherwise for a long time.
 The community could create a page like this by people contributing animgifs demoing their favorite features and collecting these on a webpage.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about archiving workflow. Flat vs. Trees. In most posts that I see about this, a person that&#x27;s usually fairly new to org-mode will lament org-mode&#x27;s default flat-ish method of archiving, in which the original parent tree context is set as a property. Then discussion about how to do it that way, either through a function or through project management (only archive once the project is closed out), separate files per project, etc.
 What I&#x27;d like to know is who among you prefers the default flat-ish method for archiving, and how does that work for you? How do you resolve the typical objections to that method, which drives people to seek out a tree-mimicking approach?

                              <span>Apologize if the title is not as clear. I have an org file, it includes the listing package, and setup its own lstlisting:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{listings} #+LATEX_HEADER: \lstdefinestyle{BashInputStyle}{language&#x3D;bash,basicstyle&#x3D;\large\ttfamily, numbers&#x3D;left,numberstyle&#x3D;\tiny,numbersep&#x3D;3pt,frame&#x3D;tb} Normal include code from outside #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex \lstinputlisting[language&#x3D;Python,style&#x3D;BashInputstyle]{hello.py} #+END_EXPORT 
 which renders like this:
 ​

 I use this to include long code block, it has its own file outside of org mode. For short codes, I tried to use org babel. I want this org babel, when exported, to have the same listing style as above, when you include from outside. This answer suggests doing:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{listings} #+LATEX_HEADER: \lstdefinestyle{BashInputStyle}{language&#x3D;bash,basicstyle&#x3D;\large\ttfamily, numbers&#x3D;left,numberstyle&#x3D;\tiny,numbersep&#x3D;3pt,frame&#x3D;tb} Normal include code from outside #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex \lstinputlisting[language&#x3D;Python,style&#x3D;BashInputstyle]{hello.py} #+END_EXPORT Now org babel block #+ATTR_LATEX: :options style&#x3D;BashInputStyle #+BEGIN_SRC bash echo &quot;hello world&quot; #+END_SRC 
 I tried and got error, in fact it rendered incorrectly. This is my log and resulting tex file.

 Is it possible to have the include code and the org babel code to have consistent style?

                              <span>I use the i3 window manager. I start the Emacs client (using systemd unit) with a keyboard shortcut:
 bindsym $mod+F1 exec emacsclient -ce &#x27;(toggle-frame-fullscreen)&#x27; 
 This works perfectly, but I would like the client to start at login. The last line in my i3 config file is:
 exec emacsclient -ce &#x27;(toggle-frame-fullscreen)&#x27; 
 But this does not seem to work and I still have to start the client manually. Any suggestions what I am doing wrong?

                              <span>When I record a sequence of keystrokes with start-kbd-macro and call it, emacs replays all keystrokes immediately. However I want it to replay keystrokes exactly as I typed them. So that calling the macro looked less like a shortcut and more like if a ghost writer was typing it. Adding intervals between keystrokes during playback won&#x27;t suffice. How can I preserve the original delays between inputs? 
 upd: random intervals between keystrokes won&#x27;t suffice either. Do you know of any existing package that records both the keystrokes and original delays?

In other words, it replaces characters rather than push them to the side. I want to disable whatever might be causing this, but I am unsure about what is causing it.

 ediff-diff-program &#x3D; &quot;diff&quot; which I suspect is powershell &quot;compare-object&quot;
 ediff-diff-options &#x3D; defaults to --binary leads to the following
  
diff: E200016: Error in options to internal diff 
 diff: E200016: invalid option: --binary
  
ediff-diff-options &#x3D; &quot;&quot; leads to an *ediff-errors* buffer which is a mixture of diff +/- lines not separated into colourized versions of original buffer

 This Emacs configuration aims to be uncluttered, clean, vanilla, and practically useful for any day-to-day tasks.
 It only has the absolute necessary configurations, tailored to be minimal w/ vanilla keybindings, practical and useful. It is easy to add any additional feature and package later if you need one.
 There are several reasons for keeping the configuration to a bare minimum, one is that it’s easier to keep track of all the packages and keystrokes. It is better to have a setup that you use 90% of the time, than having a cluttered setup that will just make it difficult to keep up with gazillions of preinstalled packages that usually end-up being unused.
 This configuration tries not to be a one-size-fits all configuration, but it tries to be an Emacs configuration that suits most of the developers, and I keep it personable, clean, easy and sensible.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Doom. When exporting my Org to HTML, it uses my current Emacs theme&#x27;s syntax highlighting colors to highlight the source in the exported file too. The issue I have is, my Doom theme is dark (Dracula). It looks terrible on a light HTML document. The yellow is barely visible.
 How can I fix this? How would I easily change the source block highlighter theme to something that looks better in light?

                              <span>The following code passes compilation (Scala 3), which left me surprised for a while: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; case class Polygon(x : Int)
 object Polygon { given Conversion[Polygon, List[Int]] with def apply(x : Polygon) &#x3D; x }
 @main def hello: Unit &#x3D; println(Polygon(6).length) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Obviously this is an infinite loop, but I thought it would be fun to share.

My goal is twofold: (1) I hope to motivate those who prefer paper-based thinking systems, and (2) I hope to present an alternative perspective for those who use digital Zettelkasten systems. I hope my perspective will add one or two valuable insights you can add to your Zettelkasten workflow (even a digital one).

                              <span>What Happened
On the morning of the 22nd of March, 2022, we were notified about the
existence of an unknown critical vulnerability on one of Minswap’s
contracts. Everyone here on the audit team was dismayed, since we had
conducted an audit for Minswap not long before. We found 3 critical
issues that would have likewise enabled an attacker to empty the
reserves, and 13 issues in total, but failed to find this one.

How It Happened
The heart of the vulnerability lies in this seemingly harmless
function which checks that a given value possesses a single unit of an
asset class:
isUnity :: Value -&gt; AssetClass -&gt; Bool
isUnity v c &#x3D; assetClassValueOf v c &#x3D;&#x3D; 1

While harmless in isolation, in the context it was used isUnity
revealed itself to be disastrous:

                              <span>What I&#x27;m using:
  
GNU Emacs 27.2 
 Manjaro Linux 21.2.5 (codename: Qonos)
 Doom core v3.0.0-dev
 Doom modules v22.03.0-dev
 Ivy Version: 0.13.4
  
Issue*: 
 Some manpages do not show up when I run M-x man. Apparently, this only happens with non-default packages which I installed manual with pacman, probably with whatever I install from the aur as well, but I didn&#x27;t test it. 
 For example, on the command line,$ man yt-dlp shows me the correct manpage, while on Emacs M-x man followed by yt-dlp does not list its corresponding manpage. 
 $ whereis yt-dlp show that yt-dlp manpage is at the correct location: yt-dlp: /usr/bin/yt-dlp /usr/share/man/man1/yt-dlp.1.gz. 
 The issue occurs with ivy-mode disabled as well.
 Posting here first instead of /r/doom because I figure this might be a system vs Emacs thing, and not a Doom thing...

                              <span>So I have a mac with Big Sur 11.6.4 and am running emacs 27.2 on it. I&#x27;m writing a program locally and every time I save it my mac pinwheels. It only started happening yesterday but it will pinwheel for a good 30-60 seconds and no other application does this. The file isn&#x27;t particularly large, it&#x27;s around 750 lines.... my project only has two branches and like 10 files, but all the editing is happening in just one of them. It&#x27;s pretty annoying since I&#x27;m in the habit of saving frequently.
 I am just an ignorant student trying to get my assignment done, so go easy on me :)

                              <span>hey guys, 
 I installed php-mode and when I open a php file I see that my php file is almost NOT highlighted. Variables, class names, strings, method calls are not really distinguished among each other. 
 Is it how it&#x27;s intended? If not, do you have any hints on how I can debug this issue?

                              <span>Hi! I use Emacs to write documentation, and a lot of times my files end up with some internal markup that looks like this: [TK: Where is the event handler defined?] in-line with the text. (&quot;TK&quot; is writer speak for &quot;to come&quot;), since the only common English words that have &#x27;tk&#x27; in them are &quot;pocketknife&quot; and &quot;hotkey&quot;, and case sensitivity matters.)
 I added &quot;TK&quot; to hl-todo-keyword-faces, but I discovered that hl-todo uses a regexp like (^|\s)(), so the opening bracket confuses hl-todo and it doesn&#x27;t show up in the todo lists.
 I wrote a quick perl script to place a space before the bracket, and it worked, and now the magit-status buffer says my documentation folder has 59 TODOs over 41 markdown files-- which is great!-- but it won&#x27;t list them! Which is not great.
 So:
  
Remembering to include the space in [ TK: ...] is a pain in the neck, and looks terrible. Is there a way to modify the regexp such that the opening bracket is a legal character to hl-todo without hacking hl-todo&#x27;s source in the elpa folder?
 
Has anyone seen this where Magit-todo won&#x27;t list the TODOs? What do I do? I&#x27;m not the world&#x27;s greatest elisp hacker, and it&#x27;s always good to task first before trying to figure out for myself.
 
 Thanks it advance.

 When I start and stop the clock, the timer is running and I can clearly see it in the modeline. However, when I clock out, the time entry in the properties drawer said 0:00, even though the starting time and the ending time is correct, yet the running time is still 0:00
 CLOCK: [2022-03-24 T5 22:05]--[2022-03-24 T5 22:07] &#x3D;&gt; 0:00
 (setq org-clock-rounding-minutes 0)
 Please help me with this problem. I&#x27;m using doom emacs.

 If I want to launch an AppImage program (Logseq in this case), how would I do that from within Emacs?
 At the very least I would like to be able to &quot;background&quot; the spawned process (&amp;), so I can continue using Emacs. Even better would be to also &quot;disown&quot; the process. (I don&#x27;t know to do this at the moment with &quot;! vlc &amp;&quot; either)

 Title says, wonder how to select all heading faces with one face, currently i have smng like:
 &#x27;(org-level-1 ((t (:inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch)))) &#x27;(org-level-2 ((t (:inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch)))) &#x27;(org-level-3 ((t (:inherit &#x27;fixed-pitch)))) ... 
 would like to replace it with one line if possible :)

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to accomplish some SVG drawing with Haskell. Any language, really, but my go to is Haskell. I&#x27;m not really opposed to another language if anyone has a really great library in another language but that&#x27;s perhaps off topic. I&#x27;m having trouble finding a library that really does everything I want.
 What I&#x27;m trying to do is draw a series of SVGs that are all varied but similar in many ways. So code sharing is important, which is why I can&#x27;t do this in SVG and I need a programming language to generate them. I need to load in SVGs that I&#x27;m using from other sources as icons and also fonts and things like that.
 This is what I&#x27;ve looked into and found.
 svg-tree seems to be the library with the ability to read in SVG files and parse them into internal docs to manipulate.
 lucid-svg, which is recommended by svg-tree for doing actual drawing, doesn&#x27;t seem to have this, but is much better for providing a drawing API, which I&#x27;ll be using a lot of.
 svg-builder is very similar to lucid-svg, same up sides, a bit of an annoying use of hard to read operators for the attributes instead of just using tuples and lists, in my opinion, but fine, no reader still though.
 blaze-svg seems to not have any parser either, have much less documentation, and have a less nice API for drawing.
 I don&#x27;t think the svg-tree data types are compatible with lucid-svg, but that&#x27;d be nice if they were based on each other.
 Does anyone know of a good setup for what I&#x27;m trying to do?

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a dissertation with org-mode. Each chapter lives in its own org file. I also have an outline.org file which holds the outline of all the chapters. Basically, I&#x27;m wondering whether it&#x27;s possible to use #+INCLUDE to only import the headers from each file (and none of its content), so that my outline.org file can be updated automatically. This seems like it should be possible, but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out. Any help would be appreciated.

 C-e works fine to have them all go to the end of their lines. 
 C-a is bound to crux-beginning-of-line

                              <span>Hi there,
 I had to use vscode/intellij and want to back to emacs. basically all I need is ok exept the multiple cursor select and moves that I miss a lot.
 I want to add up or down multiple cursor from where my cursor is and from that add text or have the availbility to put all the cursor to end of line with ctrl+e. 
 here is a example in video
 I tried C-x SPC but selectio nis a bit lilmited from where I start and to add text to EOL, string-regex is like too restrictive or complicated just to add some text with return etc...
 any idea on how to do that?

                              <span>Is there a way to interactively choose which kind (variable, method, etc.) of candidates I&#x27;m seeing when autocompleting with company? Seems like it would be useful for quickly narrowing the possible candidates.

                              <span>I use evil-respect-visual-line-mode to try to get the evil commands (hjkl, but also yy, dd, etc) to work on visual lines. The navigation works fine in the insert state, but when I switch to normal state, evil goes back to only working with buffer lines.
 Is this behaviour familiar to anyone?
 I managed to fix the navigation problem by getting rid of evil-respect-visual-line-mode and instead doing the following (source):
 (define-key evil-motion-state-map [remap evil-next-line] #&#x27;evil-next-visual-line) 
 (define-key evil-motion-state-map [remap evil-previous-line] #&#x27;evil-previous-visual-line)
 But this only works on navigation, not on yanking, deleting, etc.

In your Agenda view, how do you distinguish between daily/weekly/etc. repeated tasks, which are ok to mark DONE or CANCELLED (even if just to roll forward), and one-time tasks, which require a bit more care?</summary>
                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/tkit87/org_workflow_question_in_your_agenda_view_how_do/">

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>As an emacsian newbie and also with ADHD, I have many tasks which remind me to do daily/weekly/etc. things, jog my memory (poor man&#x27;s Anki), etc. And I sometimes treat or think about my repeated tasks differently than my one-off tasks. In order to differentiate them in Agenda, I have adopted a policy of appending their repetition amount in the headline itself, like this:
 *** TODO Clean/Organize Garage for 10 minutes .+1w SCHEDULED:  Spend at least 10 minutes cleaning up the garage. (I&#x27;ll probably do more, but 10 min minimum.) 
 This makes it clear to me that this is a repeated task. So for example, if the above case is overdue by 3 days, I might just CANCEL the task to get it out of my hair, and let it roll forward to next Sat. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to CANCEL a one-off task. I&#x27;ll let it sit in my Agenda or reschedule it. 
 Do you do something similar? Or is there a more emacsian way to do this? I do use org habits for some things, and they are obviously not an issue because they are clearly differentiated from one-off tasks. I like my system, but it&#x27;s sort of an anti-pattern since it&#x27;s not automated or checked. So I&#x27;d like to know how others deal with this kind of differentiation and interaction with Agenda.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to bring scala property object from my java code. Here&#x27;s what I have
 in scala file
 object Config { def appProps: Properties &#x3D; { 
 val p &#x3D; new Properties() Try( p.load( new FileInputStream(s&quot;${System.getProperty(&quot;CONFIG_HOME&quot;)}/application.properties&quot;) ) ) p } }
 in java
 import ...Config$; ... Config$ config &#x3D; Config$.MODULE$; String minSize &#x3D; config.appProps().getProperty(&quot;cluster.min-size&quot;); 
 in application.properties
 cluster.min-size&#x3D;5 
 I was able to do it in a java way like below
 private Properties properties &#x3D; new Properties(); public String getProp(String propName) { try { String systemProps &#x3D; System.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;); properties.load(new FileInputStream( systemProps + &quot;\\target\\config\\application.properties&quot;)); return (String) properties.get(&quot;cluster.min-size&quot;); } catch (IOException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } return properties; } 
 but I want to do it with scala-java interaction.

 Dear all,
 There were several people who came to the last meetup looking for information about debugging Org mode. The last meetup was rather unhelpful in this regard since we dove into a specific use-case.
 I plan to try once more providing a more general introduction to Org (and Emacs) debugging. Tentatively, I plan to talk about: 1. Running Emacs with clean configuration + latest version of Org 2. Bisecting config to find configuration-related issues 3. Using Emacs profiler and sharing profiler results 4. Answer any questions on the first three topics
 After the introduction, we can continue with interactive debugging if there is anyone experiencing performance (or other) issues with Org and willing to share screen.
 Note that using microphone and/or camera should not be required. Jitsi does have chat.
 The time will be the same: 9pm SG time (4pm Moscow; 8am New York; 1pm London). Sat, Mar 26
 I will post the link to the meeting one hour before the meeting start.

                              <span>So, what I want to do is to solve and organize algorithm problems with org-mode + babel.
 #+begin_example 3 a abc abdef #+end_example #+begin_src python n &#x3D; int(input()) for _ in range(n): word &#x3D; input() print(word) #+end_src 
 The first begin_example part defines an input text file containing test cases.
 I want to redirect this content into stdin of the second begin_src python part, so that the input() function in the code would read the content.
 How can I do this? Are there any options for this? I&#x27;ve searched about this but failed to find one... Please help me!

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a dissertation with org-mode. Each chapter lives in its own org file. I also have an outline.org file which holds the outline of all the chapters. Basically, I&#x27;m wondering whether it&#x27;s possible to use #+INCLUDE to /only/ import the headers from each file (and none of its content), so that my outline.org file can be updated automatically. This seems like it should be possible, but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out. Any help would be appreciated.

find a new buffer/file
 copy and yank one tree to the new buffer, save it
 copy and yank the other tree to the new buffer
 do a M-x ediff-current-file or diff-buffer-with-file. 
 resolve differences in the main org file 
 kill the new buffer and delete the corresponding work file
  
I was just wondering if there were some more direct methods.

 Hey Emacsers,
 How are you doing?
 This post is &quot;pretty&quot; special to me because I can still remember and feel:
  
the first time I discovered Org Speed Keys and,
 the first time I took a look at its implementation.
  
It was two AHA moments, one in my Emacs journey and the other in my Elisp journey.
 I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy it :)

I wanted to traverse an output of the libxml-parse-html-region function, whose output takes the following form (where tag is a symbol, attribute-list is nil or an alist, and any remaining elements in the list are either strings or nodes following the same format):
 (tag attribute-list &amp;rest child-nodes) 
 I would then want to check if there are values in the attribute-list, and if there are to see if the (key . value) pair I&#x27;m looking for exists. If not, I would like to recursively pass through each child-node until I either find my (key . value) pair, or find nothing matching and return nil.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I would like to keep my cursor always in the middle of the screen, even if I&#x27;m writing at the bottom of a buffer. I added the following snippet to my init.el
 (use-package centered-cursor-mode :ensure t :init (global-centered-cursor-mode 1) ) (setq scroll-margin 28) ;; full screen &#x3D; 57 lines (setq-default indicate-empty-lines t) 
 but it doesn&#x27;t work and the cursor is only around 25% of the buffer. see here : https://imgur.com/3glkqEa.png
 (also I assume I should set a hook because I don&#x27;t want to loose 50% of screen space for terminal type buffers)
 Thanks,

                              <span>When I compare two files or buffers in ediff, it compares lines by words (inline differences).
 Is it possible to compare two files by whole lines? Now to show that one line was replaced with another.
 Here&#x27;s what I see now, but I want to see line differences in a way that one line was added, another line was removed, not differences within those lines:

                              <span>Hello. Somehow, my emacs system (version 26.3) is installed under /usr of git bash for windows, e.g., /usr/bin/emacs.exe, /usr/share/emacs, etc. Of course, /usr is actually located at C:\Program Files\Git\usr. Now, I want to update the emacs to version 27.2, but before doing so, I also want to uninstall the older emacs version 26.3. I am not really sure how to uninstall it. Unfortunately, I do not recall how I installed it under /usr area in the first place instead of typical C:\Program Files\Emacs\ area. Thanks for your help!

                              <span>The picture below shows the side scrollbar for a file in another editor.
 Left marks are gutter (git) and right marks are linting errors/warnings.
 Blue line is current line inside the file.
 Scroll thumb shows the visible part.
 I&#x27;ve been experimenting with this editor and it seems a very visual way to navigate in larger files while coding.
 Is there such a thing for emacs? Notice this is not a &quot;minimap&quot;. Although that would be awesome! I dream of the day where sublimity mini-map moves from experimental.

                              <span>From Quarto website
 Quarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc
  
Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
 Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.
 Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
 Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.
  
See Quatro gallery to have a quick look at its potential.
 Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m convinced that org-mode is more powerful and features rich, but the integration made here with Quarto is to me a good example of a powerful and sleek integration of Pandoc and its ecosystem. 
 I still have this feeling that org-mode suffers from a visibility issue, most likely associated with the fact that it&#x27;s only pegged to Emacs (although serious cloning attempts exist: orgmode.nvim or neorg/).
 I find the orgdown initiative very interesting in the sense of opening up org to something other than our beloved Emacs.
 What do you think ? Can we dream of access to org-mode as simple and complete as Quarto for example while benefiting from the same &quot;universality&quot;/popularity of the markdown format, is this vision realistic, attainable ?
 Have fun.

                              <span>Mario Bunge (1919–2020) was an Argentine-Canadian philosopher and physicist. Here are some excerpts from his book Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist (Springer-Verlag, 2016) about his use of card-boxes and about the alleged exploits of a card-pilferer. One guesses from these glimpses that Bunge&#x27;s card-system was not as developed as Luhmann&#x27;s, which is no discredit to Bunge&#x27;s achievements.
Around 1956:
&quot;My next task was to prepare my course. Since none of the textbooks known to me was satisfactory, I resorted to the maieutic method that Plato had attributed to Socrates. My lectures consisted essentially in questions that I distributed beforehand to the students, and an abstract of the research that they had prompted. I wrote each question on a 6 × 8 card.

                              <span>I have been testing out the FFI to transfer code between Haskell and C. 
 I haven&#x27;t seen this example but is it possible to pass a Haskell function to C with the type
 myfunc :: [CDouble] -&gt; [CDouble] ?
 I suspect that directly passing a function on lists is not possible. What about functions on storable vectors?
 myfunc :: SV.Vector Double -&gt; SV.Vector Double ?
 From what I&#x27;ve seen, transforming Haskell functions for C is handled by a &quot;wrapper&quot; function, I&#x27;m not sure what the limits of this conversion are.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been writing a simple GUI app using reactive-banana, and I&#x27;ve run into a problem. The GUI displays one of two meshes: mesh A or mesh B; the user can switch between them by clicking a checkbox. My event network looks like this:
 ---checkbox---+ | -------A------+---AorB---+ | | -------B------+ +---mesh--- | --------drawParams-------+ 
 The problem is that every time I click the checkbox, the mesh now being visualized (either A or B) is regenerated, which takes quite a while. The event network doesn&#x27;t trigger it -- changes A shows no activity -- but a trace in the (pure) generation function shows that the mesh being activated is being regenerated.
 (It used to be worse; before switching with switchB, I was generating AorB with, essentially, liftA3 ifThenElse, which made both of the meshes regenerate every time the checkbox was clicked!)
 I note, however, that merely changing the draw parameters does not result in a rebuilding of the mesh; apparently the value of AorB is cached in some way. Is there a way in reactive-banana to request this behaviour; that is, to tell it to cache the value of some Behavior so it doesn&#x27;t have to recompute it when using it further down the network? Failing that, is there some simple way to do the caching myself? (I can just about see how to do it using IORefs and something like imposeChanges, but a simpler way would be better.)

                              <span>Seems like Haskellers using QuickCheck are the most avid and knowledgable proponents of property testing, so posting this here in /r/Haskell with the hope that y&#x27;all can overlook that my immediate context is Kotlin and not Haskell (my problem and question remains the same)
  
property testing is definitely cool but as much I hate to say it I can&#x27;t really think of many use cases where we would benefit from it in a straightforward way
 intuitively it would be awesome to be able to do eg
 @Property fun &#x60;validate email&#x60;(@ForAll @Email email: String) { val validRequest &#x3D; PatchUserRequest( emailAddress &#x3D; email ) Assertions .assertThat( resourceExtension .validator //this just triggers the validation annotations on the PatchUserRequest .validate(validRequest) ).isEmpty() //empty set of errors }

                              <span>For brief background, I am an experienced programmer, senior year in university. I am going to take a compilers class in a week where they use Haskell to build the compiler. I have some exposure to Haskell before in a prior class but I have forgot most of the stuff. Haskall programming from first principles is too long and verbose and I fall asleep reading it as it seems to be a lot of explanations compared to exercises. I want to get ramped up quick, reviewing some of the material I forgot but also be prepared literally next Monday when the compilers class start. I am looking into reading the lecture notes and doing the exercises from this https://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/spring13/
 as recommended by another post https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3onkc5…

 then reading yet another monad tutorial and call it a day. Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am trying to wrap my head around the Profunctor typeclasses.
 Notably, I am trying to find out why there isn&#x27;t a lot of code around using something like Monoidal/ProductProfuctor and instead there seems to have been a decision to go for Traversing and similar typeclasses.
 I have been looking mostly at this discussion from a couple of years ago that has the following:
  
davemenendez says that you can implement wander using the Monoidal typeclass (which, as far as I can tell, is only true if your profunctor is representable?)
 ekmett says that Monoidal is implemented via Traversing in the profunctors lib (which doesn&#x27;t make sense to me, because I don&#x27;t see how one can write one in terms of the other)
  
There&#x27;s the glassery blog post from Oleg that also mentions Monoidal, but with disappointment because it doesn&#x27;t bring much on top of Choice, if I understand correctly (but I don&#x27;t see e.g. Costar mentioned in the table where this conclusion is reached).
 I have spent a couple of hours trying to implement Monoidal in terms of Traversing and vice-versa and gone nowhere unless I also bring Representable to the table, but there are some good examples for non-representable instances of Monoidal so I don&#x27;t want to do this.
 Either I am missing some cool trick in my bag of tricks or I really don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s happening here.
 Anyone got some illuminating text or notes or something?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have recently learned Haskell and have written some code but I feel like I am just writing pure functions in a procedural and I am not taking advantage of the abstractions offered by Haskell. It is not that I don&#x27;t know about these abstractions it is because I don&#x27;t think about them when I am writing code so my question is do you have any suggestions on how to actually write code that takes complete advantage of Haskell&#x27;s awesomeness? Feel free to point me to any book/articles/videos that talk about this subject. Thanks!
 PS: In order to learn Haskell I have read Learn you a Haskell for great good and Haskell from first principles.

                              <span>After reading LYAH what I&#x27;d love is something like an article to help me make some connections between higher level concepts in haskell, anything to help connect the dots in my brain.
 Any good resources ? 
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m putting it here in case someone finds it interesting and wants to productify it (more testing, polishing, melpa), because I don&#x27;t have the time to finish it.

Other Misc
 
 It might even have some special &quot;current&quot; projects added to the list. Maybe there&#x27;s a feature or package that already does something similar? Or a standard-ish org mode method/recipie to accomplish the same?

                              <span>For some reason my emacs is launching in split screen (horizontal) with the top half being Messages and the bottom half being Fancy Diary. Nothing in my .emacs explains why it is launching in split screen. I also tried killing Messages on launch but it didn&#x27;t work because it just brings in the scratch and Messages buffres on start. Below are the relevant pieces on my .emacs file.
 Diary info:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (setq initial-buffer-choice &#x27;diary-fancy-display-mode)
 ;desktop notifications (require &#x27;notifications)
 (defcustom appt-notification-bus :session &quot;dbus notifications&quot; :version &quot;29.05&quot; :group &#x27;appt-notification :type &#x27;(choice (const :tag &quot;Session bus&quot; :session) string))
 (defun user/appt-display (min-to-app new-time msg) &quot;sends notifications&quot; (notifications-notify :bus appt-notification-bus :title (format &quot;Appointment in %s minutes&quot; min-to-app) :body (format &quot;%s&quot; msg) :replaces-id nil :app-icon notifications-application-icon :timeout 8000 :desktop-entry &quot;diary&quot;))
 (setq appt-disp-window-function (function user/appt-display))

I know the vim bindings for navigation and very basic editing, and have those set up in Visual Studio on my work computer. I&#x27;ve heard about &quot;emacs pinky&quot; and would like to avoid that (cramping is part of why I got into the vim bindings instead of the default Microsoft ones), but I don&#x27;t know if I should go full Evil mode, especially when I&#x27;m not tied to the more advanced vim stuff.
 What&#x27;s your favorite noob starter kit, especially if it simplifies the navigation commands?

 I went ahead and manually downloaded all the packages from melpa and placed them under ~/.emacs.d/elpa. Now, when emacs starts it complains: 
 Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading &#x60;C:/User/myusername/.emacs.d/init.el&#x27;: error: Package &#x60;use-package-&#x27; is unavailable 
 The init.el contains:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) ;; install use-package if not (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package) (package-refresh-contents) (package-install &#x27;use-package)) (eval-when-compile (require &#x27;use-package)) 
 M-x list-packages shows the use-package package is installed. 
 Any idea how to make it work in my environment? FWIW, I&#x27;m running 29.0.50. Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been seeing strange behavior with my Emacs lately, such that it creates a link to a file that has unsaved changes. I have an example shown here. I do have backups disabled using the below lines in my dotfiles:
 (setq backup-inhibited t) (setq auto-save-default nil) 
 However, these only stop the backup files that start with a ~, the kind that I&#x27;m seeing now, I haven&#x27;t been able to find references for it on the web. Any pointers are highly appreciated.

 Awesome. I just tried out gdb and was disappointed with the lackluster information.
 I&#x27;m still on 28.0.50, I guess I&#x27;ll have to upgrade to another WIP version :-).

                              <span>I am working on a new package but I need help because I don&#x27;t really know how to &quot;link&quot; a function to an object. Here is the current structure of my code:
 (defmacro print-first (first) &quot;Print FIRST name.&quot; &#x60;(message ,first)) (defmacro print-full (first last) &quot;Print FIRST and LAST name.&quot; &#x60;(message ,(concat first &quot; &quot; last))) (defun make-pet (first-name last-name) &quot;Create a pet using FIRST-NAME and LAST-NAME.&quot; (make-record &#x27;pet 1 &#x60;(first-name last-name (print-first first-name) (print-full first-name last-name)))) 
 Basically I want a user to be able to define a pet, and my library should be able to generate functions for that pet. In my actual library, some of these functions modify the properties of the pet itself not shown here. Is what I have shown here the best way to do this? Should I be using make-record?
 Also, are there any tips for testing macros? I am reading about how when they are compiled and ran that they behave differently than when evaluated and ran.

                              <span>Whenever I restart emacs, yasnippet looses all the snippets I made, like it doesn&#x27;t know where to look for them. Which is weird because yasnippet makes its own directory itself in .emacs.d. I see on github other people have this issue but I can&#x27;t find a solution. Yesterday I somehow managed to get them back but I can&#x27;t remember what I did. What can I put in my init.el so this stops happening?

                              <span>From: https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#precursor
  
The Precursor is the latest open source hardware project from OSHW wizard Andrew &quot;bunnie&quot; Huang – AKA &quot;the guy who broke the Xbox DRM and is now suing to overturn the DMCA.&quot;
 https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p&#x3D;5921
 It&#x27;s a mobile hardware platform, &quot;a framework upon which you can assemble a wide variety of DIY mobile applications…designed from the ground-up to be carried around in your pocket.&quot;
 &quot;It’s not just a naked circuit board with connectors hanging off at random locations: it comes fully integrated—with a rechargeable battery, a display, and a keyboard—in a sleek, 7.2 mm (quarter-inch) aluminum case.&quot;
 The design is derived from the Betrusted project, an ambitious open source hardware privacyphone initiative that is super cool, but still has a long way to go before it&#x27;s ready for field use.
  
 After digging through the docs, it looks like it uses a Rust-based OS called Xous 
 https://xobs.io/announcing-xous-the-betrusted-operating-system/
 Given that this is a BW graphics device with a hardware keyboard, long battery life, wifi, and fits into your pocket -- this might be the ideal mobile emacs device.
  
I&#x27;m not sure if Emacs will compile on it, and there&#x27;s no X11 or Wayland to speak of, so there will be some roadbumps.

                              <span>So it appears that pdf tools just broke. I don&#x27;t know why. When I lunch emacs i get the following errors:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install pdf-tools: Package ‘pdf-tools-’ is unavailable Error (use-package): pdf-tools/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: pdf-occur-global-minor-mode 
 in my .emacs file i have these lines to configure pdf tools:
 ;; PDF files------------------------------------------------------------- (use-package pdf-tools :pin manual :config (pdf-tools-install) (setq-default pdf-view-display-size &#x27;fit-width); open a pdf in pdf-view mode (define-key pdf-view-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-s&quot;) &#x27;isearch-forward); use isearch :custom (pdf-annot-activate-created-annotations t &quot;automatically annotate highlights&quot;)) 
 I tried M-x package reinstall pdf-tools, but for some reason I can&#x27;t find the pdf-tools package.
 I really don&#x27;t know what happened.
 I use Arch, and i3wm. My version of emacs is 27.2

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering trying non-doom emacs and wanted to see if my rationale makes sense. I really appreciate the work hilsner did making doom btw, I use it constantly
 I mainly use emacs for org mode and some light coding. I do use vim bindings. I&#x27;m on a mac
 With Doom I feel like there is a lot of extra stuff that I don&#x27;t need or understand. I like the idea of building something from scratch that is leaner and fits my needs. Also, if I have a question, it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;s a doom thing or an emacs thing. I would just learn emacs
 Does that make sense high level? Would it be a crazy amount of work to configure it to what I use emacs for now? I&#x27;m willing to do some work to get to a good place, but don&#x27;t want to be stuck fiddling with it forever either. Is there somewhere that would be good to start from?

                              <span>Hey! Org-mode user since a few years and I recently started clocking my tasks. I have seen that I get different date-time formats and also different editing behavior. This probably has a good name (or keyword) that I could google but I don&#x27;t know what what would be.
 First, date-time format can come in (at least) two different &quot;flavors&quot; and I don&#x27;t know what the difference is.
 First one is with [] used as block characters
 CLOCK: [2022-03-21 Mon 11:51]--[2022-03-21 Mon 12:36] &#x3D;&gt; 0:45 
 Second is the same but with  used as block characters
 CLOCK: -- &#x3D;&gt; 0:45 
 I can change between these two different style by putting my cursor on the brackets (either type) and then use S-UP/DOWN to change between them.

                              <span>Hey! I have been working on a simple threading / pipeline library for emacs largely based off a cl library with the same name. For those who don&#x27;t know what that means its basically a way to make deeply nested code into something much easier to read. It can be thought of as analogous to a unix pipe.
 (some (code (that (is (deeply (nested)))))) ;; turns into (arr-&gt; (nested) (deeply) (is) (that) (code) (some)) 
 where the result of the last result is passed in as the first argument of the next.
 There are other variants for different use cases, whether you need to pass it in as the last argument or even if you need arbitrary placements, all can currently be achieved. This is not the end though as there are plans to aggregate a bunch of arrows from different languages, not because its necessarily practical but because its fun!
 here is the github page for it, if people want to use it, if its useful to people ill also post it to (m)elpa
 Feedback and PR&#x27;s are as always appreciated.

 Say you have the same 10 lines of text in a dozen different files. Is there a way to update all instances of that text at once? Can you link to a file but have the description just be the contents of the file that&#x27;s linked?

 I already have poetry.el (with poetry-venv-toggle toggled) and it&#x27;s detecting my poetry project correctly, but pyright does not seem to be cooperating with it.
 Anyone experiencing the same issue?

                              <span>My Emacs (27.1 from Debian 11) is build without xwidget support which means that the in-build browser does not work.
 Is there any other package that makes it possible to see a browser or html renderer in an Emacs buffer? I would like to use that e.g. for Markdown previews etc

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently writing an article in org-mode and use org-cite for my citation needs. I export via LaTeX and have everything working as expected, using biblatex-apa in the background.
 Following APA guidelines, I need to produce a few citations with a prefix that ends in a semicolon, e.g., &quot;... (here is the prefix; Author, 2022).&quot; Unfortunately I can&#x27;t get this to work since the semicolon is used as a delimiter of citations in org-cite (cf. here). Thus I can produce &quot;... (here is the prefix, Author, 2022)&quot; with [cite:here is the prefix, @author2022], but [cite:here is the prefix; @author2022] doesn&#x27;t work.
 As a workaround, I could use LaTeX code (e.g., \autocite[here is the prefix;][]{author2022}) which yields the correct result when used in LaTeX directly. The problem is that the prefixes are mostly acronyms, which I like to put in small capitals, and exporting \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]{author2022} to LaTeX for somehow doesn&#x27;t work (it gets converted to \autocite[\textsc{abc};][]\{author2022\}).
 How can I produce the citation with a prefix that ends in a semicolon? This should be simple, but I can&#x27;t find a solution and it is driving me mad. Any help is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello friends! I have been trying to use emacsclient for my EDITOR environment variable. It works fine except one snag I&#x27;ve encountered. My EDITOR is set to emacsclient -t -a &#x27;&#x27;.
 The issue is this: when I run git commit it launches a new frame in my terminal, as you&#x27;d expect. The issue arises if I choose to cancel my commit using C-c C-k. Canceling the commit returns me to my terminal hanging on the git message &quot;Hint: waiting for your editor to close the file...&quot;. It hangs until I take some other action on my system (taking an action such as spawning a new terminal, opening a new emacsclient, etc).
 If you have any ideas on what may be causing this, or I how I can provide more information, please let me know.

                              <span>As a newbie, it seems a little scary to have your entire life in a text file, freely editable, right in front of you. I know that one can have backups and revisions. But what if you make a mistake? You cut some large chunk of text, then get a phone call while your wife screams because she hurt herself. When you get back to your session, you forget that you cut out that large chunk, but it&#x27;s not obvious that it&#x27;s missing. 
 Or your cat walks on your keyboard while you&#x27;re away, and does some damage to your file? 
 Do you perform a regular review of changes made? 
 Or is this not a concern?

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of shifting my mail clients to Emacs, and have mostly configured the full setup (mbsync+mu4e). Initially, running mbsync -aV would just download all emails from the remote. While this wasn&#x27;t a problem for my work email (a relatively new mailbox), I suspect this would be of a greater issue for my personal gmail as I have thousands of useless/spam/marketing emails which just eats up space. Given the download rate limit from gmail (2.5GB per day) and my limited local drive space, I was wondering if there is any setup in mbsync to only download N number of recent emails, or download emails after a specific year. (I could, alternatively, just cleanup my gmail inbox. Maybe that will be the last option!)

2022 Week 12
Last Week
Onboarding and refactoring &quot;Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021.&quot; My experience working in my ZK with the notes from reading Annie Paul&#x27;s book was basso-profundo. The ideas resonated, and it was easy to rewrite the highlights with my understanding and find relevant links to what was already in my ZK.
Reading &quot;Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson.&quot;
This Week
More reading and onboarding &quot;Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson.&quot;
I&#x27;m most excited about the development of a proximity search tool! While refactoring and deep linking &quot;The Extended Mind,&quot; the near_search.py proved itself. It quickly surfaced surprisingly relevant link candidates that would have taken lots of time and frustration to find.
I want to start on a short video presentation on using citations with The Archive integrating Zotero and Pandoc for perfect Markdown to PDF or Word documents. You can easily cite using any style (CMOS, MLA, APA, IEEE, or whatever) and have the final document outputted in any format you need.

                              <span>This [YouTube video] illustrates one way of implementing a digital Zettelkasten with Obsidian.  My comments follow.
Note identifiers are avoided altogether in favor of descriptive filenames. This obviates the timestamp versus Folgezettel question. A tradeoff is that note filenames should be unique and should be considered immutable: a title cannot be changed without changing each reference to the note with that title. This seems like a minor inconvenience, in view of the use of backlinks to create indexes and hubs, below.


Bibliographic entries (literature notes) are separate notes that link to a note titled Bibliography.  The choice of writing bibliographic entries within Obsidian (the slip box component of the Zettelkasten) seems less efficient than working with a reference manager such…</span>

                              <span>Maybe somebody here can help me out...
 How can I configure TCP keep alive parameters per-socket, specifically TCP_KEEPCNT, TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL? This is based on this doc for context.
 network library exposes SO_KEEPALIVE parameter that as I understand enables/disables it, but not the three parameters above? Even with that parameter, when I print its value after setting it to 1 in the client I get 64 and in the server I get 8 – so I am not sure if I am setting it correctly...
 There is also keep-alive library that seems to allow configuring TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL per socket, but it doesn&#x27;t compile on Mac.
 I would really appreciate any suggestions here - thank you!

                              <span>I understand that this might come across as rude, and I apologise in advance if it does, but is anyone able to give me some rationale for why the Yesod forms API is the way it is? It seems to me to be incredibly overcomplicated. There&#x27;s a mess of boilerplate, what with creating a data type and generating a widget from it, even if you need all of two fields, as in the case of a login form. In particular, controlling the layout and appearance of the form seems to be extremely cumbersome. The applicative API seems basically useless, given that you don&#x27;t have any control over appearance - as soon as you want to do something as simple as tweak the label font size you have to drop to the monadic API.
 I&#x27;m coming from Flask here, so my reference point that you just write your form in a jinja2 template, in which you have full and straightforward control over the form&#x27;s layout and appearance, then you access the form data from a request like so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; @app.route(&quot;/login&quot;, methods&#x3D;(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;)) def login(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Log in a registered user by adding the user id to the session.&quot;&quot;&quot; if request.method &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;POST&quot;: username &#x3D; request.form[&quot;username&quot;] password &#x3D; request.form[&quot;password&quot;]
  # do things with username and password 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Why not have something similar in Yesod, simply write the form as a Hamlet widget, and access the form data by name, instead of all this stuff with creating a datatype and generating the widget from it using generateFormPost and runFormPost? I&#x27;m new to Yesod, so I understand I&#x27;m probably missing a lot of information. But I don&#x27;t think I require much expertise to state that I&#x27;m finding the API pretty unpleasant to use.

                              <span>I&#x27;m making an ODE solver using Runge-Kutta. Implementing with lists is pretty easy but I was wondering if lists are the best container to be using.
 ODE&#x27;s solved in this way start with an initial condition and are solved by advancing by a time-step (if time is the relevant parameter) based on the current state. This is nicely solved using the iterate function. 
 I was initially planning on switching to a vector type or similar, but maybe that is not necessary?
 Any thoughts on if it&#x27;s worth trying different container types?

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m a mentor for FIRST Robotics Competition. I want to transition my team of novice high-school students from Java.
 EDIT: I shouldn&#x27;t have assumed that people would just be familiar with FIRST... I&#x27;ve had a few questions asking exactly what I my use case is. Essentially, students are given 8 weeks to build a robot for a competition. We aren&#x27;t told the rules in advance, so everyone has the same 8 week period to design, build, and program the robot.
 However, off-season teams tend to do things like write general purpose code (e.g., movement) or streamline processes, make practice robots, etc.
 The library used in the competition (optional; teams can also create low level code from scratch, but almost nobody does) is called WPILIB. It&#x27;s primarily a Java and C++ framework, which you can read about here.
 I recently became an F# evangelist and found that functional programming has greatly reduced the fragility of my code by way of ensuring a correct data model.
 I am looking to move our team to possibly using Spring and definitely using Scala or Kotlin.
 One of my fellow mentors has suggested that object oriented design is easier to reason with in the case of a robot, and suggested Kotlin as our next language.
 I suggested that functional programming can definitely be used to model a Robotics systems and ensure that invalid states are explicitly rejected while making the program easier to debug and test.
 Regardless of which language we pick, everyone will be learning it (and Spring) from scratch. 
 What are your thoughts? Which language will better suit what we&#x27;re trying to do?
 EDIT 2: We have decided on Kotlin for the main application code for now, but if Scala makes more sense for certain use cases (e.g., programming autonomous mode functions) we will be open to writing those modules in Scala. I still welcome any discussions.

                              <span>I can easily find good and extensive resources about about everything: functional programming, design patterns, libraries/frameworks, whatever it is.
 However, I can&#x27;t seem to find anything that goes beyond the introductory level when it comes to concurrency stuff.
 I want to understand how threads work, what exactly a ExecutionContext does, what the heck is a Semaphore and a IORef?
 Is there anything that teaches me, from the very beginning, threads? Perhaps not why they exist (I know that), but what are their consequences, and how do we go about alleviating those consequences?
 The only extensive resource I could find is the book &quot;Java Threads&quot;, which seems to be outdated, but I could be wrong.
 How did you learn all that stuff? Thanks.

 I can&#x27;t find any scala related error by searching.
 I have the following error.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 there were 2 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I search &quot;re-run with -deprecation for details scala&quot; on internet. nothing comes up. 
 ​
 I have no clue how to figure out where the error come from. 
 I can&#x27;t seem to find anything related to scala by searching google. 
 For example, converting number base like from base 2 to base 10.
 ​
 I am reading a book on scala right now, so if I have encounter the material in the book before, I may be lucky and find answer there.
 ​
 I also search scala api document. 
 ​
 How can I search for error related to scala language? 
 I can&#x27;t seem to find anything by searching google, search from books, search scala api.
 What am I missing?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know how often this particular situation comes up in other contexts, but when working with GHC and trying to print the Haskell expression ASTs it produces, I&#x27;ve run into a problem:
 They don&#x27;t have a Show instance.
 Now, I expect you&#x27;ll say &quot;But /u/NNOTM&quot;, just add a standalone deriving instance!&quot;
 I thought the same. However, it&#x27;s such a complex graph of dependencies involving type families and similar that I gave up after 20 minutes of trying to add deriving instances for some types and finding workarounds for others where that&#x27;s not possible.
 There&#x27;s also the excellent recover-rtti library and its anythingToString function, but I couldn&#x27;t use it here since it wasn&#x27;t compatible with the version of GHC I was using.
 Conveniently, however, GHC&#x27;s expressions do have Data instances,…</span>

                              <span>In Haskell all the Comonads (at least the ones defined in the comonads package) are duals of transformers Monad Transformers. This is taken by changing the occurrence of the “state parameter” from positive to negative occurrence ((,) s  (-&gt;) s). 
 For example (in pseudocode)
 —- m is Monad, w is Comonad —- Writer and Co-writer WriterT s m a ~ m ((,) s a) TracedT s w a ~ w ((-&gt;) s a) —- Reader and Co-reader ReaderT s m a ~ (-&gt;) s (m a) EnvT s w a ~ (,) s (w a) —- State and Co-State StateT s m a ~ (-&gt;) s (m ((,) s a)) StoreT s w a ~ (,) s (w ((-&gt;) s a)) 
 However this is also a pretty restricted notion of duality. I wanted to know if there is a more intuition as to why this is the case, and then to what the dual of something like MaybeT, SelectT, and ContT (or is there?). Or why (-&gt;) and (,) are duals (because one is the exponential, and the other is the product); why aren’t the duals Either and (,)?
 MaybeT m a ~ m (Maybe a) ~ m (1 + a) CoMaybeT w a ~ w (Void, a) ~ w (0 * a) —- Note that CoMaybeT is uninhabited when w is a Comonad

                              <span>My build process has become somewhat stable. After each run the scripts upload everything (binaries produced and scripts used) here:
 https://corwin.bru.st/emacs-28
 In addition to what gets posted to the alpha FTP site, the scripts make and upload &quot;NATIVE_FULL_AOT&quot; versions (from the emacs-28 and master branches, currently).
 If you aren&#x27;t familiar, passing NATIVE_FULL_AOT&#x3D;1 to make triggers full ahead-of-time native elisp compilation. In the case of Windows builds, this means the build will include DLLs for most/all elisp sources distributed with Emacs. These DLLs can be used without additional pre-requisites apart from what is included in emacs-.zip (or emacs--installer.exe). This is useful when you can&#x27;t --don&#x27;t want-- to put GCC/libgccjit on a Windows system where you use Emacs.
 Thanks much for all of the help testing out the builds I&#x27;ve been making and in advance for your feedback on the AOT versions.

I&#x27;ve been using emacs (doom and evil mode) for about a year now, and am just getting to the point where I feel like I&#x27;m beginning to understand (enough) of it to be useful. I suspect I can do what I want, but haven&#x27;t found the magic combination yet. I&#x27;m hoping that someone more experienced can point me in the right direction.
 My current problem: I have a large text buffer (Beancount text based accounting file -- 3mb+), where I wish to change *some* entries to re-categorize expenses, based on the contents of the previous line or two. I need to change anywhere from 1 up to maybe 200 entries at a time (out of maybe 30,000 entries.) Usually too many to do manually, but there are enough variations in the transactions that I&#x27;m matching against that blindly doing a global regexp/repla…</span>

                              <span>After I updated Emacs to 27.2-2 on Arch Linux I am no longer able to update packages. Same config as before that worked perfectly.
 On *Packages* buffer (list-packages), when I press U to update packages, I get message &quot;Waiting for refresh to finish...&quot; and it never finishes.
 There are no errors in *Messages* buffer. I reinstalled Emacs, tried putting only part of my config, always the same result. Even emacs -Q does the same thing.
 I am lost, where do I even try to look to find the issue?

  -------------------- Start of forwarded message --------------------   
 and
   -------------------- End of forwarded message -------------------- 
 It it unclear to me where I should include my message to the forwarded email. I tried adding it before and after this text, but my text does not actually show up on all email clients of my recipients (for example Gmail).
 This style of forwarding is different from what I am used. I came from mu4e and other email clients where an email is usually quoted (as it would have been for a reply) and then I usually top-post my additional message.
 How do I correctly forward a message in notmuch? Is there a way to have a more &quot;traditional&quot; forwarding format which uses the same format as when replying (with a different message subject)?

 It seems that this is a mode is &quot;global&quot; and there is no way to restrict this mode to python buffers only. I don&#x27;t understand the details but somebody explained it here on emacs.stackexchange.
 So the question is if there is another package or solution to have something like this (prefered in the headline) but in Python buffers only.
 I read about some lsp-mode depended solutions. The problem here is that I use eglot instead of lsp-mode and won&#x27;t change that.

                              <span>I recently swapped from Ivy and Flyspell to Vertico and Spell-fu. Now, whenever I try to correct the spelling of a word with ispell-word, instead of having the possible choices appear through Vertico, they appear in a pop up window at the top of the screen, and I can press a number to select the desired word. 
 I think it should be possible to integrate the spelling completions into Vertico - I know that Doom Emacs does this. Does anyone know how to set this up correctly? I was recommended the &quot;spell-correct&quot; package, but I can&#x27;t find it.

 And I just now finished setting up and did C-c C-worg-refile a bunch of trees to another file.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve started a new job writing lisp, and using emacs as the default environment. I&#x27;m still learning the editor (and the language), but the part I&#x27;m having the most trouble adapting to is C-z C-x C-c C-v commands that are standard with Windows. Given that I&#x27;ve used those commands since I&#x27;ve used computers in general, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be easy to switch over.
 I&#x27;ve seen that there is a mode that sort of removes that possibility, CUA mode, but it seems like it would interfere with most of the slime commands. C-c and C-x seem to be very busy keys.
 And so I have thought of a solution that I think would work, and it&#x27;s crackpot enough that I think trying it will be fun. I&#x27;m not completely sure it will work, and so am requesting community input.
 OK, so here&#x27;s the plan. I&#x27;m going to de-mothball my custom keyboard which allows me to remap keys. Then I would remap the Caps-Lock key to one of the F13-F24 keys, and then using that as the Control for emacs sequences. C-c would be (Caps lock)-c and C-x would be (Caps lock)-x. I think that&#x27;s possible to change in my init file? Emacs has proven to be a remarkable beast in its extensibility and I&#x27;m like 90% sure that this is doable.
 Anyway, I am wondering if there is some obvious problem with this plan, other than the glaringly obvious one which is that it&#x27;s less trouble to just learn the shortcuts. (What&#x27;s the fun in that, though?)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been throwing together bits of elisp over the past few months and it&#x27;s sort of turned into a tiny little major mode for Typescript (and Javascript) webapp files: https://github.com/orzechowskid/tsx-mode.el
 indentation and jit-lock syntax highlighting are powered by tree-sitter, and code analysis and completion are powered by lsp-mode. servers and grammars for both should be automatically installed and configured for you. tagged template strings for some common CSS-in-JS patterns are indented and support code-folding, and have CSS syntax highlighting and completion applied to them when point is inside of them.
 I&#x27;ve been using this at work and at home for a while now and am very pleased with it. but I&#x27;m positive there are hidden assumptions it makes and/or failures in handling use-cases which I personally don&#x27;t have, so I&#x27;d love to get extra eyes on it to see where it can improve. comments (or PRs!) are very welcome.
 thanks for looking!

                              <span>In short - Decades with Emacs but have only used org for recording notes, snippets, ideas.. never for tasks. Okay writing elisp just always used a simple checklists in whatever pocketable devices I had at the time. Random youtubes or org-mode pages tends to show simple agenda view but what I _think_ I&#x27;m looking for is more complex and I&#x27;m not sure org-agenda/etc can do it as is? (Presumably there are org query APIs I could hijack and make my own major mode viewer, but trying to reduce TODOs not add more ;)
 With hundreds of to-dos, perhaps org-mode/agenda/whatever can save me? The rate of adding to-dos exceeds the rate of completing them sadly :)
 Ideally plainorg or beorg can render it as well.
 Current Workflow:
 - many are dated to-do&#x27;s - the date by which I&#x27;d like to see them
 - many are undated, but tagged (home, work, cycling, etc etc) and/or prioritized (high, medium, someday, etc)
 What I&#x27;d like to see is a single view including (in order):
 (by default, ignore tags; but be nice if the below could also be filtered down to 1 or more tags as well)
 - dated yet unfinished tasks for today
 - tasks that are pass due (dated for yesterday or earlier, and not checked off)
 - tasks that are undated, sorted by priority (descending)
 I don&#x27;t want to have to cycle views for this, which is the trick; every to-do system in the planet can let you show upcoming or late to-dos, or the ones by tag, or the undated ones. I want the combined single view, so can glance and go.
 Most to-do applications (such as Apple Reminders) let you create smart lists that you pick very specific criteria, without OR functionality; so date for tomorrow, but not date for tomorrow+undated; a specific priority, but no sort by priority after picking two priorities say, that sort of thing.

                              <span>check-parens is of course a very useful tool, but has two problems for me. 1. it also checks parens in comments which is not very useful and 2. one cannot skip over a detected mismatch to the next one. This means I get stuck &#x27;fixing&#x27; parens that won&#x27;t need to be fixed and even disrupts my comments.
 Is there a solution, perhaps to just check a region instead of the whole buffer?

                              <span>I have two machines running with Debian 11 and sharing exactly the same init.el.
 But when they open the same py-file Emacs/eglot shows me a extrem different number of linter warnings.
 I am not sure how the components in the background work together. How can I go on with diagnosis here to find out where the difference is. The init.el is the same, so both use the same python-mode (emacs in build) and eglot.

                              <span>Currently, I am trying to choose a tiling window manager for day to day work -- programming, academic writing, video conferencing and the like while working on a mono- or multi-display setup running Debian. I&#x27;m wondering how popular EXWM actually is within the group of Emacs users compared to i3, dwm, xmonad and others. 
  
What are factors to consider, when choosing EXWM vs. any other tiling WM? 
 Would you tell me which tiling WM you use and why? 
  
Thanks already in advance for sharing your experience.

                              <span>I do use use-package but for a lot of packages there is not install and config instructions for it.
 This is my working configuration which I have some questions about.
  
The eglot start (via eglot-ensure) is configured in the (use-package python-mode block via a :hook. Python modes starts eglot. Is this a good solution? 
 company start is configured via a :hook in (use-package company block and starts when eglot comes up.
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacslisp ; .... ; language server (replacement for lsp-mode) (use-package eglot)
 (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) ; connect to language server when py-file is opened :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) )
 (use-package company :after eglot ; this line alone does not help to start company :hook (eglot-managed-mode . company-mode) ; starts company when eglot is started )
 (use-package company-box :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 ; ..... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have some more examples; e.g. the ws-buttler. Do I start it that way?  (use-package ws-butler :init (progn (add-hock &#x27;python-mode-hook &#x27;ws-butler-mode))) 
 Or with a :hook where I do not know what I have to write there.  (use-package ws-butler :hook ?????? 
 Or should I use the python-mode?  (use-package python-mode :ensure nil ; makes sure that Emacs in-build python-mode is used :hook (python-mode . ws-butler-mode) 
 On important point is that e.g. ws-butler-mode should not only start when a Python buffer is opened. It should only work in that Python buffers and not in others after it is started.
 As a newbie it is very hard to decide which configuration ways I should use to start a mode. Should the mode install itself in via a hook to another mode (python)? Should the other mode (python) start it? etc etc

                              <span>Hi.
 Very long-time emacs user but not a programmer (ASIC engineer - mostly working with SystemVerilog, Python, BASH, and TCL) so I can only go so far with emacs-lisp. Running 27.2 and I use ibuffer with ibuffer-formats and ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to organize all my types of files and directories I&#x27;m working on. I want a column that contains the directory paths to the buffers&#x27; files. I want this so I can display it with ibuffer-formats and filter on it in ibuffer-saved-filter-groups to keep track of files with the same name but for different projects.
 I&#x27;ve defined a couple of simple columns but can&#x27;t figure out how to do this for path. I looked at the standard ones in ibuffer.el like filename but the code is a bit beyond my pay grade. I&#x27;d really appreciate any help or pointers for this. Some day I&#x27;ll have time to become an emacs-lisp guru, but that time, unfortunately, is not now.
 Thanks!

                              <span>As a voluntary exercise I try to implement van Laarhoven lenses, prisms, traversals, folds and isos. For me, it’s all very abstract, but I feel like I’m making slow progress. Sometimes the intuition doesn’t work for me, then I try to let me guide by the types. When implementing toListOf I get stuck because “type tetris” doesn’t help anymore:
 They start with
 toListOf :: Traversal s s a a -&gt; (s -&gt; [a]) 
 where a Traversal s t a b s is a function
 forall f. Applicative f &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; (s -&gt; f t) 
 Then, they generalize Traversal s s a a to
 (a -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) a) -&gt; (s -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) s) 
 and this is the resulting function I try to implement:
 toListOf :: ((a -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) a) -&gt; (s -&gt; Const (Endo [a]) s)) -&gt; (s -&gt; [a]) toListOf t x &#x3D; undefined

 I tried to use the Equality Package for that, because I saw that it works very good with GADTS, but I couldn&#x27;t get it work with a tagless style.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Alright, so for my own personal education I&#x27;m trying to figure out how applicatives relate to effects outside of monads.
 My interpretation of an effect is something which changes the data structure, but is not affected by fmap
 The solution I came up with was to put the effect data as part of the &quot;main&quot; constructor, and the effect action as a union&#x27;d constructor. Thing is this type error is messing with me, and I&#x27;m not sure how to resolve it. First of all, is my interpretation of what an effect is wrong? Secondly, why is Counter a /&#x3D; Counter b in this error message? They&#x27;re both generic, so why is it having trouble with a &#x3D; b?

                              <span>Hi guys! 
 I was wondering how do you prepare for technical interview? I&#x27;m not asking only about coding part- here you need to practice solving puzzles, implementing different types of algorithms. But in general, what topics do you review? Do you have any sets of your questions that are most likely to be asked? Scala, functional programming, general knowledge of compute science?

If you wish your projects in org-mode will have all the files you need associated with them, in a nice way so you can find it with or without Emacs org-mode... or if you just like to seat back and *enjoy* the way your folders are organized on your computer... 
 Give this one a read. This is a game changer for me, to be sure :)
 Hope you enjoy!

                              <span>I am trying to configure org-super-agenda and have it all working the way I want, except for one bit. I want to show the time-grid and items that are due today at the top of the agenda. For some reason, instead of showing today, it always shows the items for three days ago. So, the image here is from running the agenda on Friday 18 March, but it shows items for Tuesday 15 March. 
 Here is the code used to create this:
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;o&quot; &quot;Overview&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;((:name &quot;Today&quot; :time-grid t :date today :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :scheduled today :order 1))))))))) 
 I must be doing something wrong, but am not sure what it is. Can anyone explain what I am doing wrong?
 Showing details for wrong date

I don&#x27;t really know if I turn this into a package or not, but might be usefull for someone and please if you know more about elisp, submit some PRs and give ideas.
 Disclaimer: Org to pdf export might not be working because I&#x27;m still trying to come with an proper way to do that.

                              <span>One thing I do a lot personally is editing and running python project in remote servers, which almost always come with their own condo environments. I&#x27;m currently trying to do this in emacs with python-mode, lsp-mode and conda-mode. The command conda-activate works perfectly with lsp on my local machine, but when using tramp, it seems that the same command can only select environments from my local conda, no the remote one.
 Is there a way around this? Or is this unavoidable?
 Before getting into emacs, I used vim. Keeping a copy of vim in remote server was easy enough and access through ssh works nicely. If it&#x27;s impossible to use conda environments on remote, is it possible to create some type of emacs client on remote and run something like graphic ssh?

                              <span>I have moved to use Straight.el, everything worked great. I even tried to copy my config into another device, opened Emacs, Straight downloaded all packages automatically and Emacs there worked great too! 
 Then, I noticed that on the other device there is no elpa folder inside .emacs.d, I thought this makes sense as I don&#x27;t use it anymore and disable it by putting (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) inside early-init.el. So I deleted the elpa folder, restarted emacs but now emacsclient -c tries to create a new frame but it gets crashed instantly without any error message. Restoring elpa folder solves the issue!
 There is no mention to elpa folder in my configs.
 How could I debug the issue?

                              <span>So, one evening I was messing around trying to find a suitable compositor to switch from EXWM to , but found nothing really appealing. However, I&#x27;ve stumbled upon Cage and I&#x27;ve got a curious question - will it suffice as a Wayland bootloader for an EXWM session with XWayland turned on? I&#x27;m sorry if all of this sounds cryptic, I was just wondering whether anyone tried to do the same (e. g. launching an EXWM session withing a Wayland kiosk). INB4 any experiences and input are appreciated!

It looks like there are a few packages that do that, but before I start diving into each one I wanted to check with the community and see if there&#x27;s an obvious winner/any packages that I shouldn&#x27;t waste my time with.
 EDIT: Wow, yeah, I really hadn&#x27;t considered just creating and not saving a buffer. Chalk that up to me making things more complicated than they need to be. Thanks all.

                              <span>Hi folks. I have an org file in my .emacs.d folder, this file contains my config separated by org-bullet into different sections. In my other init.el file, it loads this org file and untangle it. 
 The problem is my config, the org file, has a lot of sections. If I dont want to use a section, I have to manually open the org file then go to the specfific bullet and do :noexport. 
 I am looking to implement some sort of menu that pops up on startup and allows you to choose whichever config you want. For example, I can choose &quot;Essential&quot; and only config under the &quot;Essential&quot; bullet gets loaded. 
 Is this possible? Looking for some pointers, any help is appreciated.

 I found this piece of code somewhere on the internet, which works:
 (mapc (lambda (face) (set-face-attribute face nil :height 170)) (face-list)) 
 However, placing this in my .emacs is not effective. I have to evaluate the above expression after starting emacs each time. Is there a way to do this automatically?
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                              <span>Hi,
 My Emacs regularly drives CPU usage to 100%.
 After some searching I ran a profiler report and it seems that Helm is using lots of resources. Am I interpreting this correctly?
 These are all entries 40% or over:
 - command-execute 1625 70% - call-interactively 1623 70% - funcall-interactively 1580 68% - helm-bibtex 1077 46% - helm 1041 45% - apply 1041 45% - helm 1041 45% - apply 1041 45% - helm-internal 1041 45% - helm-read-from-minibuffer 1039 45% - read-from-minibuffer 961 41% 
 If this is the case, how can I stop this from happening?

                              <span>Been using &#x27;macs for years. It still continues to pleasantly surprise. I discovered the message-caesar-buffer-body which by default shifts forward 13 places. Naturally, I wrote a hydra,
 lisp (use-package message :ensure hydra :after hydra :config (defhydra hydra-caesar () &quot;Caesar Cipher&quot; (&quot;f&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (message-caesar-buffer-body 1)) &quot;Shift Forward&quot;) (&quot;b&quot; (lambda () (interactive) (message-caesar-buffer-body -1)) &quot;Shift Backward&quot;)) (hydra-set-property &#x27;hydra-caesar :verbosity 1)) 
 Let&#x27;s see who can decrypt this,
  
Dozdbv uhphpehu wkdw wr dujxh, dqg zlq, lv wr euhdn grzq wkh uhdolwb ri wkh shuvrq brx duh dujxlqj djdlqvw. Lw lv sdlqixo wr orvh brxu uhdolwb, vr eh nlqg, hyhq li brx duh uljkw. - Kduxnl Pxudndpl
  
Now, there there. For the uninitiated, this is ancient encryption breakable by pen and paper in 2 minutes. Note that I did not provide a key to the cipher above and yet people will be coming up with the plaintext. Read more here.

                              <span>Hi all, learning FP and Haskell.
 I&#x27;m confused by the claim that FP is about programming the &quot;what&quot; and not the &quot;how&quot; (see 2nd paragraph in wiki). How could you possibly write a computer program without telling the computer what to do (the how)?
 The closest answer I&#x27;ve gathered is that FP is essentially about term rewriting systems (using beta reduction in particular). A rewriting step is analogous to a state transition step in turing machines. So then that means the compiler handles all the control flow for you, rather than FP somehow magically eliminating the need for control flow and other imperative ideas.
 Is this understanding correct? What am I missing?

 This python function is a simple recursive function with an if statement with multiple nested if statements within it. 
 The problem is when I converted this code to haskell I used guards and it&#x27;s very much unreadable. Just to give as an example, this is one of my guards:
 | indexTxt &lt; length txt &amp;&amp; pat !! indexPat &#x3D;&#x3D; txt !! indexTxt &amp;&amp; (indexPat + 1) &#x3D;&#x3D; length pat &#x3D; findPat txt pat (indexTxt + 1) (calcPrefix pat 1 0 [] !! indexPat + 1) (mIndexes ++ [(indexTxt + 1) - (indexPat + 1)]) 
 It doesn&#x27;t even fit on the screen as you can see.
 Is there any way to make my function more readable? I imagine I need to find some other way to makes this code more readable and preferably smaller, but I have no idea what my options are.
 Any help/tips/guidance would be appreciated.

 When I use org-ref-insert-link fuzzy matching is on. I can turn it off using M-r, but I&#x27;d like it to be off by default. I managed to do this for swiper, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to do the same for org-ref-insert-link. Here&#x27;s what I tried now:
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;ivy (push (cons #&#x27;swiper (cdr (assq t ivy-re-builders-alist))) ivy-re-builders-alist) (push (cons #&#x27;org-ref-insert-link (cdr (assq t ivy-re-builders-alist))) ivy-re-builders-alist) (push (cons t #&#x27;ivy--regex-fuzzy) ivy-re-builders-alist)) 
 I have the feeling I&#x27;m referring to the wrong thing here?

 I&#x27;ve been an emacs user since around 1981. My .emacs still has some snippets from those days. I&#x27;ve used org-mode for literate multi-language programming and went through a phase some years ago where I used it for task tracking, but it was never quite satisfying. 
 I&#x27;ve been journaling and taking notes (personal and work) since the &#x27;90s, for about the last decade on OneNote. It&#x27;s got excellent sync (win/mac/android/web), a word-processor-like UI, and fast, accurate search. But a few things finally made me switch away: totally vendor-locked-in data format (the big one), lack of easy tagging and links, and no proper source blocks - as a software dev, I felt that every day.
 So a few months ago I switched to logseq: it promises Markdown and/or org-mode …</span>

                              <span>Hello, I defined the following settings for the org-latex-title-command in my init.el:
 :custom (org-latex-compiler &quot;xelatex&quot;) (org-latex-title-command (concat &quot;\\begin{titlepage}\n&quot; &quot;\\centering\n&quot; &quot;\\vskip 2em\n&quot; &quot;{\\Huge\\bfseries{%t} \\par}\n&quot; &quot;\\vskip 2em\n&quot; &quot;{\\large %a \\par}\n&quot; &quot;\\vpskip 2em\n&quot; &quot;{\\large %D \\par}\n&quot; &quot;\\end{titlepage}\n&quot;)) ... 
 The &quot;title&quot; of the document and the &quot;author&quot; are shown correctly in the exported PDF, however the &quot;date&quot; shows up like this gibberish:
 Document Title Author Name ((timestamp (:type active :raw-value  :year-start 2022 :month-start 3 :day-start 17 :hour-start nil :minute-start nil :year-end 2022 :month-end 3 :day-end 17 :hour-end nil :minute-end nil :begin 1 :end 17 :post-blank 0 :parent 0))) 
 In the org file, which I export, the date is specified correctly using the C-c ., like so:
 #+TITLE: Document Title #+AUTHOR: Author Name #+DATE:  
 I would like to have the date shown up as &quot;March 17, 2022&quot; in the exported PDF instead of that long ((timestamp .. string.

 I have started practicing the scala from few days. But Im not clear how to continue, there&#x27;s no proper plan to go about it.
 Can anyone please help me in this?Any resources, blogs etc.
 Also, if I can start any side projects. ( Im data engineer, I would like to learn scala FP for handling data )

                              <span>When I work in type language, I spend half the time figure out create &quot;placeholder&quot; for variables to be a particular type such that I can test certain hypothesis about what goes wrong.
 I don&#x27;t think this is the right approach. Because It seems that changing &quot;placeholder&quot; for every hypothesis is extremely inefficient. There should be a better way.
 Can anyone suggest a way that I can think in &quot;type language&quot; way? 
 To give a more concrete example, consider the following scenario. 
 say you are using scala, you want to test a function for a case that only return int (maybe the function that you want to use only return int type.), but the function ultimattely accepts generic type. To test this function that return int in typed language, I have to always change signature to always fit my &quot;testing hypothesis&quot; that only care about int. I think you should get an idea now. because one need to change signature when testing certain hypothesis, I don&#x27;t think it is a sufficient strategy. There must be a better way. Any idea? or debugging technique you use in this scenario.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if it is a right place to ask. But I&#x27;ve checked the rule it seems not prohibiting such topic.
 I&#x27;m from an autocracy country and due to strong opposition of the ideology and pessimism of its prospect in the future decades, I hope to immigrate to a western country to start over a new life.
 I have been working as a data engineer for about six years. And at present, I&#x27;m working for a foreign-invested company, using Scala as my working language writing Spark code, complicated UDFs, etc. However there seem not have a movement of people from global and my local company.
 My second language is English. In addition, I started a family in my native country and have two girls aged 4 and 1.
 I want to ask, if to become an immigrant to an English speaking country, what should be my next move? Should I apply for a Scala job remotely and then go abroad to work? Thank you so much.

                              <span>Hi, I am new to Zettelkasten method and trying to evaluate the format of the notes for myself. It will be for note-taking digitally.
Most software adds datetime to the beginning of the file name. It looks tidy. But a series of numbers means a little to human. If I browse through the file names in a small window of a file manager, I can only see the digits without meaningful titles.
The advantages of placing datetime to the beginning of file names is tidy and sortable. I think.
Any thought from you is appreciated. Do you think it is a good idea to append the datetime after, what is the pros and cons?</span>

                              <span>As a part of Tweag’s ongoing effort to add
WebAssembly code generation GHC, we need to compile GHC’s runtime
system to WebAssembly. The libffi library to pure
WebAssembly is an essential dependency of the GHC runtime: it is used
to pass Haskell functions as callback to C functions. As the
implementation of libffi depends on the platform, we’ve had to port
it to WebAssembly.
This blog post introduces libffi, the challenges to make it
work with WebAssembly, demonstrates our implementation, and also
explains how it’s used by GHC runtime. I hope our implementation can
be useful for other people porting projects to WebAssembly (especially
wasm32-wasi).

What libffi is about
libffi is a C library that provides an interface to perform indirect
function calls, where the function’s type signature i…</span>

                              <span>Hi! 
 I have the following workflow:
 I put all my papers in the folder /papers/some.pdf.
 To not loose track, I also create a todo in my /toread.org which links to file:./papers/some.pdf and some more notes.
 When I finally have time to read this paper, I copy the todo (from toread.org) using (org-copy-subtree) and then (org-yank) it in a newly created file /summaries/somepapernotes.org
 The problem is that the link to file:./papers/some.pdf won&#x27;t work in /summaries/somepapernotes.org. It will point to /summaries/papers/some.pdf which doesn&#x27;t exist. So I have to manually edit the link to file:../papers/some.pdf
 This manual step is annoying the deeper the hierarchy is. Is there a better way which adjusts the relative links automatically when I move subtrees up and down the hierarchy?

 I am using org-ref-url-html-to-bibtexto append a bibtex entry to my bib file using a URL. What I also would like is to generate a hyperlink from URL with the text corresponding to the main title in the URL link (I am a researcher and would use such a function for my to-read list of publications in org mode, at the moment I create each hyperlink manually). Do you know if that exists anywhere, of it is even possible to get stable results from such a function?
 ​
 Thank you a lot in advance!

I tried fancy battery but it seems like they get their battery levels from the built in battery package, so it&#x27;s still wrong.
 ​
 Edit:
 I can get the battery level with the code below but the output looks kinda bad.
 (setq battery-level &quot;more /sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity&quot;)
 (shell-command-to-string battery-level)
 ​
 Output is
 /sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity

                              <span>Hello, i have a problem with lsp workspaces
 im using Doom Emacs, already asked in the help section in discord, sadly no answer received :(
 my lsp-workspaces folders list in like lsp-workspace-folders-switch resets to my home directory after restarting emacs. So that only my home directory is recognized as a workspace folder.
 But I don&#x27;t want to have my home directory as a lsp-workspace-folder. I only want to have the specific project directories as workspace folders.Well, it still works fine when I delete the home directory via lsp-workspace-folders-removeand reopen the project directory and interactively select the directory. But after restarting emacs it just resets it to my home directory
 Does anyone have any idea what the reason is or how to fix this?Any ideas are appreciated.
 Thank you for your help

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to query for a message given the value of a header, say &quot;HEADER-NAME: value&quot; that is part of the source code of the message. 
 Is there a way to do so? If so, what is your workflow and could you provide some example queries? I have tried the following query keywords: embed, body.

 I have elfeed set up so that if I press &quot;w&quot; feeds open in eww and if I press &quot;b&quot; feeds open in lynx. I can select multiple posts, press &quot;b&quot; and go thru them one at a time in lynx. However if I try to do the same thing in eww, only one post shows up.
 With lynx, lynx is opening multiple versions of itself, each new lynx showing a new post. Is it possible to do something similar in eww?
 Thanks

                              <span>I know this might be stupid probably is but, installing doom for the first time with this config takes a lot of time on my Laptop with 4GB ram and dual-core CPU to natively compile over 2000 files.
 My question is this just because of my laptop config or is emacsgcc compile real slow?
 By the way, I&#x27;m a noob with emacs so please be polite.
 And could mention some pros and cons of emacsgcc!

                              <span>So I am running emacs on my work mac and my personal mac computer. Both run the same version (28.0.50) and same personal config. On my personal mac, it takes about 5-7 seconds to start up (which seems a bit long, but tolerable). On my work mac, on the other hand, startup is about 90s. This wasn&#x27;t always the case. It initially ran the same on both computers, but one day it suddenly slowed down. I don&#x27;t remember if I did anything to break it, but the config file is the same on both. 
 I ran the esup profiler and it tells that the total user startup time is 0.123 sec, which is obviously not true (or the the slowdown is not due to the config file). 
 Any idea on what might be going on or how to accurately profile the startup process?

 Thought it would be good idea to have a visual comparison of two popular line number modes in Emacs. Left is linum-mode and right is display-line-numbers-mode. https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2022/03/line-number-display-in-gnu-emacs.html

                              <span>Hello. I just updated my iMac from Big Sur 11.6.5 to Monterey &#x60;12.3 today, and suddenly, I got the following warning when I ran GNU emacs (the one downloaded from GNU Emacs For Mac OS X) from Terminal:
 $ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs 2022-03-15 21:34:51.135 Emacs-x86_64-10_14[6713:94719] It&#x27;s not legal to call -layoutSubtreeIfNeeded on a view which is already being laid out. If you are implementing the view&#x27;s -layout method, you can call -[super layout] instead. Break on void _NSDetectedLayoutRecursion(void) to debug. This will be logged only once. This may break in the future. 
 Of course, I can suppress these warnings by redirecting outputs to /dev/null, but I didn&#x27;t get such warnings on Big Sur. Is there anyway to fix this warning instead of just redirecting the warnings to /dev/null?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Disclaimer: I want to avoid addressing stereotypes. As an academic, I know that the use of each of the tools and technologies has its own reasons.
 Still, the question remains for me. Why do so many influential emacs users come from the Apple ecosystem? One theory I guess is that the advent of Apple computers and the popularity of emacs coincided. In addition, the similarity of the philosophical origin of these two products can be another reason. What is your opinion?

                              <span>Hello, everyone. I am learning about programming with monads. I discovered the following while traversing a data structure with a State monad, but it&#x27;s easier to demonstrate with the IO monad. 
 If I use boolean operators, they will only evaluate the arguments that they need. e.g.: 
 Prelude&gt; False &amp;&amp; undefined False Prelude&gt; True &amp;&amp; undefined *** Exception: Prelude.undefined 
 So far, so good. This is what you&#x27;d expect. However, if I use the liftM group of functions to lift &amp;&amp; to a monad, this no longer works. e.g.:
 falsify :: IO Bool falsify &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;It is a falsehood.&quot; &gt;&gt; return False verify :: IO Bool verify &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;Verily, it is so.&quot; &gt;&gt; return True liftedAnd :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool liftedAnd &#x3D; liftM2 (&amp;&amp;) 
 Then, calling it in ghci:
 *Main&gt; falsify &#x60;liftedAnd&#x60; verify It is a falsehood. Verily, it is so. False 
 So, you can&#x27;t use liftedAnd for flow control. It&#x27;s easy enough to write an AND function that behaves properly:
 mAnd :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool -&gt; m Bool mAnd x y &#x3D; x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \b -&gt; if b then y else return False 
 Now, in ghci:
 *Main&gt; falsify &#x60;mAnd&#x60; verify It is a falsehood. False 
 So, my questions are:
  
Would someone please explain why liftM2 behaves this way?
 Is there somewhere in the standard libraries to look for properly behaved &amp;&amp; || if/then/else etc. for monads?
 Am I missing some key fact about liftM2? Perhaps I am not using it in the intended way.

                              <span>People often say that unsafePerformIO interacts poorly with the optimizer, but what does this actually mean? What kind of inspection is blocked by it? What optimizations can I expect to still work? For example, if I unsafePerformIO a primop, does that not cause any issue given that there&#x27;s nothing &quot;inside&quot; it to optimize? Or does it also block fusion from the outside?
 Any resources on this would be great, thanks!
 EDIT I had a senior moment - I actually meant unsafeCoerce 😅

                              <span>A few years I began to learn Haskell using codeanywhere.com, which was a remote development environment that I was comfortable with for creating web services (I variously switch from Mac to Windows to Chromeos as my personal device). As I recall, I could follow the standard stack installation and do pretty much whatever I wanted without issue. After some interruption (life) I have returned to codeanywhere.com to restart my journey but I&#x27;m finding that the IDE has changed and I am unable to install or use GHCI without running into errors in the process. 
 I put in a support ticket and was told to use their Haskell vscode extensions in the IDE, but I&#x27;m completely lost and haven&#x27;t found a simple tutorial to explain what I&#x27;m supposed to do or how to use them. 
 As an alternative, I can certainly install on a local machine or a VPS, but I feel like I&#x27;m missing something obvious with codeanywhere.com. Does anyone have experience working on this platform? What obvious thing am I missing here?

This allows me to reliably find time bottlenecks in my code.
 The problem is that I have to manually factor out my code into all these separate {-# SCC #-} functions.
 Are there any plans to do what I suggested in the title? It would be cool if I could select lines of code and have them marked to automatically get factored out into a function of name e.g. func_{FILENAME:LINE}.
 Can anyone here add this? (How much would this cost?)

 It seems GitHub no longer supports unauthenticated git from yesterday so dependencies on GitHub configured via cabal.project no longer build:
 The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported. Please see https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/ for more information.

 move :: (Modifiable a v, Modifiable a&#x27; v) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a&#x27; -&gt; IO () move b b&#x27; &#x3D; get b &gt;&gt;&#x3D; set b&#x27;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is there a way to use type families for it to constraint the function for parameters which have the same type Value a?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; class Modifiable a where type Value a set :: a -&gt; (Value a) -&gt; IO () get :: a -&gt; IO (Value a)
 move :: (Modifiable a, Modifiable a&#x27;, ...???) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a&#x27; -&gt; IO () move b b&#x27; &#x3D; get b &gt;&gt;&#x3D; set b&#x27; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hi,
 Could you advice an opensource project where I can start to use my haskell knowledge ?
 I&#x27;m interested in web3 + haskell now but any advice is okay for me :)

                              <span>I am currently reading Effective Notetaking by Fiona McPherson. It is by far the best book I ever read on this topic. It is basically a book on how to process text into note.

In my opinion, it is best to be read as a comprehensive &quot;how to pre-process a text before you incorporate your notes into your Zettelkasten&quot; (if you are a Zettler).</span>

 All apps share some common “libraries”
 Biz-tech users want the ability to change various thresholds, tolerances, feature flags almost daily. 
  
The way we do this currently is that literally all configuration is checked in as scala code. 
 Tech would like to do a single weekly release (or biweekly) wherein changes merged to master over the preceding cycle are promoted via a release branch to production (with an extra testing cycle in between cutting release branch from master and releasing to production)
 Business is saying “but we need to release daily” for the reason of various config changes they want to make (hotfixes in top of previously tested and released release b…</span>

 I am starting to use EMacs doom to take notes and organise my digital system (non programmer here).
 I am currently trying to build my workflow and I didn’t yet found a solution for the following: searching recursively in all subdirectories and open one file among the result with the default app. I have tried to use projectile and it works for searching recursively but I am not able to open files with defaul app (e.g. a pdf).
 Is there a way to achieve this?
 Thanks for the help

                              <span>I use a window manager and don&#x27;t need the title bar. Previously I achieved this with brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport &amp;&amp; brew install emacs-mac --with-no-title-bars.
 Tonight I installed emacs 29 with brew install emacs-app-good from jimeh/emacs-builds. Very much appreciate the work jimeh has done. But I don&#x27;t see any build flags, and don&#x27;t otherwise know how to remove the title bar.
 I&#x27;d be happy to learn how to remove title bar from either Emacs 28 or 29, I&#x27;m not wedded to 29. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I have switched from Company to Corfu but I am having difficulty getting the binding &quot;C-k&quot; to work as corfu previous. I use evil-mode so this would be a useful binding.
 My corfu setup is:
 (use-package corfu :straight t :defer t :diminish :bind (:map corfu-map (&quot;TAB&quot; . corfu-next) ([tab] . corfu-next) (&quot;S-TAB&quot; . corfu-previous) ([backtab] . corfu-previous) (&quot;C-j&quot; . corfu-next) (&quot;C-k&quot; . corfu-previous))) 
 &quot;C-j&quot; works completely fine, but &quot;C-k&quot; executes the action evil-insert-digraph (not entirely sure what that does...).
 Any suggestions are appreciated!

 Can I change my mode-line during numeric arguments being entered? I already do that when I&#x27;m in God Mode, so I would like to copy the same thing. Only, I don&#x27;t know a mode or other indicator for &quot;I&#x27;m entering numeric arguments now&quot;. How can I do this?

                              <span>I’m currently using emacs-jedi for Python, and I’m trying to use and evaluate lsp-mode/eglot.
 This is the minimum I’m looking for:
  
“Jump to definition” should work, including when I jump into dependencies and keep going (which are installed into virtualenvs)
 Syntax errors, undefined variables etc, should be highlighted
 I should get completions/popups when writing code
 I need for support for multiple Python projects, each in its own virtualenv, often with different Python versions, preferably with very little setup required.
  
Trying this out with lsp-mode and the different options (pyright, pylsp), I’m hitting major bugs, and wondering if anyone else has actually got this working in a satisfactory way.
 With python-lsp-server I can’t figure out how to get it to see my virtualenv at…</span>

 I copied this diagram by Martin Grund from https://punchcard.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/emacs-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper/ with the aim of making a printable version. If you want to edit it yourself, I&#x27;ve got the original .drawio file in the gist too, but it only renders as text. You&#x27;d have to save it and open it with https://www.diagrams.net/ or the application you can download from there.
 I am still trying to figure out the best presentation of the printable version, so any general suggestions will be very much appreciated. The aim is to have something that will be visible and useful printed on a sheet of Letter or A4 paper, viewed from about 3 feet away. (in other words, the distance from my eyes to the patch of wall where I&#x27;ve got a copied pinned up!)

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Trying to do more with emacs, I wanted to integrate my conda environments into my workflow. I spotted the conda.el package, and tried to install it with use-package : elisp (use-package conda :ensure t :init (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name &quot;~/miniconda3&quot;)) (setq conda-env-home-directory (expand-file-name &quot;~/miniconda3&quot;)) :config (conda-env-initialize-interactive-shells) (conda-env-initialize-eshell))  This does not pose any issue when evaluated (and I&#x27;ve checked on github, people do it that way). My miniconda install is indeed in ~/miniconda3. However, when I try to execute M-x conda-env-activate, I get the following message : Symbol&#x27;s value as variable is void : proper-dir
 Has anyone any idea how to fix this? Or is there another way to activate conda environments inside of emacs?

(Whenever I undo an edit in a file, a new file gets created with the same file name except with .~undo-tree~ file extension appended to it.) I&#x27;m not exactly sure what happened since this morning -- it was working fine then. I reinstalled Emacs and nuked the elpa packages and reinstalled them all, but the problem is still here. I&#x27;ve never seen this behavior before. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>EDIT: This has been solved in the comments.
 It seems to me that uuid is &quot;the way to go&quot; for creating IDs for linking since they are guaranteed unique, and will survive movement of a heading to another tree or file. Right?
 So I&#x27;m just starting to get into the whole linking-thingy in org mode, and it seems like I&#x27;ll need to call org-id-get-create just about every time before org-store-link. Rather than make both calls each time, would it make sense to create a new function, my-org-id-get-create-and-store-link, so it simply calls both functions? Could someone help me with a function that will do both id creating and link storing?
 I do have the following set:
 (setq org-id-link-to-org-use-id t) 
 Such a function must have been done before a thousand times, right? Or am I missing something in terms of id creation and workflow?

 Just published a blog post on how to build a Java timer/scheduler from scratch. It was a great excuse to explore the low-level mechanisms of concurrency in the JVM.Code snippets are in Scala!

 I hope to write a bunch more on the topic, if people find it interesting.

                              <span>I have a Python personal project that I&#x27;m trying to port to another language with a stronger type system. I&#x27;m new to Scala but it seems like one of the most promising choices.
 I use Linux at work but Windows on my personal laptop, which I still use for development. Yeah I know, everyone says developing on Windows sucks, but Git Bash fits decently well into my usual VS Code workflow, and until now I haven&#x27;t run into any issues big enough to need to dual-boot or use WSL. But with setting up a dev environment for Scala 3, I tried setting it up through Coursier as recommended and ran into a bunch of problems/annoyances with the installed tools. (I then tried the same thing on my Linux work laptop and everything worked smoothly right off the bat.) Here&#x27;s some of the issues:

                              <span>Recently saw this repo that shows the state of Haskell in a lot of programming applications. It classifies it as Immature for Numerical Programming; I would like to know what are the challenges in it.
 More importantly what (packages, libraries) would Haskellers love to have?

                              <span>Been a long time away from org-mode, several years. Org-mode used to manage my life, but due to unfortunate crises, I fell out of the habit. Updated my &#x60;init.el&#x60; to where EMACS would load without error, but org-mode still will not update using el-get as it should, nor will it compile without error.
 Upon attempting to run &#x60;make oldorg&#x60; I recieve the following output, which is generated output from &#x60;makeinfo --no-split org.texi -o org-info&#x60;
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; shell
 makeinfo --no-split org.texi -o org.info

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am able to compile org without generating the info files, but encounter difficulties getting EMACS to autoload org-mode from the &#x60;lisp/&#x60; directory correctly. 
 Any suggestions would be appreciated, or a better place to seek help. Thanks in advance.
 Org on people, org on.

                              <span>Hi, I try to create a function that reads a file and creates a Map with the word as key and the value 1 for all of them, and setting 0 as default. I got the following function defined:
 def mapFile(filePath:String): Map[String, Int] &#x3D; { Source.fromFile(filePath).getLines().map { line &#x3D;&gt; line.split(&quot; &quot;).map{ word&#x3D;&gt; (word,1) }.toMap.withDefaultValue(0) } } 
 Basically, 1st I try to iterate over the lines of the file, and then iterate over each word that is obtained when the line is splitted by spaces. The problem that this is returning me Iterator[scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,Int]], not Map[String, Int], so Im getting and error.
 Any idea how could I get the desired Map with all the words and 1 values?
 An example would be having the following file as input:
 hello this is a test bye 
 And the output should look like:
 Map(&quot;hello&quot; -&gt; 1, &quot;this&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;is&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;a&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;test&quot; -&gt; 1 , &quot;bye&quot; -&gt; 1)

 Here the code, purely functional state, chp6
 The beginning is a example (create a purely state random generator) and the end with Candy is just the generalization of the example that suppose to introduce the state monad.
 The use case for candy (THIS JUST A FINITE STATE MACHINE):
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Let&#x27;s implement a finite state automaton that models a simple candy dispenser. The machine has two inputs: you can insert a coin, or you can dispense candy by turning the knob. It can be in one of two states: locked or unlocked. It also tracks how many candies are left and how many coins it contains.
 - Inserting a coin into a locked machine will unlock it if there’s still any candy left.
 - Turning the knob on an unlocked machine will cause it to dispense one candy and return to a locked state.

                              <span>I would like to get some feedback from people that have used this library for abstracting over tagless final code.
 I have been looking at the distage example (https://github.com/7mind/distage-example), and it looks very promising for writing effectful programs that work both with ZIO and cats-effect as the effect implementation. Although I do wonder if the same can be achieved by defining the APIs in terms of a trifunctor effect, instead of the bifunctor effect type showcased in the example.
 Would appreciate any input on this or links to further related materials.

                              <span>I am currently working at a quite well known startup in my country as a Data Engineer for more than 2 years. Primarily I do Data Analysis, because of my academic Machine Learning background, which makes my role closer to Data Scientist. 
 However, I am interested to work on Distributed System, Databases, and Stream Processing- that is Distributed Data Systems in broad. I wrote a Microservice in Golang in my current workplace. But I do not think this experience is sufficient to get hired as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems.
 I guess, after talking to some other Data Engineers and going through job posts, a project that involves mocking data streams, data ingestion with Kafka, data processing with Flink, serving with ad-hoc Scala microservices, containerization with Docker, and deploying on a Kubernetes (MiniKube perhaps?) cluster might help. What else to add or remove?
 What may I do to learn and later get hired to work as a Data Engineer working on Distributed Systems?

                              <span>Since monads can be seen as some sort of &quot;container&quot; (functor), you might expect monad transformers to &quot;contain&quot; a value of the base monad. It&#x27;s the opposite though: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.4/docs/src/Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe.html#MaybeT
 newtype MaybeT m a &#x3D; MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) } 
 I would have expected &quot;Maybe (m a)&quot; instead of &quot;m (Maybe a)&quot;
 All the others I checked are similar (StateT and ExcepT).
 Is there a hand wavy explanation for that ? I can see that monad and transformer laws apply, but I don&#x27;t really understand why it&#x27;s this way.
 EDIT: Looks like I&#x27;m not the first to wonder https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/r20a4j/why_is_the_maybe_monad_transformer_defined_as/?utm_medium&#x3D;android_app&amp;utm_source&#x3D;share

                              <span>Hi I’ve been wondering, we’ve got Tweag‘s inline-java. And there’s an abandoned project providing .NET bindings. The Haskell Wiki states there’s no production ready approach currently available.
 I‘m immensely grateful for inline-java, and soon JVM‘s own FFI will improve over JNI, which is great in its own right. But do we have something for embedding C# code as well? Or some stable IPC to CLR or some other integrated way with little overhead that’s more robust than crude subprocessing or RPC?

                              <span>Fundamental question is :
 Is there a way to debug C++ in a docker with emacs ?
 What did you expect to happen?
 I&#x27;m launching gdb in emacs(I use DOOM) with this command after , gdb :
 gdb -i&#x3D;mi /docker:name_of_docker_container:/mnt/build/logicalError -ex &quot;set substitute-path /home/name_on_manjaro/CPP-Debug-Docker/ /mnt/&quot;
 I was expecting no issue because of &quot;set substitute-path&quot;.
 What actually happened?
 I&#x27;m trying to use gdb on code in a docker but it is not working well. I can debug with gud-gdb(console on left and code on right) but not with gdb &quot;gdb -i&#x3D;mi&quot; (with all information in 6 windows).
 I tried it on manjaro (and also ubuntu) with different projet. To be sure, I tested with this simple projet to reproduce with &quot;hello world&quot; and a docker and I have the same result : http…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks,
 Hope you&#x27;re doing great. I&#x27;m using Emacs for about 15 years (So basically a rookies in scale of Emacs :P). Based on my experience over the years and specially in the recent times, not many people know about the wonderful world of Emacs and why it is such a fascinating tool. To me they are missing out a chance to enjoy Emacs. So, a while ago I&#x27;ve decided to create a video series and talk about Emacs Lisp in context of a long running project to create an &quot;editor&quot; with Emacs Lisp, In hope to help more people to enjoy the tool that changed the way I use computers and brought me joy over all these years.
 Yesterday, I recorded the 4th episode of the video series. I thought to myself that It might be a good idea to share it on this subreddit as well. I have a looooooong term plan for this series and looking forward to your feedback.
 Like to the latest episode(4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NE1XUfrrGYI

                              <span>Hi
 I&#x27;ve just updated to 27.1 on Ubuntu 21.10, and I&#x27;m encountering some weird behaviour with &quot;M-.&#x27;
 Basically, it pops up a small &quot;text bubble&quot; where I can type a macro, which can get executed with enter. (See screenshot)
 I cannot figure out which commando is bound to M-. so I can disable it. Describe-key does not seem to work and overwriting it does not seem to help either
 My previous behavior was that M-. was bound to xref-find-definitions.

 Does anyone know what could be wrong here?

 Could please recommend me an online store where I can buy an Emacs t-shirt with low shipping cost? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>For certain reasons I am switching from LSP-mode to Eglot. I am a Python developer who works a lot with conda environments. Sometimes I will open a python file before realising I am in the wrong conda environment. This means the LSP server (pyright) started with LSP-mode uses the wrong Python interpreter, not giving completions for libraries which are envionment-specific.
 For this reason, in LSP-mode, I had:
 (add-hook &#x27;conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (lsp-restart-workspace)))
 I cannot find the equivalent for Eglot. If I do:
 (add-hook &#x27;conda-postactivate-hook (lambda () (eglot-reconnect)))
 Note I am using the conda.el package for conda environment switching.
 This does not work, instead I get the error &quot;Error running timer: Process EGLOT (test/python-mode) not running&quot;
 Is there a way for me to cleanly restart Eglot in the buffer as though I had changed environments before visiting the file? Note, if I change environments first and then open the file, Eglot is correctly started in the proper environment.
 Any help appreciated!

                              <span>Sometimes, when I decide to remove a link, I also need to remove the local file it is pointing at. Would it be at all possible for me to remove both using a single command, say, org-remove-link-and-trash-linked-file? For a safety measure, I&#x27;d rather use move-file-to-trash than to actually delete the associated file. 
 I already have this function to trash the current file, which works on my system (Linux Manjaro):
 (defun my-move-to-trash () (interactive) (if (y-or-n-p &quot;Trash this file?&quot;) (progn (setq this-buffer buffer-file-truename) (move-file-to-trash (buffer-file-name)) (kill-current-buffer) (message &quot;%s was trashed&quot; this-buffer))) nil)) 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have been trying to figure out if there is a way to create a section in an org file that has instantiations of different images to be used as figures later in the document where they do not get exported there, but do get exported later when they are referenced.
 Using DOOM Emacs, and exporting to PDF via LaTeX
 * Pictures Used :noexport:
 #+caption: something here
 #+name: fig:test
 [[filepath]]
 * This should be exported
 [[fig:test]]
 ​
 or something along these lines. The issues that arise are
  
the :noexport: stops the fig:test from being referenced at all and doesn&#x27;t export
 if the :noexport is removed, then it just exports inside the Pictures Used section, and a link is created to that location where I want the image itself
  
any help on this matter would be very useful, thank you.

                              <span>Hi all. I have this very simple org file,which looks like this:
 #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[scaled&#x3D;1.5]{helvet} \renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault} Testing equation #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex \begin{equation*} 1 + 1 &#x3D; 2 \end{equation*} #+END_EXPORT 
 Basically, just write out a line and then a Latex export block. The first line can be used to control the font size, by setting scaled to be whatever you want, it is set to 1.5 in this case. I cant seem to change the font size of the export latex block. You can see in this picture below:
 ​

 The body text is gigantic but the latex export font is not affected. How do I change this font size globally? I have a lot of these Latex export in my real document, and would like to know how to do that. 
 Appreciate all the help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a project that I&#x27;m working on for managing projects, I&#x27;m calling it projectwarrior (because it is built to integrate with taskwarrior). I want to add a project open command which would check org-roam for a node associated with this project and create one if it can&#x27;t find one (The idea is that this node would contain the project&#x27;s support material a la GTD). I had originally thought to use org-roam-protocol&#x27;s roam-ref, but I think I don&#x27;t understand how the file-ref which org-roam-protocol requires works.
 It seems intended mostly for citation purposes, which I think could work (maybe there&#x27;d be a way to get from emacs back to the projectwarrior project eventually?). But to do that, I think I&#x27;d need to write some sort of custom citation format. Unfortunately my Google-fu is failing me at the moment, as searching &quot;new org-ref protocol&quot;, &quot;custom org-roam-ref citation format&quot; and several other related results hasn&#x27;t brought up any results that pointed me in the right direction. So, here&#x27;s the question(s):
  
Is there a way I can suppress the warnings from org-roam when I put a ref that is plaintext? This isn&#x27;t actually my preferred solution, but I figure I&#x27;d start here.
 Is there a place I can find instructions on how to create a custom whatever-it-is that org-roam is expecting in the ref field?
 Is there another approach to opening (or creating if necessary) an org-roam node from the command line? Would something like emacsclient (open-this-node ) that might be simpler and easier to create?
  
Thank you in advance for the help!

Is there a way of doing this?

                              <span>Is this the correct use of a Monad Transformer?
 In my current code I have some pipes and a Consumer that logs info about incoming data, eg:
 haskell ledgerFoundInfo :: (Monad m, MonadIO m) &#x3D;&gt; AtomicLRU Int Ledger -&gt; Consumer Ledger m r ledgerFoundInfo cache &#x3D; forever $ do msg  show (lLedgerIndex msg)) liftIO $ infoM &quot;Ledger&quot; (&quot;Has processed ledger this run: &quot;  show (isJust exists)) liftIO $ debugM &quot;Ledger&quot; (&quot;Received ledger data: &quot;  show msg)  
 Is this bad? How would I make this more FP style? Is there some Free Monad/type system magic I could use here?
 Thanks and sorry if I&#x27;m dumb.

                              <span>Hi!
 [Disclaimer] I just started learning Scala. So I hope this question is not too basic.
 I&#x27;m doing the Advent of Code 2021 challenges to get a feeling for the language. Day 2 is a task where we have to parse a file, where each line contains a command. Each command updates one of 2 variables. I&#x27;ve tried to implement this using a functional programming style. I convert the commands to (Int, Int) tuples, where each element is a delta introduced by the command. Then, I need to sum these tuples element-wise (like a vector sum). Doing this sum was not very nice, because Scala seems to disallow tuple destructuring in (anonymous) function parameter position. Am I missing something?
 Also, do you have suggestions how I could make my code more idiomatic? I would love to hear them!
 Thank you in advance!
  def problem1_tuples(input: Iterator[String]): Int &#x3D; { // input is an iterator of lines val (position, depth) &#x3D; input.map(s &#x3D;&gt; ( applyRegex(s,forward_pattern), // returns update for first value in tuple or 0 applyRegex(s,down_pattern) - applyRegex(s,up_pattern) // update for second value )).fold((0,0))((a,b) &#x3D;&gt; (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)) // this is *ugly* position * depth // the challenge asks for the product }

                              <span>I have this scenario very often, but never bother to ask a question
 I have below code in my config. Simple org-roam-bibtex config.
  (use-package! org-roam-bibtex :after (org-roam) :hook (org-roam-mode . org-roam-bibtex-mode) :config (require &#x27;org-ref) ;; (setq org-roam-bibtex-preformat-keywords ;; &#x27;(&quot;&#x3D;key&#x3D;&quot; &quot;title&quot; &quot;url&quot; &quot;file&quot; &quot;author-or-editor&quot; &quot;keywords&quot;)) ;; I can&#x27;t find this variable in orb ;; (setq orb-preformat-keywords &#x27;(&quot;&#x3D;key&#x3D;&quot; &quot;title&quot; &quot;url&quot; &quot;file&quot; &quot;author-or-editor&quot; &quot;keywords&quot;)) (setq orb-templates &#x27;((&quot;r&quot; &quot;ref&quot; plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) &quot;&quot; :file-name &quot;${slug}&quot; :head &quot;#+TITLE: ${&#x3D;key&#x3D;}: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref} - tags :: - keywords :: ${keywords} \n* ${title}\n :PROPERTIES:\n :Custom_ID: ${&#x3D;key&#x3D;}\n :URL: ${url}\n :AUTHOR: ${author-or-editor}\n :NOTER_DOCUMENT: %(orb-process-file-field \&quot;${&#x3D;key&#x3D;}\&quot;)\n :NOTER_PAGE: \n :END:\n\n&quot; :unnarrowed t)))) 
 after I start emacs, orb-xxx variables are not found in describe-variables. and I need to &#x27;(require &#x27;org-roam-bibtex)&#x27; to have orb-xxx variables loaded. 
 What is going on here? 
 Is there a reading material about this? I am truely exhausted.

The keybindings for the window show nothing of interest. I suppose it&#x27;s possible to update multiple modules at once. Right? Right?!...

 ​
 I would like to automatically refresh my *Python* (ipython) buffer when longer than x lines, without refreshing the variables.
 ​
 I had: 
 (add-hook &#x27;comint-output-filter-functions &#x27;comint-truncate-buffer)
 ​
 But it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s doing anything... Any help is much appreciated! Thank you a lot!

 I want * Buy milk under the ** Buy/Return heading. Then the C-c C-w org-refile completion looks like
 Standard Tasks/Buy\/Return/ 
 That can get very confusing esp if you have a few slash alternatives in one or more headlines. If I were given the choice between reserving the slash char for my human-readable org headlines vs. used in the completion tree syntax, I&#x27;d rather the completion tree syntax look more like this:
 Standard Tasks%Buy/Return% 
 or perhaps:
 Standard Tasks|Buy/Return| 
 But if I have to live with it, I guess I could use the pipe char
 * Buy milk ... * Tasks ** Buy|Return 
 Then 
 Standard Tasks\Buy|Return\

                              <span>Hi all. I previously posted about Vertico, Marginalia, and Orderless and Corfu, Kind-icon, and Corfu-doc.
 This time I wrote on Cape!
 I highly recommend using cape to those who use corfu. It provides many useful completion-at-point-functions as well as transformers such as cape-capf-buster and cape-capf-silent. My favorite is cape-company-to-capf which converts company backends to completion-at-point-functions! This was the killer feature for me.
 Though this post is less thorough and has less &quot;developed&quot; code than my previous two posts, I hope a few of you still find it useful :)
 Edit: Some of you may notice the website redesign. I hope it adds clarity.

                              <span>Helll Guys I recently tried using dap mode for debugging and it worked fine in GUI. In terminal it was mostly good expect for breakpoints not showing on the left fringe.
 Has anyone encountered this and knows how to fix it ? Otherwise i might try something with a background overlay upon breakpoint toggle but that would be suboptimal
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m looking into writing some new functionality for emacs and as part of it need to be able to dynamically highlight individual characters, I&#x27;ve looked into messing with font-lock-mode briefly but that seems to be more geared to syntax highlighting based on regex. 
 I also tried using put-overlay and am now trying the highlight.el package but the way I&#x27;ve written it so far doesn&#x27;t actually work and I&#x27;m not sure why. Can anyone point me in a better direction if this ain&#x27;t the way/tell me where I&#x27;m screwing up?
 first I define a face:
 (defface position-1-face &#x27;((t (:foreground &quot;#FF0000&quot; :weight bold))) &quot;The face for the first increment out of from the cursor&quot; :group &#x27;increment-faces) 
 Then I apply it like this
 (when (&#x3D; neg (point-min)) (hlt-highlight-region neg neg &#x27;position-1-face)) 
 Where plus and neg are values that are 10 characters from the current point in either direction. My eventual goal with this is to have characters like 10, 20 and 30 characters out from the cursor highlighted so I can jump around more easily without having to figure out distances. 
 I know the faces are getting applied from the output of describe-char but they do not seem to actually show up.
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to drop the dependence on highlight.el so if there is a better built in way then please do let me know

                              <span>Hey there, I&#x27;d like to program some stuff for my arduino via (doom) emacs, but there are a few things, that I need:
  
Syntax Highlighting
 Auto completion
 Support for Arduino and Teensy
  
What I have tried
  
https://github.com/arduino/arduino-language-server - It needs modification of lsp-mode though, as it doesn&#x27;t support passing cli arguments ootb
 https://github.com/motform/arduino-cli-mode and https://github.com/yuutayamada/company-arduino/ - Together they seem somewhat fine, but as soon as the project has a few .c/.cpp files the .ino triggered arduino-cli-mode poofs.
  
What I want to avoid
 Installing an IDE, I want to stay with emacs as far as possible. I don&#x27;t like chonky bloated IDEs
 Other options
 https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile - How with the above mentioned QOL though
 Note: I&#x27;m very unfamiliar with elisp, I can do very basic things via trial and error while copying other stuff from my config.
 Do you have any idea what could be done here? I have tried everything I could.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Just an FYI for all windows users. I installed Gccemacs on my work computer last night, and the process was very simple.
  
Install Msys2
 In Msys2 terminal, install libgccjit. Add to $PATH if it&#x27;s not already there.
 Download emacs 28 or 29 from GNU: https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/ and run it. I used 28.0.91 build.
  
The snapshot Emacs binaries are compiled with native comp. It just works.
 Thanks to the dedicated folks that create window binaries.

                              <span>Sorry guys if I am being annoying, but I got another problem that I cannot figure out by myself.
 As stated previously I was following the old emacs from scratch series from system crafters youtube channel to customize my emacs and it throws of error along with the line loading file .../elpa/bind-key-number.number/bind-key.elc failed to provide feature &#x27;bind-key&#x27;
 So, at first, I thought I may don&#x27;t have the package but when I tried installing it I was failing. So I searched the web a bit and found this bind-key file from tumashu/elpa git repo. So I copied it and pasted it in my bind-key.elpa file. After evaluating the buffer if I re-evaluate my init buffer everything seems to work. But if I re-start emacs the error comes back again which again goes off after re-evaluating the said buffers. 
 Is there any permanent fix for this problem? What am I doing wrong?

 tl;dr: I&#x27;m usually at least as happy with M-&amp; and dired as I am with bash in a terminal. Keyboard macros replace bash one-liners.

                              <span>emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin 28.0.91.151565-1 (GNU Emacs. Development native-comp branch and pgtk branch combined, served as a binary.) 
 emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git 29.0.50.154614-1 (An unofficial fork combining the development branch of GNU Emacs (including native compilation) with the new rendering engine PGTK.)
 emacs-git 29.0.50.154805-1 (Development branch of GNU Emacs. As of June 2021, it includes support for native compilation merged from the Emacs&#x27; branch: feature/native-comp ) 
 so emacs-git is the official development branch but it only includes native compile feature. 
 emacs-gcc-wayland-devel-bin and emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git seem to include native compile AND pgtk (pure gtk which is what is needed to run emacs as a native wayland app), so between these two, which should i pick? which one are people running for using emacs natively on wayland?

                              <span>I am fairly new to emacs and recently started customising it following the emacs from scratch video series from system crafters. But I am stuck at the line to set the font.
 First I thought maybe I haven&#x27;t installed the font so I installed it using pacman. It installed it in &quot;/usr/share/fonts/TTF/FiraCode-Retina&quot;.
 Now how do I use this font in emacs?
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;?&quot;)
 What do I put in the position of ?. I have tried putting the font name. Font name along with its absolute path. And some other variations. But everytime it just says font not found!
 Thank you for your help.
 ...
 Ok, that was a stupid mistake on my part.
 I just used &quot;Fira Code Retina&quot; and it seems to work. Sorry for the trouble!

                              <span>Hi all. I am customizing a Nord theme. The problem is that the face for hl-line kinda looks too much like the face for when you try to select a text using evil visual mode (press V)/. If without evil mode, this same face can also be shown if you just drag select using mouse. This is what I meant on a Nord theme:
 ​
 Nothing selected, just hl-line highlighting current line
 ​
 You can barely see the word VISUAL under Visual mode in vim (pressing V)
 ​
 Again, here I drag and select the word VISUAL using the mouse. Hard to see
 To see things clearly, I use a different light theme:
 ​
 Normal with only hl-line face color
 ​
 Here you can see both the hl-line and the vim Visual/drag select very clearly.
 Question: What is that face name, he one you drag select/highlight using evil? I tried to do an M-x customize and type &quot;evil&quot; but I got are something like evil-ex-search
 Any input is greatly appreciated.

Orders are managed (buy / sell / replace / cancel) with Emacs. When there are a few seconds to spare, I navigate in Emacs to the order replace template (widget) and type in the new value to replace an existing order; e.g., 15.00 and C-u C-c C-c to send. [Absent a universal argument is used when I want to inspect the proposed order before sending.] Sometimes there are substantially less than a few seconds to spare, and a faster method is needed. I suppose I could use a keyboard shortcut such +/- and C-u C-c C-c to send when the value is correct.

 https://www.lumi.com/jobs
 We are looking for a full-stack developers with skills in both backend and frontend development.
 We use PureScript and React on the frontend and Haskell and Postgres on the backend. On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.
 Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.

                              <span>Playing around with GHCi I stumbled upon the Solo type (by looking at which types are an instance of Traversable). 
 Googling tells me that Solo is a singleton tuple, but it is not clear to me what is the usefulness of having a singleton tuple over just an unwrapped value, and if the singleton tuple is important why isn&#x27;t there some behind-the-scene-syntactic-sugar-magic to use the usual brackets notation for tuples also for singleton tuples?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>imo FRP is so so good. Its paradigm feels extremely natural in a way beyond the complexity of its encoding would suggest. eg looking at the implementation of reflex a few times, it seems to basically implement an entire runtime system on top of haskell&#x27;s runtime system.
 On one hand it&#x27;s very cool that haskell is flexible enough to implement a runtime system as a library, but I wonder if there&#x27;s gains to be made in something more wired in (eg in terms of optimization, simplifying compile times, simplifying types, etc.) - it always struck my as a bit hacky.
 I know elm used to have builtin FRP but dropped it (I don&#x27;t recall exactly why - any insight here would help!)
 Perhaps a proper &quot;dataflow&quot; language - though my (poorly informed) impression is that these are all way more special purpose and I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the full power of haskell.
 What do you think?
 EDIT: Looking into it more now - I redescovered this explanation of why Elm dropped FRP. It&#x27;s honestly pretty disappointing - I understand from a developer UX perspective this simplifies a lot of things, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the redux &quot;smash-everything-into-one-type&quot; pattern - and a big draw for FRP is having the control flow represent dependency locality rather than synchronizing everything on one monlithic state

                              <span>Title is kinda confusing, wasn&#x27;t sure how to phrase this.
 I have a type Contact defined as follows :
 type Contact &#x3D; (Person, State)
 I have a function in which I want to take some information about a Person to create a new Contact (with State &#x3D; Good), and add it to a list of contacts, which looks like this :
  addContact :: Person -&gt; [Contact] -&gt; [Contact] addContact p c &#x3D; c ++ (p, Good) 
 Compiler is complaining with the following message : Couldn&#x27;t match expected type [Contact] with actual type (Person, State)
 But given that I have defined that Contact is a tuple with (Person, State), how am I supposed to declare that it is indeed a Contact? I can&#x27;t seem to be able to create an instance of it because it&#x27;s not a data type, just a type.

                              <span>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this isn&#x27;t possible, but I&#x27;m trying to include parts of a code block in another and not the whole thing like you usually do. E.g. only line 1 to 5 or something, but not 6 through 10.
 From the docs, I see it&#x27;s possible to pass parameters, but I&#x27;m not sure if the same can be done for including a code block limited to certain line numbers. Couldn&#x27;t find much online and stack exchange is down for maintenance right now too.
 If I&#x27;m explaining it badly I basically want to do like:
 #+name: test #+start_src :noweb yes Line1 Line2 Line3 Line4 #+end_src #+start_src &gt; #+end_src 
 So I get:
 #+start_src Line1 Line2 #+end_src 
 I can live without it, but it&#x27;d be nice to not need to split up the code block when I&#x27;m doing cursed code additions.
 Also, I&#x27;m on my phone. Sorry if it looks horrible or the syntax is all wrong.

                              <span>Lumi is looking for Haskell and PureScript engineers to grow our supply chain platform. Lumi helps manufacturers around the world make their capabilities available directly to ecommerce brands. We are open to remote candidates in the US and UK.
 https://www.lumi.com/jobs
 We are looking for a full-stack developers with skills in both backend and frontend development.
 We use PureScript and React on the frontend and Haskell and Postgres on the backend. On the PureScript side, we use our own purescript-react-basic bindings, and purescript-lumi-components, a UI component library that we built and open-sourced. We get a lot of utility from PureScript’s type system, leveraging the compiler in order to ensure that we don’t get IDs for different entities mixed up, that all API calls are type correct, and that all form data is appropriately validated before it is used. On the Haskell side, we primarily use Servant and Esqueleto. We don’t expect candidates to have experience with all these things. We’d like to find engineers who are interested in learning more about these, and we’ll be happy to teach you.
 Lumi was recently acquired by Narvar, where we are continuing to grow the team and leveraging Narvar’s experience building the software infrastructure that powers billions of e-commerce shipments for companies like Patagonia, Nike, GAP, Home Depot, etc.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on mac osx and kind of experimented with emacs browsers, I found that I can compile emacs with xwidget&#x27;s but mac osx version is quite unstable and most other solutions depends on webkitgtk which is not exactly working on mac&#x27;s, so I experiment little bit with electron offscreen rendering and I&#x27;m able to get image of site on every rerender. I managed to successfully save it to file on every rerender and then show it from there in emacs using image-mode. Question is, can I do it more directly without filesystem? Send somehow image through stdio to emacs and render using image-mode? What would you recommend?

 Evidently that&#x27;s not right. It doesn&#x27;t work and the C-h v for the variable says something like

 Can someone explain the difference between a single quoted vaule and a double quoted value, and how to explicitly set the former in elisp? Thanks!

 emacs-mac only
 I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to Org-mode for note-taking, coming from Evernote, Notes.app, etc. I love the organizational power and security of plain text, but one thing I could never understand: why can&#x27;t I just directly paste image/PDF data into an org file?
 I use this literally all the time, accumulating graphs, formulae, small screenshots, images from papers, websites, manuscripts, etc. The other key feature I needed was that cropped PDF data remained exactly that: a PDF file on disk. This is because I may later use it in talks, white-papers, etc., where preserving the vector quality is crucial.
 So, after some time trying (and failing) to convince myself such functionality must already exist, I wrote up a small package. Note that it unfortunately works only with the excellent emacs-mac variant, which provides (some) information about image data on the clipboard. I&#x27;m hopeful similar more general functionality could come to emacs/org in the future.

 I am on a journey to tried my best to live inside Emacs. (Just a fun challenge.)
 It would be much easier to live inside Emacs if I give up on JavaScript and give up on graphical dependencies.
 Just an add salt to the wound, I am using wsl2 with Ubuntu distro + window terminal + window. At times, I need to learn PowerShell command just to communicate effectively with window from within Emacs which is launched inside wsl2 Ubuntu distro.
 The problem I have now, mostly because I use either wsl2 or window are the following.
  
Seamlessly browse internet: Nynx should solve my problem, but I can&#x27;t even install it in Ubuntu wsl2 currently. The problem is that I still want to stick with Chrome because ecosytem is more rich.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I was a long time emacs user (5+ years), but left a few years ago at the start of my PhD, my main reason for abandoning was to move to VS code simply for easier use of jupyter notebooks. 
 I need them to be easily sharable, so using ORG as a replacement isn&#x27;t viable for me. 
 Spell check, autocomplete and documentation are also very important to me. 
 Does anyone have a good setup for editing Jupyter notebooks directly, without converting between formats in emacs? 
 If so, could you share your workflow, I&#x27;d be very keen to get back into emacs. 
 Thanks,
 AH

 Hey org-mode lovers,
 Have you ever been in the following situation?
 You have tried to understand a specific aspect of org-mode (say a command) and you have done the following:
  
you have played with the command (writing your own examples),
 you have read all the parts in the manual dealing with this command,
 you have read the docstring of the command,
 you have looked for explanations on the web,
 you even have read the source code of the command,
  
but you still haven&#x27;t figured it out after all the efforts.
 I&#x27;ve been in that situation and I thought it would be easier if there were more examples.
 BUT THERE ARE MORE EXAMPLES.
 We just have to change our lenses to see them.
 What if we looked at org-mode tests as example…</span>

                              <span>Hi all. In my emacs, whenever I type &lt;s and press TAB I would get an auto expand block like this:
 #+begin_src #+end_src 
 How do I make these headers to be capitalized? I have checked all my configs and there are no lines that said something about making the headers lower case. Interestingly, the Org website section 1.5 said that the default behavior should be capitalized, not lower case: https://orgmode.org/org.html
 There is this answer here but to switch to lower case instead: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34931/org-source-block-in-lowercase
 So I decide to experiment with the &quot;accepted&quot; answer and tried with upcase
 (mapc (lambda (arg) (setcdr arg (list (upcase (cadr arg))))) org-structure-template-alist) 
 This yields error about wrong type argument listp, export ascii which is the list of argument/header to be inserted in the variable: org-structure-template-alist
 Any help is greatly appreciated. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
I am writing a book and would like some feedbacks and best practices from you, regarding the method and organization.
I use now The Archive app and Google Docs.
Here is my organization:
I have a master file (a structure note) containing the outline of the book, ie the different chapters. Each chapter is a link in the structure note.
In the structure note, I put also some misc notes, like research notes.
I put a special tag in the filename of the chapters (like @b1 for book number 1).
I can check the total number of words up to date with the shell command: wc -w *@b1*.md
The step I didn&#x27;t like very much is that I need to edit and compile the chapters in another tool. I use Google docs for that. Each time I find a mistake in my content, I need to modify the content in Google Docs and in The Archive app (source of my content). Not very efficient.
Please comment my workflow and share your practices :-)
Thanks</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ll actually ask the archiving question first, since it&#x27;s simpler: Is there any way to break up the archive files by year, so that anything I archive this year goes to journal.org_archive2022 or similar? I&#x27;m concerned that archives may grow too big and wondered if this could be automatic or if it&#x27;s just something I should do manually.
  
The second question is harder (for me). I&#x27;m trying to set up my capture templates such that every day is the date in ISO format plus the day of the week, so a capture would make a subheading under 2022-03-11 FRIDAY. 
 This is probably not going to be super hard, but the org manual is.... vague on how I would do it. The &quot;hard&quot; one is, I&#x27;d like to have another template that puts the subheading underneath not only the date but another subheading. So you&#x27;d wind up with:
 * 2022-03-11 FRIDAY ** Log *** Entered Subheading Text, Text [Entered at [TIMESTAMP]] 
 I have no idea how to even begin to do this, because I&#x27;m not sure of several things. 
 1) How to make emacs give the initial heading as an ISO date rather than a datetree
 2) How to make it double up on headings so I get Log
 3) How to make this all respect my extend-day-until setting, because I go to bed WAY after midnight
 I&#x27;m meandering here but I&#x27;m hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 So I am trying to find an easy way of summarizing what I did do on a particular day or week.
 I am mostly using Todos/Tasks that I mostly complete through the Agenda view, but I also log smaller tasks, questions, stuff that showed up within the journal (C-c c j).
 What I am looking for is a way to just summarize all Todos that were closed and journal entries made on a particular day in one output.
 I looked a bit at clock table, but as I am not looking for &quot;time spent&quot; but rather &quot;what did I do - what was closed and logged?&quot; it doesn&#x27;t seemt to be the right tool.

                              <span>So my partner is moving in with me soon and she&#x27;s a &quot;normie&quot; and therefore won&#x27;t be using Org any time soon. I anticipate that we&#x27;ll need to share several lists (groceries, home shopping, errands,...) and, naturally, I want my lists to live in Org. So I was wondering what kind of more user-friendly list managers are out there that have a 2-way interface (read and write) with Org? Here are some qualifications:
  
I&#x27;m aware of Orgzly and I use it on my own phone but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s simple enough for someone who&#x27;s not invested in making it work.
 I found a github repo for syncing with Wunderlist but learned that Wunderlist shut down 2 years ago.
 For some things (e.g. events), we can use a shared calendar and I already have such a setup going with org-caldav-sync. I was wondering if there&#x27;s something similar people use for to-do lists, shopping lists, etc...

 I tried brew and sdkman, no success. There was installed M1 java. Only way I have found so far is to ask IDEA to download intel java and use sbt shell there. But it works not good.

                              <span>Hi all :)
 I have 1 year of experience as a research engineer and, I am studying scala to switch my career to a distributed system(DS) engineer within this year.
 Currently, I am following the scala course of Coursera, but many posts in this subreddit mention various scala frameworks. I want to know that it is necessary to cover famous frameworks like akka, ZIO, spark.
 I am not afraid to learn, but I just want to set priorities.
 Are there some frameworks or packages, which are commonly used in scala?
 (Like node of javascript Or NumPy, scikit-learn in Python. )
 Sometimes I check a job description of scala keyword on Linkedin, but many of them do not mention what they want to an applicant (They just say like &quot;we prefer scala&quot; or &quot;we use scala&quot;)
 So I am wondering where I have to focus to be a distributed system engineer.
 I studied distributed systems in graduate school, so my goal is to implement some DS toy projects using scala.
 Could I ask for advice to be a DS engineer?
 Thank you for reading :)

                              <span>Quoting from a stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2346872/what-does-the-symbol-mean-in-haskell
  
(and similarly a &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (b &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (c &gt;&gt;&#x3D; d)) is equivalent to
  
do r1 &lt;- a r2 &lt;- b r1 r3 &lt;- c r2 d r3 
 The bind operator makes a functions input be wrapped in the same thing as the output by unwrapping the value before each chained function.
 E.G.
 https://preview.redd.it/2cqc5bow4tm81.png?width&#x3D;746&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;03f8677e5be06e7eb8dc5661786cfc7d42b89ffc
 Is this the reverse? It unwraps rather than wraps the output. And it only works for IO types? I&#x27;ve got the impression that IO is special is this unique to the io type?

Currently the only cases where I do not care about a functions return value are for ones with side-effects. Also Haskell has no mutable state so if you discard a value from a pure function it has no effects, right?
 Is there any other use case for this operator?

                              <span>Hello Haskell-ers!
 I&#x27;m looking to implement a JSON linter and would appreciate some library / architecture suggestions. Some examples of the kind issues i&#x27;m interested in detecting are:
  
The field &quot;base_path&quot;, if it exists, cannot use Windows paths, must be POSIX
 The field &quot;date_created&quot; must be in ISO8601
 etc.
  
I&#x27;m capable of writing the linter rules (i.e. detect date formats, path formats etc.), what I need help with is the IO / initial parsing phase. I&#x27;m familiar with parser-combinators (attoparsec has been my goto previously) but never before had a use case that cares about where the parsing failed. I&#x27;ve also used aeson a couple of times for handling JSON.
 The defining requirement is that, once an issue has been identified, the linter must report the location of the error including line number(s) and column numbers (start and end). It can be assumed that the data is valid JSON and conforms to the expected schema (i.e. if we expect a &quot;date_created&quot; field, it&#x27;ll be there. I&#x27;m interested in format/quality issues rather than validating structure / syntax.
 Otherwise, the only requirement is that it be quick / run in parallel - It must be able to run over thousands of files in a couple of minutes.
 My initial plan was to use something like pipes-aeson for IO (not used a streaming library before but seems straightforward enough) however it seems that aeson is based on attoparsec and the parse-error is just a plain string without source locations.
 So, finally, to some questions.
  
Anybody have recommendations for parsing JSON (quickly) while keeping track of the source-locations of each field / key / value / object etc.
 Can streaming libraries like pipes be used to process the loaded files in parallel? Pointers / articles etc. covering this would be much appreciated!

 You don’t have to have Elm or Haskell experience, but it will help :)
 You do need to have interest in functional programming, but you probably wouldn’t be in this subreddit if you didn’t, now would you?
 Our shared working hours are 10 AM to 3 PM Eastern, you do need to be available during those hours, though we&#x27;re flexible if something comes up.
 $100,000-$120,000 but do not quote me on the compensation, that is from memory for our associate level, it could be less or more by $10,000.
 The job description is for a mid-level, we don&#x27;t have an associate FP job description. But just the technologies and the level are different, everything else should be the same.

 Hello,
 I am learning Haskell as part of a comp-sci course at University and have come across a wierd error when I try to build a package using cabal. 
 When I run cabal install, the installation fails due to the package wai-logger-2.4.0 not being able to build due to the package cabal-doctest-1.0.9 being broken with the specific error: 
 &quot;Could not find module Distributive.Extra.Doctest&quot;
 How can I fix this error?
 I have tried the following: 1. Reinstall cabal-doctest 2. Reinstall distributive 3. Delete and reinstall all cabal packages after running cabal update 4. Reinstall ghc
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently creating a project which I wanted to try using opaleye for DB access in. I have an M1 Mac with 16GB of RAM and use ghc-8.10.7 by stack-2.7.5, both installed through ghcup.
 Soon after starting to build product-profunctors, I get an error
 -- While building package product-profunctors-0.11.0.3 (scroll up to its section to see the error) using: /Users/mateusz/.stack/setup-exe-cache/aarch64-osx/Cabal-simple_mPHDZzAJ_3.2.1.0_ghc-8.10.7 --builddir&#x3D;.stack-work/dist/aarch64-osx/Cabal-3.2.1.0 build --ghc-options &quot; -fdiagnostics-color&#x3D;always&quot; Process exited with code: ExitFailure (-9) (THIS MAY INDICATE OUT OF MEMORY) 
 When I rerun, I get the same result in a few secs. It must be very quick, as I don&#x27;t see any visible spike in memory usage on monitor (it oscillates around 9-10GB). /usr/bin/time -l shows rss of 200MB, but I guess it&#x27;s stack&#x27;s usage, not ghc&#x27;s.
 That&#x27;s strange to me as I compile a 300+ deps project at my work in a similar amount of RAM without problems, and I have also compiled stack on my 4GB Raspberry Pi (which took a lot of time, but didn&#x27;t outofmemory either). Is this package really that heavy, or there&#x27;s something wrong with my installation?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to write a type class that will convert one type of error into another, e.g. Exception e &#x3D;&gt; e -&gt; Error. I&#x27;d like it to work for &quot;wrapped&quot; errors as well for convenience, e.g. Exception e &#x3D;&gt; Either e a -&gt; Either Error a. But I can&#x27;t seem to get around the problem of conflicting instances.
 (if you prefer code in a gist: https://gist.github.com/evanrelf/f5773113b3a50e3aee7f44ba2cc05ea5)
 The error type&#x27;s implementation isn&#x27;t important, so we&#x27;ll use a trivial one here:
 data Error &#x3D; Error deriving stock Show deriving anyclass Exception 
 I tried using functional dependencies:
 class ToError i o | i -&gt; o where toError :: i -&gt; o instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError e Error where toError :: e -&gt; Error toError &#x3D; undefined instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) where toError :: Either e a -&gt; Either Error a toError &#x3D; undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Functional dependencies conflict between instance declarations: instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError e Error instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError (Either e a) (Either Error a) 
 I also tried using associated type families:
 class ToError a where type Output a :: Type toError :: a -&gt; Output a instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError e where type Output e &#x3D; Error toError :: e -&gt; Error toError &#x3D; undefined instance Exception e &#x3D;&gt; ToError (Either e a) where type Output (Either e a) &#x3D; Either Error a toError :: Either e a -&gt; Either Error a toError &#x3D; undefined 
 ...but I get an error:
 Conflicting family instance declarations: Output e &#x3D; Error Output (Either e a) &#x3D; Either Error a 
 Adding {-# OVERLAPPING #-} pragmas doesn&#x27;t make a difference.
 I believe GHC selects instances based on the instance head, not the instance context, so nothing I do on the left side of the fat arrow will make a difference.
 Is there any other way I could formulate this to get my desired functionality, where the output type is determined by the input type?

 The errors I&#x27;m receiving:

 I&#x27;ve been bashing my head against this for several hours now and I&#x27;m at a total loss.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a beginner in Haskell and am trying to set up a parser for formulas. I am running into the issue that my parser will parse the beginning of the string when it should give a parse error due to non-exhaustive consumption of the input string.
 I&#x27;m not sure how to check that the entire input string is being consumed by the parser.

                              <span>I am excited to announce the first release of Nickel! In the
original introductory blog post blog post, I’ve written about why we, at
Tweag, are developing yet another configuration language. Our goal is to empower
people to write correct, programmable and maintainable configurations. Nickel
targets Nix, Infrastructure-as-Code, build systems, and more. We think such a
tool would greatly help taming the growing complexity of configuring systems.
Since the first blog post, we have made progress. We backed up and changed our
mind sometimes. We had a lot of discussions, and we also experimented quite a
bit. There is still a lot to do and there are many imperfect aspects of the language
to improve.
Still, I think we have reached a point where Nickel is consistent enough for people
to try it mor…</span>

                              <span>I am following up on this thread from a year ago and was curious what kind of Emacs to use on a Mac in early 2022. In the past, I used Aquamacs and the standard homebrew version of emacs but have stepped away from Emacs in the past 2 years for various reasons. 
 I now want to give Org-mode another try and thus want to get back at using Emacs. Other than Ord-mode I would mostly use Emacs to write Markdown and LaTeX files and potentially some R. 
 It appears Aquamacs is finally actively maintained again but there seem to be some advantages of sticking to a more &quot;classic&quot; Emacs port. Any recommendations are very much appreciated.

 To my question: 
 If I only use the default config (no fancy packages, Melpa, Elpa and the like) would emacs do any network communications on its own as I start it?

Obviously C-h k and C-h f doesn&#x27;t work. C-h mouse-click to get docs about whatever element I click on would be nice to have :-).

                              <span>I have been on a quest to decrease my Emacs startup time and found something that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned on any of the blogs I came across on the topic. I think it is fairly well known that if you use straight.el, deactivating package.el in your early-init.el will speed up your starting time. What I only just found out is that on launch, straight does a lot of checks to see if any of the packages installed have been altered. This process can be changed by modifying the straight-check-for-modifications variable. I don&#x27;t edit any of my straight packages by hand, so I have this set to nil, before bootstrapping straight. This brought my startup time from ~2 seconds to ~0.5 seconds, for loading over 200 packages. Maybe there are some reasons why one shouldn&#x27;t do this that I don&#x27;t know, but it seems to be a nice way to save some time!
 For more information, see this section of straight&#x27;s read-me: https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#customizing-when-packages-are-built
 Hopefully this is of help to someone!

 lets you make minimaps in there own buffers that can be detached or moved. I made this so I could have a minimap in a separate frame then the one I&#x27;m editing in.

                              <span>I put what I thought was necessary in init.el to bind C-&#x27; to avy-goto-char-2. And it does bind within init.el, I can use it within init.el. But it&#x27;s not bound when I switch to my notes.org buffer. Instead, it&#x27;s bound to:
 C-&#x27; runs the command org-cycle-agenda-files (found in org-mode-map), 
 Here is what I think is the relevant section of my init.el, which comes after the org mode section: 
 (require &#x27;avy) ;; Integrate avy with iSearch ;; First enter iSearch, then whatever pattern to search, then C-&#x27; ;; C-s PATTERN C-&#x27; ;; Note that the C-&#x27; is bound here ONLY in the context of an interactive iSearch (avy-setup-default) ;; not sure what this does ;; (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-j&quot;) &#x27;avy-resume) ;; Suggested bindings from avy github docs (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-:&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-char-2) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g f&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-line) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g w&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-1) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-g e&quot;) &#x27;avy-goto-word-0) 
 Here&#x27;s my entire init.el, in case it&#x27;s needed:

                              <span>When using metals, when the project I&#x27;m working on cannot be compiled due to an error, which is often as I&#x27;m working on features, nothing in metals works. I cannot use hover, go to definition, references, etc. Is there a workaround for this? That is when I need those features the most.

                              <span>I feel like I&#x27;m missing something obvious when trying to split my org-mode emacs config into multiple files.
 Suppose I have two files: full-config.org, which serves as an aggregator of various configurations and specific-config.org, which is a config for any single customization.
 full-config.org contains the following code:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el :noweb yes &gt; #+end_src 
 and specific-config.org contains the following:
 #+name: disable-indentation #+begin_src emacs-lisp (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) #+end_src 
 What I expect to see after tangling the full-config.org is (setq org-adapt-indentation nil) in ~/.emacs.d/init.el; however, the file is blank.
 I can tangle the evaluation results of disable-indentation by placing () at the end of noweb, but I cannot figure out how to tangle the code itself.
 Can anyone please tell me if it is possible, and if so, how to do it properly? If it is not possible, is there an alternative way to update code in one &quot;aggregator&quot; file from multiple files without using transclusion?
 Thank you for your help!

 I’m a relatively new org user, but I’m completely sold on using plain text for life.
 Has anyone got any tips for planning gardening/farming in org mode? I feel like I need a few dimensions, such as the physical layout, as well as the more obvious planting/growing/harvesting schedule (I’m crudely just using org agenda schedules for this, but any tips welcome)

                              <span>After finally getting tired enough of not having a good way to quickly export Org Mode tables to other programs, I did it myself. It&#x27;s terrible, but it&#x27;s functional enough.
 Put your cursor on the first pipe character of the table, run the function, and the table can be pasted into an external program from your clipboard, like LibreOffice or even Excel.
 This only works with tables aligned to the left margin, and you need to run the function when the cursor is on the upper-leftmost pipe (first character) of the table.
 (defun abc/org-table-to-tsv () (interactive) (let ((temp-buffer-name &quot;*abc-table*&quot;)) (org-mark-element) (kill-ring-save nil nil &#x27;t) (switch-to-buffer temp-buffer-name) (yank) (beginning-of-buffer) (delete-char 2) ;; remove leading pipe (perform-replace &quot; | &quot; &quot; &quot; nil nil nil nil nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove trailing pipe (perform-replace &quot; | &quot; &quot; &quot; nil nil nil nil nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove internal pipes (replace-regexp &quot; +| &quot; &quot; &quot; nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove terminal pipe (replace-regexp &quot; +| &quot; &quot; &quot; nil (point-min) (point-max)) ;; remove separators (replace-regexp &quot;^|-+.* &quot; &quot;&quot; nil (point-min) (point-max)) (kill-ring-save (point-min) (point-max)) (kill-buffer temp-buffer-name)))

                              <span>imo Linear types is really cool and could revolutionize how haskell is written (eg alternatives to &quot;builder&quot; patterns, IO monad, bracket functions, &quot;move semantics&quot;, etc.)
 But! There&#x27;s a few factors that seem to make it unusable except for specific safety-centric code (I played with the ergonomics extensively last year by toying with a linear version of prim (eg https://github.com/daig/prim/blob/%E2%98%B8/class/Cmp.hs))
  
Basic quality of life stuff around linearity inference eg in let/where/case binding
 Lack of effective multiplicity polymorphism.
 Lack of sugar for Movable types (eg primitive numeric types, for which copy and move are identical - Ur is not a good solution for these basic types imo)
 Lack of linear primops.
 Lack of optimizations making use of linearity eg to shortcut garbage collection.
 Lack of support for automatic lifetime management (This isn&#x27;t really essential, but currently it&#x27;s akin to using manual new and delete with static guarantees - which is great but still cumbersome relative to C++ RAII or Rust&#x27;s lifetimes, and I believe could be inferred statically. Maybe it&#x27;s actually possible just with library support for something like a linear ResourceT monad but that still feels a bit unsatisfying)
 As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s solely the brainchild of Tweag - which is great to have industry support, but worrying in terms of robustness and longterm support as GHC develops. Linear types really needs fairly deep integration with the rest of GHC to be most useful.
  
1/2/3 are the only ones really stopping me from going all-in on linearity right now, but I expect all of them to get resolved eventually so long as 7 isn&#x27;t an issue.
 So my question is: What&#x27;s the latest developments on linear types in haskell / who is working on it / what&#x27;s the best place to keep updated?

                              <span>Idris has a nice construct for a sort of &quot;anonymous bind&quot;,
 main &#x3D; print (!readNumber + 5) 
 which is syntactic sugar for
 main &#x3D; do x &lt;- readNumber print (x + 5) 
 What&#x27;s nice about ! is that you can nest !s arbitrarily (and mix them with pure code) without needing to name any intermediate results; the desugaring does the sensible depth-first left-to-right evaluation you&#x27;d expect. (I&#x27;d note that ! is more powerful than the suggestion described here, since the applicative syntax doesn&#x27;t neatly support nesting; complex expressions end up in a join/pure soup.)
 Anyway, I was just wondering whether the GHC language design team had ever seriously considered porting this? There does seem to be demand for it: many mainstream imperative languages (even JavaScript!) have adopted ! - they just pronounce it await (and it&#x27;s only applicable in their &quot;promise&quot; monad).

Here&#x27;s one where I once found a list of signal words in text, e.g.: schema, model, allegory, analogy, hypothesis, metaphor, representation, simile, theory.

This is but a piece of the overall Zettelkasten puzzle. Was nice to see English terms for a change back when I read this. Sascha and I practiced hunting for definitions and arguments etc. for a while but I just haven&#x27;t found any other English source at that time.

 e^{\lambda_{1}} or e^{x^{2}}.
 I know I can wrap it in $$ and convert to a latex snippet but its not as fast and then the font doesn&#x27;t match. Let me know if thats the only way, or if I can change the default latex font somehow.

                              <span>A while ago I wrote a mini API server in order to let me leave &quot;private comments&quot; on a codebase.
  
Imagine being dropped into a new codebase and having the freedom to leave whatever todo items and breadcrumbs you want without cluttering the codebase. Imagine working on a client’s codebase and not having to worry about what you say, or who sees it.
  
I fully documented what it&#x27;d take to write a plugin for your favorite editor and wrote an example plugin for vim ... and then I switched to emacs.
 My emacs lisp chops are NOT up to writing a plugin that speaks to this API and displays the private comments inline. I&#x27;m imagining something akin to how magit shows commit messages inline. 
 I&#x27;m tired of not having access to this in my main editor. 
 If you or someone you know would be interested in writing this for me (as a public open source package, which i&#x27;ll be happy to maintain) I&#x27;ll happily pay you, or maybe donate the equivalent amount to help folks in Ukraine if you&#x27;d prefer. DM me here (or @masukomi on twitter) with how much you&#x27;d want.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a long time vim user that converted (mostly to Emacs). I&#x27;m to the point where I only use vim in a few situations (quick edits, specific servers), and I&#x27;ve recreated my old vim config in emacs: 
  
Buffer management-ivy and fzf
 evil keys everywhere
 surround.vim-evil-surround
 vim commentary-evil-commentary
 persistent undo-undo-fu
 web-mode/php-mode
 lots of keybindings like 
  
(evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;ivy-switch-buffer) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;e&quot;) (lambda() (interactive)(find-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/init.el&quot;))) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;ww&quot;) (lambda() (interactive)(find-file &quot;~/notes.org&quot;))) 
 (evil-define-key &#x27;normal &#x27;global (kbd &quot;DEL&quot; ) #&#x27;switch-to-last-buffer) 
 I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the workflow, but then I was satisfied with a pretty similar one in vim before. What stuff should I leverage that makes emacs superior to vim? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, elisp is a million times more pleasant than Vimscript and that alone makes a big difference. Oh, I do use magit and org already so maybe I have my answer. Curious if there are other vim converts out there who have words of wisdom on what else to try in emacs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing a cv in org mode and I want to make a list of publications. The way my cv class works, I use description lists with a date and a description in org mode like this:
 - 2018--2022 :: Job at company 
 which exports to:
 \begin{description} \item[2018--2022] Job at company \end{description} 
 This is then formatted exactly how I like. I really don&#x27;t want to massively change the way this works, because it took me a long time to get the class just right, I&#x27;ve tried a few approaches (e.g. tables and tabularx) and this was the best way overall (so far).
 I want to be able to write this:
 - [cite:@key_20] - [cite:@otherkey_22] 
 and have it export like this (or equivalent):
 \begin{description} \item[2020] \cite{key_20} \item[2022] \cite{otherkey_22} \end{description} 
 where the dates in the square brackets for the \item macros are automatically pulled from the bib data associated with the relevant @key. (I realise \cite is probably not the best citation command to use here. I use biblatex so I&#x27;ll probably pick something reasonable from that package. The point is the date thing).
 How would anyone approach this? I&#x27;ve fiddled about a bit and can&#x27;t find a way yet.

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 I have been toying around with the idea of trying out emacs for quite a while now and I really wanna give it a go now. However, I am completely lost and need guidance about how to actually use it.
 Any recommendations are very welcome.
 Thank you all in advance!

                              <span>Been using this to find files system wide, mostly random org file notes on things but it&#x27;s great. Just wondering what everyone else is doing for a fuzzy file search, like ctrl-p in vim? The cool thing about this is you can select the folder before the search which means it&#x27;s not going to just crawl your entire user folder etc.
 Anyway what&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s approach to this?

                              <span>I currently have a global keybind set up so that I can open org-agenda, that works all fine, opening the menu with all the optiosn (a,t,m etc.) but I find myself using the n option (agenda and all TODOs) more than anything else, and I would like to bind that to a separate keybind.
 This would be trivial if I just wanted to run org-agenda-list (a) but since the option I want is part of the org-agenda-custom-commands and has no direct function associated to it I don&#x27;t know how to do this.
 Any help is welcomed!

                              <span>A bit of a weird one, but I regularly want to know how much time I&#x27;ve spent today in total including the time spent on the current clocked in task (basically, when I&#x27;m checking if I&#x27;ve done enough hours for the day). I could always clock out and then clock in again but that&#x27;s a bit annoying.
 Does anyone have a good way of getting org-mode&#x27;s clock tables to include the current time in?

 I&#x27;m asking this because I&#x27;m new and I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m fooling myself that font colored levels does anything good. When I &quot;discovered&quot; themes and faces, I got pretty excited at the eye candy. At first, it looked really nice and seemed like a good idea. But now, idk.
 I&#x27;m curious, how many org mode level-colors (or other font attributes for levels) do you have? What does your different font attributes for levels mean?

                              <span>I use .emacs-custom.el to contain the customizations made by the interactive functions. However, I&#x27;d like to start moving some of that stuff out so I can manage it myself and make comments. I tried pulling some stuff out and putting into my init.el, but it didn&#x27;t work. Namely, I pulled out these:
 &#x27;(org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;)))) &#x27;(org-upcoming-deadline ((t (:foreground &quot;#FF33FF&quot;)))) &#x27;(org-warning ((t (:background &quot;#ffffa0&quot; :foreground &quot;#ff33ff&quot; :weight normal)))) 
 Why don&#x27;t these work within my init.el? I tried them before and after my (load custom-file).
 EDIT: Ok I see I&#x27;m supposed to use set-face-attribute. So I tried wrapping the above, but this doesn&#x27;t work
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-todo ((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:weight normal :box (:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;)))) 
 EDIT 2: I figured out the answer. A correct, commonly used form for set-face-attribute is like this:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-todo nil :box &#x27;(:line-width 1 :color &quot;#808080&quot;) :weight &#x27;normal :foreground &quot;#FF00FF&quot; :background &quot;#f0f0f0&quot;) 
 And it probably didn&#x27;t work with a straight copy because each of those first three lines, I think those are args to the function (custom-set-faces...). I don&#x27;t know what it does behind the scenes, but I guess it wants its args in a certain format.

                              <span>As part of my workflow I have 2 scenarios I do most of the time when using magit:
 - Commit, rebase from master then force push to my own branch
 - Commit then squash the new commit with the previous commit, rebase from master, force push to my own branch
 I wonder if there is a way to automate these scenarios with magit to then use just one key combination?

                              <span>For anyone who uses org-mode to take notes (especially in uni), do you treat an org file as a single note or as an entire notebook? It would be nice to see what other people are doing so I can (possibly) adjust my note-taking strategy.
 Edit my current strategy is: ~/Notes////
 For example ~/Notes/Spring_2022/MAT2440/week6/wednesday_march_9_2022.org
 and ~/Notes is a git repo so I can keep it in sync with my desktop at home (as I have some hybrid (online and in-person) classes and need to keep them in both places)

 i just cant understand why our sbt doesnt have this &quot;ordinary&quot; feature that gem, npm, yarn, poetry, etc have...
 why cant we just run something like &quot;sbt install github.path.to.package --save&quot;?

                              <span>I started to mature as a emacs users, so now I am trying to start developing things. 
 I notice that I encounter familiar name often. Once that comes to mind right now is /u/github-alphapapa and I also encounter this repo from /u/akirakom (https://github.com/akirak). 
 After looking into those repo, I figured out that these guys have solved problem that I had, am having, and don&#x27;t even know that I have. 
 So I am now trying to gather all repos from these &quot;emacs super developers&quot;, so I can study their code, understand problem that bother them, understand how they solve problem and one day be good enough to continuously contribute to the community. 
 Thank you in advance.

 i want a variable that is unique to this heading something like a category so when there 
 is no todos and the heading is empty i still get the value of the variable only in the current agenda heading

 I have a million files at work all called index.js and searching through buffers using the path would be really helpful for that. I couldn&#x27;t find an option for it.

                              <span>So I don&#x27;t do a lot of heaving coding, but I do embedded code in C/C++, scripts in Python and play with Racket/Lisp when time permits. I&#x27;ve been using VS code for work, but in school we used a very basic setup for Java programming in Emacs and I enjoyed using Emacs (I don&#x27;t do Java programming though).
 I want to really learn Emacs and have gone through the basic tutorials. I want to start adding packages but it all seems so overwhelming to me. I&#x27;d like to add a package at a time to my basically blank configuration.
 Can anyone recommend just the basic packages I should have to do C/C++ and Python until I learn how to use those? I&#x27;d like the basic IDE stuff like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, file differences and a file tree. Recommendations? What else should I have?

                              <span>I use BetterBibTex and Zotero to export my bibliography + files + notes. Is there a quick way to extract the note field from the .bib file to a standalone orgmode file and convert its formatting to orgmode? Ideally with the file containing the citekey as well.
 I assume the simplest way would be to copy the content from the field, create a new buffer, paste the content to the new buffer, then export it to orgmode. But this also seems like a lot of work and I&#x27;d like to automate it if possible.
 Additional question for org-roam! I&#x27;d like to turn each reference into a node, so I can track each to what references I end up using more, which I tend to co-use, etc. Is there a good way to find every citekey in my bibliography, convert into something that org-ref, org-cite, citar, whatever can understand, and export them as nodes in one file with the citekey being in the :roam-refs: field?

                              <span>Does org-mode/emacs have a good to represent historical timelines.
 I am starting study on history and philosophy, and want to be able to easily keep track of dates, events, birth-to-death of individuals, birth-to-death of nations etc. 
 Wikipedia does it using multiple pages for different timescales
  
Timelines_of_world_history
 Timelines_of_modern_history
 Timeline_of_the_17th_century
 1630s
  
My goal is to have navigable timeline to quickly find items of relevance. Is the above Wikipedia method the best available. Is there a mode that would help manage this?
 Also I want to use something similar to time.graphics for visualisation. It&#x27;s quite expensive though. 
 Do you have any ideas, on how I should visualise timelines?

                              <span>I have enabled org-encrypt for my journal files to keep certain things private and this works well but I recently noticed that after saving the file and its contents encrypted and I undo the last change to the file, the entire contents of the file is revealed without being prompted for a password. This happens even after waiting for a long time. I would expect to be prompted for a password each time the encrypted contents is to be shown but this is not the case. Is this the expected behavior? If not, how do I prevent it from happening?

                              <span>Hi, 
 Trying to use &quot;assertThrows&quot; as I&#x27;m trying to learn about unit testing, but I&#x27;m stuck. I made a simple calculator and wrote some tests to test them, they are all fine, simply using assert, but as soon as I want to test that an exception is supposed to be thrown, the test fails with the following error message:
 type mismatch; found : org.scalatest.Assertion (which expands to) org.scalatest.compatible.Assertion required: Int assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) 
 Here is the code I&#x27;m using:
 import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec import calctest.Calculator object ScalaTestingStyles class CalculatorSuite extends AnyFlatSpec { val calculator &#x3D; new Calculator &quot;Calculator&quot; should &quot;add two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.add(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 15 ) } it should &quot;subtract two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.subtract(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 5 ) } it should &quot;multiply two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.multiply(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 50 ) } it should &quot;divide two numbers&quot; in { assert( calculator.divide(10, 5) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 2 ) } it should &quot;Throw an exception if denominator is zero&quot; { assertThrows[ArithmeticException](calculator.divide(10, 0)) } } 
 And here is my simple calculator:
 class Calculator { def add(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a + b def subtract(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a - b def multiply(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a * b def divide(a: Int, b: Int) &#x3D; a / b } 
 It&#x27;s the last test that is failing, this was part of a rock the JVM tutorial, but instead of funspec I&#x27;m trying to learn flatspec. Why is this failing please?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been studying FP for a while now in my spare time, mostly in Scala and TypeScript. I&#x27;ve gotten very deep into it. I feel I have a strong understanding of all the core concepts, as well as all the most common monads and other main design patterns. In short, I feel like I&#x27;ve got a very solid grasp of programming in FP.
 My problem lately just comes down to putting it all together at scale. Whenever I&#x27;ve tried to write a full app using purely FP design principles, it feels like it becomes a mess as I layer on more and more features. Because of this, I feel my main limitation is how to use functional composition for a larger system when dealing with network requests/responses, database operations, dependency injection, loose coupling, etc. I can write an application that does all these things, I just haven&#x27;t been really happy with the results.
 What I&#x27;m hoping to get is one of two things. The first would be an example codebase, something open on GitHub. Something using, maybe, http4s and cats? Something that I can look through and study how it&#x27;s been architected, maybe even transcribe it (I have found that re-writing code makes it stick in my head better than just reading it).
 On the other hand, maybe there are some tutorials/courses/etc out there which cover this kind of stuff. I really do NOT want one of those &quot;This is a functor&quot; type FP courses, I don&#x27;t need that at this point. Something that goes much deeper into full-scale application construction is what I&#x27;m after.
 Thanks in advance for any help and guidance you can provide.

                              <span>Hi everyone, is there an alternative formulation of monad transformers that allow removing any reference to the base monad inside the e.g. bind definition of the transformer ? 
 The reason I&#x27;m asking for that is I&#x27;m porting some Haskell transformers to Python, for which I would like to avoid chains of lift.lift.lift... 
 A good way I found is simply to make a custom subclass of each transformer in the stack, so that they can be looked up for their lift by &quot;tag&quot; (the specific subclass) rather than numerical position (aka number of lift nesting). That would make composition of function using different monads very easy, even if they have not been designed to work together specifically 
 This would still allows the user to use multiple transformers of the same type (e.g. StateT), since the user can create as many subclasses of StateT they want for each piece of state.
 The problem with that is that if the user uses e.g. SubclassofStateT.pure(42), the base monad is not known , and has to be &quot;resolved&quot; later (when looking up the index of this class in the stack to lift appropriately). Unfortunately automatic, lifting is not enough since the definition of e.g. pure() would require the knowledge of the base monad which we don&#x27;t have at this stage. Hence the need for an alternative formulation that allows delaying this knowledge to later.
 EDIT: fix typos

                              <span>iOS &amp; Android mobile apps for r/SimpleXChat are live 🚀 - install it via links here: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat – please star the repo while you are there!
 We built it to help all people living in oppressive regimes communicate freely with each other, without fear of persecution because of what they said and who they are connected with.
 During the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine, people of both countries – I have friends and family there – could be at risk when sharing their opinions or just from being connected to people who were prosecuted.
 Every messenger app that knows who you are can end up sharing all of your connections with undesirable third parties, either as a result of a court order or as a result of attack - so even Signal, which has strong encryption, cannot protect your connection graph.
 Huge &quot;thank you&quot; 🙏 to 137 people who helped us test and improve the apps and to u/angerman who helped a lot by compiling our Haskell code to mobile platforms and getting it accepted by app stores – and we have just submitted the release than makes the app working on iPhone 7.
 From our experience – building mobile apps with Haskell is non-trivial but doable – so if you have complex client-side logic that benefits from the advanced type system, then Haskell is a viable choice – we hope our project makes it a bit better for others too.
 Let us know what you think about the apps and we are looking forward to releasing the new features, e.g. e2e encrypted WebRTC audio/video calls – see the full release announcement here.

Does anyone have ideas or samples that I could follow?
In the instance I&#x27;m currently exploring, OPML files are the intermediary between the ZK and, in this case, iThoughtsX.
The trick will be to get correct OPML file formatting as an output via Marked 2, python, applescript or Keyboard Maestro.
Check this out for a first rough go. So far only one level thick. But this was easy. Each link on the central node is a child node on the mindmap. The full text of each child node is attached. Links within the text are not hot, but we&#x27;ll see. 
I&#x27;ve attached the file so you can download, review, and explore the ideas. Requires an app that will read iThoughtsX files. This type of download might be a way of sharing a specific idea thread from my ZK with the world.</span>

                              <span>Hello,
I would rather use a link-as-search to be as future proof and software agnostic as possible. I also prefer to use a UID internal to the body of the text instead of using a filename as I am very new to this and still changing my titles. To create an internal link, I copy the UID number of the filename (without the title) at the top of the body of my zettel. Then in my second zettel, I open a [[]] and inside I paste the UID number of the first zettel. The [[UID]] becomes green. When I hover on it it says that the file is not found. When I click on it, a search is launched and I have my two zettels that appear in the search bar but the target zettel does not open automatically. Is it normal? Should it only open in the search bar?
I saw that a &quot;#&quot; was sometimes set before the UID (in the body) of the zettel of origin. Is this necessary besides to denote that it is the zettel of origin?
Thank you and sorry if it is a bit messy (or very obvious), I am totally new with markdown and all of these softwares!</span>

 addAndDrop &#x3D; const . (1+)
 Can anyone please explain how is this working
 Afaik (.) Operator takes two functions and compose them but the composition operator takes function that takes 1 input and one output but const take two inputs, then how is it working?

 The work will be paid accordingly! 
 Also, if this is not the correct sub for labor, can you please point me in the right direction, as I did not find a specific Haskell jobs sub, thanks.

 As a user, I am quite thrilled about named routes, as well as another change in Servant 0.19 brought by our team at Tweag (this time driven by Andrea Condoluci): better error messages for faulty routes. Writing routes in a type-level DSL can be tricky because errors can get hairy, and you lose a lot of the benefits of interacting with GHC&#x27;s type checker. Both of these changes should help make Servant APIs more manageable, and more accessible to newcomers.

 What I want to do is to define a function insert that will run the appropriate version of insertXXX based on the type of the first argument, imagine something like the following:
 insert :: pair -&gt; [(a, b)] -&gt; [(a, b)] insert &#x3D; case typeOf pair of (a, b) -&gt; insertOrd (b, a) -&gt; insertFlipped _ -&gt; fail_during_compilation 
 Of course, that code is not valid Haskell, but I was wondering if I could achieve something like that using some type-level magic.
 Thanks in advance for any suggestion!

                              <span>I am pretty new to Haskell and learning it for fun, coming from Python. I recently tried to solve a problem using memoization, and I was surprised how hard it is in Haskell. I read up on a few things, for example
 https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Fix_and_recursion
 that provides the basic concepts. Naively, I had assumed that pure functional programming language should make memoization *easier* as there are no unintended side-effects. Instead, basically every approach I found requires me rewrite the function definition itself of the function I want to memoize. 
 Am I simply missing something? Are there some techniques for memoization that don&#x27;t require rewriting the function? Maybe some compiler settings?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m reading &quot;Thinking functionally with Haskell&quot; chapter 2. I have questions about Exercise D in Chapter 2.
 The first part of the question was easy to understand. It is about comparing lazy vs strict evaluation about the expression
 head (map f xs) where xs is a list of length n.
 -&gt; With Strict evaluation the function f is applied to all elements in xs after which the first element of the list is retrieved. So function f is applied n times.
 -&gt; With lazy evaluation the expression is reduced to
 let p &#x3D; map f xs in head (p)
 which reduces to f applies to the first element in XS. i.e. f xs0 
 ​
 In the second part of the question, there is a function filter p which when applied to a list returns a list of elements that satisfies the boolean test p.
 filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
 head . filter p xs returns the first element that satisfies the condition p. 
 In the question I&#x27;m having a hard time visualizing how lazy evaluation will work. With innermost reduction, the filter is applied to each element of the list and a list with elements that satisfies p is returned and head takes the first element of the list. 
 How will lazy evaluation work here? applying p to the input list might prune away elements from the output. 
 Is it that with lazy evaluation, filter p is applied only until the first element in the list meets the criteria as opposed to eager evaluation where filter p is applied to all elements in the input list?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve fount solution for this issue here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/48719/keep-text-selection-after-indenting-with-evil 
 It works but I have couple of questions. 
 Whenever I use evil-mode and when I select some text and move/indent it with &quot;&quot; , in mini-buffer there is message Wrong type argument: wholenump, nil Should that concern me? 
 Currently, this fix is placed outside of mine use-package config of evil-mode. Could that be the reason of the message in mini-buffer? It would be nice if I could place this fix inside of my use-package evil-mode config.
 Here is chunk of code from my init.el : LINK
 Thanks in advance,

                              <span>Hi,
 A very strange situation here. When I launch the client from the terminal using emacsclient -c, the client launches with the terminal showing a message Waiting for Emacs.... However, when I use a .desktop file it fails to launch! Curiously, when I set Terminal&#x3D;true in the .desktop, it works. Any idea what&#x27;s going wrong? Thanks!
 EDIT: Terminal&#x3D;false -&gt; Terminal&#x3D;true

                              <span>Hi there,
 I was wondering whether anyone had experimented with a custom icalendar org template. I see that there is the gnus-icalendar-insinuate-org-templates function. I also notice there is a key that is used, but I don&#x27;t think changing the key to one that is linked to a custom template would work. 
 What is your setup with gnu-icalendar? 
 Best,
 Enrique.

                              <span>After some investigation, I discovered one of my hooks were failing:
 (add-hook &#x27;web-mode-hook &#x27;something) 
 Tracking back a bit, I was wondering why .dir.locals were not being read, and it was because of the hook failure - all later hooks were being halted as a result, so it was not reading .dir.locals. I was only able to notice that by going to the *Messages* buffer.
 Is there a way to configure Emacs to throw an error when a hook fails? That would be much better for debugging and for making any errors obvious. I don&#x27;t want to be lenient to hook failures.

                              <span>A very annoying issue with desktop-save and desktop-read that I&#x27;m encountering at the moment:
  
I&#x27;m starting Emacs in daemon-mode, and then open a client frame. I do &#x27;desktop-read&#x27; and my saved desktop opens with the 10 or so frames I had saved.
 
When I go to one of the frames with a buffer I&#x27;m no longer interested in, and do C-x C-c, I end up not just closing that particular frame, but all 10 or so of the frames that were open.
 
The Emacs daemon is still running, and opening another client frame shows that the buffers haven&#x27;t been killed, so nothing has been lost per se - it&#x27;s just that the arrangement of all the frames I had is just ruined.
 
 Any idea how to stop this behaviour (i.e. being able to just kill one frame from the saved configuration)? 
 I should add that I have also been using the minimal setup for desktop.el as shown in the EmacsWiki, but I /think/ (but am not sure) that the problem is independent of this.

                              <span>Hello ,
 I&#x27;m looking to write a function, for my role-playing games, allowing me to create random tables with elements that have weight.
 For example, consider the following list:
 1 - 20 : 2d6 kobold
 21 - 45 : 1 troll
 46 - 100 : 3d6 orcs
 Running the function I want to be able to pick 20% of the time the &quot;2d6 kobold&quot; etc.
 Ideally, the function would allow me to automatically execute the dice roll. I will have then, for example: 5 kobolds!
 Not being a programmer, all I can do is create a function to select an item from a &quot;flat&quot; list.
 Any idea?

 I would like help getting this to work, or at least understanding why &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work that way&quot;.
 (I know I can just call C-u C-RET to accomplish the same thing, but I&#x27;m learning elisp and I did the above work first, so I&#x27;d like to know why it doesn&#x27;t work.)

 I am just trying to see what other options for organisations/agenda are available in other approaches which I am not aware of.

                              <span>When opening PDFs or Images the quality and loading time is decent, but doesn&#x27;t even feel close to apps designated for the purpose of doing so. Especially loading times in resizing pale in comparison.
 I&#x27;m genuinely curious, why is it that these features aren&#x27;t well performing if so many people use Emacs as a file browser too?
 EDIT: ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED (mostly) My pdf-tools install didn&#x27;t seem to work properly, I have fixed it now and it is a lot better. Some things still are a bit clunky, but it definitely is a lot faster better now!

                              <span>Hi! I cannot figure out this bug, and do not know where I&#x27;d start. Whenever packages are installed I sometimes get autoloads that look sorta like this:
 (custom-autoload &#x27;async-bytecomp-package-mode &quot;async-bytecomp&quot; nil)
 (autoload &#x27;async-bytecomp-package-mode &quot;async-bytecomp&quot; &quot;\
 (&quot;Byte compile asynchronously packages installed with package.el.
 Async compilation of packages can be controlled by
 \async-bytecomp-allowed-packages&#x27;.&#x60;
 &#x60;If called interactively, enable Async-Bytecomp-Package&#x60; &#x60;mode if ARG is positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or&#x60; &#x60;negative. If called from Lisp, also enable the mode if&#x60; &#x60;ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is \&#x60;toggle&#x27;;&#x60; &#x60;disable the mode otherwise.&#x60; 
 \(fn &amp;optional ARG)&quot; 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default)) t nil)
 The (&quot; starting on line 3 and the snippet
 151 152 (face default) 207 208 (face default) 266 267 (face default) 323 324 (face default) 381 382 (face default))
 break autoloads for all sorts of packages in a way that is hard to track down (paren/quote mismatch leads to invalid autoloads for rest of the file).
 The snippet does not always feature the same numbers. Example:
 34 35 (face default) 91 92 (face default) 148 149 (face default) 201 202 (face default) 260 261 (face default))
 ...any ideas on this? These snippets have appeared in a wide number of autoload files-- magit, org-roam, valign, some ivy rich packages, etc. They do not appear in the upstream git repositories.
 ​
 They also reappear on package update, breaking large swathes of functionality.

                              <span>I have a hot key associated with the #proofing Saved Search. After the last update the hotkey now triggers the saved search in all tabs and all the multiple windows that are open rather than just the one with the focus. I usually operate in the two-window mode. I tried changing the hotkey but no joy.</span>

Last Week
Wrote a scientist profile using The Archive and Marked2
Created a Poetry of Zettelkasting video showing how I use The Archive and Marked2 in my writing
Studied and became more familiar with the writer tools in Marked2
Read The Secret to Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel, a graphic autobiography. ★★★★★
Didn&#x27;t re-engage with woodworking like I said I would last week. I&#x27;m trying again this week.
This Week
Refactoring Meditations on Self-Discipline 201901021303 from 90% quotes to 90% my assimilation of the quotes meaning. This book I onboarded at the beginning of my ZK journey. So I&#x27;ve spent about 10 hours over the last couple of weeks on this. It is a rewarding time spent refactoring this series of 30 notes—only a few more to go. &quot;Ferraiolo, William. Meditations on Self-Discipline and Failure: Stoic Exercise for Mental Fitness. O Books, 2017.&quot;
Reading and onboarding &quot;Paul, Annie Murphy. The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021.&quot;
Spring Break, so no JAMM328 assignments
Re-engage with woodworking. Maybe having a tie-in with my ZK might help motivate me. Thanks, @sfast, for the link to a beautiful ZK cabinet.</span>

                              <span>Sorry to ask this here, I couldn&#x27;t find the setting in the readme.
 When I finish typing any word in SLIME and go to push enter, it has already loaded the &quot;no matches, so here&#x27;s everything&quot; list of completions, so I need to move back a character and forward just to get rid of the list. It&#x27;s killing me.
 Here&#x27;s an example picture, me typing &#x27;foo, and the list loads for... some reason?

                              <span>Hi I am trying to bind multiple keys for a toggle of bookmarks, but I cant really figure out how to do that. What I want is M-b-b for toggle bookmarks.
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-b-b&quot;) #&#x27;bm-toggle) but that doesnt work because: &quot;M- must prefix a single character, not b-b&quot;
 I tried multiple combinations, like &quot;M-b M-b&quot; but without any success. Is it possible to do this with global-set-key or even the :bind in use-package?
 M &#x3D; Meta key

 I was just wondering out of all the FRP libraries, which one is the most effective and up-to-date? My undergraduate thesis will likely be concerning FRP in Haskell to generate music.

                              <span>I think one of the massively underrated use cases of Haskell is as a tool for discussion. For example I recently was chatting to a friend about a particular chess analysis he was experimenting with and although he is a non-programmer we were able to explore the idea very deeply through a quick 2 hour XP style discussion. He was 100% able to follow the data types and basics, but most importantly able to follow and guide the algorithms that resulted (as much as I was encoding english to haskell, he was also able to map back from haskell to his own internal model easily). 
 Haskell might be difficult to write, high learning curve etc, but its simplicity to read and follow is an underrated super feature?
 I blogged about it here (if you are interested in more detail of our XP session and some code snips etc) https://www.tomwells.org/blog/haskell_for_prototyping

                              <span>Having previously worked with python, java, C and javascript I have developed some personal preferences for features/styles in programming languages that don&#x27;t seem to be supported in more modern popular and low-level languages (Go and Rust).
 I&#x27;m wondering if these patterns are incorrect or if I&#x27;m attempting to use an object-orientated or functional style in a procedural language where it doesn&#x27;t fit.
 The following are a few of my favourites that initially sprung to mind.
  
Chained operations on arrays/lists with functionally defined behaviour e.g. a.filter(a &#x3D;&gt; a &gt; 5).sort().slice(2).max()
 Wrapper alternatives to checking for null. e.g. extending the previous example ...2).max().else(0)
 Inline everything. e.g. if a is b then c() else d() and for 1..X as x do a +&#x3D; x
  
Am I a functional programmer in denial? The only thing keeping me from this conclusion is that I use a lot of oop techniques in tandem with the above.
 Or do I just want what&#x27;s bad for me? In support of this is the fact that all the languages that allow these patterns are very generic and mainstream and don&#x27;t have the careful direction of your Gos and rusts.

 This theme looks good, but I hate the fact that&#x27;s in white - burns my eyes
 ​
 I like [DT&#x27;s theme](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/distro.tube ) &#x27;s theme - but how do i get his particular dark theme? Sorry if this is a very specific question...
 ​
 ​
 If not, is there any other place where i can just get the link for the theme, and apply it , like the one in the pic?

                              <span>I code in Python (which demands perfect indentation).
 ​
 Why would the cursor go all the way there?
 ​
 This happens in certain code blocks - when i insert a code block NOT inside a bullet the indentation seems perfect though.
 ​
 I know there&#x27;s _probably_ a really simple config i have to tweak in my config.el ( I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs ), but forgive me , I just have no clue 😅
 ​
 Oh , and i use Arch btw 
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been mentioning here and there that I wanted to assemble a (book) outline or two since Christmas, but so far, no progress.
So to create more leverage through peer pressure, I&#x27;m going to share progress here.
The topic is an open source library I&#x27;m a co-maintainer of for a couple of years now. https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift
The general idea of the library may survive, but the library itself is likely about to become obsolete in 1--3 years because of technical changes. That&#x27;s why I want to do something with this, anything really, before it can only go straight to the trash. (Aka the sub-conscious of the Zettelkasten through forgetting about it.)

                              <span>Hey Emacsers,
 How are you doing?
 I&#x27;m getting excited about this post because when I understood how hl-line-mode works, it opened new horizons for me in the world of Elisp.
 I hope you will feel the same way after:
  
reading this post or,
 by directly reading the source code of hl-line-mode that can be found in the file lisp/hl-line.el (only 205 LOC skipping comments and empty lines).
  
You can get emacs&#x27;s source code by running the following command:
 git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git 
 (This post will soon be added in Org format to https://github.com/tonyaldon/posts).

 Below function from embark library gets executed when I press embark-act after selecting a file
 (defun embark--ivy-selected () &quot;Target the currently selected item in Ivy. Return the category metadatum as the type of the target.&quot; ;; my favorite way of detecting Ivy (when (memq &#x27;ivy--queue-exhibit post-command-hook) (cons (completion-metadata-get (embark--metadata) &#x27;category) (ivy--expand-file-name (if (and (&gt; ivy--length 0) (stringp (ivy-state-current ivy-last))) (ivy-state-current ivy-last) ivy-text))))) 
 I debugged an found that the following expression is returning nil
 (completion-metadata-get (embark--metadata) &#x27;category) 
 Not sure what am I missing.

 After exporting an archive from Simplenote (Settings → Tools → Export Notes) and installing this package, run org-import-simplenote then select the downloaded archive. Every note (that isn&#x27;t trashed) will be imported as an Org heading, complete with the creation timestamp.
 The creation timestamp is used as the headline; I might add an option to use the first line of the note content instead, like how Simplenote itself displays notes.

                              <span>Last week, I released my new emacs package zetteldesk.el and made a post here for showcasing it. The idea was rather well accepted but I got a lot of feedback, that the README was too dense in information and it was hard for a new user to try it. I have tried fixing this, by integrating gifs for demonstrations instead of the raw info (which I moved to the wiki for anyone wanting it), adding a set of default bindings in the form of a hydra and a small sample config to get you started.
 ​
 I believe some people might have been set off by those problems, so I wanted to say thank you for pointing them out. I would love to hear what you think of it now, that I have tried to make it more explanative and if it is truly easier for someone to get started with it.
 ​
 As I said in the other post, I am very new to this, so I really appreciate and listen to feedback, as I feel the idea itself is good, but some parts of the implementation may be lacking, and who better to help me than the community.
 ​
 Thank you all for helping,
 Best regards,
 Vidianos

 I&#x27;m looking for a way to set a keybinding to switch the current active buffer to a specific one. In my case, it would be something like &quot;C-c p&quot; to switch to my Python run (*Python* buffer). Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find an example so far... Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you a lot in advance!

                              <span>TL;DR - I have ADHD...my desk is a mess, my emacs is a mess, my life is a mess. HEEEEELP!
 Let me start by apologizing for this long ass post. I&#x27;m having trouble articulating what I want. 
 I am using Doom Emacs.
 There are two things I have been trying to figure out how to do. They are probably very simple but I can&#x27;t seem to word them correctly in text so I am having trouble finding solutions. 
 I have ADHD, so things become very messy very quickly. If I don&#x27;t lay things out a certain way I can become distracted and/or lose interest. One way to prevent this is by adding some flair to whatever I am doing. Does anyone have an easy way to add some style to an org document? Some ideas I had was to change header colors, add images (which I have sort of figured out), and maybe add borders or something.
 Another issue caused by my constant mental blockages is organization. When I had seen projects in the Doom dashboard I thought this would work but it seems designed for coding projects. How does everyone organize their org files? I&#x27;d like to find a way to set up a notebook type thing and open a directory in a buffer to navigate between the different files. Like a table of contents for every projects, and maybe a master TOC for all of my org files.
 Again, sorry for the long winded post. I suck at Reddit, and don&#x27;t expect much response cuz long posts get ignored, but figured I&#x27;d shoot my shot.

 magit probably needs no introduction.
 While I find ssh-deploy really really useful, I observed that making changes using magit, such as deleting a hunk in a file or changing a branch (thereby changing files or file contents), the changes are understandably not propagated to remote dir.
 I am no lisp expert, but took up the challenge to get something working with my setup for these usecases:

                              <span>EDIT: THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED. (github questions moved to the github subreddit in this post). 
  
I&#x27;m just trying to get &quot;my feet wet&quot; a bit in browsing elisp and github. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a local variable, being used only right there? That&#x27;s Question1.
 Question2: So also, why does my search on github not find the reference for &quot;ctf&quot; in org.el? On github, I&#x27;ve set the repository to 
  
emacs-mirror
 mirrored from git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
  
Then in the upper left search text box, I do a &quot;search in this repository&quot; for ctf. It only gives me two files:
 test/lisp/epg-resources/seckey.asc
 doc/misc/mh-e.texi
 Question3: Why doesn&#x27;t it also list org.el? Am I misunderstanding that search function? I was looking for any other references to &quot;ctf&quot; in the code base. 
 So that&#x27;s my final question (Question4), is how do I find all occurrences of something in a repository using github web interface?

                              <span>I do a lot of literate programming and I feel a little bit annoying the fact that I could not find an easy way of using imenu list for the language I&#x27;m developing in.
 I have a project in common lisp, and I wrote this function
 (defun imenu-literate (src-edit?) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((imenu-generic-expression lisp-imenu-generic-expression) (imenu-create-index-function #&#x27;imenu-default-create-index-function)) (imenu-list-update-safe) (imenu-list-refresh) (call-interactively #&#x27;imenu) (when src-edit? (org-edit-special)))) 
 which is fair enough to understand and works but it sure feels like a Hack. Moreover I&#x27;d like to use this for more languages and I&#x27;d like to set the underlying mode through org mode as a pragma.
 But since this would be so convenient I wanted to ask if there is already something like this and I don&#x27;t have to invent a new wheel.
 Cheers!

 I built up a menu based on the M-o prefix key, but maybe it is not the best one.
 Could you advice me a free or rarely used key to use as a prefix-key ?

                              <span>Hi, I encountered these two lines while reading Purcell&#x27;s config. My main problem is not knowing the differences between &quot;making packages available&quot;, &quot;loading packages&quot;, and &quot;activating packages&quot;.
  
 From the docs, (setq package-enable-at-startup nil) doesn&#x27;t &quot;make installed packages available when Emacs starts&quot;. So, does &quot;installed packages&quot; here refer to packages found in load-path? Also, what does it mean for a package to be &quot;available&quot;? Such that (require &#x27;package) will work?
  
 Then, (package-initialize) will &quot;load Emacs Lisp packages, and activate them&quot;. So what do &quot;loading&quot; and &quot;activating&quot; here mean? Does &quot;loading&quot; here mean the same thing as (load FILE)? Then &quot;activating&quot; means (provide FEATURE)?
  
 I&#x27;ve tried reading Elisp Packaging Section but still couldn&#x27;t understand

                              <span>Sometimes during casual writing I use slang, abbrevs, company names, etc that I don&#x27;t want added to the dictionary. But I don&#x27;t want to turn off flyspell completely and the red squiggles annoy and distract the hell out of me. So I wrote a total hack to make them transient. Enjoy. Or don&#x27;t.
 Just install and call flyspell-toggle-transient-squiggle
 (defvar flyspell-transient-squiggle nil) (defun flyspell-toggle-transient-squiggle () (interactive) (setq flyspell-transient-squiggle (not flyspell-transient-squiggle)) (message &quot;Flyspell transient squiggle: %S&quot; flyspell-transient-squiggle)) (defun nuke-flyspell-squiggles (buf) (with-current-buffer buf (flyspell-delete-all-overlays))) (defadvice make-flyspell-overlay (around transient-flyspell-squiggle activate) ad-do-it (when flyspell-transient-squiggle (run-at-time &quot;3 sec&quot; nil &#x27;nuke-flyspell-squiggles (current-buffer))))

 Also, is there a way to pick a different color for the table header | Word | Phonetic Transcription | something like&quot;: black background with white text? and for even lines add a gray color like #ccc?

                              <span>I posted this about a week ago, but was asked to separate the questions by a mod.
 As the title implies, can you adjust Org to accept lower and upper case if you have &quot;TODO(a)&quot;, for example if org-use-fast-todo-selection &#x27;auto? Or adjust it to work like org-capture, so it doesn&#x27;t quit if A was pressed?

 When I type C-h k C-c C-o I verify that this function is bound.
 When my point is on a headline, the function generates a UUID in a new PROPERTIES drawer. The output at the bottom of the screen says &quot;running less /home//org/data//some-other-uuid&quot;
 The interactive documentation says that a list of links should be displayed so that I can choose the one I want.
 Any ideas?

 ​
 I plan to switch all of the files to org-mode and use org-babel-tangle&#x60; to generate the source files.
 ​
 I would like to clean it up a bit - make it look more professional. It&#x27;s missing a TOC and I have to specify the output file for every source code block. Any suggestions for improvement are appreciated.

                              <span>Since in my last Scala job we agreed that functions will be separate from data, I have often felt the urge to make many (most?) of those functions into extension methods. However, I felt it would introduce a bunch of boilerplate code that is not really necessary in any way.
 Now with syntax changes in Scala 3 generally, and also with the dedicated syntax for extension methods I don&#x27;t see any reason anymore to not write code this way. Feels like the best of both words.
 Can you think of any reason why that would be a bad idea. While I don&#x27;t have this problem right now, I can hardly imagine reviewers being content with such code in PRs, though I can&#x27;t see a reason for objections either.

                              <span>Hello again community! I&#x27;ve posted a few days before, some questions about diving into Scala.js, and thankfully I received great answers and I am continuing my research!
 Today I was trying to debug Scala.js within an IDE (both IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and VSCode).
 I&#x27;ve read some posts/issues/jetbrains issues but all of them are older (2016-17 era), but the most they managed to get is in-browser debugging.
 As years passed, is there a way to properly debug through an IDE?
 Also afaik debugging depends on sourcemaps, so does error tracking libraries such as Sentry. Is it possible to properly error track Scala.js?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m new to Haskell and trying to wrap my head around it, coming from imperative languages it&#x27;s so different I might as well have never coded in my life. I find the syntax... strange, to say the least.
 I&#x27;m trying to understand a solution for a function that detects if a String is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet), here it is :
  isPangram text &#x3D; all (&#x60;elem&#x60; text) [&#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27;] 
 What I don&#x27;t understand are those parentheses, they don&#x27;t make sense to me. 
 As far as I can tell, elem takes 2 arguments; a character then a string. So what does (elem text) even mean? It has to do something, because if I take those parentheses out, the function no longer works. Yet (elem text) doesn&#x27;t actually work on its own, so what is going on here?
 Also, all takes a list of booleans right? Assuming all is supposed to be applied to a list of booleans, I would think that (elem text) [&#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27;] should get reduced to a list of booleans, but actually that code also doesn&#x27;t work on its own. Where is the list of booleans all is applied to coming from, then?

                              <span>One thing I realized today from reading Johannes Schmidt’s paper1 is this:
In Luhmann’s second ZK:
Luhmann had 67,000 Main Notes (aka, Permanent Notes)
And he had 15,000 Literature Notecards in his bibliography (usually with about 10-15 bullet points of thoughts and page numbers per book or article he read).
This means for each book or article he read, he only creates on average 4 to 5 main notes.
The other bullet points (like the other 10 bullet points) he would just make references to the book and page numbers.
He would go to a card about Ideology for instance and write “For more on Ideology, see Williamson p. 256” for instance.
I think there’s an assumption out there that one ought develop every bullet point literature note they take.
Any thoughts on this?

 Menu to add/delete/change file and directory local variables and property line
 This is from my personal config. I thought it might be useful for others as well but too simple to be it&#x27;s own package.

                              <span>Is there a package which automatically and intelligently rewrites variable-name to variableName or variable_name depending on the current major language mode? It should be intelligent enough to account for cases where you&#x27;re typing within the bounds of string quotes. The more I think about this problem the more difficult I think it would be to write such a package --- perhaps none exists.
 As an example, let&#x27;s suppose we&#x27;re writing Python (with | as the cursor):
 Basic:
  
variable-name|
 variable-name |
 variable_name | (conversion performed)
  
In quotes:
  
variable_name &#x27;foo-bar|
 variable_name &#x27;foo-bar |
 variable_name &#x27;foo-bar | (no conversion as the user is typing within quotes)
  
In f-string:
  
variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar-baz|
 variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar-baz |
 variable_name f&#x27;foo {bar_baz | (conversion performed)

                              <span>I often get overwhelmed at the number of things in my TODO list, and end up avoiding looking at it at all.
 I would like to be able to limit the number of TODO&#x27;s displayed there (say 5 TODO&#x27;s), and some way of moving to next/previous 5.
 Is it possible to do it in the regular org-todo-list view?
 Do I need a custom view? if so, how would I do it?

                              <span>Is there any way to separately define bindings for when the right alt/ctrl keys are used as qualifiers (ie treat them differently than the left ones)? google didn&#x27;t provide an obvious answer.
 I never use those keys. I would like to define at least one of them with a whole lot of bindings for entering unicode symbols (for instance, right-alt-A as the &quot;alpha&quot; symbol). I assume I&#x27;d want to set them up to act as &quot;super&quot; or &quot;hyper&quot; in emacs lingo.
 This is under windows, but I&#x27;m also interested in doing the same thing when I&#x27;m running emacs on an AWS linux box (via XMinG under windows).

Is there support for embedded images? (like markdown&#x27;s ![]() image links)
 Is there a reliable way to view/edit Org files on android? Viewing should be rendered, with embedded images, not as plain text.

                              <span>Been digging through documentation and searching the interwebs for the past couple days, looking for a solution but without much luck. The problem is this:
 I tend to have electric-quote-mode enabled when working with text and org files, for the sake of the typographic curly quotes, and I noticed that functions like forward-word and count-words-region are &quot;fooled&quot; into thinking that possessives and contractions are two words instead of one whenever the Right Single Quotation Mark (0x2019) appears inside a word as an apostrophe, becoming a &quot;separator&quot; rather than just part of the word itself.
 The straight-quote apostrophe (0x27) doesn&#x27;t seem to have this problem. I found out that it&#x27;s defined in the text-mode syntax table as a word constituent, so naturally I figured the easy fix would be …</span>

 I have a quick question regarding multiple selections with consult: Helm Buffer has a feature which allows selecting multiple buffers via C-SPC in order to kill those at once with M-D (see here). Does consult-buffer provide a comparable feature? If so, how could I access it? 
 Furthermore, I would like to generalize the question: Given any consult-* command, how can I select multiple items and act on those with the help of embark?
 Thanks in advance!

 I was going to post there, but I think this is more of a general how to question.
 I have a shell script that I&#x27;ve been using as a template for my blog posts. I think, I could rework it to end up as an org file. But I recently watched a System Crafters video on org roam which talks about org-capture-template particularly the template in Org files bit
 if anyone cares about the script here&#x27;s the gist
 is there a way to make an org template for blog posts that would work like org-capture but store the file in path/to/jekyll/_posts
 TL;DR is there a way to make a chord to open an org template for blog posts?

                              <span>On behalf of maintainers I&#x27;m happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.3.0 has been released. It will be a part of upcoming GHC 9.2.2.
 The focus of this release is an extended API for ShortByteString, submitted by /u/maerwald as a part of Abstract FilePath Proposal. bytestring is proud to be a part of this initiative, aimed to provide much faster and more principled FilePath type. Huge thanks to /u/maerwald for spearheading it!
 Other highlights from the changelog:
  
UTF-8 support: add Data.ByteString.Short.isValidUtf8 and use safe FFI for large inputs.
 Improve performance and laziness of unlines.
 Improve performance of intercalate.
 Improve allocations of singleton.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:
  
Alexander Biehl
 askeblad
 Ben Gamari
 Dmitry Ivanov
 Jaro Reinders
 Johannes Waldmann
 Julian Ospald
 Koz Ross
 Matthew Craven
 Patrick Pelletier

On a personal note, it was not easy to work on this release with my family in a bomb shelter and friends in trenches. Stand with Ukraine, will you?

 Then I want to extract client using:  UsersRoutes { usersId &#x3D; fromServant @_ @(AsClientT ClientM) -&gt; UserIdRoutes {..}, ..} &#x3D; genericClient @_ @ClientM 
 GHC politely tells me that fromServant cannot be applied to the pattern, because type mismatches.
 How can I distribute captured id to UserIdRoutes in convenient way when I want to extract client from UsersRoutes using pattern matching?

 It is a pet project of mine written a couple of weeks ago; it was originally for a friend but I felt it would be interesting to get some feedback from the Haskell community, feature requests and, why not, new contributors -- assuming the project is deemed interesting!
 As always, all comments welcome.

                              <span>Sorry if this is a duplicate! I searched the‍ subreddit but didn&#x27;t peer the same question. Is it possible to cache dependency builds with stack or cabal? My use case is creating a docker image that contains a working executable of our project. The build takes forever because of dependencies, it would be great to have it cached as another layer. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So years ago I did a project with Scala and really liked it, and now that I&#x27;m very into functional programming these days I&#x27;ve picked it up again through a course I&#x27;m taking on Akka. I&#x27;ve got a lot more experience with Java &amp; Kotlin than Scala, fyi.
 Anyway, while doing this Akka course I just decided to create a nice simple utility function within an object to abstract away all the boilerplate setup/teardown for actor systems during the course:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.utils // BONUS: Not my main question, but why do we declare packages twice? import akka.actor.ActorSystem import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global object ActorSystemHandler { def useSimpleSystem(name: String, useSystem: ActorSystem &#x3D;&gt; Unit): Unit &#x3D; { val system &#x3D; ActorSystem(name) useSystem(system) system.terminate() .map(_ &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;ActorSystem terminated&quot;)) } } 
 My issue is when i try to use this into one of my lesson objects, like so:
 package io.me.akka package io.me.akka.part2actors import io.me.akka.utils.ActorSystemHandler // This is the line for #2 import akka.actor.{Actor, ActorRef, Props} object ChangingActorBehavior extends App { ActorSystemHandler.useSimpleSystem(&quot;systemName&quot;, system &#x3D;&gt; { // Do stuff with the system }) } 
 There are two main issues that occur:
  
When I type the name ActorSystemHandler, I get the option to auto-import it like usual in IntelliJ. However, when I actually click that option, nothing happens. The IntelliJ auto-import fails to do anything.
 I go ahead and manually add the import statement, as can be seen above. However, &quot;io.me.akka&quot; part of the import is shaded in that grayish color that IntelliJ uses to indicate something is not necessary.
  
I&#x27;m hoping someone can clarify the above points for me. Manually adding the import results in code that will compile/run, but I feel like I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Thanks.

                              <span>From Luhmann&#x27;s article:

  
One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced in the respective other.
If...we seek communication with the second mind, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information).


In digging through the forums, it seems that some believe that Luhmann (and/or the community) overstates the importance of surprise in a Zettelkasten. If you are of this belief, can you enlighten me as to why you make this claim?</span>

                              <span>Hi,
I checked a lot of content on this topic and everyone seems to have his/her own idea on what a zettelkasten is and that makes things extremely confusing when trying to implement it.
I study a lot of computer science content and want to organise it but I am not sure exactly how many folders I should have(some people say two, some three, some four), for what purpose(fleeting notes, literature notes, permanent notes, hub)  and how the notes should be structured and linked.
I apologise if what I wrote above is vague but it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to phrase it.</span>

                              <span>I sometimes read papers and other PDFs on an Android tablet and I want to take notes, annotate or highlight etc.
 At the same time, I&#x27;m developing my note taking workflow using Org mode and Org Roam.
 What&#x27;s the best way to sync the two? I don&#x27;t have a preference for which Android app to use, as long as it allows me to take notes directly on the PDF in a way that can then easily be exported and integrated with the rest of my notes in Emacs.
 I don&#x27;t mind writing a little conversion script if necessary, e.g. to automatically insert some links to my org-roam nodes where possible.
 EDIT: should mention that the notes might also contain pictures

My name is David and for the past three months, Tweag has generously sponsored my work on criterion.rs1. Criterion.rs is a widely used (with nearly 1.4 million downloads in the last 90 days) benchmarking library for the Rust programming language which helps you measure the performance of your code and was inspired by its Haskell namesake2.
I’m a heavy user of criterion.rs as well as one of its maintainers, and three particular pain points have been sticking out like a sore thumb to me. These pain points affect a significant number of people while still being relatively easy to fix, making them, in my opinion, a great fit for Tweag’s Fellowship3 programme which aims to fund Open Source contributions.

                              <span>Since questions of the type “Emacs can&#x27;t find my language server” are quite frequent here, I would like to announce a package that helps with that.
 https://github.com/astoff/buffer-env
 The package works in a manner similar to the direnv program (and is mostly compatible with it). Moreover, it sets the environment variables buffer-locally, so once things are configured everything runs on autopilot and you don&#x27;t need to manually switch between different projects.

                              <span>I am trying to move away from spacemacs to my own config. But I want to have the packages that I have set up. I would like to move away from spacemacs for the sake of flexibility and control. Spacemacs is too late for some of the important items like native comp and their develop branch sometimes has bugs.
 I would like to minimize the changes in my workflow, if I cant keep them the same(keybindings et. al.). Replicating the same environment is proving to be cumbersome due to :
 - Spacemacs setup has too many packages, I am not even 1/4th of the way through and already the literate config is a couple of thousands of lines long.
 - I am used to the keybindings of spacemacs and replicating them is taking too much time. I have already built all the muscle memory and don&#x27;t want a different set of keys.
 - Going through all the documentation of the packages to get the exact setup as I had in spacemacs is very tricky. Sometimes spacemacs has some clever ways of handling things, which needs me to look into spacemacs code.
 - Going over spacemacs code is complex. I am now left with the feeling that I am replicating spacemacs code in my config.
 Has anyone felt the same? how have you dealt with this?

                              <span>Hi, I want to set up my personal development environment for C++ in emacs, and I have a few questions:
 I installed clangd and LSP, and if I open just one .cpp file it&#x27;s all good, but when I bring in multiple headers and files in different directories it doesn&#x27;t know where to find them (of course), how can I fix it? Also, I used to use makefiles, but I read that since clangd uses something called compile_commands.json and CMake can produce them, the latter would be a better option... the problem is that I don&#x27;t know how this whole interaction works and I can&#x27;t find a clear explanation about this on the internet. Lastly, is there a way to use only makefiles instead of CMake, or is it either impossible or impractical?

 When I export my markdown files, it&#x27;s plain text on markdown-mode but If I preview/export on VSCode, it colors everything including syntax highlighting with language aware colors. How do i achieve this on markdown-mode?
 Thanks

I think that I use to click on the error in it was put into *Messages* buffer, but it doesn&#x27;t work like this now.
 Do you know what I have to do to see the type error in a buffer that doesn&#x27;t disappear like with a mini buffer?

                              <span>In my opinion all 3 of those have a natural right to sit on the TAB key:
  
Indentation: It is the tabulator key after all
 Completion: As in TAB-completion in the terminal
 folding: like in orgmode, but most code that has blocks can be folded
  
I don&#x27;t have a good solution for all of them at once. ideally it would support different packages for Indentation/compilation/folding. 
 What do you use?

 As we&#x27;ve reached the end of February(ish), it&#x27;s time for another TMiO post; this time from a non-emacs part of the Org ecosystem (gasp).

 Enjoy!

 Notice that the first hline (horizontal line) is slightly thicker than the others, because it is interpreting the first hline as a column header. 
 Is there any way to stop this?

                              <span>Is there a way to rename links automatically based on the original headline?
 Example:
 * Headline 1 :PROPERTIES: :ID: some_id :END: * Headline 2 - Headline 1 // this is a link using an id * Headline 3 - Headline 1 // this is a link using an id 
 When creating a new internal link, org allows you to specify the text for that link. Is there a way to dynamically change that linking text based on the headline? If I change the text of Headline 1
 to Headline 4, I now want to be able to run a function that can change the text of all links to Headline 4
 Is that possible?
 ​
 I basically need to write a function that will:
 Loop over all internal links. For each link:
  
Get the text from the headline that is linked
 replace the text of the link

                              <span>Hi,
 I have an issue in the new Scala3 docs. Special characters in entities are not escaped when the scala doc is generated, which leads to some issue when hosting the scaladoc on some website like Github Pages. An example would be a class named &quot;~&quot; which generate a file called &quot;~.html&quot; which is not found by Github Pages
 However in previous Scala2 scaladoc the character was escaped with something like &quot;$tilde.html&quot;
 Any idea if it is possible to get this behavior in scala3 ? 
 Here are a working and a flawed example :

Thanks in advance :)

 As a caveat, there is a blockchain / web3 / decentralized layer to what we’re doing. We know that this is contentious for many in the community. So for those with reservations, we understand, however, we think this use-case is legit.

The next release of Emacs, Emacs 29, will come with built-in support for pixel-based scrolling.
 You can enable it using pixel-scroll-precision-mode. 
  
I hadn&#x27;t heard of this. Has anyone used this? Are there any performance issues? In my 5-minute testing I haven&#x27;t noticed any.
 EDIT: According to Emacs&#x27; etc/NEWS, this is what the new mode actually improves in comparison to pixel-scroll-mode:
  ** New minor mode &#x27;pixel-scroll-precision-mode&#x27;. When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse wheel reports. Unlike &#x27;pixel-scroll-mode&#x27;, this mode scrolls the display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line scrolls.

 Enrique here! The consult-project-extra package got recently accepted into MELPA. Nevertheless, expect to also find the package in GNU ELPA in the future, since it only requires packages either built into Emacs or on GNU ELPA (as is consult).
 Please, try the MELPA installation process, and test the functions out. I really appreciate any comments.
 Best,

 Motivation:
 I found the exwm built-in functionality for moving windows between workspaces pretty buggy. If I remember correctly, my major issue was that the built-in functionality only worked for windows displaying exwm buffers but I wanted all windows to be treated equally. I also threw in a completing-read interface that I though I would use but haven&#x27;t found much use for it. Instead I find the functionality to move windows to a specific workspace by number far more useful. 
 ​
 Anyways, feedback welcome. Happy to post to melpa if people find it useful.

 I found emacs-dashboard (dashboard.el) to be a bit to involved for my liking. I wanted a much more minmimalistic splash screen that achived the following goals:
  
Centered text (any arbitrary ascii banner) regardless of the current window size. 
 Used just a single buffer rather than requiring a bunch of duplicate buffers to achive requirement #1. 
 No flashy buttons or other things that I would never bother to click anyways. 
  
​
 Its probably not everyone&#x27;s taste but it does what I need it to. Perhaps others will find it useful. If people want I can put on melpa. 
 Feedback welcome.

                              <span>Following up on my last post about dired-registers, here is a package I recently took over maintenance of. I fixed a bug that was preventing copy and pasting of entire directories recursively. That said, main development was from Hidaka Uchida a number of years back. 
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-copy-paste
 ​
 This is just a really minimalistic (same theme as dired-registers) implementation of a copy-paste interface like Ranger or Ranger.el (just much more minimal). 
 ​
 See Readme on github for more details.

 If people find this useful I will post to melpa.

                              <span>Feedback appreciated. I am new to writing emacs packages for others. So far most of mine have just been written for my own use. If people find this useful, I will post to melpa. 
 ​
 https://github.com/jsilve24/dired-registers
 ​
 Motivation:
 I like emacs bookmarks but I rarely want to create something so permanent to just hold my place when moving between directories (e.g., when copying and pasting files between directories; see dired-copy-paste for more on copying and pasting in dired). This package lower the barrier to keeping your place by implementing registers storing a directory and making it easy to jump back later. Think of these registers like temporary bookmarks that don&#x27;t persist between sessions (just like evil registers).

 See the Readme for more details.

                              <span>If org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks is set to &#x27;invisible, then the asterisks for habits of certain headlines in the agenda display in a greyed-out face (dimmed), rather than the white face I&#x27;m used to. The headlines are those where, in the agenda display, the text of the headline does not reach the beginning of the habit graph. I discovered that lengthening the heading sufficiently (just adding more text) and rebuilding the agenda makes the asterisks white. Removing the extra text and rebuilding again greys them out again.
 I noticed this happening a couple of days ago. What is going? Is this meant to happen, and if not, what can I do about it?

                              <span>I want to start using dotfiles in a bare repo, and commit/pull using magit. I have found the following code to use magit with a bare repo:
 ;; prepare the arguments (setq dotfiles-git-dir (concat &quot;--git-dir&#x3D;&quot; (expand-file-name &quot;~/.dotfiles&quot;))) (setq dotfiles-work-tree (concat &quot;--work-tree&#x3D;&quot; (expand-file-name &quot;~&quot;))) ;; function to start magit on dotfiles (defun dotfiles-magit-status () (interactive) (add-to-list &#x27;magit-git-global-arguments dotfiles-git-dir) (add-to-list &#x27;magit-git-global-arguments dotfiles-work-tree) (call-interactively &#x27;magit-status)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;F5 d&quot;) &#x27;dotfiles-magit-status) ;; wrapper to remove additional args before starting magit (defun magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args () (interactive) (setq magit-git-global-arguments (remove dotfiles-git-dir magit-git-global-arguments)) (setq magit-git-global-arguments (remove dotfiles-work-tree magit-git-global-arguments)) (call-interactively &#x27;magit-status)) ;; redirect global magit hotkey to our wrapper (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args) (define-key magit-file-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-x g&quot;) &#x27;magit-status-with-removed-dotfiles-args) 
 It works great, however, I would like to automatically add/remove the magit-git-global-arguments automatically depending on what directory magit is opened from: adding the bare repo config when in home, and removing it for all others.
 How can I add a hook that detects when magit is about to get launched, and checks the directory, to then either add or remove the flags?

                              <span>I&#x27;m struggling to set the correct font size in Emacs. In Doom, CMD +/- increases/decreases the font size, but the font size is never the same as that of VSCode or iterm - it is either a bit too large or a bit too small. I&#x27;m setting the font size as:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Menlo&quot; :size 12) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;Monaco&quot;) ; inherits &#x60;doom-font&#x27;&#x27;s :size doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family &quot;Courier New&quot; :size 12) doom-big-font (font-spec :family &quot;monospace&quot; :size 19)) 
 Which is same setting as that of VSCode, but VSCode font size appears to be a bit smaller than Emacs (which I prefer). Any tips on how to make the font sizes same? I&#x27;m on Emacs 28.05 native on MacOS Monterey. Thanks in advance!

 It&#x27;s interesting that it has taken several years, or perhaps that it has taken me switching to mu4e as my email client (last few weeks), in addition to my GTD system which has been in org-mode for at least 2 years now.

                              <span>Please excuse the vague language, I&#x27;m really not sure what to search for!
 If I want to move the M-x &quot;popup&quot; to look more like the VSCode drop-down action menu, using Vanilla Emacs, how should I approach that? I&#x27;m using Counsel, if that makes a difference:
 ;; Replace default &quot;M-x&quot; and &quot;C-x C-f&quot; with Counsel version (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-x&quot;) #&#x27;counsel-M-x) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x C-f&quot;) #&#x27;counsel-find-file) 
 Sorry for the really dumb question :/
 My whole init.el if that helps, any constructive criticism welcome! https://gist.github.com/anthonyclarka2/d5e8005b8c5a10ce9ca8b0965f33554e

                              <span>I currently call lp from the terminal to print my pdfs. Is there a better way of doing this from emacs?
 As far as I understood, Emacs provides printing.el lpr.el, and ps-print.el to print text but not pdfs. I use pdf-tools which provides pdf-misc-print-document which I can use to print with lp by setting pdf-misc-print-program-executable and pdf-misc-print-program-args. However, I am looking for &quot;Print Dialog&quot; like package where I can select the (network) printer, the pages, the orientation and the double-sided vs not, etc... 
 I can write a lisp function to query for these, but I am wondering if there are better solutions out there.

                              <span>Hello reddit, its me again.
 I have switched to lsp-pyright and everything is fine except Python documentation functionalities. I wondered if anyone has the same problem as me and I hope that someone can give me some pointers on how to fix this.
 The problem I have is that lsp-doc-show and company-show-doc-buffer return incomplete results for many builtins and many numpy functions. Envoking these commands on list for example returns
 class list() 
 and nothing more.
 I have tried quite a lot and I am pretty confident that it has to do with LSP itself or my LSP setup because anaconda-mode-show-doc yields
 builtins list() list(iterable: Iterable[_T]) Built-in mutable sequence. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list. The argument must be an iterable if specified. 
 which is what I want from LSP.
 Any ideas?

 I might want to define some keys for a purpose, but it&#x27;s also possible that some future package I install could overwrite my definition, right? [EDIT: Or one package clobbering another package.]

                              <span>Hi,
 Would anyone have some recommendation for learning how to programmatically manipulate org-mode with elisp? 
 I don&#x27;t have much elisp knowledge but all the other 3rd party libraries I have found are read-only and could not find anything that allow manipulation of the file itself. 
 I have digged into the source of org-element api but I am left rather confused than anything. 
 I am trying to build an integration with gitlab and orgmode (full project description here) and while I wanted to go with either python or go, I haven&#x27;t found an easy way to modify org files with any of these libraries... 
 So I am trying to go with elisp, which would probably be the most native way to do it, I am just not sure where to start...
 any direction is welcome!

                              <span>This time, without question, I removed all doubt about my connection with reality. I&#x27;ve stuttered and stammered and forgotten the common names of things stumbling along for 20 mins. Confused zettel, note, and file and a PC and a MAC,  and mentioning sideways carrots?( what the hell are those) over and over again. I&#x27;m not getting any better at making videos. Watch this at your own risk. I can&#x27;t be responsible for damages to your DNA? You might get something out of this video that will help your writing.
This combo of the software The Archive and Marked2 are the absolute best writing software combo ever!
A part of the writing process that this video doesn&#x27;t show is the gathering and referencing of the entire ZK when making the zettel that makes up this essay. I habitually run The Archive in two-window mode and keep the right window focused on my work and the left window I use to search my ZK, view PDFs or live preview with Marked2.

Best view in full screen.
https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/c3eV3qVbL9i
The two-window workflow allows you to write and research effectively. It is so efficient that it is fun. The most fun you can have writing!
Try this - for the win!

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a longer piece critiquing the mechanistic view of folgezettel.
&quot;Folgezettel is More than Mechanism&quot;
This article intends to:
Show that the current state of the FZ debate is one mired in a mechanistic reading of folgezettel
Add to the discussion the often overlooked experiential aspects of employing folgezettel
Show how the practice of folgezettel positively influences the note making process
Diversify and broaden the discussion in an effort to show that zettelkasten techniques are more compliments than competitors
From the article:

  
&quot;A mechanistic view is one that privileges the mechanics of a process over the experiential. It ignores the emotional. It tries to establish cohesion often through reductive arguments, determining value (more or less of it) by how parts function together as a system divorced from the subjective experience of the user. As it stands, the folgezettel debate is mired in this mechanistic systems thinking....&quot;</span>

                              <span>@GeoEng51 + @sfast were discussing Markdown editors in another thread and also mentioned Monodraw (which is what I use for my visual structure notes). This might be rehashing an old topic, but I am still curious:
What are your favorite tools adjacent to your Zettelkasten?
by &quot;adjacent&quot; I mean &quot;not your ZK but integral to your knowledge ecosystem&quot;
Broadly, I see three categories for these:
I&#x27;m mostly interested in 3, but any solid arguments for specific ways of handling 1 or 2 to work well with a ZK is welcome. For such arguments for example, why should I download Typora instead of writing in a more general editor like Atom?</span>

 I know that map helps you apply a function to a list. How do we work with a list of lists?

                              <span>Hi, I have this function which solves this problem: https://purdue.kattis.com/problems/trainsorting. solve is the naive recursive version and solve&#x27; is the DP version. I used the method shown on the Haskell wiki to construct the DP matrix. 
 The algorithm works, but its runtime scales with the bounds of the matrix, so it takes a prohibitively long time with bounds higher than 1000 or so. I don&#x27;t understand why though, since I can tell by the trace that it only calculates the required elements. My first thought is that it has to preallocate the array, but I tried it with a Data.Map as well for the same result.
 Any explanation is appreciated

                              <span>Using Haskell has made me think about imperative languages differently. An interesting thing to think about is that the “async/await” patterns of these languages mirror monad patterns in Haskell with do-notation. The “await” keyword with “var x &#x3D; await …” is just like “x &lt;- …” in Haskell. And Future is really just a monadic type! Perhaps one day we’ll see an imperative language implement true monads and do asynchrony in terms of them.

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 So... I have a doubt related to the usage of for comprehension...
 Lets imagine that I have an User type that is the product of UserId, UserName and UserEmail and each of them contains its own validations, right?
 So lets imagine that my value called UserName looks like this:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala final case class ValidationError(message: String)
 final case class UserName private(name: String)
 type UserNameFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[ValidationError, UserName]
 object UserName { def fromString(rawName: String): UserNameFactoryResult &#x3D; ... // some validation blabla } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now I am trying to think about the factory for the User entity inside of my object companion.
 I want to use somekind of for-comprehension but I dont have any idea on how to mix the for-comprehension with my either results
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala case class User(id: UserId, name: UserName, email: UserEmail)
 type UserFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[List[ValidationError], User]
 object User { def createFromStrings(rawId: String, rawName: String, rawEmail: String): UserFactoryResult &#x3D; { val eitherUser &#x3D; for { id &lt;- UserId.fromString(rawId) // this can be Left or Right name &lt;- UserName.fromString(rawName) // this can be Left or Right email &lt;- UserEmail.fromString(rawEmail) // this can be Left or Right } yield new Right(User(id, name, email)) } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 well well... what I need to do with this code is to find a way to CORRECTLY returns EITHER a List with each error that happened in those type values EITHER my valid User with its correct values.
 what should I do? what is the cleanest way of doing this with pure scala 3? can I avoid nesting pattern match inside this for-comprehension? how to go on with this?

                              <span>Hello guys! I am a front-end web developer, tired of JS-TS.
 First of all, I am not familiar with Scala and its ecosystem, so, sorry about that.
 I own a startup which is close to make a deal with an organization for a serious project.
 I always search for viable JS alternatives and really like Scala as a language (even though I have no experience with it).
 For the last 2 days I am researching on how to embrace Scala-js. I managed to gather some information. 
 Concern no 1: interop with the JS ecosystem. Solution: scalably-typed
 Concern no 2: react bindings. Solution: Slinky
 Concern no 3: bundler. Solution: Not so sure, but I&#x27;ve found scalajs-bundler which works with webpack, but I am unsure about the integration with Concern no 4 bellow.
 Concern no 4: Monorepo setup-build system. 
 If anyone is familiar with JS ecosystem, there is the nx.dev monorepo managing tool which has the features I need for this project, which will be structured with a feature based folder structure.
 What I need:
  
apps folder containing 3 applications which will share many libraries-modules from the libs folder mention bellow 
  libs folder which will contain feature based modules, for reuse across the 3 apps
  
Something like this:
 apps/
 ├─ app-1/
 ├─ app-2/
 ├─ app-3/
 libs/
 ├─ feature-1/
 ├─ feature-3/
 ├─ feature-4/
 ├─ feature-2/
 ​
 How can I achieve this? Anyone with experience with something similar?
 As a reminder, those 3 apps and libs will target JS, and will need a bundler.
 Is it possible to only build the affected apps when changing some feature on libs folder?
 Even if it is possible, how maintainable will it be?
 Thank you for your answers!

 In particular, I&#x27;m looking for Scala 3 compatible ORM/RDBMS libraries, and JSON libraries that include macros for deriving codecs. Up until now I&#x27;ve been hand writing codecs for small scale Scala 3 projects and using Java based ORMs, but I feel it&#x27;s been long enough to give native libraries another look.

                              <span>I am experimenting with Doom Emacs but it feel like performance is at least as bad as it was with my hand-rolled config. I am running 28.0.91 with native comp on Mojave.
 The stated startup time on the splash screen is normally 2-3 seconds: &quot;Doom loaded 208 packages across 34 modules in 2.06 seconds&quot;. Restoring my previous workspace with 20-30 buffers takes 7-8 seconds. Opening a file in a project takes 1-2 seconds. At first I thought it was due to LSP mode, but it&#x27;s still slow even with it disabled.
 I have followed some of the recommendations in Doom&#x27;s README &quot;why is Doom slow?&quot;, but my situation seems a bit more pathological than what those try to address. 
 I tried profiling opening a single line file (took a second or two) and the CPU profile says that it spent 28% of its time in automatic GC and 51% of its time in vertico--advice. I&#x27;m assuming that was the file selection popup, so it appears that Emacs is really just spending all its time waiting for something. I&#x27;d be grateful for advice how to debug further.

                              <span>Hi
 I&#x27;m looking to enhance my writing experience by dragging text around.
 In Org-mode, dragging the current paragraph (or subtree, or list item) up and down is easy with M-up and M-down.
 I&#x27;m an Evil user, so for swapping two regions, there&#x27;s evil-exchange.
 Is there a package that would allow me to drag the current region up or down? Or perhaps right or left, along the same line? Or does anyone have any pointers on how to best write something that achieves this?
 Cheers

 I imagine, if this is even possible, I would need to bind my own key chord to a which-key command, something like this:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-M-\&#x60;&quot;) #&#x27;which-key-show-top-level) 
 But that only shows the top level commands (for the current major mode?). Or perhaps there&#x27;s another package that does this?

                              <span>tl;dr: Org-capture window closes in i3wm for no reason, how to debug or identify the problem?
 Hi! A beginner user, I use emacs-client 26.3 and Emacs 27.2 with org-capture on Ubuntu 20.4 running i3wm. (Could version mismatch be the problem?) I append text of an org-capture template to an org file. I probably misconfigured something and have these problems:
  
Launching a new window of org-capture from i3wm (triggered by a keystroke) works, but the window closes unexpectedly after some 10-50 seconds, often before I finish writing a note in the template and the work is lost. But if I type fast enough and complete C-c C-c before crash then all is good. What would be the log file I should look into? What could cause this?

 As the question asks, where is the variable global-map initially filled with values ? It is defined in subr.el as nil and many keys are defined in bindings.el. However, I seem to miss something because I can&#x27;t for instance find where letters are bound to self-insert-command.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi, all. Some of you might&#x27;ve seen my last post on Vertico, Marginalia, All-the-icons-completion, and Orderless last week.
 I present to you my small configuration for Corfu, Kind-icon, and Corfu-doc, which greatly complement the packages in that previous post by enhancing the built-in completion-at-point.
 Sometime in the near future, I&#x27;ll be trying to show my (messy) way of utilizing the cape package&#x27;s completion-at-point backends.
 Cheers!

                              <span>I have an intermediate level knowledge of bash scripting and use of the linux command line.I know given enough time i could eventually become a power user but my dilemma is this: im also falling deeper in love with emacs. The more i read about it the more i get the feeling that it would be much more time-efficient to just master emacs and forego going deeper down the rabbit holes of bash shell scripting and the various Gnu utilities and .etc. It seems to me that with emacs I pretty much get a entire environment in which all packages,commands,config files and etc are all written in one language(e lisp). So that being said, can I just go &quot;all in&quot; on learning emacs and e lisp and just more or less ignore bash scripting and learning more about the various linux terminal commands?

                              <span>I have Haskell installed via GHCup and it works just fine in the command prompt. The trouble is VSCode integration. It worked previously, but after updating to vscode version 1.64.2, HLS stopped working with error libHSghc-prim-0.7.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 I&#x27;ve tried reinstalling/updating GHC and HLS but the issue remains. I couldn&#x27;t find any information about this issue and was hoping someone else could assist.
 GHC version - 8.10.7
 HLS version - 1.6.1.0

 What is your current favorite package for using free monads (either directly or in the spirit of) to implement EDSLs?

                              <span>Hello all! I&#x27;m currently implementing a source code formatter using prettyprinter and ran into a situation that I can&#x27;t get over.
 The assembly of the Doc is performed in the context of a state Monad, as I need to keep track of some state as I go on:
  type StateDoc &#x3D; State MyState (Doc ()) 
 This works fine, I have individual functions that assemble different parts of the document:
  fortmatPartA :: DataA -&gt; StateDoc fortmatPartB :: DataB -&gt; StateDoc fortmatPartC :: DataC -&gt; StateDoc  It the end when I put the document together, parts A, B and C are to be arranged on top of each other vertically:
 vsep  sequence [formatPartA dataA, formatPartB dataB, formatPartC dataC]
 Now the problem that I&#x27;m having is that formatPartB and formatPartC can return an emptyDoc, which can result in something like [PartADoc, emptyDoc, PartBDoc]. This is a problem because emptyDocs have a height of 1 and will introduce an unwanted newline in the final document. I would like to completely ignore the part of the document if it returns emptyDoc.
 Does someone have an idea of how I can achieve this?
 I thought about not using emptyDoc at all, but Maybe instead:
 formatPartB :: DataB -&gt; State MyState (Maybe (Doc ()))
 but how could I implement the &quot;excluding&quot; logic that ignores the Nothings? Is there something like a mapMaybe or catMaybe for Monads? Maybe I&#x27;m missing something obvious.
 Thanks a lot for your help and happy haskelling :)

                              <span>The PureScript team has launched the language&#x27;s first annual survey! This survey will help the core team learn more from the community about how we can improve the language and the ecosystem around it. If you&#x27;ve used PureScript before, please take the time to fill out this survey:
 https://surveyhero.com/c/wzajwjpd
 Even if you have never written PureScript, we want to hear from you! There&#x27;s a short section specifically for non-users.
 If you can share this survey with your peers and communities that would also be super helpful.
 Thanks for your time and we look forward to hearing your thoughts!

                              <span>I&#x27;m literally 10 minutes into my adventures with PureScript, so I know almost nothing and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some very obvious things! But I&#x27;m working through the book at https://book.purescript.org/ and am wondering why the code and tests all produce a bunch of warnings?
 For example, one warning I see for the Chapter 2 code is:
  
No type declaration was provided for the top-level declaration of ns
  
I&#x27;m working in VSCode and have v0.14.7 of purs (and generally the latest versions of everything as far as I know). Maybe the book would prefer me to use an older version of the compiler?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am working on a software project which I am organizing my tasks in a hierarchical structure where a top level heading is a general feature and the sub headings are tasks that need to be done concerning that feature.
 This is very simple so far, what I would like to add now is a milestone tag so I can associate some features with a specific version, this is a very common approach in software development as far as I know. The problem is that when I write a tag containing dots, org-mode considers the dots as tag separators, so I cannot write a tag as the following :v1.0: because it would be replaced with :v1:0:.
 If anyone has any workaround for this let me know. Or if you have any other suggestions I would like to give them a try, I myself thought about some alternatives but I would first want to know if I can do it the way I want.

Similarly if I open emacs, check the variable, (again,habits&#x60; is present in the list) and then open the agenda the graphs display, but if I don&#x27;t check the variable they don&#x27;t.
 Am I doing something wrong or is this a report-worthy bug?

                              <span>I know any such statistics would be rough, just wondering if there&#x27;s a way to see something like this.
  
EDIT: Answered by /u/yyoncho: &quot;You can sort by downloads on melpa.org&quot;. So here&#x27;s an example of how I&#x27;m using it. As an emacs newbie, I&#x27;m interested in installing some package, let&#x27;s say ido mode, but I&#x27;m also interested in the dozen or so related packages (containing &quot;ido-&quot;). But it&#x27;s hard to get a sense of their popularity, age, etc. 
 So I downloaded the list of all packages from melpa.org, sorted by download count, and made it into a tab-delimited file: Here&#x27;s the gist link to my text file.. Then I grep that to get only the &quot;ido-&quot; packages:
 Download count Name Description Release Repository &quot;482,602&quot; smex M-x interface with Ido-style fuzzy matching. 20151212.2209 github &quot;290,389&quot; …</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t2sy6e/newbie_csret_seems_counterintuitive_in_this_case/">

                              <span>Given this structure (Example 1), if point is anywhere in the line Proj1 (Level 1) and I hit C-S-RET, it will create a new &quot;Level 1&quot; TODO heading just before Proj2 (Level 1)
  
Example 1
 * Proj1 (Level 1) &lt;-- IF POINT IS ANYWHERE HERE * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * Proj2 (Level 1) &lt;-- C-S-RET INSERTS &quot;* TODO&quot; JUST BEFORE HERE AT LEVEL 1 * Proj2 H1 (Level 2) 
 
 But if they are folded and point is after ellipses:
  
Example 2
 * PROJ1...x &lt;-- point at space marked x * Proj2... 
 
 When I hit C-S-RET I get this:
  
Example 3 
 * PROJ1... * TODO * Proj2... 
 
 That TODO has two invisible parents, which obscures it&#x27;s context, which is shown unfolded here:
  
Example 4 
 * Proj1 (Level 1) * Proj1 H1 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 (Level 2) * Proj1 H2 Note (Level 3) blah blah * Another Note (Level 4) blah blah * TODO (Level 4) &lt;-- TODO ADDED HERE * Proj2 (Level 1) 
 
 Why does C-S-RET add a TODO exactly 3 levels deeper in this case? Why not any of the following alternatives: 
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
 At level 5 (depth first traversal of tree)
  
What is &quot;magical&quot; about 3 levels deeper? What are some ways for a typical beginner to deal with this? Maybe &quot;never use C-S-RET after ellipses&quot;? I certainly don&#x27;t want to memorize that rule. Or is there some control variable?
 I think that a sane default would be one of the following:
  
At level 1 (same as not folded)
 At level 2 (immediate child)
  
Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!

 The one issue I&#x27;m running into is that if I mark messages in my inbox with &quot;refile&quot; (&quot;r&quot; in evil mode) and then execute the command, it appears that the command executed correctly. However, when I then jump to my Archive folder, I don&#x27;t see any of the emails.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done so far to troubleshoot. If I manually look for the messages in a terminal by going into my mu maildir, I can see the archived messages. Additionally if I run &#x60;mu find some-message&#x60; I can see emails in the Archive directory. If I send my self a new email and then archive it, I can see it in emacs.

Informing clangd about the project sources for better finding include files
 Finding compilation toolkits for MSYS2 (Windows) and Unix variants (in progress)
 Configuration of the project via cmake
 Building (compiling) the project with highlighting of errors
 Installing
 Unit testing with ctest
  
As usual, this is provided with no guarantees. It seems to be working on my Windows machine (with native Emacs, no WSL), but your mileage may vary. Feedback and pull requests welcome. Also help in integrating MSVC compilers and other toolkits.

 Hello fellow emacsians. I am in the very happy position to announce to you, my first ever contribution to emacs (besides helping people with emacs here and in other forums), in the form of a new package for emacs called zetteldesk.el. It is by no means done, I have things I want to add, and I am certain its also not perfect, but its usable, and to an extent polished so I thought I would release it. I am just an engineer who loves to take his notes with org-roam, so forgive me if some code isn&#x27;t written in the best version.
 ​
 The name zetteldesk derives from a mix of the words zettelkasten and desktop. I shortened it because zettelkasten-desktop was too large. zetteldesk.el is a tool I made, built primarily on top of org-roam - b…</span>

                              <span>My needs are just to write or edit simple code in C++, Python and Rust; And to maintain a lot of markdown, xml and text files. 
 Trying to find the &quot;best&quot; ide and corresponding plugins for each programming language was just annoying to me. For eg. IntelliJ IDEA is great for Rust, but doesn&#x27;t have an easy C++ support. 
 Thus my decision to switch to something like emacs or vim, which would have all-round support. 
 I completed the tutorial and immediately felt how convenient it would be to navigate around without having to take your hands off the keyboard. 
 I want to now continue to set up Emacs so that I can conveniently use it for the above needs. I&#x27;m setting it up in Manjaro Linux. 
 Do you all have any tips?

                              <span>Hey folks, how are u doing?
 Im a converting a Try to Either but IDK how to pass my own Type Alias so I can compile.
 Example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala
 type UserIdFactoryResult &#x3D; Either[ValidationError, UserId]
 object UserId { private def apply(id: String): UserId &#x3D; new UserId(id) ... def fromString(rawId: String): UserIdFactoryResult &#x3D; { ... case Some(rawId) &#x3D;&gt; { // I need to return UserIdFactoryResult here Try(UUID.fromString(rawId)) .transform( success &#x3D;&gt; Success(Right(this.apply(success.toString))), error &#x3D;&gt; Success(Left(error)) ).get .... } } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But the problem is that this transformation returns an Either[Throwable, UserId] instead of UserIdFactoryResult...
 What should I do?

I&#x27;m trying out a new date format for the title of this thread. Let me know what you think. Are we starting this tread on a bad day? Maybe starting on Monday or Thursday would make more sense?
Please share what small or large ZK successes you had in the past week. Please share your plans are for this coming week. Use this as a public responsibility thread. Use it to hold yourself accountable. Use this as a way to start a conversation.

Last Week
Impermanence is all around me. Everything I see is a temporary arrangement of atoms soon dispersed and reassembled into new arrangements. My attention is also always temporary. Attention flitters from one object to another in a time frame that speeds up and slows just a little from the moment of awakening to after fully sleeping. Even then, dreams grab my attention.
I successfully integrated The Archive/Marked2/Zotero/Pandoc toolchain into my writing environment.

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;ve lurked around here on and off for a few years, and Zettelkasten was always in my head somewhere as a &#x27;will do that someday&#x27;. Well more and more I find myself knowing-but-not-quite some fact or info, or knowing that I know it, but not the full details that I knew at one point, or references or sources for looking it up.
So I decided to take the plunge and implement a zettelkasten system for myself. But as I investigated it I became intrigued by the simple yet powerful idea of notes and links, and decided to try to distill (my interpretation of) its essence into a new app. Yes, the cliche of the software dev who discovers zettelkasten and makes an app. However, I think mine has some advantages. For one thing I&#x27;m intentionally keeping it quite spartan–no endless customizability…</span>

I might be going about this the absolute wrong way but I&#x27;ve never used a language like this before and I&#x27;m getting very lost. 
 Assignment:
 Write a Haskell program that generates the list of all the subsets of the set [1..n] that have as many elements as their complements.
 For the set [1,2,3,4] the output should look like this:
 [([1,2],[3,4]),
 ([1,3],[2,4]),
 ([1,4],[2,3]),
 ....] 
 I&#x27;m currently creating a list from 1-n where n is 6.
 I&#x27;m retrieving all of the subsequences of that list.
 let n &#x3D; 6 let set &#x3D; [1..n] let ordered &#x3D; sortWith length $ subsequences set 
 I don&#x27;t understand how to only get the list of the length of 3 out of this list of lists. What would be the best way to get the list of that length? Thank you for any input! I believe I can figure out the compliment on my own. I just don&#x27;t know how to get the certain lists I need.

                              <span>Suppose I start with this, with point on letter J:
  
Example 1
 * PROJECTS... * Inbox... 
 
 I want this
  
EXAMPLE 2 [EDIT: Actually, this is impossible with org-indent-mode on.]
 * PROJECTS... x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 What&#x27;s the standard way and/or the most efficient way to get there? Or alternatively, achieve this:
  
Example 3
 * PROJECTS... * x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 I know that if I start with Example 1 and I press C-S-RET, I&#x27;ll get this:
  
Example 4
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 That&#x27;s good enough for TODO&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to do something similar for the other cases. But it&#x27;s odd that it leaves a space there (why does it do that?). I&#x27;d rather it not, but I&#x27;ll accept this standard behavior, for now, if that&#x27;s just the way it works out-of-the-box. (I know I can change emacs to do whatever I want though.) Also, the C-S-RET behaves a little different if the point starts at the end of * Projects...x at space marked x. In that case, it creates something like this:
  
Example 5
 * PROJECTS... * TODO x &lt;--- point here at space marked x * Inbox... 
 
 In Example 5, it creates a new TODO item under the last child entry of * PROJECTS, but leaving * PROJECTS otherwise folded. Isn&#x27;t it a little odd to have an intermediate parent invisible? 
 Finally, does that last point position (marked x here:* Projects...x) have special meaning/purpose? Is there a name for that position?
 EDIT: I think some of my questions about the functionality of ellipses and spaces is probably related to this timely post: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t1r2wq/have_you_ever_wondered_how_orgmode_toggles_the/. Which, from a newbie perspective, is probably summed up as &quot;Because reasons.&quot;

 This mode gives the ability to execute the just recipies from within the editor itself.

 I have swtiched to using straight.el because org-mode was complaining about switching repos and I really enjoy the flexibility if offers in selecting pacakages from sources such as Github. Recently, however, I have noticed that when I load any file .org file I get the following message:
  File mode specification error: (error Autoloading file /home/thomas/.emacs.d/straight/build/org/org.elc failed to define function org) 
 This error occurs every time an org file is loaded. I have found I can suppress the error by simply commenting out the line (org-agenda-files &#x60;(&quot;~/Dropbox/gtd&quot;)) in my init.el file.
 This works well, however, my favorite feature of org-mode is the agenda and this essentially breaks that feature. I cannot for the life of me fi…</span>

 The first idea was to get the remainder of the window-width divided by the current line length,
 (- (window-width) (% (length (thing-at-point &#x27;line)) (window-width))) 
 It just doesn&#x27;t work, cause line break happened between spaces.

                              <span>Hi, some buffers can be deleted/hiddden using &quot;q&quot;, like help buffers etc (they probably have a name).
 xwidget seems to disapear (but its only hidden) and when its hidden it always shows another buffer instead. How can I configure this to actually quit the buffer and delete the window?
 This is my function for splitting and showing the browser on the right.
 (defun mk/browser-split-window (url &amp;optional new-window) &quot;Create a new browser window to the right of the current one.&quot; (interactive) (let* ((ignore-window-parameters t) (dedicated-p (window-dedicated-p))) (delete-other-windows) (split-window-horizontally) (other-window 1) (xwidget-webkit-browse-url url))) 
 Looks nice - now lets close it using \&quot;q\&quot;
 Hmm not really what I wanted.
 My complete config can be found here: https://github.com/konrad1977/emacs
 And as a bonus I have another question:
 How do I setup emacs to always set focus to (other-window 1) when a new window is created?
 Thanks!

 https://i.imgur.com/K7340jK.png
 Now my questions are as follows:
  
I thought org files were visible text only files, editable in any other text editor. But it&#x27;s clearly saving the highlight features with the text. How is it doing that? What is the format?
 
If I end up with something like this on the right again, how can I strip all the highlight formatting, so I get back to what&#x27;s shown on the left?

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how org-mode toggles the visibility of headings?
 YES!!! me either!
 Let&#x27;s get into it ;)
 Table of content:
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 text properties
 Why are we talking about text properties if the mechanism of outline-mode uses overlays?
 overlays, invisible overlay property, buffer-invisibility-spec 
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to t
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to nil
 buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo) t)
 
 ellipsis and buffer-invisibility-spec equal to ((foo . t) t) 
 default ellipsis ...
 custom ellipsis modifying the display table
 
  
org-mode visibility of headings
 org-mode is built on top of outline-mode that is responsible of the visibility changes of the headings.
 How does it work?
 outline-mode uses overlays, specifically the o…</span>

It organizes the APIs into categories nicely, so I can quickly find out the exact APIs that I want, and then I look up them inside Emacs using Help, Info, etc.
 But the page was gone last year (I can&#x27;t remember the exact date), the content was gone, although the URL was still reachable. What a pity!
 Do you know why it was gone? I didn&#x27;t find an alternative to it after that. If you know the maintainer or maintainers, would you like to tell him/her/them about the issue? Thanks!
 If you were also like me, the good news is that we can visit its backup on Wayback Machine, https://web.archive.org/web/20201202092534/https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp_Cheat_Sheet, thanks to the Internet Archive!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve used Monoids in the fp-ts TypeScript library, which is where I learned most of my FP skills. I&#x27;m now diving into Scala and looking to re-use all the constructs I learned over there.
 Anyway, I installed Scalaz and now I&#x27;ve got a list to concatenate into a single value. Sounds easy enough, let&#x27;s just use a Monoid.
 Based on fp-ts, I was expecting the append() function of the Monoid to have a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: String): String 
 When, as you already know, it actually has a signature like this:
 override def append(f1: String, f2: &#x3D;&gt; String): String 
 I&#x27;m not even sure what the type of the second argument is supposed to be, let alone how to use this to concatenate my list into a single value.
 Help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 I&#x27;ve been using it myself for a bit, and I felt it reached the stage where it&#x27;s as ready for public consumption as it&#x27;ll ever be. I&#x27;d be interested to know if there are other interested in data visualisation out of scala code... It&#x27;s young, and follows a different paradigm to some of the Prior Art. Feedback, observations and interest welcomed.

 type Equivalence[A] &#x3D; A &#x3D;&gt; A &#x3D;&gt; Boolean 
 But I don&#x27;t understand which type of functor will fit such type here. Briefly, Equivalence looks like a contravariant function with a negative position in input, but in practice, I cannot assemble contravariant functor:
  val coFunctorForEq &#x3D; new ContravariantFunctor[Equivalence] { override def contraMap[A, B](fa: Equivalence[A])(f: B &#x3D;&gt; A): Equivalence[B] &#x3D; (b: B) &#x3D;&gt; b &#x3D;&gt; fa(f(b))(???) } 
 Do I understand correct, that I need invariant functor here?

I just upgraded to The Archive 1.7.6 (202) and noticed that we can now &quot;drag and drop&quot; images into a zettle.  The image will automatically be copied to the media sub-folder within your ZK folder, the reference will be inserted into your zettel, and the image will appear - presto!
That is so much easier than copying the image to your media file and then typing the reference in your zettel.
Thank you so much for this timesaver!!!  It is such a cool feature    (Sometimes little things make a big difference)</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been using org-mode for writing articles for a while. And I recently tried RMarkdown. I am trying to decide which one to use in the future. 
 I really enjoy org-mode. The only problem for me is that since I do not do programming, I do not know any computer language. I have to copy and paste settings by other people for different purposes, such as spelling check, formatting, preview, etc. RMarkdown in RStudio sets up things for me and I can download some packages by others without any specific setup. 
 I also feel that I do not fully use amazing functions of org-mode. For example, while I really like the to-do list and agenda, I do not know how to seamlessly synchronize my calendar (Mac OS) and my org-mode agenda. Many of my meetings are scheduled by others sending me .ics files. I can just go to my calendar and click &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;decline&quot;. Is there a way to automatically make the item appear in my org-mode agenda when I add items on my apple calendar? 
 Anyway, maybe too much information here. Just curious to see others&#x27; experience of using org-mode for academic writing.

                              <span>At the moment, GHC has some machinery for tracking (annotating and inferring) the roles of parameters to type constructors. Roles and their machinery do not appear to be first class, in that it is not possible to discuss the roles of parameters to higher kinded type variables. This is a bit annoying, because in the absence of the ability to discuss such things one has to explicitly carry around coercion dictionary baggage.
 The &quot;role&quot; of a parameter roughly encodes the sort of &quot;equality functor&quot; the type-level function is. Specifically, the role of some type constructor&#x27;s parameter determines what kind of equivalence it needs as input in order to produce a representational equivalence as output. If it requires _, the parameter has a _:
  
definitional equality, nominal role
 representational equivalence, representational role
 codiscrete equivalence (any two things are equal), phantom role
  
So it seems to me that properly speaking, the role actually belongs to the -&gt; in the kind of the type constructor in question. Namely we have three different variations:
  
haskell type Nominal :: Type -{NOM}-&gt; Type data Nominal x where Nominal :: Nominal Int 
 haskell type Representational :: Type -{REP}-&gt; Type data Representation x &#x3D; Representational x 
 haskell type Phantom :: Type -{FAN}-&gt; Type data Phantom x &#x3D; Phantom 
  
Similar systems of inference, notation, &quot;subtyping&quot; etc. could be devised to the ones for linear function arrows (which occur at the type level), so that working with these things is not very painful. It might also make sense to think of &quot;role polymorphism&quot;, although I personally haven&#x27;t given this much thought.
 What do you folks think? Am I missing something obvious?
 EDIT: The Reddit editor ate half my post and I had to rewrite it, apologies to anyone who saw the truncated version.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a PoC literately programmed python project and cannot for the life of me figure out how to have LSP-based completion inside noweb blocks. There is a sort of pseudocode block with a few references to chunks that come later, and I would like to have completion while writing these chunks somehow. Editing the :noweb yes chunk of code using C-c &#x27; does not seem to expand the noweb references at all, which is not ideal. The blocks themselves also don&#x27;t have completion when I tangle the :noweb yes block to a file and use lsp-org.
 Both of those solutions feel like they should work, so it is possible I&#x27;ve run into a bug because I&#x27;m running gccemacs. Is this the case? Is it normal for noweb and lsp-based completion for python to just work inside of your org file?
 I&#x27;m very much hoping I&#x27;m just doing something wrong, as the potential of this style when writing code for high-turnover teams with mixed capabilities seems very high to me. I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be possible to instigate such a culture change without code completion.

 In this screenshot, the color I&#x27;m talking about is the gray background of the first item in the list of choices:

                              <span>Hej Hej,
 This [https://gitlab.com/OlMon/consult-flyspell] is a small package to collect all misspelled words in a buffer and display it with consult.
 This package was born because I wanted to have a nice display of all my mistakes. I know kinda sadistic...
 I tried the great package flycheck-aspell/flymake-aspell [https://github.com/leotaku/flycheck-aspell]. It has almost everything I need, but for my 11 year old notebook it was a little bit to much. Additionally I was not sure if I would only use aspell and not switch to hunspell at some day.
 In the consult issue &quot;command wishlist&quot; it is stated:
 &quot;consult-flyspell, provided by see https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct, [...]&quot;
 That is correct, flyspell-correct displays the correction in the minibuffer, consult-flyspell displays the misspelled words in the minibuffer.
 I actually use both packages and set the variable consult-flyspell-correct-function to flyspell-correct-at-point to jump to a word and correct it.
 Maybe it helps someone, or maybe I did something that already existed, then please let me know.
 Cheers,
 OlMon

When writing my own functions, I&#x27;ve been doing two message calls, but sometimes those messages will appear one after the other even if nothing has appeared between them.
 Is there a function, macro, or some other pattern to keep in mind to copy the behavior with several built-in Emacs functions? Or is it some built-in magic that I&#x27;m not going to really be privvy to?

 How to prevent this behavior?

 Would there happen to be any utilities to execute entire org-mode files, similar to bashup&#x27;s mdsh? This allows users to execute markdown files via bash. I&#x27;d like to combine it with a nix-shell shebang!
 Thank you kindly for the help!

                              <span>At some point in I think 2021, read-extended-command-predicate was added, which lets you filter what M-x shows you. One of the intended use cases is to prevent commands for one major mode from showing up when working in another major mode. It&#x27;s nil by default, but you can (setq read-extended-command-predicate &#x27;command-completion-default-include-p)... except for the fact that basically no package I can find actually uses this, either by using
 (defun foo () (declare (modes . (lisp-mode))) (interactive) (message &quot;I only show up in some-mode&quot;)) 
 or by (put &#x27;foo &#x27;command-modes &#x27;(lisp-mode)). I&#x27;d like to go through all the commands whose names start with (say) python- and mark them as being python-mode commands. What&#x27;s the easiest way to do that?
 PS, is there any downside to package authors doing this? The declare variation warns on older versions of emacs, but the put variation should work no matter what. I&#x27;m really surprised this has almost no adoption/conversation that I could find. Out of all the packages I have cloned locally, only transient uses it, and only vertico and other packages by the same author use the related completion-predicate property.

                              <span>Hello. In a normal org source block for LaTex, I can view the source with org-edit-src-code. So the org headers are #+begin_src latex and #+end_src
 This will open a new window where my autocomplete package, in this case yassnippet, can autocomplete base on key words. For example, while inside the editting source code mode, I can type &quot;eq&quot; and TAB and automatically a LaTex snippet for equation is inserted. 
 For my case, sometimes I need to use an export block, so #+begin_export latex and #+end_export. How can I autocomplete in this case? Obviously, org-edit-src-code does not work because it is not an &quot;src&quot; block but an &quot;export&quot; block. 
 Any input is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to use the dabbrev for every file where connected to our git project.
 I wrote it to use every buffer (just for testing):
 (defun my/dabbrev-select-buffer (other-buffer)
  &#x60;(eq 1 1))&#x60; &#x60;(setq dabbrev-friend-buffer-function #&#x27;my/dabbrev-select-buffer)&#x60; 
 But it isn&#x27;t working.
 How can I set it up well ?

                              <span>Some time ago I created a very simple sbt plugin to generate arbitrary configuration files. It&#x27;s pretty much a copy of sbt-github-actions. The only difference is that it is not limited to GitHub Actions configurations, but can generate all kinds of text files. The key feature is that the plugin is able to verify that the generated configs are up-to-date in CI (just like sbt-github-actions).
 Since I&#x27;ve noticed how incredibly useful this plugin has become for me, I thought I&#x27;d share it here to show it to a wider audience (:
 I tend to use it for deployment configs, generating dev environment Dockerfiles and unopinionated GitHub Actions configs.

                              <span>I use the logging functionality of todo state changes with todo keywords like
 +todo: [☛]TODO(t) [&gt;]Started(s!) [☀]Current(c) | [✔]DONE(d!) +todo: [⚑]WAITING(w!) | +todo: | [✘]CANCELED(x!) 
 However, I would like the time stamps being generated to be less verbose. Currently they are something like: - State &quot;[⚑]WAITING&quot; from &quot;[☛]TODO&quot; [2022-02-24 Thu 10:10]. However I don&#x27;t really care about the time part of it. I&#x27;d just like something with the year, month, and day like: - State &quot;[⚑]WAITING&quot; from &quot;[☛]TODO&quot; [2022-02-24 Thu]. Is this something that is configurable?

 I plan to organise an online meeting aiming to hunt performance issues with latest Org mode. If you are ready to share screen and do interactive debugging, feel free to join. I will post a jisti link in Org mode ML [1] 1 hour before the meeting.

If you are using emacs, execute the code-block(s) when it makes sense to you. You can use this document to set up a running AI robot dog on your /Computer/. #+END_QUOTE 
 I use spacemacs and perform an export with SPC e e H h (running Export to Hugo-compatible Markdown, file to Md file). This creates a file hugo/content/posts/README.md like I expect.

 Infuriatingly, the actual RESULTS don&#x27;t make it into the final output. How can I get the #+RESULTS: rendered into a

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Out of the box, calling org-store-link when point is on a headline displayed on an agenda view behaves as you would expect: it does much what it would have done had you called org-store-link from an org-mode buffer visiting the relevant file with point on the same headline. But if you set org-agenda-sticky to t , calling org-store-link from an agenda buffer gives the following error:
 user-error: No method for storing a link from this buffer 
 After digging around a bit I think I found the culprit: for the agenda relevant behavior of org-store-link to be activated, you need to be in a buffer with the name specified in org-agenda-buffer-name. On my end, org-agenda-buffer-name is set to *Org Agenda*, but when org-agenda-sticky is set to t, agenda buffers have a different name of the form *Org Agenda(VIEW)*, where VIEW is the key to the relevant agenda view (so, e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*).
 Now, if I set org-agenda-buffer-name to e.g. *Org Agenda(a)*, I get org-store-link to work as expected when visiting an agenda buffer with that name. But I do not seem to be able to use org-agenda-buffer-name to get Emacs to recognize an agenda buffer when org-agenda-sticky is set to t.
 Any ideas?

 I know there is the whitespace-cleanup-mode which does a okay job with the option to only do cleanup when the file was already clean, but i would like to go further and only do whitespace cleanup on the lines i have modified.
 anyone would know how to replicate this feature?

 One my of emacs windows is showing that file, however, if I update the image again the image on the buffer will only update if I select the buffer. How to make it update itself?

Now, is it possible to create something very similar using Scala 3 metaprogramming with compile-time checks? I was also looking at structural types. For instance: class Record(elems: (String, Any)*) extends Selectable: private val fields &#x3D; elems.toMap def selectDynamic(name: String): Any &#x3D; fields(name) type Person &#x3D; Record { val name: String; val age: Int } Would it be possible to define a functions that return a selected projection, similar to: Person.select(name) -&gt; Record { val name: String } PS: I&#x27;m ‏‏‎ very new to Scala 3. Trying to explore the potential of the new features for DSL constructions.

                              <span>Hey guys! I hope you&#x27;re all doing wonderful. I am looking to setup a global Redis cache and consume it from my Play Framework APIs written in Scala. I want to perform ops like:
  
Reading from Cache
 Adding to Cache (With Expiration TIme)
 Updating Cache
  
Has someone done this before? Can someone point me to good resource on implementing the same? I tried to do it with a node server and it worked like a charm but while trying to do the same with Scala Play, I am still not getting good enough resources. Can someone help me and give me tips how to approach this to be time and speed efficient?

                              <span>I hope you won&#x27;t mind this somewhat off-topic post. It is about the Haskell community, but not technical.
 I have been participating in the Haskell community since 2009. In that time I have learned a great deal from Haskellers around the world including Eastern Europe. I have the greatest wish for the safety of all Haskellers, from all parts of the world. You are all my friends, even though we have only met virtually.

                              <span>Greetings to you all from a future PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I&#x27;ve been using The Archive for about a year and a half and it has been a remarkable tool for me to organize my torrent of thoughts for a variety of projects. I especially love how I&#x27;m able to record my thoughts and surf through my notes without needing to take my fingers off the keyboard.
As I have gotten deeper into my research, I&#x27;ve found myself using LaTeX much more frequently, especially for mathematical purposes, and I&#x27;d imagine it will be necessary for other tasks as well. Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?
Have a good day everyone</span>

                              <span>Greetings to you all from a future PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I&#x27;ve been using The Archive for about a year and a half and it has been a remarkable tool for me to organize my torrent of thoughts for a variety of projects. I especially love how I&#x27;m able to record my thoughts and surf through my notes without needing to take my fingers off the keyboard.
As I have gotten deeper into my research, I&#x27;ve found myself using LaTeX much more frequently, especially for mathematical purposes, and I&#x27;d imagine it will be necessary for other tasks as well. Does The Archive support LaTeX? If not, are there some workarounds for this to be possible? What other note-taking software is out there that has bi-directional linking and LaTeX support as well?
Have a good day everyone</span>

I&#x27;m loving the &quot;.+1w&quot; style repeaters but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to quickly enter them without manually adding it to the end of the scheduled date. Is there a shortcut that I am missing?
