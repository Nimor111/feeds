                              <span>Hello,
 I have the following code example to encode numerals as Church numerals, this compiles (with RankNTypes enabled) :
 s :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; c s x y z &#x3D; x z (y z) k :: a -&gt; b -&gt; a k x _ &#x3D; x type ChurchNumeral &#x3D; forall a. (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a csucc :: ChurchNumeral -&gt; ChurchNumeral csucc n &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) n 
 However, once I η-reduce csucc to
 csucc &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) 
 I get
 • Couldn&#x27;t match type: (b0 -&gt; c0) -&gt; a0 -&gt; b0 with: forall a. (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a Expected: ChurchNumeral -&gt; ChurchNumeral Actual: ((b0 -&gt; c0) -&gt; a0 -&gt; b0) -&gt; (b0 -&gt; c0) -&gt; a0 -&gt; c0 • In the expression: s (s (k s) k) In an equation for ‘csucc’: csucc &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) | 130 | csucc &#x3D; s (s (k s) k) | 
 How could I get this version to compile? I&#x27;m guessing passing in the argument explicitly allows GHC to know that the second argument of the most-outer s call has the expected type, but leaving that s partially applied, GHC is looking for the type in the signature of s and it can&#x27;t unify that type with ChurchNumeral. Is that correct?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>-XScopedTypeVariables is super useful but traditionally only allowed binding type variables in function definitions with explicit types. Recently-ish we got explicit type variables in pattern positions
 lookupQMap :: forall a. Typeable a &#x3D;&gt; QKey a -&gt; QMap -&gt; Maybe a lookupQMap qid qmap &#x3D; -- This could use a Data.Typeable.cast, but it&#x27;s simplified from some more complex code case lookupQ qid qmap of ResultEntry @r&#x27; dat _ | Just Refl  ... 
 Which is great and makes GADTs much more usable in my experience. But there is some churn when adding new arguments, which I usually work around by using record syntax
  case lookupQ qid qmap of ResultEntry @r {resultData&#x3D;dat} -- [parser] [E] parser error on input &#x27;{&#x27; 
 The proposal and paper don&#x27;t seem to mention record patterns. Is this an oversight, or an intentional decision because it would make the grammar ambiguous, or something else? Does anyone know a workaround?

 I have only found today&#x27;s date, and I don&#x27;t know how to perform an asthmatic operation like subtracting one from the year&#x27;s parameter.
 Currently, this template expansion % expands to today&#x27;s date, how can I modify it?

                              <span>First, I am not the author of this tool, but have used toc-mode to make tables of contents for pdf and djvu files for many times. There are only a few other tools have the same functionality, but toc-mode is supposed to be the most convenient one. 
 Most other tools are command line, which is not adequate for this task. Even though a pdf contains the information of its table of contents, it is almost impossible to get a perfect table of contents automatically. You always need to do some editing to the extracted table, and this is why having this tool in Emacs is reasonable. Most editors focus on programming code, but things involving editing are more than that. I think toc-mode is a good example.
 By the way, the same author has more ambitious goals to create better a better doc viewer with some editing functionalities in Emacs. This is again a great example how Emacs do can more than code editing.

                              <span>I have been eyeing emacs for a very long time but haven&#x27;t taken the plunge yet because of the barrier to entry. I take a lot of notes that involve figures and equations. Due to my dislike for latex, I type all of my notes using markdown in vim. While markdown is fine for simple readmes, it&#x27;s a bit lacking when it comes to organizing figures or making anything but basic tables. I would like to know whether orgmode has the ability to group figures. There are two kinds of these. The first is the type where you have multiple independent figures along a row, with each having its own caption. The second is like the first but in addition to each figure having its own caption, there&#x27;s a caption for the whole group. Can emacs do that without resorting to using ugly latex code ?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to configure my shell to automatically jump to the first error, so that I can easily visit the file at the line number where the error occurred. However, I&#x27;m coming up short when looking for hooks, functions, or filters to make use of. Essentially, I want to run compilation-next-error whenever a compilation finishes with errors.
 ​
 In case you haven&#x27;t tried compilation-shell-minor-mode inside an inferior shell, please give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it. It also works with vterm, but you need to do a little extra work to make sure the key bindings don&#x27;t conflict with each other.

 Connecting to the port via browser or telnet produces JSON output if that also helps.

                              <span>Hello, guys! I have the technical question.
 Need to merge the payload if the reference number(refNo) is the same in different messages. Limitation is that I can only use a KTable and if the key is an even number I don&#x27;t need to merge the payload. Additionally, the order of incoming messages should not change the result.
 ​
 For example, if we have an empty topic and incoming messages are:
 ​
 1: { key: &quot;1&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1}} }
 2: { key: &quot;2&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: &quot;3&quot;, value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} } // this one should be not effected and left how it is
 ​
 Expected result:
 ​
 1: { key: &quot;1&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data1, data2}} }
 2: { key: &quot;2&quot;, value: {refNo:1, payload:{data2}} }
 3: { key: &quot;3&quot;, value: {refNo:2, payload:{data3}} }
 ​
 The only way I can think of to do this is to use two times .groupBy and join with the original topic everything again.
 ​
  
First change the key to refNo, save the key to the value itself, and join the payload during aggregation.
 Secondly .groupBy revert key to the initial state.
 The last step joins everything to the original topic because I lost one message during grouping by.
  
​
 I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s an easier way to do this. What is the most optimized and elegant way to solve this issue?
 ​
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>The following is mentioned in the documentation:
  
You can make looping patterns greedy using the pattern.greedy() method, but you cannot yet make group patterns greedy.
  
And in the examples they have the following comment for greedy:
 // expecting 2, 3 or 4 occurrences and repeating as many as possible start.times(2, 4).greedy()
 What do they mean by repeating as many as possible in this context?

                              <span>I recently have switched from using ivy/counsel to vertico/consult/embark/marginalia. Sometime during this transition, when I ran load-theme, it would activate each theme as I scrolled through the list, giving a preview of the theme with the current windows. When I finalized my configuration, I found that I no longer got theme previews when running load-theme. Did I imagine this functionality? Does anyone know how to set this up? I read through the docs for consult and embark and didn&#x27;t see anything relevant. Thanks!

 Here is the type of data that I am trying to plot:

 I am running emacs on WSL2 on a windows computer and I installed gnuplot from the ubuntu terminal first. Then I also included the following in my init.el file: use-package gnuplot :straight t. I then placed my cursor near the table and ran M-x org-plot/gnuplot as mentioned in the manual. I did not get any errors but I am not sure where the graph was created? How can I make the graph pop up in the org file?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to bypass org-agenda dispatcher (unsure about the terminology here: I&#x27;m talking about the buffer you get immediately upon calling org-agenda), and thought of a simple way of doing it. 
 (defun my/org-agenda () (interactive) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list &#x27;my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((view (cdr (assoc (completing-read &quot;Select an agenda view: &quot; my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view nil))) 
 That worked just fine, but I thought it&#x27;d be nice to be able to pass restrictions (to buffer, subtree, etc.) to the function, perhaps using C-u as a prefix for a buffer restriction and C-u C-u for a subtree restriction. So I figured this should work: 
 (defun my/org-agenda-restr (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (when arg (org-check-for-org-mode)) (setq my/agenda-views nil) (dolist (cmd org-agenda-custom-commands) (add-to-list &#x27;my/agenda-views (cons (car (cdr cmd)) (car cmd)))) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg &#x27;(4)) &#x27;buffer) ((equal arg &#x27;(16)) &#x27;subtree))) (view (cdr (assoc (completing-read &quot;Select an agenda view: &quot; my/agenda-views) my/agenda-views)))) (org-agenda nil view restr))) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t. For some reason, no matter which custom view I try to call, I get a CRM prompt asking me to choose a keyword. 
 Now, I thought maybe I was passing the wrong type of object as the third argument for org-agenda, So I tested using this, and it looks like what I&#x27;m passing as the third argument is a symbol, which I thought is what it wanted: 
 (defun my/test (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((restr (cond ((equal arg &#x27;(4)) &#x27;buffer) ((equal arg &#x27;(16)) &#x27;subtree)))) (when (symbolp restr) (message &quot;Yes&quot;)))) 
 So I&#x27;m going wrong somewhere, but cannot figure out where.

                              <span>I am using chemacs2 in order to test other emacs flavours and learn from them. My main emacs is a nano-emacs based on the config of u/Nicolas-Rougier.
 But while the loading of my emacs works without any problem when located under .emacs.d, if I use chemacs2 and relocate my default config under .emacs.nano, I get the error that the library guess-language is missing, when starting emacs with emacs --with-profile default. Why does this problem only come with chemacs2? I am using straight as the package manager. 
 Has anyone else also similar problems with chemacs2?

                              <span>Is there something special about the key combination C-&#x3D;? 
 I tried to bind C-&#x3D; to er/expand-region from the expand-region package but nothing happens when I press C-&#x3D;. 
 If I try C-h k C-&#x3D; it&#x27;s as if I hadn&#x27;t pressed any key at all. The minibuffer prompts me to press some keys as if I hadn&#x27;t pressed anything. 
 For example a bare text-mode buffer C-h k C-&#x3D; C-p previous-line.
 Further, if i try binding C-S-&#x3D; the same situation - it&#x27;s ignored. Yet binding C-+ works so when I press C-S-&#x3D; what is bound to C-+ executes.
 As far as I can tell my OS (linux) window manager (xfce4 xf4wm) doesn&#x27;t bind C-&#x3D; to anything special.

                              <span>For instance, I&#x27;ve been thinking of going more light-weight and porting from some long time packages I&#x27;ve been using, in favor of some more recent &quot;Emacs api&quot; based alternatives. However, it&#x27;s quite painful to try to adjust the settings drastically on my &quot;perfect&quot; system (I botch a config, all of a sudden just undoing those changes is difficult).
 I&#x27;ve been thinking of making an alternate/fake user account just for the other Emacs setup (or a chroot?) - anyone have any other ideas/preferences?

 Oh yeah fill-paragraph does not have this behavior in other modes. It is behaving as expected.

Brave individuals who we created this script for, who are not only willing to org mode it, but org mode it in the nude mobile with orgzly.
 The only way for us to continue improvement, fix bugs, optimize code, and provide additional features to benefit the use or org is to have people out in the real world using it and breaking it. So, my brave friends, use it, and break it good. Break it real good.

                              <span>Some of you Zettelkasten fans might be interested in an outdated and idiosyncratic program called Literary Machine. You can learn more here:
http://sommestad.com/lm.htm
The program is powerful but far from intuitive, so here are my personal notes about how to use it:
The core items in LM are:
Concept/category words (in the Dictionary pane).
Text items (notes; little boxes in which you write text).
Projects (collections of selected text items).
In a regular outliner program, you add items to a category (in a tree view or hierarchical list); in LM, it&#x27;s just the opposite: you add categories to an item (similar to tagging with #hashtags. This is true for LM projects, too. You don&#x27;t add items to a project; you add projects to an item. All of this is done by dragging a concept (dictionary word)…</span>

                              <span>Hi. Here is yunpeng! I am new to Zettelkasten Method and just finish reading the intro written by Sascha. It is really awesome and concrete. However, I think some parts of it are duplicate. I combine Sascha&#x27;s intro and my own understanding to write a condensed version of his/her intro. Any advice is welcomed!    
1. What

  
Zettelkasten contains many atom thoughts and this method chains each thought together by their unique addresses. This web of thoughts makes it convenient to visit from one thought to another.



Thus, this method underlines the connection between different knowledge. On the contrary, stacking notes linearly just leads to a bloated mess over time. This non-linear organization just allows our mind to scale with the number of thoughts (organic growth) and still remain cle…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at this in hackage trying to pick apart the concept of Num and I&#x27;m wondering (among other things) why there is no commutativity for multiplication mentioned? Is it somehow auto-magically created from the other &quot;ring&quot; properties? I&#x27;ve got a few more questions, but those later.

                              <span>Actually, I already tried setting it up in VSCode, I installed stack, then a bunch of haskell extensions, then VSCode told me to install GHCup, and then updated extensions and what not and now nothing works.
 Whenever I try running my program with &quot;Load GHCI&quot; I get this kind of message: 
 : error: can&#x27;t find file: Lib.hs Failed, no modules loaded. 
 And when I try executing the default &quot;someFunc&quot; function (which basically prints a string) I get: 
 :1:1: error: Variable not in scope: someFunc 
 What&#x27;s wrong? How can I fix that? Or maybe I should just start from 0? Or even use a different IDE? What do you guys recommend?
 I&#x27;m very much fascinated with Haskell, category theory and functional programming, but how can I get into it when I&#x27;m unable to execute a simple Haskell program.

 https://github.com/masterdezign/Learning#readme
 https://github.com/mikeizbicki/hlearn

 Are there any people here that can attest for the ease of use of any specific library? Perhaps some suggestions for other libraries that I haven&#x27;t found? 
 I wanna try building a music classification application to make it easier to make good d&amp;d playlists and I wanna look around for some language that I haven&#x27;t tried yet, so I can learn something new while I&#x27;m building.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am working on a Haskell project using cabal. It is a simple executable cabal project with a Main.hs file which imports a few other .hs files.
 Whenever I build it using cabal new-run, the imported source files seem to only get recompiled if something that depends on them changes in Main.hs. This is the case regardless of whether they have been edited since the last compilation.
 How can I change this behavior? Am I doing something wrong? Surely I should be able to edit the imported files and have the changes be reflected upon compiling the project?
 My workaround as of now is to systematically delete, before each compilation, all the files generated by cabal during the last one, which I am sure is not the intended way.
 Sorry if my question is dumb; as might be apparent I don&#x27;t know much about the compilation process but I&#x27;d be happy to know more.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m making a compiler for a Computer Science class for a fairly simple language based on pascal (Pascal-0).
 In this language, we have a few reserved keywords, the thing is, they are case-insensitive (as are the variables). That means that for example, function, FUNCTION and funCTiOn all mean the same thing.
 As these are reserved keywords, I can easily &quot;hard-code&quot; them into the Lexer with something like this:
 function { \_ -&gt; FUNCTION } 
 But this obviously is not case insensitive.
 I found a possible way to do it with maps, but I really would prefer to do it via regex if possible.
 Obviously, I can also do something like:
  (f|F)(u|U) ... (o|O)(n|N) 
 but that&#x27;s obviously out of the question as it is not scalable.
 Is this at all possible, and is there a better way to do it other than maps, if regex isn&#x27;t possible?

And I&#x27;ve wondered, once more, why the state of error messages in Haskell is so deplorable? Python gives you concise useful hints like &quot;perhaps you meant .. &quot; if you misspelt a variable, and on a whole makes it much easier to know what you&#x27;ve done wrong once you&#x27;ve read the message. On the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure how many people are expected to understand what the following error message is supposed to mean without some significant Googling and time spent banging your head over what a Skolem type is:
 ...
 Couldn&#x27;t match type \k0&#x27; with \b&#x27; because type variable \b&#x27; would escape its scope This (rigid, skolem) type va…</span>

Gives me the type of anything the user inserts (e.g. true --&gt; Bool; 3 --&gt; Integer)
 Then outputs false IF the type does not equal Num
  
Currently i have:
 ziffertest :: Num -&gt; Bool
 ziffertest x &#x3D; x&#x3D;0 &amp;&amp; TYPE CONDITION
 In consequence e.g. f only puts out an error and not a boolean false.

                              <span>Kinda clickbait title, but I&#x27;ll go with it. I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s familiar with both functional and oo paradigm and have experience working on industrial/research project with both. Although I work with different languages and paradigms for work and study purposes, I personally prefer Haskell over other languages I work with.
 Recently, I decided to learn a new language (for fun, for job hunt etc) and am thinking of Scala. Since I love Haskell, I wanted to start with Functional Programming in Scala. However, seems like the book doesn’t cover Scala 3. Should I worry about it and use some other resource? Or should I just go with Scala 2.x?
 Also, since I haven’t started learning, I&#x27;d appreciate if you let me know if I should learn it or something else (maybe &quot;Go for elixir since you like strictly functional stuff&quot;)?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Thank you all for your valuable comments. I made up my mind to give Scala a try. Probably I will start with 2.x and move to 3 after getting some head around it.

M-x sql-postgres prompts for user, host, password and then starts a psql session (comint). I need to instead use the URL form - postgres://host?keepalives_idle?et_al - but need help getting that sent properly. I&#x27;ve tried setting sql-connection-alist 
 (setq sql-connection-alist &#x27;(db (sql-product &#x27;postgres)(sql-database &#x27;postgres://host/dbname?keepalives_idle&#x3D;60&amp;keepalives_count&#x3D;10)))
 but still get prompted for host/user. (I have a .psqlrc file so no password needed)
 All this on linux platforms, emacs version is 25 sadly
 Any pointers appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have a completing-read type command that can perform commonly used file moving/copying operations. For example, I&#x27;m constantly syncing a couple of projects to a remote machine where they run. Currently I bind a key for each one to an rsync shell command call like so:
 (defun myprojectA-sync () (interactive) (shell-command (concat &quot;rsync -a --progress --exclude-from&#x3D;&#x27;~/myprojectA/.syncignore&#x27; ~/myprojectA/ remotemachine1:~/myprojectA/ &amp;&amp; echo &#x27;Done.&#x27;&quot;)))) (map! :leader :desc &quot;Sync my project A from local machine&quot; &quot;c b&quot; #&#x27;myprojectA-sync) 
 It&#x27;d be helpful to have one single command to call a completion list that can run the pre-defined file operations for Project A, B, C, etc. I don&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t act on multiple machines (remotemachine1, remotemachine2, etc.) or use different commands (mv, scp, rsync, etc.).
 Is there some feature/package that already exists to do something like this? 
 If not, does anyone have suggestions for a novice in elisp when it comes to writing the function? My thoughts so far were just a bunch of lists like
 (setq sync-names &#x27;(&quot;Sync project A&quot; &quot;Sync project B&quot;)) (setq sync-method &#x27;(&quot;rsync&quot; &quot;scp&quot;)) (setq sync-dest-dir &#x27;(&quot;remotemachine1:~/dir1&quot; &quot;remotemachine2:~/otherdir&quot;)) 
 to call shell-command wrapped in competing-read.

                              <span>I want to make a serious deep dive into understanding cookies (as in web cookies). I&#x27;m wondering if using Emacs as my web browser while I do this would work. I&#x27;ve not tried it at all.
 The thought is that I will be able to dig out and look at the cookies more easily and rig up triggers for various events such as when particular cookies are fetched or changed, etc.
 Along those lines, are there any Emacs packages you would recommend to help facilitate this adventure?

What is the native way to have this kind of functionality with icomplete? And for that matter, how does your fido config look like? Its hard to find examples on the internet

                              <span>is anyone using org-capture-ref ? I am planning to replace my zotero in my workflow with emacs. so far capturing content from browsers and adding more details by hand which is tedious. Zotero auto-discovers such metadata automatically adaptive to the site. org-capture-ref seems to be doing a similar thing, org-ref does this but its main UX is from emacs, but when I read i mostly live on firefox and only capture when necessary. it helps me explore more, and would the method till get used to browsing via emacs, which may take a long time, because my bad I have huge resistance. I am going to try out org-capture-ref, but would like to know the experience of existing users.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a little derived mode that makes using emacs as a MySQL client a little more developer-friendly: https://git.sr.ht/~rfm/dbcnx-mode/tree/master
 Essentially, you name SQL files according to the keys in your &#x60;sql-connection-alist&#x60;, and with a &#x60;dbcnx&#x60; extension. The mode adds one keybinding: &#x60;C-c C-l&#x60;, which connects using the credentials associated with the filename/alist key, leaving you with one buffer containing queries you want to run and another in which to run them and see the results.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve been struggling with this issue for several days now and wondered if any Mac OS Emacs users have successfully overcome it. I created a thread on the Emacs StackExchange describing the issue and my attempts at solutions in detail, but the gist is:
  
I&#x27;m building Emacs from source on Mac OS, 12.4 w/ M1.
 
I&#x27;m configuring Emacs with native compilation.
 
  ./configure --with-native-compilation \ --with-ns \ --disable-silent-rules 
  
The build succeeds, src/emacs runs like a charm and I make install.
 
My nextstep/Emacs.app runs, but emits a ton of libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver errors to the Messages buffer.
 
 I suspect the Emacs.app package has some misconfigured paths that are unable to find my libgccjit library, which I&#x27;ve installed via homebrew. I&#x27;ve tried experimenting with exec-path-from-shell to ensure Emacs is aware of my shell paths, but to no avail.
 In the meantime, I&#x27;ve been able to use emacs and emacsclient from the CLI with no issues to speak of. The only problems arise when I interact with the Emacs.app application. Anyone have an idea as to what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>When GHC 9.2 was released in late 2021, I was eager to migrate my projects, particularly to reap the ergonomic benefits
of the record dot syntax feature.
My disappointment was immeasurable as I discovered that some of my more involved type-level computations caused GHCi to
get stuck, just spinning indefinitely at full CPU load – it meant that in order to get productive with the new compiler,
I would have to invest a potentially significant amount of time to debug a regression.
Since my plate was already full at the time, I postponed this with the hope of an upcoming minor release magically fixing
the issue.
At the beginning of May, I was presented with the opportunity to work on an arbitrary GHC topic in order to gain
expertise as part of Tweag’s mission to improve GHC. To avoid having to …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m using GADTs to model the domain of my programme, and quite enjoying the experience, but have found that it requires quite a lot of boilerplate.
 For example, I am building a series of &quot;filter&quot; functions which filter input datatypes:
  data MyType &#x3D; TypeOne | TypeTwo data MyEntity (t :: MyType) where MyEntityOne :: String -&gt; MyEntity &#x27;TypeOne MyEntityTwo :: String -&gt; String -&gt; MyEntity &#x27;TypeTwo 
 I can create input filters which I can nicely compose with a fish (&gt;&#x3D;&gt;) operator:
  filterOnes :: forall a. MyEntity a -&gt; Maybe (MyEntity &#x27;TypeOne) filterOnes x@(MyEntityOne {}) &#x3D; Just x filterOnes _ &#x3D; Nothing 
 The thing is, I&#x27;m finding writing this sort of case a bit tedious, and it would be much nicer to have something like this:
  filterOnes &#x3D; filterFor @&#x27;TypeOne -- or, even better myFilter :: forall a. MyEntity a -&gt; Maybe (MyEntity &#x27;TypeOne) myFilter &#x3D; (filterFor @&#x27;TypeOne) &gt;&#x3D;&gt; someOtherFilter 
 But I don&#x27;t know how to create something like this, which reminds me of the generic-lens library. I feel like this might be a common pattern with GADTs, is there an obvious solution?

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;ve got some exciting news to share.
 Earlier this year, I&#x27;ve released the first version of HVM, a massively parallel functional runtime that aims to be the ultimate target for pure functional languages like Haskell, Elm, Kind and many others, and finally unleash the inherent parallelism of the functional paradigm. HVM&#x27;s first version was very limited; it could only parallelize algorithms that recursed in a perfect binary tree fashion, it lacked IO and had some synchronization bugs. Soon, we&#x27;ll be releasing an updated version, which fixes these bugs, includes IO primitives, and a new workstealing-based scheduler, which is capable of generalizing to basically any functional program that isn&#x27;t inherently sequential. For example, it can use all cores on the computation of Fib(n), achieving maximal performance!
 The most exciting news, though, is that a GPU runtime is on the works. I&#x27;ve just, right now, finished the very initial prototype, a self-contained, 1200-LOC file that evaluates a busy recursive function on the GPU. It is performing about 680 million rewrites/second on 4096 cores of my Laptop RTX 3080. That&#x27;s 4x more than single-thread performance, on the very first attempt of the very first prototype. I believe we&#x27;ll soon be reaching record benchmarks on GPUs. Several API improvements and stability features will also be included on the upcoming update.
 We&#x27;re ahead of very exiting times for functional programming, and I hope this encourages language developers to target the HVM! Imagine a working STG-&gt;HVM compiler? We&#x27;re also interested in hiring a CUDA professional to help us profile and improve the GPU back-end. If you know someone who&#x27;d be interested, please let me know via DM! And be welcome to visit our Discord community and ask anything on the #HVM channel.

                              <span>To add to the list of Haskell wishes I posted yesterday: instance derivation for variable size tuples.
 That each tuple size has to be treated separately is really annoying. A lot of effort has been spent on much less important (&#x3D; less common) problems, it certainly can be solved somehow with the syntax for variable type tuple size + extended tuple size... Actually maybe I&#x27;m just reinventing some existing wheel, but I&#x27;ve never seen it used.
 For example:
 class Encoding a where encode :: a -&gt; String 
 Now I have to do:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) &#x3D; encode a  encode b instance Encoding (a, b, c) where encode (a, b, c) &#x3D; encode a  encode b  encode c -- and so on until the limit of either tuple size or patience is reached 
 You can see code like this across endless number of libraries, including base
 Why cannot I instead have something like this:
 instance Encoding (a, b) where encode (a, b) &#x3D; encode a  encode b instance Encoding (..., b) where encode (a@..., b) &#x3D; encode a  encode b 
 Never mind the specific syntax, it can be whatever, but the idea is to define instance for all tuple sizes recursively.
 Is it maybe possible already?
 That would also require (and allow) some size-polymorphic operations to add/split the first/last tuple elements, in a type safe way.
 I&#x27;ve no idea why it doesn&#x27;t already exist.

 This was an especially noticeable deficiency when trying selectrum with projectile-find-file - I couldn&#x27;t open my dotfiles and type &quot;init&quot; to find &quot;init.el&quot;, as it seemed to want me to specify the entire path preceding it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using emacs to write tex documents for a long time, and recently switched to spacemacs, with evil mode. I use the reftex command reftex-reference to insert \ref commands. In spacemacs evil mode, when I use this, the reference is inserted *before* the cursor (point), so that it&#x27;s off by one character. I would like to know if it&#x27;s possible to configure this to insert after. I&#x27;m asking here because I think this is a general evil-mode issue rather than a specific spacemacs configuration issue. Details below.
 Here&#x27;s what happens:
 Have a tex file with some text like the following, with the cursor at the rectangle marker, and with the buffer in evil&#x27;s &quot;normal state&quot; (like vim&#x27;s normal mode), not insert mode.
 \begin{theorem}\label{mylabel} theorem text \end{theorem} Now some words▮ 
 Note that this is what happens when there&#x27;s a space *after* &quot;words&quot; in the text; in evil&#x27;s normal state, the cursor is a block that occupies the position of a character.
 Then I use the reftex-reference command and select &quot;mylabel&quot;. The inserted text I get is
 Now some words\ref{mylabel}▮ 
 with the inserted \ref *before* the trailing space. Then the space appears *after*. I believe the line that actually does the inserting is line 510 of reftex-ref.el.
 ​
 To be clear, this is not because the final character is a space. If I delete the space after &quot;words&quot;, positioning my cursor on the final &quot;s&quot;, then the inserted reference looks like
 Now some word\ref{mylabel}s 
 with the cursor positioned on the final &quot;s&quot;.
 ​
 So, the problem seems to be that reftex-reference is doing the insertion on the *left* side of the &quot;normal state&quot; cursor, not the right. I would like it to insert on the right. Does anyone here know how this can be configured?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I guess this is a rhetorical question because I doubt anyone knows why but it turns out that dired buffers return nil for buffer-file-name instead of the path to the directory they are viewing.
 I believe this has cost me a ton of time but I did learn a lot along the way. lsp-docker highest level function is lsp-docker-start. It calls lsp-workspace-root which calls buffer-file-name which, if starting from a dired buffer, returns nil so lsp-workspace-root returns nil and the LSP server is not started.
 This is my first venture into LSP mode and I was doing something slightly different, a basic low level function was returning nil, so I assumed I was way off track in my set up, and I needed to dig deeper. And, indeed, I came up with a solution. I was documenting what I had found for myself so I wouldn&#x27;t forget and started asking myself more questions.
 I went back and tested lsp-workspace-root in a file that had LSP mode enabled and it returned the proper path for the workspace. I then restarted everything, loaded lsp-mode but didn&#x27;t start it, and went to the directory of the project. Sure enough, lsp-workspace-root returned nil (as it had before). I then looked at the code and started to try and follow it step by step. That&#x27;s when I discovered that dired buffers have no buffer-file-name. I opened TAGS (an arbitrary file within the project) and now lsp-workspace-root returns the proper workspace.
 I think I could have set up my LSP stuff with a simple YAML file had I tried lsp-docker-start from a file rather than a dired buffer and saved the time spent coming up with the solution I pointed to.
 Anyhow... live and learn I guess.

 the above snippet is in my config to conveniently choose from a pool of recently visited files. I am wondering if there is any advantage in using &quot;change buffer&quot; e.g. ibuffer instead? Or rather, whats the difference ?

 I&#x27;ve had a look through the manual and can&#x27;t find anything. Maybe I&#x27;m just being dense, or maybe the docs haven&#x27;t been updated, but surely this exists right?

                              <span>hi guys, to reduce amount of topics I create here I wish I can use emacs&#x27; self-documentation better. 
 I can&#x27;t quite figure how to search across all the documentation for a specific word or regex if possible. 
 Example: I know that org-clock-report table (or clocktable) has :narrow param. I initially found it in google but now, since I know it exists, how can I quickly find info about this param directly in emacs? For example I want to find a manual page where this param is mentioned. Is there anything like apropos-EVERYTHING command that will look for a word (or regex) in all documentation? 
 Even more. I now know that info about :narrow param for clock table can be found in org manual on a page called The clock table. I know it from google. How could I find this page using emacs? 
 How would you find that page in emacs manual?
 P.S. I know about describe-* and apropos-* (and info) functions but I don&#x27;t see any function that does the search across everything. There are also similar questions in the internet and there is a suggestion to search the documentation with grep or zgrep which I don&#x27;t find useful. They just search in *.info files which when opened don&#x27;t behave as info pages. Is greping the only way?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen developers expensing a Sublime Text / JetBrains license to their employer, no questions asked. It would be amazing if one could similarly contribute financially towards emacs development efforts. 
 Would it be possible to cook up something formal enough (through FSF or some other org) like an annual &quot;Emacs support license&quot; with a couple of different tiers based on amounts (such that users can choose the split to different projects of interest). Users might then be able to expense it at work with the justification that it helps improve the specific packages they depend on (including core emacs). The same &quot;licenses&quot; could equally well serve as a portal for personal donations, but I feel that there&#x27;s likely substantial low-hanging fruit in getting corporate funding in this grassroots manner.
 (I&#x27;ve pondered about this before, but some questions on the emacs survey reminded me of this again.)

                              <span>Dear all,
 I try to use org-ref and ivy-bibtex for my bibliography management. What I&#x27;m not able to do, is to search through my bibtex file and then, decide whether to open the org-ref note, pdf, ...
 So far, what I&#x27;m able to do is:
  
run ivy-bibtex from everywhere, and search through my bibliography
 Left mouse click on an existing citation to a bib entry in my org-file to bring up org-ref-hydra/body
  
What I want to do:
  
run ivy-bibtex from everywhere, and search through my bibliography
 on return, execute org-ref-hydra/body on the selected line in ivy-bibtex
  
​
 Has someone an idea on how to achieve this behavior?
 Best

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently switching my package management from Debian to Guix, and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful. However, I just found something very curious. In the screenshot, you can see my &#x27;old&#x27; self compiled Emacs (28.1) and my new Emacs (28.2) installed via Guix. They render the same text in the same file, in the same theme, with the same font (as per M-x describe-font), but they look quite different.
 Here&#x27;s a screenshot showing the two side by side: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-a7bdddc0.png
 The version to the left is quite thin, the weight seems off. However, the weight is the same. Changing the weight will not remove this discrepancy. 
 Both Debian and Guix have the bold variant of Fira installed: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-36be0060.png
 Generally speaking, the bold variant works insofar that I can use it globally: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-5620acc4.png
 However, when used in a font-face, it won&#x27;t become bold: https://screenshots.200ok.ch/screenshot_2022_10_26-bb7ddfd5.png
 I&#x27;m happy if anyone can point me to the necessary change to make the new install look the same as before. Thank you for your help!

                              <span>​
 Hi everyone, 
 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to write an elisp function that allows me to more easily query org-roam database with various keywords.
 ​
 Suppose I want to find all the titles that contain both &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;, I know this can be done with a single query instance like the following:
 ​
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title &quot;%hello%&quot;)
 (like title &quot;%world%&quot;)) ] )
 ​
 Now I&#x27;m trying to turn this into an elisp function to make it easier to use. However, the challenge is my queries can contain an arbitrary number of keywords, for example:
 (org-roam-db-query [:select * :from titles
 :where (and (like title &quot;%hello%&quot;)
 (like title &quot;%world%&quot;) 
 (like title &quot;%again%&quot;)) ] )
 ​
 The function should thus accept a list of keywords and return the notes that contains ALL the keywords in that list, something like:
 ​
 my-func(&#x27;(&quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot;)) -&gt; should return all notes containing &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot;
 my-func(&#x27;(&quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;again&quot;)) -&gt; should return all notes containing &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;again&quot;
 ​
 Can anyone suggest how to implement such a function?

 It&#x27;s default &quot;markdown-toggle-markup-hiding&quot; function very trivially.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am wondering whether someone has used org-mode as a basis for publishing documentation of Python projects via Sphinx. Actually, I am looking for a workflow to write my documentation in org-mode, convert it to .md or .rst, add Sphinx&#x27; autodoc-extension and finally publish the result with GitHub Pages. 
 Has somebody done something like that? Thanks...

                              <span>Hi everyone, newbie here
 I am watching Rainer König&#x27;s video on scheduling, deadlines and agenda view. I cannot use the agenda view. One of the comments says:
 Quick tips, the keybinding for agenda view has to be setted on the init file. Standard recommendation seems to be :
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-cl&quot; &#x27;org-store-link)
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-ca&quot; &#x27;org-agenda)
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-cc&quot; &#x27;org-capture)
 (global-set-key &quot;\C-cb&quot; &#x27;org-iswitchb)
 Another one, for the agenda view to process your current file add it witc
 C-c [ 
 But I don&#x27;t have any idea what they&#x27;re talking about :/ Could you help me?

 3rd year CS student here.
 Just started learning Haskell and I absolutely love the elegance of it.
 I&#x27;m still very much a newbie but I can see this becoming my favorite language.
 I think you understand where I&#x27;m coming from. :)
 ________________________________________________________________________________
 Well anyway enough about me and on to my problem:
 - I&#x27;m using a Linux Debian based distro
 - I used ghcup to install:
 GHCup 0.1.18.0 latest, recommended Stacks 2.9.1 latest, recommended HLS 1.8.0.0 latest, recommended GHC 9.2.4 recommended GHC 9.0.2 
 ghcup, stacks and ghc all work...
 HLS works if I type haskell-language-server-wrapper-1.8.0.0 in the terminal and it says:

 Since I started working with Haskell professionally at the beginning of the year (yay!), and neovim is my editor of choice, I&#x27;ve decided to put some elbow grease into improving my experience.
 And of course I would be happy to share it with (and get feedback/contributions/ideas from) any other Haskellers who use neovim!
 haskell-tools.nvim
  
Built around haskell-language-server, mostly.
 I just finished work on a feature that triggers a hoogle search for the type signature of whatever is under the cursor.
  
On a side note, my neotest-haskell adapter (TreeSitter-powered hspec tests) now supports both Cabal and Stack.

                              <span>Hoping someone proficient in Haskell can give me some pointers on a homework assignment I&#x27;m currently bashing my head against. We&#x27;re currently covering higher order functions, and our professor wants us to write a function that acts as a form of simple memory storage. Here&#x27;s the part of the assignment that&#x27;s stumping me:
 -- We&#x27;ll consider a different way to represent memory. Memoryf is a function from variable names to values. type Memoryf &#x3D; String -&gt; Int -- The function memf1 gives all variables the value of zero memf1 &#x3D; \_ -&gt; 0 -- The following commands use the function putValue to modify our memory function: memf2 &#x3D; putValuef &quot;z&quot; 3 memf1 memf3 &#x3D; putValuef &quot;y&quot; (-2) memf2 memf4 &#x3D; putValuef &quot;x&quot; 1 memf3 -- putValue should take three arguments: -- 1. The name of a variable, x -- 2. The variable value m -- 3. A Memoryf function -- putValue should assign x to m and return the updated Memoryf function putValue :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Memoryf -&gt; Memoryf putValue x m memf &#x3D; _________________________ -- Write your code here -- Example output: -- (putValue &quot;x&quot; 5 memf4) &quot;x&quot; -- 5 
 My thinking is that calling putValue should add something to the effect of &quot;if memf x is called, return m&quot; but I have no idea how to write this. The furthest I&#x27;ve gotten is:
 putValue :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Memoryf -&gt; Memoryf putValue x m memf &#x3D; (\x -&gt; m) 
 which is useless because it will return the value of m for any variable, and thus doesn&#x27;t work as a store of value.
 I&#x27;d greatly appreciate any guidance y&#x27;all have to offer. I&#x27;m giving myself a headache trying to sort through this myself.

                              <span>I am trying to write a Functor function that returns true if the first functor law holds for a functor value. It should have the type: (Eq (f a), Functor f) &#x3D;&gt; f a -&gt; Bool 
 How can I write and test such a function?

                              <span>Just trying to get my head round do notation, and settled on a few problems with lists. I ended up writing the following code to (eventually) annotate entries in a 2d nested list (trying to mimic a 9x9 array) with column/row numbers. :
 arrayWithCoords :: [[Int]] -&gt; [[(Int, (Int, Int)]] arrayWithCoords arr &#x3D; do a &lt;- zip arr ([1..9]::[Int]) b &lt;- zip a ([1..9]::[Int]) return _ 
 Obviously the solution right now is incomplete, but I keep getting the following type error for a:
  • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type: [a0] with actual type: ([Int], Int) • In the first argument of ‘zip’, namely ‘a’ In a stmt of a &#x27;do&#x27; block: b &lt;- zip a ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) In the expression: do a &lt;- zip arr ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) b &lt;- zip a ([1 .. 9] :: [Int]) return _ 
 On inspection in the editor a is given a type annotation of [Any] , rather than ([Int], Int) as I expected

                              <span>I moved to project.el a while back. but want to make sure i&#x27;m not missing out anything that projectile users find invaluable. 
 Unsurprisingly perhaps, this thought was spurred on by the latest projectile release.
 I most likely won&#x27;t move back to projectile with this information, but may implement any very compelling features atop project.el.

                              <span>This seems awfully simple but I can&#x27;t find how to do this. I just want to bind S-C- to completely clear isearch without exiting the &quot;prompt&quot; (yes I know it&#x27;s just the echo area).
 Is there any way to do this?

                              <span>Made the foolish mistake of early adoption of MacOS Ventura. Looks to me like the new OS breaks libgccjit and therefore native comp.
 ​
 Is anyone able to compile on the latest MacOS?
 ​
 So far, I&#x27;ve been unable to link the libgccjit hello world: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/intro/tutorial01.html
 The farthest I can get is to the following errors:
 gcc-11: warning: could not understand version &#x27;13.00.00&#x27;
 ld: -rpath can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later
 collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 At which point, it seems as if the problems are inherent to gcc-11 in combination with MacOS&#x27;s ld. Anyone able to make this work?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve something strange going on since I made a basic Emacs set up in my PC (Mx-linux) but I can&#x27;t seem to get it right on my Laptop (ZorinOs) 
 Here is my init.el
 For the record both machines have .emacs.d in home directory (~/.emacs.d/init.el) and as far as I checked, neither do I have any other .emacs dir in my laptor nor any duplicate init.el
 2 Issued I have 1) init.el is not loaded unless I manually Mx load-file Load file: ~/.emacs.d/init.el 2) When I do load manually, relative line numbers and disabling the welcome screen do not work when all the rest (multi-cursor/auto-complete etc.) work normally
 And again, I&#x27;ve this issue only on my Laptop, when on my PC I get the setup fairly quickly and easily

                              <span>Yesterday I was trying lsp-mode. After getting a bit annoyed with my laptop&#x27;s fan always getting activated, I decided to try eglot. So far it feels much more lightweight.
 I&#x27;m having trouble getting it to do some things though.
 For context, I use pyvenv to manage my virtual environments:
 (use-package pyvenv:ensure t:config(pyvenv-mode 1)(pyvenv-activate &quot;~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/&quot;))
 I have done both conda install python-lsp-server[all] -c conda-forge and conda install pyright in this environment.
 If I use pyright-langserver, then a lot of imports are &quot;unknown&quot;.
 If I use pylsp, then those imports seem to work, but I get some funny autocompletion behaviour. 
 import numpy as np
 np.lin
 This says &quot;no completion found&quot;. But
 from numpy import linalg
 linalg.
 This works as expected, and I get reasonable suggestions for completions.
 ​
 Can someone tell me what&#x27;s going on here and I to get this working? I was hoping things would work right out of the box, but...

 A script that creates a repository with such a conflict:

                              <span>hi everyone, 
 I recently switched to straight.el mostly for packages contributing purposes and it works really great. 
 In my init.el I sometimes use package-installed-p function to check if package is installed but straight.el doesn&#x27;t install packages &quot;emacs way&quot; so that function always return nil. I expect there should be similar function in straight.el but I can&#x27;t find one. 
 Do you know if it&#x27;s exists? 
 Thanks
 EDIT: There is straight--installed-p but it expects a RECIPE and I don&#x27;t really understand what is this. Definitely not a package name

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always ran into this issue for years...
 My usual workflow is that I&#x27;m working on a project (with .projectile in the root directory), and at some point I need to working on files outside of this project.
 I&#x27;ll then C-x 5 2 to create a new frame and start opening files there. Then I switch buffers, and what I see are all my buffers.
 Is there a way in which I could group/filter buffers based on some default criteria? For example, if the buffer belongs to a project (with a .projectile file), filter those buffers into one group. 
 Or better yet, simply add filters so that I can stay organized.

It updates the schedule time and properties, but also adds that last line - State &quot;DONE&quot;... which I don&#x27;t want to have. Is there a way to prevent this?

 example.
 &quot;abcde*fg*hi&quot;
 I think i could set with org-emphasis-regexp-components for this. but i failed :(
 I not familiar with emacs style regexp.
 Anyone have a solution?

                              <span>I use doom emacs and it offers [ ], [-] and [X] as part of the org-todo-keywords.
 In the org-agenda I noticed that the state changes for these states are not listed with the corresponding time when org-agenda-log-mode is active.
 Here is an example to display what it looks like instead:
 Tuesday 25 October 2022 inbox: 10:00 ┄┄┄┄┄ State: (DONE) DONE Test1 TODO -&gt; DONE inbox: State: ([X]) [X] Test2 [ ] -&gt; [X] 
 The headline with Test2 is displayed without the time. Both headlines have a LOGBOOK drawer that does look the same.
 * DONE Test1 TODO -&gt; DONE :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;DONE&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END * [X] Test2 [ ] -&gt; [X] :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;[X]&quot; from &quot;[ ]&quot; [2022-10-25 Tue 10:00] :END 
 Further it seems like all todo keywords that start with [ and end with ] are not displayed with the corresponding time but below the time-grid with State: in front like seen above.
 I believe I tracked down the function that generates the State: entries (https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/9bfe00dda6b59d9b93eb7a825f6e0868afa1cca3/lisp/org/org-agenda.el#L5943) but I am not really able to understand the function and what is causing this behavior as I am fairly new to emacs/elisp
 Is there someway to show the tasks with the checkbox style todo keywords with time?
 Is this a bug or a feature that I can configure?

                              <span>During my internship at Tweag, I got the opportunity to work on Chainsail (see the announcement blog post), a web service that helps to sample from multimodal probability distributions.
A common approach to sampling well-behaved distributions involves Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from the
basic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; building a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution.
The major benefit of Metropolis-Hastings over more “direct” sampling methods is that it doesn’t require the target distribution to be normalized.
But it does have a big flaw:
if the distribution presents multiple modes separated by areas of low probability, the Markov chain tends to get stuck in one mode, and thus samples the distribution incorrectly.

 void myVeryLongFunctionNameWithoutAnyPurpose(int a);
 ​
 what is the most efficient, built-in way to navigate to e.g. the Name subword?
 using subword mode still makes me press M-f multiple times and also slows down general buffer navigation by treating every capital letter now as a separate word.

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve recently been trying to set up emacs to play nicely with python. The number of options is a bit overwhelming, but a lot of signs are pointing towards using lsp with pyright and lsp-ui. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing, along with using pyvenv to choose my virtual environments. But I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t get any warnings if my lines are too long. I&#x27;m not sure why this is? Does it have to do with my settings, or is this not something lsp/pyright should catch?

                              <span>A year or two ago, straight.el was probably the most recommended package manager for GNU Emacs. As I’ve revisited my configuration today, I noticed that there are a few recent package managers (namely, leaf and elpaca) which are new to - at least - me and (at least elpaca) want to be straight.el’s “successor”.
 Is there any write-up about the state of GNU Emacs package management in 2022? Straight.el works for me (and I need its custom build features for two packages), but I don’t want to rely on deprecated packages for too long.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with Django, using Flycheck and Company-mode for check and autocompletion. Well, Flycheck have been showing errors with objects member in classes, but this is a False positive, even company sugest to me the correct completion but Flycheck mark this like error.
 I have searched in web, and found that Flycheck is using wrong dir, but i don&#x27;t know how customize that. Is there some option to Flycheck work well on Django?
 pylint has an module named pylint-django. Can be this enhabled in Flycheck?
 Edit: I found solution that works to me for now, but isn&#x27;t automatic.
 1) Install pylint-django pluging with pip pip install pylint-django
 2) Create a pylint config file in the root directory of project. You can do thi from terminal
 pylint --generate-rcfile &gt; .pylintrc
 3)Enhable Django pluging in pylint config file in &quot;load-plugins&quot; line
 load-plugins&#x3D;pylint_django
 That worked to me. When you start flychek in current buffer, you can see if flycheck is using the config file:
 M-x flycheck-verify-setup

 About the Survey
 This time there are no non-free Javascript or user-tracking caveats as this features a bespoke survey framework written from scratch for the Emacs User Survey to support a pure HTML-forms + CSS approach with server-side rendering 🎉.
 See the FAQ for more information on the survey itself.
 Promoting the survey
 It would be fantastic for this to be shared as far and wide as possible, to get responses from a large swathe of the community. If you can share this with the non-Reddit Emacs communities you are a part of, as well as any friends or colleagues that use Emacs that would be greatly appreciated 😊.
 So far the Survey has been shared on: - Reddit - Hacker News - Lobste.rs
 Addendum: all my responses are shown as missing?
 It has been noticed by several people that their results page shows some or all of their answers to be missing for questions they answered. In every case I&#x27;ve checked so far, all responses did get recorded in the database, but there seems to be a glitch that is occurring in some cases with the display/export of results.
 TLDR; Do not worry, your answers are safe.

                              <span>Since its initial release (corresponding thread) the library has got several improvements (the current version is 2.2.0.0), but the most significant development happened within the ecosystem. Here&#x27;s the list of new adapter libraries:
  
crypto-rng-effectful - generation of cryptographically secure random bytes and numbers.
 
log-effectful - structured logging with multiple backends.
 
hpqtypes-effectful - access to a PostgreSQL database.
 
retry-effectful - combinators for monadic actions that may fail.
 
 It&#x27;s worth noting that all of these are light wrappers over existing libraries, not rewrites. As advertised, effectful makes it easy to adapt libraries to be used as effects.
 Also, the Monocle project has moved to effectful.
 If anyone was skeptical about effectful, maybe that&#x27;ll convince you to give it another look. I&#x27;m sure this is just the beginning :)

                              <span>According to this: https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/10/20/language-rankings-6-22/
 ​
 What is surprising is that it is:
 - more adopted than Clojure that I thought to be the most popular functional language (even though I think it&#x27;s really bad).
 - much more adopted than Erlang and F#, I thought Haskell is used less frequently than these.
 - has almost as many projects as Elixir in GitHub, but much more popular on Stack Overflow - shows the strength of the community.
 - as widely adopted as Perl.
 ​
 Looking at this chart I think we can get Haskell into the top 10 (or even 5) languages by solving several problems, as community (I do have a vested interest that it happens – our SimpleX Chat is written in Haskell):
 - make JSON a first class citizen in Haskell code, ideally with some syntax-level support, without requiring QQ, rather than one of the most complex to use libraries. It doesn&#x27;t seem a coincidence that 2 most popular languages - JavaScript and Python - make it really easy to integrate with JSON.
 - make cross-platform compilation &quot;manageable&quot; (including mobile and web), not just &quot;possible&quot;.
 - solve problem of compiled binary size - it should be at least 5x, better 10x smaller – even if it comes at cost of 10x longer compilation time (so that we would only use it for production builds).
 - at the same time, make interpreted tests execution simpler - I still can&#x27;t figure out how to do it, waiting for several minutes until it builds with most cores idling is very time consuming... Maybe this is a solved problem, and there is a simple answer how to do it.
 - make networking and cryptography more trustworthy - with exodus of some maintainers into Rust-land they are at risk of abandonment – I will share more comments on this subject a bit later.
 ​
 These are all issues that Haskell Foundation and community can help solving, we could chip in some time/money too if there is some concerted effort.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for suggestions for how to manage repeated tasks with subtasks. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to be able to mark the parent heading as done and have all the DONE subtasks (or even better, those without a certain property) be changed to TODO. In practice, what I want is to be able to move from this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED:  ** DONE Make list of dishes ** DONE Make grocery list ** DONE Get groceries 
 to this: 
 * TODO Meal plan for the week SCHEDULED:  ** TODO Make list of dishes ** TODO Make grocery list ** TODO Get groceries 
 after marking the heading task as done. 
 I suspect I could make use of org-todo-repeat-hook and define a function that will take all the sub-tasks of a given task and change them from e.g. DONE to TODO, or to the TODO state the parent will be in after repeat, e.g. 
 (defun my/org--bequeath-state () (let ((state (org-get-todo-state))) (org-map-entries (lambda () (org-todo state)) nil &#x27;tree))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-todo-repeat-hook &#x27;my/org--bequeath-state) 
 But I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has given this more thought and has a better conceived solution they&#x27;d be willing to share.

                              <span>I would like some advice for a university project that requires writing an application that makes queries on a large dataset.
 I am using Spark+Scala.
 1) materials where can i find similar solutions? where can i find some tutorials for aggregate queries in Spark? or just some examples of aggregate queries on simple datasets?
 2) Spark advices any general advice? any advice on how to best use dataframes with Spark in this project? are there general things to be careful of in order not to have bad performances?
 how would it be better to return the results of a query considering that I will have to create a graphical interface?
 3) query tips I use a flight dataset. What might be some interesting aggregate queries to do? I have a lot of columns, so a lot of information about each flight
 I know that is a lot of questions, but answers for just one question will also be helpful.

                              <span>Hi, i’m an F# senior developer with 3 years of experience in f# and 4 in c#. Because of the broader job market, and me falling in love with Scala (because e.g. HKT), i’m considering to make a career switch. 
 Has anyone went through this? How hard is it to apply for a senior position with no commercial experience in Scala?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I am currently using Org mode to try and write a JET SOP/ write fantasy books or whatever. However, When trying to navigate through the text instead of going through each line, it jumps through each paragraph in chunks. 
 I know that this is due to &quot;word wrap&quot; and that technically it is all one giant line. But how does one change this behavior. I know a few days ago when I tested Visual Studio code I got the same issue. 
 (ignore my bad writing, this is super duper early) 
 TL:DR: how to change function of emacs to make it act more like a traditional word processor?

                              <span>Before I was defaulting to always using &#x60;switch-to-buffer&#x60; and selecting things manually and thought it was just fine to do that.
 Then I started using &#x60;next-buffer&#x60; and &#x60;previous-buffer&#x60; and developing an intuition for what buffer would show up.
 It&#x27;s made my experience of using emacs drastically better in the same way that learning &#x60;ctrl+tab&#x60; and &#x60;ctrl+shift+tab&#x60; in web browsers made my browsing experience better. Maybe these kinds of feelings are very subjective, but I feel like this one might generalize to others experiences well.
 By default they are bound to &#x60;C-x &#x60; and &#x60;C-x &#x60;.
 Feel free to also share any similar other &quot;wow this makes buffer management so much nicer feeling to use&quot; experiences you&#x27;ve had.

                              <span>TL;DR
 The :file link created by org-attach when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil should be to the attachment, not to the original. In fact the link is to the original, not to the attachment. I believe this is a bug.
 DETAILS
 I&#x27;ve noticed some unexpected behavior in terms of the link that org-attach creates and places in org-stored-links when org-attach-store-link-p is non-nil. I&#x27;m seeing it when the method of attachment is move, copy, or symlink, either via org-attach-method, or when chosen directly when running C-c C-a. (I haven&#x27;t tested any of the others.) The issue concerns the target of the created link.
 My expectation is that the target of such a link should point to the actual attachment itself. By that I mean, the target should be the path to the file or link in its place in th…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tinkering with making simple interfaces with transient and tabulated-list-mode, things like a list of scripts with some information on them as columns, and key bindings/transients to edit, lint or execute them. While this is nice, for something more elaborate tabulated-list-mode is not enough. I am trying to get a view inspired by magit&#x27;s status buffer, so I thought I could use magit-section for this. However, I couldn&#x27;t find any guides on how to make something with it, and I am not savy enough to extract the exact usage from the magit code (I did try).
 So my question is, does anyone have any guides or any simple elisp code that I can use for reference to create a new derived mode out of magit-section?
 Edit: Fixed formatting.

 When I try to export an org file to pdf it always gives the error: Stopping because of bad filename. 
 Latexmk: Filename &#x27;~/notes/exports/20220825222250-beamer_presentation_example.tex&#x27; contains character not allowed for TeX file. Latexmk: Stopping because of bad filename(s). 
 I believe it is because the home directory is specified with a tilde character. 
 How can I fix this error?

                              <span>First, let me say, I accept that this isn&#x27;t strictly speaking an Emacs question, but a quick search on Reddit suggests that there isn&#x27;t a better place to ask. And I am using it with Emacs so I&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ll take a generous view.
 I download mail with mbsync, manage it with mu4e, and send it with SMTP. This all works fine and has for years.
 Except that I find that I suddenly have to deal with email hosted on office365. It does IMAP, so I can read my mail, but it warns
 &#x60;Notice: far side store does not support flag(s) &#x27;P&#x27;; not propagating.&#x60;
 The consequence of this is that the changes I make locally aren&#x27;t reflected on the server. Refiling or deleting mail doesn&#x27;t have any effect. That means my INBOX is just going to grow and grow and grow and eventually that&#x27;s going to be a problem. (Nevermind that if I decide to peek at my mail from my phone or something, it&#x27;s going to be a confusing mess.)
 In a previous life, I managed with davmail, but dear $DEITY in heaven, I&#x27;d really rather not have to do that again.
 Anyone know if mbsync (or the office365 account) can be configured to make things Work Right(TM)?

 I personally enjoy configuring things and feeling like I&#x27;m building new skills, so the startup costs I sometimes run into when creating a new development environment often don&#x27;t phase me -- I will usually spend the extra time to tinker with my dot files and learn a bit of Elisp in order to save time down the line. 
 From the start, the appeal to me has been finding ways to use my mouse less and edit code faster. I love the feeling of using my keyboard to navigate within and between files, and I think that removing the mental context switch…</span>

 I&#x27;ve recently moved my calendar need to org-mode with org-caldav after using Emacs for years for programming, writing and chatting.
 Now I wonder how/if I should do the same for Email..
 My current setup involves Kontact for IMAP and EWS.
 All the setups I&#x27;ve seen so far do download/sync all Emails from the IMAP server. Is it possible only download the headers and then the full emails on demand? My current setup is that I keep my Emails on the IMAP server and fetch only what I want to read.
 Akonadi does this quite good.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m very new to org-mode although it already looks like something that I&#x27;ve been trying to invent myself (in much more lame ways) for many years.
 One thing that I don&#x27;t immediately see from them the manual - is there some &quot;standard&quot; or well-know way to work with the outline-organized data that have multiple dimensions?
 Here is what I mean by that:
 Say, I have a lab diary where I track number of processes - each process every day:
 * Day 1 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team my notes on it ** Ongoing Experiment 1 checking out the night results, trying new approaches ** Something else ... * Day 2 ** Morning sync up meeting with the team ... ** Ongoing Experiment 1 ... ** Something else ... * Day 3 ... 
 And this is how it goes!
 So, the first dimension here is the timeline: Day 1, Day 2, ... while the second one is the processes that repeat every day.
 Clearly, depending on task, it would be handy to see this outline from the different points of view: sometimes considering the &quot;time&quot; dimension to be the outer one, sometimes to see the &quot;process&quot; dimension to be the outer:
 Time dimension is outer:
 * Day 1 ** Process 1 ** Process 2 ... * Day 2 ... 
 Process dimension is outer:
 * Process 1 ** Day 1 ** Day 2 ... * Process 2 ... 
 One can easily come up with a case of three or for dimensions like. E.g. &quot;Date/[Home|Work]/Habit/Successes&quot;.
 Turning the tree inside out to follow the day by day progress for one of experiments would be very helpful. As well as tracking the daily successes in the second example.
 Is there a built-in feature or packages or a known workflow for such case?
 Like best practice(s) for such data organization, turning the outline inside out, making different OLAP-like views into the outline?
 thanks :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to scala and a bit overwhelmed by the different repls, versions, alternative syntax etc. I really like the indentation based syntax, and the ammonite website says it supports scala 3. However, when I try to execute a script it complains.
 Is there a setting I need to turn on? Or is it simply the case that amm doesn&#x27;t support indentation based syntax?

                              <span>I want to stream values from more than 1 conduit at once, without restrictions such as &quot;the values of the conduits must have the same type&quot; or &quot;the values must be requested in a predictable order&quot;. For example, something like:
 example &#x3D; do foo  lift $ putStrLn &quot;it&#x27;s over&quot; Just True -&gt; awaitInt &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \x -&gt; (yield $ x + 4) &gt;&gt; example Just False -&gt; awaitString &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \x -&gt; (lift $ putStrLn x) &gt;&gt; (yield $ length x) &gt;&gt; example 
 How would I go about doing something like this? Can I convert a &quot;source&quot; conduit to an imperative-style generator within its respective monad? Is there some library which provides multi-input-stream conduits?

 Do I have any alternatives in the approach to doing this? I&#x27;m still new to haskell so it&#x27;s all a lot to take in.

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating a game where several &quot;walkers&quot; (and other objects) are positioned on a board. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data Dir &#x3D; N | E | S | W deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Enum, Bounded)
 data Pos &#x3D; Pos { x :: Int, y :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
 data Object &#x3D; Object { pos :: Pos, dir :: Dir} deriving (Eq, Ord)
 -- An Walker is an object with a position and a direction. newtype Walker &#x3D; Walker Object newtype Exit &#x3D; Exit Object newtype Entry &#x3D; Entry Object &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In order to move them, I have a function that takes a list of walkers all located on the same tile. Several walkers can be on the same tile, in which case they collide.
  -- this function takes a list of walkers with the same position. move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws &#x3D; ... 
 I&#x27;m not so satisfied with this solution, because the pre-condition (all located at the same position) is not reflected. I&#x27;m thinking of several solutions to express/enforce the condition: 1. Use a guard 2. Decompose the first argument 3. Use refined types
 Use a guard
 I could use a guard to enforce my pre-condition:  move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws &#x3D; ... move _ &#x3D; error &quot;All walkers must have the same position&quot; 
 It&#x27;s an OK solution, however it&#x27;s a pity that the types don&#x27;t help us and look clumsy.
 Decompose the first argument
 I could decompose the first argument to express the fact that they all have the same position:  move :: Pos -&gt; [Dir] -&gt; [Walker] move pos dirs &#x3D; ... 
 It&#x27;s an interesting solution because now illegal states are unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that my inputs are walkers and not anything else.
 Use refined types
 I couldn&#x27;t install Liquid Haskell, but I guess the solution would look like:  {-@ move :: SamePosList Walker -&gt; [Walker] @-} move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws &#x3D; ... 
 It seems overkill :)
 What is your opinion? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating a sort of game where several &quot;walkers&quot; are positioned on a board. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data Dir &#x3D; N | E | S | W deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Enum, Bounded)
 data Pos &#x3D; Pos { x :: Int, y :: Int} deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
 data Object &#x3D; Object { pos :: Pos, dir :: Dir} deriving (Eq, Ord)
 -- An Walker is an object with a position and a direction. type Walker &#x3D; Object type Exit &#x3D; Object type Entry &#x3D; Object &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Several walkers can be located on the same tile, in which case they collide. To manage this, I have a function that will move them. This function takes a list of walkers all located at the same position, and calculate their next position:  -- this function takes a list of walkers that are at the same position. move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws &#x3D; ... 
 I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this function, because the pre-condition (walkers must be at the same position) is not encoded in the type. I&#x27;m thinking of several solutions: 1. Encode the precondition as a guard 2. Decompose the argument 3. Enforce property with refined types
 Encode the precondition as a guard
  move :: [Walker] -&gt; [Walker] move ws | isSamePos ws &#x3D; ... move _ &#x3D; error &quot;All walkers must be at the same position&quot;.  It&#x27;s an OK solution, however it&#x27;s a pity that the type doesn&#x27;t help you.
 Decompose the argument
 I could decompose the list of walkers, removing the redundant part (they all have the same position):  move :: Pos -&gt; [Dir] -&gt; [Walker] move pos dirs &#x3D; ...  That solution is interesting, because illegal states are now unrepresentable. However, I lost the idea that the input is a walker.
 Enforce property with refined types
 I could use Liquid Haskell to check the precondition using a SAT solver. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to write it, it seems a bit overkill.
 What is your opinion? Thanks!

 Is there a way to configure F5 to run a terminal and use GHCi to run my program?

 On MacOS, I use Hammerspoon, and I assigned a shortcut to it&#x27;s console and then promptly forgot it. Would love to hit M-x Hammerspoon-console anywhere and have it brought up. 
 Wondering if there&#x27;s anything like that already available?
 There&#x27;s built-in spotlight, and alfredapp but I would prefer to leverage emacs further.

                              <span>hi all,
 a package that i am using defines an a-list of various font properties f.e. &#x27;family&#x27;, &#x27;weight&#x27;, &#x27;height&#x27; etc. etc.
 i want to set values to these properties progammatically, f.e. on linux + my-home-machine i would want to set &#x27;family&#x27; to say &quot;Iosevka Mono&quot;, on my laptop i would use a high-dpi friendly font etc.
 i wrote a trivial function like so:
  (defun util:get-host-default-font-family () &quot;return host specific font-family&quot; (interactive) (cond ((utils:host-name-is &quot;host-01&quot;) Iosevka Mono&quot;) ((utils:host-name-is &quot;host-02&quot;) &quot;Go Mono Regular&quot;) ((t &quot;Consolas&quot;)))) 
 the &quot;utils:host-name-is &quot; returns &#x27;true&#x27; when current hostname matches the provided argument, &#x27;false&#x27; otherwise. the above function does the right thing when called interactively on different hosts. 
 however, when i use it like so
  (:default-family (util:get-host-default-font-family)) 
 i get a
  Wrong type argument: stringp, (util:get-host-default-font-family) 
 how do i fix it ?
 
 thanks !

                              <span>I just found out that I can emacs as my IRC client with ERC which is great. However, there are a couple of issues that I am wondering if Emacs supports: the first is that the message prompt is terminal style, which means that it keeps moving as I receive messages. Is there a way to replicate the interface of other IRC clients where there is a separate frame for inputing messages?
 The second issue is that it seems that receiving files from an XDCC server does not work. Is there some special configuration for it to work?

                              <span>In my config https://github.com/vidbina/dotfiles/tree/reorg-for-lit-prog/emacs#-text you may spot that I use visual-fill-column-mode and adaptive-wrap-mode to improve the readability of text in Emacs.
 ⚠️ The gotcha is that I sometimes have bits of context that I want to exclude from being &quot;wrapped&quot; such as tables. My current UX on this is poor as I usually want to see the table fully extended while simultaneously sneaking a peak at text in the paragraphs around it. Is there a way to do this (exclude a region from being wrapped) or is there a term that describes what I&#x27;m looking for that I should factor into my web-search queries?
 🤔 There is never really a use case where the wrapped table is even readable for me so it&#x27;s just a lost piece of screen real estate when I wrap the buffer. It may as well be folded away to be conjured up through something similar to C-c C-v v where can open expanded code into a preview buffer (to see how all the noweb refs resolve). How do you deal with wrapping when tables are present? Hoping to learn what I can improve about my usage to minimize this &quot;pain&quot;.
 💡 For now I keep toggling between the wrapped and non-wrapped states and now that I&#x27;m typing this, I&#x27;m thinking that I can open a cloned frame or buffer. That way I can show the table non-wrapped or extended in one buffer, while I look at the wrapped peripheral text in a cloned buffer and thus have a way to keep the wrapped states apart. This however does alter the layout of buffers which is again a bit of a UX killer as it disturbs the y-flow of the text in the original buffer if you catch my drift.
 Looking fwd to getting schooled. Thanks for helping think along. 🙏🏿

                              <span>Hi all,
 Relatively new to emacs. I&#x27;m looking to use emacs speaks statistics and take advantage of using polymode and quarto mode (https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-emacs) which best I can tell is a version of polymode that allows using quarto based documents.
 So far I can build the quarto document and output a html window, but if I try to run individual chunks or pieces of code it doesn&#x27;t work. The github page states it uses ESS by default but when I try to use the ESS run commands I get Wrong type argument: window-live-p, nil. I&#x27;ve googled this error message but haven&#x27;t seen anything similar so far.
 I&#x27;ve also tried having polymode itself enabled with quarto mode and on its own, and using the polymode run chunks command but I get a similar error message.
 Anyone have any ideas or potential solutions?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently replaced my old FHD monitors with QHD and UHD (4k) ones. I can change DPI to increase font sizes of Emacs and other applications, but cannot change the size of the mouse cursor for EXWM.
 I first tried to change the cursor size by following https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/612138/502857 . However, the new mouse cursor size is only applied when the cursor is not over an Emacs buffer.
 A mouse cursor over an Emacs buffer.
 A mouse cursor over Google-chrome
 There is an Emacs option for the color of the mouse cursor, but the option for the size doesn&#x27;t exist in Emacs 27.2 .
 Is it possible to change the size of the cursor for EXWM?

                              <span>I&#x27;m running multiple versions of Doom side by side and it seems that when a session fails to start properly clearing out ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx makes the problem go away.
 I can only guess that the Doom sessions orChemacs2 sessions read some compiled scripts in that directory which are not compatible with them. From the Doom docs, there is an EMACSDIR environment variable that is supposed to be the ~/.emacs.d directory for that Doom session.
 After reading the docs I have decided to run doom install with --doomdir, --emacsdir, and I am also configuring the Chemacs2 ~/.emacs-profiles.el to set the relevant environment variables as described in https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xs0avw/a_way_to_manage_multiple_doom_profiles_with/, which now includes more variables.
 Moving forward I am also adding the EMACSDIR option.
 Should these options reduce the risk of a shared ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28-xxxxx?

 One type of operation I&#x27;m finding hard time to replicate is the custom operator-pending mappings. In lisp like files, I use operators from vim-sexp a lot. 
 e.g. similarly to caw (change a word), the plugin adds daf (delete a form), cae (change an element), etc. 
 How can I replicate them? I&#x27;m having a hard time to find related docs, it seems that &quot;operator&quot; has other meanings in emacs.

Also, is this &quot;package&quot; related to the commonly used practice, when using use-package, of writing something like

 to keep things organized?

                              <span>Hey! I’m experimenting with some pretty non-standard layouts’ configurations (using a lot of xkb features like custom types and actions) to work around some wrists problems, multiple languages/layouts I need to work with also attempting to get to a setup that doesnt break the flow (e.g. standard layouts for english and ukrainian have weirdly different placements of non-alphanumerics which doesnt help at all to internilize the physical typing habbits, etc.)
 So far its starting to look pretty well but I have the major problem with getting my multiple layouts work in Emacs.
 Given that at different times a same key on my keyboard could generate a different symbol from six different alphabets, I’m trying to understand how to get emacs bindings to work invariantly to this (well ordered) chaos.
 An idea that came to my mind was this: if emacs did have a central function that performs a key lookup - it could’ve been probably advised - in case of a failed search - to change all the latin letters in the failed to be found sequence to the ones from the other alphabet I use and rerun the search. And do it for every of the languages of interest until it either works out or finally fails.
 I wasn’t able though to confirm from the elisp reference that this is possible)
 Sorry for the probable naivety of this question - I’m really not that familiar yet with Emacs internals and not speaking from arrogance here - just trying to describe my thought process trying to both explain what I need and not to overload the reader with complexities of my setup.
 Probably there is some true and very different way to solve tgis question that I’m not aware of.
 Thank you :)

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am no developer, only a Linux freaks for nearly 20 years. And a drummer. I need to work my rudiments. You know, these combinations of patterns on the bass drums, the snare and the Charley. I have already written a few charts in lilypond / Frescobaldi.
 And I am figuring out that it would be cool to develop an app for emacs that uses lilypond and the various combinations bd/snare/charley patterns to shows exercices to be worked out.
 The question is: is it affordable for someone like me, to start on such a project? I&#x27;d like to learn, but I need something motivating... And this would be it.
 Is Lisp a good idea for such a project? Or would Python be a better choice?
 If you have a few crumbs to lead me in the right direction, so that at least I start on the right path.. that&#x27;d be cool

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 I use doom emacs to edit math notes, full of latex fragments, in org mode.
 I really need to have a quick way to toggle the renderization of all fragments in a document, as if I was going to each one of them with the cursor and doing M-x org-latex-preview, which of course I have keymapped to an easier binding (SPC l p).
 I saw on the web that a way to do this would be prepending C-u to org-latex-preview (in my case C-u SPC l p). But C-u is bound to evil-scroll-up, thus preventing me to do any other combination starting with that C-u. 
 So I&#x27;ve been trying to disable the binding of C-u from evil-scroll-up. 
 Note: in the afterthought, that is not really what I should have been doing, because instead it would be way better to use something like SPC l l p. 
 Anyway, I tried p…</span>

 I recently moved from helm-swoop to helm-occur. In helm-swoop, search results are shown in the same color that the major mode shows with syntax coloring. However, helm-occur shows search results as a single color. I checked the customize-group for both helm and helm-occur but could not find a variable for this. 
 Is there a way to make syntax coloring enabled in the helm-occur buffer?
 Thanks.

 I currently still have different directories, and have defined the keys 1-7 in dired-mode-map to open them. But of course it would be nice to just enter the first letters of the file name in Helm Mini in the case that I know the file name, which currently only works for recent files and for files in my Org directory.

 For my terminal (alacritty), the font is in size: 13 #Point Size
 For emacs, I have tried these two: but they just seem smaller than the 13 point size font set for my terminal. I had to set emacs&#x27; font :height to 140 or use &quot;Liberation Mono-14&quot; for the font size to more similar :(
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;Liberation Mono&quot; :height 130)
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;Liberation Mono-13&quot;)
 Any tips guys?

                              <span>Hi folks,
 This is probably quite a simple question and more to do with Emacs Lisp syntax than anything else. I&#x27;m trying to set Org&#x27;s org-tag-alist variable so that a directory containing all my projects can easily have the type of project categorised according to some default tags. Unfortunately, the .dir-locals.el file uses different syntax (dot notation?) to what I&#x27;m already barely used to with regular Emacs Lisp, so I&#x27;m struggling to make it work. In particular, I&#x27;m trying to get some group tags in that variable, but I&#x27;m utterly clueless because I just haven&#x27;t had the time to learn Emacs Lisp yet.
 Could anyone supply a minimum working example of a .dir-locals.el snippet that adds group tags to Org mode? Many, many thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi, 
 Over the years I have discovered that the sub is divided fairly evenly over eglot and lsp-mode. I was wondering, what makes users prefer one over the other? 
 I am evaluating moving over from lsp-mode, now that eglot is shipped with emacs and it supports emacs-native features where possible. I mainly use python, julia, and web-devvy things like typescript, tsx, css, and html.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I recently released Tecton, a new DSL for authoring CSS. My goal for this project is to make &quot;CSS in PureScript&quot; more practical for real-world use cases, meaning: * Extensive type-level validation * Minimal syntactic overhead * Broad CSS coverage * Alignment with W3C specifications * Exhaustive testing
 If you&#x27;re interested to take a look, a good place to start might be the Zen Garments example, adapted from Dan Mall&#x27;s CSS Zen Garden submission in order to assess the library&#x27;s CSS coverage.
 From there, you might like to see some examples of CSS errors that will fail to compile. Some of these issues are significantly more complicated than e.g. providing a  value where a  was expected (although those cases are covered too).
 Hopefully the next step would be to try it out for yourself, using the large test suite as a reference wherever the (WIP) docs currently fall short.
 I am looking forward to any feedback you might have to offer! I would also like to note that contributions are welcome, so please let me know if you are interested via Twitter or [email](mailto:nick@saunde.rs); or, if you have something specific in mind already, just review the contributing guidelines and then open an issue.
 Thanks for reading!

                              <span>Currently, I would like to learn fs2 thoroughly (how it works, and build some different size of applications with it).
 Before I jump right into learning fs2, I would like to understand its bigger picture. However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find any useful information about what are the possible use cases of fs2, for what we can use this awesome library, and so on.
 To my understanding, fs2 is used when we don&#x27;t know the size of the incoming data.
 I am looking for answers to these questions:
  
How does a REST-based microservice look like when it heavily relies on fs2?
 Can you suggest good learning resources for fs2? (for example: github projects...)
 What are the possible use-cases for fs2?
 Can we increase throughput by using fs2 instead of using only cats-effect? (for example in a REST-based microservice?)

to give you a heads-up:
Translating &quot;Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen&quot;
I am working on a special translation of the Original article by Luhmann. The problem of translation can be partly understood by these two quotes from the disclaimer I am writing:

  
French is a fine park, Italien a big, bright, colorful wood. But German is almost a primeval forest, so dense and mysterious, so without a passage and yet with thousand paths. You can&#x27;t get lost in a park, and not so easily and dangerously in the bright Italian wood; but in the German jungle, within four, five minutes, you can go missing. Because the path seems so difficult, many try to march through as straight as possible which violates the nature of this language. It surely wants a main direction but invites to deviate from t…</span>

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I&#x27;ve just started using Org and I am fascinated by it and the possibilities it offers over every other system I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve started tinkering with custom agenda views, and I&#x27;ve got this fairly basic custom view happening with the following code:
  (setq org-agenda-files &#x27;(&quot;~/Documents/projects&quot;)) (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;Programming todos&quot; ((tags &quot;programming&quot;))))) 
 Now, I have a number of projects in that projects directory whose top-level headline is marked with the WAIT TODO keyword, but whose children are marked with regular TODO. My logic here is that I want to mark an entire project as waiting or blocked without having to mark every subtree or subtask as waiting, too.
 The problem is, when I use my custom agenda view, the project headline appears (albeit greyed-out), and all its children appear. Is there a way to exclude an entire tree from appearing in a custom agenda view if its headline or one of its parents is marked with a certain keyword, in this case, WAIT?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

 e.g. when I use WinHugs and notepad, I can write code in notepad and then run the code in WinHugs and test functions.

                              <span>So I usually use atom for most programming and was trying to find haskell packages but found none and then went to sublime and was finally able to find some syntax highlighting. Which IDEs are the most popular IDEs for haskell in industry just like c/c++ has Visual Studio, intellij for IDEA and vs code for javascript ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use the cabal mixins feature to automatically replace every implicit prelude import with a custom prelude (in this case relude). apparently it doesn&#x27;t play well with &#x60;stack repl&#x60; https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5077 but I don&#x27;t really use it anyway.
 Problem is the example projects there all use stack to import pure cabal projects, the latter of which do have mixins, but are not stack-ified themselves. In my case, I want to be able to add something to package.yaml or stack.yaml like:
 -- package.yaml (or stack.yaml) cabal-fields: mixins: base hiding (Prelude) - relude (Relude as Prelude) - relude 
 or something like that, just so that the .cabal file stack generates has this option enabled. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to do this. Some help?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Inliner by Jones &amp; Marlow (2002), and am trying to understand the &quot;subtlety&quot; they mention about the rapier algorithm.
 On the bottom left corner of page 7, they mention:
  
There is one other important subtlety in this algorithm: in the case where x is not in theta we must delete x from the substitution, denoted phi \ x. How could x be in the domain of the substitution, but not be in scope?
  
However, the authors do not elaborate much further due to space constraints.
 I&#x27;m trying to understand what they meant by this comment. Although I can fabricate inputs that produce the scenario they describe, I&#x27;m not sure what concrete example would lead to that input, nor why it&#x27;s important to handle it the way they do.
 Also, the paper only shows two cases of their substitution algorithm that handles lambdas. Do we fall through to the second case if we fail the guard of the first case (i.e., when we match on a lambda introduces a variable already in-scope)? That is, am I correct in reading that as pseudo-Haskell?

                              <span>Hey everyone! I recently started using Emacs+ESS for writing R code, and I am really liking it so far, Emacs is impressively extensible &amp; flexible. There is however one thing I am missing: keybindings to insert some special snippets/characters I use really frequently. Specifically, I want to bind Control-Shift-m to insert the R pipe operator „%&gt;%“, and Alt-i to insert the assignment arrow „&lt;-“, like in RStudio, as not having these bindings sort of disrupts my workflow. What would be the best way to do this in Lisp?

                              <span>I&#x27;m honestly not sure if this is an issue with emacs or screen, but I&#x27;ll try here. Middle of the day today, emacs started acting weird for me: The status line (the one with the mode and file/buffer name) started being underlined instead of reverse, and when I scroll down whatever buffer I&#x27;m editing, ALL of the text gets underlined. This makes it very hard and annoying to edit.
 I&#x27;m on a mac, and this only happens when I run emacs under screen. But I depend on screen, and do everything in a screen session, ingrained habit of decades that would be very hard to change.
 I&#x27;ve been using emacs in plain text shell sessions running under screen on macs for many many years, and I&#x27;ve never seen this before. It started in the middle of the day, in a screen instance I&#x27;ve had running on this mac since…</span>

                              <span>I use TRAMP to connect to GitHub Codespaces via my Codespaces package. However, I noted recently that my TRAMP sessions were suffering tremendous and unignorable lag when navigating within a file. I went through my enabled modes one-by-one and was surprised to learn that vc-mode was, in this case, the culprit. Setting vc-handled-backends like so:
 (setq vc-handled-backends &#x27;(Git)) 
 had a profound effect on latency. I&#x27;m not sure why this is the case, but its original value holds a bunch of entries for VCSs that died decades ago (CVS, SCCS, RCS…): it&#x27;s possible that one of my packages was using all of vc-mode&#x27;s backends.
 My TRAMP sessions to Codespaces are now as responsive and fast as if I were to connect to them via VS Code. Hope this helps someone!

                              <span>Hey Emacs friends! 
 I&#x27;m putting together a little package to preview markdown files similarly to how they are rendered on GitHub. Previously I&#x27;ve used grip (and grip-mode), which are awesome, but I wanted a little more room for customization and to avoid hitting the GitHub API on every change.
 This package does the rendering locally if your Emacs has xwidget support. I&#x27;d really appreciate any feedback anyone has!

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been using org-mode and org-roam for a bit. I&#x27;m finding that my notes are kind of getting into a mess but that&#x27;s mostly because of my insane life contexts I guess.
 Here is kind of where I&#x27;m at in life, for context:
  
Work (routine stuff, development projects underway, ideas, I have a bit of a management role but it&#x27;s really spread out over a bunch of contexts in and of itself (different functional areas I manage)
 Business 1
 Business 2
 Personal Life
 Personal development projects
 Education goals
 Investment goals/research
  
I like keeping notes and todos together, but I think separate contexts is a good idea so if I&#x27;m in work mode I&#x27;m not seeing all the stuff I need to do in my business. Something I&#x27;m kind of wanting to is a way to mark something as delegated to X person. I don&#x27;t need them to see that I delegated it, just to remind myself that I told them to do something and to follow up.
 ​
 I started out with a regular org file for each context, then ended up creating new org files for each &quot;thing&quot;, which created my mess. Today I decided to try creating dailies in org-roam to see how that works out.
 ​
 Any suggestions for how to keep life organized in org or org-roam when you&#x27;ve got so much going on. From experience, no todo list/notes manager has ever really worked that well for this for me.... a few were okay (todoist on the todo list side and evernote on the notes side.... but they both had their own issues)
 ​
 I like org and org-roam I&#x27;m just struggling with how best to setup a structure that fits such a lifestyle.
 Any thoughts or input is very welcome...

                              <span>A thought occurred to me today while I was getting ready, mentally preparing. I realized that I was feeling a bit stressed about the day but that the thought of my todo and agenda buffers had a calming effect. I thought to myself, &quot;it&#x27;s alright, you&#x27;re organized and at least if there is chaos it is somewhat documented chaos and you don&#x27;t have to hold it all in your mind.&quot;
 Last weekend, I took the time to do a much needed cleanup of my init.el file. I got rid of all the cruft of comments, things I&#x27;d tried but given up though not yet deleted. I made a move to using straight.el as my package manager. I switched from Ivy to Helm. I just did some things I&#x27;d been meaning to do for a while. I cleaned up my todo file and recommitted to using &#x27;C-c a a&#x27; more throughout the day.
 I assume that many of you, like me, find a certain &quot;gee, that&#x27;s neat&quot; quality to getting some of this working. A sense of satisfaction maybe. I like learning new ways to do things, maybe cleaner, tighter. But the thing that I keep coming back to even more than all that is that this technology, this nerdy system, has a way of calming me and making me feel better. It feels like the world has more and more information each day, more chaos, etc. Using org-mode helps me live in the world.
 I was curious to see if any of you have had similar thoughts about it?

                              <span>Bazel is a great tool for describing monorepo builds. This is especially the case when one
has to deal with more than one technology or language within the same
repository. In this blog post I am going to demonstrate how to convert the Makefile
build of example-servant-elm to Bazel. Well…
maybe not all at once. In the first post of this series, I’d like to focus only
on the Haskell components of the example-servant-elm project. The following post
will cover the Bazel build for the front-end (Elm) component.
This blog post is, after a fashion, an extension of the talk given by
Andreas Herrmann during ZuriHac 2021. I want to slightly
modify Andreas’ approach here, especially the part which relates to the Haskell

                              <span>I am really new to Haskell and I came across this discussion about how closures in Haskell can be used to mimic objects in traditional OOP. 
 Needless to say, I did not understand much of the discussion. What is really confusing to me is that, if A is an instance of an object (in the traditional sense) then I can change and update some property A.property of A. This doesn&#x27;t create a new instance of A, it updates the value. Exactly, how is this particular updating achieved via closures in Haskell? 
 I understand that mutability can have bad side effects and all. But if a property of an instance of an object, call it A.property for example, were to be updated many times throughout a program how can we possibly keep track of that in Haskell?
 I would really appreciate ELI5 answer if possible. Thank you for your time!!!

                              <span>I drank the Kool-aid and I love it. I can&#x27;t quite articulate what it is that I love about this language but since I learned how to use it... I use it for everything. I occasionally would like a CLI tool that doesn&#x27;t exist on apt, and so I build it myself. I used to use C for this, and now it&#x27;s Haskell! The other day I was thinking of spinning up a chess clone because I wanted to build an AI that could beat me at chess (without looking up how chess engines work, just as a puzzle) and I thought, why not Haskell?
 Something about programming in Haskell makes me feel like a god genius programmer. She&#x27;s so fast, so sleek, such a pure functional mathematical language. It&#x27;s easily my favorite language by far and I just can&#x27;t quite figure out what it is that makes me geek the fuck out about it. 
 Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

                              <span>Hey everyone, really dumb question but I think I understand this wrong. Ok so... say i had this function 
 f :: a -&gt; Bool
 f x &#x3D; x&#x3D;&#x3D;0 
 However, since im using the &quot;&#x3D;&#x3D;&quot; operator, to tell haskell that i wont be using any other type other than the ones to which (&#x3D;&#x3D;) has instances, Id make it this correct? 
 f :: (Eq a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Bool
 f x &#x3D; x&#x3D;&#x3D;0 
 But this throws an error telling me i also have to include (Num a) &#x3D;&gt;
 Why is that? I&#x27;m not using any operator that is in the Num a class... Why does it need this? Isn&#x27;t the whole point of overloading to restrict &quot;a&quot; to only be a type which has an instance in the used operator/function?? What makes me add (Num a) &#x3D;&gt; here too?

                              <span>I just wanted to check within the community on the status of using GHCJS for larger projects.
 Is everyone just locked on 8.6 or earlier like we are?
 It seems like https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/issues/821 is a rigid dealbreaker for any sizable project.
 Our setup of using a hybrid of ghcjs-8.6, ghc-8.6 and ghc-8.10 works well enough, but I&#x27;d be lying if I said it wasn&#x27;t being heavily stress tested.
 I&#x27;m hoping that ghc-9.6 can potentially come to the rescue with a JS backend, but I was curious if there are other solutions on the horizon.

 Can we great a type of unknown amount of .... data?
 I know with record syntax we can create 
 data somedata &#x3D;{ sum:: String, sum:: Int}
 What&#x27;s stopped me from using Haskell for my everyday data science projects was with record syntax I would to modify things so the types and headers to the csv files matched.
 Which is a pain if I am just wanting to download data and play with it.
 Is there a way to create types, say similar to a Dataframe in Python or R where you can turn a CSV to a DataFrame?

                              <span>MicroPython runs on some embedded systems. It provides a Python REPL through the serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyACM0). One can use it through (serial-term &quot;/dev/ttyACM0&quot; 9600) from within Emacs.
 On the other hand python-mode provides some functionality (like python-shell-send-buffer or python-shell-send-defun) to interact with an active, locally running python3 REPL.
 I&#x27;d like to be able to send Python code from a Python-file buffer directly (without me copying and pasting) to the MicroPython REPL.
 Any idea how to achieve that?

                              <span>I&#x27;m not an emacs power user nor very proficient at elisp.
 I use magit quite heavily in emacs, and I&#x27;m regularly working on multiple git repositories at the same time. These are different repositories/worktrees for the same project, just with different branches checked out. I&#x27;m not sure if it is relevant, but these are Perl projects, using cperl-mode, and each project has a single TAGS files at the project root. The first time I use &#x60;M-.&#x60; (&#x60;xref-find-definitions&#x60;), I get prompted to load a TAGS file, and I select the one for the current repository I&#x27;m using. This works as expected. However when I happen to be editing a file from a different repository and hit M-., the previously loaded TAGS file is still used, so this brings me to the source file from the wrong repository. Since the files look identical, I don&#x27;t notice this and regularly make edits in the wrong git worktree.
 I saw that I can load multiple tags tables using visit-tags-table, and then switch between them using select-tags-table. Is there any way to automate this so that when I use &#x60;M-.&#x60; it automatically chooses the TAGS file closest to the current file path? I looked into project.el and projectile, but I couldn&#x27;t find any examples for how to do this.

                              <span>Today I discovered there are two built in variables that you can customize in org-faces to achieve a style similar org-modern. However, there are limitations, for example, org-modern add space paddings to improve the visuals, which you cannot do with these two variables.
 Exactly for that reason, I will have little use for this discovery, and would rather keep it out of my .emacs.d. But hey, maybe someone would make use of this somehow :).
 You should be able to see an example also below. 
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;org-faces (setq org-todo-keyword-faces (append (cl-loop for todo in &#x27;(&quot;TODO&quot; &quot;NEXT&quot; &quot;STARTED&quot; &quot;PROJECT&quot; &quot;HOLD&quot;) with faces &#x3D; &#x27;(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-todo)) collect (cons todo faces)) (cl-loop for todo in &#x27;(&quot;CANCELLED&quot; &quot;DONE&quot;) with faces &#x3D; &#x27;(:height 0.8 :inherit (org-modern-done)) collect (cons todo faces))) org-priority-faces (cl-loop with end &#x3D; org-priority-lowest for i from org-priority-highest to end collect (list i :inherit &#x27;org-modern-priority)))) 
 Here a gist link to the same snippet, acting as a backup.

                              <span>I have compiled it a few times and it is a bit of a beast to compile.
 I&#x27;d rather install from an existing package.
 Emacs should be like PostgreSQL. As soon as there is a new release the packages arrive immediately.

                              <span>This started with package-selected-packages not behaving correctly. For some reason it only evaluated to about 5 packages, while it listed over 20 in custom-set-variables. This continued whatever I did (-Q didn&#x27;t help). So I tried moving my init.el. Without an init.el, package-selected-packages evaluates correctly. However, when I try to put it back, Emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize it. What&#x27;s going on?
 Edit: apparently, at some point, Emacs auto-generated a .emacs file. I&#x27;ve deleted it and init.el is recognised now, but the issue with package-selected-packages still remains.

 I watched a couple videos on System Crafter&#x27;s YouTube channel and I like how he can put configuration and initialization code specific for a package within the use-package construct. It seems very tidy and organized.
 I&#x27;m going to start playing with it but thought I&#x27;d see if anyone else has gotten it to work. It might be that I will need to set :ensure nil in each so use-package doesn&#x27;t try to load the package since el-get will have already done it.

 What&#x27;s the best style set of keybindings (in your opinion) for Emacs, and &quot;Why?&quot;.
 Background:
  
I ask this since I have a keybinding to easily switch to Vim style keybindings a la &#x27;Evil Mode&#x27;, but only do so for programming purposes. 
 Everywhere else I use Emacs style keybindings (Org Mode, etc).
 I also use a few custom Hydras as well for weird things like buffer rotation, etc.
  
Curious what you crazy Emacs wizards use these days (ex: Xah Fly Keys, etc). Feel free to provide the &quot;What&quot; you use individual keybinding sets for as well.
 Let&#x27;s have at it, let the best keybindings win! :)

 While I love org-mode, and would much rather use it than any other option, I still have a hard time because I manage a lot of my tasks through my phone. Same for content consumption, I do a lot on my phone thus cannot save anything easily in org.
 I&#x27;ve tried orgzly, but it does not really fit me. 
 How do you manage all that ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hey, I put together a Emacs dynamic module for greetd-ipc. With this we can use Emacs as a greeter for greetd. Here is the repo https://git.sr.ht/~declantsien/egreet and a demo https://i.imgur.com/m3ppyg8.mp4
 The rust code are mainly borrowed from agreety. And I am using the Emacs Module in Rust crate here.
 For those who are not familar with greetd. greetd is a minimal, agnostic and flexible login manager daemon.

                              <span>Just thought I&#x27;d document this fix here.
 I have Emacs running portably on Dropbox through a batch script that sets the HOME environment variable:
 REM Set the environment variable HOME, which Emacs uses as the base directory. set HOME&#x3D;%~dp0 REM Run Emacs, passing any parameters to it as well. &quot;D:\Dropbox\Apps\emacs\emacs-28.1\bin\runemacs.exe&quot; %* 
 I began getting this error whenever I tried to list ELPA packages:
 Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: No public key for _____________ created at 2022-10-18T08:05:04+1100 using RSA Command output: gpg: keyblock resource &#x27;/d/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/d:/Dropbox/Apps/emacs/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/pubring.kbx&#x27;: No such file or directory gpg: Signature made Tue Oct 18 08:05:04 2022 AUSEST gpg: using RSA key _________________ gpg: Can&#x27;t check signature: No public key 
 My googling led me to this Stack Exchange thread which noted that this was caused by the homedir expansion producing an invalid directory path.
 The fix in my init.el is therefore:
 (setq package-gnupghome-dir &quot;elpa/gnupg&quot;) 
 This creates the keys in the directory that Emacs expects (.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg/) and allows the whole thing to work.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using an alist as a means of counting occurrences of characters in a string. However, the values associated with a key in the alist are persistent across function calls, even though I reset the alist in a let form (and, well, it&#x27;s inside a function!). Here is a minimal working example. Calling my/test multiple times continually increases the alist values:
 (defun my/test () (let ((my/alist &#x27;((a . 0) (b . 0)))) (incf (alist-get &#x27;a my/alist)) (incf (alist-get &#x27;b my/alist)) my/alist)) 
 What am I doing wrong? Something tells me the problem is with incf, but I cannot understand how my/alist is stored in memory, since it should have its scope inside the function and be reset when let is run.

                              <span>I basically want to create a very basic elisp function that calls the org-timer-set-timer to set a timer for 25 minutes, and then when that finishes it starts a second timer that is for 5 minutes. The code below is my attempt at a function to create a timer, but how do I have it start the second timer when the first one finishes? Thank you for the help!
 (defun start-timer ()

 A very basic question that I didn&#x27;t manage to answer via Google: I can&#x27;t figure out how to input a vertical bar in OrgMode (|) even though option + 7 works in other non-Emacs applications.
 Does anyone have any insight into why this might be? Edit: I&#x27;m using Emacs for MacOS.

 My Org Headlines
 Currently, my headlines style like this which…isn&#x27;t particularly helpful? The first 3 tend to blur together, for me, and the 4th look like comments, rather than a headline.
 I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d change them to so I thought I&#x27;d ask what others are doing and/or theirs look like, get me brain rolling with some ideas.

                              <span>I am a FTE Linux kernel dev, I use bare bones Emacs and have been wondering if maybe I should add LSP support, as I hear it&#x27;s technically possible to use a LS with the kernel. Anyone do this today, or have advice on how to configure Eglot for the kernel? All I have ever used is cscope and ctags. I&#x27;d like to get it working so that the LSP server picks up the correct headers for the build arch and picks up all the GCC flags.
 I also usually run my builds inside of a container so I don&#x27;t use my system&#x27;s gcc toolchain.
 I am not an Emacs wizard, so detailed instructions for an idiot are most welcome.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Trying to fix bugs in a package that&#x27;s gone a bit stale so I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to use edebug. Edebug manual is pretty dense and a couple of weeks between debugging sessions I forget how to run it. In the spirit of &quot;learning in public&quot; here&#x27;s a quick screen cast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;560QrNt-a_w
 This should really be accompanied by a blog post, and it&#x27;s kinda there in my notes. Would love some feedback.

By default my vim configuration used the vim clipboard for most things but I had keybindings to copy and paste to the system clipboard. Setting this varible I was able to stop emacs from clobbering my system clipboard but I don&#x27;t see any commands to copy and paste from the system clipboard.
 ​
 (setq x-select-enable-clipboard nil)

 Thanks!

 I noticed that there is no completion for an object. For example, if A is object and I type A., I get nothing after the dot. Explicate executing completion-at-point returns nothing either. 
 This happens no matter if the class of A is defined in the project or defined in a library. I assume lsp should be able to find the member functions. Am I missing some config? If there is a better system, I would like to try. Thanks.

                              <span>Is it possible to have bookmarks update their location based on where your cursor is?
 For instance, if I create a bookmark in file A on line 1, move to line 2, switch to file B, then jump to my bookmark from file A, I would like to be on line 2.
 I just switched over from vim and I was able to implement it using vimscript auto commands, but I am not as good at elisp.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I am building my emacs on the bas of the nano-emacs of Nicolas Rougier. I am testing several of his own config features, and I get this error.
 With debug init, I get this:
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function org-make-tags-matcher) (org-make-tags-matcher &quot;*&quot;) (cdr (org-make-tags-matcher &quot;*&quot;)) (defvar my/org-imenu-filter-function (cdr (org-make-tags-matcher &quot;*&quot;)) &quot;Filter function to decide if a headline is kept&quot;) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;c:/Users/f/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; &quot;c:/xxxxx/.emacs.d/init.el&quot; t t) load(&quot;c:/Users/f/.emacs.d/init&quot; noerror nomessage) startup--load-user-init-file(#f(compiled-function () #) #f(compiled-function () #) t) command-line() normal-top-level()
 I looked into the help, the variable exists, it comes with org.el. I looked into org.el and found the variable... I do not understand why I am getting this error.
 Any idea? Thx!

                              <span>I need to do some work on a large repository which already contains a large number of eclipse project files. They apparently can&#x27;t be removed, and they are a real pain when I try to use lsp java as it updates many of them and creates a lot of new ones.
 No problem, I thought, I&#x27;ll just create a parallel directory structure and symlink things in places, and then import that into lsp. However, at some point in the process of importing the project (based on Maven pom files) it canonicalises some paths and ends up importing the original directory structure.
 I realise this is more of an underlying Eclipse issue, rather than an Emacs one, but does anybody have a good suggestion for how to work round this?

                              <span>Hi everyone,I have an interactive function that moves currently opened file into different folder.I do it with rename-file.
 The issue is that when the file is moved, the buffer opened doesn&#x27;t really know about it and after any change in the buffer and then save, the file gets saved into old location.
 How do I associate a buffer with new location? I found somewhere that I can use &#x60;write-file&#x60; function and it suppose to change &quot;the pointer&quot; to file but it didn&#x27;t. It does write to specified location but save-buffer still saves it into old file.
 Thanks

 Side question: Is it expected one would chose an export target (eg PDF) a priori or do people generally intend to ship to any and all platforms?

                              <span>I am at my wits end. I think I have bound a texture(I have never seen it), and specified texture coordinates for each vertex, but due to the insane statefullness and pretty much complete lack of documentation (for the high level API), I&#x27;ve spent more than a few hours just trying to get an image on a quad in the background of my window. My quad just ends up colored as the other quads. How do I specify the use of a texture instead of color? If someone could provide a minimal example of actually getting a texture on a surface, I would be very grateful. This is the relevant function:
 drawBackground texRef &#x3D; preservingMatrix $ do matrixMode $&#x3D; Projection loadIdentity ortho2D (-1/2) (1/2) (-1/2) (1/2) matrixMode $&#x3D; Modelview 0 translate $ Vector3 (-1/2) (-1/2) (0::GLfloat) tex &gt; v 0 0 t 1 0 &gt;&gt; v 1 0 t 1 1 &gt;&gt; v 1 1 t 0 1 &gt;&gt; v 0 1 where v x y &#x3D; vertex (Vertex3 (x) (y) (0) :: Vertex3 GLfloat) t u v &#x3D; texCoord (TexCoord2 u v :: TexCoord2 GLfloat) n &#x3D; normal $ (Normal3 0 0 1 :: Normal3 GLfloat)

                              <span>EDIT: Someone volunteered, and the proposal has been submitted. If the Haskell devroom gets accepted you will certainly hear from me again. There will be a call for proposals and for additional volunteers to make it a success. Thanks!
 I decided to propose a Haskell devroom (like a one/half-days pecialist track or miniconf) for FOSDEM 2023, to be held February 4--5 in Brussels (main site; call-for-devrooms). It would be great to promote Haskell among this audience and hopefully attract new contributors / community members.
 Unfortunately I left it quite late (deadline submission is today). I only just realised I need a secondary contact (i.e. co-organiser) to submit the proposal. So... any volunteers?
 Ideally you are located in Europe or definitely planning to attend FOSDEM. If you are willing, please message me here on Reddit or mail frase at frase dot id dot au. I think I all need right now is your name and email address (and enthusiasm).
 The text of my proposal may be found at https://github.com/frasertweedale/talks/blob/master/2022-02-xx-fosdem-haskell-devroom/proposal.md.
 I have experience organising and hosting FP miniconfs at linux.conf.au including running the CFP etc. I expect FOSDEM will be similar, just on the other side of the world from Australia, where I live.
 Thank you!

 What do you think about such piece of the code? Would you go that way? Is it anti-pattern? What&#x27;s your approach? 
 newtype CryptoService &#x3D; CryptoService { generateToken :: Seed -&gt; Token }
 myFancyCryptoService :: CryptoService
 myFancyCryptoService &#x3D; ...
 data EmailService &#x3D; EmailService
 { cryptoService :: CryptoService
 , sendEmailNotification :: Username -&gt; IO ()
 }
 myFancyEmailService :: EmailService
 myFancyEmailService &#x3D; { cryptoService &#x3D; myFancyCryptoService, ... }
 Thanks to that I am able to use cryptoService&#x27;s generateToken method while implementing sendEmailNotification.

                              <span>I search here, finding the newest discussion related to scalastyle is about 4 years ago. I am wondering if anyone is still using it?
 I have a personal project that I want to check if the code uses some specific type such as enumeration. I successfully setup custom rule. But when attempting to lookup methods provided by CompilationUnit[1]. I can&#x27;t find that code in scalastyle repo. Then further searching on the internet seems to me scalastyle community is not active anymore.
 If so, any alternative projects recommended? 
 Also where can I find the code or scaladoc CompilationUnit? 
 Many thanks.

                              <span>I’ve spent some time this summer extending Monad-Bayes, a
probabilistic programming library in Haskell. This was done in the context of a
Tweag open source fellowship, under the supervision of Dominic Steinitz. These
improvements are part of the upcoming 1.0 release of the library.
Briefly, what’s Monad-Bayes about? Like Church, Gen and
Pyropyro (among other probabilistic programming languages), it allows a user
to specify a Bayesian model as a program, and automates the process of
inferring the specified distribution. Unlike other languages, it is a
first-class library of its host language (Haskell), rather than an embedded
language. This means that any language feature in the host language is
available to you. It also means that you can have distributions over absolutely
anything. For in…</span>

                              <span>I am trying to better understand (and possibly, edit) some of the C files in the latest version of Emacs.
 Does anybody know of any good resources that go over what the general design patterns are, best practices, and tips on debugging?
 (Search engines haven&#x27;t been much help as most combinations of &#x27;emacs&#x27; and &#x27;C code&#x27; lead to results about configuring Emacs as an IDE for C)
 I am pretty familiar with Emacs-Lisp, and I can write and understand C pretty well, but I would like to get a good understanding of all the Emacs-specific things I&#x27;m seeing in the C code, such as how to go from C variables and structs to Lisp objects, the DEFUN macro, etc.
 The motivation behind this is that, as noted in a previous post, I&#x27;ve noticed that the xwidget-webkit feature is (partially) broken in the latest version for MacOS. I would like to try out some possible fixes: it looks like most issues are simply due to the fact that many functions are only defined for the GTK framework, and not Mac&#x27;s NextStep/Cocoa framework.
 Also, if anybody wants to help out with this effort, please let me know.
 ​
 UPDATE:
  
if you&#x27;re interested in understanding Emacs C source-code, take a look at this section of the official manual: I found the part about Writing Emacs Primitives especially helpful. Many thanks to u/7890yuiop!!!
 If you&#x27;re interested in the xwidget patches I&#x27;m working on, I&#x27;ve created this fork of the emacs mirror. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to fix everything, but it&#x27;s looking good and I&#x27;ve already implemented the estimated-load-progress function

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ve just installed twittering-mode on #Debian
 Unfortunately, I have problem with getting the token.
 ​
  
When starting M-x twit it appears &quot;HTTP(SSL) is not available.&quot;.
 I checked the dependencies - I&#x27;m sure I have openssl on the system.
 
Trying to authorize, an error appears.

In emacs i got this indentation in a file. When i clicking tab it was directly going 15 space forward after std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;enter another: &quot;;. The situation persist in just one file. Any idea what did this happen?

An answer was given but I don&#x27;t understand it at all. I also do not understand the hint to expand the macro. Emacs tells me these functions aren&#x27;t even macros, but special forms.

 I was told to repost because it was old.

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I just released a fork of all-the-icons-completion. I&#x27;ve added support for more completion categories (imenu, M-x, and more) by taking code from all-the-icons-ivy-rich. I&#x27;ve also added a few quality of life improvements, like proper icon aligning and scaling (once again ported from all-the-icons-ivy-rich). If you use all-the-icons-completion I&#x27;d recommend giving my fork a try.

 For example, marking messages as read and flag them at the same time; or marking messages as unflag and trash them at the same time.
 I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s possible somehow, but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I need help to track down an issue but I don&#x27;t know how to proceed. 
 A specific combination of things makes lsp-mode (with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode) cause lines below the cursor to move. Those circumstances are: 
  
Using one of the themes from Prot&#x27;s package ef-themes
 
cc-mode with lsp-mode, lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode 
  
There is no problem with the identical configuration using haskell/lsp-haskell or python/lsp-pyright or any other language. 
 Nor is there a problem using a different theme e.g. modus-vivendi 
 This video shows 3 short clips to demonstrate the problem. 
  
theme: ef-dark, editing a C file showing the unwanted movement
 
identical setup after using counsel-load-theme and choosing modus-vivendi- no unwanted movement
 
theme: ef-dark, but editing a haskell file again using lsp-mode with lsp-ui and lsp-ui-doc-mode - no unwanted movement
 
 I&#x27;m stuck now and looking for ideas to help me discover what could cause this and how to fix it.

                              <span>Start emacs -Q, create an .org file somewhere with the following contents and add it to the agenda (with org-agenda-file-to-front, say): 
 #+TODO: TODO WAIT | DONE * TODO This is a test :work: * WAIT This is another test :work: 
 Run (org-tags-view nil &quot;work+TODO&#x3D;\&quot;WAIT\&quot;&quot;) and you will see, as expected, an agenda view containing only the task tagged &quot;WAIT&quot;. 
 Quit the agenda and call org-todo-list, then run org-agenda-filter, and enter work+TODO&#x3D;&quot;WAIT&quot; at the prompt. Do you get the exact same result? I had assumed I would, but I do not. Instead I get this message: 
 ‘+TODO’ filter ignored because tag/category is not represented 
 So, questions: 
  
Is this as it should be? 
 Is there a way of using org-agenda-filter to filter out tasks with a specific todo keyword?
  
I realize I could do this: 
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;p&quot; &quot;Test&quot; tags &quot;+work+TODO&#x3D;\&quot;WAIT\&quot;&quot;))) 
 or perhaps use org-agenda-filter-by-regexp. My question is just whether org-agenda-filter should allow me to find all entries with a particular todo keyword, and if not, I guess I&#x27;d want to know why not?

                              <span>My brother recently died from suicide. We&#x27;re trying to pick up the pieces. Going through his stuff, I found a CD-R with the label &quot;emacs backup.&quot; I pop the disk into my computer; and while the computer recognizes it, it says the disk is unreadable. So I Google what emacs even is. He was into coding, and was even trying to create his own pixel art computer game thing. I figure the backup could be related to that kind of stuff.
 How do I get this CD to open? I installed emacs on my computer (I think?) and nothing changed? 
 (I do realize he could have also used it as a journal. Honestly, I want answers to questions, and I&#x27;ll never get them, now. Part of me hopes it is his journal. I&#x27;m already in therapy so it would just be one more thing to discuss, I guess. I won&#x27;t let my mom know. I&#x27;m desperate. Thank you.)

                              <span>I just posted this link in another thread and it occurred to me that others might find it useful:
 https://github.com/keithfancher/haskell-notes/blob/master/haskell-notes.md
 These are some notes I started taking about Haskell, specifically about topics I found confusing or which seemed to have many disparate sources of documentation. There&#x27;s stuff about installation, toolchain, and of course some oddities of the language itself. It collects some basic summaries of the info that I&#x27;ve gleaned so far and a bunch of links to stuff written by people a lot more knowledgeable than I am.
 Of course, to reiterate: I am a beginner. So take it all with a grain of salt! But that can also be useful, since I probably have a similar perspective to all the other beginners out there.
 Also note that it&#x27;s a work in progress! It&#x27;ll grow as I continue to learn (and write down) new stuff.
 Anyway, hope this helps somebody!

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 I am learning Haskell because I&#x27;ve heard so many great things. I had heard of the language before but Software Unscripted has inspired me to pursue it seriously and dedicate some time to it. 
 So far it&#x27;s really interesting! I&#x27;ve not had that &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment but it&#x27;s only been a week or so. 
 One thing I&#x27;m wondering: Can I change the cabal output directory? 
 Right now the output goes to:
  /home/chris/projects/MyPackage-CLI/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.0.2/MyPackage-CLI-0.1.0.0/x/MyPackage-CLI/build/MyPackage-CLI/MyPackage-CLI 
 That is a mouthful lol! I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter until I need to deploy (thanks to cabal run) but I am curious to know if I can just have a ~/projects/MyPackage-CLI/bin/MyPackage-CLI -- or something like that. 
 Any ideas? I&#x27;ve searched around and mostly I&#x27;ve found ways of changing cabal itself, not the output or bin directory. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>how would you guys define a function to sort this list [&quot;2x^2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;4x&quot;, &quot;-4y&quot;, &quot;3x^2&quot;, &quot;5z&quot;]?The result its supposed to be [&quot;3x^2&quot;, &quot;2x^2&quot;, &quot;4x&quot;, &quot;-4y&quot;, &quot;5z&quot;, &quot;2&quot;]
 e.g. [&quot;2x^2&quot;, &quot;3x^2&quot;, &quot;4x&quot;, &quot;-4y&quot;, &quot;4x^2&quot;, &quot;4y&quot;]
 result: [&quot;2x^2&quot;, &quot;3x^2&quot;, &quot;4x^2&quot;, &quot;4x&quot;, &quot;-4y&quot;, &quot;4y&quot;]
 Here the order between 2x^2, 3x^2 and 4x^2 is irrelevant, they just need to be together as x^2 is the same variable with the same degree

 What&#x27;s the accepted simple route to package management, build and so forth? I&#x27;m bewildered by ghcup, cabal, stack. Any pointers for use on noddy learning projects much appreciated.

                              <span>This past month I&#x27;ve been working on implementing my first OOP language with Haskell .. implementing the syntax and context analysis was very easy for me because I&#x27;m very aware of the fact that we build parsers using stateful monads using one of the already available libraries (like parsec for example)... so that went easy after defining the context-free grammars that is not left-recursive, and then implementing the parsec-functions to every non-terminating symbol in the grammars... so that went easy with no hiccups... 
 But after I dived into the context analysis that&#x27;s where shit hit the fan.. it seemed that my programming model has either been very bad or I&#x27;m a bad software-engineer because functions started to become very ugly due to many parameters that are passed to the functions, and many other reasons that I don&#x27;t how to start to explain, but in summary whatever makes haskell beautiful I managed to make it very ugly and complicated with my architecture design..
 So my question is: we already have stateful monads and parsers like parsec as an architectural model to implement the syntax analysis and context analysis. Are there also standardized models to implement the other steps in compilers like the context analysis? Is there literature that answers this question in regard to Haskell?
 Edit: while implementing the context analysis I became very aware of the fact that need zippers because I needed to be very aware ot the context of every variable and method which then I did and made the job much easier, so maybe that&#x27;s part of the answer that I&#x27;m seeking?

I&#x27;m using a current build of emacs 29.0.50 on X (with StumpWM/XMonad and picom), it has cairo, built with gtk3, regular alpha works... but no change when setting alpha-background.
 Can anyone confirm this works for them on X with picom? I&#x27;ve heard it working on Wayland with Sway, and of the emacs fork that had this code initially on X, but what about on the current version of emacs with X?

                              <span>Guys, I&#x27;m migrating from Vim to Emacs and my init.el is still very basic. I&#x27;ve installed evil, evil-collection and which-key. Overall, things are working pretty well, but I&#x27;m having trouble when using *Buffer List* (you know, the buffer menu invoked with C-x C-b or :ls).
 When I use C-h k o, for example, it shows the proper mapping defined in evil-collection: o is mapped to tabulated-list-sort.
 However, if I use C-h m, it says o is &quot;Select that buffer in another window&quot;. And when I invoke which-key-show-mode, is says o is mapped to Buffer-menu-other-window.
 Am I missing something here? Is there a package that &quot;glues&quot; all the help systems together?

 Consumption of social media typically necessitates few repeated actions - like, share, comment and follow. If these actions are assigned to convenient keyboard keys, the consumption becomes easier. Here&#x27;s an attempt to unify this experience using GNU Emacs and tumblesocks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve search for this issue but couldn&#x27;t find anything that solved it. Sorry if I missed something.
 I have all of the above installed --- and working. With Golang, the functions autocomplete with the parenthesis and placeholders for the args, as expected. So the plumbing works.
 But, when working with Javascript (with ts-ls), the functions and methods autocomplete without parenthesis or placeholders. So, for exemple, &quot;document.querySel&quot; autcompletes to &quot;document.querySelector&quot; -- NOT &quot;document.querySelector(selectors)&quot; or something like that.
 Again: yasnippet is installed and working and the entire thing works in other languages. Does anyone know why it doesn&#x27;t work with Javascript?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am a novice emacs user. In an attempt to set the font in my init.el file, I came across two different functions: set-fontset-font and set-frame-font.
 set-frame-font sets the font of current frame correctly, whereas set-fontset-font doesn&#x27;t do anything. To my understanding, invoking (set-fontset-font t ...) is basically modifying the default font set, making new frames to use the font I specified, so this behavior is surprising to me.
 I frequently fiddle with code that contains non-alphanumeric characters (Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, Emoji...), and I use different fonts for each of them. It would be great if I can use set-fontset-font as that function has this feature built-in. Is there a way to make it a one-function-to-rule-them-all?
 P.S. I tried modifying default-frame-alist with (font . &quot;fontset-default&quot;) but apparently that is not allowed? Now my init.el is broken!

 I barely understand linux (I only leared to use sed a week ago) but love it due to its customization options. 
 I only know basics of programming (upto functions and procedures) And can only write basic code in python. I have a love for programming but lack of motivation. 
 I use doom-emacs primarily because I like having everything in one software and as a IDE. 
 This is meant to be as much of a learning experience as it is motivation boost. 
 I cant come to a decison regarding any of this and have thus come here to ask the professionals

 I run Emacs on a Mac. I install it via homebrew. I install packages with straight-use-package. INFOPATH isn&#x27;t defined in my environment.
 When I enter Info in the usual way (C-h i) what I see is not optimal.
  
There is no entry for Emacs Lisp, among others.
 There are things for which there is no actual Info help. Example: &quot;Info-find-file: Info file ‘ada-mode’ does not exist; consider installing it&quot;
 There are almost 350 lines in the top level of Info and it is full of things I don&#x27;t care about, such as EUDC, &#x27;Gawk work flow&#x27;, and 22 separate entries for things in GNU Gettext Utilities.
  
Info-directory-list looks like this (where  actually represents my correct home directory)

 val x &#x3D; 10 if x &lt; 0 then println(&quot;negative&quot;) else if x &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 then println(&quot;zero&quot;) else println(&quot;positive&quot;) 
 I get this error:
 /Users/myname/Desktop/miscellaneous/courses/functional_programming_principles/scala-project/src/main/scala/example/example.worksheet.sc:3:4 &#x27;(&#x27; expected but identifier found. if x &lt; 0 then 
 When I run scala --version in my terminal I get Welcome to Scala 3.2.0 (11.0.16.1, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM) and my REPL also works in Scala 3. 
 I&#x27;m sure this is related but I&#x27;m not sure how to fix it:
  
In IDEA, under External Libraries, OpenJDK 18 and Scala SDK 2.13.10 are listed.
  
Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks
 EDIT: I fixed the issue by simply starting a new project and following the IDEA new project wizard. Helped me select the JDK and Scala version that I wanted. Thanks!

                              <span>I am using Doom emacs, with Evil mode.
 I am learning using Org Mode and I wanted to cycle through single Headlines by using the Tab key but what I can only cycle through is the first level under the Headline I am pressing the Tab key upon.
 To clarify, I don&#x27;t want to use the S-Tab to cycle through all Headlines, but I only want to cycle through one Headline and its sub-headlines.
 How can I cycle through all nested Headlines, one by one, with evil mode
 I am sorry if that&#x27;s a pretty noob question. Thank you all for your help
 Edit: I&#x27;ve found in the manual a workaround (which is actually the official combo key for the action I was looking for) by using C-c C-k. That key combo will expand all subtrees of a headline, recursively. To close the main headline back, I&#x27;ll use za.
 Sadly, default vim z operations in evil-org look not working. E.G. zO is supposed to perform the operation I was looking for, or zr doesn&#x27;t open one subtree at a time.
 Edit 2: In the lang: org README file from Doom Emacs I see that this behavior was intentional and that can be reversed.
  
 TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree, rather than cycle through it recursively. This can be reversed with:  #+begin_src emacs-lisp (after! evil-org (remove-hook &#x27;org-tab-first-hook #&#x27;+org-cycle-only-current-subtree-h)) #+end_src

                              <span>I love orgmode, have been using it for years at this point throughout my undergraduate years and for most personal projects.
 However, I&#x27;ve been more involved with working closely with other developers. How do you guys manage using orgmode alongside other project management platforms like Trello, Monday.com, Notion, Jira, etc? It&#x27;s really hard having to check for tickets or items assigned to me on those platforms and then updating them manually on orgmode.
 Are my days of using orgmode over or relegated to just personal projects?

Sometimes I feel the need to think outside the box. Is it possible from within a box?
Questions:
What are your preferred places for thinking?
If your are outside, do you think inside the box?
If you get paid for thinking, where did you earn your money? Inside or outside?</span>

 TL;DR: There are some cool libraries out there but setting all the tooling up for them is not straightforward, so I decided to stick with vanilla records for now.
 Would love to hear if I&#x27;ve missed anything or got anything wrong!

                              <span>The &quot;snapshot&quot; binaries of Emacs 29 for Windows posted today should be somewhat less fragile while running without GCC/libgccjit (e.g. MSYS2 installed and on the Windows path).
 https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-29/?C&#x3D;M;O&#x3D;D
 Note: the snapshot is dated Oct 13, 2022, but I posted it today, Oct 15th; took me a few days. The last included commit was cbd04ad3d572850775f18bde868c71abcde733ed.
 Anyway, this build use a new &quot;trampolines&quot; target for make. This target pre-compiles (AOT) trampolines, infrastructure that allows natively compiled elisp to call redefined elisp primitives, which are then included with the installer, zip and no-deps.zip distributables. While redefining primitives is discouraged, it does happen, especially via advice APIs.
 Including these trampolines should enable installing and running (e.g.) packages that advise elisp primitives. Previously (in all 29 snapshots and GNU windows binary distributions of Emacs 28) that might have failed because Emacs unconditionally creates trampolines on the fly if they do not exist when needed. Precompiling the trampolines should prevent Emacs from triggering async native compilation even when native-comp-available-p was returning nil, to make them.
 TIA for bug reports &amp; feedback!
 PS, in case others are building Emacs with native comp enabled and not distributing GCC/libgcc with, the new make target isn&#x27;t on the Emacs 28 branch (yet). It should be fairly easy to patch it in or manually add something like this to your packaging process after success of make all, before make install (or make install-strip or whtv)
  (mapatoms (λ (f) (when (subr-primitive-p (symbol-function f)) (or (comp-trampoline-search f) (comp-trampoline-compile f))))) 
 This code comes from message #50 in bug #58318, and worked for me (however, the 29 snapshot binaries do use the new make target, now - they don&#x27;t use the above snippet).
 Edit: un-mangled the code block

                              <span>I&#x27;m under impression that subfolders are discouraged in org-mode - I can&#x27;t refile capture notes into a subfolder without explicitly adding it to org-directory. Same with org-agenda. Anything in, for example &quot;work&quot; folder won&#x27;t be listed until specifically added to org-agenda-files. Which means that renaming one folder now needs to be also changed in 2+ places.
 Is there a &quot;philosophy&quot; behind that? Is it documented anywhere? I found these blog posts, but I&#x27;d really like to see some developers saying that &quot;subfolders are considered harmful&quot;:
 https://karl-voit.at/2020/01/25/avoid-complex-folder-hierarchies/
 https://karl-voit.at/2020/05/03/current-org-files/
 Why not searching these directories recursively?
 Or how to work with org mode files outside of org-directory?

                              <span>I have corfu start suggesting completion candidates after I type 3 characters, and one feature I want is for candidates to include symbols or words that contain (rather than just start with) the 3 characters I typed. This is because it’s often hard to know whether the word or symbol I’m searching for is a substring of the word or symbol (especially in a coding environment).
 I’m especially wanting this functionality for completions for dabbrev and lisp symbols. I’m new to completion-at-point-functions, so I was hoping to get some help from the community. Thank you!

                              <span>After a bit of experimenting I finally got diary-mail-entries to actually mail me diary entries.
 My problem now is with midnight-mode.
 I copied what I found in the EmacsWiki into my init file, changing calendar to diary-mail-entries:
 (require &#x27;midnight)
 (midnight-delay-set &#x27;midnight-delay &quot;4:30am&quot;)
 (add-hook &#x27;midnight-hook &#x27;diary-mail-entries)
 My problem is, not only do I get email at 4:30am but each and every time I start emacs.
 If anyone knows what I may be doing wrong or how to correct this I would appreciate it.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 When I use control +/- I can only zoom in up to the font size I set in ~/.doom.d/config.el (doom user here) then it just says &quot;The font hasn&#x27;t been resized&quot; (not big of an explanation).
 I zoom out and on the right bottom corner it tells me how many &quot;steps&quot; I zoomed back ( (-1), (-2), etc.), and when I press C-+ even just one time it takes me back to &quot;0&quot; ie the default font size I set.
 This what I have in my config regarding fonts.
 ;; ----------- FONTS ----------- ;; main font stuff (setq doom-font (font-spec :family &quot;Comic Mono&quot; :size 24) doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family &quot;Ubuntu&quot; :size 24) doom-big-font (font-spec :family &quot;Comic Mono&quot; :size 24)) ;; make italics and bold show without the slash and asterisk (not working) (after! doom-themes (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t doom-themes-enable-italic t)) ;; italic comments and keywords (not working) (custom-set-faces! &#x27;(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic) &#x27;(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic)) 
 I&#x27;m sorry if the question is high noobeness, I&#x27;m not very practical with this and I don&#x27;t have any idea of how to move forward. I love editing org files in emacs though, so these headaches are worth it.
 Thank you all.

                              <span>At random points during the day I see the following error message: 
 file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void 
 Unfortunately, I cannot figure out what the source of this is. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things, including
 (setq debug-on-message &quot;file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void&quot;) 
 and setting debug-on-error to t. But I keep getting these messages (overnight, the message popped up about 29 times, according to the messages buffer) with no explanation. 
 Any suggestions on what else I can try here?
 EDIT: I realized I failed to add the last bit of the message. It actually reads: 
 file-notify--call-handler: Symbol’s function definition is void: nil

                              <span>I&#x27;m under impression that subfolders are discouraged in org-mode - I can&#x27;t refile capture notes into a subfolder without explicitly adding it to org-directory. Same with org-agenda. Anything in, for example &quot;work&quot; folder won&#x27;t be listed until specifically added to org-agenda-files. Which means that renaming one folder now needs to be also changed in 2+ places.
 Is there a &quot;philosophy&quot; behind that? Is it documented anywhere? I found this blog post, but I&#x27;d really like to see some developers saying that &quot;subfolders are considered harmful&quot;:

 Why not searching these directories recursively?

                              <span>Is there a way to mention and keep track of people similar to how Notion supports it but with org-mode? Here is my wish-list:
  
Start typing @ and get an auto-complete helm box with all the people I have in the system. Selecting one would should the nickname I defined for them in this sytem
 Have a capture template (for example when creating a meeting) where I can select the people I have in the system (multi-select) and assign them to a &quot;with&quot; property under the meeting heading
 Click on a @-link and see all the headings under which this person is mentioned.
 Assign a TODO to someone and later see all the TODOs by them (today I do this with tags but it doesn&#x27;t work well with people with the same first names unless my tags keep a @first_lastname pattern for everyone) Closest I have seen so far is this: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/64502 but it&#x27;s part of a much more complex package which seems overkill. Plus, I don&#x27;t see how I could easily use with a capture template.
  
Any ideas? Thanks!

One of the greatest difficulties in understanding the Zettelkasten Method is to separate its specific characteristics from actual knowledge work. Or, how I like to phrase it: “Link knowledge, not notes.” Working with our Zettelkasten is the physical (or digital) manifestation of our thinking. It provides a framework that allows us to think through writing and to create an increasingly complex thinking machine that can help us think deeper than being on our own. The Zettelkasten Method provides a framework for our thinking, but does not prescribe what and how we think.

I am in the processing to formalise some of my outlining methods into teachable tools and decided to tinker with dedicated outlining software. Bike and the OmniOutliner are my top candidates at the moment.
Perhaps, it is because I started to experiment with Bike and am yet more familiar with it as opposed to OmniOutliner. But I am really pleased with its feel and nimbleness.</span>

                              <span>My question is how would you solve the problem that if a project is organised package-by-feature (https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/rb1n7e/package_by_feature_not_by_layer/) and you want to import one domain POJO into another project you&#x27;re bringing in all the heavy dependencies that this project has, to database library, HTTP server library, API definition library, JSON serialiser library etc.
 If core domain object is near service and repository then that module must include the dependency to the SQL or other database library. Now if your other project doesn&#x27;t use SQL but they need your core object it will drag all the libraries with it.
 If you separate out the core domain class into a submodule that doesn&#x27;t contain any dependencies, then you can import that to other projects, but then it&#x27;s suddenly not package-by-feature. Or can we achieve a hybrid model where the core object is separate and then all the rest, SQL, HTTP, API, JSON are in one other module that is the app.

                              <span>I was trying to get my code cleaner. When I said everything is right and I made it, I built and get the type mismatch error. I am erasing the classified info.
 type mismatch; found : cmd.Persist (which expands to) XXXXEntity#Persist required: XXXXEntity.this.Persist .onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) &#x3D;&gt; cmd.apply(ctx, state) } 
 ​
 I created A Command interface and created Commands from it.
 trait XXXXCommands[R] extends ReplyType[R] { override type ReplyType &#x3D; Rtype Context &#x3D; XXXXEntity#CommandContext[ReplyType]type State &#x3D;XXXXStatetype Persist &#x3D; XXXXEntity#Persist def apply(ctx: Context, stateOpt: Option[State]): Persist &#x3D; {stateOpt match {case None &#x3D;&gt; initial(ctx)case Some(state) if state.XXXXStatus &#x3D;&#x3D; XXXXStatus.Success &#x3D;&gt; success(ctx, state)}} protected def rejectByStatus(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist &#x3D; {ctx.invalidCommand(s&quot;${this.getClass.getSimpleName}: Invalid operation. {Id: ${state.XXXXId}, Status: ${state.XXXXStatus}&quot;)ctx.done} protected def reject(message: String, ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persist &#x3D; {ctx.invalidCommand(message)ctx.done} protected def initial(ctx: Context): XXXXEntity#Persistprotected def success(ctx: Context, state: State): XXXXEntity#Persist} 
 I am using (or trying to use) Lagom framework. Persist is a trait that is inside of the PersistentEntity trait. Because of the the inner traits I tried to take the Persist inside the Entity that I created via hash (#) operation. That may be the problem.
 I dont know how could I fix it but its so weird to have that problem. This would exactly work in java but why it did not in scala?
 Edit:
 It happens when I try to run the code below.
 override def behavior: Behavior &#x3D; Actions().onCommand[XXXXCommand, XXXXCreatedReply] { case (cmd: XXXXCommand, ctx, state) &#x3D;&gt; cmd.apply(ctx, state) }

                              <span>Hey, I just attended a job‍ that was largely JVM-focused. I&#x27;m not new to the JVM; I&#x27;ve done previous work in Java (1.6/Android) and spent a large chunk of time writing Clojure. My previous work has been in Haskell, which I liked. I guess my question is: Is Scala worth it now? I have a larger Java codebase I&#x27;ll be integrating with, and I get to choose what JVM technologies to use, and other folks have expressed interest in Scala as well. I&#x27;d feel guilty for pushing Clojure on them, just because I know it, but I&#x27;ve also been there and done that, and I like types now. Coming from Haskell, are there functional libraries I should build upon but allow for escape hatch style mutability for some of my not so functional teammates? We&#x27;re a small team, and pedagogy will be a part of the gig. I&#x27;m looking for honest opinions of the language and what essential reading material/libraries would be for someone more comfortable with FP in general. I&#x27;m not opposed to pragmatism either; it&#x27;s one thing I like about Scala. It seems like there&#x27;s a lot of excellent libraries because of the existing JVM ecosystem. Thanks!

                              <span>I’m super excited about new meta programming capabilities. Macros, match types, inline methods etc. All of them are super useful in the project I’m working on - CRUD with lots of lookalike entities and logic. 
 I’m very efficient in Scala 2, good old runtime-programming and FP, but macro always felt like something not to touch in Scala 2.
 Now there’s Scala 3, and metaprogramming seems to go mainstream. The problem though is that I cannot get used to programming at compile-time. Everything I have in my project is someone else’s copypasta. I’ve read the docs and few blogposts, but still not capable to write it myself. 
 I’m looking for small Scala 3 exclusive (mixing it with 2 makes much harder to distinguish) projects with use of metaprogramming where I can learn more and perhaps contribute. Ducktape (https://github.com/arainko/ducktape) is a great example. Any blog posts would be even better. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a weird issue where some fonts don&#x27;t display some characters in some contexts. In this example, I have show-paren-mode enabled, and highlighted parentheses are not displaying.
 In fact, this only affects the font Iosevka as far as I can tell.
 Does anyone have any idea what&#x27;s going on?

 We have 2FA enabled so I&#x27;ve been using an app password to access. Suddenly offlineimap gives me this error:
  PLAIN authentication failed: b&#x27;AUTHENTICATE failed.&#x27; LOGIN authentication failed: b&#x27;LOGIN failed.&#x27; 
 I tried creating a new app password for my account and updating my authinfo file, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference. Anyone have any advice?

I want features similar to vscode such as class definition, jumping into class code and suggestions/help for code completion. Many thanks.

                              <span>I found that completing-read + embark-act-all rocks. For example, I can update all lsp-related package in straight.el by calling straight-pull-package and then type lsp- to get a list of completion candidates with lsp in the name. Then I call embark-act-all and pull all the selected packages.
 But it would be useful to be able to switch from an arbitrary completing-read minibuffer into completing-read-multiple via a key-press, collect multiple candidates (which don&#x27;t necessarily have matching substrings), and then just run the original command for each of the selected candidates, e.g. via embark-act-all. This would be much more convenient than just running the command multiple times or what I sometimes do, mapping the function over the list in elisp (M-: (seq-map #&#x27; candidates))
 I could write my own function which calls completing-read-multiple, like straight-pull-package-crm, but it would be nice if something like that would be possible from any command. I&#x27;m asking because I thought something like that should already exist somewhere or be possible somehow with existing functionality in emacs/embark.
 Feel free to propose other solutions to my problem, as what I&#x27;m asking might be an XY problem.

 Would there be any established way of hiding the timecode information yet still working with the text? 
 That would allow me to take that timecode info, link it up to an XML and have it do the first step of the video editing process for me (though I&#x27;ll probably also have some challenges setting that up lol)

 I suppose I&#x27;ll have to actually give the particular example that has most recently frustrated me:

                              <span>Hello, I want to write a simple converter from lambda calculus expressions to SKI expressions using these 6 rules. I have my two types
 data Expr &#x3D; Var String | Abs String Expr | App Expr Expr data SKI &#x3D; S | K | I | App SKI SKI 
 With these types, rule 5 does not quite work using general recursion:
 general :: Expr -&gt; SKI general (Abs v1 (Abs v2 e)) | free v1 e &#x3D; general (Abs v1 $ general (Abs v2 e)) 
 Understandably, this doesn&#x27;t work because Abs requires its second arg to be an Expr but general returns SKI.
 I&#x27;ve tried implementing it using various recursion schemes (futu, histo, para and ana), but to no success. Is there a way to do this without having to merge the two types together into one?
 And additionally, if something can&#x27;t be implemented using general recursion, can it be implemented using recursion schemes? Or is general recursion strictly &quot;more powerful&quot;?

                              <span>To me, I&#x27;ve always thought that data constructors should have a lowercase first letter, because they are term-level and behave very similarly to functions. For example,
 data T &#x3D; D Int f :: Int -&gt; T f &#x3D; D 
 Here, f and D are very similar conceptually, so why should they be represented differently?
 I&#x27;ve read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237775/why-does-haskell-force-data-constructors-first-letter-to-be-upper-case but the only compelling argument to me seems to be pattern matching, since data constructors can be matched on but functions cannot. However as someone who learnt haskell recently it seems to me that it would be clearer if data constructors had a lower case first letter to make clear their term-levelness.

 Are there any options for paid training that include mentorship and career guidance? It’s important for me to emerge with industry connections and/or help with job placement.
 Thanks for your advice in advance.

In the coming weeks I&#x27;m considering releasing my hyper-minimal take on Zettelkasten to a wider audience. My rationale has always been to squash complexity in favor of a quick &amp; lightweight method of retrieving notes (nothing at all wrong with other apps that have all the bells &amp; whistles btw). The same codebase runs on any of Windows, Linux, BSD (Apple likely to be included soon as well) with zero issues.
Some screen shots...



The interface as you noticed is commandline driven &amp; features a REPL (Read Evaluate Print &amp; Loop) to process commands. As it stands now, the source code is merely 27 Kilobytes in size &amp; would be great to toss on a USB drive so your notes are easy to access. No smartphone interface as I&#x27;m not much interested in that domain. At any rate, if this sounds like something you might be interested in, check in every now &amp; again &amp; I&#x27;ll hopefully post a download link eventually.</span>

                              <span>I followed the official documentation to get babel setup with GNU octave. Though when I try to run the code,
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +BEGIN_SRC octave :results value
 function g &#x3D; f(x) g &#x3D; x; endfunction quad(&#x27;f&#x27;,0,3)
 +END_SRC
  I get the error,  warning: function name &#x27;f&#x27; does not agree with function filename &#x27;&#x27; warning: inline is obsolete; use anonymous functions instead error: quad: evaluation of user-supplied function failed error: called from feval&gt;@ at line 1 column 6 feval at line 34 column 10 subsref at line 44 column 14
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But running that same code in its own script, I get a proper answer. Anyone have any idea what I&#x27;m messing up here? Here is a link to the official babel documentation, https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-octave.html.
 When I run something that doesn&#x27;t require a function, I get a working output just fine.

                              <span>On a previous post, we explained how to write tests for
stateful systems using traces — sequences of stateful actions — that can be
combined and modified to write complex test cases easily and transparently. This
post elaborates on the combinators used to generate new traces from previously
existing traces.
Writing generators for property-based tests is an art, and there’s often a
trade-off between how many test cases are generated and how meaningful each of
them is. When considering stateful systems, this problem is exacerbated, because
any action taken now may constrain the available actions for the future. This
means that the test generator will already need to track how the state evolves
from each step to the next in order to generate valid inputs. We think that
this is problematic bec…</span>

                              <span>Hey all, I recently posted about getting vuiet set up in my emacs. After getting it working completely, I have an issue that I think is specific to Spacemacs... Vuiet is supposed to show playing track information on the modeline - right about where you’d normally have line/char line counts. Mine very rarely does this; I haven’t exactly pinned it down, but SOME buffers will actually show this information. It doesn’t seem to be vuiet-specific ones exactly, but I think that might be it. 
 I’d really appreciate any suggestions for where I could look to pull that info out of vuiet and add it to my modeline. 
 I tried placing (vuiet-update-mode-line) in the modeline config variable (forget the exact name) but that didn’t help. 
 Sometimes when I run the command manually I can actually see it for what looks like a frame or two.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t find much information on it.
 I have javascript and/or typescript files that have html in them. This is pretty common now, using tagged templates to make html.
 let header &#x3D; (title) &#x3D;&gt; html&#x60;
${title}
&#x60;; 
 I had this working, kind of, with mmm mode a long time ago. That was before tree-sitter and lsp.

                              <span>Hello everyone, this should be particularly interesting if you want to use (or keep using) a browser within Emacs, run Emacs in MacOS, are knowledgeable on Emacs&#x27; C code, or any of the above.
 I&#x27;ve been using xwidget-webkit in Emacs for a while now, thanks to d12frosted&#x27;s great Emacs Plus Homebrew formulae which include it as a build option. If you don&#x27;t know, this feature allows you to run an instance of a browser from within an Emacs buffer (if you run MacOS, the browser is Safari, though this might be configurable -- I&#x27;m not sure). I find it a great and useful feature when browsing code-documentation online or using search engines for quick questions.
 Recently I&#x27;ve noticed a few bugs, especially after switching to Emacs 29 (pixel-scroll-precision is great!).
 I&#x27;ve opened this issue wit…</span>

Usually, I run emacs into Terminator : Works well, but copy/paste is kinda glitchy. When I run shell into emacs, the shell is really glitchy. Is there a way to make this works better without toooo much work around? Love emacs btw

                              <span>TL;DR: I need to specify a :files value inside the use-package form, but this has irritating side-effects.
 I install packages with straight and use-package.
 I use the transient package. I noticed that its info manual didn&#x27;t appear for me with C-h i. I dug deeper and realized that .../straight/build/transient didn&#x27;t contain a dir file or any of the doc files. Several other packages, like orderless, did include dir in their straight/build directories, but their repo directories also happen to store the doc files at the top level.
 transient is different in that its repo has a docs/ subdirectory, which seemed to be the source of the problem. But magit has a similar repo structure, and its docs were installing fine.
 I noticed that the recipe for magit has a :files key which pulls in the doc file. Adding
 :straight (:files (:defaults &quot;docs/*&quot;)) 
 to my (use-package &#x27;transient ...) form appears to do the trick - and automagically triggers a make docs command for transient somehow - but now I have two wrinkles:
  
straight rebuilds transient every time I start Emacs
 I get a warning &quot;Warning (straight): Two different recipes given for &quot;transient&quot; (:files cannot be both nil and (:defaults &quot;docs/*&quot;))&quot;
  
The first issue is annoying, but isn&#x27;t a showstopper. I don&#x27;t restart Emacs very often and my startup time is already slow.
 The second issue worries me, because I don&#x27;t know whether it means that updated docs will actually get installed in the future. Presumably the clash is between my (use-package &#x27;transient ...) and the recipe that gets used when transient is handled as a dependency of magit (which I also use). But which recipe is actually used to install transient now? Is it getting installed twice every time?
 I don&#x27;t know why the transient docs aren&#x27;t getting installed &quot;out of the box&quot; as they apparently are for everyone else. What might I be doing wrong?

 I&#x27;m having trouble finding how to solve this problem. What I want is for src blocks to respect the indentation of the language. However, it does not get indented correctly. Below is a video that shows this:

 Is there some other mode that can detect them and print them?
 After checking the Doom issue log I see that command-log-mode has been replaced with view-lossage which does something similar, but just like command-long-mode it doesn&#x27;t produce any output for the home and end keys.
 This the another mode or command that can detect and print out the home and end keys?

                              <span>Hi, as it seems EGlot will receive the blessing of inclusion into vanilla Emacs. That makes me wonder how I am supposed to use dap-mode at it swaps in lsp-mode as a dependency.
 Can I use Eglot AND dap-mode side-by-side? If yes, how? Or is the separation of dap-mode from lsp-mode something the developers of https://github.com/emacs-lsp should address?

                              <span>I must be getting old. I&#x27;ve been trying to configure my init.el for org and org-roam, and I&#x27;ve gotten to where emacs starts without any error, I can open org-mode and I can open org-roam-mode. Then I&#x27;m stuck. Well, I did find that in org I can hit C-x C-f and open a *.org file and enter outline stuff, and save it, but I&#x27;m baffled by org-roam. Let&#x27;s say I found some interesting ideas in the comment section of a blog in my browser. I assume that to record the note (zettel) I need to start emacs and get into org-roam-mode. What do I do then? I mean, what keys to I press to open a new note? How do I specify the type of note (main or reference, I&#x27;m starting out small)? Is there a tutorial anywhere that gives this kind of instruction for org-roam or zettelkasten?

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m currently moving my time tracking to org-mode after already using it for a few years.
 So far I&#x27;ve managed ok to transition/integrate org-mode in my caldav workflow.
 I found few problems that I have questions on:
  
I&#x27;ve used timestamps such as the one below in some entries however they don&#x27;t seem to appear in my agenda buffer:  Is there anything that I need to do so that entries using those appear in my agenda?
 I&#x27;ve then tried to use something like &#x60; that works however if I include -1d to get a notification a day before they agenda doesn&#x27;t show it for some reason.
 How does org-mode deal with timezones? I get some calendar invites that contain different timezones.

                              <span>So let&#x27;s say I have a library and a test-suite and my Cabal file looks something like this: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;cabal library exposed-modules: MyLib build-depends: base &gt;&#x3D;4.14.3.0 hs-source-dirs: src default-language: Haskell2010
 test-suite test type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: Test.hs build-depends: base &gt;&#x3D;4.14.3.0 , my-lib hs-source-dirs: test default-language: Haskell2010 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I want to test a &quot;private&quot; function from MyLib. The function is not supposed to be exported by the module. But of course then I can&#x27;t import the function from my test suite. What&#x27;s the standard way to deal with this? 
  
Put the tests together with MyLib and export the tests? 
 Make a dedicated module just to re-export the &quot;public&quot; functions and for all other modules just export everything? 
 Never test private functions?
  
All of these options seem flawed to me.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m one of the consensus team members at IOG. We maintain and extend the consensus layer of the Cardano blockchain, which provides a rich set of challenges related to distributed computing, type level programming, networking, concurrency, among others.
 We&#x27;re a team of 3 IOG developers, and 4 external colleagues. I think we managed to build a very nice group of capable engineers, and we&#x27;re looking to strengthen our IOG team.
 For this role we&#x27;re looking for a very experienced senior software engineer that is:
 - A nice person above all.
 - Able to understand the research material we have to implement (eg Ouroboros papers).
 - Able to work on high-level design.
 - Proactive. 
 - Pragmatic and capable of getting things done.
 - A good mentor for other team members
 - Good at communicating with other stakeholders (eg other teams, project managers, C-suite, etc).
 - Has experience working remotely.
 For more info on this role please check this link, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

 This is what I observe: The tests in general run fine, until I enable the one defined here: https://github.com/thomasbach-dev/hs-rrd/blob/context-bindings/test/RRDTool/LowLevelSpec.hs#L41 which calls rrd_get_context. The tests simply crash then:
 $ cabal test --test-show-details&#x3D;always Running 1 test suites... Test suite hs-rrd-test: RUNNING... Test suite hs-rrd-test: FAIL 
 Started in a repl I get the following:
 ghci&gt; :add *RRDTool.LowLevel Ok, two modules loaded. ghci&gt; rrd_get_context cabal: repl failed for hs-rrd-0.1.0.0. The build process segfaulted (i.e. SIGSEGV). 
 The code of rrd_get_context can be found here: https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_thread_safe.c#L43 It basically does some calls to pthread.
 Can someone help on what to do next?
 EDIT: I looked into this a bit deeper. The problem actually does not seem to be the calls to pthread, but the way I read the rrd_context_t in Haskell (i.e. the peek). I changed my test to simply call the raw functions in C and look at the returned pointer address. That works ok and I do not get a null pointer. So I guess it has to be the peek which triggers the segmentation fault.
 This also happens when I simply call rrd_new_context which according to the C code ( https://github.com/oetiker/rrdtool-1.x/blob/2db8afce06e64f86133fae21b7b6b730df540293/src/rrd_error.c#L121) only does a malloc and then returns the pointer.
 So either the memory pointed to is already taken away from my process (not sure what the proper wording is here) or my Storable instance is broken.

I&#x27;d like to write something in Akka using actors and some beginner-friendly project to learn IO (ZIO, cats or monix). I had a contact with akka earlier and I wrote small projects that are not suitable for a resume, but it will be my beginning with the IO

                              <span>Hi! I’m pretty new to scala and the usage of underscore to simplify lambdas seems a little obscure to me. For example I can write this:
  readLine.split(&quot; &quot;).map(_.toInt)  And it works as expected, but then I try:  vertices(v).filter(!(visited(_))  and the compiler would complain:
  
value unary_! is not a member of Int &#x3D;&gt; Boolean
  
So I end up writing my lambda expressions with _ and if I see an error then I expand them to “true” lambdas like:  vertices(v).filter(vertex &#x3D;&gt; !(visited(vertex)) 
 This is a little frustrating, so what I want to know, is, what are the rules that the underscore syntax OK in the first case, but wrong in the second one?

I just can&#x27;t seem to be told a good reason on why you want to set a variable and not be able to reassign it when needed to. why continuously create new vals?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I wrote this simple 2048 solver in Haskell as a way to exercise the language:
 https://github.com/gdelazzari/2048Solver
 It&#x27;s one of the first working pieces of Haskell code I was able to write, and I&#x27;m sure it is written very naively. Keeping aside the obvious performance issues (which I&#x27;m not actually interested in solving at the moment), do you think there are ways I could improve it in terms of readability, program structure and use of the language features?
 Thanks!

 [(2,0),(4,5),(3,10)] 
 Notice each pair is a (value, index) 
 I would want:
 [2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3] 
 so far I have:
 ​
 insert :: [(Int,Int)] -&gt; Int -&gt; [Int]
 insert [] _ &#x3D; []
 insert ((x, y):xs) t
 | t &#x3D;&#x3D; y &#x3D; x : (insert (xs) (t + 1))
 | otherwise &#x3D; 0 : insert ([(x,y)]) (t + 1)
 ​
 and I am only getting
 [2,0,0,0,0,0,4] 
 any help would be appreciated

                              <span>Consider the following megaparsec parsers:  ab &#x3D; string &quot;a&quot; &gt;&gt; string &quot;b&quot; ac &#x3D; string &quot;ac&quot;  I want to parse them consequently, maybe adding some modifier two the first one (??? ab &gt;&gt; ac) to achieve the following behavior:
  
ab should be optional
 if both parsers fail, expectations of both parsers should be shown (or, at least the first one)
  
I&#x27;ve tried the following:
  
optional ab &gt;&gt; ac
 try (optional ab) &gt;&gt; ac
 optional (try ab) &gt;&gt; ac
  
The first, as expected, is not able to parse &quot;ac&quot;, the second behaves identically to the first. The third is much better, but it doesn&#x27;t satisfy the second condition: for input &quot;az&quot; it returns &quot;expecting &#x27;ac&#x27;&quot;, but not &quot;expecting &#x27;ab&#x27; or &#x27;ac&#x27;&quot;. It&#x27;s interesting, that if the first symbol doesn&#x27;t match (for example, for &quot;z&quot;), the desired behavior is achieved. However, this is not enough in my case. How can I do this?
 This is my test code: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; parsers :: [Parser String] parsers &#x3D; [ optional ab &gt;&gt; ac , try (optional ab) &gt;&gt; ac , optional (try ab) &gt;&gt; ac ] where ab &#x3D; string &quot;a&quot; &gt;&gt; string &quot;b&quot; ac &#x3D; string &quot;ac&quot;
 strs :: [String] strs &#x3D; [&quot;abac&quot;, &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;az&quot;]
 test :: IO () test &#x3D; for_ (parsers zip [1 ..]) $ (p, i) -&gt; do putStrLn $ &quot;parser &quot;  show i  &quot;:&quot; for_ strs $ \str -&gt; do putStrLn $ &quot;string &quot; show str  &quot;:&quot; parseTest p str &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 P.S. I&#x27;ve tried to write my one combinator for this issue, using observing or setState/getState, but have not achieved anything.

                              <span>Usually, one doesn&#x27;t encounter new simple monads in the wild, they&#x27;re nearly all combinations of existing transformers. But I don&#x27;t know of an existing transformer capturing this:
 data RandomT m a &#x3D; RandomT { getRandomT :: RandomSeed -&gt; m a } split :: RandomSeed -&gt; (RandomSeed, RandomSeed) instance Monad m &#x3D;&gt; Monad (RandomT m) where RandomT action &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; RandomT $ \seed -&gt; do let (seed&#x27;, seed&#x27;&#x27;) &#x3D; split seed a  (a, a) 
 While there are no nontrivial comonoids in Haskell, could there be nontrivial semigroups (although I&#x27;m not sure whether random seeds are an example because of coassociativity)? If not, do random monads implemented this way actually obey the associativity laws?
 Is this transformer implemented in general somewhere?

 Those counters would be live and would change depending on presses of C-s and C-r.
 I&#x27;d prefer counters instead of using avy and playing game of pressing assigned letter. You can very quickly press C-s or C-r given number of times without making a mistake.

                              <span>Hi,
 So I use both ef-themes and modus-themes by Prots as my themes, and I really like the fact that we can customize the org-mode headings by level.
 This is done with this configuration (from ef-themes manual)
 (setq ef-themes-headings ; read the manual&#x27;s entry or the doc string &#x27;((0 . (variable-pitch light 1.9)) (1 . (variable-pitch light 1.8)) (2 . (variable-pitch regular 1.7)) (3 . (variable-pitch regular 1.6)) (4 . (variable-pitch regular 1.5)) (5 . (variable-pitch 1.4)) ; absence of weight means &#x60;bold&#x27; (6 . (variable-pitch 1.3)) (7 . (variable-pitch 1.2)) (t . (variable-pitch 1.1)))) 
 As far as I understand, we can only configure 8 level, I thought that the last line would set the themes for every subsequent level, but this is not the case in my experience. When I create a ninth level heading, it goes back to the style of the first level.
 This make it weird and not really attractive with file with many levels of subheadings.
 ​
 I don&#x27;t know if we can overcome this limitation, if so I would be interested in knowing how.
 My second thought was to disable the theming in a specific buffer. But I wasn&#x27;t able to do it by making the variable local. Is there a way to do that ?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I just installed and configured org-super-agenda-mode.
 I&#x27;m using it inside org-agenda-custom-command
 Unfortunately this only works if I enable org-super-agenda mode manually after emacs started:
 M-x org-super-agenda-mode C-c a rd # to open my custom view 
 I really read the documentation telling me to us setq.
 Here&#x27;s my code: 
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;rd&quot; &quot;MyView&quot; ((agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-span 2) (org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;((:name &quot;Today&quot; :time-grid t :date today :todo &quot;TODAY&quot; :scheduled today :order 1) (:discard (:anything t)) )))) (alltodo &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;&quot;) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(deadline-up)) (org-super-agenda-groups &#x27;((:name &quot;Important&quot; :property &quot;urgent&quot; :order 1) (:name &quot;Überfällig&quot; :deadline past :order 2) (:name &quot;Heute fällig&quot; :deadline today :order 3) (:name &quot;Current Taks&quot; :todo (&quot;InProgress&quot; &quot;INPROGRESS&quot;) :order 4) (:name &quot;Next ToDos&quot; :todo (&quot;InputQueue&quot; &quot;INPUTQUEUE&quot;) :order 5) (:name &quot;Drafts&quot; :todo &quot;DRAFT&quot; :order 6) )))))) (&quot;inf&quot; &quot;InfAgenda&quot; tags &quot;filename&#x3D;{INFIT}&quot;( (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;notregexp &quot;\\* InProgress\\|\\* InputQueue\\|* Waiting\\|* DRAFT\\|* ToDo\\|* Backlog\\|* INPUTQUEUE\\|* INPROGRESS&quot;)) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(deadline-up)) (org-agenda-view-columns-initially t))) (&quot;w&quot; todo &quot;Waiting&quot;) (&quot;iq&quot; todo &quot;InputQueue&quot;) (&quot;ip&quot; todo &quot;InProgress&quot;) (&quot;d&quot; todo &quot;DRAFT&quot;) (&quot;y&quot; agenda*) )) 
 How can I get this to work automatically for the custom command &quot;rd&quot;.

                              <span>Dear All, I just got Emacs 28.1 installed on my work laptop. It&#x27;s a windows 10 machine administered by the IT. The Emacs install does not have access to the internet - howerver, other programs like Firefox do.
 I download packages manually and use use-package without :ensure to configure them. I managed to configure a very basic system with ivy, swiper, evil (+collection). The main goal is convenient org-mode use.
 Do you have any tips for such an offline situation? I admit its quite a chore to do all the config and package installation manually.

                              <span>Hey all! This post isn’t just about vuiet but this is my main issue right now. Using spacemacs on pop! OS I recently decided to start adding some extended features and working on my config. Eventually I managed to get lastfm.el and Vuiet working together and it’s awesome! I think I’ve figured out how to make a script with new keybinds for the Vuiet stuff I need to use, but some features are broken, namely searching songs by lyrics. I’m not sure how to debug emacs scripts so if anyone has any suggestions, including a better player, I’m open. Also, I’m shopping around for a completion module, mostly for Python but also C and HTML.
 Edit:
 Vuiet is cool, but seems like a lost cause. I think the only functionality EMMS doesn’t have that Vuiet did, though, is searching by artist for stuff I don’t actually have. 
 My main problem at this point is how to add an SMB share to EMMS.

                              <span>I want to be able to actively recall my notes and review them on a regular basis, and I haven’t figured out how to implement them in my notes.
 I read Doubleloop’s blog post on his workflow, but as he stated in the improvement section,
  
I feel like I’m maintaining the flashcards separately from the body of my notes – it’s a bit of a duplication of effort. It’d be good to get a flow where the flashcard is just part of the note as is, and I can pull it out without duplicating it.
  
I tried to manipulate it a bit, and my current workflow is incorporating it directly into my notes.
 Take this note, for example, about Edge Devices,
 * Definition :PROPERTIES: :ANKI_DECK: Computer Networking :ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic :ANKI_NOTE_ID: 1665541877624 :END: ** Front What are Edge Devices? ** Back - They are known as End-sytems or Hosts. These devices are divided into two groups: Clients and Servers. - These are the devices that recieves the internet as a service. *And, then here I continue with some more examples on the topic.* 
 And then I export it to Anki for reviewing.
 My question here is this a good workflow in the long run, as all my notes would take this shape?

                              <span>Hello,
 I needed a summary of my org clocks so I created a small program in Ocaml just for this. This is a simple program, it just sums everything it finds in org files that you pass on command line and outputs weekly/monthly/yearly stats about those files.
 The repo is here.

 I want to know if I can change the view of my org agenda from being a row type to a google calendar type of view or block such that I can see the days in a column rather than rows.

                              <span>I work with Scala every day but mostly writing RDDs or Dataframes to move data around and some IO here and there and although I try my best to incorporate Scala idiomatic solutions I&#x27;m finding it hard to gain more broad experience. I recently interviewed with a job that ultimately passed me because I didn&#x27;t have a ton of experience with Scala and they really wanted someone with hands on. 
 So my question is, how would you go about learning a bigger chunk of the language? I have started researching how to write a ray tracer and plan on doing that as a way to broaden my exposure to the language but besides that what else could I do to show I know my way around?

                              <span>I find I am still very newbie to Scala&#x27;s type system. I have the following code
 ​
  trait MyTrait[F[_]] { def method[I, O](f: I &#x3D;&gt; O): F[O] } class MyImpl extends MyTrait[Future] { override def method[Int, String](f: Int &#x3D;&gt; String): Future[String] &#x3D; Future(f(3)) } 
 When compiling with scala v3.1.1 and jdk 19, scalac complains error message as below:
 ​
 Future(f(3)) ^ Found: (3 : Int) Required: Int² where: Int is a class in package scala Int² is a type in method method 
 How to fix this problem? Thanks

                              <span>There&#x27;s a bad dynamic in America&#x27;s STEM education where kids going into college computer science out of high school hit a brick wall . . . largely made of math they&#x27;ve never seen before. In general, CS is not at all what they thought it would be. Then they switch/flunk out. So if higher-ed physics, engineering, math has a long, gentle preparatory on-ramp in K-12 with math, comp-sci has absolutely nothing -- or maybe just some &quot;learn to code.&quot; And so I&#x27;ve been trying to put together a high-school-level on-ramp for real CS . And I&#x27;m basing it on Haskell. Why Haskell? Because the top-tier schools all do some sort of typed functional programming eventually. Functional seems to be the fault line between the top schools and the 2nd-tier. So for example I mix in discrete math with Haskell. You could say I&#x27;m high-school-izing the Doets, van Eijck text The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming. Or even the Paulson ML for the Working Programmer, another fantastic book. Great, you might say. Trouble is I&#x27;m all alone -- as far as I know. For example, if you look at the AP Computer Science stuff, it&#x27;s basically learn to program Java with a smattering of data structures and algorithms tacked on. Not really much help for a kid walking into Cornell or CMU. Every high school effort I&#x27;ve come across so far has hardly ever been more than &quot;learn to code,&quot; typically Python. So my question to you is, should I keep going -- or give it up for a bad job? Am I really on to something, or am I tilting at windmills? The fact that I&#x27;m so alone on this is ominous. I&#x27;ve contacted lots of big name professors -- and they&#x27;re sympathetic but in the long run apathetic simply because they&#x27;re awash in 96th-percentile applicants. Yeah.... Your ideas would be appreciated.

                              <span>Never used both of these languages, but very interesting! Is there any other difference besides the syntactic difference? It is very interesting to be able to take an existing Haskell library that does not have proofs, for example, async, but with the help of some annotations and smt magic, prove the properties of your asynchronous code. Is it possible?

                              <span>Hi everybody! Haskell caught my attention because of its powerful type system. I come from a math background so I thought it&#x27;d be fun to implement some theorems in abstract algebra in Haskell. From what I understand, there are classes of functions in Haskell like  for example which represents an associative operation. What I&#x27;d really like is to implement a homomorphism type that sends f (x * y) to f(x) * f(y). The trouble I am having is that in mathematics we will always demand a proof that a map is a homomorphism before we give it its status as one. Is this not the case in Haskell? In other words, do we need to manually check that an operation is a homomorphism or is there some way for Haskell to recognize one (perhaps with a bit of assistance from the programmer/type system/something else)?

                              <span>Hi, I binded a function open-file-at-cursor. This allows me to open the file directly from a file (given I&#x27;ve written down the correct path). Now, I want to use something like this where I can give the file paths as environment variable. I&#x27;ve been struggling but couldn&#x27;t find anything related to this. Please help!
 Edit: Noting down the use case for this
 Let&#x27;s assume we have a file in path - /home/user/dir1/dir2/file.txt
 I&#x27;ve set some env variable $TEST&#x3D;/home/user/dir1
 In some other file (let&#x27;s name it file2.f under dir2), I&#x27;ve mentioned following two lines:
 ../file.txt
 $TEST/dir2/file.txt
 With the &quot;open-file-at-cursor&quot; bind, I&#x27;m able to directly open a file.txt when my cursor is on 1st line. However, the same bind breaks down for line 2. I&#x27;m expecting both lines to open the same file. ffap does not solve my issue as it opens the final directory that holds my file(this will increase my keystrokes).
 Thanks

                              <span>As a NixOS configuration grows in complexity, it may eventually become clear that it’s not optimally organized.
Maybe the entire configuration is in a single unwieldy file and needs to be broken up.
Maybe there are bits repeated for every machine which should really be placed in a common module.
This can become a problem in any codebase, but there is a trick for NixOS configurations that makes the process a whole lot less stressful.

Input Hashes
A NixOS system is defined by a configuration written in the Nix language.
The configuration sets various options and is evaluated into a build task for the system, which incorporates instructions for how to build, along with all the inputs they depend on.
Building the system involves fetching the inputs and executing the instructions, which genera…</span>

                              <span>hmmm I think I will have a hard time articulating this.
 I want to create a database that keeps track of all people that have access to some data. The database is shared by a couple of organizations, sub groups of that organization and specific characters/addresses/people/user within that organization on one table.
 Traditionally I would just use a hashmap of some nature.. the hashmap could look up the user and we would know what organization they are apart of and we could easily remove that person from the organization access table.
 But if we have an organization of 10million addresses/users that seems like a bad idea.
 SO the alternative idea is to create a set theory or a list of rules and if the user is apart of the table.
 example of table
 organization | SubGroup | specifc | action …</span>

 https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/q5w4q3/the_aeson_vulnerability_has_been_fixed_in/
  
I raised a ticket through Red Hat&#x27;s security response channels at the time: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id&#x3D;2004547. For some reason got closed but u/juhp revived it and it finally got its CVE assignment: CVE-2022-3433.
 If you needed a canonical CVE reference for the library issue now you have one.

                              <span>Hey there,
 Is there a way to allow a user to fill out an Org Capture template without having to fill out each section via the minibuffer?
 I ask because my keyboard kind of sucks and eats inputs sometimes, so the workflow gets jenk a bit. I would rather have some kind of checklist or small buffer that goes through each prompt than getting prompted by the mini buffer each time.
 Please let me know if this could be fixed by a package instead as well, thanks!

                              <span>From the AucTeX Changelog (v. 11.89):
  
To open the PDF output file you can now also use PDF Tools, a document viewer for Emacs. With it, as a plus, forward and backward search is accurate at word level.
  
I&#x27;m only able to achieve word-level accuracy on reverse sync search. On forward sync search, the arrow that appears in the left-hand margin of the PDF preview buffer can be off by as much as a half-dozen lines.
 Is there a way to configure AucTeX + PDF Tools in order to highlight the word in the PDF Tools preview buffer corresponding to where the cursor is positioned in the AucTeX latex source buffer during a forward search instead of placing an arrow in the left-hand margin, which by construction can only be line-level accurate at best?

                              <span>Im trying to have both to be displayed in the occur buffer title name. The buffer name from where the regexp is from and also the regexp too.
 I know about occur-rename-buffer but that gives only the buffer name not the regexp. When I run ibuffer I see this: *Occur: init.el* and *Occur: init.el*. That&#x27;s not very practical. Something like: *Occur: init.el* and *Occur: init.el* would be much better.
 I&#x27;ve found this: rename-occur-buffer-term which it does display the regexp but not the buffer-name :/ I tried to put both together but my e-lisp knowledge is very, very limited atm. 
 Is anybody here already have a fix for this?

 I&#x27;ve tried searching for a function/configuration that allows this to happen, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for other people, which suggests that there&#x27;s something wrong with my configuration. I&#x27;m not using mpd yet, just a fairly standard setup.

                              <span>I have been doing a lot of debugging with GUD lately, and I find myself wishing that the watch variables lived in one of the gdb-many-windows buffers, similar to the breakpoints and locals buffers. The speedbar can be a hassle to work with when I have emacs running fullscreen.
 My question really isn&#x27;t different from this question that was asked six years ago:
 Speedbar in GUD - gdb debugger and watch expressions
 but there were no satisfactory answers then, and I&#x27;m wondering if that has changed at all. Are there any customizations or packages available that would let me monitor watch variables without requiring the speedbar?

 I&#x27;m using Emacs 28.2 on windows and Emacs 28.1 on Mac. Same issue on both.
 Spacemacs wants to install evil-escape, but it does not seem to exist.
 https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape (Claims the package exists in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q&#x3D;esca (this query shows evil-escape does NOT exist in Melpa)
 https://melpa.org/#/?q&#x3D;evil (this query also fails to find evil-escape)
 So... what da heck? I hate to do this improperly but do I need to manually download evil-escape from github (first link) and stick it in the .emacs.d folder myself? Or is Melpa broken? Or spacemacs?

 I&#x27;d much rather have a repl running within emacs - and just be able to &quot;eval line&quot; or &quot;eval region&quot; as I&#x27;m going. 
 I have to assume someone in this amazing community has already figured this out - anyone know of any existing libraries/tutorials to hook this up?

                              <span>Hello M-x reddit!
 Ever wanted to write a function or command, but don&#x27;t know what the functions for say manipulating buffers or getting file names are called?
 Version 28 of emacs introduced a new feature called shortdoc. It gives an overview over available elisp functions in a few select categories. Use the command M-x shortdoc-display-group and then type in which category you want to view and a buffer pops up giving you a brief overview.
 Give it a shot. Its great!

                              <span>I do grok Vi(m). Used Emacs mostly for coding and org. I&#x27;ve been using Spacemacs for a couple of years, switched to Doom, used it for 2 years too. Lately due to work stuff, I&#x27;ve been using VSCode (not gonna get into details with this)
 Everywhere I edit text, I&#x27;d use the Vim keymap, it is already an extension of my mind in some way and I feel crampled when working without it.
 Lately, I&#x27;ve started building my Emacs config from scratch, to abstract myself from the computer I&#x27;m using and start gravitating towards using Emacs more as an OS rather than a code editor.
 I&#x27;ve been avoiding to use evil-mode and friends for two reasons:
  
I&#x27;d need to configure all the unimaginable keybindings to work properly with other packages (I&#x27;m aware of evil-collection though)
 I feel like the Emacs keybindings are designed like that in some way and that the part of the community that doesn&#x27;t use evil works in the same level of efficiency or better due to tighter integration between packages.
  
My question would be: 
 Is it worth the effort I&#x27;m taking to learn the Emacs keybindings, or is it just &quot;a different way of doing the same things&quot;?

 It seems that the way that Emacs can (eventually) use an AST built by tree-sitter to do syntax highlighting on program code should be applicable to natural languages using NLP libraries that build syntax trees.
 Here is a non-Emacs example: https://english.edward.io/

 In essence I want the layout in ergoemacs but only using layers for each of the different modifiers. Has anybody here done something similar or know any links I can checkout?

                              <span>Hi, I wanted to take fs2 for a spin and try writing a simple generic connection/resource pool in it. The way I wanted it to work is:
  
The pool is instantiated lazily with no open connections
 Connections are acquired when requested
 Each connection is exposed as an fs2.Stream[IO, R] where R is the type of the connection
 Each connection is checked for error before release–if error, then dispose of the connection instead of releasing it back into the pool
 The connection pool as a whole is instantiated as a Resource[IO, ConnectionPool[R]] and all open connections are released when the pool is released
  
I would appreciate if anyone could take a look at my code and offer any thoughts/feedback/critiques.

                              <span>What I want to achieve is that when I do C-c C-c in any block of babel, another block with the libraries I&#x27;m using load.
 For example: I&#x27;m using python and I want to use numpy and matplotlib. I don&#x27;t want to copy the lib import everytime I do a block of code, so I create another block at the start of the file where I import my libs, and when I execute another block of code this one loads before.
 There&#x27;s a way to do that, or I have to copy the imports everytime?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Title says most of it. I use a lot of latex equations that I label with #+NAME and reference with internal org links, as these work both in org-mode and turn into into latex references on export. The only thing missing is a quick way to be able to pick from previous equations to reference, like how reftex does it for normal .tex editing. Is there perhaps some existing library that solves this problem?

 I&#x27;m now getting to reading (and taking notes on) a number of publications in epub / pdf format mostly.
 I&#x27;d love to hear how everyone is dealing with references in books. My own (planned at this point) system would be to highlight passages in texts and paraphrase them in org-roam nodes.
 M-x highlight seems like the key here - is those highlights something I can reference from org-roam?
 bddean&#x27;s ereader and nov.el look appealing, especially with nov-xwidget.el for formatting on the latter.
 Should I spend time exploring both of these, or am I missing the point?

                              <span>Howdy. It would be much easier for me to do my note-taking if org-roam-node-find had the following behavior: - Pressing TAB changes the text in the search bar to whatever the suggestion list has highlighted. I&#x27;d like it to just replace the entire thing instead of doing that default step-by-step completion if possible. - Pressing ENTER opens or creates the exact match of what&#x27;s entered in the org-roam-node-find search bar. 
 Currently, I&#x27;m having some issues. My PKM note hierarchy uses dots as delimiters. Take the note res.lore.sw as an example (my note about Star Wars). I created it first. Now I want to create res.lore as an index for all the lores I&#x27;ve written about, but org-roam-node-find won&#x27;t let me create it, because it matches with the Star Wars note and opens it. I&#x27;d instead like to be able to either press TAB to set the highlighted file as the new search, or press ENTER to open or create the exact note id entered into the search bar.
 My current org-roam config is pretty much the minimum:  (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory &quot;REDACTED&quot;) (org-roam-complete-everywhere t) (org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;${title}.org&quot; &quot;#+title: ${title}\n#+date: %U\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t))) :config (org-roam-setup) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode))

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a created a class called Task that contains SignalRef and then an instance from that class
 case class Task(id: String,, cancel: IO[SignallingRef[IO, Boolean]]) val task &#x3D; Task(randomUUID().toString, SignallingRef[IO, Boolean](false)) 
 Thereafter, I put the task in a Map and calling it from two different streams.
 The first one is called from an HTTP request to set its value to “true”
  case DELETE -&gt; Root / &quot;tasks&quot; / UUIDVar(taskId) &#x3D;&gt; taskMap.get(taskId.toString) match { case Some(task) &#x3D;&gt; for{ switch &gt; IO.println(&quot;canceled&quot;) res  NotFound(&quot;Not Found&quot;) 
 and the other one is called from a &quot;stream.interruptWhen&quot; to cancel the stream when the value become &quot;true&quot;
  val httpStream &#x3D; for { cancelSwitch  x.toMap) .map(x &#x3D;&gt; x.asJson.noSpaces + &quot;\n&quot;) .through(text.utf8.encode) .through(Files[IO].writeAll(Path(s&quot;jsons/${task.id}.json&quot;), Flags.Write)) } yield httpStream httpStream.compile.drain 
 And it appears that I am doing something wrong because they don&#x27;t communicate with each other.
 P.S. I am Golang developer interested in the functional programming of Scala and its libraries CE3, FS2 and ZIO

                              <span>I&#x27;m newer to Haskell (know the syntax, some of the ideas behind certain stuff, but haven&#x27;t used it for anything serious), and I&#x27;ve always heard that Haskell based some of it&#x27;s concepts on category theory (monads, hask). Are there more abstract concepts in Haskell? Such as higher category theory and the Yoneda lemma. I&#x27;ve heard category theory be described as the linguistics of mathematics, so it only makes sense for it to have actually been used on a language.
 Thanks

                              <span>I would like to use eglot with the R language server. However, eglot does not seem to work well with either RMarkdown or Quarto documents as it hangs every time entering when enter a code chunk (up to 5 seconds or so). I am guessing it does this because it disconnects when entering the markdown mode and then needs to reconnect again. I am not sure. 
 I have two questions.
  
How might I be able to overcome this re-connection(?) issue with quarto or rmarkdown documents and still use eglot?
 Alternatively, how can I enable eglot just for *.r or *.R files and not just for ess-r-mode?

                              <span>I added flycheck onto the list package-selected-packages and ran (package-install-selected-packages) after reopening Emacs:
 (setq package-selected-packages &#x27;(use-package lsp-mode lsp-ui lsp-treemacs dap-mode company-mode flycheck prism aggressive-indent haskell-mode lsp-haskell)) 
 Then, I added this to my init.el (I use use-package):
 (use-package flycheck :init (global-flycheck-mode)) 
 However, even after doing that, when I open Emacs, I still get this error:
 Error (use-package): flycheck/:init: Symbol’s function definition is void: global-flycheck-mode
 It&#x27;s strange, because even though I installed flycheck, the function seems to be undefined. The use-package configuration is what they recommend on their website, as well (scroll to find the use-package section), so I don&#x27;t think the problem is calling (global-flycheck-mode).
 Does anyone have tips for what I should do next?

org-mode outline, that you see whole content, like in google map, you see whole world and you can zoom in to see continents, then countries, cities, districts, streets etc. and then can easy zoom out.
 
textinfo you can only go to next/previous or direct node, page, section, paragraph, without zoom in zoom out

                              <span>Hi. 
 I use Doom Emacs with lsp enabled. 
 I develop in PHP using Laravel framework. There&#x27;s a package called laravel-ide-helper that creates stub classes to help on IDE completion for properties and magic methods. 
 The problem is, when I x-ref-find I get two results, one for the correct method and another for the stub (they are all in a file called _ide_helper.php). 
 Is there a way I can filter out these results? Maybe blacklist the filename somehow?
 Thanks in advance. 
 Gonçalo

 I am using Emacs on Windows and I got this weird message. I also get errors but slightly different in Latex files. After searching around, it seems it must be something to do with \r\n but can&#x27;t find a solution.

                              <span>I often find myself switching between Emacs and terminal (e.g. xterm). A typical example is to run a test suite after editing some code. For years, I&#x27;ve been looking for a clean way to send code directly to a terminal without copy-pasting, and I think I finally found it. Best hack I&#x27;ve come up with in 12 years of using this editor. Here it is:
  
Install the absolutely excellent vterm package:https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm
 Create the following script, put it somewhere reasonable:#!/bin/bashemacsclient -e &quot;(progn (vterm) (vterm-send-string \&quot;$*\&quot;) (vterm-send-return))&quot;
 Install ob-tmux and configure:https://github.com/ahendriksen/ob-tmux(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal &quot;&quot;)(setq org-babel-tmux-terminal-opts nil)
 Enjoy!
 (e.t.a: with (setq vterm-enable-manipulate-selection-data-by-osc52 t) you also get integration between tmux visual mode and the kill-ring, which depending on your habits may be a more ergonomic way to copy/paste between terminal and emacs)

                              <span>I recently completed my emacs setup, everything works fine. but for some reason, the emacs daemon just freezes at startup when I run it outside emacs with emacs --daemon, so emacsclient doesn&#x27;t work.
 But when started with server-start inside emacs, everything works fine
 Here&#x27;s the output I&#x27;m getting, Did I do something wrong here?
 EDIT: It works now, it was selectric-mode that didn&#x27;t work for the server for some reason. I&#x27;m so dumb

It is hard to see detail in this result on my laptop, so I&#x27;d like the pdf to be zoomed in a bit by default. Also, when I use ctrl- mousescroll to zoom in the preview-pane, there is always a large margin to the left of the pdf page that I&#x27;d like to get rid of.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve reached a milestone of sorts. 3k zettel. Yes, I think of my zettel as moose—both singular and plural. I don&#x27;t care what @sfast said in Q&amp;A #6 - Plural of Zettel — Zettelkasten Forum. I&#x27;m sticking with the plural zettel. Zettel aren&#x27;t exactly just notes (notes being the plural of note.)
I have new strategies for searching The Archive for prior zettel to link to new zettel. Surfacing matches have become increasingly difficult as the volume in the herd of zettel has grown, but I&#x27;ve developed a nifty strategy. I&#x27;ll share soon.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to Scala and was trying to understand why my lazy function sumVal was not being tail-call optimized.
 For comparison, if I use the same body on a method, it works as expected. Appreciate any explanation or pointer to where I can read more about this.
 Note: I&#x27;m using Scala 2 in case that matter.
 lazy val sumVal: (Int, List[Int]) &#x3D;&gt; Int &#x3D; (acc, numbers) &#x3D;&gt; numbers match { case head :: tail &#x3D;&gt; sumVal(acc + head, tail) case _ &#x3D;&gt; acc } def sum(acc: Int, numbers: List[Int]): Int &#x3D; { numbers match { case head :: tail &#x3D;&gt; sum(acc + head, tail) case _ &#x3D;&gt; acc } } val numbers &#x3D; List.fill(10000)(2) sum(0, numbers) // this works as expected sumVal(0, numbers) // this blows up with a stack overflow

                              <span>So I came across this stackoverflow post and tried to implement my own StateIO monad where I could perform IO actions. Here is my code:
 {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans import Control.Monad (ap, liftM) newtype StateIO s a &#x3D; StateIO {runStateIO :: s -&gt; IO (a, s)} instance Functor (StateIO s) where fmap &#x3D; liftM instance Applicative (StateIO s) where pure &#x3D; return () &#x3D; ap instance Monad (StateIO s) where return a &#x3D; StateIO $ \s -&gt; return (a, s) n &gt;&gt;&#x3D; k &#x3D; StateIO $ \s -&gt; do (a, s&#x27;)  do x  MonadStateIO s m | m -&gt; s where getSt :: m s putSt :: s -&gt; m () instance MonadStateIO s (StateIO s) where getSt &#x3D; StateIO $ \st -&gt; return (st,st) putSt st &#x3D; StateIO $ const $ return ((),st) 
 Then I run a simple program where the user inputs a positive integer n and I return the first n fibonacci numbers with the use of the StateIO monad. 
 type FibNums &#x3D; [Int] main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;How many fibonacci numbers do you want to see:&quot; n  getLine) :: IO Int let initialState &#x3D; [n,0,1] process initialState process :: FibNums -&gt; IO () process st &#x3D; do (finished, newSt) &lt;- runStateIO addFib st print finished -- for debugging print newSt -- for debugging if finished then do putStrLn &quot;Fibonacci numbers are:&quot; print $ tail newSt else process newSt addFib :: StateIO FibNums Bool addFib &#x3D; do st &lt;- getSt let newSt &#x3D; st ++ [last st + last (init st)] finished &#x3D; length (tail newSt) &#x3D;&#x3D; head newSt liftIO $ print newSt -- for debugging putSt newSt return finished 
 The problem is in the function addFib the line &quot;putSt newSt&quot; does not really update the FibNums state variable and the initial state is returned. So the program loops on forever. 
 Any ideas what am I missing?

                              <span>Hi,
 As part of a project at university, I&#x27;m looking to formalize and implement a small DSL for proving statements in first-order logic based on Fitch notation. I&#x27;m going to implement this in Haskell.
 The implementation itself would not be a huge problem if I were to go by intuition alone, seeing as natural deduction in first-order logic is quite simple. However, since this is a project for university, I wanted to ask if you guys can recommend some interesting papers on various techniques and approaches (e.g. dependent type theory) that might be of use to me?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Haskell has generalized algebraic data types (GADTs). GADTs are a special case of dependent types. Fully dependent types are used in programming languages like Coq, Agda, Idris, etc.
 For those who want to understand the theory behind dependent types I have written a paper which describes in a textbook style dependent types in its purest form encountered in the Calculus of Constructions.
 It is a paper for mathematically oriented readers.

                              <span>TLDR: How to get maximum type level information when dealing with JSON objects?
 ​
 Suppose I have the following JSON:
 ​
 { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;some.type&quot;, &quot;someObject&quot;: { &quot;iExistBecause&quot;: &quot;type&#x3D;some.type&quot;, &quot;somethingElse&quot;: 420 }, &quot;moreFieldsAlwaysKnown&quot;: ... } 
 &quot;type&quot; can have a lot of values and in essence decides what &quot;someObject&quot; will be. I will omit moreFieldsAlwaysKnown for brevity. 
 I like typesafety so I naively thought I would encode this statically to make it users of my lib very difficult to create invalid values and track everything on the typelevel. In essence: 
 import qualified My.Module.Containing.SomeObject as SO -- Every &quot;type&quot; that can be transmitted over the wire. data MyType &#x3D; SomeType | SomeOtherType | SomeMoreType -- Typeclass allowing to go from type -&gt; value level. Serving…</span>

                              <span>I asked this question already on the Haskell discourse site, but asking here again for more opinion. 
 I’m trying to pick a language for a project I’m working on. Think of something like distributed redis with more persistent data structures and a schema. If you had to pick, would you build something like this with Haskell or would you stick with something like Rust or C++? Especially considering the query language for the database is more functional (term level haskell-like).

 I&#x27;m misunderstanding overrides/haskellPackages in some way. why is the code above not a no-op? It builds the world. (this is part of a larger investigation but i&#x27;m stuck on this question right now)

For instance, Qi&#x27;s type inferencing engine is Turing complete.
  
​
 Hi guys. I know this must be possible. But can you give me some examples in Haskell? Something like representing naturals and booleans with types, writing plus and if/else for them, etc.
 ​
 BTW, is Haskell&#x27;s type inference engine Turing complete? I guess the answer is no. But why? Does UndecidableInstances have anything to do with this?
 ​
 Obviously, this question doesn&#x27;t have a lot of practical value. It&#x27;s a rabbit hole. Sorry for that. I&#x27;m just interested. And would be glad to hear from FP experts in our Reddit giving me some hints.

 Update:
 Thanks all for your informative replies! I have had a busy day. Read your comments tomorrow!

                              <span>I am trying to write a website using yesod. The server needs some css and js files that I can include with juliusFile and luciusFile from the shakespeare library. If I add the files to extra-source-files in my cabal file the modules that need them even get automatically rebuild, when I change one of them.
 But I don’t want to write plain javascript or css. I‘d much rather write sass or typescript. So I need to compile those files so js or css if their source changes.
 Right now I use a custom build script with a custom buildHook that extracts the extra-source-files from the cabal file and builds them according to some build rules written in shake.
 How are bigger projects accomplishing this? Are they just using a makefile. Are they dropping cabal alltogether and only use shake? I know thats what GHC is doing, with their hadrian build system.
 I would love to hear of your experiences with different approaches! And yes I am procrastinating writing the thing I want to write really hard right now.

 I am an emacs beginner and I am running into this annoying issue where pressing Control-Basckscpace brings up the help menu, which is the same as pressing Control-h. I want to remap C-Backspace to the function backward-kill word but keep C-h for help.
 Currently, I have M-Backspace mapped to backward-kill-word be default, but I do not want to get used to that one because I use C-Backspace outside of Emacs. What is the best solution here? I have looked online and did not find solutions that work exactly like I want. Some remapped C-h which is not what I want to do.
 I am using wsl 2 ubuntu if that matters at all.

                              <span>Guys, hi
 I have environmental variable CFG and usually to use it i do smng like this:
 (use-package fixed-pitch :demand t :load-path (lambda () (substitute-in-file-name &quot;${CFG}/Emacs/fixed-pitch/&quot;)) ... ) 
 But i can&#x27;t make it work with yasnippet, instructions are:
 (setq yas-snippet-dirs &#x27;(&quot;~/.emacs.d/snippets&quot; ;; personal snippets &quot;/path/to/some/collection/&quot; ;; foo-mode and bar-mode snippet collection &quot;/path/to/yasnippet/yasmate/snippets&quot; ;; the yasmate collection )) 
 And i tried lots of things (commented out):
 (use-package yasnippet :ensure t :config (setq yas-snippet-dirs &#x27;(;; (substitute-in-file-name &quot;${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/&quot;) ;; (lambda () (substitute-in-file-name &quot;${CFG}/Emacs/snippets/&quot;)) ;; (concat (getenv &quot;CFG&quot;) &quot;/Emacs/snippets/&quot;) ;; (lambda () (concat (getenv &quot;CFG&quot;) &quot;/Emacs/snippets/&quot;)) &quot;~/snippets/&quot; ) ) (setq yas-indent-line &#x27;fixed) (yas-global-mode 1) ) 
 What&#x27;s the right way to do it?

  (use-package persp-mode :ensure t :custom (persp-mode-prefix-key (kbd &quot;C-c w&quot; )) :bind (&quot;C-x C-b&quot; . persp-list-buffers) :config (persp-mode) (setq persp-autokill-buffer-on-remove &#x27;kill-weak) (add-hook &#x27;window-setup-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (persp-mode 1)))) 
 For some reason, persp-mode isn’t loaded on initialization. What’s more interesting is it doesn’t load if I run persp-mode after Emacs is loaded, I have to execute persp-mode two times for it to work properly. Working properly for me means that C-c w prefix works.
 Any idea what I’m doing wrong?

 What would be a good symbol to use for reblog/retweet/share option? Looking for suggestions - preferably a unicode symbol.

                              <span>Age is a quite new specification about encrypting files and I wanted to use it to encrypt my org files instead of using pgp, as age can leverage the use of ssh keys that I already have and use. The reason is that I don&#x27;t have pgp keys and don&#x27;t want to bring the maintenance of it just to encrypt the org files.
 I couldn&#x27;t find any existing module and if it does not exist, how would I start to implement such feature?

 I have several common workflows which involve switching between buffers for files (that is, switching between buffers if the relevant file is already visited, or opening a new buffer visiting the file if not). There are generally two or three buffers or files in each group. I don&#x27;t particularly need any new workflow tools for switching between groups, just between files within a group. What&#x27;s important though is that these workflows are about switching between different types of file -- it would be very cumbersome to add all of the different pairs manually.
 Some examples to illustrate.

 After interacting with some redditors and doing some more research I wrote this comment where I concluded that the way Sublime Text handles line composed of whitespace is the most intuitive for me, at least when editing Python source files. Which can be summarized as:
 If I&#x27;m editing a buffer with the following Python code
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print(&#x27;2x⋅True&#x27;)$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅| 
 where ⋅ represents a space, $ represents a newline and | represents the cursor, if I press Return I want Emacs to end up like
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print(&#x27;2x⋅True&#x27;)$ $ ⋅⋅⋅⋅| 
 instead of
 if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅if⋅True:$ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅print(&#x27;2x⋅True&#x27;…</span>

 I need to do a project using Spark in Scala.
 I have already installed Scala.
 I am having difficulty in the initial setup, many guides are confusing and unclear.
 What should I do to start a scale project?
 What should I do to make spark work and therefore also &quot;import org.apache.spark.SparkContext&quot;?
 I would like to use the VisualStudio code.
 Can you suggest a procedure to follow or a clear guide?

                              <span>I do a lot of FP in other languages and now need to add some functionality to a large Scala2 code base. I am in a situation like this
 class DoerOfStuff { def doItThisWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_A, arg3, arg4, arg5) } def doItThatWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_B, arg3, arg4, arg5) } def doItAnotherWay(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user: String): ResultType { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, TYPE_ARG_C, arg3, arg4, arg5) } } 
 Where helper and performCheck require the implicit user argument. Actually there&#x27;s almost identical calls to more than one helper (and more than 5 params, don&#x27;t get me started about that), but I think the pattern is clear.
 I&#x27;d like to refactor that into something like
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) &#x3D;&gt; { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay &#x3D; doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay &#x3D; doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay &#x3D; doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 I want to avoid having to type the argument list in the class definition, so I wanted to stick with val instead.
 Is there a way I can do that?
 I tried
 class DoerOffStuff { doIt(typeArg) { (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)(implicit user) &#x3D;&gt; { performCheck() helper(arg1, arg2, typeArg, arg3, arg4,arg5) } } val doItThisWay &#x3D; doIt(TYPE_ARG_A) val doItThatWay &#x3D; doIt(TYPE_ARG_B) val doItAnotherWay &#x3D; doIt(TYPE_ARG_C) } 
 but the the type checker will say &quot;could not find implicit value for parameter user&quot; for all places of ... &#x3D; doIt(...)

                              <span>There are minimal configs for people who don&#x27;t like bells and whistles, and here are distros with tons of elisp files. I would like to see a single file config that is understandable and sets up most of the stuff you&#x27;d expect from VSCode or an IDE.
 The reason I&#x27;m asking is to show some non-Emacs folks a config that uses packages to really add some power while proving that it doesn&#x27;t take forever to create an Emacs config that does a lot.

                              <span>A friend at an old workplace told me this morning that his boss told him they were all switching to VSCode and it was going to be a company mandate. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve heard people be dismissive of long time Emacs/Vim users. My last personal experience was someone telling me flat out I was wasting company time playing around with Emacs rather than using Pycharm.
 I have also gotten into long arguments that devolve into &quot;feature-offs&quot; where I have to explain how a feature VSCode has is also in Emacs. I tried to explain that you can use GDB in Emacs, and someone literally laughed at me because GDB is &quot;ancient&quot; and VSCode&#x27;s debugging is modern and actually gets stuff done. It seems like even if Emacs can do something it&#x27;s also A. Not good enough B. Takes too long to configure instead of just getting the job done.
 So please give me some advice on how I should combat this encroachment on my peaceful Emacs pasture. Or should I just give up my goats and switch to VSCode?

                              <span>Hey guys, Im starting to learn some common-lisp but im struggling to get my IDE running correctly.
 I&#x27;m using a clean Emacs (v. 26) and have installed slime on it.
 I&#x27;ve got the following hello.cl and init.el
 https://gist.github.com/LucyJohnson-lua4life/e8c97bf931b7fd5795f5b9b22739c19d.
 I started &quot;slime&quot; and executed &quot;slime-compile-and-load-file&quot; on hello.cl, then i moved my cursor to the &quot;some-function&quot; symbol and executed &quot;slime-who-calls&quot;. By now I would expect slime to show me the 3 other lines where &quot;some-function&quot; was executed but instead i got &quot;No references found for some-function&quot;.
 Can somebody explain me how to fix this, or how to debug that?

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 ​
 I use Evernote to store my notes and access them on all platforms (Ubuntu/Linux, iOS, macOS). Apple platform has great desktop apps, but Evernote on Linux sucks. Are there any good Evernote modes available, so I can just use Emacs?

                              <span>So today I wanted to move a file to a specific location, using dired as ususal. By mistake I pressed a key that i shouldn&#x27;t( I don&#x27;t remember which one) and the file was moved somewhere but I cannot find where. I used find, and locate but nothing. I don&#x27;t have a trash can folder on my system so its rather impossible to have moved it there by mistake. 
 Does emacs, or dired provide any sort of &quot;history of moved files&quot; or something similar that will help me find the file?

                              <span>I tried eglot and so far it&#x27;s been a good experience compared to lsp, with pretty minimal setup, or at least for my need.
 the only thing i miss is being able to see the code actions available in the modeline and the project error list from flymake (not just the current buffer) in the modeline.
 It would be nice if there was a way to go to the previous/next error in project.
 anyone would know how to do that?
 flymake-show-project-diagnostics with eglot is so much better than lsp-treemacs tho, i love it just for that...

                              <span>I am using orgmode to author a paper for the first time. Citation is giving me a lot headaches. main.bib contains the references in bibtex format. paper.org contains citations like this Lecun et al.cite:lecun1998 
 $ ls -1 paper.org main.bib 
 At the very end of paper.org
 #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: main plain #+CITE_EXPORT: biblatex #+print_bibliography: 
 When I do C-c C-e l l I get the following error. When I use basic, the export successfully happens but there are no citations present in the tex file produced. cite:lecun1998 remain as such instead of \cite{lecun1998} as expected I suppose with basic setting.

 it used to work in emacs 27.1 but in the latest version it is not working.

One thing I have not figured out how to do is how to request a review from another team member. What should I input as an answer to &quot;Request review: &quot;? Is it their Github username? The username prefixed by &quot;@&quot;? Or is it their email address? None of the options seem to work for me.

 There is most likely another better way of accomplishing this, but I made the function below. In case if it is useful to anyone, it goes over an org file and builds and outputs a list of all tangled directives. Like clickable links:

 It can be used as a poor man&#x27;s toc.
 (defun mb/org-insert-tangle-toc () &quot;inserts a list of all the files tangled or about to be tangled.&quot; (interactive) (let ((toc nil)) (save-excursion (org-babel-map-src-blocks nil (if-let* ((args (nth 2 (org-babel-get-src-block-info))) (tangle (alist-get :tangle args))) (when (not (equal tangle &quot;no&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;toc tangle)))) (insert &quot;#+results:\n&quot;) (if (not (equal toc nil)) (cl-loop for index from 1 for item in toc do (insert (format &quot;+ [[%s][%s]] \n&quot; (s-replace &quot;/sudo::&quot; &quot;&quot; item) (file-name-nondirectory item)))) (insert &quot;: and there was nothing\n&quot;)))))

                              <span>I recently upgraded my Macbook to Monterey, and noticed a bunch of linker warnings:
 ld: warning: -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups 
 I&#x27;ve already cleared out ~/.stack, so it should not be using any old artifacts, with all artifacts being rebuilt on 12.6.
 It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, but it would be nice to get rid of it.
 Note: I was running into warnings like
 ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/lib/libpq.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (12.0) than being linked (11.1) 
 I fixed this by completely uninstalling Homebrew, reinstalling xcode-select, and reinstalling everything. I suspect I&#x27;m getting this new warning because xcode-select upgraded ld.

                              <span>im trying to convert given formula to an equivalent form, for negation and disjunctive normal form. i feel like i am at a good point but i have a lesser understanding of data types and structures in haskell that are limiting.
 here is how i defined the data type
 data Form &#x3D; Var String | C Bool | Not Form | For :/\: Form | Form :\/: Form deriving (Eq, Show) 
 and then negation normal form
 nnf :: Form -&gt; Form nnf (Var p) &#x3D; Var p nnf (C p) &#x3D; C p nnf (Not (Not p)) &#x3D; nnf p nnf (p :/\: q) &#x3D; nnf p :/\: nnf q nnf (p :\/: q) &#x3D; nnf p :\/: nnf q nnf (Not (p :/\: q)) &#x3D; (Not p) :\/: (Not q) nnf (Not (p :\/: q)) &#x3D; (Not p) :/\: (Not q) nnf (Not p) &#x3D; Not $ nnf p 
 and disjunctive normal form
 dnf :: Form -&gt; Form dnf (Var s) &#x3D; ((Var s)) dnf (p :\/: q) &#x3D; (dnf p) :/\: (dnf q) dnf (p :/\: q) &#x3D; undefined dnf (Not (Not p)) &#x3D; dnf p dnf (Not (p :/\: q)) &#x3D; (dnf $ Not p) :/\: (dnf $ Not q) dnf (Not (p :\/: q)) &#x3D; undefined dnf (Not (Var s)) &#x3D; Not (Var s) 
 i am struggling to get my dnf function to work properly or finding a correct approach. ive been using the nnf as reference for myself but any help/ suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 I managed to come up with a type class IsStrict which will give a type error if there is a non-strict field anywhere, at any depth, in the data structure given, explaining where the non-strict field is.
 Here it is in a gist: https://gist.github.com/anka-213/440cfef8c8712f5df747029640cfe170
 For example, if one were to ask if String is strict, it would give this error:  Found lazy field of type Char • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String Found lazy field of type [Char] • In constructor: : • In type: [Char] • When checking strictness of: String 
 It still works if we put the string inside some other data type, e.g. a strict pair &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; data StrictPair a b &#x3D; P !a !b deriving Generic
 -- Non-strict type in strict field -- &gt;&gt;&gt; nfStrict @(StrictPair Int String) -- Found lazy field of type Char -- • In constructor: : -- • In type: [Char] -- • In strict field of type [Char] -- • In constructor: P -- • In type: StrictPair Int String -- • When checking strictness of: StrictPair Int String -- ... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This is of course more strict than checking nothunks, since you might have forced the data in some other way, so the data is thunk-free without having the data type be fully strict.

                              <span>Hello folks! My apologies if the title sounds vague, I&#x27;m looking for advice or project ideas to secure an introduction to frameworks such as Play,‍ Akka and Spark. and to how they are being used in real world applications. I have some background in Rust, so getting familiar with Scala was pretty straightforward. I&#x27;m loving the language a lot and how natural it feels. However, I would like to start building some hobby projects by using the aforementioned frameworks if possible, but I&#x27;m not really sure where to start, or which of them is more beginner-intermediate-friendly. May I ask; does anyone mind suggesting a learning roadmap or drop some project suggestions/ideas? I&#x27;d deeply appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

                              <span>Having recently been bitten by an unexpected failed Future, I was wondering if there is anything like a &quot;safe&quot; wrapper for Futures. Basically, the goal is to make concurrent API&#x27;s inside an application not to have the hidden back-channel behaviour, yet still be composable in the usual way. A minimal implementation might be on the base Future to do a .transformWith(t &#x3D;&gt; Future.successful(t.toEither)) and then return that or wrap in EitherT, maybe wrapping either of those result types.
 Would need to support stack-safe flatMap for Cats-effect. 
 Just speculating, thinking aloud here.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to wean myself off the actor model. I&#x27;ve grown used to thinking of systems as supervision trees. How to represent these trees without actors? E.g., let&#x27;s imagine this tree structure is my app:
 - app: my app - scheduler: should wake up every quarter hour (0m, 15m, 30m, 45m) and perform a task - my_svc_pool: connection pool to a service that is called from within the scheduled task - my_svc: connection to my service - my_svc: another connection to my service 
 So let&#x27;s say scheduler wakes up, tries to run its task by calling out to my_svc_pool, but the particular connection that it got routed to in the pool happened to get disconnected right before that. So the service call fails and scheduler blows up and goes away, leaving my app running without the 15-minute scheduled tasks that were supposed to happen.
 How would you structure an app with futures or tasks or any effect system (leaving aside actors) to supervise the system as a whole such that:
  
If a service connection in the connection pool happened to get disconnected and we just found out, my_svc_pool should safely dispose of it and replace it
 If scheduler blows up on waking up and trying to perform its task, app should replace it with a fresh one

                              <span>Hello everyone.
 Im having a lot of fun taking my university (electronic engineering) notes in org-mode, using org-fragtog to toggle org-latex-preview and see math equations take life in real time.
 I&#x27;d really like to do the same thing with circuits, so I&#x27;m trying to use these tikz and circuitikz packages that let you draw circuits in latex.
 It compiles just fine, in fact when I export to pdf (SPC-m-e-l-o) the drawings are there.
 org-latex-preview also seem to try, very hard the first times I go over something, so my best guess is it&#x27;s actually compiling and actually thinking it&#x27;s showing it regularly, but no it doesn&#x27;t. 
 Has someone had any similar experience? or any idea on how to move forward? 
 Thank you guys

Don’t worry (about writing Haskell), be happy (writing Agda instead)! by Jesper Cockx
As we all know, static type systems are great to ensure correctness of our programs. Sadly, in industry many people are forced to work in languages with a weak type system, such as Haskell.

In this post I will describe the approach that I’ve recently introduced in rules_haskell
to achieve clear, maintainable and efficient tests for Bazel rules.

Why even bother?
All software needs to be tested and verified, and Bazel rules are no exception. Some of them are
popular public libraries with a lot of projects depending on them, and they need a proper test set

public API those rules represents. The same applies to the rules that live in huge monorepos growing every day,
where they often act as a glue between different components and can become complex, tricky and fragile.
Also every Bazel rule introduces…</span>

                              <span>I have a database query, it used to be a future. Since futures only run once, the result is &quot;cached&quot;, I can map over the future many times, the result is still there, don&#x27;t need to touch the DB again.
 How can I do this with ZIO? I tried memoize, but, if I map over the task 2 times within a for, it is &quot;cached&quot;, but if I call getFruits() 2 times from a zio-http api, well, it goes to the DB again.
 So I have something like this
 DAO:
 case class QueryService(quill: Quill.Cassandra[Literal]) { val fruits: Quoted[EntityQuery[Fruit]] &#x3D; quote { querySchema[Fruit](&quot;fruits&quot;) } } object QueryService { val live: URLayer[Quill.Cassandra[Literal], QueryService] &#x3D; ZLayer.fromFunction(QueryService(_)) } case class FruitsDao(queryService: QueryService) { def allFruits: Task[Seq[Fruit]] &#x3D; run( queryService.fruits ) } object FruitsDao { val live: ZLayer[QueryService, Nothing, FruitsDao] &#x3D; ZLayer.fromFunction(FruitsDao(_)) } 
 service:
  val fruits: Task[Seq[Fruit] &#x3D; dao.allFruits def getFruits(): Task[Seq[Fruit]] &#x3D; { val res &#x3D; for { f &lt;- fruits //f2 &lt;- fruits // memoize would only help here } yield doSomethingWithFruits(fruits) 
 and this is called from zio-http

                              <span>Hello there pretty people, an emacs newbie here, and would love some help.
 When I insert a new line in my Java file, I get a lovely, sexy tab for indentation inserted automatically.
 When I press the backspace key to delete the tab, all my tabs are changed into spaces. This disgusts me. It angers me. I am close to homicidal.
 Does anyone know how to stop this?
 I have tried running &quot;indent-tabs-mode t&quot;, but that does nothing, which makes sense, because tabs are already enabled.
 The functionality I want is simple. Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. When I delete a tab, it deletes the tab. When I delete a space, it deletes the space.
 I&#x27;ve been googling for quite a while, and can&#x27;t seem to figure it out.

                              <span>The transient package has a macro transient-define-prefix (docs). The following defines a complete prefix:
 (setq l1 &#x27;((&quot;vl&quot; &quot;visual lines&quot; visual-line-mode))) (transient-define-prefix foo1 () &quot;docstring&quot; [:pad-keys t [&quot;Appearance&quot; l1]]) 
 (The macro allows for a list of &quot;elements&quot; like l1 to be interpolated, something like a ,@ splice in a backtick context.)
 But having the variable l1 lying around feels like a loose end. The following approach looks better:
 (let ((l2 &#x27;((&quot;vl&quot; &quot;visual lines&quot; visual-line-mode)))) (transient-define-prefix foo2 () &quot;docstring&quot; [:pad-keys t [&quot;Appearance&quot; l2]])) 
 But it fails with &quot;Symbol’s value as variable is void: l2&quot;
 My understanding of elisp scope is clearly lacking.
 Is the problem that the transient-define-prefix macro is expanded within the let scope but the result is not evaluated until after the let scope is discarded? The elisp documentation for macros says that &quot;[t]he Lisp interpreter proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro&quot; but I may be misunderstanding this.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I just discovered Replit support Emacs Lisp, so I can set up my dotfiles and share to everyone to have a try.
 https://replit.com/@TxGVNN/dots
 In free time, sometime I clone everyone dotfiles to find new interesting snippet code. But when I clone and run, it can not up correctly. If we can have an environment like Replit, we can show correct set up to everyone to have a try. Yeah, seems we can use docker, gitpod.io

                              <span>Hi,
 I want to run emacs inside a development container (as I&#x27;m using Fedora Silverblue), but I&#x27;m having a weird issue:
 My config files are all in ~/.config/emacs/, but just after the launch of the container (distrobox-enter), emacs creates ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and ignores the config folder.
 If I stop emacs, delete ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d and restart emacs, my init.el in ~/.config/emacs/ is considered and emacs starts configured the proper way.
 For now I think I will just move my config folder, but if you think this is an issue I might need to report on the mailing list, or if you can help me investigate a bit more, feel free to help me!

 If I use C-X C-f to open an epub file I am faced with a blank screen with an error message at the bottom: &quot;wrong type argument: stringp, nil&quot;. I then have to do C-x b and select the buffer with the epub file.
 I am using emacs-28.2 on OpenBSD and should point out that I do not know lisp ( altho I have purchased a copy of Robert Chassell&#x27;s book and intend to learn).
 Any assistance is appreciated.

                              <span>Guys hi, i have following code block
 #+BEGIN_SRC python :var a&#x3D;localtable b&#x3D;folder/my-file:externaltable :results value table :return rtn import scripts.myscript as ms rtn &#x3D; ms.myfunction(b) #+END_SRC 
 any time i evaluate the code block passing variable b into function (it&#x27;s external file&#x27;s table) it puts that external file top into buffer-flip (as if i just switched from that external file).
 example say i flip between buffer1 (where above code block is) and buffer 2 (buffer1 &gt; buffer2 &gt; buffer 1 &gt; buffer 2, etc), but when i evaluate the code buffer flip becomes (buffer 1 &gt; external file &gt; buffer 1 &gt; eternal file)
 if i evalute the code passing variable a into function (local table) - buffer flip works correctly.
 I am not sure that&#x27;s buffer flip&#x27;s package problem that&#x27;s why i am asking here first - maybe i am missing some emacs / org-mode setting?

 I&#x27;s surprised that&#x27;s not a default option or I&#x27;m missing something?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been about 20 years since I used Windows, but I just started in a new position where I need to get up and running with it. I&#x27;ve got a lot of my config working already, but I don&#x27;t get how to do external package-management at all. My config is littered with :ensure-system-package statements that all fail. I&#x27;ve installed Debian subsystem and also mingw, but I don&#x27;t get how I can tie either of them in. I have found a few blog-posts about Emacs on Windows, but those were more about trivial things that I were able to figure out on my own.
 So. 1) Does the concept of PATH exist on Windows? \ 1.1) Can the PATH be changed to include something either from mingw or Debian subsystem?
 Looks like starting up the subsystem takes some time, so I&#x27;m also worried about performance. \ 2) Should I be going about this in another way entirely?

                              <span>There is a long discussion going on in the emacs-devel mailing list about renaming eglot. I am seeing various contradicting arguments from senior people... legends. So I am just curious what would be the name of the Emacs editor if it was created today. &quot;Code Editor&quot;? or if GNU was founded already then &quot;GNU Code Editor&quot; or GCE?

I was having a conversation one day and I couldn’t recall the name of a term, something I learned from a YouTube video. That bothered me. After the chat I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn’t find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: “what the heck am I doing?”. Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles. While reading through the subs I realized how much good stuff went past my ears (while watching the video).
  
It&#x27;s tiny and very simple, but I think can be used already.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m creating a wrapper around a pre-compiled C library (GLFW, I know bindings exist, it&#x27;s for figuring out how to use the Haskell FFI in a practical setting), and I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to get stack to include the C headers in the build. 
 This means that my build works, but I get a number of warnings about implicit function declarations during compilation. e.g.:
 C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Temp\ghc23648_0\ghc_5.c:8:61: error: warning: implicit declaration of function &#x27;glfwInit&#x27; [-Wimplicit-function-declaration] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} [...] 8 | HsInt32 ghczuwrapperZC1ZCmainZCMainZCglfwInit(void) {return glfwInit();} 
 I figured out how to add C libraries in package.yaml with extra-lib-dirs: and extra-libraries:. Unfortunately, when I browse the internet, the field it suggests for adding headers in Cabal, includes:, doesn&#x27;t actually get recognized by Stack:
 C:\Users\****\Workspace\Testing\ffitest\package.yaml: Ignoring unrecognized field $.executables.ffitest-exe.includes 
 Just to be sure, I tried to use the same field in stack.yaml instead, just in case it would be recognized there. It causes the same error.
 What is the appropriate way to include C header files in a Stack project, assuming there is one?

 The task is rather simple: I want to convert a play from HTML to LaTex. The structure is simple so it could even be done with Regex, but I want a proper solution.
 I want to use pandoc to read and manipulate the text. And there I need your help to get started.
 I managed to cabal install pandoc but how to go on? I couldn’t install it with --lib, so how could I now import it to ghci to play around with it?
 I’m thankful for any hints and resources.

                              <span>TL;DR: What am I supposed to do to use a Haskell web compiler that uses the &quot;main &#x3D;&quot; structure ...?
 Hi everyone,
 Today I finally decided to not just watch videos about Haskell but giving it a quick try to see how it works and feels.
 Since I just wanted to get a feel, I didn&#x27;t want to start installing everything (especially because it was more than one step like downloading one file and installing it, lazy here) so I just went for the many Haskell browser consoles (replit for example) and I just couldn&#x27;t do anything that I see in the many YouTube tutorials because of this &quot;main &#x3D;&quot; thingy. I then tried with a &quot;main &#x3D; do&quot; and writing under it but nothing works as in the tutorial, example &quot;sumOfNums &#x3D; [1..1000]&quot; among many others.
 What can I do if I want to just play around, test basic functions etc in a browser ? It seems that I am supposed to already know some level of coding architecture and in every basic tutorial I watched there isn&#x27;t any mention of such main &#x3D; ...
 It&#x27;s puzzling me how incredibly complicated this simple beginner step seems to be when comparing to, say, groovy web console, in which you can just type things, functions, classes etc...
 Thanks guys !

                              <span>I want to dive deeper into Haskell by using it to convert some HTML files to LaTeX. The structure of those files is quite simple; I just need to parse few different tags.
 The HTML document is a drama from gutenberg.org.
 What libraries would you recommend for that? Would tagsoup or HandsomeSoup be good choice?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to implement the following function, for working with cyclical musical scales:
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -&gt; Int -&gt; a -- cyclicIndex is total in its second argument -- provided its first argument is total and not infinite cyclicIndex xs i &#x3D; xs !! (i mod N) where N &#x3D; length xs i mod N &#x3D; unique representative of NZ+i in [0..N) 
 My attempt is
 cyclicIndex :: [a] -&gt; Int -&gt; a cyclicIndex xs i &#x3D; if i &gt;&#x3D; 0 then (cycle xs) !! i else (cycle (reverse xs)) !! (-1-i) 
 This seems to work, and the function is a simple enough function, but I am having trouble reasoning about its correctness from my specification. My attempts at calculating its correctness runs into confusion about mod in Haskell and mod in maths. In particular, I noted down the laws
  
cycle xs !! i &#x3D; xs !! (mod n i) for i &gt;&#x3D; 0 (note the mod is Haskell&#x27;s mod)
 reverse xs !! i &#x3D; xs !! (N - 1 - i) for i in [0..N)
 cycle . reverse &#x3D; reverse . cycle? (A free theorem? Useful?)
  
How might we approach this correctness problem?

 Is there any way to list the nearest header above a TODO item in agenda view, in addition to the file name? I’m thinking of those cases where a file may have several projects broken out under different headers like this:
 File name: ProjectFile.org * Project 1 ** TODO 1 * Project 2 ** TODO 1
 It’d be great if agenda showed:
 ProjectFile:Project 1:TODO 1 ProjectFile:Project 2:TODO 1
 Instead of just:
 ProjectFile:TODO 1 ProjectFile:TODO 1

                              <span>Guys hi, i have following code block
 #+BEGIN_SRC python :var a&#x3D;localtable b&#x3D;folder/my-file:externaltable :results value table :return rtn import scripts.myscript as ms rtn &#x3D; ms.myfunction(b) #+END_SRC 
 any time i evaluate the code block passing variable b into function (it&#x27;s external file&#x27;s table) it puts that external file top into buffer-flip (as if i just switched from that external file).
 example say i flip between buffer1 (where above code block is) and buffer 2 (buffer1 &gt; buffer2 &gt; buffer 1 &gt; buffer 2, etc), but when i evaluate the code buffer flip becomes (buffer 1 &gt; external file &gt; buffer 1 &gt; eternal file)
 if i evalute the code passing variable a into function (local table) - buffer flip works correctly.
 I am not sure that&#x27;s buffer flip&#x27;s package problem that&#x27;s why i am asking here first - maybe i am missing some org-mode / babel setting?

                              <span>When opening a buffer that has a language server installed (right now, that&#x27;s only clangd and haskell-language-server), the modeline says that LSP is activated, just disconnected.
 My config file is fairly short right now, so it shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult to diagnose the issue. I only have LSP and completion plugins installed at the moment. It also uses use-package. Although I think I&#x27;ve looked over all the instructions for each plugin properly, I must have missed something. I would appreciate the help.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to disable evil-mode in doom emacs because I don&#x27;t know vim keybindings beyond hjkl, :wq, :e, and switching between modes. Although this is enough to do basic editing, I would like to learn emacs &quot;the emacs way&quot;, as I&#x27;m not a vimmer. I&#x27;m just using doom emacs as a crutch while I get comfortable with emacs and lisp.
 ​
 Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried the following:
 comment out (evil +everywhere) with two semi colons in &quot;~/.doom.d/init.el&quot;
 ran doom sync
 added (package! evil-mode :disable t) to &quot;packages.el&quot;
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 deleted (evil +everywhere) from &quot;init.el&quot; completely
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 removed +bindings from :config default in &quot;init.el&quot;
 ran doom purge
 ran doom sync
 ​
 I&#x27;m not sure what else I should try.
 ​
 EDIT: rebooted my machine and evil is no more. Not sure at which point I could/should have rebooted but here we are.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of trying to set up emacs to be comfortable enough to replace vim as my daily driver, but one issue I have that I cannot figure out how to change is the indentation of wrapped lines in visual line mode.
 In vim, I currently have it set up so that when a line soft wraps, it will be indented by one tab width compared to the first line, as seen here: https://imgur.com/X6GTuaL
 In emacs, I have visual-line-mode and org-indent-mode enabled, which makes the soft wrapped lines flush with the first line (seen here: https://imgur.com/4xfBZnJ). I searched through google and any settings I could think of, but cannot find a way to indent the wrapped lines in emacs the same was as it is in vim.
 Is there a setting I&#x27;m missing, or a package that will do this for me? If not, is this something that could be done in lisp?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Lately, I&#x27;ve been defining my own regular expressions for parsing errors in the *compilation* buffers by adding entries to the compilation-error-regexp-alist and compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist variables. However, there&#x27;s a problem. This list already contains an enormous amount of regular expressions for all kinds of languages that I don&#x27;t use, however, these regular expressions also match errors of the language that I&#x27;m trying to add support to, and this results in extracting incorrect paths to files containing errors. I&#x27;ve set compilation-error-regexp-alist to nil and the problem disappeared, but now when I byte-compile elisp files, I get no way to jump to problems from the compilation buffer (well, duh, the regexp list now doesn&#x27;t contain an entry for elisp).
 So this creates a problem. I want my regular expressions to be the only ones present in the list when I&#x27;m working on a project in this language, and I want other regexps to be available when I&#x27;m working on other projects. I&#x27;ve thought about using dir-locals.el but my regexps use functions to get the file out of the error message, and I can&#x27;t put that into dir-locals reliably.
 Another problem is that the compilation-error-regexp-alist contains names of the languages it supports, but for example, there&#x27;s no elisp or emacs-lisp entry, yet the byte-compile warnings are highlighted correctly. And there&#x27;s no way to see what regular expressions are responsible for the matches in the compilation buffer, so it&#x27;s hard to debug what&#x27;s overriding mine.
 TL;DR: Ideally, I want compilation-error-regexp-alist to be configurable per project but I use custom functions that can break other people&#x27;s configurations who work on the same project as me and load dir-locals.el

 Does anyone have a hack that does this? I know that the project is essentially unmaintained at this point, but hopefully there&#x27;s someone in the community who knows. I think it would involve using the Conversation ID in the new API and using something like the existing twittering-get-replied-statuses function.

                              <span>I am having trouble getting eglot to work. With lsp-mode, I have no problem, but I am trying eglot since it&#x27;s lightweight and going to be included in emacs by default.
 Here&#x27;s the problem. I&#x27;m trying to find definitions for a struct, but eglot can&#x27;t find it.
 ​
 file.cpp has a function
 function (struct type_t *t1, ...) {
 type_t *temp &#x3D; t1; // this line here
 }
 ​
 When I do xref-find-definition for type_t, it simply shows me the &quot;struct type_t *t1&quot; in the file above.
 type_t is defined in another header, which this file includes. Why can&#x27;t eglot/xref jump to the definition in the file that defines type_t? lsp-mode, there&#x27;s no issue at all. (I am compiling my code with bear to get a compile_commands.json file).
 ​
 What am I missing?

                              <span>Something driving me (a bit) crazy when using emacs in a tmux session on a slow remote host.
 It would take quite a bit of time (we are talking 0.3s but enough to be annoying) to exit the normal mode when inside a tmux session. It would then do some crazy things too between those 0.3s if I start typing some letters...
 I discovered this spacemacs issue and buried in the comments this tmux setting : 
 set -s escape-time 0 
 which works exactly as intended and give you an exit to normal mode straight away...
 so if anyone else has this issue and find this post then I guess you are welcome internet stranger :)

                              <span>So Emacs has Mail mode for writing E-mail which, I believe, you could use on its own to write and sent an E-mail.
 Does it have anything similar for reading E-mail?
 Most modes that I know of are part of another package (like Gnus or Wanderlust or Mew, etc.) but lets imagine I&#x27;ve fetched my E-mail via some other means; home-grown, if you will.
 I, now, want to read them but I don&#x27;t want to roll my own mode to do so; repurposing another package&#x27;s for this purpose would probably likewise be fine so long as it could be isolated from the rest of the package (e.g. mh-show? But we&#x27;d want to avoid accidentally triggering mh-rmail while using mh-show, for example).
 I can&#x27;t seem to find a Mail mode equivalent but for reading mail, instead of sending.

 If anyone else would find this useful, I can put a little more effort into polishing it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve encountered a design issue several times, and I&#x27;m wondering what approach is most consistent with Haskell idioms/best practices.
 I&#x27;m implementing a data structure, call it Z a, with an interface for manipulating it where almost all of the functions in the interface return a Z a, with many of the form Z a -&gt; Z a or b -&gt; Z a -&gt; Z a. But for a few of the functions there&#x27;s no valid result for some edge case inputs, and it makes sense in those situations to return Maybe (Z a). 
 Now at that point, it makes sense to have every function in the interface return Maybe (Z a) because I can then sequence my operations nicely with &gt;&gt;&#x3D; 
 z :: Z a z &gt;&gt;&#x3D; op1 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; op2 &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (op3 x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (op4 1 2) 
 or something like
 pipe :: (Foldable t, Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; t (a -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a pipe &#x3D; foldM (&amp;) z :: Z a pipe z [op1, op2, op3 x, op4 1 2] 
 This is pretty convenient, I suppose, but then just one or two operations that have a Maybe result changed the entire interface to the data structure. An alternative would be to make the data structure itself an instance of Monad and make everything again -&gt; Z a. There are several advantages of internalizing, e.g., I can carry some extra information in the Nothing case or even have several failure paths; and several disadvantages -- the non maybe&#x27;d functions now have to do the boilerplate to check for the Nothing-ish inputs and pass them along for every function, whereas Maybe does that automatically.
 My question is what are the Haskell best practices/idioms for this decision. Where is the boundary for the choice between internalizing the Monad instance in the data structure type itself and just using something like Maybe for *all* the functions in the interface. 
 I hope my question is clear. Thanks for your help.

                              <span>Hello all,
 When using org capture templates with expansion variables I often find it&#x27;s confusing because you don&#x27;t know what information you&#x27;re being promoted to insert.
 For instance, if asked to a URL and then a description, all you see in the minibuffer is &quot;clipboard/kill value:&quot; repeatedly.
 Is there a way to customise that prompt? Or maybe have placeholders with useful names in the template that get overwritten?

 /home/igor/projects/git/test/www-mechanize/cookbook/00.cookbook.pl /home/igor/projects/git/test/www-mechanize/cookbook/#00.cookbook.pl# /home/igor/projects/git/test/www-mechanize/cookbook/00.lwp.proxy.pl /home/igor/projects/git/test/www-mechanize/cookbook/#00.lwp.proxy.pl# /home/igor/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-2629904-cooldown-nb-acer~ /home/igor/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/#.saves-2629904-cooldown-nb-acer~# 
 Then I do C-c C-c and it openes only the 1st file from the list 00.cookbook.pl, then it recovers it from #00.cookbook.pl# and stops recovering session. It doesn&#x27;t open neither the 00.lwp.proxy.pl, nor the older session file, that was previously open.

                              <span>I have a little problem with AUCTeX indentation. I am looking for some kind of settings that would &quot;simplify&quot; the indentation, if that makes any sense? Especially in math and tabular environments. Has someone come across anything like that?
 My reasons. Sometimes I need to move things around, align, or split to have a clearer structure. AUCTeX does not seem to respond well for that kind of manual writing and neglect all the work after hitting TAB or ENTER.
 I used to work with Atom, in which idea about indentation was very simple: when I decided to move cursor two extra tabs to the right, all following lines would hold on that indentation until I&#x27;d changed it. This helped me to structure long equations to see them better.
 I hope whatever I wrote make sense.
 Thanks

 This works really well, now I can add or remove rows and c-c c-c the formula to get the numbers back in order.
 But I want to do the same for dates. I can write functions (in/decremement date), but I don&#x27;t understand how I would hook them up to the tblfm thing... Any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

 In general, is there a common interface for this kind of stuff or its all language server dependent?
 Specifically I am using eglot with the digestif language server for editing latex documents but my question is a bit more general. What prompted this questino is a &quot;Wrong length of dash may have been used&quot; warning that I want to just ignore in the future.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a heavy user of TRAMP and I&#x27;m always looking for ways to improve the speed of my setup. Specifically, the pain points with TRAMP shows up mostly in dired and magit, where the turnaround speed (time spent to open a folder in dired, or time spend in any magit command) is quite high. I suspect this is due to the underlying process that TRAMP uses to connect to my remote server. My remote connection is relatively fast (100Mbps+). Things that I have tried till now are:
  
For my remote server, set the following flags in .ssh/config such that TRAMP re-uses the connections
  
 Host myfasthost ... Compression yes ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p ControlMaster auto ControlPersist 90m 
  
I use scp protocol to connect to TRAMP in dired. For example, to open a remote folder /path/to/my/folder, I use the following:
  
 /scp:myfasthost:/path/to/my/folder 
 Is there any other protocols I can use to ensure faster connections? Or any other tips/hacks to improve the TRAMP dired+magit experience? TIA!

                              <span>After trying to refresh my email setup, I ended up mistakenly (i.e. deliberately, but without considering the consequence) updating mu and mu4e. I was on version 1.5.5, and I&#x27;ve ended up on 1.8.9.
 This upgrade does seem to break a lot of my little tweaks to mu4e. I&#x27;ve managed to sort a few of these out, e.g. mu4e~proc-remove-id becomes mu4e--server-remove-id, mu4e~mark-check-target becomes mu4e--mark-check-target .
 But there are still a few bugs. I previously stole a function to convert an email to a .pdf file:
 (defun mu4e-action-open-to-pdf (msg) (let* ((date (mu4e-message-field msg :date)) (infile (mu4e~write-body-to-html msg)) (outfile (format-time-string &quot;%Y-%m-%d%H%M%S.pdf&quot; date))) (with-temp-buffer (shell-command (format &quot;wkhtmltopdf %s ~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s&quot; infile outfile) t)) (interactive) (find-file (format &quot;~/Mail/gmail/pdfs/%s&quot; outfile) ) )) 
 Now mu4e~write-body-html is no longer defined.
 My questions are:
  
Is there a replacement for mu4e~write-body-html? Or a different method to convert a message to pdf?
 
I&#x27;ve tried to follow the release notes here, but find it hard to follow... for instance, the releases jump from 1.4.15 to 1.6.0? (So where is 1.5.5?) Is there a compilation of all these changes from e.g. ~ to -- and other general refactoring?
 
 EDIT:
 Just found this warning in the documentation:
 The whole of mu4e consists of hundreds of elisp functions. However, the majority of those are for internal use only; you can recognize them easily, because they all start with mu4e~ or mu4e--. These functions make all kinds of assumptions, and they are subject to change, and should therefore not be used. 
 which explains the instability. Didn&#x27;t see this/know enough about elisp when I stole the functions. Fair enough.

Undoubtedly the worst binding I’ve had to deal with is C-x on emacs. I took the suggestion from the emacswiki and swapped C-u and C-x. I barely use C-u anyway, and this places C-x right under the pointer in the home row, which is very comfortable. Common sequences like C-x C-s and C-x C-e become optimal homerow rolls.
  
I was wondering how to do that natively in emacs without using karabiner/xmodmap or other OS dependent solution?

 But now I can&#x27;t figure how to overcome the next error.
 When I start a program in ghci which includes gi-gtk I get the following error:

                              <span>I am working through this blog post on building a simple interpreter, which uses the type Expr Value to describe an expression which evaluates to a value, and Expr (Value -&gt; Value) to describe an expression which evaluates to a function. 
 Now, the type constructor Expr has kind *-&gt;* by default, which I think is too general. I see no situation when we would put anything other than functions involving Value into it, and I think it could count as a programmer error if there was a value Expr a, where a is not in F, where F ::&#x3D; Value | F -&gt; F.
 Questions:
  
Is there a way to enforce this constraint in Haskell, e.g. using type families?
 Is there a nice way to describe F in Haskell?
  
One additional challenge is that data Expr a &#x3D; ClosedExpr a | OpenExpr Name (Expr (Value -&gt; a)) has useful functor and applicative instances, which I hope can remain.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am about to start a new project in Haskell, model checking with (new) tree-like data structures. I think it is best to start building on a library such that i can already have elegant base functions, yet i am wondering what library is currently the standard? I read about fgl ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl ), yet it is a very old library. 
 It is a proof-of-concept project, thus i would like to do this in Haskell (clean mathematical code + modularity) instead of a lower level language (C++, C).
 In my project i will need: 
  
memoization (during a recursive depth-first traversal)
 
labelled edges
 
nodes have values corresponding to a ordinal indicating their level.
 
some special nodes which transform my traversal function&#x27;s interpretation.
 
labelled leaf nodes
 
 Any recommendations?

This will be the next paper I will process. It is highly relevant for the next material for the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, I am processing the application to physics which is also a nice read.
To me, the key learning for the Zettelkasten Method is the heavy emphasis on decision making. I can&#x27;t express it precise enough to communicate it nicely. But there is a striking similarity to learning the Zettelkasten Method. Right now, many people try to learn it as if they learn something from a textbook. It feels rather &quot;formulaic&quot;. But it is important to get a feel for the implicit decisions you make through your actions. Yes, there are principles and good practices. But they will not serve you well if you are not aware of there rational.</span>

                              <span>Announcing the posit-3.2 library, where Real numbers are approximated by Maybe Rational. The Posit type is mapped to a 2&#x27;s complement integer type; smoothly and with tapering precision, in a similar way to the projective real line.
 The implementation includes word sizes from 8 to 256 bits.
 The library is implemented with several Haskell Language extensions:
 {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-} -- For our main type Posit (es :: ES) {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} -- For our ES kind and the constructors Z, I, II, III, IV, V for exponent size type {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-} -- For defining the type of kind ES that indexes the GADT {-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-} -- To decode the posit in the pattern {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} -- Added Strictness for some fixed point algorithms {-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-} -- for a nice NaR interface {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} -- To make instances for each specific type from Posit8 to Posit256 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} -- Allow non-type variables in the constraints {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-} -- To apply types: with &#x27;@&#x27;, it seems to select the specific class instance {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-} -- To convert between Posit Types {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-} -- To reduce some code duplication {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} -- To reduce some code duplication, I think the code is decidable but GHC is not smart enough ;) 
 The one area that I think Haskell or my understanding of Haskell can improve is with some code duplication in the internal &#x27;PositC&#x27; class. It would be neat to be able to make default implementations of class functions that are polymorphic over an associated type.
 Enjoy!

 I was happily using autostart (KDE Neon) to launch emacs emacs --daemon and connecting with the client. I reinstalled both emacs and doom to try to get org-roam working properly, and now I&#x27;ve lost daemon mode.
 If I run emacs --daemon in Konsole, I get:
  Warning: due to a long standing Gtk+ bug https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/221 Emacs might crash when run in daemon mode and the X11 connection is unexpectedly lost. Using an Emacs configured with --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid does not have this problem. Starting Emacs daemon. [yas] Check your &#x60;yas-snippet-dirs&#x27;: /home/MYUSER/.doom.d/snippets/ is not a directory [yas] Prepared just-in-time loading of snippets with some errors. Check *Messages*. evil-collection error: (file-missing Opening directory No such file or directory /home/MYUSER/home/MYUSER/roam) 
 I&#x27;m unable to connect to the daemon with a client
 I&#x27;m using doom, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a doom-specific issue. I can&#x27;t see anything in my config that is creating the duplication of /home/MYUSER/

                              <span>I will provide a video of it, and my .emacs.d repo at the bottom.
 I&#x27;ve only been using Emacs for about 4 days now, so I am by no means an expert at this, but since the beginning of the day, whenever I open a haskell file in Emacs it becomes EXTREMELY sluggish. I can successfully exit it, and enter any other filetype, but it does not react the same way as when I do it with haskell
 Here is a video:
 ​
 Around 0:26 is when I open the haskell file
 Here is the link to my config ( I tried using ORG mode to write it, but it reacts the same as the equivalent el file )

 It seems like one step forward, three steps back. There is always something about my setup which is broken and a barrier to actually using org-roam.
 This time, I did doom/upgrade to try and fix a link-display issue and got an error which suggested a doom sync. Unfortunately, that also gives the same error and my setup is now non-functional. The error is:

 Math templates don&#x27;t work in cdlatex mode - for example when I have $fr$ (or fr in \begin{math}...\end{math}) and press tab when the cursor is after r, it doesn&#x27;t expand to \frac{}{}.
 I tried this in both org-cdlatex-mode and .tex files. Things marked as TEXT or TEXT/MATH in org-cdlatex-command-help work, the ones marked as MATH don&#x27;t - pressing tab just moves the cursor out of the math environment
 What&#x27;s wrong?
 Edit: solved by installing auctex

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use the builtin completion at point in eshell to complete command arguments. E.g in eshell I&#x27;d type cd and hit :
 ~ $ cd 
 to open up the *Completions* buffer. Im currently using emacs 29.0.50 (commit 72c64dd73c), and so M- and M- can cycle through the completions (directories in this case with the cd command), while keeping the eshell buffer focused. The problem I&#x27;m facing now is how to actually insert the currently highlighted completion into my eshell buffer. Clicking on the completion with the mouse will insert it into eshell, as well as switching focus to the *Completions* buffer and hitting RET over it, but I&#x27;m trying to do this without having to switch focus from eshell. M- and M-, added new in emacs 29, allow cycling through completions while keeping focus in the current window (my eshell in this case), but I cant select one. The command minibuffer-choose-completion, which is bound to M-RET returns an error saying &quot;Text is read only&quot;, which I think is happening because it is trying to insert the completion into the minibuffer and not my eshell window. Moreover, completion-at-point for symbols in elisp files works as intended with M-RET, but not for eshell. Any help on how to sort this would be great. Thanks in advance

                              <span>I am running the following R code in a code block in org-mode.
 #+begin_src R :session :results output latex :exports results library(ggplot2) library(xtable) x  select(xmin, xmax, count) print(xtable(hist_dat, digits &#x3D; c(0, 1, 1, 0)), include.rownames &#x3D; FALSE) #+end_src 
 This creates the expected LaTeX code:
 \begin{table}[ht] \centering \begin{tabular}{rrr} \hline xmin &amp; xmax &amp; count \\ \hline -3.3 &amp; -3.1 &amp; 1 \\ -3.1 &amp; -2.9 &amp; 1 \\ -2.9 &amp; -2.6 &amp; 0 \\ -2.6 &amp; -2.4 &amp; 5 \\ -2.4 &amp; -2.2 &amp; 7 \\ -2.2 &amp; -1.9 &amp; 14 \\ -1.9 &amp; -1.7 &amp; 11 \\ -1.7 &amp; -1.5 &amp; 20 \\ -1.5 &amp; -1.3 &amp; 35 \\ -1.3 &amp; -1.0 &amp; 49 \\ -1.0 &amp; -0.8 &amp; 64 \\ -0.8 &amp; -0.6 &amp; 67 \\ -0.6 &amp; -0.3 &amp; 108 \\ -0.3 &amp; -0.1 &amp; 90 \\ -0.1 &amp; 0.1 &amp; 98 \\ 0.1 &amp; 0.3 &amp; 85 \\ 0.3 &amp; 0.6 &amp; 84 \\ 0.6 &amp; 0.8 &amp; 62 \\ 0.8 &amp; 1.0 &amp; 59 \\ 1.0 &amp; 1.3 &amp; 35 \\ 1.3 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 32 \\ 1.5 &amp; 1.7 &amp; 22 \\ 1.7 &amp; 1.9 &amp; 25 \\ 1.9 &amp; 2.2 &amp; 13 \\ 2.2 &amp; 2.4 &amp; 10 \\ 2.4 &amp; 2.6 &amp; 1 \\ 2.6 &amp; 2.9 &amp; 1 \\ 2.9 &amp; 3.1 &amp; 0 \\ 3.1 &amp; 3.3 &amp; 0 \\ 3.3 &amp; 3.6 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{table} 
 However, when I run org-export-dispatch and select export to LaTeX and As PDF file and open, I get nothing in the PDF (neither code nor the results). I wonder what I&#x27;m doing wrong.

                              <span>So from my understanding as someone still relatively new to emacs frames function about the same as windows with the biggest difference being frames position is managed by your os rather then emacs itself this means commands such as C-x o don’t work instead i would have to do C-x 5 o and it usually doesn’t seem to integrate as well from my experience is there a feature of frames that im missing that would make it more useful the only one i can thing of is i can move the frames around with my twm but emacs handles this well enough

 but when I execute this line ,this message apper in the minibuffer setq: Wrong type argument: plistp, :scale. Then, when I try to preview an Latex Fragment I get this message org-combine-plists: Wrong type argument: sequencep, :scale. I don know what to do.
 How I can preview LateX fragments again?
 How I can change the scale of the preview image whitout errors?

                              <span>Thanks to u/oantolin work my completion inside emacs has come to another level of comfort.
 I&#x27;ve been using orderless with some custom dispatchers for a while now, but I&#x27;ve always felt like something was wrong or too complex when using the OR operator (regex: \(pattern1\|pattern2\)).
 So today I invested half a hour into learn basics of Elisp string operations and have created my own dispatcher for that.
 (defun or-regexp (pattern index _total) (cond ((string-suffix-p &quot;|&quot; pattern) &#x60;(orderless-regexp . ,(concat &quot;\\(&quot; (concat (s-replace &quot;|&quot; &quot;\\|&quot; (substring pattern 0 -1)) &quot;\\)&quot;)))) ((string-match-p &quot;|&quot; pattern) &#x60;(orderless-regexp . ,(concat &quot;\\(&quot; (concat (s-replace &quot;|&quot; &quot;\\|&quot; pattern) &quot;\\)&quot;)))))) 
 I assume it&#x27;s not the prettiest code, but it&#x27;s enough for me

                              <span>I try to build a (docker) container with a pre-configured doom emacs instance.
 Now I&#x27;d like to pre-compile all the eln files ahead of time, so emacs does not compile the files every time the container spins up again.
 Native compile after startup
 I have set EMACSNATIVELOADPATH which seems to avoid that doom generates eln files in the tmp directory.
 I have set
 (setq native-comp-eln-load-path &#x27;(&quot;/home/emre/local/lib/emacs/28.2/native-lisp/&quot;)) 
 I have tried stuff like
 emacs --debug-init -q --no-site-file --batch --eval &quot;(progn (load \&quot;/home/emre/.emacs.d/early-init.el\&quot;) (require &#x27;doom) (require &#x27;doom-lib) (require &#x27;doom-start) (setq package-native-compile t) (setq native-comp-async-jobs-number 8) (setq comp-deferred-compilation nil) (byte-force-recompile \&quot;/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\&quot;) (native-compile-async \&quot;/home/emre/local/share/emacs/28.2\&quot; t) (while (or comp-files-queue (&gt; (comp-async-runnings) 0)) (progn (message \&quot;Items left to compile %s\&quot; (length comp-files-queue)) (sleep-for 1))) (kill-emacs))&quot; 
 Which doesn&#x27;t seem to work either ... 
 Has anyone an idea how I can achieve pre-compiling all eln files, that are shown in the output window?

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I copy text (outside of emacs) that can be one of these lines:
 57,655 45,049 45,363 (57,655) (45,049) (45,363) 57,655) (45,049) (45,363 57,655 45,049 45,363 $ 57,655 $ 45,049 $ 45,363 
 (amount of spaces/tabs can very, and number of elements is 3 most of the time, sometimes two)
 And need to paste it either as
 57,655|45,049|45,363 
 Or as
 (57,655)|(45,049)|(45,363) 
 (basically ignore everything except digits and &quot;,&quot; and separate elements with &quot;|&quot;)
 As i understand i need to create 2 custom paste functions (one regular, one with &quot;()&quot;s) taking original paste function as basis. I found the pasting function (via c-h k):
 (defun cua-paste (arg) &quot;Paste last cut or copied region or rectangle. An active region is deleted before executing the command. With numeric prefix arg, paste from register 0-9 instead. If global mark is active, copy from register or one character.&quot; (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (setq arg (cua--prefix-arg arg)) (let ((regtxt (and cua--register (get-register cua--register))) (count (prefix-numeric-value arg))) (cond ((and cua--register (not regtxt)) (message &quot;Nothing in register %c&quot; cua--register)) (cua--global-mark-active (if regtxt (cua--insert-at-global-mark regtxt) (when (not (eobp)) (cua--insert-at-global-mark (filter-buffer-substring (point) (+ (point) count))) (forward-char count)))) (buffer-read-only (error &quot;Cannot paste into a read-only buffer&quot;)) (t (cond (regtxt (cond ;; This being a cons implies cua-rect is loaded? ((consp regtxt) (cua--insert-rectangle regtxt)) ((stringp regtxt) (insert-for-yank regtxt)) (t (message &quot;Unknown data in register %c&quot; cua--register)))) ((memq this-original-command &#x27;(clipboard-yank x-clipboard-yank)) (funcall this-original-command)) (t (yank arg))))))) 
 and as i understand i need to modify &quot;arg&quot; before doing &quot;yank arg&quot;, but i have not idea how this &quot;modification&quot; should look like :) Could someone please help?

                              <span>I&#x27;m just starting with Doom and I&#x27;m experiencing some problems with it.
  
It demands the .so module requires recompilation at the drop of a hat. For some reason trying to run vterm after restarting Emacs requires it to be recompiled. It is as if the module itself is missing or Doom detects that some related source files have changed.
 
The vterm windows don&#x27;t have modelines or titles around them and that makes it hard to tell them apart when they are split. Is there some way to set these?

 How can I disable this and why hasn&#x27;t that been working setting the variable?
 Also, any other suggestions on things to disable to improve lsp-mode speed?

Wright Mills talks about his methods for note taking, thinking, and analysis in what he calls &quot;sociological imagination&quot;. This is a sociologists&#x27; framing of their own research and analysis practice and thus bears a sociological related name. While he talks more about the thinking, outlining, and writing process rather than the mechanical portion of how he takes notes or what he uses, he&#x27;s extending significantly on the ideas and methods that Sönke Ahrens describes in How to Take Smart Notes (2017), though obviously he&#x27;s doing it 65 years earlier.

                              <span>… would it be possible to implement it?
 I’m thinking of the lambda calculus as purely functional language with only anonymous functions. We could introduce recursion with the Y-combinator (λf. (λx. f (x x)) (λx. f (x x)). In the Haskell idiom it would be: (\f -&gt; (\x -&gt; f (x x)) (\x -&gt; f (x x)) which will give us an error because of Haskell’s type system. 
  • Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: t0 ~ t0 -&gt; t • In the first argument of ‘x2’, namely ‘x2’ In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(x2 x2)’ In the expression: f (x2 x2) • Relevant bindings include x2 :: t0 -&gt; t (bound at :19:40) f :: t -&gt; t (bound at :19:12) y :: (t -&gt; t) -&gt; t (bound at :19:5) 
 Is there any other way we could introduce recursion to Haskell if it wasn’t there already?

                              <span>Hi everyone 👋
 This year, I&#x27;m participating in Hacktoberfest as a mentor and maintainer. And I&#x27;m happy to offer my mentorship in the following two projects:
  
Haskell Beginners 2022 — a Haskell course for complete beginners. It doesn&#x27;t require any prior FP knowledge at all! And it&#x27;s format is perfectly suitable for Hacktoberfest. Read more information in how to participate instructions.
 Iris — a Haskell CLI framework I created earlier this year. It&#x27;s still at the early stage. But it has tons of beginner-friendly issues! Check out issues with the &quot;hacktoberfest&quot; label.
  
Feel free to ask any questions!
 Also, please, don&#x27;t hesitate to share your projects that participate in Hacktoberfest this year as well! 🤗

                              <span>So Gemini is a Gopher like protocol for basically static sites, and it struck me that org files would make a great basis for an interlinked emacs net.
 Has anybody thought of this, or made something like this? I would think it would do wonders for org-roam and the like.
 Anybody have any thoughts?

                              <span>One window is way too wide for my taste. I would rather have the same buffer twice, with a vertical split, than one wide window. Yet, on my screen, three windows at the same time is a bit much.
 Emacs usually opens the third window with a horizontal split, and I hate that. Say a daily note in org-roam. I would like to tell emacs there should always be two windows, opened side-by-side, not three, not one, no horizontal split. How do I do that?

 The library does not seem to specify how to do this / if it is possible, the library is found here:
 https://github.com/shg/org-inline-pdf.el/blob/master/org-inline-pdf.el
 ​
 The readme does not specify this, but the Code itself seems fairly small, i tried understanding it (its hard for me to understand), it seems it mentions something about arguments input, and as specified by &quot;man pdf2svg&quot; i should be able to supply page number as argument so i tried doing:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +CAPTION: This is a pdf page for notes
 +NAME: fig:l1p2
 +ARGUMENTS: 2
 [[./01_Introduction.pdf]] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 with no luck, hopefully a clever guy here knows how i can do this?

                              <span>Hello every one,
 I didn’t pay attention until recently, but I keep seeing the following warning while byte-compiling my preference files:
  Warning: ‘string-as-unibyte’ is an obsolete function (as of 26.1); use ‘encode-coding-string’. 
 I use the following code to convert arbitrary text (usually utf-8, but may be something else):
  (base64-encode-string (string-as-unibyte (buffer-string)) &#x27;no-line-break) 
 I did look at the encode-coding-string, but what bother me is that it seems that I’m obliged to set the original coding-system. But in my case it can change from time to time.
 Is there a way to keep the same &quot;magical&quot; behavior of string-as-unibyte function, with which I didn’t have to assume a possibly wrong source coding system? Am I correct if I say it’d be the undecided coding system? As in:
  (base64-encode-string (encode-coding-string (buffer-string) &#x27;undecided) &#x27;no-line-break) 
 As I’m reading the whole buffer content, is there a (local) variable holding the current buffer coding system?
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>I’ve been a Dynalist user for years, as my notes tend to follow a hierarchy, but I’m wanting to transition to org-mode for obvious reasons. When you search a page in Dynalist, you get search results in the context of each parent line (&quot;parent&quot; as determined by indentation level). The same goal is accomplished in ogrep.
 Is this type of search possible in emacs? In org-mode, I know there is sparse-tree, but it is not as &quot;sparse&quot; as ogrep or Dynalist, giving much more context than I sometimes need. This feature is so valuable to me that I&#x27;ll have to craft a solution with your suggestions if one doesn’t yet exist.

 How can I create a document outline like a tree whose elements are the lines matching my regex? Like this https://i.stack.imgur.com/t52dn.png

 I have an issue with the argument(s) to add at the end either it is $*, $1, $2 etc.
 When I have: alias mv eshell/mv --interactive --verbose $1 $2 it works for moving a single file but obviously fails when I&#x27;m trying to do mv foo1 foo2 foo3 bar/ (same story for cp). 
 So the question is: how can I use the Eshell version of mv/cp with an alias in the Eshell alias file?

                              <span>The problem with updating, upgrading and syncing Doom profiles is that you need to ensure that the ~/.doom.d and the path to bin/doom for the profiles do not conflict in your shell and I had to do some experimentation using ~/.emacs-profiles.el and ~/.doom.d/init.el to get this approach working.
 It is based on the idea that when managing your Doom installation with the doom sync, doom build etc commands you run the commands in vterm or term sessions from the same Chemacs2 session.
 You might consider this post an attempt to get others to find any bugs in my approach as I just got it working and the it works on my system caveat applies.
 Settings in ~/.emacs-profiles.el
  (&quot;doom01&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom&quot;) (env . ((&quot;DOOMDIR&quot; . &quot;~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/config&quot;) (&quot;DOOMPATH&quot; . &quot;~/config/emacs/profiles/doom01/doom/bin&quot;) (&quot;CHEMACS2PROFILE&quot; . &quot;doom01&quot;) )) )) 
 Command in $DOOMDIR/init.el
  (setenv &quot;PATH&quot; (concat (expand-file-name (getenv &quot;DOOMPATH&quot;) &quot;&quot;) &quot;:&quot; (getenv &quot;PATH&quot;))) 
 The setenv command in the Doom config&#x27;s init.el sets the path to bin/doom in that profile and ~/.doom.d is automatically taken care of by DOOMDIR.
 With the $PATH variable including the path to the relevant bin\doom vterm and term inherit them automatically and the doom xxxx commands work as expected.
 The values in ~/.emacs-profiles.el and that command in init.el are the sole source of truth for mantaining that Doom installations. You don&#x27;t need to set environment variables or paths anywhere else.

                              <span>Hello. Very long time emacs user here with a bunch of elisp under my belt - but this simple problem just eludes me.
 For years, I&#x27;ve done all my testing and running in a compile window.
 Emacs knows error messages that appear in that window, and I can use either M-x next-error to get to the error, or hit return on that line.
 This works pretty well flawlessly for me... but now I have a new tool and only a few of its errors get highlighted this way and I cannot see the difference!
 For example, in the run below, only the second error (fasteners.py) is highlighted and can be reached through next-error or carriage return: see https://imgur.com/a/I6P3egg
 -*- mode: compilation; default-directory: &quot;/code/engora-search/&quot; -*- Compilation started at Thu Sep 29 23:34:35 $ TERM&#x3D;dumb d engora test --refurb engora/network/request/url_request.py:37:13 [FURB126]: Replace &#x60;else: return x&#x60; with &#x60;return x&#x60; engora/parser/fasteners.py:107:9 [FURB126]: Replace &#x60;else: return x&#x60; with &#x60;return x&#x60; engora/server/search.py:26:13 [FURB126]: Replace &#x60;else: return x&#x60; with &#x60;return x&#x60; engora/server/server.py:39:13 [FURB126]: Replace &#x60;else: return x&#x60; with &#x60;return x&#x60; Run &#x60;refurb --explain ERR&#x60; to further explain an error. Use &#x60;--quiet&#x60; to silence this message 
 Why?
 My only theory was that fasteners.py:107:9 had three digits, the others two, but no: https://imgur.com/a/zgZ85M4 
 The output is already going through my own Python program, so I could easily rewrite it a bit without having to touch the refurb source - if I knew what was wrong.
  
Any ideas? This isn&#x27;t a game blocker for me at all, but it&#x27;s weirdly frustrating because I can&#x27;t work it out. :-D

                              <span>Running Eglot or lsp-mode while working on remote files seems to be a common and rather problematic use-case, so I&#x27;m trying to understand why so many people need this.
 I have several projects where I can&#x27;t or am not allowed to execute any code locally, and instead have a remote machine available for computations. But I&#x27;ve never encountered a project were I can&#x27;t have the source code itself locally. So what I do is to edit the code locally and periodically sync it with the remote machine.
 The syncing part is admittedly a bit awkward, but there are ways to make it easier or mostly automatic. And then all Emacs features and external tools work fast and smoothly.

                              <span>Have there ever been any efforts at offering a graphics API in Emacs?
 I.e. something like the HTML/JS browser canvas but in Emacs and programmed in Emacs Lisp of course.
 If it was powerful enough, the rest of Emacs&#x27; UI could be defined in terms of it.
 If there are previous threads or discussions around the web about this, feel free to link below. Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone, my company Mercury is hosting a Haskell meetup on October 20th, 2022 at 6 PM in downtown Portland. If you&#x27;re interested in giving a talk, we have slots for 25 minute and 5 minute talks. Talks already planned include:
 ​
 Practical STM: An Async Job Queue, by Jake Keuhlen
 ​
  
In this talk, we’ll walk through a brief introduction to concurrency and one of Haskell’s best tools for dealing with it: software transactional memory (STM). We’ll then use STM to build a simple but powerful asynchronous job queue.
  
Make your own Haskell, by Mitchell Vitez
 ​
  
We&#x27;ll explore the process of making our own Haskell-like language. Composition will lead us to trees, and trees will lead us to languages. We&#x27;ll grow, trim, typecheck, and reorganize these trees, populating our own little forested enclave. Finally, we&#x27;ll discover why our language can&#x27;t really be represented by a tree after all.
  
​
 We&#x27;ll have pizza delivered and the event will be bartended.
 The event is at the Power + Light Building, at 920 Southwest 6th Avenue.
 Please RSVP here if you&#x27;re interested: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/haskell-talks-at-mercury-tickets-424633328717. Note: You must RSVP through Eventbrite for building security to let you in.

                              <span>I am using org-cite + citar inside the org file. The bibliography is printed at the end of my essay with #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY: statement.
 How can I add some spacing between my bibliography references?
 Right now my references are divided by a single newline. I would like to add more spacing to make it easier to distinguish where a reference starts and where it ends.
