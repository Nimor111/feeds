                              <span>Just spreading the word about a(nother) great post by Mickey Petersen: https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/securely-generating-totp-tokens-emacs
 It is not a new post, but I received today an email from GitHub which caught me off-guard, stating that my account would require 2FA from now on. And I really hate to tie any workflow of mine to the phone. I recalled having read something about it, and some searching brought me back to Mickey&#x27;s post. Jackpot! Emacs to the rescue, with Mickey&#x27;s help.
 I ended up doing things a little differently, since my setup is not the same. I store my passwords in a .gpg file, and wanted to retrieve the totp key from there, instead of from auth sources. And I also preferred to use oathtool for the main task, instead of the adapted version of Jürgen Hötzel&#x27;s &#x60;totp.el&#x27;. Which, as a bonus, spared me of handling the base32 decoding.
 But Mickey&#x27;s post was really useful in showing an alternative and laying the ground work. You may find it useful too, since you are likely to have received or to soon receive the same GitHub message (if you didn&#x27;t already had 2FA set up).

                              <span>Independend of all other such requirements and approaches. I started my own little experiment of reassigning shortcuts, to what is known in most editors and IDE&#x27;s. Only did it in my .emacs file.
 It is about the known shortcuts like: Ctrl+C &#x3D; copy, Ctrl+S &#x3D; save, Ctrl+Z &#x3D; undo, Ctrl+Q &#x3D; quit, and 30 more of these.
 It is a work in progress (it is working well but has still has lots of ToDo&#x27;s), but I would love to get some feedback about it. (and if the feedback is: &quot;completly unnassasary, becase there is something better&quot;, that is okay as well)
 I like how I combined Ctrl-c for coping in transient-mark-mode with Ctrl-c keping it&#x27;s original functionality when nothing is selected. (At least I like the way it works, the elisp-code was just the best I could do).

                              <span>I have long used (set-frame-parameter nil &#x27;alpha 20) and put my Emacs frame on top of a Zoom frame* displaying a presenter&#x27;s screen share and used this to somewhat inobtrusively provide a place for me to take notes. 
 Emacs 29&#x27;s alpha-background frame parameter provides some more options to do this, and I was wondering if anyone had other suggestions. One complication is that most people use a white background for their slides, but Zoom will also letterbox or pillarbox it into something with a black background.
 The best thing I&#x27;ve found so far is to set some theme with a black background and white text (I&#x27;m open to suggestion on themes for this purpose) and then
 (set-frame-parameter nil &#x27;alpha-background 20) (set-frame-parameter nil &#x27;alpha 60) 
 This seems to have some balance between being able to see the Emacs frame at all and the Emacs frame not obstructing a text-heavy presentation. But if anyone else has tried something else that works, I would love suggestions!
 * using the Emacs terminology here because anything else would be confusing in context

 Can someone please suggest how to change the color of the &quot;CLOSED: &quot; and &quot;SCHEDULED: &quot; line when an item is DONE in the org mode? I have managed to get the header line gray with strikeout based on the code I found in some post (see below). The &quot;DONE&quot; line along with the contents appears gray and has a strike out because of the lisp code below. But the &quot;CLOSED:&quot; line and tags are still bright green. How do I change those based on the done state? Thank you.

                              <span>Hi friends, I do hope my message finds you all well. I recently started learning emacs (with doom emacs) and I&#x27;m pretty happy with my setup right now. However, my current daily driver is a low-end laptop, and I wonder what&#x27;s the best practice to start emacs so it won&#x27;t load a ton of packages to just edit a 1-2 files. I built emacs29 from source, with native compilation, I&#x27;m also lazy loading most of my packages, which are just a few, but I wonder if running &#x60;emacs&#x60; instead of &#x60;emacs -nw&#x60; or &#x60;emacsclient&#x60; , might be affecting my starting up time and cpu/mem consumption. 
 The later implies that I should start the &#x60;emacs daemon&#x60; on startup? What&#x27;s the difference between the options I mentioned above? I would appreaciate any suggestion. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have multiple chapters with numbered footnotes as:
 * Chapter 1 org mode [fn:1] *footnote* [fn:1] * Chapter 2 markdown mode [fn:1] *footnote* [fn:1] * Chapter 3 latex mode [fn:1] *footnote* [fn:1] 
 When I click the the [fn:1] in chapter 2 or chapter 3, it constantly jump to footnote [fn:1] under Chapter1.
 How could set the footnotes consistanly search forwards to jump around?

 This is a work built on the idea from my previous post. Thanks to the awesome package meow, without which I could not achieve it.

 how do I make it so that emacsclient can do this? I want to set a custom init file for emacsclient
 solved. thanks to lianacrossk7n for the help. I put the following in my ~/emacs.d/init.el
  (add-hook &#x27;server-after-make-frame-hook (lambda () (setopt user-init-file &quot;c:/emacs/.emacs.d/init.el&quot;) (setopt user-emacs-directory &quot;c:/emacs/.emacs.d&quot;) (load-file &quot;c:/emacs/.emacs.d/init.el&quot;)))

                              <span>Many tasks are -- or at least, eventually end up being -- multi-&quot;visit&quot; affairs. In other words, the work may end up being done as several sessions in a single day, or even across multiple days. Either way, it can be useful to log what was done at each &quot;visit&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of methods, in particular with a view to being able to produce some kind of time-filtered status report, perhaps via a clock table (cf. this question) :
  
Use org-add-note (C-c C-z) to add a timestamped note to the task, in the same way that state change notes get added. That&#x27;s nice and quick in terms of adding the info, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find a way of getting that into any kind of time-filtered report, 
 Create a sub-headline for each &quot;visit&quot; -- usually using org-capture with a C-0 prefix. I&#x27;ll clock into and then out of that and that means a clock table can pick up the sub-headline to use as my note of progress for that visit. It&#x27;s tolerable, but it still restricts that progress note to just a headline, and I &#x27;ll often want to say more than that. 
  
How do others log progress in tasks? Do many use org-add-note?

                              <span>Greetings everyone, 
 I hope you are doing well and good, so recently I decided to use the Xmonad window manager. I did so using GHCup and via cabal-install. I said yes to all the options afterwards so installed stack as well as Haskell language server. 
 However I now actually want to learn the language, There is so much stuff online however that it&#x27;s now confusing me. 
 Can someone please guide me, help me build a small road map perhaps as to how to begin. Also I am confused because someone&#x27;s using stack , someones using cabal and people suggesting stack but others saying stack is used for big projects ....I am lost guys, any help would be appreciated. 
 Thank you so much,
 Best Wishes.

                              <span>So I’m taking a class that involves Haskell. I’ve never used Haskell before, or any functional programming language for that matter, but I’m really enjoying it so far.
 However, the professor added a Tests.hs file that imports Test.HUnit so we can run and confirm the functions we implemented are correct, at least in a simple form.
 The issue is I’m lost on how to actually run the tests. “ghci :l Tests.hs” gives an import error for Test.HUnit. When looking up the package it mentions “runTestTT” but that just says there is no variable call that so I’m sure I’m running it incorrectly.
 There is also a cabal file that lists HUnit as a dependency. 
 How do I go about getting HUnit working? Thanks for the help!

                              <span>My idea is to have one generic single prompt for a Large Language Model like ChatGPT to:
Read an article or blog post.
Generate a list of atomic ideas to select from.
Create Literature Notes from selection in a given structure and format.

PROMPT: Read article and create notes. v1.0



Hello my friend,
Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. Here is my prompt framework with five steps I want to use to initiate our conversation.
Two hints: It is formatted in mark down. Do not use text marked as comment (%%text%%).
Step 1:  Setting the Stage
Step 2:  Defining the Objective
Step 3: Structuring the Interaction
1. Start Interaction:


2. Extract Atomic Ideas:


3. Identify Key Insights:


4. Ask for selection


5. Create Summaries:


6. Generate Descriptive Titles:



Step 4: Requesting Specific Information
Step 5: Summarizing and Concluding
**TITLE** 
&gt; SUMMARY 
Tags: LIST OF TAGS

Words in CAPITAL LETTERS are placeholders for your input. Start with a new line for each item.
From now on use the rules above. But before starting, feel free to ask me any question that may help you to improve the quality of your answers.

I’m sure it will need some experiments to get best results. What are your ideas?

Another installment of the What Are You Working On? thread.
Things I&#x27;m reading:
Blum, Andrew. The weather machine: a journey inside the forecast. 2019.
Solomon, Sheldon and Greenberg, Jeff and Pyszczynski, Thomas A.. The worm at the core: on the role of death in life. 2015.
Wright, Dale Stuart. Philosophical meditations on Zen Buddhism. 1998.
Donald, Merlin. A mind so rare: the evolution of human consciousness. 2002.
Illich, Ivan. In the vineyard of the text: a commentary to Hugh&#x27;s Didascalicon. 1993.
Programming  work/fun:
I&#x27;m refining my Vocabulary Builder, which uses Keyboard Maestro/OpenAI ChatGPT
Things I&#x27;m writing about:
I&#x27;m writing about the development of the reading brain from an anthropological-neuro-development angle. I am also outlining a historical fictional idea centered on the idea of reading&#x27;s escape from something only the privileged classes knew about, which occurred in Catholic monasteries in the 1200s. It is hard to grasp that before the 1200s, hardly anybody read, whereas now almost everybody reads.
How to develop the skill of conversationalism.
Music I&#x27;m listening to:
Ancient Future
SUSS
Hermanos Gutiérrez
Ideas I&#x27;m thinking about:
Creating a quick Backlink and Idea Graph demo for the ZK forums. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while. It answers the questions/complaints that The Archive doesn&#x27;t automatically create backlinks or an idea graph.
The weather.
The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.

                              <span>Hi! Since the last reddit post about org-timeblock, the biggest feature I&#x27;ve implemented (merged into master today) is multi-day views. You can now choose the number of days (1-7) displayed via command org-timeblock-switch-view. Here&#x27;s a screenshot:
 org-timeblock: Multi-day views
 org-timeblock is a new Emacs package that allows you to view and manage your orgmode tasks/events using timeblocking technique, which is implemented in almost all modern calendars.
 org-timeblock is interactive: you can navigate between blocks via mouse or arrow buttons; and then reschedule them or change TODO state. 
 Here&#x27;s a quick video demonstration: org-timeblock: Multi-day views

                              <span>There&#x27;s still a lot of tinkering to be done, but for basic usage it&#x27;s holding up pretty nicely. I was able to load my personal configuration and (most) of the packages I normally use.
 This was done using the termux apk found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/

                              <span>Proced will display a list of system processes (Think of it as Emacs built in Activity Monitor for Mac or Windows Task Manager). This is different than Emacs list-processes which displays all sub-processes started from within Emacs itself. Also comes with some handy filtering via its keymaps
 Pretty handy tool, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it much, but nice to know!

                              <span>I recently installed emacs 29.1 in fedora 38 using snap. Specifically using that link https://snapcraft.io/install/emacs/fedora 
 But emacs has this &quot;twitchy&quot; behavior where it goes &quot;back&quot; for a brief moment and returns to the current &quot;state&quot;. Let me give me example to illustrate the behavior better: Suppose I am the beginning of a line of text, then I run &#x60;C-k&#x60; to delete it. The line is deleted, then it shows up again for a brief moment, and then not anymore. Just to clarify, let me add the sequence of events:
  
(line present) Displays line
 (deteles line) &#x60;C-k&#x60;
 (line deleted) No display line
 (line deleted) Displays line for a brief moment
 (line deleted) No display line
  
This behavior happens with basically everything, meaning the new &quot;state&quot; (a word is typed, a buffer is switched, etc) is displayed and then momentarily goes back to the previous &quot;state&quot; (when the word had been typed, etc).
 My problem felt similar to this https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/112uuse/emacs_29060_is_bit_jumpy_scrolling_when_using/ but it isn&#x27;t because I emptied my &#x60;init.el&#x60; and the problem still persists. Also, when I run &#x60;emacs -nw&#x60; in the terminal, then there is no problem. So, it is something with the rendering, but I have no idea how to even tackle this. Any help/guidance is appreciated.

                              <span>I was so excited to discover desktop saving so my emacs window would start in the right place on my various laptops and second monitor setups. But sadly after I pulled the change down to my mac connected to very ultra-wide monitor emacs starts up far to the left and half off screen. (I had previously hacked it with some default-frame-alist stuff that was only good for one box).
 TL;DR: desktop saving code below worked great on single monitor laptop, but chokes when second monitor is ultrawide much bigger than laptop screen.
 Here&#x27;s the code snippet:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package emacs
 :custom
 (desktop-path &#x27;(&quot;~/.emacs.d/var/desktop&quot;))
 (desktop-save t)
 :init
 (defun rgr/restore-desktop()
 (when (fboundp &#x27;alert)
 (alert (message (format &quot;loading desktop from %s&quot; desktop-path))))
 ;;I include the run-with-timer despite being able to get this to work without as it&#x27;s a timing
 ;;issue and a little delay does no one any harm
 (run-at-time &quot;1&quot; nil (lambda()
 (desktop-read)
 (desktop-save-mode 1))))
 (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook
 (lambda()
 (if (daemonp)
 (add-hook &#x27;server-after-make-frame-hook &#x27;rgr/restore-desktop)
 (rgr/restore-desktop)))))
 #+end_src

                              <span>Hello guys. I&#x27;ve been using (neo)vim for 1-2 years now. I use emacs for note-taking only (rarely)
 The reason I use emacs much less than neovim is the simplicity (of lua) and performance.
 I find neovim REALLY fast while It&#x27;s obvious that emacs is less performant.
 Point of this post is: (as a non-power emacs user) 
 How&#x27;d you compare lua vs elisp
 How&#x27;d you compare emacs with a &quot;well configured&quot; neovim (in context of lua what is the difference between elisp? [except the power of GUI])
 - There are lot of plugins that will &quot;keep you in neovim&quot; (~~living~~) like plugins that integrate with web (e.g godbolt, stackoverflow etc.)
 - I am no near being a emacs power-user nor a GUI guy
 Why should I use emacs?
 Why not neovim
 ​
 &gt; I think Neovim can &quot;almost&quot; be powerful as emacs (while keeping the performance [0])
 &gt; Is it correct?
 &gt; [HERE IS LINK TO MY CONFIG [WIP] IN NEOVIM](https://github.com/UTFeight/CamelVim) -&gt; there is a feature list in README (outdated)
 &gt; [HERE IS MY EMACS CONFIG](https://github.com/UTFeight/dot-doom) -&gt; Simple doomemacs with org-mode 
 ---------
 [0] -&gt; Thanks to plugins like &#x60;Lazy.nvim&#x60; and lua

                              <span>I have installed the great package dired-preview from Prot, it works as intended.
 But it does not entirely fullfill my needs: I need to preview images in the minibuffer, when selecting them with org-attach C-c C-a c
 Any packages that does the job? Thanks for your ideas.

 Strangely emacs become as vim for text edition , navigation etc ... Spacemacs and doom are focused on evil-mode.
 I would ask if there is an emacs distro without evil-mode but focused on god-mode ? or with good integration ready from start ?

 I am emacs noob so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
 I have FlyMake running for java as shown in the screenshot. Is there any way that FlyMake shows how to fix error suggestions or is that simply not a feature of FlyMake? Like in the screenshot example, I want FlyMake to make the suggestion to import java.util.Scanner since I am using a scanner, not just simply tell me that there&#x27;s some error because it can&#x27;t find a Scanner object, that kind of stuff.

 However I found out Corfu will wait for LSP&#x27;s response and show all candidates. I want it to be like my Nvim, imediate show the buffer candidate or other candidate and update the result list when LSP responds.
 Can I do that? I found lsp-bridge can do that but I always want to use the package without dependencies (Python) and use native component like corfu. Hope anyone can help.
 Sorry about my English.

 I&#x27;m looking for code quality tools to analyse our projects and ideally include the results in our Gitlab MR.
 Are you using any tool? Which one(s)? How are you integrating it in your CI pipeline?
 I&#x27;m referring to tools such as Sonar, Scapegoat, ...

                              <span>I just started building a project that ends up as a CLI app. I have been working with Scala for a long time and I thought I can continue with it. While I have heard of Graal VM for a long time, this is the first time I&#x27;ll be using it. So far, I&#x27;ve been running into some weird build failure intermittently on Ubuntu. Whereas Windows/MacOS builds work fine. I&#x27;ll be using the Typelevel stack.
 While I&#x27;m continuing with my experiments at the moment, I was wondering if anyone here has any experience building with scala + graal. I&#x27;m also wondering if I&#x27;m better off with golang (hate the lang) or Rust (won&#x27;t be super productive for a while for me)

                              <span>Hi, Guys
 I&#x27;m successfully build a REST API via Haskell/Servant and have a OpenAPI spec generated by Servant .
 I&#x27;m thinking of building a web UI that enable user to play around with the API.
 Is there any way to automatically generate web UI form from openAPI spec or Haskell types ? 
 I&#x27;ve tried with https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form ,but the performance is poor when dealing with deep nested form with many inputs.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been doing basic Haskell tutorials (so far love it!). To me the next step is to make a small project to i) get some real world experience of writing something complete/useful in Haskell, getting to know some libraries beside prelude ii) showcase to eventual employer that I have a basic understanding of Haskell. I&#x27;m wondering if some of you went through this or had some suggestions for that kind of project (bonus point if it resonates with some real use case of Haskell, and is not a generic portfolio project that I would do with any other language). Thank!

                              <span>When trying to install packages, or even just use stack I get the following:
  
Error: [S-775] 
 Exception while reading snapshot from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/21/9.yaml:

It&#x27;s definitely not my internet connection, since I also tried it on a virtual Linux machine and it worked fine. I tried to purge stack, ghc, ghcup, cabal and then reinstall them via ghcup but I still get this. Cabal works just fine. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t delete everything before reinstalling, I don&#x27;t know where data is cached and I really don&#x27;t want to reinstall Linux to fix this. Any advice?

                              <span>Hello! 
 When I started college, I needed to create my school schedules mostly from scratch (selecting individual classes and checking that my classes didn&#x27;t overlap). Unfortunately, doing it manually is very tiring, slow and prone to error. 
 So I thought: why not automate it? this is the result of that experiment. Ofc, this is a haskell sub, so obviously it is written in haskell. I&#x27;d appreciate very much if someone more experienced than me wants to take a look at the code for some feedback! :)
 Basically schedule-maker works by creating a yaml file with the specification of the classes you might consider taking. Then run schedule-maker classes.yaml and it will spit out a schedules.xlsx file with a valid schedule per worksheet.
 There are a some more features. For more information the rep…</span>

 Sorry if this is not the right place or way to ask this kinda questions but all my attempts at google and stackexchange searches have failed to resolve this for me.
 The separator characters around the file name aren&#x27;t displayed as expected. Please see the image (bottom mode-line). I am attaching the code used for the relevant part.
 I agree that it is a mess but the nerd fonts is installed and works correctly in terminals (kitty, st-term, alacritty) and inside of both vim and neovim.
 p.s. it doesn&#x27;t work in xterm or urxvt terminals.
 Please see if you can shed some light on this behaviour.

 ​

 I&#x27;m glad to post whatever config seems relevant. Might this be an odd interaction with olivetti mode, org-indent mode, and visual line mode? Any hunches as to what variables I can tweak to fix it?
 All ideas would be very much appreciated!

 I almost posted a desperate question about HOW to do this, as I&#x27;ve been going in circles since yesterday afternoon. But I managed to get it to work, so I thought I&#x27;d share my solution instead.
 First, the problem description: As part of my 29.1 overhaul of my configuration I decided to add the pdf-tools package. I based my use-package block almost verbatim off of Sophie Bosio&#x27;s configuration. This has the advantage of delaying the install of the package until you first load a PDF. But upon opening a PDF, the installation failed when trying to build the epdfinfo server utility.
 I&#x27;ll spare the nitty-gritty details, other than the fact that i…</span>

 inspired by this post:
 Emacs: write a custom mode line
 I created:
 timu-line - A custom and simple mode line for Emacs
 ​
 The goal is a simple (as simple as possible) mode line. Just text and minimal but useful info.
 I wanted to gather some pointers and or critique from the community. 
  
What do you think?
 Is it melpa/nongnu-elpa worthy or even worth sharing?

                              <span>A while ago I noticed that after Emacs I did have all the magit commands available, but forge wasn&#x27;t loaded properly -- I saw no topics (Issues and Pull requests) not even in the project where I knew there were some and where I&#x27;d previously run forge-pull to set the local state up properly.
 Yesterday I thought I&#x27;d see if I could fix this. So started with trimming my setup down to the bare minimimum
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (use-package magit :custom (magit-display-buffer-function #&#x27;magit-display-buffer-traditional))
 (use-package forge :after magit) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and found that to be working well, i.e. I didn&#x27;t have to manually &quot;start&quot; forge by running e.g. forge-pull. I then re-introduced my setup piece by piece to see when it breaks. (Luckily it&#x27;s not very big.)
 In the end I made this change, where the relevant bit is this:
  (use-package forge :after magit - :general + :config (mes/despot-def forge-post-mode-map &quot;c&quot; &#x27;(&quot;submit&quot; . forge-post-submit) 
 That is, I swapped the use of :general to :config when bringing in forge. (I&#x27;m still using :general when setting up magit as using :configresulted in keybindings going missing.)
 I can&#x27;t pretend I know what&#x27;s going on here, but my gut tells me there&#x27;s some &quot;interesting&quot; interaction between straight.el, general.el going on.
 I&#x27;d love an explanation, but I&#x27;ll be happy enough if this post will reduce someone else&#x27;s head scratching when observing something similar.

Is there a way to save the window configuration, narrowed regions, and cursor placement for them so i get the exact same desktop when I return as when I last closed Emacs?
 I use desktop-save-mode but it doesn&#x27;t seem to save cloned-indirect buffers or narrowing.
 I do this when preparing teaching lessons. I have a window showing 3-4 learning goals in one small buffer, my study notes in a cloned indirect buffer, and my instruction notes in another cloned indirect buffer. Thanks for any help.

I&#x27;ve solved a lot of the push problems with auto commiting on change and hooks to push but am looking to solve the pull problem when I move to the other machine.
 I&#x27;m thinking about trying to use idle timers, since both are running emacs daemons, to do that but was wondering a) if anyone had any experience trying something like that and any found pitfalls or footguns; or 2) if there is a better/simpler way that I&#x27;m overlooking

                              <span>Hello,
My name is Kostas and I am 42 years old, having a wonderful family and for the last 20 years I have worked as a computer system and network engineer.
Two years ago I was hired by an international company and changed my career path, so I am currently working as DevOps. After this change, I noticed that I had some knowledge gaps I wanted to fill and some skills I wanted to improve.
I read technical documentation and watch online courses or webinars about technologies that were not my area of expertise, practices that are mostly in the software engineering world, new network or security concepts, and other stuff related to the so called &quot;soft skills&quot;, such as How to Write Technical Documentation, How to become Persuasive, Give successful presentation, foreign languages. And on top of that I have lots of family concerns such as, family psychology, recurring tasks, hobbies and other.
For all the above, my brain cannot keep everything and thus the search some months ago brought me in front of some new to me methods, like zettelkasten, BASB, How to Take Smart Notes and lots of software. But to be honest, I haven&#x27;t found my own workflow yet, what system to follow and what software to combine. I hope &quot;building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten&quot; will be something I could use for tasks and knowledge, but we&#x27;ll see 
I read so many great forum posts here and shared workflows, I watch your great videos in youtube and I try to adjust my workflow when I see something that could make it better.
I&#x27;m glad that I join zettelkasten.de forums</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to offload multi-line templates in my org-config to files to make formatting both the template and my config simpler. However I&#x27;m running into type issues.
 Excerpt:
 (defvar my/org-capture-templates-dir &quot;~/org/templates/org-capture&quot; &quot;Directory for \\&#x3D;&#x27;org-capture\\&#x3D;&#x27; template files.&quot;) (defun org-journal-find-location () &quot;Open today&#x27;s journal. Specify a non-nil prefix to inhibit inserting the heading&quot; (org-journal-new-entry t) (goto-char (point-min))) (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal Capture Group&quot;) (&quot;jd&quot; &quot;Daily Goals&quot; entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir &quot;daily-goals.org&quot;)) :empty-lines 1) (&quot;jj&quot; &quot;Journal&quot; entry (function org-journal-find-location) &quot;* %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)%^{Title}\n%i%?&quot;))) 
 Problem: When I try to invoke the template with &#x27;C-c c j d&#x27; I get:
 org-capture: Wrong type argument: stringp, (concat my/org-capture-templates-dir &quot;/daily-goals.org&quot;) 
 I can use &#x27;C-c c j j&#x27; perfectly fine to append a new entry in my Journal file.
 I can get it to work as desired if I instead replace the concat with the string I expect to get like so:
 (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal Capture Group&quot;) (&quot;jd&quot; &quot;Daily Goals&quot; entry (function org-journal-find-location) (file &quot;~/org/templates/org-capture/daily-goals.org&quot;) :empty-lines 1))) 
 Question: There&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not understanding about how to use the output of the concat function as a string for a filename here. I&#x27;d prefer not to type the full file name every time, especially as I define more templates. How can I get the concat to work?
 ​
 For reference, the template &#x27;daily-goals.org&#x27; contents are:
 * %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)Daily Goals Today I plan to: 1. %^{goal-one} 2. %^{goal-two} 3. %^{goal-three} %? 
 Also, my full capture config can be found here: paraparity configuration.org. I&#x27;ll always welcome feedback on my config and how I can terse up some of my emacs lisp.

 Depending on the things one wants to evaluate, it could be very useful like calls to (text-property-search-forward) for instance.

                              <span>For ages I have tried and failed to come up with an Org mode approach to answering the eternal question we often ask ourselves:
  
What (TF!) did I work on this week?
  
Or, more to the point, I want to get Org mode to answer the following question, often asked of us by our managers:
  
What did you work on this week?
  
In other words, I&#x27;d like to get Org mode to generate a share-able report that:
  
Draws from some pre-defined subset of all my org files. For example: all files in org-agenda-files plus whatever is in org-agenda-text-search-extra-files
 Includes any given headline (from the above files) if and only if it has a clock entry in a specified period -- last week, two months ago, etc
 Lists the headlines in chronological order (ascending, or user-selectable)
 Displays the headline itself, plus the relevant clock entry and associated text (i.e. it&#x27;s not just an clock table)
 Is exportable using org-export-dispatch &lt;&lt; This is important because the report is for more than just my own benefit. So, a mere dynamic view within emacs is not sufficient. I need to be able to produce a PDF, or HTML, or the like.
 Can do all this based only on the data and meta-data in the headlines themselves. That is, it should achieve my desired data output format without enforcing on me a data storage format. I&#x27;m adding this requirement because my (partial) solution to the problem so far has been to store my daily notes in a datetree format (fed by org-capture), which encodes information not just with a heading&#x27;s data and meta-data but also in its position. But that is neither a complete solution, nor a good one even where it does go part way.
  
How would/do you achieve this or something like it?[1]
 thx!
 [1] Ideally, using Org out-of-the-box, without having to write a bunch of lisp. But, failing that, I&#x27;d take pointers to lisp approaches. (TBH, I&#x27;d take the lisp itself, if you had it, but that would be above and beyond the call on your part! :-) )

 So I wrote this:

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I&#x27;ve been out of the Scala scene for a couple of years, and looking to find employment in my fav language again. What&#x27;s changed?
 Essentially, what I&#x27;m wondering is whether it&#x27;s worth it professionally to double-down on Scala in &#x27;23, if what I want to do is FP, DSLs or, at the very least, core-Scala, and not Spark?
  
What are the trends for industry adoption, besides Spark?
 
Is Spark still &quot;the killer app&quot;? (I&#x27;ve done some Spark, can&#x27;t say I liked it)
 
Is Scala 3 gaining traction in industry?
 
Are Cats/ZIO gaining traction, becoming more niche, and have the culture wars finally stopped?

                              <span>Hello friends, I&#x27;m getting the following error when I&#x27;m installing xmonad with stack. I&#x27;m using this custom GHC version that&#x27;s compiled with musl libc.
 configure: error: X11/extensions/Xrandr.h (from libXrandr) is required 
 Which makes sense, so I installed libXrandr from my distribution&#x27;s package manager (Gentoo). But unlike the many other times I have installed XMonad on a glibc system, this time installing libXrandr did not get the error to go away.
 I additionally installed libXinerama through my package manager but the output also complained that it does not find it, but it&#x27;s not required like Xrandr is so it&#x27;s not a big deal.
 I run the following command as indicated by the page of the custom GHC build.
 stack install --ghc-options &#x27; -static -optl-static -optl-pthread -fPIC&#x27; --docker --docker-image &quot;utdemir/ghc-musl:v25-ghc944&quot; --no-nix 
 My stack.yaml contains the following:
 resolver: ghc-9.4.4 packages: xmonad-git xmonad-contrib-git extra-deps: &#x27;random-1.2.1&#x27; &#x27;X11-1.10.3&#x27; &#x27;data-default-class-0.1.2.0&#x27; &#x27;setlocale-1.0.0.10&#x27; &#x27;X11-xft-0.3.4&#x27; &#x27;utf8-string-1.0.2&#x27; &#x27;splitmix-0.1.0.4&#x27; 
 I&#x27;d imagine it has do to with GHC being a docker image but I can&#x27;t be too sure.The issue is that despite installing the required dependency which would normally fix this trivial error,stack does not recognize that it has been installed.
 Please keep in mind that I&#x27;m in no way knowledgeable in anything Haskell related. Feel free to ask for any output or information.
 Any hints towards the right directions are greatly appreciated. Cheers!

                              <span>Hey there, fellas! Beginner haskeller here. I&#x27;ve come across an interesting problem when configuring Vim surprisingly.
 Description. Given several lists ordered by priority, I want to gather unique elements from them. There needs to be at most n elements overall. For each list there is its own limit k of elements I want to take from it. Only the elements that are actually taken (so, overall unique) come towards filling the limits. I attached some test cases in a separate file in case you want to give it a shot by yourself first.
 I decided to give it a go using Haskell as it is pretty abstract and I couldn&#x27;t come up with anything elegant using Python.
 The imperative version seems pretty straightforward, although I haven&#x27;t programmed it.
 Here&#x27;s my solution: https://gist.github.com/EgZvor/12268b0d439bd916c693c38b1fd853c8 . I can&#x27;t help but think it can be simpler, so as to improve readability of a hypothetical imperative version.

 Maybe this question is better suited for /haskellquestions but can you point out what is making this code so slow? (Taking more than 10 seconds before I aborted it) It is fast until r &#x3D; 10, b &#x3D; 10. Writing the equivalent in C++ has allowed me to compute r &#x3D; 100, b &#x3D; 100 in a flash. Something is up. It is a simple memoization task

 Probably the only non-trivial Scala 3 Android app in existence ;)
 It&#x27;s got all usual features of a standard calculator + an advanced editor where you can write complex mathematical expressions, and also save them for future use.
 Please check it out and if you like it, give it 5 stars, and tell your friends. Everyone needs a calculator written in Scala 3, after all.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a quick once over of the book &amp; decided it&#x27;s time to tackle it. I am planning on following along in Scala 3 as I figured while it might add an additional challenge, I should gain insights about either version of Scala in the process through contrast. Maybe flawed logic, we will see.
 From my limited experience, the main 4 differences I&#x27;ve picked are;
 Ember instead of Blaze when using HTTP4s,
 Opaque types / Iron rather than @ newtype / Refined
 Givens instead of Implicits
 Some difference when using Circe.
 Are there any other gotchas I should be aware of before I get cracking?
 Will this detour be beneficial for my growth or will it hinder my progress?
 It will not be the end of the world if I have to pivot but It&#x27;d nice not to have too many nasty suprises.
 Additionally if there are any other resources I should be aware of that would supplement the read well I&#x27;m all ears.
 Currently have;
 Red Book,
 Scala with Cats, &amp;
 Programming in Scala 5th ed. for reference.
 Still slowly getting to grips with Cats (essential effects would be nice) but figured I would learn by example &amp; reference with Cats.

                              <span>The Pekko has the classical transport, which is using Netty 3, and Netty 4 has better performance and fixes the CVEs.
 In later release of Akka, which just remove the classic transport (Netty 3) and in favor of Aretry transport.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on Sixel support in Eat for a while. It is not very fast though, Emacs redisplay engine is inefficient showing large number of images. Other than that, it works perfectly for me.
 The current implementation uses SVG to display Sixel image (and UTF-8 half block character when Emacs is itself running inside a terminal). Is there any other image format that is faster in Emacs?
 If you don&#x27;t know what Eat is, Eat (Emulate A Terminal) is a reasonably fast pure Emacs Lisp terminal emulator for Emacs. In addition to other things, it features better keybindings, shell integration, mouse support, and now, Sixel support.
 And by the way, I was thinking about a talk about Eat at EmacsConf. What do you think?

                              <span>The emacs-mac Emacs port uses native Mac tabs, which blend in better with other apps, can be manipulated by mouse, and provide a nice &quot;tab overview&quot; (graphical thumbnails of all open tabs), etc. But one feature tab-bar-mode had over native tabs is the ability to save/restore the tab configuration, via desktop.el.
 mac-tab-desktop is a tiny package that enables saving/restoring the native Mac tab configuration with desktop.el. Simply turn it on and it just works like you&#x27;d expect. It can also be used for other tools that manipulate &quot;framesets&quot;.

                              <span>Hey,
 In my current emacs 29.1 setup I have frame titles setup &quot;dynamically&quot; by setting:
  
(setq-default frame-title-format &quot;%b - Emacs&quot;)
  
This works well for the first frame created but every other frame created with C-X 5 2 or emacsclient have a title set to initial buffer file name, it seems. 
 Am I missing something or have I come across a bug?
 EDIT: I should probably add that I run a PGTK build under swaywm.

 or the same, with make bootstrap.
 The result of configure shows dependencies found. Do you know what the problem might be?

                              <span>For a college course I need emacs and mozart I managed to download both but I seem to have messed up the pathing as I can’t compile any programs on emacs
 I get an error: cannot open load file: no such file or directory, c:/program files (x86)/Mozart/Emacs/emacs-26.1-86_64/bin/runemacs.exe/share/elisp/oz.elc 
 I’m using emacs 26.1 and Mozart 1.4 and I’m on windows 10 (The reason you see a second emacs in the pathing was because I wasn’t sure if unzipping the emacs file would create another file or just send it all over the place)

 One question I have, are you supposed to keep adding entries to the diary file for ever? I found diary-include-other-diary-files and suspect I can use it to make archive files, but didn&#x27;t find any specific recommendations. That prompted this post.
 I also take notes with howm, found this in the EmacsWiki: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowmAndCalendar, wondering if anyone here used it...?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have the ~/.authinfo.gpg file in my home directory, and I can encrypt/decrypt the file correctly.
 When using auth info, if the info is already in the .authinfo.gpg file, emacs will ask me to unlock my gpg key, then it can use the auth info correctly.
 But if the auth info is not in the .authinfo.gpg file, it will prompt me to save it into the .authinfo file, and the content is not encrypted.
 Any idea why auth info can automatically read from .authinfo.gpg, but cannot save to it?
 Thanks

 I installed emacs 28.2 through conda:
 conda install emacs&#x3D;28.2
 ​
 The path of emacs is /fs0/xxxxx/xxxxx/opt/condaEnv/AccreLibEnv_latest/bin
 It can be open but it shows a message like this:

I want to remove this number from packages, should say
 web-mode
 php-mode
 helm-mode
 How can I do that? I didn&#x27;t know what to write to search engines.

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering how many in the community would be interested in a more coordinated effort to move away from Reddit and into the growing alternatives?
 I know that network effects are hard to overcome and that some of you don&#x27;t particularly care about the issues with Reddit management, or don&#x27;t make &quot;fighting against Social Media and Big Tech&quot; a hill to die on, but I strongly feel like the time for centralized social platforms has passed. We gave away too many of our freedoms in exchange of convenience, but now the costs are too much to ignore.
 You might have received already a DM from me inviting you to join our Emacs community on Lemmy. It&#x27;s slowly but steadily getting traction and activity, to the point that you might have even seen it mentioned at Sacha&#x27;s blog.
 Over there, one of the things that we are still missing is content from people with questions, or small tips/tricks to share. I was thinking of automating some of this work I&#x27;ve been doing and I started working on a small bot that could post a comment on every &quot;self&quot; post asking the OP to also take a look at the alternatives. 
 The question is: would that be ok with the mods and the community here? If a bot posting on every comment is too much I can maybe make a rule for limiting to 2-3 submissions a day, but more than anything I would like to know if the community at large would consider this alternative or if most are actively in favor of sticking to reddit.

 Basically, I&#x27;d like to make a pretty chronological journal. Anyone have a simple solution or a custom function already set up for this?
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>Teaching kids Roblox studio has got me reading into the background of luascript as its used for the studio scripting language:
 &quot;The influence of Scheme on Lua has gradually increased during Lua’s evolution: initially, Scheme was just a language in the background, but later it became increasingly important as a source of inspiration, especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping&quot; 
 https://www.lua.org/doc/hopl.pdf
 Neovim -- I understand this to be the hot new thing in the vim world [1], correct me if I&#x27;m wrong -- uses luascript too. Emacs has the evil-mode of fame (amongst other modal editing packages). This whimsical post is just me pontificating on how all&#x27;s well that ends well in regards to the editor wars of old that I was too young to experience firsthand. 
 Only took a couple of decades lol. I am curious though, regardless of emacs or vi keybindings, I believe it common to use &#x27;ctrl&#x27; more than &#x27;alt&#x27; so I&#x27;ve swapped them. Anatomically speaking, our thumbs are stronger digits than pinkies. Am I right in assuming that&#x27;s the reason so many of the venerable default bindings are on &#x27;ctrl&#x27;?
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard
 How many years before this accident of history is undone, lisp machines become mainstream and we eradicate the dreaded &#x27;emacs pinkie&#x27; like humanity has done to smallpox? Rhetorical question, you can tell I&#x27;ve too much spare time on my hands.

 Has anyone tried doing something similar?

                              <span>Emacs for Android got a really awesome feature that allows to access files in SAF document providers.
 SAF document providers are the closest things to FUSE that Android can offer. NextCloud implements a document provider, giving its users the ability to keep local copies of cloud files transparently, keep placeholders of online-only files, offer bidirectional sync.
 However, as the Emacs manual states, document providers are kinda limited:
  
Subprocesses can&#x27;t access files in the document provider (this means no shell commands)
 No symlinks are allowed
  
This is kind of a deal breaker: simple editing of Org files could still be feasible, but anything slightly more advanced might not. Using nov.el, for example, is not feasible since it require extracting with the tar command.
 A solution is to simply copy files outside the /content/storage/ (document providers directory) before opening them in a buffer. However doing so manually is stressful and not tidy at all. Is there a way to transparently copy files in a temporary location before opening them, and automatically update the source file when needed?
 What could be other ways to make document providers more practical to use?
 TIA

                              <span>Recently, I experience that Emacs opens a large numbers - currently more than 700 - of empty buffers in fundamental-mode. They all have the name *emacs* or *emacs:err*, with NN being a number. I have no idea what purpose they are supposed to fulfill, but at some point, they become so many that it blocks other operations in Emacs (&quot;too many open files&quot; error), and I need to restart Emacs to get rid of them. 
 Any suggestions how to troubleshoot it and figure out how to avoid this happening?

 Specifically I&#x27;m using project-find-regexp and I&#x27;d like to visit matches one by one, work on them, go back to the results, visit another match and so on.
 The way it works at the moment it pops up results in the minibuffer and vanishes when you visit a match.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using emacs 29.1 and I&#x27;m starting to learn rust.
 Also I recently started learning the joys of lsp-mode. 
 When I start lsp-mode in a rust-mode buffer, the minibuffer gives me the message::
 &quot;Server rust-analyzer:1412060/starteing existed with status exit(check corrosponding stderr buffer for details). Do you want to restart it? (y or n)&quot; 
 If I respond in the affirmative the question just pops up again. So obviously the language server has failed to load.
 If I do &#x27;M-x lsp-install-server&quot; I am not presented with options. 
 How do I get a language server to run with lsp in rust mode?

                              <span>I have just started using Org, and I have read the documentation on org for &#x27;clock&#x27; and &#x27;time-stamp&#x27;, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to make it simply insert the time stamp when I press the keys. It always either enters a date without a time or gives me a mini-buffer where I can press RET to insert the date without the time or manually type in the time before pressing RET to insert the date and the time. 
 How do I make it simply insert the date *and time* without prompting me for anything?

                              <span>Is there a way to specify the archive directory on startup?
The reason being that I want to set up a second directory for a work project that I will eventually pass off to someone else so I need to keep it separate from my personal stuff.
I did a quick scan through the forum and couldn&#x27;t see an answer. Thanks.</span>

 I took the Cuda certification course and have been trying to learn Haskell for a couple of years now. And now that I just graduated from GaTech OMSCS I finally have time to do so continuously but am becoming more interested in using Haskell for HPC applications. I am trying to work through Programming Massively Parallel Processors, 3rd Edition by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu and see books on O&#x27;Reilly Online but which ones are good?

                              <span>Lets assume I have a function f that performs two different actions depending on whether it is called for the first time or not.
 How could I achieve this? Should I use the state monad, which I didn’t really understood yet?
 My actual problem is a graphical application with a save button, which has to open a file dialog when clicked for the first time, because we do not have a file name yet. But if we have already created a file it should just overwrite the file.
 So what would I need to do with this example function in order to let it handle the state.
 onButtonClick :: ByteString -&gt; IO () onButtonClick text &#x3D; do state  do file  writeToFile text file 
 In my case this function needs to have an &#x60;IO ()&#x60;, I guess, as I am using GTK and this is how it gets invoked.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gtk-4.0.8/docs/GI-Gtk-Objects-Button.html#v:onButtonClicked
 I know there is a lot of material about the state monad, but I can’t really see how to use it in my case
 Solution: 
 I was thinking to complicated as the solution is fairly simple as /u/AshleyYakeley pointed out.
 I Just need to create an IORef FilePath with:
 fileRef  ByteString -&gt; IO () onButtonClick fileRef text &#x3D; do filePath  do file  writeToFile text file

                              <span>I have a RESTful a-little-more-than-a-toy backend with Servant and I‘d like to write a frontend for it.
 I‘d like to learn something new here and I don‘t have any hard time constraints, so I’m open to suggestions and learning opportunities. 
 Maybe I should experiment with PureScript and Halogen? But maybe there‘s a Haskell alternative? Re-using code with the „isomorphic“ approach of Miso seems to be very interesting, but I know almost nothing about it. It uses GHCJS, is this still state of the art now that the JS backend of GHC is out?
 I‘d like to share Haskell code, but I also would love to have a smooth developing experience and overall elegant declarative code. Any suggestions for me?

                              <span>Here&#x27;s my config for org-gcal:
 (use-package org-gcal :init (setq org-gcal-client-id &quot;...&quot; org-gcal-client-secret &quot;...&quot; org-gcal-fetch-file-alist &#x27;((&quot;myemail@gmail.com&quot; . &quot;~/gmail.org&quot;) )) ) 
 I was able to use org-gcal-fetch and get all of the current calendar entries into ~/gmail.org
 If I create a new entry and use org-gcal-post-at-point it creates a new calendar entry on google calendar. I then change the name of the entry in the org file and then use org-gcal-sync it updates correctly in google calendar as well.
 But on entries that already existed in the calendar before the original fetch, I can push them to with org-gcal-post-at-point to update the title. But org-gcal-sync never work.
 I would expect org-gcal-sync to make google calendar match the org file. Am I misunderstanding how org-gcal works or is this a bug?

 My implementation is not sophisticated but it works on transmission in the directions of local-to-local, local-to-remote, remote-to-local and remote-to-remote. However, it&#x27;s not working on multi-hop SSH connections.

I have installed &#x60;ruff&#x60; (yet) another python linter and set this variable to &#x60;(&quot;ruff&quot; &quot;--quiet&quot; &quot;--stdin-filename&#x3D;stdin&quot; &quot;-&quot;)&#x60; but flymake does not report any errors when enabled in a python buffer. I&#x27;m aware of the &#x60;flymake-ruff&#x60; package but was wondering if setting this variable would mean I didn&#x27;t need that package. Thanks for your time.
 Edit: I found this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/10yzhmn/flymake_just_works_with_ruff/) and saw how to correctly set this variable but still no joy. I&#x27;m still on Emacs 27.1 if that matters but the latest flymake.

 These kinds of emacs addition makes evil even powerful than vim.
 Though I didn&#x27;t find any mention of this feature in the evil documentation. Are there other evil features like this?

                              <span>In some of the projects I work with, there might be 25+ imports at the beginning of a file and I almost never need to look at them. On the other hand, I almost never use code folding, and my config already has so many packages in it that I wondered if I could hide those imports using only built-in functionality. Surprisingly, hideshow.el apparently doesn&#x27;t have this functionality built in, so I took a crack at making it happen.
 After some fiddling, I came up with this: 
 (defun rex/php-fold-use-block-initially () &quot;Hide the initial block of &#x60;use&#x27; statements in PHP buffers.&quot; (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (ignore-errors (re-search-forward &quot;^use &quot;)) (set-mark (point)) (while (ignore-errors (re-search-forward &quot;^use &quot;))) (ignore-errors (hs-hide-comment-region (region-beginning) (region-end))) (deactivate-mark t))) (add-hook &#x27;php-mode-hook hs-minor-mode) (add-hook &#x27;php-mode-hook rex/php-fold-use-block-initially) 
 This does what I want, but it&#x27;s not elegant and it seems pretty fragile (then again, it hasn&#x27;t broken yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of days now). Because it does work, I figured it might help someone else too if I shared it, ymmv. 
 EDIT: In order to hide import/include/whatever keyword your language uses to include code from libraries or elsewhere, you would need to change the regex pattern &quot;^use &quot; to &quot;^include &quot; (for instance) and add the appropriate mode hooks. 
 P.S. Now that I think of it, this function should actually be generalized to accept the pattern as an argument...

                              <span>This might be a dumb question. I read through the manual and was confused regarding properties and tags. What I want to do is something like this:
 :PROPERTIES table: #+attr_odt: :style tablestyle #+attr_latex: :environment longtable :END: 
 then later i want to be able to tag a header with that property label so that it inherits all of those attributes:
 * I&#x27;m going to put tables here :table: | hello | my | table | | is | here | hello 
 Is creating a group of attributes possible in org mode? 
 edit: i&#x27;ve found that I can achieve this with macros. Still curious if there&#x27;s a way to group a bunch of attributes in a non-macro way

                              <span>I read this article - Free Monad in Scala, and its video, where it implements FlatMap with natural transformation. My question: if I want to implement a generic version of Free Monad (it&#x27;s generic enough a little bit like ZIO, Cats but it doesn&#x27;t need to be production grade), is this the right direction?
 I have this question because I want to play with this concept by implementing it myself. Then I started to search online, finding an explanation like this. I understand the point (though not thoroughly understand everything regarding this term I suppose); however, when checking the examples on the internet, most of them use &#x60;List[A] &#x3D;&gt; Option[A]&#x60;, or tap in Cats.FunctionK. I am confused generally how it&#x27;s implemented. Is the example in the video is good enough, or some other implementations are recommended as references?
 Many thanks for answering my elementary school level question.

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I want to learn Scala as my second FP language. I know Haskell and I am somewhere between an Apprentice &amp; Journeyman. In the sense that I can read and understand Haskell code, and write trivial programs and rest services. I am quite familiar with Haskell Transformers and general FP style of programming.
 With this background, I was looking to dive into Scala and learn the language for fun (&amp; maybe profit). Programming in Scala seems to be the authoritative book for this. I have two questions.
  
Is it a good choice for someone who knows Haskell and general FP principals?
 If yes, should I go for the 4th edition which is for Scala 2 or the 5th edition which is for Scala 3?
  
​
 TIA!

 This would help with project planning. Otherwise I would need to update every TODO seperately when the timing changes.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the latest git version with pgtk and native comp and I&#x27;m noticing a bit of lag when I just move my cursor through a file. I profiled it and it was pointing at a function called redisplay_internal taking up almost all of the usage, but when I expanded it the sub-functions didn&#x27;t take up as much as redisplay_internal. Emacs -Q causes the redisplay_internal usage to drop considerably and the lag to go away. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has had this issue or if not how I could go about further dissecting what is going on since profiling didn&#x27;t lead me in the right direction.
 I have a sneaking suspicion doom modeline may be part of the issue since one of its functions has come up in the many profiling runs I&#x27;ve done. Disabling it seemed to help briefly, but redisplay_internal tends to stay higher than the emacs -Q profiling(in that it is lower than running M-x commands in cpu usage).
 EDIT: After singling out parts of my config it seems that doom-modeline is indeed the culprit. Any recommendations for a replacement that looks just as nice?

                              <span>subp.el is a generalization of some of the common code in straight.el and Elpaca. It offers several functions and macros for working with (syncrhonous, at the moment) sub-processes programmatically. e.g.
 (subp-cond (&quot;date&quot; &quot;-x&quot;) (success stdout) (failure stderr))

 but it didn&#x27;t work. Multiple cursors asked to insert text and delete text when I first installed and used it. Is it possible to automatically quiet this for the keybindings I defined?

                              <span>Hi community,
 I am a novice of Emacs and I am trying to config .emacs from scratch. Right now I configure a dozen of packages. I am a emacsclient user: I run emacs --fg-daemon with systemd user session and connect to emacs server through emacsclient (both GUI and TUI).
 The problem I am having now is: after running Emacs GUI client (v29.1 from Ubuntu 22.04 snap install) for a few hours, opening three dozons of buffers plus 1 LSP (gopls), I switched to Emacs client TUI. TUI hangs quickly (less than 1 sec) after connected to the server:
  
I see my active buffer of GUI in TUI for 0.5 sec &#x3D;&gt; based on my understanding, this should not happen: a new client should not render the active buffer of another client
 Emacs TUI switched to scratch
 Emacs TUI stopped unresponsive
 Open another Emacs GUI client and this instance worked fine
  
What&#x27;s the right way to debug this issue? Is there a way to dump the threads and stacks of the runtime? My hunch is LSP may be the problem. I hope to investigate before asking for more help.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I find light-blue-theme.el very easy to read. Now in emacs-29.1, every time I start emacs I am warned that it has been obsoleted.
 The code is almost completely unchanged since prior versions, except for the addition of the obsoleting flag.
 The commit is here:
 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el?h&#x3D;emacs-29&amp;id&#x3D;72491495e7b4b574f04fd18902c61dca84dcbc1b
 The commit message says:
 Obsolete the light-blue theme * etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el (light-blue): Make theme obsolete since it&#x27;s not maintained and seems to serve no particular use case (bug#47047).
 The code itself is here:
 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/themes/light-blue-theme.el?h&#x3D;emacs-29&amp;id&#x3D;72491495e7b4b574f04fd18902c61dca84dcbc1b
 The bug report was here, and frankly, I&#x27;m just not impressed that these couple of dudes decided it was okay to delete the theme because it was too hard to find a good face esp when they admitted they have absolutely no idea how many people use it.
 https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug&#x3D;47047
 I honestly don&#x27;t need any sort of themes or styles to be uber awesome, I just want to be able to read the damn screen for hours at a time, and light-blue did that for me.
 Can anyone help me understand what their issue in there thread is, and suggest a better face?
 At any rate, how do I suppress the warning message when loading that specific theme?

 When I try M-x set-menu-font I am able to select the font &quot;CaskadydiaCove Nerd Font Mono&quot; and it works perfectly with no errors

                              <span>On my journey through the lands of Haskell and GTK4, I once again encountered a problem I am not able to solve for myself, so I again hope for your help:
 I created a Gtk.DropDown from a list of text with Gtk.dropDownNewFromStrings [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;] and now I would like to retrieve its selected value:
 dropdown  (ManagedPtr o&#x27; -&gt; o&#x27;) -&gt; o -&gt; IO o&#x27; 
 And now it works:
 strObj &lt;- Gtk.castTo Gtk.StringObject selection -- :: Maybe StringObject

                              <span>Hi,
 My after-init-hook settings work fine when using Emacs in normal mode. Recently, I wanted to run my emacs in server mode and create a frame using a client. But the frame starts with a different font.
 lisp (setq-default initial-frame-alist &#x27;((fullscreen . maximized)) indent-tabs-mode nil default-terminal-coding-system &#x27;utf-8 select-active-regions nil) ) 
 I tried to move my font settings out of the initialization hook, but it makes no difference.
 I guess in server mode, emacs decide not to execute the font setting function because there&#x27;s nothing to display. But is there a way to tell it to execute the font settings when creating a frame?
 Another issue is that the frame starts in the *scratch* buffer. Is there&#x27;s way to make it start at the normal GNU welcome buffer?
 Thanks

                              <span>I recently decided to learn emacs and I was creating an &#x60;init.el&#x60; from scratch, but after adding eglot and corfu I found the auto-completion is super laggy. I&#x27;m testing it on a MacBook air m1 with 8G ram (I know, it&#x27;s a potato computer), I also tried neovim and even vscode just for comparison, and emacs appears to be the only one that is laggy.
 I just like to know if it&#x27;s normal, is it true that emacs requires more power to run?
 btw, I&#x27;m running emacs 29, I read some documents before starting to create &#x60;init.el&#x60;, and I know emacs has supported native compilation since 28, my understanding is it was enabled by default, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, thank you folks!

                              <span>The code for this sucks, I know. But here&#x27;s a tweak to my Emacs which I find so incredibly useful I want to share it with you. I call it &quot;electric M-m&quot;. Essentially, it makes M-m skip more than just whitespace. So it skips the //, # and ;; at the start of code comments, and also skips the *** TODO [1/10] at the start of Org mode headers. So it skips up to the first bit of proper text. By adding things to skip-prefixes-alist, you can extend this easily to more modes. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I&#x27;m happy with how it works.
 Anyway, here&#x27;s the code:
 (let ((c-like &#x27;(&quot;//+!?&quot; &quot;/?\\*+&quot;)) (lisp &#x27;(&quot;;+&quot;)) (org-header-regexp (rx bol (+ &quot;*&quot;) (+ space) ;; I know this is a filthy way of doing the keywords but I just can&#x27;t ;; be bothered to do it properly.

 unfortunately the majority of providers do not do so and it will be up to your client to filter things for you (most of clients does not provide such advanced search tho). although elfeed provides filtering syntax it does not allow having more advanced views of the feeds you are looking for.
 i recently built a self-hostable piece of software that takes an rss/atom feed as a parameter with some regex expression to filter titles, descriptions, content and authors. You can check it out here: https://rssc.fly.dev/. (git) (following describes how to use it with emacs elfeed but it’s client-agno…</span>

 I have gone though this tutorial, but it doesn&#x27;t explain anything and doesn&#x27;t show how to customise anything.

                              <span>I have a problem with sqlplus. 
 When started from emacs (via sql-oracle) it doesn&#x27;t display UTF-8 characters, instead it displays question marks. Queries with UTF-8 strings also don&#x27;t work. 
 When using sqlplus from console everything works as expected, but not from emacs. I tried set-buffer-process-coding-system to UTF-8 without success. 
 Any ideas how can I trace the problem?

                              <span>Most of the time, when looking for emacs alternatives, one often finds editors, but I think this is plain wrong. What I’m referring to here is whether there exists a platform, intepreter like emacs allowing applications to be written for it. It doesn’t have to be a Lisp interpreter, I’m interested to see any kind of similar approaches.

                              <span>As the emacs community converges on more modern feeling and well thought out UI systems (transient/hydra/vertico etc), org-mode&#x27;s bespoke and idiosyncratic way of popping up buffers to do things like select capture templates, select agenda commands and select TODO is starting to feel a bit long in the tooth and rough around the edges.
 It seems that others have had this thought as well:
 https://list.orgmode.org/orgmode/8c364693bf6856e60cdd3e8b63ab0c9284d16733.camel@heagren.com/
 https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/z8ugwj/wdyt_about_orgcapture_using_transientel/
 and in particular, it feels like transient might be an ideal candidate to provide a replacement for org-modes use cases.
 To that end I spent a bit of time making an org agenda transient, which can be found here:

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying out CDLaTeX, but I&#x27;m running into the problem that when typing e.g. &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; in text mode, I get:
  
cdlatex-math-modify: No such modifier ‘t’ outside math mode
  
I have a similar problem with &quot;I&#x27;m&quot;. These modifiers work fine in math mode, and typing e.g. &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; is fine too.
 If I show the list of available modifiers by &#x27;?, t and m are both there, with blanks next to them, which I presume should mean (as the documentation suggests) that &#x27;t should just produce &#x27;t - or should it actually be showing something nonempty?

                              <span>hi all,
 is it possible to change the time of an item from within the agenda?
 for example say you have the following in an org agenda file
 ** call Boss  
 i know you can change the date/time from the the .org file.
 you can also change the date from the agenda view.
 Is there a way to change the time (say from 11:50 to 11:55) from the agenda view?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having issues with this while using org-mode in doom emacs. I get Invalid function: org-element-with-disabled-cache while doing something like &quot;o to go to new line and INSERT&quot; or &quot;M-x org-cycle&quot;. After some searching I found this ((setq org-element-use-cache nil) should fix it, however that hasn&#x27;t really been the case. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s some kind of mistake in my config, I&#x27;d be glad if someone could look at it and tell me what&#x27;s up. I&#x27;m an Emacs noob, doubly so fo Elisp. Thanks
 My config.el:

                              <span>Sometimes it can be usefull to build a Set or a Map of STRef (to filter or group record pointing to the same ref). However, this is not possible because STRef doesn&#x27;t have an Ord instance.
 It is because it doesn&#x27;t make sense or just because people didn&#x27;t see the need for it ?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to tell you about the new version of the dotty-cps-async.
 The most significant thing in this release is introducing a compiler plugin with experimental support of direct context encoding. 
 // The idea of a direct context encoding is briefly described in 
 https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/BasicUsage.html#direct-context-encoding-experimental 
 This brings into the Scala API possibility to use a direct style model, similar to the Kotlin suspended function approach.
 Connected change: automatic coloring is deprecated in favor of the upcoming direct context encoding.

                              <span>I am getting started on using Zettelkasten. Here is one of my zettels, the purpose here is to capture concepts in Indian philosophy and discover connections. I look forward to your critiques/feedback:
In Indian philosophy, light can be understood as both physical and metaphysical. 

Prakasha refers to manifested light. There are three types: 
* ordinary fire (_jada agni_), 
* sunlight (_saura agni_), 
* lightning (_vaidyuta agni_).

The original spiritual light is _jyoti_. 

How does physical light interface with the metaphysical?
* Physical light sustains life on Earth, for example, sunlight provides energy through photosynthesis. 
* [[Prometheus stole fire and was punished for giving power to humans]]
* Light enables creation, as consciousness is the first element required.  
* Light is involved in metaphysical visions too:
1._Krishna_ grants _Arjuna_ a glimpse of his effulgent divine form, which _Sanjay_ also perceives through inner sight. 
2. The _Nachiketa_ and _Yama_ story conveys spiritual light&#x27;s ability to illuminate the knowledge of death and immortality.

 Warning: I am a relative noob, so I might say something stupid.
 I am trying to use tree-sitter and eglot, and setup as emacs as my IDE for python. Specifically, the minimum features I&#x27;d like to have are:
  
Syntax and variable highlighting, e.g., if I am using a variable it doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere, it should be highlighted, highlight functions with a color, etc.
 Completion of libraries, but also of variables, e.g., if the variable old_array exists, then I&#x27;d like to type &#x60;old&#x60; the hit tab (or something) and have emacs complete the rest.
 Also, something (like flymake) that highlights syntax errors

                              <span>My goal is to read a .csv file every time I export from org to markdown. Basically I want org to read a csv, convert it into a table, and export that table to markdown every time I export to md. This is what I have so far:
 #+name: code mytable #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :cache yes :exports both value (org-table-import &quot;example.csv&quot; &quot;,&quot;) #+END_SRC #+name: results mytable #+RESULTS: code mytable 
 ​
 If I execute the block while in org mode, it just puts the table inside of the src block. It also doesn&#x27;t execute the src block while exporting. Any ideas?

                              <span>I am aware that some programs, like flymake, are built in but you can install newer versions from GNU Elpa. Why is this the case? I mean for any third party package you can update it once it is ready to be updated. Why do built in packages not work the same way? If flymake has some new update why can&#x27;t you just get that updated at the same as the third party packages you have installed? Why do you have to either install a newer version of flymake from GNU Elpa or just wait for the new release of Emacs to access the newer version of flymake?

                              <span>Hello, are there any users here who extensively use graphical Emacs in WSL2 with WSLg? What steps have you taken to make the user experience as smooth as possible?
 So far, I&#x27;ve come across Bozhidar&#x27;s[1] post, which has been quite helpful. What&#x27;s currently bothering me the most are:
 1) Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts like &quot;Super + arrows&quot; for window manipulation. This is a known bug[2] across all WSLg applications due to the lack of support for this mechanism in non-native Windows&#x27; windows.
 2) The inability to open files in the Windows system using Emacs (WSL2). This is particularly frustrating for Org files, of which I have quite a few on my disk.
 3) Duplicate icon on the taskbar. I know it&#x27;s a minor issue, but it&#x27;s quite annoying. When I pin a shortcut for Emacs using &quot;Pin to taskbar,&quot; then open Emacs using the shortcut, it doesn&#x27;t &quot;overlay&quot; the pinned application. Instead, a new icon appears next to it.

                              <span>After transitioning from Mac to Windows, I tried to setup all my packages. It was about a month ago and I was delighted to see magit &quot;just work&quot; on Windows. However, a couple of days ago magit and project.el started behaving weirdly. I&#x27;ll ask about magit in this post.
 Whenever I ran &#x60;magit-status&#x60; inside a project, I got &#x60;process-lines-handling-status: Searching for program: No such file or directory, warning: unable to access &#x27;C:/Users/samvidmistry/.gitconfig&#x27;: Permission denied&#x60;. The full stacktrace is in the first screenshot. Upon some digging, I found that &#x60;magit-git-executable&#x60; was somehow set to &#x60;&quot;warning: unable to access &#x27;C:/Users/samvidmistry/.gitconfig&#x27;: Permission denied&quot;&#x60;.

                              <span>when I try out a Scala 3 macro, the inline definition of the macro itself with the Splicing, and the function which e.g. is using Quotations, when I compile this in sbt I get printed all macro println&#x27;s to the console at compile-time, as it is expected. When I switch to IntelliJ and the Scala plugin, those macro println&#x27;s are missing when I compile, and I looked into any log I could open, but could not find those macro println&#x27;s. Any idea how I could see those printlns in Intellij?

                              <span>Hi all :) I minimized my problem to this: 
 inline def recurser[T  Nil case t: (head *: tail) &#x3D;&gt; val h &#x3D; dispatcher(t.head) h :: recurser(t.tail) inline def dispatcher[T](inline t: T): String &#x3D; inline t match case t: Product &#x3D;&gt; val m &#x3D; summonInline[Mirror.ProductOf[T &amp; Product]] val tup &#x3D; Tuple.fromProductTyped(t)(using m) recurser(tup).mkString(&quot;[&quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;]&quot;) case _ &#x3D;&gt; t.toString 
 This compiles. However, calling dispatcher on a product type doesn&#x27;t: 
 dispatcher(1) // works dispatcher(1, 2, 3) // doesn&#x27;t :( 
 The compiler cannot perform the match in &#x60;recurser&#x60;: 
 cannot reduce inline match with scrutinee: tup : (tup : m.MirroredElemTypes) patterns : case _:EmptyTuple case t @ _:*:[head @ _, tail @ _] 
 Why is that? Everything seems precisely typed and inlined. Are there any workarounds? I know this particular example can be solved with givens, I&#x27;m exploring a given-less design space.

 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>I want to import Yaml and keep the order but the module Data.Yaml uses the Data.Aeson.Keymap type which is unordered. i only need the top level key-map to be ordered.
 What would be a decent way to preserve the order of my yaml file? Should I parse it for a second time and restore to get the order of my keys or can you think of a better approach?
 Edit:
 A solution is to create a list from the same file using this unreadable line of Haskell code:
 let keys &#x3D; map (fromText . Data.Text.init . decodeUtf8) . filter (not . isSpace . BS.head) . BS.lines $ content 
 where BS is my ByteString import. I can then later map over the keys list and lookup the yaml KeyMap in the right order.
 This solution feels a bit like a hack. So I wonder how you would solve this.
 Also, how would you make that huge line more readable?

Two reasons, first, frameworks simplify onboarding because you can now teach to the framework; the new programmer can be taught only the Haskell needed to operate the framework, and then &quot;proper&quot; Haskell later.
 ​
 We can do this already, but then you have to decide what dialect of Haskell you&#x27;re aiming to (there are TONS of Simple Haskells in use), and then get annoyed when new hires with Haskell experience get annoyed that your dialect doesn&#x27;t match their dialect.
 ​
 Second, I&#x27;ve compared a framework-centric approach to a keto-diet, in that it lets you cheat. Boring Haskell means to limit your use of language extensions to the absolutely &quot;crucial&quot;, which Boring Hask…</span>

 The issue is that the org--format-latex-make-overlay function doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. I thought that the new preview system centered previews by default, that has not been the case for me. How can I make this work? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>I tried turning on &#x60;lsp-ui-sideline-mode&#x60; and noticed that some entries in the sideline are split on two lines:
 https://preview.redd.it/e6dct4kqb4jb1.png?width&#x3D;1265&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;116651f45bdfd91df114422aadb515c4185d52a0
 I suspect what I&#x27;m seeing is what&#x27;s described in #285. However, the fix described there, to modify &#x60;markdown-code-face&#x60;,
  (custom-set-faces &#x27;(markdown-code-face ((t (:inherit default))))) 
 doesn&#x27;t make any difference.
 My font settings are
  (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;Iosevka&quot; :height 110 :weight &#x27;normal) (set-face-attribute &#x27;fixed-pitch nil :font &quot;Iosevka&quot; :height 110 :weight &#x27;normal) (set-face-attribute &#x27;variable-pitch nil :font &quot;Cantarell&quot; :height 110 :weight &#x27;regular) 
 Any suggestions what else to try?
 Could it be something related to my running a PGTK build?

                              <span>Just curious if anyone else is experiencing occasional lock up / freezing of Emacs 29.1. I&#x27;m on macOS and recently updated, and noticing it quite a bit. I&#x27;ve used it on my Debian laptop and haven&#x27;t noticed, so maybe it&#x27;s related to the build from brew.

What I was wondering is whether it is possible to configure it in such a way that it suggests words that contain the characters I have typed as a substring too?
 e.g. if i type &quot;ali&quot;, suggestions would include &quot;align&quot;, and &quot;left-align&quot; instead of just &quot;align&quot;

                              <span>For those running Windows, probably especially on laptops especially:
 Eli pushed changes aimed to fix at least one --maybe several-- scrolling bugs, and issued a general request for help testing. Especially, I think, from those with touchpads and heavily customized scrolling behavior.
 To test, rebuild from emacs-29 branch after 781ddd (so, since this morning around 09:00 CDT).
 Relatedly, I&#x27;ve stepped up my own pipeline for building Windows binaries. For the moment, I (try to) build after basically any push to &quot;release&quot; or &quot;development&quot; branches. (Treesitter grammer DLLs are still refreshed manually when I think of it.)

 I recently (very recently) got hooked on Doom EMACS, and from all the videos I&#x27;ve watched I see how powerful it is. I mainly want to use the org mode, and I encounter four major difficulties :
  
I don&#x27;t really know how to enter &quot;Insert mode&quot; in an ORG buffer, I just start typing random things until the cursor turns from a box to a line ;
 I don&#x27;t know how to type special characters like &#x3D; # &#x3D; on a buffer, cause Im on Mac and I need to press ALT+3, and that&#x27;s a keybinding to switch between workspaces;
 I can&#x27;t really press TAB to show/hide content of headlines, all it does is it adds an extra tabulation (Demoting the headline) ;
 I don&#x27;t know how to change the headline ticks.
  
Can someone please show me how to do all these things, cause Chat GPT is giving me some nonsense responses.

                              <span>Hello everyone,this would be my first post here I believe and as the title might suggest I am in the process of creating my own blog from scratch. Currently I just have a basic html and css file and it&#x27;s still very minimal but I am wondering if I should incorporate something like php to be able to make blog posts in markdown or org mode rather.
 I do not have very much experience in web dev but am pretty decent in other back end and system languages and find php to be sorta similar to bash. Creating a blog from scratch kinda seems like the long route to a simple solution but it&#x27;s more of a learning experience as well as having control over the skeletal structure and knowing whats behind everything. This will also give me control over the customization of the pages. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you 
 EDIT: After a few responses and reading over a couple tutorials I&#x27;ve learned you can basically build your own blog directly in Emacs. No php required ;)

                              <span>Hey there,
 So I&#x27;m in the process of figuring out how I can sync my phone notes to my local file server with Synching occasionally. Basically &#x27;phonenotes.org&#x27; from one machine to another. That being noted, I have another file called notes.org on my file server that basically lists completed tasks under a following format:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 *COMPLETED TASKS 2023
 ** Week of 08-14-2023
 *** Date
 Completed task summary
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 In my actual phone notes file, I have this for an example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Title: 08-15-2023
 Recorded music
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 With this in mind, how do I facilitate the ability to routinely ingest any of the notes that are date based on the phone note title itself from Orgzly so that it automatically determines the Monday of the given week, creates a &#x27;Week of (Starting Monday of that week)&#x27; subheading in the &#x27;notes.org&#x27; file and slams that new note in there?
 Sorry if it sounds complicated but I do this manually all the time and I wanted an easier way to do this programatically with Org Mode.
 Thanks!

Before plunging into the subject I wanted to reach out to the community and ask for good learning materials on the subject. I am aware of good resources on the subject itself, but I would like to get some Scala-first resources.
 Thank you for your help
 (Quick note: I made a couple of post on the subject of FP and backend in Scala. I appreciate all the comments provided by the community. Due to some issues I haven&#x27;t been able to digest all the information but I learned a lot from them. Right now I am working on a Minimum Viable Setup to learn as I work on my search engine. Thank you for the support.)

I think that THE key to zettelkasting is every zettel is a proxy for an idea, and the only thing that matters is zettel relatedness to other zettel. Discovery of the scaffolding of zettel relatedness is something that grows organically but can be nurtured as a gardener cares for her flowers, fruits, and veggies. Different strategies will tickle out the relatedness.
How to discover which zettel has the most pixie dust of magic at the moment. I&#x27;m getting further on my quest to weigh each zettel by measuring their use and connectivity.

                              <span>Hello r/Haskell community,
 I&#x27;ve recently embarked on my Haskell learning journey and have acquired the book &quot;Effective Haskell&quot;. However, as I want to delve deeper, I feel like I&#x27;m missing some of the mathematical foundations upon which functional programming is based. I don&#x27;t only want to know the HOW, but also the WHY.
 A bit about me: I&#x27;m currently in the 5th semester of Applied Computer Science, so I have a foundational understanding of mathematics. However, I&#x27;d like to bridge the gap between my current knowledge and what&#x27;s required to truly grasp the concepts in Haskell.
 Could any of you recommend books or resources that elucidate the mathematical principles essential for Haskell? I&#x27;m particularly interested in materials that would fit well with someone at my academic stage and can help me connect the dots between math and functional programming.
 Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

                              <span>Hello, I am trying to figure out a way to define an interactive function that:
  
Prompts a list of bibliography from a bibtex source file for selection.
 Based on the selected citation, populate an org-roam template involving the citation title, author names, etc.
  
I have tried to follow this guide which uses org-cite and citar, and got it somewhat working by modifying their org-roam-node-from-cite function, but I couldn&#x27;t get it working completely because there seems to have been some API changes in citar that broke the code as it is.
 I have also seen this guide using org-ref, but I would like to stick to the built-in org-cite if possible. Any help is appreciated, thanks!
 My current function modified from Kristoffer&#x27;s guide: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; Create a new node from a bibliographic source. taken from ;; https://jethrokuan.github.io/org-roam-guide/ (defun org-roam-node-from-cite (keys-entries) (interactive (list (citar-select-refs :multiple nil))) (let ((title (citar-format--entry (cdr &#x27;(keys-entries nil)) &quot;${author editor}${date urldate} :: ${title}&quot;))) (org-roam-capture- :templates &#x27;((&quot;r&quot; &quot;reference&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;references/${citekey}.org&quot; &quot;:properties: :roam_refs: [cite:@${citekey}] :end:

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using emacs centaur which is using project (and not projectile).
 For a small hello project, I could solve a first issue of LSP folder path :
 How to remind lsp-workspace-folder (+ to be used by DAP) ? : emacs (reddit.com) 
 Now, I&#x27;m on project with several sub folders with their own compile_commands.json, .git ....
 There is also a compile_commands.json on root, the most important.
 I created an empty .project file on root to try to solve the problem. I thought it should be the same that for .projectile. 
 I do project-switch-project and choose directory on root.
 I select the file I need with compile_commands.json on root.
 The LSP folder workspace is starting with compile_commands.json on a sub folder ... 
 Even with .project + (setq lsp-auto-guess-root t) in custom-post.el + remove compile_commands.json of the sub-folder used + delete of sub-folder with lsp-workspace-folder-remove + add of root with with lsp-workspace-folders-add
 I still have the sub-folder selected for project and lsp-workspace-folder ... 
 Please, if you have advice to solve this issue to force to declare a project directory and not auto-detect the git project of the file selected ?

 I usually open binary files with dired or from file: links in org mode. How can I make it so that these files are not opened in an Emacs buffer but instead are opened through an external Android App?

                              <span>I just found out that the first version of Microsoft Notepad was released in 1983. The first version of GNU Emacs was released a year later.
 However, Notepad still has pretty much the same functionality as the first version.
 I still use Notepad though - it is the only plain text editor I can use at work.

                              <span>I wonder why some Lisps like Scheme (and Ruby!) have the convention to add ? to predicate functions, but Elisp doesn&#x27;t.
 E.g. (equal? ...) or (is-number? ...) or some such.
 And here&#x27;s the type predicate page for some actual Elisp samples: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Type-Predicates.html
 Anyone recall a (maybe historic) reason for this?

                              <span>Hi people,
 After months of previous attempt on using DOOM Emacs, I&#x27;m trying to give Emacs a new try but this time with my own configuration and no Evil in the mix.
 I saw the fantastic news about the Emacs 29.1 major version, like having Eglot and Treesit built-in; so I decided to give it a try, but unfortunately no success :( 
 When I run the treesit-install-language-grammar I receive the following error.
  Warning (treesit): Error encountered when installing language grammar: (file-missing Setting current directory No such file or directory /tmp/treesit-workdir1YJ0sh/repo/src) 
 After checking the temporary folder I could find that is empty, seems like not even the git clone is executed.
 Anyone already faced this issue and was able to solve, or have any idea of what is happening.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 ​
 I just found out about this function to detangle from the source code to the main org file. However, I cannot do this in my configuration (doom-emacs), having an error message saying that 0 code blocks were detangled. I am using the &#x60;:comments link&#x60; option as well.
 When I tried launching emacs with -Q flag, it didn&#x27;t find this function. 
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar issue? Does anyone use it?
 I didn&#x27;t find any alternative to this feature as well.
 ​
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I am using Emacs to edit files in a computer in my network over ssh. However, this has been very painful because I sometimes lose connection (for example if put my Emacs into sleep mode) and then Tramp freezes emacs and I see a message: &quot;Tramp: Openning connection nil for HOSTNAME&quot;
 I then have to kill emacs and restart.
 Is there a way to make Tramp more robust to connections dropping?

                              <span>I&#x27;m on Windows 10 btw.
 I&#x27;m following this tutorial for Clojure: https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/
 I follow these instructions:
 Do the following to delete your existing Emacs configuration and install the Clojure-friendly one:
  
Close Emacs.
 Delete ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d if they exist. (Windows users, your emacs files will probably live in C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\. So, for example, you would delete C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d.) This is where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
 Download the Emacs configuration zip file listed above and unzip it. Its contents should be a folder, emacs-for-clojure-book1. Run mv path/to/emacs-for-clojure-book1 ~/.emacs.d.
 Open Emacs.
  
When you open Emacs, you may see a lot of activity as Emacs downloads a bunch of useful packages.
 I am able to complete the steps, however I see no activity and nothing being downloaded when I reopen EMACS. Just the regular EMACS screen with the logo.
 Anyone know what I am doing wrong ?
 Here is the file I moved to the .emacs.d folder per the tutorial

                              <span>Hello fellow Emacs fanatics users.
 I recently installed CGit on my personal server, and noticed the lack of Org mode support for the &quot;about&quot; pages. So, I decided to write a script and share it.

                              <span>As I remeber, correct way to make a configuration file is to put next into init.el:
 (require &#x27;org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;init.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) 
 But now in Emacs 28.2 I&#x27;m getting next error:
 error: Recursive load, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el, /home/kereell/.emacs.d/init.el 
 https://pastebin.com/CDjLseT2 - Here is my init.org. What&#x27;s wrong with that? It is actually was &quot;working&quot; configuration untill one day it stoped.
 P.S.: Actually it behave weird after deleting all tmp files and reboot it literaly takes all the configuration from the init.org and putting it into init.el replacing the:
 (require &#x27;org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;init.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) 
 Is that a bug or new feature in emacs 28.2 or I doing anything wrong?

I installed the language server and see the folders and all but treesitter can&#x27;t find them I&#x27;m using an emacs folder not emacs.d. is there&#x27;s a variable I can set in my config to point treesiter to the right file path. An example would be helpful too as I&#x27;m new to elisp and new to programming. Thanks

                              <span>For one of the things I work on I use emacs exclusively in a terminal over an ssh session rather than through the GUI. I am developing C++ and recently switched from a ycmd setup to using eglot with a more recent clangd. And there&#x27;s one thing it does that I want it to not do, but I can&#x27;t identify the name of the behavior to google for how to configure it off (or if it&#x27;s attributable to eglot or one of the other modes that eglot interacts with).
  
const auto sources: const std::set &#x3D; get_filtered_sources(config, source_options);
  
The text I&#x27;m rendering here with strikethrough isn&#x27;t struck through on my terminal, but it&#x27;s rendered in a different text color and it&#x27;s always displayed, but isn&#x27;t part of the text of the buffer. When I declare a variable with auto it will annotate it with the type of the variable. Or when I call a function it will sometimes tag the names of the arguments like so:
  
config.get(tag: &quot;the_key_sought&quot;);
  
I would like it to not do this - these annotations unconditionally inserting itself into the flow of text pushes things out of alignment, makes rectangular yank more confusing, etc.
 Does anyone know the name of this behavior or (even better) how to configure my eglot+clangd setup to not do this? Having these annotations appear only on request would be ideal, but having them not appear at all (while not disabling eglot completely) would be a big improvement.

 I&#x27;m new to emacs, I switched over to it mostly because of org-mode. Most things are working perfectly, except for the icons in org-mode, and perhaps all icons? I&#x27;m not really sure since its the first time I use doom emacs. This is how my org files look:
 my current org-mode
 I checked for the all-the-icons font, and apparently it&#x27;s installed corrently:

 And here&#x27;s my doom doctor output:
 doom doctor output
 I did M-x doom/reload and doom sync, restarted emacs, and it still doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve done M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts too. Does anybody know how to fix this?
 Here&#x27;s my fetch if that helps in any way:

 For clarification, I want my org files to look like this:

                              <span>I have a literate configuration named &quot;custom-init.org,&quot; which is loaded in the init.el file as follows:
 ;; Load the Emacs Lisp code blocks embedded in the literate Org file (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;~/.emacs.d/custom-init.org&quot;)) 
 I&#x27;ve noticed that some people use a different loading strategy, where they directly load the Emacs Lisp file if it&#x27;s available. However, this approach isn&#x27;t any faster than using org-babel-load-file in my opinion:
 (if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name &quot;config.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (load-file (expand-file-name &quot;config.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;custom-init.org&quot; user-emacs-directory))) 
 org-babel-load-file only auto-tangles during startup when it detects a modification; otherwise, it loads the cached stuff.
 The fact that Emacs initially loads the init.el file and then needs to access a different file, regardless of the method used, is what introduces a speed penalty.
 I was thinking about giving up on the Org literate setup, but right now, I don&#x27;t have much time to redo my Emacs configuration in plain Emacs Lisp. I know there are cool stuff like the outshine mode, etc.. However, I&#x27;m wondering if there might be another way. Maybe there&#x27;s a way to have Org mode directly add everything tangled into the &quot;init.el&quot; file? That would make Emacs load much faster without the need of a server/client thing.
 Also, do you think Org really adds a layer of unnecessary abstraction for a literate config, to the point where I should think about giving up at some stage? I&#x27;ve been considering whether the effort is justified if it&#x27;s working well.

                              <span>Struggling here - even with ChatGPT.
 I want to close any helm/projectile dialog when I push ESC.
 This is what I have:
 (with-eval-after-load &#x27;helm-projectile
 (define-key helm-map (kbd &quot;ESC&quot;) &#x27;helm-keyboard-quit)
 (define-key helm-find-files-map (kbd &quot;ESC&quot;) &#x27;helm-keyboard-quit)
 (define-key helm-projectile-recentf-map (kbd &quot;ESC&quot;) &#x27;helm-keyboard-quit)
 ) 
 Which works for helm when I just go to open a file, but not when I use helm-projectile (helm-projectile-recentf-map is undefined - is there another way to define keys)?

                              <span>Hej fellows &#x27;macsers,
 I am trying to get CAPE-powered CAPFS going when editing common lisp files. After starting a thread on the working of CAPFS and CAPE, I understood that essentially you need to write a helper function that adds the desired CAPEs in a particular mode, because completion-at-point-functions gets buffer-local values that override its global value.
 Fine and dandy, I did that for modes such as emacs-lisp-mode, lisp-interaction-mode and slime-repl-mode just fine, even those including cape-company-to-capf. Find one (working!) example below: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun or/cape-capfs-slime-repl-mode () (dolist (e (list #&#x27;cape-file (cape-company-to-capf #&#x27;company-slime))) (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions e)))
 (use-package cape :hook (slime-repl-mode . or/cape-capfs-slime-repl-mode))…</span>

                              <span>I am wondering if it&#x27;s possible to use Eglot with Emacs&#x27;s built-in indentation and respect the language server&#x27;s indentation everywhere. Of course I could use eglot-format to reindent the entire buffer upon save. But when editing the file,  still uses the major mode&#x27;s indentation settings.
 I&#x27;m writing C++ code and use a .clang-format to control the project code style, which Eglot uses through Clang. I tried to write a eglot-indent-line function and bind it to indent-line-function, as described here. But like the linked email said, simple things like (newline) doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I am trying add a time, not a time stamp to an entry.
 an inactive timestamp includes the date and time [2020-10-10 Wed 11:33]. 
 I would like to shorten it to just the time to 11:33 because I am using it in datetree format
 does anyone have any experience with this?

 This is a example from my code:

                              <span>Minimal example: I have a Cabal project with the following structure:
 Test Test.cabal Test.hs 
 The code file:
 {- Description: Description. * Description -} module Test (test) where -- | Test. test :: Int test &#x3D; 0 
 The cabal file:
 cabal-version: 3.8 author: Liisi Kerik category: Test description: Description. name: Test synopsis: Synopsis. version: 0.0.0 library build-depends: base exposed-modules: Test ghc-options: -Wall 
 cabal haddock works but I get a warning:
 Warning: The documentation for the following packages are not installed. No links will be generated to these packages: base-4.18.0.0, ghc-bignum-1.3, ghc-prim-0.10.0 100% ( 2 / 2) in &#x27;Test&#x27; Warning: Test: could not find link destinations for: - GHC.Types.Int 
 and the resulting html documentation contains no link to the documentation of Int.
 I&#x27;m on Windows 10, GHC 9.6.2, Cabal 3.10.1.0.
 If there&#x27;s no easy way to link documentation, then is there at least some way to silence the warning, since it gets extremely verbose even when developing a tiny package?

 Another thing I remember using was sort of eval-last-sexpr-and-insert-result-as-comment. Is there a package for doing that with elisp too?

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m making the transition from Neovim to Emacs, and now I&#x27;m working on setting up the Emacs configuration file using org-mode. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done for that:
 I&#x27;ve created an init.el file with the following contents:
 (require &#x27;org) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;config.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) 
 And here&#x27;s the content of the config.org file:
 * Configuration #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (menu-bar-mode -1) (tool-bar-mode -1) #+END_SRC 
 Both of these files are located in the ~/.config/emacs directory.
 However, the config.org file doesn&#x27;t seem to be sourced in the init.el file, and I&#x27;m not quite sure why. I&#x27;ve watched a couple of YouTube videos and visited some websites, and I&#x27;m following the exact steps they&#x27;re showing, but it&#x27;s not working for me.
 Could you folks assist me in figuring out what I might be doing wrong here?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing with Emacs 29&#x27;s native tree-sitter for indentation and other ideas. First impression: it&#x27;s really so very powerful compared to the bad old days of regexp matching and even ppss. It just understand the code. So far so good.
 That said, I&#x27;ve been trying to assess performance impact for applications that run frequently, e.g. via font-lock. Finding node at point is insanely fast: a fraction of a µs. But to my surprise, tree-sitter actions like &quot;find all parent nodes starting from the current node&quot; tend to vary in duration from (still very fast) 2–10µs to hundreds of µs or even several ms, depending on where the search starts from. I certainly expect some variability as you navigate from different depths within the syntax tree, but repeatable factors of 1000 seems a bit extreme, and make it hard to predict performance for latency-sensitive code.
 Does anyone have insight into this performance variability? Do you experience it as well? Perhaps it depends on the parser backend (I&#x27;ve tried only python so far)? Or is it fundamental to the TS algorithm?
 An example simple code to try, from various code locations in a large-ish file:
 (benchmark-run 100000 (let ((n (treesit-node-at (point) &#x27;python))) ; or whichever language you have (while n (setq n (treesit-node-parent n))))) 
 Multiply the result by 10 and that is the number of µs each &quot;navigate up from node&quot; operation takes.

 I never used it with Emacs before. But today I realized that it do not work.
 I do use Emacs 27 on Debian 11 with evil-mode.
 Why is Emacs an exception here? What is the technical reason behind it?
 Can I activate it somehow? How can I type Japanese in Emacs?

                              <span>Hey all, I found out about midnight-mode which is a minor mode that runs whatever functions are added to its hook. The hook is called midnight-hook unsurprisingly, and it will run this every time it hits midnight. This by itself is a little handy tool but the part that i really like is that it comes with a function called clean-buffer-list which you can probably guess what it does ;)
 I don&#x27;t use midnight mode specifically but I do use clean-buffer-list since I found out about it. 
 I made a YouTube video for those interested. I also have a playlist called Emacs Goodies that is the video format of TIL in which I have a few videos lined up. - Midnight Mode - Emacs Goodies Playlist

Removing elc files from org-roam didn&#x27;t help
 tried to remove the sqlite database: no success
 upgrade packages didn&#x27;t change anything
 tried different sqlite3 libraries doesn&#x27;t work
  
[SOLVED]
 Ok, after some other attempts, I find a solution.
  
I changed the melpa repository to the melpa instead of melpa-stable;
 this allowed me to install emacsql-sqlite-builtin package
 I added the instructions  (use-package emacsql-sqlite-builtin) (setq org-roam-database-connector &#x27;sqlite-builtin) 
  
Now org-roam works.
 Thank you all for your help: I hope this will be useful in the future

                              <span>Hey! I am learning to use postgresql-simple by building a little website.
 Currently my functions to get data from the database live inside IO [a] where a is a type I am using to model my data.
  getPostById :: Connection -&gt; Int -&gt; IO [Post] getPostById conn x &#x3D; query conn &quot;SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id &#x3D; ?&quot; (Only x) 
 I have read that if something bad happens, postgresql-simple throws exceptions such as &quot;FormatError&quot; if the format of the query is no valid SQL. link: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.7.0.0/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple.html#g:13
 What I would like is using IO (Either Text Post) as a return type (so when any exception is thrown, it will get returned as a Left err).
 Is this possible? Is this an antipattern? How else would I handle the exceptions..? I assumed in Haskell it is common to use Maybe or Either to model exceptions/errors and am somewhat surprised about exceptions here.
 Appreciate any help!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve run into a nice use case for some GADTs using GHC.TypeNats in a project, but I&#x27;m having trouble getting anything to typecheck. Specifically, I&#x27;ve isolated the following example:
 data Foo (n :: Nat) where FooZ :: Foo 0 FooS :: Foo n -&gt; Foo (n+1) fooMax :: Foo n -&gt; Foo m -&gt; Foo (max n m) fooMax FooZ x &#x3D; x fooMax x FooZ &#x3D; x fooMax (FooS x) (FooS y) &#x3D; FooS (fooMax x y) 
 (In my actual use case I have some data structure where n encodes a kind of depth, and I want a &quot;merge&quot; function which produces a structure whose depth is the maximum of the depths, but I think the above reproduces my issues quite well.)
 This fails to typecheck, since ghc doesn&#x27;t infer that max n 0 ~ n, max 0 n ~ n, and max n1 n2 + 1 ~ max n m given n ~ n1+1 and m~n2+1. I&#x27;ve played with agda in the past, where the solution would be to pass along some kind of witnesses to these relations constructed via induction over the structure of Nat, but here I&#x27;m a bit stumped, since as far as I can tell GHC.TypeNats and the operations on them are not built via Peano axioms.
 Can anyone shed some light on how one would go about convincing GHC of the above?

                              <span>I played around with GADTs and realized that data constructor definitions look really confusing to me:
 data Term a where IntTerm :: Int -&gt; Term Int BoolTerm :: Bool -&gt; Term Bool SumTerm :: Term Int -&gt; Term Int -&gt; Term Int EqTerm :: (Show x) &#x3D;&gt; Term x -&gt; Term x -&gt; Term Bool 
 The main reason is that they just look like function type definitions, I do not define their &quot;implementation&quot; anywhere. Yet they can be used at runtime and somehow construct values of the type Term a.
 Is it correct to say that a definition like
 EqTerm :: (Show x) &#x3D;&gt; Term x -&gt; Term x -&gt; Term Bool 
 ultimately means something like &quot;at runtime store a tuple of (ADT tag for EqTerm, x, x), call it EqTerm in pattern matching, and for type checking assume that this value has type Term Bool and that the contents implement Show&quot;?
 And also, does using a GADT prevent some optimizations that could be possible for a regular ADT, like storing unboxed representation of contents?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, I’m hoping to start interviewing for Scala engineering positions, but I’m wondering about the best way to actually interview for those positions.
 The issue that I’m having is that I am able to solve LeetCode questions quite easily with an imperative style of Scala code. When it comes to the functional approach… I just really struggle to come up with idiomatic solutions in a reasonable amount of time.
 How important is it when interviewing for Scala positions to code in a functional style?
 I’ve read about half of the red book (and have done the problems)… but I just don’t code quickly in the functional paradigm.

                              <span>I am a math grad student who has been looking for personal knowledge management solutions, and a while back I posted here on my use case. Many people recommended Org Roam, so I took the plunge and have been very happy with that decision. I&#x27;ve used roam to learn new things and better organize and consolidate what I do know, and the results have been excellent so far.
 I&#x27;m now trying to extend my system to handle problem sheets and exercises. When I&#x27;m working through a math book, I&#x27;d like to record of the exercises I solve.
 So for example, if I was working through Hartshorne&#x27;s Algebraic Geometry, I&#x27;d like to be able to create a node/org file &quot;Solutions to Hartshorne.org&quot; with the chapter titles as headlines and in each headline I&#x27;d have environments like:
 #+begin_problem
 Give an example of an irreducible polynomial f in R[x, y], whose zero set Z(f) is not irreducible.
 #+end_problem
 #+begin_solution
 BLAH BLAH
 #+end_solution
 What I&#x27;m hoping for is a good, lightweight LaTeX package or class defining such environments that I can include in the header or setup files so that I can export my org file to PDF and get a nice solution manual. I&#x27;d prefer to be able to easily customize the solution numbering to match that of different books i.e. alphabetical, roman, numbers etc. I&#x27;d also like to handle problems with multiple parts well. I&#x27;m not too worried about the other aspects of the formatting.
 I realize this may be more of a LaTeX question, but hopefully I can get some advice here on how to set up the kind of system I want. Any help or suggestions for a better setup would be very appreciated.

 They pass everything around as Options in a Monix task. I&#x27;m trying to pull it apart to get at the data but am struggling. I&#x27;m guessing I need to somehow ?evaluate it? but just can&#x27;t find the right combinations of {} flatmaps, for comprehensions, etc :(

                              <span>Hi, I want to get familiar with functional programming in Scala.
 A year ago I tried Elixir and I really liked it. It was simple, immutable, and has no special syntax for side effects. This made it very approachable and I really liked it. When I was trying to learn Haskell I struggled to understand the concept of a Monad. I understand that concepts like Maybe(Haskell) and Result(Rust) are monads but I used them only as Higher Kinded types and had a very intuitive(as opposed to formal) understanding of what they do. I think of them mostly as tags added to a primitive type. Like type Email &#x3D; Email String (as a quick example), where we say that an Email is a special type of string. Btw I always wanted to add validations to a type of this sort but never figured out how. Something like type Ema…</span>

                              <span>I installed emacs 29.1 from the homebrew cask on both my personal iMac (intel based) and my work macbook (M2). The M2 version is working flawlessly so far, but the Intel version is being very wonky. When performing various simple operations (such as scrolling) it very often completely blanks out the screen for a few seconds and then returns. What&#x27;s worse, is that quite frequently, it gets in a state in which it won&#x27;t respond to any key sequence (not even C-g), and needs to be force quit. They are both running the same init.el files and using the same packages, and both are running the latest version of Ventura. I never had any of these problems before upgrading to 29.1. Any suggestions?

 It would allow you not only to format your statements, but go to the end of a line C-j would send the statement and show you results in a seperate buffer. Really nice for constructing sql statements.
 I can&#x27;t find that mode, can someone help?

 However, there is one thing I simply don&#x27;t understand, and it relates to the Cape package. The example use-package-declaration features both :bind forms as well as (add-to-list &#x27;completion-at-point-functions #&#x27;cape-\*) forms.
 So far, I&#x27;ve understood it as :bind forms are there to invoke a specific CAPF while add-to-list forms are there to populate something like a pool from which completion-at-point can choose an according backend when prompted.
 However, there is two things that don&#x27;t conform with this inte…</span>

But in my new config, I only copy/delete four lines start from the current cursor position. Please help me with it. Thank everyone.

                              <span>A few days ago someone on discourse came with an interesting way of using (or abusing?) the block argument extension which allows this 
 example &#x3D; fmap do \x → x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] 
 to compile. Basically it allows to use do to replace $ or parenthesis. Beside the fact that it can be a good idea or not it makes me look at the BlockArgument doc.
 I&#x27;ve learn a few usefull stuff. 
  
The grammar is ambiguous regarding the extent of lambda abstractions, let expressions, and conditionals. The ambiguity is resolved by the meta-rule that each of these constructs extends as far to the right as possible.
  
The &quot;as far to the right as possible&quot; means that we don&#x27;t need the second do.
 so
 example2 &#x3D; fmap do \x -&gt; x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] 
 shoud work and does !. Also 
  
They include do, lambda, if, case, and let expressions.
  
So we shouldn&#x27;t need the first do because lambda does the same job.
 example3 &#x3D; fmap \x -&gt; x^2 + 1 [1, 2, 3] 
 But it doesn&#x27;t compile.
 Neither does
 example4 &#x3D; fmap \x -&gt; x^2 + 1 do [1, 2, 3] 
 So my question why is that example2 works but example3 and exapmle4 don&#x27;t ? Is it a bug or am I misunderstanding the doc ?

                              <span>I realized today that the most general callCC type is the following:
 newtype Cont r a &#x3D; Cont {runCont :: (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r} callCC :: ((forall b. a -&gt; Cont r b) -&gt; Cont r a) -&gt; Cont r a callCC f &#x3D; Cont \k -&gt; runCont (f \a -&gt; Cont \_ -&gt; k a) k 
 The &quot;exit&quot; argument never returns, so it should have arbitrary return type, like any other Haskell function that never returns. Equivalently, it could return Cont r Void. 
 After a quick search I found that the above type was already suggested in 1991. What&#x27;s the reason behind the current callCC type in Haskell? Is it just because of the lack of RankNTypes or Void support from when it was introduced? Or maybe the more general type is problematic in MonadCont for some reason?

                              <span>I want to build a GTK4/Libadwaita application and I wonder if it was a reasonable idea to do that in Haskell.
 The Haskell GTK4 binding seem to be maintained (https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi), however there is not much activity and no documentation at all – all the documentation is about GTK3. The only GTK4 app I could find was ghcup-gtk a project in a very early stage.
 So I wanted to ask you if you think that there is any sense in trying to build a GTK4 app in Haskell or should I just move on and learn Rust? I’m still learning Haskell and never did any bigger project with it, but after I’ve seen the delightful world of pure functional programming the imagination of writing imperative code kind of depresses me, you know what I mean?
 Do you know any GTK4/Haskell apps? Have you ever tried to build one? What do you think?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve been reading a bit about the new primops for delimited continuations that enable for efficient algebra effects but I don&#x27;t have a strong understanding of them yet.
 I was wondering if it would be possible to implement something more like the usual callCC using them to capture the current continuation in the IO monad? I&#x27;m imagining a function with a type callCC :: ((a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; IO b) -&gt; IO b (modulo some prompt tags) but this seems quite far removed from the provided control0 :: PromptTag a -&gt; ((IO b -&gt; IO a) -&gt; IO a) -&gt; IO b primitive.

                              <span>This may be a controversial topic, and I know not everyone is keen on iOS. Having said that, there are plenty of Emacs/org users who are also iPhone users. This post is for Emacs/org users who are happy with this hybrid world of sorts.
 I&#x27;m the author of plainorg.com and have had a fair number of users requesting agenda capabilities (scheduling, custom filters, multi-file support, different kinds of views, syncing, the list goes on). The thing is, building great and polished experiences like these for org on iOS (and anywhere) does require non-trivial effort with lots of iterations to get to that great experience.
 How would you realistically kickstart it and fund it (adverts are not an option)?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m playing around with awesomewm. My experience would be drastically improved if lsp would be able to show completions, documentations and definitions from awesome libraries. I thought adding awesome library path to LUA_PATH would make lsp recognize the path and scan it, and be able to autocomplete and other things with it, like it does with the default or local libraries. Is there a way to make it recognize and process the awesome libraries?

 TL;DR Questions
  
How do I prevent an update from bringing back these unused variables if I fix it? Do I have to fork it? Is there a way to fork it and allow updates to still offer themselves to me so I can use a diff/patch sort of thing? 
 
Why do you think the author included those variables if they&#x27;re unused? Did they just forget? If you can help me figure out what they were intending to do, I&#x27;d like to put the variables to use or just delete the lines with the variable declarations.
 
 Background
 I just started playing with emacs, but I downloaded some evil mode packages because I mainly use vim. To that end, I installed evil-tex. It gave me a bunch of docstring wider than 80 characters warnings, so I did M-x find-library RET evil-tex and broke up all docstrings …</span>

 Has anyone else noticed this? ... when moving the cursor up or down (without changing the column) sometimes (not always) doom-modeline fails to update the line number. Doesn&#x27;t matter how long I wait, it doesn&#x27;t update.
 If I turn off doom-modeline, it all works again (just not so pretty).
 It&#x27;s not one of the laggy issues documented on the doom-modeline github page as the line number is never updated (ie not just slow). Also, I tried those fixes and it&#x27;s happening on local files, not tramp.
 When the column is updated (left or right movement) both line numbers and column numbers are both updated correctly.
 This is emacs-pgtk-29.1_2 and doom-modeline-20230811.236

 I can&#x27;t figure out whether to use the customize interface to set options, or elisp instead. It seems like its super easy to quickly set options and faces using customize, but not everything can be set using it, so then I need to figure out when to use it vs elisp.
 It sounds like you can also customize a lot using just use-package. I was thinking of putting all settings related to a package in its use-package declaration, then using customize for emacs built-in options and faces. Then maybe I could use elisp for hooks, functions, and more complicated customizations.
 What do you folks recommend?

                              <span>How come some changes I make to my .el config files can be changed and taken into effect after &#x27;eval-buffer&#x27;, but some not? I have a subfolder &#x27;settings&#x27; with mode/package specific settings that are loaded into my init file.
 Say I add a new keybinding to my *keybindings.el* in the &#x27;settings&#x27; directory:
 ;; new binding (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c a&quot;) &#x27;org-agenda) (use-package which-key :init (which-key-mode) :diminish which-key-mode :config (setq which-key-idle-delay 2)) (provide &#x27;key-bindings) 
 And in my *init.el* file I have this:
 (setq settings-dir (expand-file-name &quot;settings&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (add-to-list &#x27;load-path settings-dir) 
 Having added the keybinding and run *eval-buffer* inside the *keybindings.el* buffer, I can use the binding right away. If I however remove it from *keybindings.el* and eval-buffer again, it persist.
 What gives here? It seems that generally removing bindings isn&#x27;t able to be affected by evaluation since I&#x27;m able to change the keybinding illustrated above from &quot;C-c a&quot; to &quot;C-c p&quot; and the new binding works, but the old binding appears to still be bound to the function.

                              <span>using the vhdl-basic-offset is 4, my entity looks like this:
 entity tutorial_led_blink is port ( i_clock : in std_logic; i_enable : in std_logic; i_switch_1 : in std_logic; i_switch_2 : in std_logic; o_led_drive : out std_logic ); end tutorial_led_blink; 
 Everything here looks good using the vhdl-mode Beautify feature, except for one thing, and that is the closing parenthesis. How can I change the closing parenthesis to be in alignment with the word port, so it looks like the following?
 entity tutorial_led_blink is port ( i_clock : in std_logic; i_enable : in std_logic; i_switch_1 : in std_logic; i_switch_2 : in std_logic; o_led_drive : out std_logic ); end tutorial_led_blink; 
 I&#x27;m also using both vhdl-mode and vhdl-ext, thanks

                              <span>Hi, I am working on a project and I need to write a backend in Scala. I was thinking of using Scalatra but I read some posts and received some feedback indicating that Scala devs prefer a different stack. I remember encountering something like this in the Rust community where backends written in Rust often don&#x27;t use ORMs ( but there are ORMs available).
 Despite my best efforts, I keep finding new frameworks mentioned here in Reddit that I couldn&#x27;t find searching on my own. I&#x27;ve also noticed that a lot of articles about Scala are kind of old. How do you keep up with new libraries/frameworks? So I want to reach out to the community and ask: what kind of stack would you use as a backend?
 I am familiar with Postgresql, but it might be the case that in the Scala community there is a special DB framework (like Datomic is for Clojure). I like Functional Programming but I don&#x27;t want to use monads. I settle with a simple flavor of FP(like Elixir). I&#x27;ve read that effects are easier to use over monads and that Scala has support for effects but I am unfamiliar with the subject. Is it the standard library or is it an external library.
 Thank you for your time

                              <span>How do you best combine these?
 I can&#x27;t figure out whether to use the customize interface to set options, or elisp instead. It seems like its super easy to quickly set options and faces using customize, but not everything can be set using it, so then I need to figure out when to use it vs elisp
 It sounds like you can also customize a lot using just use-package. I was thinking of putting all settings related to a package in its use-package declaration, then using customize for emacs built-in options and faces. Then maybe I could use elisp for hooks, functions, and more complicated customizations.
 What do you folks recommend?

 In short, I am trying to achieve a kind of filter and then map effect on Either type based on my parsing result in a same function. This helps me avoid using partial function or duplication of pattern matching for sum types. Example:
 identifierTokenParser :: TokenParser (String, Int, Int) identifierTokenParser &#x3D; first toParseError $ symMaybeMap getVal where getVal Info {val &#x3D; Identifier str, startRow &#x3D; row, startCol &#x3D; col} &#x3D; Just (str, row, col) getVal _ &#x3D; Nothing 
 If here I have used symIf and then fmap kind of thing then there should have been another pattern matching that was fully redundant.
 Just to give context I am pattern matching on programming language tokens:
 data Token &#x3D; Illegal | Identifier String | Integer String | StringVal String | -- Symbols Comma | Semicolon .... 
 I became curious if it is some standard technique we use and is there any mathematical structure hidden behind this?
 I am quite new to haskell so not sure of Haskell standard patterns.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have recently started using OpenAI-based MacWhisper to dictate notes. Perhaps many of you have used dictation for your notes, but I find that Whisper has extremely high quality and gets things like punctuation, hyphenation, capitalization and so forth correct even with my strongly Indian accent. One of the benefits I have seen from doing this is that my notes have become somewhat more conversational than before. I find this to be a benefit rather than something bad, because it seems to be capturing what I am thinking now somewhat better. Perhaps this conversational tone of the note might be more relatable a few years down the line, but that is just a guess.
All the whisper models of all sizes are free but Macwhisper provides a free way of accessing these for the three smallest models. If you want to use the larger models you have to pay a one-time fee of $20 to make that possible. Perhaps other free tools even with the large models will become available soon. In terms of privacy, one of the good things here is that the model is sitting on your computer so the data never leaves the computer and it seems safe even for private notes for that reason.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to create links to inline latex equation in org mode in a way that makes the referenced equation obvious just from looking at it, without actually following the link.
 Let me clarify this a bit. When I write a latex file, I can create an equation with a label &quot;myeq&quot;. Then when I compile the document, the equation is going to appear with a number next to it, and if I reference &quot;myeq&quot; in the text, the reference is going to turn into hyperlink with the number of the equation.
 In contrast, the closest thing I can do in org mode, is adding a #+NAME property to the equation, and referencing it with a standard org-mode link. This translates nicely to latex links if I export it to latex, however, it is sort-of inconvenient if I look at the file in org-mode because the #NAME property disappears when I compile the latex fragments, so I can&#x27;t tell which equation a given link is pointing to without following it.
 Any ideas how to solve this problem?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using ido-mode for many years now.
 Fido-mode seems like it might be more supported these days, especially since it also seems to apply to completing reads out-of-the-box, whereas I have horrible hacks in my init.el to use ido-mode too that way. And it seems to be a bit better about showing hints or supporting information than ido-mode. (E.g., showing me the character too and not just the unicode name when I tab-complete in C-x 8 RET.)
 But I can&#x27;t find an equivalent for how ido-mode will cache files and directories that I find things in (and save this in ~/.ido.last), and then, if I C-x C-f and start typing a file name that isn&#x27;t in the current directory but is in a cached file or directory, it will show the message &quot;Searching for foo...&quot; and then jump right to offering it after a brief pause (the ido-auto-merge-delay-time, I believe).
 Is there an equivalent to this for fido-mode? I looked at recentf-mode, but it seems like it&#x27;s separate functionality that must be manually invoked, rather than being able to integrate into fido-mode and provide smart filename completion support automatically.
 Am I missing something? Or should I just continue to stay on ido-mode? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am a newbie in Emacs world.
 I am using Turkish keyboard layout. Normally, I make # sign by pressing  in my MacOS computer. But i cannot make it in Emacs. I am currently using EmacsPlus@29.
 I encounter the same issue in other subtle signs.
 I want to make Emacs keyboard layout same as system. It seems that they are same but as i said, some keys is not available.
 ​
 Can you help me?

 --EDIT

                              <span>I have been using message to show the output of a dictionary. So the definition goes to the *Messages* buffer and the echo area.
 So far so good. But when the dictionary entry is too long, the echo area shows the bottom of the string. 
 Is it possible to force message to show the beginning of the definition instead? 
 I don&#x27;t want to truncate the string, as if the definition is too long, I can still inspect the *Messages* buffer.
 thank you for any help

                              <span>One can open an android APK as a project in Android Studio. If the APK has been installed on a mobile that has developer options enabled, it is then possible to get a log of what happens during the apps start up.
 Install the app on the mobile, ensure that the developer options are enabled. In developer options enable USB debugging. Connect the computer to the mobile with a USB cable. At first connection you will have to authorize (on the mobile) access from the computer. In developer options go to &quot;Select debug app&quot; and choose, say &quot;org.gnu.emacs&quot;. Also enable &quot;Wait for debugger&quot;.
 See the following web page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16929391/android-how-to-debug-apps-start-up-process
 Check that you can access the mobile from the computer by running from the command line e.g.:
 - adb -d shell
 ls
 Now open the APK as a project in Android Studio, if you have not already done this. In the device manager (View &gt; Tool Windows &gt; Device Manager), select you mobile under &quot;Physical&quot;.
 Start emacs on the mobile. You should get a requester &quot;Waiting for debugger&quot;. In Android Studio select Run &gt; Attach to Process. This should open a debug console, but this window will probably only show that Android Studio connects to the app, but then loses the connection (because the app crashes).
 All is not lost: In the debug window select &quot;Logcat&quot; at the bottom. This will probably also not show a lot, but notice at the top of the window the text &quot;package:myapp&quot; or some such. Change this to &quot;package:org.gnu.emacs&quot;, and you should now hopefully see a crash log.

                              <span>Here is how I succeeded in building Android emacs with the libpng library. The process is described in the emacs repo file ./java/INSTALL, but here are some additional details. My initial build of emacs with this library crashed at start up. I will describe in a separate post how I debugged this.
 I browsed to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng and made a git clone of the repo. I then used magit to select branch android13-release. There was no Android.mk file in that branch, so I looked for it in older release branches. The newest release branch that had an Android.mk was nougat-release, so I copied that file outside the repo, went back to branch android13-release and moved Android.mk into the repo directory.
 I compared the file to Android.bp but saw essentially nothing that was needed to change. I set LOCAL_SDK_VERSION :&#x3D; 25, but am unsure if that variable has any significance. I eventually compared Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt, and discovered that I had missed a file needed in my_src_files_arm: arm/palette_neon_intrinsics.c
 Building without that extra source file caused no complaint from the build, but emacs crashed at start up.
 To build with the libpng library I added the following option to configure:
 --with-ndk-path&#x3D;$HOME/projects/android/libpng
 After the build it is a good idea to check that the expected library files are actually in the build directory:
 ls cross/ndk-build

                              <span>Like the title, the face of the normal text portion is default, how can I change the font of that face but only apply to Org-mode.
 I also find a face name: org-default, but when I try to change the font of that face, Emac output an error said that face is invalid.
 I have try to use this code from another question on this sub:

 But when I use M-x describe-face, the text portion still hasn&#x27;t changed. Any help would be appreciated.
 UPDATE:
 I was able to fix my problem thanks to Protesilaos Stavrou, you can find more here.
 ;Function only run in Org mode, to separate it with emac. (defface your-new-face-remap &#x27;((t (:font &quot;Fira Mono&quot; :height 130))) &quot;My custom font for org mode default.&quot;) (define-minor-mode your-new-face-mode &quot;Remap the face of org mode default.&quot; :local t :init-value nil (if your-new-face-mode ;if true do (setq your-new-face-remap-cookie (face-remap-add-relative &#x27;default &#x27;your-new-face-remap-style)) ;if false do (face-remap-remove-relative my-comment-remap-cookie))) (add-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook #&#x27;your-new-face-mode) 
 The defface is really finicky, you must have &#x27;((&#x27; for it to work.

 Is there a more convenient way to see the effective (local and global at once, maybe even combined) value for the current buffer?

                              <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with Elpaca in my init file and am still trying to understand the combination of Elpaca and use-package. I haven&#x27;t found many example init files online using Elpaca. If any of you have such an online init file, and would be willing to post a link to it in the replies, I would appreciate the help. Thanks.

                              <span>More specifically, it would be great to have two keys moving forward or backward between sections, or begin block, to their beginning position. As I found forward or backward paragraph considers more in the block than I thought, at which you need repeat a lot of times to move out one block, which is inconvenient.

                              <span>Hi, based on my online research, it seems that setopt functions similarly to setq, but for user-specific settings. Does this mean that it is safe to use setopt for all the variables listed under M-x customize-option?
 Also, if a variable is not specific to a buffer (buffer local), will using setopt set its value globally, similar to how setq-default works? I mean setopt knows when to use setq vs. setq-default behind the scenes?

                              <span>Hi folks -- I&#x27;ve had my Emacs installed with Nix home-manager, but I&#x27;ve been stuck with Emacs 28 for a while because of that. I wanted to give Emacs 29 a try (the nixpkgs update seems imminent as of writing though), but I couldn&#x27;t make the emacs-overlay to work out for me. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m doing something silly and incorrect -- but with Homebrew with emacs-mac, I can use &#x60;--with-mac-metal&#x60; and other flags such as &#x60;--with-no-title-bars&#x60;, which I don&#x27;t see how I can do that with Nix setup. I&#x27;m fairly new to Nix and very possible I&#x27;m not seeing something obvious.
 I&#x27;d like to hear opinions on how people install Emacs on macOS -- do you use Homebrew for apps including Emacs even if you use Nix, or do you stick to Emacs on Nix? What are some of extra flags I should be aware of?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently running a normal .hs file on my computer. But constantly nanoing into the file and out again, then compiling gets repetitive very quickly. 
 Does anyone know a better way to preform this task? Something where you don&#x27;t have to exit a file and re enter into it over and over again. 
 (I tried installing stack onto arch but it didn&#x27;t work)
 Thank you for reading this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading the book FP Simplified and find this part confusing. The author said that this function is impure (reading username from standard input) :
 def getUsername: IO[String] &#x3D; ???
 I don&#x27;t think so because the function just returns a data structure describing the computation of getting username. Additionally, the function doesn&#x27;t return values such as IO(&quot;alvin&quot;) or IO(&quot;kim&quot;) but IO(d()) instead, while d() represents defered execution codes. Am I wrong ?

                              <span>Hello fellow emacs users :)
 Long time basic user here.
 I like to play online radios while I work on emacs. Have this bit of code to play them on emacs:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defcustom emms-radio-channels &#x27;() &quot;User defined online radio channels.&quot; :type &#x27;(repeat (cons (string :tag &quot;Name&quot;) (string :tag &quot;URL&quot;))) :group &#x27;emms)
 (defun emms-play-radio () &quot;Show candidates from &#x60;emms-radio-channels&#x27; on a completion buffer. Play the selection using EMMS.&quot; (interactive) (let ((channel (completing-read &quot;Channel: &quot; (mapcar #&#x27;car emms-radio-channels) nil nil))) (emms-play-url (or (cdr (assoc channel emms-radio-channels)) channel))))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Then, I&#x27;m using use-package to load my module and customize the list of channels (short example)
  (use-package multimedia :ensure nil :custom (emms-radio-channels &#x27;((&quot;openFM - smooth jazz&quot; . &quot;https://stream.open.fm/60&quot;) (&quot;jazz radio funk&quot; . &quot;https://jazz-wr06.ice.infomaniak.ch/jazz-wr06-128.mp3&quot;) (&quot;bbc radio3&quot; . &quot;https://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_three&quot;) (&quot;swingFM&quot; . &quot;https://swingfm.ice.infomaniak.ch/swingfm-128.mp3&quot;) (&quot;radioSky - jazz&quot; . &quot;http://listen.radioskymusic.com:7006/live&quot;) (&quot;soundtrack radio station&quot; . &quot;http://streamingp.shoutcast.com/JamendoLounge&quot;)))) 
 It works great but my list is way longer than that and it is a bit of a pain to add new streams to it.
 I&#x27;m wonder if there&#x27;s a way to convert standalone org links to a list like the above. I&#x27;m fairly sure there&#x27;s a way but I&#x27;m a newbie to org mode besides basic outline and babel functions.
 Thanks for your input!

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;m looking for a way to make my config more modular. Now I have a structure like this:
 emacs/init.el emacs/configs/modes-config.el emacs/configs/core-config.el emacs/configs/ui-config.el 
 emacs/init.el:
 (setq user-init-file (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name))) (setq user-emacs-directory (file-name-directory user-init-file)) (eval-and-compile (add-to-list &#x27;load-path (locate-user-emacs-file &quot;config/&quot;))) (require &#x27;modes-config) (require &#x27;core-config) (require &#x27;ui-config) 
 But I want to add nested directories like this:
 emacs ├── init.el ├── core │ ├── autosave.el │ ├── backups.el │ └── init.el ├── modes │ ├── evil-mode.el │ ├── init.el │ └── org-mode.el └── ui ├── init.el ├── modeline.el ├── reset.el └── themes.el 
 emacs/init.el:
 (require &#x27;core) (require &#x27;modes) (require &#x27;ui) 
 emacs/core/init.el:
 (require &#x27;autosave) (require &#x27;backups) (provide &#x27;core) 
 emacs/modes/init.el
 (require &#x27;evil-mode) (require &#x27;org-mode) (provide &#x27;modes) 
 Is there any way to split my init.el into multiple files *and* directories?

                              <span>Hi, going to be honest, I set these configs a long time ago and I&#x27;ve just been using the same configs for years now. I have the following in my ~/.emacs file:
 (setq package-list &#x27;(auto-complete restclient go-mode exec-path-from-shell)) (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;http://tromey.com/elpa/&quot;) (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;marmalade&quot; . &quot;http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (package-initialize) (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents)) (dolist (package package-list) (unless (package-installed-p package) (package-install package))) 
 I&#x27;ve redacted some lines, but I tried to show what I feel like is relevant to my problem.
 I do not have auto-complete installed and every time I attempt to install it, I get a &quot;Not Found&quot; response.
 The following is an example of my ~/.emacs.d directory:
 .emacs.d/ auto-save-list/ elpa/ archives/ elpa/ archive-contents/ gnu/ archive-contents/ 
 I don&#x27;t see any files (visible and hidden) or additional directories within any of the directories mentioned above.
 Does anyone possibly know the issue I&#x27;m running into?
 ​
 Edit:Just want to add that I&#x27;ve also tried the following in place of using setq:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;http://tromey.com/elpa/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;marmalade&quot; . &quot;http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;))

                              <span>So basically, I want to export my notes which have relative images attached to them, which works really well when I am using it with just org mode. But now I have to export the notes to pdf to share it with the instructor. So I basically want the images to be explicitly embedded in the pdf file, and not a hyperlink pointing to the image.I am getting the desired results by removing the metadata while linking the image in the org file, like just doing [[./filename.png]]. I wanted to know whether there was some way to make this emacs&#x27; default behavior?
 I use pandoc to convert org to pdf directly. Pandoc uses pdflatex on the backend.
 Thanks for your time.

                              <span>I regularly move away from Emacs to check something else quickly, eg a simple google search.
 I have keybinds for searching Google from Emacs but I don&#x27;t have a nice way of going back without a mouse or showing all windows and then selecting Emacs.
 Ive used auto hotkey in the past to accomplish something similar, has anyone come up with a better method/found a better tool?
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to press C-x o since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to in Emacs but I&#x27;m open to other keybinds.

                              <span>Emacs&#x27; cut/copy/paste bindings aren&#x27;t that terrible. Personally, I got used to them in quite a short time.
 However, problem arises when one is too used to those bindings. How many closed tabs in Firefox, oh boy.
 But we are on Emacs, there&#x27;s a solution for everything, some less practical than others:
  
Remapping C-x and C-c maps is quite a chore, since AFAIK many features are hard coded to those prefixes.
 
CUA mode is also not preferable since C-c and C-c are highly used prefixes
 
Having cut/copy/paste globally bound to different common keys could be an option, however binding settings are relative to specific application or graphical toolkit
 
 What are your experiences in this regard?

Everything is working fine (code navigation, completion, documentation etc) except code formatting. When I do eglot-format on a region of code with very long lines, nothing happens. I also have yapfify-mode installed in Emacs and if I do yapfify-region it works as it should.
 When I check the Eglot events buffer I can see a client request for rangeFormatting but the server reply with a result nil, it seems python-lsp-server does not pickup yapf to do formatting.
 Do I need to do additional configuration in Emacs to get python-lsp-server to use yapf and perform code formatting?

 I.E. M-x  emacs, and it will give me a buffer full of links to the entry headers with the tag &quot;emacs&quot;.
 N.B. These are not necessarily agenda files but archival files, or project notes in org-mode.

                              <span>tldr: I think Emacs 29 is slower than 28 so I downgraded it. 
 Longer version: I have 2 Apple laptops, one super new, the other super old. I ran either 29 or 30 on them in the past months. In the last couple of weeks I focused on the 29 branch, running the pretests and as of last week, installed the official 29.1.
 I guess I began to see slowness or lagging, since I explicitly began a bankruptcy on the older laptop - initially thinking I have too much packages. Everything was lagging: browsing org files, startup times, describe-variable took couple of seconds to return results, M-x completion with vertico had a noticeable lag with each key press, key press latency in writing, eglot jumping to definitions. So much so that I really started thinking about replacing my old laptop.
 Yesterday I decided that I want to test whether it&#x27;s due to Emacs. I reverted back to 28.2 on both laptops. It was night and day. The new laptop flies; the old laptop runs smoothly so I even reverted the bankruptcy, adding back all the packages I removed and it&#x27;s still as smooth as I remember Emacs running in the past. 
 This is not a bug report. It&#x27;s my own observation, running multiple versions of Emacs on old and new hardware, sometimes compiling from source, sometimes downloading from https://emacsforosx.com/. I just want to raise awareness, see if people have a similar experience. If enough evidence arises, perhaps someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing can run benchmarks or profiling and we&#x27;ll go from there.

                              <span>As i&#x27;m getting my Emacs config closer and closer to where i want, it inevitably starts &quot;behaving weird&quot;. This is something i&#x27;ve struggled with again and again, and it has, once or twice, lead me away from emacs. But now i want to understand this:
 What is the proper order to configure and load stuff in my config, so that everything works correctly?
 Currently i&#x27;m facing an issue with standard-themes. Normally, themes are what i put below &quot;emacs internal configs&quot; but at the top of my &quot;external packages&quot;. But the standard-themes-light theme doesn&#x27;t load correctly. Centaur tabs are dark, org-mode code blocks aren&#x27;t proplerly backgrounded. If i switch themes after starting emacs, and switch back to standard-light, everything is fine. I tried loading the theme as the last thing in my init.el, but that didn&#x27;t change the behavior.
 This is only one issue currently. I&#x27;ve had others in the past.
 Since i&#x27;m pretty new to writing my emacs config from scratch, could some of the &quot;veterans&quot; explain what i should be putting where? Does splitting the config into a few files help? What&#x27;s the &quot;best practice&quot; here?

                              <span>I havent used Emacs on a Mac in a year or two so I don&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve had this problem in the past but I am fof the next couple of weeks and I&#x27;m running into some annoyances with short cut clashes. 
 Notably Emacs search and replace (M-%) instead triggers the Mac OS screen shot until. 
 For those of you on a Mac which are you rebinding in this situation? The os shortcut or Emacs. 
 I though I had set the command key to not get passed to the os but that doesn&#x27;t seem to fix the issue.

                              <span>So I am currently a Java engineer writing basic CRUD stuff with spring boot. Spring provides all of the boilerplate to talk to the DB, provide HTTP endpoints, .. There&#x27;s no concurrency involved and it&#x27;s pretty basic stuff.
 Cats-effect is marketed as a &quot;pure asynchronous runtime&quot; while ZIO provides &quot;type-safe, composable asynchronous and concurrent programming&quot;.
 Both of these put quite the emphasis on &quot;asynchronous&quot; and &quot;concurrent&quot;, which makes me wonder: 
 Say I want to do what I do now, the basic HTTP crud stuff, but with Scala, is it overkill to go for http4s or zio-http?

                              <span>I was looking for a good language to implement a personal project I have (a search engine). After listening to Martin Odersky&#x27;s talk &quot;Simply Scala&quot; at ScalaIO Parris 2022, I decided to give Scala a try. I practiced some Scala 3 and everything worked great. So far I really like the language. I am at the stage of selecting the libraries that I will use for the project. I wanted to implement the backend in Scala but after I stumbled with the Lift framework and after reading other posts on Full Stack Scala, I really want to give it a try. Specially since my UI is going to be simple. I was thinking of using Scalatra for the backend and maybe Lift in the front end (if the UI gets complex enough). But I noticed that both frameworks only have stable versions that are compatible with Scala 2. This article (https://medium.com/@takezoe/scalatra-now-supports-scala3-4eb8988484a7) claims that Scalatra supports Scala 3. It makes sense, since (as I understand) Scala 3 is binary compatible with Scala 2. But the Scalatra docs only covers the Scala 2 version. There are no docs for the Scala 3 version. Is this because there is no meaningful difference between the APIs of the two versions? I also read a post that mentioned that Akka did not fully support Scala 3( I tried finding it again to link it here but I couldn&#x27;t find it). This gives me the impresion that Scala 3 is still not supported by most libraries.
 I have not tried to run any test projects because I still need to learn how to use sbt (I started learning Scala a couple of days ago). But I got cold feet. Before I proceed, in order to spare myself unnecessary hurdles, I would like some advice. Should I learn Scala 2 and wait until the ecosystem migrates to Scala 3? Or is it recommended to stick to Scala 3 and work around the few incompatibilities that some frameworks might have?

 I&#x27;ve thought of just making a private GitHub repository for it, but I&#x27;m a little apprehensive about doing that as I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if my notes somehow make their way into training data for large language models.
 What are some solutions that you folks use?

                              <span>I realize that this question might seem trivial, but I&#x27;ve been pondering something. When I initiate org-capture, I select a predefined template, and then the screen splits horizontally. The lower half of the screen is where I input the content I&#x27;m capturing. I&#x27;m wondering if it wouldn&#x27;t be more convenient to have the capturing process take up the entire window instead of being split. Is there any specific purpose for the upper area during the capturing process?
 I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a customizable variable for this, and I would greatly appreciate your suggestions on the matter.

I&#x27;ve turned on tramp-debug to 6 and the issue seems to be that Emacs sends the following hardcoded command in tramp-sh.el  &quot;exec env TERM&#x3D;&#x27;%s&#x27; INSIDE_EMACS&#x3D;&#x27;%s&#x27; &quot; &quot;ENV&#x3D;%s %s PROMPT_COMMAND&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; PS1&#x3D;%s PS2&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; PS3&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; %s %s -i&quot;) 
 With the expectation that the shell output is controlled by the variables PS1, PS2, PS3 etc.
 However, from the man pages of csh, the prompt output is controlled by prompt, prompt2 and prompt3. Does emacs tramp have a way to address this? 
 I&#x27;m running GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2022-09-13 from windows. Again the issues seems that the csh that I&#x27;m trying to set as remote does not use PS1, PS2, PS3 and emacs has it hardcoded.

 user@host ~/org % file inbox.org misc.org inbox.org: data misc.org: Unicode text, UTF-8 text, with very long lines (1289) user@host ~/org % 
 Somewhere in inbox.org is at least one character that makes &quot;file&quot; think that it&#x27;s not a text file.
 In GNU Emacs 27.1, both files are shown as &quot;utf-8-unix&quot; in my modeline.
 So the issue with this wrong classification is not within Emacs but within some shell foo I&#x27;m doing outside of Emacs.
 Except the obvious bisect-remove-until-found-method: is there a clever (Emacs-)way to locate the character(s) that cause this?

                              <span>Thanks to the answers from my last question, I now have a cleanly-built and installed 29.1 on my Ubuntu 22.04 system. And as I get ready to explore some of the new features, I&#x27;m looking at my configuration with a wary eye; I&#x27;ve been using emacs (GNU, then XEmacs, then back to GNU) since my sophomore year of college (1987!), and my config shows it. Bloated, spaghetti-like, split among 15-16 files, etc.
 So, I&#x27;m deciding to take the &quot;configuration bankruptcy&quot; plunge and try to (mostly) restart from scratch. Yank almost everything out and start adding things back as I actually need them, not just because they look cool (and generally never get used).
 Those of you who&#x27;ve done this: any advice? I keep my config in GitHub, so for now I&#x27;m just creating a new branch to experiment on. I&#x27;m mostly concerned with not losing my history and desktop-mode settings.
 Edit: Just to clarify, despite the longevity I&#x27;m not really a &quot;power user&quot;. So there are a lot of features that I don&#x27;t come close to making the most of (Magit, etc.). My hope is that by cleaning this up and tightening things a little, I can grow into some new features.

                              <span>Using org-mode and mu4e. When I use emacs client as opposed to emacs-gtk and reply to a message by hitting R, typing the words I want to send and then going C-c C-c, the message sends andthe frame disappears. Then I have to invoke a new client to carry on with my stuff.
 I thought maybe C-c C-s might be my saviour but that just moves the cursor to the subject line and a mention in the echo area of a mark being set. 
 Obviously using emacs-gtk would be a work around, but I have not a clue why the client should be behaving this way. Your friend and mine, Google, has failed to furnish me with any viable clues.
 Help?

 I would like to improve my workflow for debugging any suggestions for packages or setups would be great.
 ​
 A couple of questions
 I seem to remember being able to hotkey from error to error on the output of the compilation at one time rather than using up-downs... how to you do this?
 Every time I compile I end up with yet another pane, I would like to fix the panes to left half full height edit and the make results on the right in a split plane. I know how to split panes but as I am compiling on the left I would like to have the results end up on the right pane... not overtake the left pane.
 Any other suggestions would be great.
 Kind regards for your help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve googled this every way I can, but no dice. When I use emacs -nw while ssh&#x27;d from one Mac into another, everything works fine until I switch to another app on the local machine. At first I thought it was Cmd-Tab that was doing it, so I tried just clicking other apps, but the problem remains.
 It appears that any clicks I do in other apps are somehow registering inside of emacs in the terminal. Specifically, when I switch to another app, the emacs buffer also switches to another one. And usually when I click on something in another app (even the preferences app for Terminal itself), the Terminal will randomly insert I and O in whatever buffer is selected.
 Running Emacs 29.1, installed via homebrew. And I&#x27;ve had this issue on an older mac running Big Sur as well as a newer mac running a more recent OS, both ssh-ing into an M1 MacBook pro with all my files on it. 
 Ideas?

                              <span>justl is a major mode for driving justfiles. Justfiles are a way to save and run project-specific commands. Think of them like Makefiles, but they are purely focused on running commands and processes, and not for a build system.
 This mode gives the ability to execute just recipes from within the editor itself.
 The new release with the changelog details here: https://github.com/psibi/justl.el/blob/master/Changelog.org#013
 The major highlight in this release is support for TRAMP. Links with more details:

                              <span>I am a novice with using the Android app build tools. This is what I discovered about how to set up a build environment, build Android emacs, and run it in the emulator.
 As I am a novice, some info here might be wrong or misleading, but this is my best effort.
 Instructions for how to build Android emacs are in the emacs repo, in file java/INSTALL.
 I am using Ubuntu, so these instructions are Ubuntu specific, but should be easily adaptable to other linux based distributions. Note that Android Studio, Android SDK, Android NDK can be downloaded from the software provider, if they are not available in your linux distributions package manager.
 I first installed Android Studio. It is available in the Ubuntu snap store:
 - sudo snap install android-studio

 I then ran Android Studio to set …</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I am writing a book and have over 250 plaintext files on the computer (all mailed from an app on the phone), about 20 are in org-mode.
 --- The mess ---
 - Snippets are unorganised in every way (made as I come up with them, jumping all over the place in the book-to-be, etc)
 - Each note contains multiple snippets, each of the snippets is divided by a marker.
 - Each snippet&#x27;s size can be a single line or multiple paragraphs.
 Each of the notes is named note-.txt
 --- The draft 0 ---
 Now I&#x27;m compiling the book&#x27;s draft zero out of the snippets, choosing some snippets, rejecting others from the same note.
 It&#x27;s daunting to see what I&#x27;ve left to do and what not, while not having much of an overview of the whole thing.
 ​
 Current workflow:
 - Placing &#x27;ACCEPTED--&#x27; in front of a snippet/org-header
 - Going over one file after another, when one is completely done with, put it folder &#x27;done&#x27;
 - Also, when snippets are big, I make the whole note into an org file, and can have some overview.
 ​
 --- The question ---
 I&#x27;m thinking of putting each snippet in their own file (via UNIX &#x27;sed&#x27; command) and have org-roam take care of the administration of the status (unread/accepted/rejected/need2ndview/need3rdview).
 Is this use-case something org-roam is capable of/handy for, and if not, what (package) would be advisable?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>Hi,
 I know Emacs on Windows is always slow. But with 29.1, it seems much slower. Interestingly, I feel it is only slow at start-up or when you first use some function in a session. Once it is started or you have triggered the function, everything runs smoothly.
 Any idea why?

                              <span>We have a project with the backend in Haskell (basically a Servant-based CRUD app with a bit of extra data ingress and egress through AWS SQS and some background tasks for sending out emails etc.).
 This is an early product, basically a prototype we have been running with a key customer (soon two) but we have really strong interest and now need to start upping the pace of delivery.
 The current team has some great support from an experienced Haskeller, but only part-time, which has allowed them to get this far but we now need a full-time contractor to come on board and accelerate the project.
 If you have experience shipping actual products built in Haskell, especially in startups (or, at least, early in the project&#x27;s lifecycle), then please drop me a line (here or by email: gideon@converge.io). I would prefer freelance contractors to big consultancies. We are UK-based, additionally, which means we would prefer someone on UK+-2h timezone (but for the right person we can be flexible).

                              <span>Hi all! I&#x27;m looking for ways - both technical-wise and organizational-wise - to set up org agenda. I&#x27;ve familiarized with org quite a bit now but getting into the agenda seems overwhelming every time I try to approach it. 
 I&#x27;d like to know good resources and opinionated usage examples. 
 Moreover, I&#x27;d like to know if org-ql is meant to be an extension or a replacement of org&#x27;s standard filter predicates. Org agenda&#x27;s built in filter predicates look quite cumbersome and I&#x27;d like to know if it would be possible to configure org agenda by just using org-ql languages or if I&#x27;m gonna need to use it anyway.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>In OneNote I can do simple equations like 2+2&#x3D; 
 Once I press space after the &#x3D; sign it will automatically auto-complete the correct answer. 
 So essentially you can do simple equations in OneNote without bringing out a calculator. 
 Can we do this in Emacs Org Mode? 
 If we can&#x27;t its fine as it&#x27;s not a deal breaker or anything but I am just curious. 
 If my explanation of the feature I want isn&#x27;t good enough here is the Microsoft webpage where they explain it. https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/insert-and-calculate-simple-math-equations-in-onenote-6d8346d3-2c1e-490b-bcbb-f739d9323e1b

                              <span>I managed to do something in my config file to cause this org version mismatch error. This is emacs 29.0.92 built from source. I&#x27;m doing the literate config thing so my init.el is simply:
 (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;config.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) and my config is in config.org. 
 Googling this error says to specify my load-path before org gets loaded. I don&#x27;t know where org gets loaded - I don&#x27;t have a use-package org anywhere. Nor do I have a load-path. So I don&#x27;t know how to even start pin pointing what I did wrong.
 Would this have been better in r/emacs?

                              <span>Back when I started using Emacs a few years ago, I went all out and added tons of stuff to my setup. But as time passed, I realized I hardly use most of those packages. Nowadays, I&#x27;m keeping it minimal and sticking mainly to Org mode.
 I&#x27;m thinking of setting up a capture template for my journaling, kind of like this:
 &quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal entry&quot; entry (file+olp+datetree &quot;~/orgfiles/journal.org&quot;) &quot;** %^{Heading}&quot;) 
 The downside of this approach is that everything will end up in a single file, which might grow over time and become challenging to manage. However, I can archive all the journal entries at the end of the year and starting fresh annually to counter this.
 I&#x27;ve been thinking about whether it&#x27;s worthwhile to use a separate package, since org-journal appears to generate a similar date tree.

 ((&quot;memoir&quot; ... (&quot;\\chapter{%s}&quot; . &quot;\\chapter*{%s}&quot;) ... )) 
 However, in the case of \chapter* I want to pass the section title to the exporter twice, once as a required argument and once as an optional argument. (I.e. \chapter*[title]{title}.) This is because the optional argument is necessary for memoir to put the chapter title in the running header.
 If I try \\chapter*[%s]{%s} it of course fails with org-export-data: Not enough arguments for format string. Is there a straightforward way to achieve what I want? Has anyone found another way to get running chapter headings working with memoir?
 (This is with Org mode version 9.6.7.)

                              <span>Given following function with 3 parameters:
 def foo(a: A, b: B, c: C): D &#x3D; ??? 
 If we know that a changes rarely, we can kind of curry it using OOP:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B, c: C): D &#x3D; ??? 
 Now, what are reasons to change, say, c to implicit like this:
 class Foo(private val a: A): def foo(b: B)(using c: C): D &#x3D; ??? 
 My thoughts so far:
  
Capability. Like CanThrow or DbTransaction - indicating function requires special scope for evaluation - e.g. scope catching specific exceptions or scope running database transaction, committing or aborting it in the end.
 Mutable data - to keep our class Foo immutable, we can pass so-called Context containing mutable stuff - caches for example.
 Stateful objects with lifecycle - if C has close() method, we have following options: a) pass c via Foo&#x27;s constructor and add close() to Foo, making it mutable b) pass c as ordinary parameter which clutters client code without much benefit c) use context function that provides implicit C in scope and closes C when it leaves the scope.
  
I&#x27;m calling out for other people&#x27;s experience - which of those are good ideas? Which are not-so-good ideas? May be there are other considerations?
 This is about dependency management, I would like to leave other uses of implicit parameters out of scope of this discussion.

 I have &#x27;name&#x27; variable that should be initialized in &#x27;init&#x27; method and used in &#x27;run&#x27; method. This variable may not be initialized, so I declared it as Option.

 Is there an way to avoid using var in this case?

                              <span>Why link statically against musl?
Have you ever faced compatibility issues when dealing with Linux
binary executables? The culprit is often the libc implementation,
glibc. Acting as the backbone of nearly all Linux distros,
glibc is the library responsible for providing standard C functions. Yet, its
version compatibility often poses a challenge. Binaries compiled with
a newer version of glibc may not function on systems running an older
one, creating a compatibility headache.
So, how can we circumvent this issue?
The approach we’ll focus on today involves the creation of static executables. These
executables are self-contained and do not dynamically load libc,
thereby offering enhanced portability.
However, we’re not out of the woods yet. Glibc is
not well-suited for static linking becaus…</span>

I know some programming, but I would rather start from a resource that assumes no background.
 I&#x27;ve also been told by many around the web that it&#x27;s better to start with another programming language then go to Haskell, is that true?
 And yes, I have read the sidebar, LYAH doesn&#x27;t have exercise so that&#x27;s a pass, Real World Haskell has barely no exercises while being quite long and seems quite advance which is also a pass from me, School of Haskell is too short, while suffering from a mixture of the last two. 
 The only three promising resources(for my learning style, which is text-based w/ exercises) Haskell from the Very Beginning by Whitington, the Haskell Wikibooks and Learn Haskell by Building a Blog Generator by Gilmi.
 Any advice regarding those resources is appreciated.

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
      
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Now in the scotty code I just want to get all the ids (preferably a list of ints).
 I thought I could just use &quot;param&quot; and get the list of values as text, but it turned out I only got the first one.
 Code for getting the first one:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 get &quot;/add-entries&quot; $ do ids &lt;- param &quot;id[]&quot; :: ActionM Text text ids
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Does anyone know how I can achieve getting all of them?

                              <span>I am searching for a way to get non blocking keyboard input (raw keys), by non-blocking i mean that if there is no character to read from stdin (no key pressed), it should return immediately, as to not block the thread and let rest of the code figure out itself.
 as an example of what i tried:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell import System.IO (stdin, hReady, hSetBuffering, hSetEcho, BufferMode(NoBuffering)) import Control.Monad (when)
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do hSetBuffering stdin NoBuffering hSetEcho stdin False loop
 loop :: IO () loop &#x3D; do key  getKey&#x27; &quot;&quot;
 getKey&#x27; :: [Char] -&gt; IO [Char] getKey&#x27; xs &#x3D; do ready &lt;- hReady stdin if ready then do x &lt;- getChar getKey&#x27; (x : xs) else return xs

 data InputType &#x3D; Name | Select | Date | Textarea deriving Show instance ToJSON InputType where toJSON Name &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;name&quot; toJSON Select &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;select&quot; toJSON Date &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;date&quot; toJSON Textarea &#x3D; String $ pack &quot;textarea&quot; 
 How would the FromJSON instance look like?

                              <span>I had a bit of an emacs hiccup and needed to remove my straight/repos and rebuild. 
 I noticed that org is being cloned despite me having
  
(straight-use-package &#x27;org) 
  
early in my init. And 
  
(use-package org 
 :straight (:type built-in)
  
Before I rush into spewing out config, I know this was an issue in the past, but is there a simple solution I&#x27;m missing? What could be causing it? 
 My emacs 29.1 has org built in. I guess I should also be asking if using the built in is correct in a straight.el environment.

                              <span>How is your experience with Dap-Mode so far? Have you been able to use it as your daily development tool for debugging? If so, is it stable for you?
 ​
 Background, I failed to set it up properly a couple of times. Once I set it up, then I experienced buggy behavior (like losing connection with the debug server when stepping through the code). Today, I decided to check out its latest state and hit another bug.
 This is the only config I made for python and I am on Doom Emacs
 (require &#x27;dap-python) (setq dap-python-debugger &#x27;debugpy) 
 and install the server in my environment
 pip install debugpy 
 I will give it another go for this week to see if it is stable.
 EDIT: Another issue (related to doom) I just came across is company completion in dap-ui-repl doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe doom is the problem :/

 When I try to open magit-status buffer with window1 or window2 active, it splits the terminal window horizontally to display it.
 How can I prevent this to happen? I want it the magit-status buffer to open in the bigger windows. If window is active, it would open in window2, and vice versa.
 I tried to use a different magit-display-buffer-function but it seems there isn&#x27;t one to do that. The closest one I found would open the magit buffer over the current active buffer.
 I also tried to use winner-mode, so I could hide the terminal window before using magit-status by using winner-undo, but since I move between many windows, using the undo got confusing. Maybe there&#x27;s a way to quickly toggle a window in the frame?

                              <span>I’m experimenting with an AppleScript that gathers a list of windows from MacOS so that I can use them in a completing read function and switch to the selected Mac window from within Emacs. 
 My rough first draft is actually working, but the trouble is, running the AppleScript that collects the window list is very slow. It completes immediately outside of Emacs and in an Emacs shell. However, when I run it with call-process-shell-command, shell-command-to-string, or from a process started with make-process, it takes 2-5 seconds. 
 What’s happening? How can I improve the performance?

                              <span>Before emacs 29 I could easily use &quot;(&quot; to show details-mode and there was one line, above all files list, with the total used by those (non directory) files in the current directory.
 Listing files with ls and eshell/ls shows the total and with &quot;emacs -q&quot; the behavior is the same, so I know it&#x27;s not a package issue. I can&#x27;t find anything in the NEWS file that justifies this change in behavior. 
 Does anyone know how to fix this?

                              <span>I would classify myself as an intermediate elisp coder and would like to write a new package. I&#x27;ve found a small handful of tutorials and guides out there for how to write packages, but wanted to solicit opinions from the community about whether there are any good 1) tutorials or 2) example projects to draw from when starting fresh. I&#x27;m bound to make some mistakes but would like to start off on the right foot if there&#x27;s some best practices out there that folks find helpful.
 Thanks!

                              <span>With Zotra, you can get a bibliography entry from a url or a search identifier (DOI, ISBN, PMID, arXiv ID). You can even add a bookmark to you browser so that when you click it, the bibliography information of the webpage you&#x27;re visiting would be saved in some bib file. You can also get the links for attachments and download them from Emacs.
 This is done using Zotero translators, so it basically has the full power of Zotero. There is no need for the Zotero client, but it needs to connect to either Zotero translation server or zotra-cli as the backend.

 So, I wasn&#x27;t going to post this here but somebody bugged me enough to do it (again) and post this story about how I came to use Emacs as a non-coder.
 Enjoy. 🙃

                              <span>I am currently using spacemacs with the tree-sitter layer enabled. My emacs version is compiled so that native treesit should work, and I am indeed able to apply (for example) &#x60;python-ts-mode&#x60; to a python file and get all the treesit functions to work.
 As far as I understand it, the tree-sitter layer is using the external package, which has some disadvantages. What is the right way to transition from the external package to the native one? Disabling the layer seems to have other implications and the transition is not natural (for example, I don&#x27;t see my python-mode hooks apply to python-ts-mode). 
 I know this is a bit general, but perhaps someone has experience making the transition specifically with spacemacs?

I&#x27;m aware that the following is not new. It&#x27;s probably part of Plato&#x27;s Collected Works, book 7 or so.
The elements of programming, according to Abelson and Sussman (Structure and interpretation of computer programs, 2nd edition, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. (1996), page 4)
Primitive Expressions: represent the simplest entities of the language;
Means of Combination: building compound elements from simpler ones;
Means of Abstraction: naming and manipulating compound elements as units.
When techies lament that everything is &quot;abstractions upon abstractions&quot;, they lament the result of doing the process of combining small things into larger things, and then tre…</span>

 for example:
  [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29655971/258917459-fd279e8f-61c8-4dfa-96b4-8edaa8a6378d.png]] 
 However, on doom emacs I can only get images that point to local files to display inline.

 I&#x27;ve tried changing (setq org-display-remote-inline-images t) variable to t and &#x27;cache (it&#x27;s &#x27;download by default) but to no avail.

 I’m an Emacs newbie. I’m on macOS (Emacs 29.1 with native comp and pixel scroll). I want to use Emacs for managing a lot of my Markdown notes in a specific folder, and also implements Org-Mode. I have thousands of notes in my folder. Coming from Obsidian, there was a very nice extension called Omnisearch that would index the content of my notes and allows me to search them easily (title and content). In Emacs, I think that rg.el (frontend for ripgrep) could allow me to easily search through my notes. I heard about org-roam and some built-in search but I’m not interested in this package. I will start with mardown-mode and org-mode, and may try Denote in the future.
 My pain points and questions are the following:
 ​
  
Do you know which package could best match the search features of Omnisearch? As a beginner I’m a bit lost with the sheer amount of packages to do search (helm-rg, helm-ag, helm-org-riffle, deft, rg.el, counsel…). I settled on rg.el but I am not sure.
 When I open Emacs, it always start at the directory ~/. If I only want to manage the files in the notes directory, how should I go about that? Should I always use Dired to go to the directory and then exit? Or should I create a project (project.el ) for the directory containing all my notes? I see that a lot of package have features to interact with projects. I am a bit unclear about when to create a project or not.
 I installed Helm because it is always mentioned (I prefer a single package to do the thing rather that the popular alternative that is a combination of a lot of small packages), but should I even use Helm at all if I want to use Emacs to write, edit and search notes? I’m a bit unclear about the real value for me (I’m probably not advanced enough).
  
Thanks for your help!

 I have no idea what I was trying to do with M-^M.
 Is it a valid key binding and, if so, what keys is it?

 It essentially tries to mimic Vimium, a vim navigation like extension in browsers. 
 Anyway, the code is not the greatest, there will be bugs, etc, its a WIP.
 As of now, it requires Avy, shr, and shrface. Let me know what you think, I will try to spend some time on it if it gets traction but I am also re-viving my youtube channel with videos on Emacs(already have a few scheduled!), so time is limited :)

 I am trying to configure dap for C# debugging. Currently, I have dap-mode and dap-netcore installed and enabled. But when I try M-x dap-debug, I get the error
  
Have you loaded the ‘coreclr’ specific dap package?
  
I installed it from Nuget using
  
nuget install Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR
  
but it did not work as well. I could not find any useful info on how to load it. How can I load it so that I can make dap-debug work?

 I am installing MSYS&#x27;s Emacs 28.2 on my new work laptop.
 I could not get Spacemacs devel branch to load. The error message is an invalid Win32 file.
 Native elisp load failed: c:/Users/xyz/.emacs.d/eln-cache/28.2-10075233/subr--trampoline-6b696c6c2d656d616373_kill_emacs_0.eln, %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
 When I looked into the eln cache directory, several eln files had zero bytes. Those are the ones that were tripping up the loading of Spacemacs.
 I deleted the files, and restarted Spacemacs, but got the same message again, and the same zero-byte files were recreated.
 Emacs 28.2 was running OK on my old laptop, and had no problem creating the eln files.
 Any thoughts on what may be going on?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve implemented a new package treesitter-context, which is similar to nvim-treesitter-context, to show code context.
 It&#x27;s based on the built-in treesit in Emacs 29.1, so you have to update Emacs to the latest version if you want to try this package.
 It supports only a few languages, such as c/cpp, java, rust, python. There is a guide in README to help you add support for other languages.
 Here is an image showing how it looks like. Enjoy it :)

There is a treesitter library available for ObjC but there doesn&#x27;t seem to exist a corresponding objc-ts-mode i Emacs. Or does it and I simply fail to configure Emacs correctly?

 Ive installed both the haskell compiler and cabal tool, checked that they are installed in a powershell terminal. I have the following extensions on vscode endabled: coderunner, haskell and haskell syntax. 
 why does ghci say error: variable nor in scope? Its this way everytime I try to run any code in haskell

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trying to map across tuples of the form (1,(2,(3,()))) and the below code works
 class F a b where f :: a -&gt; b class MapT a b where mapT :: a -&gt; b instance Num a &#x3D;&gt; F a a where f &#x3D; (+1) instance MapT () () where mapT () &#x3D; () instance (F a b, MapT as bs) &#x3D;&gt; MapT (a, as) (b, bs) where mapT (a, as) &#x3D; (f a, mapT as) test :: (Int, (Double, (Float, ()))) test &#x3D; mapT (1::Int, (2::Double, (3::Float, ()))) 
 I think the elements have to be a member of a typeclass (in this case Num) for this to work, and I don&#x27;t think you can use the same MapT typeclass on different typeclasses of elements, but is there a way to use different functions of the same typeclass elements?

                              <span>Can anyone explain to me why Haskell doesn&#x27;t use the standard type system used for numbers in math? N (counting numbers) are a type of Z (integer) are a type of Q (rational) are a type of R (real) are a type of C (complex)? If Haskell did follow this type structure there would no need for &quot;fromIntegral&quot; and things like this:
 myPlus :: Int -&gt; Double -&gt; Double
 myPlus x y &#x3D; x + y
 would compile. What is the motivation for the numeric type system Haskell uses? Why are Ints not treated as a subtype of Reals? Maybe I&#x27;m missing something and the reason is obvious...but wouldn&#x27;t it be more logical to follow the usual math type system?

 I&#x27;m very happy to announce the release of Yampa 0.14.4 and yampa-test 0.14.4.
 Yampa is a fast, elegant Functional Reactive Programming implementation. Yampa prides itself in being a long-standing community project. It has now been around for 20 years!!! See https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/yampa#features for details on Yampa&#x27;s features.
 This release introduces a benchmark that can be used to evaluate the performance of a proposed change to Yampa, as well as to compare different ways of writing the same expressions. We hope that the benchmarks will improve and grow over time, and that they will help speed up the process of evaluating pull requests submitted to the project.
 Performance can be tricky to evaluate precisely, so no eyes are too many. We invite everyone to go t…</span>

 (defun org+-match-latex-marker (bound) &quot;Match instances of &#x27;LaTeX&#x27; in variable pitch and fontify. This function searches for occurrences of &#x27;LaTeX&#x27; in the buffer and fontifies them with a variable pitch font, excluding certain Org mode elements.&quot; (when (re-search-forward &quot;LaTeX&quot; bound t) (save-match-data (save-excursion (goto-char (match-end 0)) (not (memq (org-element-type (org-element-at-point)) &#x27;(src-block example-block fixed-width keyword babel-call comment comment-block clock drawer))))))) ;; This function helps to produce a single glyph out of a ;; string. The glyph can then be used in prettify-symbols-alist. ;; This function was provided by Ihor in the org-mode mailing list. (defun yant/str-to-glyph (str) &quot;Transform string into glyph, displayed correctly.&quot; (let ((composition nil)) (dolist (char (string-to-list str) (nreverse (cdr composition))) (push char composition) (push &#x27;(Br .

 I don&#x27;t want these fontifications to happen in SRC blocks (or any place that is fixed-width). It&#x27;d be nice to have the point unprettification of entities that I get with org-appear. Is there a way I can do this?

 What have other Ubuntu-users done, in this case?

                              <span>Hi, I am trying to have a simple window toggle, bound to a single key combination. I only use a single frame and generally have only one or two windows. I tried binding other-window to M-o, but when I tested it with ibuffer and a help page, it didnt switch me from the ibuffer window to the help page. Do these windows have special properties and is there a way I can account for that in my simple window switcher? 
 ​
 Thanks

 I get the error: error while checking syntax automatically: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) and no syntax checking is done. All my checkers look fine as well. Does anyone have idea what could be causing this issue? Or how I can go about finding out whats going wrong?

Hey everyone! Since we have tree-sitter now built into Emacs in the newer versions, I&#x27;ve updated evil-texobj-tree-sitter to work with the builtin treesit package. The queries are not as complete the implementation using elisp-tree-sitter, but should cover most of the common usecases. You can find more information in https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter/pull/93
 Removing hard dependency on evil-mode was one other most upvoded issue on the project and so I have added integration with thing-at-point for use without evil-mode. This happen a little while ago, but thought I would add it as well in this update.

                              <span>Hi.
 Since the update to Emacs 29 my Emacs starts very slow. It takes 6 seconds instead 1 with 28.2 to the Dashboard. C-x C-f also takes a lot longer to open a file or create a new file.
 So, probably it&#x27;s just my setup and some plugin is causing it. How could I troubleshoot what it is?

 For about 3 years or so i have tried to make emacs work for me. I always could see the potential. It was always clear to me why i should like emacs and what benefits it would give me. But it just never worked for me. From Doom over Spacemacs to emacs-from-scratch and a self writte Config based closely on what systemcrafters did, i never could make it work for my daily stuff. I would tinker for weeks, but when it came to actually doing work, i switched back to either vscode, or neovim lately.
 4 weeks or so ago i wanted to give it another go with my own setup. And by that time i realized that i mostly tried to replicate vscode or neovim in emacs. Evil mode, sidebars, explorers etc. So this time i fundamentall…</span>

 Do I still need eval-and-compile before setting the options?
 Is (require... still necessary? 
 I commented everything except the two setq lines and everything seems to work, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to encounter some side effects. 
 Can someone with more experience than me explain if that&#x27;s fine?

                              <span>I’ve had to do some PowerShell scripting at work recently, and I prefer to do all of my coding in Emacs whenever possible. I have tried various packages for PowerShell, but have found them either incomplete or unmaintained; so about two weeks ago, I decided to try and write my own package, named koopa-mode. 
 koopa-mode is a minimal major mode for PowerShell that has the following features:
  
Syntax highlighting and formatting
 The ability to spawn – and send code to – a PowerShell process in a new buffer
 Autocompletion for cmdlets
  
This is a work in progress and there are a few bugs. Nested indentation does not work as expected and there is this weird bug when using koopa-mode in Windows where autocomplete appends white space to cmdlets. I also started writing Emacs Lisp two weeks ago and have very little experience with LISP, so it is also likely my code is inefficient or just flat out awful. 
 With that said, I love Emacs and want it to thrive, and someone suggested awhile back that the best way to support Emacs is to contribute to it. I wholeheartedly welcome any code contributions or suggestions and hope someone gets some use out of this mode.

 I have pass setup and installed the password-store in my Emacs. After I used the password-store-edit command, two buffers opened. One for editing my password and another for the Async Shell Command.
 After I saved and killed the first buffer, what should I do with the 2nd buffer? Can I kill it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 5 year Engineer, starting to think about changing positions.
 Currently working in Scala but have some background in Python and JS,
 I feel very confident in my abilities as a programmer however when it comes to dynamic programming in Scala it&#x27;s a little tricky, Scala doesn&#x27;t like circuit breaks so it makes for a bit of a clunky solution when it comes to Leet-code type questions. 
 I was thinking to interview for places in Python or JS because a. my interviewer is much more likely to know one of them and b. it&#x27;s just much easier for these kind of questions... however it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;m not as fast in those languages as in my everyday work language, so that&#x27;s a big downside... 
 wdyt, should I ask to be interviewed in another language than my daily Scala?

                              <span>I am trying to convert a piece of generic Python code, that relied on dataclass metadata (kind of like reflection for Python). I am now using Scala 3, which I think has better metaprogramming capability than Scala 2 without having to use macros. However, I am still somewhat of a novice Scala programmer, especially when it comes to metaprogramming. What I want to do is, given a case class, I need to call an (applicative) function on each of its elements depending on their type and then use mapN to build an instance of the case class. 
 Probably a code sample would say it better than I can.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala //&gt; using dep &quot;org.typelevel::cats-core:2.9.0&quot; import cats.syntax.all.* import cats.Applicative
 trait Record[T]: def read[F[_]: Applicative](elemIndices: List[Int]): F[T]

                              <span>Formify is a library that converts your case classes to the &quot;x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; format, which is required by some APIs like Stripe and Twilio. The output from Formify can be passed directly to UrlForm from http4s.
 This allows you to interface with Stripe in a simple and functional manner without relying on their Java client. Just model your data as you would with Circe and POST it in the usual manner. Check it out here.
 I wrote this for an e-commerce platform and wanted to share it in case you were looking for something similar.
 Thanks, M.

                              <span>I was wondering if anyone with experience using Yesod in an enterprise setting could share best practices they’ve developed for unit / integration testing.
 The yesod-test library seems to have a lot of useful primitives to build on; I’m curious in particular about how folks…
  
initialize test db with fake data 
 mock database calls or just run tests against an in-memory PostgreSQL database
 use dependency injection to mock calls to 3rd party services within handlers
 incorporate effect systems like Polysemy &amp; Effectful into handlers
 create abstractions to make assertions on the response HTML easier
  
I can find very few writings on this topic on the web so any insights from industry would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>TL;DR: Check out this Haskell Competitive Programming Template I&#x27;ve created for solving competitive programming challenges (e.g. CodeForces). It covers splitting test cases, input parsing, and output formatting for some common patterns so that you can focus on the algorithm as a pure function.
 I am a Haskell enthuiast who likes to use Haskell for solving coding challenges in competitive programming (like in CodeForces). Over the years, I settled on a common pattern for most solutions which I wanted to share with you all. Most of the times, my main function is just parsing the input into test cases, solving each test case, and then format the output. So, all my IO resides on a single line main program where as the actual solution is a pure function from some input type to some output type.
 Formalizing this pattern in the template, I have a solve function for input type i and output type o:
 solve :: (Parser i, Formatter o) &#x3D;&gt; Splitter -&gt; Solution i o -&gt; IO () solve splitter solution &#x3D; interact $ unlines . map (format . solution . parse) . splitter . tail . lines 
 I defined 2 type classes - Parser and Formatter - to support parsing and formatting for some common input/output types. Splitter and Solution on the other hand are just type alias.
 class Parser i where parse :: [String] -&gt; i class Formatter o where format :: o -&gt; String type Splitter &#x3D; [String] -&gt; [[String]] type Solution i o &#x3D; i -&gt; o 
 I have added few useful instances for Parser and Formatter type classes, but more can be added easily. For the Splitter on the other hand, I just created couple of common splitters - fixedSizeSpliiter when each test case has fixed number of lines and dynamicSizeSpliiter when number of lines per test case can be derived from the first line of each test case.
 Feel free to share your experiences, improvements, or suggestions.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I am working on something to automatically encode Haskell datastructures as SMT bitvectors. One thing to note is that I am restricting the primitive types to just Int and Bool, this restriction is what makes this task tractable I believe. I am currently somewhat struggling with GHC.Generics.I will outline an example of what I want to achieve here:
 haskell data MyMaybeInt &#x3D; MyJustInt Int | MyNothingInt 
 Given the above, I want to encode how many bitvectors are necessary to store this particular ADT. We assume that the size of &#x60;Int&#x60; here is 32 bits.
 For this example the amount of bits needed is 33 (one bit for the tag + max bits needed of all constructors). So the equation for the number of bits needed is: num_bits_for_int(num_constructors) + max_size(constructors).

 I have some kind of love-hate relationship with Haskell since my sophomore year (2 years ago). I feel like I have invested time on it reading through textbooks and solving leet code-style problems with it, but every time I try to do any open-source work, I find myself very dumbfounded by how much I don&#x27;t understand and wrap my head around.

 I was just wondering is it really that hard or I&#x27;m doing something wrong in my approach to learn it?

                              <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;ve never tried Haskell, though I&#x27;m interested in fiddling with it due to its purity in FP.
 What are you using it for? Which personal projects have you written in Haskell?
 EDIT: After some hours in creating the project, looking at the official Haskell docs that apparently are outdated, finding that there&#x27;s no real IDE or Vs code plugin that makes programming in Haskell minimally doable, I gave up. Going to Scala, cyaaa

 0.13.1 is the latest version of glade in Hackage. However when I run stack I&#x27;m getting:
 While constructing the build plan, Stack encountered the following errors: In the dependencies for HEGlade-0.1.0.0: glade must match &gt;&#x3D;0.13.1, but the Stack configuration has no specified version (latest matching version is 0.13.1 needed since HEGlade is a build target.
 What am I doing wrong? THx in advance..

 How can I set an &quot;absolute&quot; value?

                              <span>Been running Doom for a few weeks now and loving it. I&#x27;m now trying to build a more organized note-taking system with org and org-roam.
 I recently started getting the following error message with some of my org files on startup:
 Error (org-roam): Failed to process ~/org/example_org_file.org with error Wrong type argument: integer-or-marker-p, nil, skipping... 
 It only happens on some of my files and I really don&#x27;t know why. One thing that I realized triggers the error is including URLs; deleting all URLS fixed a few of my files. But two remain. One is just a few lines of text. The other is my main index / table of contents.
 I upgraded my system today (Macbook Pro M1), so this may have caused the issue somehow, as it wasn&#x27;t present even this morning. I&#x27;m using the emacs package emacs-macm which upgraded to 29.2 yesterday. I thought that this may have caused it, because I know that Doom doesn&#x27;t officially support 29.2. But I un-installed and re-installed 28.2 via emacs-plus, and the error persists.
 Can anyone offer any help? I&#x27;m happy to provide more info.

 The following works, but I want to do this without actually modifying the function, and also by not just replacing the opt variable with the params variable that I introduced.
 ​
  (defun org-latex-special-block (special-block contents info) &quot;Transcode a SPECIAL-BLOCK element from Org to LaTeX. CONTENTS holds the contents of the block.

                              <span>Hi all
 For various corporate reasons I&#x27;m using EMACS on Windows 10, with a shared folder tree to a Vagrant VM. I tried running emacs in the VM but even with a local X server the performance isn&#x27;t great.
 I&#x27;m a &quot;lite&quot; poweruser under Linux and I have a lot of stuff like flyspell, flymake, lsp etc, Prelude, that I like to have configured.
 Now, a lot of the packages I use rely on Linux utilities (aspell, lsp server, etc) which are not available under Windows 10.
 I could possibly install cygwin but are there other options which I am overlooking? Can I get EMACS inside the VM running faster? Maybe use emacs-server? Does anyone have any suggestions to improve this configuration?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello
 I have a particular issue related to indentation when using braces and brackets inside tabular-like environments handled by AUCTeX. I am using AUCTeX 13.2.1 with Emacs 29.1.
 Things work all right within regular content. As such, the following code is correctly formatted
 latex { xxxx { zzz } } [ yyy ] 
 Custom environments are also correctly formatted
 \begin{aaaa} { xxx } [ yyy ] \end{aaaa} 
 However, tabular as well as any other tabular-like environment handled by AUCTeX does not respect indentation; here, what I mean by handled is those environments whose formatting is set to LaTeX-env-tabular as well any other environment I append using LaTeX-add-environments and set to LaTeX-env-tabular.
 As an example, as soon as talltblr is on the list handled by AUCTEX, Emacs does not indent content inside brackets
 \begin{talltblr}[ caption &#x3D; {Somthing}, label &#x3D; {tab:something}, % ... ] { colspec &#x3D; {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode&#x3D;math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} &#x3D; {font&#x3D;\bfseries}, } X &amp; X &amp; X \\\\ Y &amp; Y &amp; Y \end{talltblr} 
 I expect the following would be the correct formatting
 \begin{talltblr}[ caption &#x3D; {Somthing}, label &#x3D; {tab:something}, % ..., ] { colspec &#x3D; {Q[l] X[c,m] Q[3cm,mode&#x3D;math]}, hlines, vlines, row{1} &#x3D; {font&#x3D;\bfseries}, } X &amp; X &amp; X \\\\ Y &amp; Y &amp; Y \end{talltblr} 
 One obvious solution is to remove or not to include environments in the list. However, I really like how AUCTeX formats tables. It adds required indentation between &amp; and \\ to show where inner environments start. Hence, the code is much clearer and more readable with multiple inner and nested tabulars. The indentation would be a great addition to it.
 I ask this question in hope that perhaps someone has already sorted it out. I would also be grateful for any clues and pointers to start with.
 Thanks

 (defun emre/activate-link (start end path bracketp &amp;optional icon) &quot;Display path with a nice icon to the left of the link&quot; (save-excursion (if org-descriptive-links (add-text-properties start end (list &#x27;display (propertize (concat icon &quot; &quot; path)))) (remove-text-properties start end &#x27;(display nil))))) (org-deflink menu &quot;Style and export for menu links&quot; [:face &#x27;(:box &quot;gray60&quot; :background &quot;gray95&quot; :foreground &quot;orange&quot;)]) (org-link-set-parameters &quot;menu&quot; :activate-func (lambda (start end path bracketp) (emre/activate-link start end path bracketp &quot;\uf0c9&quot;))) (org-link-set-parameters &quot;cite&quot; :activate-func (lambda (start end path bracketp) (emre/activate-link start end path bracketp &quot;\uf02d&quot;))) (org-mode) 
 I find that it causes issues with org-appear and also that my cursor jumps out of the region after I type menu:Can this be done with compose-region instead so that it can work like prettify-symbols but keep the prettifying to inside the link?

                              <span>I am new to emacs and trying to build it from the source for native compilation. I actually want to install 28.1, as it is officially supported by doom. I have tried using emacs-plus, but it only has 28.2 and doesn&#x27;t give me a clickable app (there might be some flags here which I am unaware of). But the important thing is I am unable to get 28.1.
 Then I decided to build from source, but I am continuously getting the error:
 checking for dlfunc... no
 usage: dirname string [...]
 checking for gcc_jit_context_acquire in -lgccjit... no
 configure: error: ELisp native compiler was requested, but libgccjit was not found.
 Please try installing libgccjit or a similar package.
 If you are sure you want Emacs be compiled without ELisp native compiler,
 pass the --without-native-compilation option to configure.
 I do have libgccjit installed and added it to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. I am not quite sure why emacs is not able to find libgccjit?
 Or if there is any simpler way to install emacs 28.1 from a mirror with native compilation and all the defaults (--cask), it would be ideal.
 Let me know if any additional material is required from my end.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I just wrote a blog post trying to separate the Zettelkasten method as a note-taking method (among other things) and other note-taking methods developed for other possible purposes and with different mechanics. Basically the main argument is that any note taken in obsidian, logseq or any other &quot;digital brain&quot; app is not necessarily zettelkasten.
It is written from a somewhat fundamentalist and provocative point of view, basically because I understand that there is a commercial rise in the indication of note-taking as a miracle cure, which can be very frustrating for people who embark on setting up a Zettelkasten unnecessarily.
The article is written in Spanish, but as we all know, it can be automatically translated online using the different online translators available today.
I would like to know what you think of the proposal.

                              <span>I watched this video and it gave me the exact insight to move a step further in my approach:

I am currently using Things 3, but occasionally and begrudgingly flirt with OmniFocus. The reason is that my project are quite complex. (My TaskPaper project file for my book on habits has 447 lines and 7300 words) Things can&#x27;t meet the complexity I need. My project management is a mix of information, task, sub project, dependencies and stuff. So, I thought that I am just too unskilled using OmniFocus.
But I think just mix two concerns that should be separated.
What do you think?</span>

 Seems like the aeron UDP should be the first choice, which transport are you using.

                              <span>I&#x27;m only using the stream part at $work and sometime using the Flux/Mono for short live stream/computation , and Akka/Pekko stream for long live stream，(Java api only) .
 I find there are some operators do not exists in Akka/Pekko stream now but exists in RxJava/Flux etc , Seems people are still happy with it?
 Fs2 and ZIO have rich set of operators too.
 So what operators do you wanted but still missing?

                              <span>Backgroud:
 - the classic remoting is using netty 3.10.6 which has CVEs
 - the classic remoting code is not been touched for years
 - the new Artery is better for spliting the control message and user messages etc.
 - Akka just removed the classic transport in 2.8.0.
 ​
 There are two options now:
  
Remove it totally at the next 1.1.0 release, reduce the maintenance burden.
 Fix the CVEs by upgrade to Netty 4 in 1.1.0 but remove it in 1.2.0

                              <span>As far as I can see, the single biggest feature org-roam adds to what &quot;plain&quot; org-mode already has is back-linking.[1] I&#x27;m wondering just how useful that is in practice.
 My own (limited) experience showed that org-roam is definitely a step up from org-roam when it comes to creating back-links. But just how significant that step up is depends on how much use I&#x27;d make of those back-links when subsequently reading my org-roam nodes. And that is hard to assess without first building up a big enough set of nodes.
 So my question is addressed to those who have made a sufficiently serious move into org-roam to have built up a decent database of nodes (and, as a result, back-links). To those people my question is:
 Just how useful do you find back-links -- i.e. not the back-linking process, but the links themselves, when reading/reviewing/interacting with your notes -- to be in practice? 
 thx.
 [1] I guess searching might be a bit easier too, along with node name completion. But back-linking seems to be The Big Thing.

                              <span>I am new in emacs but have experience in vim . I was following distrotube video to config emacs . In my ~/.config/emacs/init.el i put
 (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;config.org&quot; user-emacs-directory)) 
 And I made an config.org file following him. But I got an error see in below.
  ■ Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/raihan/.config/emacs/init.el’: File is missing: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, /home/raihan/.config/emacs/config.el To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace. 
 How can I solve this?

                              <span>A lot of themes I try on emacs (macos, version 28.2, from homebrew) have weird heading styling: 
 https://preview.redd.it/i1zgvmn5p6gb1.png?width&#x3D;2934&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;ce34361d6966a1137c6cfd3acb0955e2c903c631
 The underlining only happens for some headings and starts at different places. I would like to either fix it or just remove all the underlining styling. The screenshot above is using solarized. But similar things exist for other themes:
 ​

 this is with catppuccin theme. Only some of the headings have an extra dark background.
 I tried booting emacs with the only customization being the theme and the issue still exists.
 Does anyone know how to remove or stop these themes from trying to do extra styling. Thank you

                              <span>So, with match types we can easily express &quot;type of the first tuple element&quot;:
 type FirstElement[T  head } val good: FirstElement[(String, Int)] &#x3D; &quot;yep&quot; // val badAsExpected: FirstElement[(Int, String)] &#x3D; &quot;nope&quot; // error 
 How to do the same for case classes? Using the same match type 
 case class Foo(a: String, b: Int) val wishThisWasGood: FirstElement[Foo] &#x3D; &quot;but it isn&#x27;t&quot; 
 predictably fails with match type reduction failed. It would be great to have a parity of generic programming features for tuples and case classes.
 Another related question please. I&#x27;m trying to define a match type and a corresponding function that filters elements of type String from a generic tuple. It works on type level:
 type OnlyStrings[X  EmptyTuple case x *: xs &#x3D;&gt; x match case String &#x3D;&gt; String *: OnlyStrings[xs] case _ &#x3D;&gt; OnlyStrings[xs] val works: OnlyStrings[(String, Int, String, Long)] &#x3D; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;) 
 but fails on value level:
 def onlyStrings[X  EmptyTuple // Found: EmptyTuple.type, Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case x *: xs &#x3D;&gt; x match case s: String &#x3D;&gt; s *: onlyStrings(xs) // Found: String *: std.OnlyStrings[Tuple], Required: std.OnlyStrings[X] (...) case _ &#x3D;&gt; onlyStrings(xs) // Found: (xs : Tuple), Required: X 
 this one should be fixable with a more clever type bound, right?

                              <span>Dear Zettlers,
I am currently in search for a good software solution to design visuals and diagrams for my work. Here are some examples that I made using draw.io:



For the book, Christian created more visually pleasing images:


Most of the time, I ignore my software and use the image capture function of The Archive which vastly (!) speeds up my process (important to me). The images look like this:


All images protected by copyright 4.0 (enforced by Interpol, Blackrock, the Illuminati, my secret identity and third personality). So, to the lurker who likes to &quot;borrow/bite&quot; other people ideas:

I&#x27;d like to improve my visual game.
I&#x27;d like to stop pestering Christian if I need something more pretty.
Sometimes, I use using software as a creative technique.
In few cases, I just want something pretty for myself.
And what is better than appropriate skills by just buying shiny tools? Currently, I am looking at OmniGraffle. But perhaps, you have something way better for visuals like the above?
Many thanks
Sascha</span>

                              <span>&#x27;ve set the comment color for my theme,. When I start emacs it uses the old color for comments but when I open a new frame it uses the new color. How do I fix this?
 ​
 This is the code I used.
 (custom-theme-set-faces &#x27;gruvbox-dark-hard (font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground &quot;cyan&quot;)))))

 I know the transcoding I want can be done by adding #+attr_latex: :options [name of theorem] above the special block, but I&#x27;d like to know if I can add a parameter the way I want for added convenience, maybe with the org-special-block-extras package.

                              <span>Right now the doom-modeline for Treemacs looks like the image.
 In the source code for Treemacs, I found: (doom-modeline-def-modeline &#x27;treemacs &#x27;(bar &quot; &quot; major-mode))
 But I would like to append (treemacs-workspace-&gt;name (treemacs-current-workspace)). How can I make this?
 I already tried the following, which kinda works, but I would like to add it to the use-package-statement as configuration and this doesn’t seem to work. I was wondering if someone here already has made customisations to show the current workspace-name from Treemacs in the doom-modeline.

                              <span>Hello all, I am wondering what the current state of the Web Assembly back-end is for GHC? Is the best way to compile to wasm to use the back-end from ghc-wasm-meta? Also, does anyone have any information about how to call functions written in Haskell in a browser? In my experiments with C++, one can tell emscripten to keep certain functions in the wasm binary by prefixing their return type with &quot;EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE&quot;. Is there a Haskell equivalent for this?
 EDIT: I think my answer I was looking for can be found here. It seems like this is how you get to keep haskell functions in the wasm binary. I am not entirely sure how to match up JavaScript types with Haskell&#x27;s, though.

 Learning by building projects is next phase in the learning path. And.. in my quick research I can&#x27;t find a list either. So I thought A list of Project Based tutorial would help anyone with an &#x27;appetite&#x27; for real world experience.
 tldr: caught sight of any tutorial for building projects in Haskell ? append it here... ✍️✍️

 So I was trying tio run stack so I can use ghci, however whatever I do I keep on encountering this problem
 I tried downloading the stack to use haskell in WSL, I use a kali distro and zsh, does anyone have any idea on why does it encounter this problem?
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey fell@ws!
 Probably one of the most discussed topics right after Data related ones!
 Yet, we all know things are moving at a fast pace lately.
 I am looking for a lean library without much fuss around easy to manage and set-up for a, as of rn, one man show project. 
 I came along big frameworks like &#x27;play&#x27; saw akkahttp to be very popular and of course lately Zio.http.
 Play seems to be very very big and asking for a big learning curve. Akka longs like the mongo(db) of the scala world - not really liking the direction they went w/ their licensing change which happened before I even heard of - I still do not know how to asses the risk of Zio doing it alike.
 I have only very small needs:
 -postgresql driver
 -lightweight threads
 -simple http handling
 I haven&#x27;t settled on how to server the FE yet, would be nice to find something which integrate nicely but using other tech isn&#x27;t the end of the world.
 I &#x27;just&#x27; need to have simple CRUD on the backend. 
 Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I read there are no standard libraries for that, right?
 What are you using on your backend projects and why? 
 Would be amazing to hear from you guys and your enormous experience!
 ​
 Thanks &amp; Cheeers!

                              <span>There is no doubt in my mind that I&#x27;m somehow to blame for this.... but when I make a new journal entry, it looks like this:
 * Tuesday, 08/01/2023... * Friday, 08/04/2023... ** 09:22 &lt;-- this is the one I just made * Tuesday, 07/25/2023... &lt;-- riddle me this??? 
 I use yearly format for org-journal. All entries are made in 2023-01-01.org

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m sick of writing notes to my phone. Anyone have any good workflow recommendations for a Google Pixel 7 running termux as well as a Raspberry Pi device on LAN?
 ​
 Asking since I&#x27;m debating if I should just use Emacs via Termux (although probably clunky) and just make note files that get ingested into a folder on LAN that later get slurped up and incorporated as new tasks under a &#x27;* Phone Notes&#x27; heading or something.
 I&#x27;m also planning to probably use Syncthing on LAN too somehow to facilitate the syncing.
 ​
 Curious for your thoughts thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am a medical student from Argentina. I discovered the Zettelkasten method a while ago and was very interested in it, and I wanted to introduce you to my &quot;study method&quot; (actually it is much more comprehensive than a study method).
I did this method in the format of a planner or agenda, which can be downloaded in PDF at www.researchsheets.wordpress.com
This planner has 10 sections, but the method I want to show you corresponds to &quot;section 7: Research sheets&quot;. They consist of a template similar to the Cornell method in appearance (top margin, left margin and bottom margin), but with a totally different operation, since these &quot;Research sheets&quot; will serve us to hierarchize and breake down the information, and then add it to a glossary / thesaurus in Microsoft Excel.
The procedure itself is somewhat difficult to explain, so I prefer not to confuse you further and invite you to download the planner and go directly to section 7 - Research sheets.
As I said at the beginning, I think it has some similarities with the Zettelkasten method. I hope my method is useful to you and I am available for any questions or comments.
Thank you very much for reading me!</span>

                              <span>If we are working in a monad, we can use overshadowing for a series of modifications:
 data Config &#x3D; Config { -- multiple record fields: configXXX :: YYY , (...) } modify config &#x3D; do config &lt;- m0 config config &lt;- m1 config config &lt;- m2 config -- etc. return config 
 But if we are not working in a monad:
 modify config &#x3D; let config&#x27; &#x3D; f0 config config&#x27;&#x27; &#x3D; f1 config&#x27; config&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; &#x3D; f2 config&#x27;&#x27; in config&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; 
 is confusing, it&#x27;s easy to choose the wrong config.
 So how is this pattern usually solved? Using the Identity monad&#x60;?
 Also, since this example use a datatype with multiple record fields, and maybe data in several layers, how can we uses lenses to solve the pattern? I&#x27;m not used to lenses.

                              <span>I used treesit-install-language-grammar to compile and created tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-dart.so.
 It doesn&#x27;t do anything to associate this with dart files from what I can gather. Has someone trawled through the docs and made this work with Dart? My understanding, after taking a brief overview, is that I need a dart-ts-mode and dart-mode maps to this. The creation of this mode is beyond my scope. (I had a cursory look into c-ts-mode but backed out as it doesn&#x27;t look trivial ;))
 It&#x27;s not critical to have, but since I&#x27;m doing a small flutter project I thought I&#x27;d ask.

 I have been using org babel for years. After upgrading to 29.1 and upgrading my packages I cannot run source blocks. I get the error:

                              <span>At the very bottom of the Quick Start section, it says:
  
Add any configuration which relies on after-init-hook, emacs-startup-hook, etc to elpaca-after-init-hook so it runs after Elpaca has activated all queued packages. This includes loading of saved customizations. e.g.
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name &quot;customs.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (add-hook &#x27;elpaca-after-init-hook (lambda () (load custom-file &#x27;noerror))) 
  
I don&#x27;t really use the customize feature, anyway, but my config has had the following lines in it since &quot;forever&quot;,
 (setq custom-file (expand-file-name &quot;custom.el&quot; user-emacs-directory)) (when (file-exists-p custom-file) (load custom-file)) 
 and it was never attached to any hooks. Let&#x27;s say that I did, some day, use the customize UI to customize a package in my Emacs. When would be the appropriate time to load my customizations file? Before my packages are loaded? After? What would happen if I load a customization for a package that doesn&#x27;t exist yet, because I&#x27;m at a new computer and the package is being downloaded/installed for the first time?

 I have a CSS file, and I am exporting org-mode documents using this CSS as html (the target being pdf documents). It works so far with html. I have been tweaking the CSS file so that my exported doc enforces the company style sheets and looks.
 What I am missing is my logo to be displayed in the top left corner as it would be on any company letter.
 How to instruct org-mode so that this logo is displayed properly in every page of every document.
 I guess this must be added somehow in some property in the org with the size and position ... or maybe in the CSS? I am lost, please help!
 Thanks

Don&#x27;t take them too literally and get hung up on exactly what evil and magit do/are: pretend they are package-a and package-b if that&#x27;s more helpful.
 EDIT: It was immediately brought to my attention that using magit and evil in the following example is, indeed, a poor example because of magit being autoloaded by calling magit-status. Let&#x27;s just pretend we&#x27;re talking about some other packages, instead.
 magit defines a function called magit-status, and evil defines a function called evil-ex-define-cmd, and I&#x27;d like to use it to define an ex-command for magit-status.
 So, somewhere in my init.el, I&#x27;ll have to write: (evil-ex-define-cmd &quot;git&quot; #&#x27;magit-status)

                              <span>If I had read the instructions more things would be different; maybe I love the little snippets of information gathered from failing and starting again. I now have emacs 29.1 and scimax latest running beautifully in iTerm2 ... It took three days of background tweaking, 
 I use this for opening, 
 $ emacs -nw -q -l /Users/xxxxx/.emacs.d/scimax/init.el 
 It started with I decided to upgrade to emacs 29 using Brew following JKitchin&#x27;s page, 
 I cleaned out Emacs 28 built from source, 
 I installed Emacs 29 with 
 $ brew install --cask emacs ... Worked very well, got me a useable emacs 29.1, the installation moved the emacs.app to Applications,
 Do not bother with 
 alias emacs&#x3D;&#x27;$(/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw)&#x27;
 in .zshrc.
 I upgraded to the latest scimax using Github Desktop and copying the scimax folder to 
 /Users/xxxxx/.emacs.d/scimax/ 
 There are other little bits of tweaking, but they are easy stuff. 
 Thank you for all the guidance shared,

                              <span>Hi all,
 I just switched to emacs coming from a vim background and was wondering about the integration of evil-mode into notmuch. Currently, major modes like org-mode and magit are supported thankfully (using evil-collection) but unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t come across a good way to integrated evil-mode with notmuch. Much of the bindings of notmuch and evil-mode overlap with each other, thus hampering the bindings of notmuch. Currently, I&#x27;m just disabling evil-mode in every notmuch buffer and am using the standard emacs bindings.
 So as per the title, is there a way to integrated notmuch and evil-mode? Or perhaps use just a subset of evil-mode in a notmuch buffer (like simple &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; for moving around for example).
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I usually run Xtoolkit based Emacs (the version without any gtk code at all) and it runs perfectly fine. I&#x27;ve tried the old GTK version and the Webrender fork in the past and now recently tried the pGTK version. They all run extremely slowly. I don&#x27;t have exact measurements but were talking ballpark half a second for anything to happen when I hit a key. It gets much better when I disable transparency but it&#x27;s still far, far behind the X toolkit version.
 Based on what I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere I was expecting the pGTK version to be faster (like the tui version which is noticeably better than X) or at the very least equivalent with the X toolkit version.
 I installed Emacs via nix from the emacs-overlay.
 What am I doing wrong that it&#x27;s so slow?

                              <span>Hi, I am creating a new org-roam-capture template named &quot;history&quot;, and I want to choose from several existing files to insert my content into: - the content is history elements (date + what has been done + todos...) - the target files are files that I must choose from, even based on a Tag (filetags?), or from another property that I can create (#+type: customer). At the end I want to select as a target a file from the list of files with this special property and insert under the block * History
 What would be the best approach here, to have the file selected in the minibuffer (fuzzy matching) used as a target in the capture template?
 Thanks for your ideas

                              <span>I feel like there&#x27;s been tons of threads on this topic but they just left me feeling more unsure after looking through them. Here are my concerns which mostly revolve around Org-mode:
  
CommonMark vs Org-mode for writing only? I feel like the only advantage of the Org syntax are footnotes and tables.
 
Is the Org syntax set in stone? Like if I don&#x27;t use any advanced features or extensions will my org files be fine with future updates to Org-mode? I have heard stories of org files being outdated and breaking.
 
Does large org files get slow (50k-70k words though I doubt my files will ever get that big)? 
 
Reference management on Emacs vs Neovim? 
 
Is exporting from Org-mode to Docx easy? According to this article there&#x27;re still issues with the final output Docx files sadly, cause then I will have to open up Pages to fix them which may cause further formatting issues.
 
Org on Emacs vs Org on Neovim?
 
Is Emacs or Neovim better for LaTeX?
 
Is Emacs much slower than Neovim? I only plan to open it when working on a project and not to take notes all the time so a bit slow startup time is acceptable - being slow while working is unacceptable though.
 
Is Emacs high maintenance?
 
 And if I do choose to use Emacs, should I use Doom-Emacs or just the vanilla config files - I heard Doom disabled some obsolete settings which make it faster/the same speed despite having pre-installed extensions?

                              <span>I have been working with orgmode every day for two years now and I love it. Recently, I switched from using tables to using column view for some use cases, and there are many advantages for me in that. What I am missing in column view is hl-line-mode. Sometimes it is difficult for me when being at the far right with the cursor, to see in the far left what line I am in and what values correspondent to the ones in the far right.
 Hl-line-mode is turned on, but it doesn&#x27;t highlight the current line when in column view. Does anyone of you know of a way to make it work? Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hello /r/scala,
 sorry for asking you to do my job, but I&#x27;m trying to assess how much &quot;future proof&quot; is a scala codebase we inherited that we are interested in making the primary product for my company. I just studied a bit the language (and I loved it), observed the ecosystem and lurked here and somewhere else, but I&#x27;m not able to do this kind of risk assessment on my own as I might be influenced by some echo-chamber effect. I&#x27;m also incredibly sorry for being not precise in my descriptions, again I&#x27;m not super familiar with the ecosystem.
 The codebase has around 6-7 years I guess, and it&#x27;s a Scala 2 100k LoC web api backend based on a Play multiproject setup (many folders with an sbt project inside + a sbt project outside in the root folder, no src/main/scala structure).
 The signatures…</span>

                              <span>I just joined a group on LinkedIn yet there is nothing much going on apart from spams and scala unrelated this from recruiters who not think scala is any different to Scala and as a Scala dev you might prefer to work with express.. Anyhow :D
 I heard scala has an amazing community and I happy to join it as of right now!
 I recently was looking for a new stack for my next webapp projects. After working with golang for some weeks I was just frustrated on how bad the documentation is. As a former Java Developer I felt home right away with scala. Considering that I heavily do in data engineering and not being a fan of the Python Syntax and especially not pip I might found my swiss-army-knife with Scala!
 Still getting around with this massive eco-system. especially since it seems like it works just fine with every Java related (such as frameworks, libs) I throw at my scala projects it will just do fine.
 I am also very excited to know that there are even Javascript and LLVM compiler to run system target bins.
 Seems like one language/ecosystem to rule them all. 
 How did you end up here?
 I mean kotlin does also make bold claims and golang is super hip, isn&#x27;t it?

 I know for Neovim there’s a couple solid resources like these:

                              <span>Org Babel (Shell) in a session ends up truncating output from the shell.
 MWE:
 test.py:
 #!/usr/bin/env python3 print(&quot;&quot;&quot; Stats: CPU Busy 24 (100.00%) Stats: IO Busy 15 (62.50%) Stats: Total Time Busy 24 (100.00%) &quot;&quot;&quot;) 
 test.org:
 #+begin_src shell :session test :results output ./test.py #+end_src #+RESULTS: : : ) : ) : ) 
 It seems like it ignores everything before %, which is rather surprising. I tried removing the %, and everything worked fine.
 Tested on Emacs 27.1 and Emacs master, Ubuntu Jammy (22.04), using emacs -q.
 edit: Also tested on Termux (Emacs 28.3), similar behaviour. Interestingly, I tried catting the file, and it also mangles the shebang by skipping the #, which is doubly weird.
 edit 2: New MWE: test.org:
 #+begin_src shell :session test :results output echo &quot;Hello world#&quot; #+end_src #+RESULTS: :

I&#x27;d prefer if an empty line was added in-between instead. I&#x27;d also only want this to happen in the case where two pieces of text are on consecutive lines. Does anyone know how I can adapt things for this case?

 Ive purged all repos and build dirs and rebuilt but launching mu4e in emacs gives the error above. Any pointers gratefully received. (I tried 1.10 too but same issue).

                              <span>Hi Emacs community,
 I am trying to recreate the RStudio layout for the ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) mode. This is I want to improve the ESS module in doom (here it is the feature branch).
 I have made good progress, but I&#x27;m currently stuck on one aspect.
 Here&#x27;s the code I have so far:
 (defun my-rstudio-layout () &quot;&quot; (interactive) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*help\\[R\\]&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*xwidget-webkit*.&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . 1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*R.*\\*&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-at-bottom) (window-width . 0.5) (dedicated . t))) (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist &#x60;(&quot;^\\*R dired\\*&quot; (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (slot . -1) (window-width . 0.33) (reusable-frames . nil))) (let ((ess-startup-directory &#x27;default-directory) (ess-ask-for-ess-directory nil)) (delete-other-windows) (ess-switch-to-ESS t) (ess-help &quot;help&quot;) (ess-rdired))) 
 My problem is with the xwidget buffer. I would like it to open in the same window as the help buffer, using a tab (activating tab-bar-mode, of course). 
 I aim to achieve something similar to this: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/images/RStudio_Screenshot_Labels.png
 Would anyone know how I could achieve this? I&#x27;ve been struggling to figure out how because the manual isn&#x27;t clear about what variables we can use in the display-buffer-alist. 
 Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance! 
 PS. Any other suggestions or hints about this function are also appreciated.

Playing it safe, I left out everything but --tree-sitter and it worked without errors. Any ideas what was wrong, what better to do?

                              <span>Hey all,
 To preface, I am brand new to emacs and am currently exploring what it has to offer. I setup a simple init.el file like so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ;; Set up package.el to work with MELPA (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 ;; Download Evil (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;evil) (package-install &#x27;evil))
 ;; Download Catppuccin (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;catppuccin-theme) (package-install &#x27;catppuccin-theme))
 ;; Enable Evil (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1)
 ;; Enable Catppuccin (load-theme &#x27;catppuccin :no-confirm) (setq catppuccin-flavor &#x27;mocha) (catppuccin-reload)
 (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. &#x27;(package-selected-packages &#x27;(catppuccin-theme evil))) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. ) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It works perfectly on Ubuntu running under WSL, it does not quite work on straight Windows 11. On Windows 11 it does set the theme to Catppuccin so I know it&#x27;s sourcing the init.el file correctly but it evil mode doesn&#x27;t start working until after I manually toggle it via (M-x evil-mode)
 Also, if it makes a difference, I am using 28.2 on both WSL and straight Windows. 
 It&#x27;s just a minor inconvenience but if there is something I am missing that will fix it then I am all ears.

                              <span>Today I have upgraded my emacs to 29 from 28 and got a lot of packages complaining after fresh download from elpa. I use custom emacs with doom theme and lots of other packages, namely counsel, ivy, lsp, projectile, some minor ones. Suddenly, lsp started to complain a lot with warnings, projectile stopped running my projects with qemu (but pure terminal works), a lot of other problems -- warnings in different packages. What are the basic steps I need to check after an upgrade? Yes, I have downloaded all packages from scratch but problems are still there.
 Right now, the most annoying thing is the way I run qemu with tun/tap interface enabled. If I run from separate console, my project starts as expected. If I run it as a command for projectile/run, qemu cannot open tap interface (resource is busy). Manual check of env in console/projectile does not show any significant differences.
 Edit: a bit more details

                              <span>The previous tree-sitter package was just a minor mode, and this made it much easier to migrate to and use. Having a new major mode means that all hooks, key-bindings, major-mode checks, use-package’s, derived modes, and config need to be duplicated twice. And it&#x27;s not only your own user config, but all packages need to add support for each new mode, even if they don&#x27;t care about tree-sitter. 
 Given that, the core developers must have had good reasons for not going the minor-mode route. Does anyone know some of the trade-offs that were considered? Maybe a link to the Devel discussion about it?

 This will signal an error caused by the endless lambda macro expansion.
 Quote it

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 is a good idea, but ... then we cannot use lexical binding.
 They ((lambda ...) and &#x27;(lambda ...)) are different; as you can see:
 lisp &#x27;(lambda ()) ;; &#x3D;&gt; (lambda nil) (lambda ()) ;; &#x3D;&gt; (closure (t) nil) 
 Modify the byte-code

 Ah! Nice~ We can replace the placeholder _. Let&#x27;s take advantage of vector&#x27;s self-quotation:

 However, I usually don&#x27;t notice until I compile the file, which tells me that I have a n or p somewhere and have to track it down, and there&#x27;s not always a line number. 
 If I use I-search-forwards these accidentally inserted characters are hard to track down, because there are so many legitimate uses of n and p
 Does anyone have any ideas on a way to make catching these rascals easier?

                              <span>I feel like this is probably down to me not being too good with lisp, so maybe someone can point out my error. The idea is, that i want to create an svg-tag (Package), that opens a URL on click. That&#x27;s the part i&#x27;ve got working. But now, the tag itself should be part of the url, which i can&#x27;t get to work.
 So, this works
  (setq svg-tag-tags (&quot;\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda () (interactive) (browse-url &quot;https://jira.internal.de/browse/&quot;)) &quot;Open in Browser&quot;)) )) 
 But this doesn&#x27;t
  (setq svg-tag-tags (&quot;\\(ASGUPD\-[#0-9]+\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag)) (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat &quot;https://jira.internal.de/browse/&quot; tag))) &quot;Open in Browser&quot;)) )) 
 This is what i have come up with so far. When running this i get the Error
  Wrong number of arguments: (lambda (tag) (interactive) (browse-url (concat &quot;https://elara-jira.elara-gmbh.de/browse/&quot; tag))), 0 
 I&#x27;m not sure if the tag is even available at that point. I assumed that it would work the same as creating the tag. Am i doing something obviously wrong?

                              <span>In order to have a more comfortable keyboard layout I&#x27;ve switched the Crtl key with the Alt key and Alt with Win-logo key using xmodmap. This makes transitioning between my Ubuntu desktop and Macbook pretty seemless and doesn&#x27;t kill my little finger. ;)
 In Emacs 27 this worked fine, Emacs 29 thinks I&#x27;m hitting multiple keys when pressing Alt or Win-logo.
 Alt+x should be C-x but I get A-C-x
 Win-logo+x should be: M-x but is M-s-x 
 How can I fix this?
 My init.el has these changes to make it work in previous versions of emacs:
 ;; xfce key-bindings
 (setq x-meta-keysym &#x27;super
 x-super-keysym &#x27;meta)
 ;; use fn key as control, maps better to my dasKeyboard setup
 (setq ns-function-modifier &#x27;control)
 This is the content of my .xmodmap file:
 clear control
 clear mod1
 clear mod4
 keycode 133 &#x3D; Super_L
 keycode 64 &#x3D; Alt_L
 keycode 37 &#x3D; Control_L
 remove control &#x3D; Control_L
 remove mod4 &#x3D; Super_L
 remove mod1 &#x3D; Alt_L
 add control &#x3D; Alt_L
 add mod1 &#x3D; Super_L
 add mod4 &#x3D; Control_L

 which is great by the way, the maintainer is very active and helpful.
  
The problem I have stems from 29.0 and I searched here and it was said that the message is harmless and not doing anything, but it uses CPU every time and it&#x27;s definitely doing something:

 The 15th Haskell Implementors&#x27; Workshop is to be held alongside ICFP 2023 this year in Seattle. It is a forum for people involved in the design and development of Haskell implementations, tools, libraries, and supporting infrastructure to share their work and to discuss future directions and collaborations with others.
 We have a number of slots for lightning talks. Lightning talks will be ~7 minutes and are scheduled on the day of the workshop. Suggested topics for lightning talks are to present a single idea, a work-in-progress project, a problem to intrigue and perplex Haskell implementors, or si…</span>

 I checked with Scala, and Scala behaves exactly in the way he described as not optimal or as a bug/wart. 
 For more information, see the comment here

 Anyone knows why Scala behaves this way? Or if this is indeed objectively a wart or it is a subjective thing.

https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/experience-machine
I never read anything by Andy Clark, and didn&#x27;t know his book &quot;the extended mind&quot; -- but for obvious reasons, since we&#x27;re all here on zettelkasten.de, the concept sounds interesting 
Anyone here who can recommend one of these books?</span>

                              <span>By default links to other org files would open in other windows which was mostly fine. It got really annoying when doing a lot of org-roam link following so I changed it from &#x60;file . find-file-other-window&#x60; to &#x60;file . find-file&#x60;. HOWEVER I now sometimes would like to be able to open a link in another window. 
 Funny how that is....emacs user wants nuanced control. Are there any existing packages or easy elisp to enable this type of function? Was low key hoping it would work with C-u C-c C-o but that was a no go.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed what I think is a (mildly annoying) change in the way org-capture uses the %? escape to position point in a capture buffer. But it might be I&#x27;ve changed something else that is creating the effect. I&#x27;d appreciate opinions.
 The TL;DR is as follows.
 My capture templates usually end with \n%?. That is intended to position point on a new line in the capture buffer, ready for me to type in whatever text I want. And it has always done exactly that. However, what I now see is that where I have a template that clocks in, AND if I am storing clock info in a drawer, then that positioning goes awry. Instead of point being positioned at the start of a new line, it is placed right on top of the clock drawer. That forces me to manually move the cursor down before starting to type. (I know;…</span>

                              <span>I use mu4e with smtpmail-send; smtpmail-send-it can read the credentials from auth-source by default however mbsync (and other indexing utilities) requires using passcmd or the psas itself. Even if you were to use sed or awk to make the passcmd work with .authinfo (to avoid duplicating the password), you will not be using the emacs interface promot to enter the password but gpg’s.
 Here is what i’ve been doing instead, I’ve this elisp function;
 (require &#x27;auth-source) (defun salih/get-mail-password () (let* ((auth-info (auth-source-search :host &quot;mail.gmx.com&quot; :require &#x27;(:user :secret))) (password (funcall (plist-get (car auth-info) :secret)))) password)) 
 It will return the password associated with the host. If the file is encrypted you are promoted to enter your passphrase with epa.
 Since I run emacs as a daemon, we can eval this function in the command line like this emacsclient -e &quot;(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))&quot; you will be promoted in the emacs session you are running.
 If you run this in a shell it is going to return the password with double quotes, but we can workaround that using simple string substitution in the shell. here is the final script;
 #!/usr/bin/env sh output&#x3D;&quot;$(emacsclient -e &quot;(let ((inhibit-message t)) (salih/get-mail-password))&quot;)&quot; output_without_quotes&#x3D;&quot;${output//\&quot;/}&quot; echo &quot;$output_without_quotes&quot; 
 And in mbsync config (isyncrc):

                              <span>Hi folks,
 Any reason why Emacs would not detect packages when I list them but they are visible under melpa package listing: Example is &quot;dirvish&quot; package that does not list in Emacs but it&#x27;s visible on Melpa site.
 My config for packages is
 (setq package-archives
 &#x27;((&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;)
 (&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)
 (&quot;gnu-devel&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/&quot;)
 (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;)
 (&quot;elpa&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;)
 (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;)))
 ​
 (package-initialize)
 (unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents))
 (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;use-package)
 ​
 ; Unless &quot;use-package&quot; is installed, install &quot;use-package&quot;
 (package-install &#x27;use-package))
 ​
 (require &#x27;use-package)
 (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
 ​
 Wonder if I&#x27;m missing something or perhaps the order of packages is wrong ? 
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey, ya&#x27;lls.
 Recently left Spacemacs in favour of rolling my own config for a variety of reasons. It took me a few weeks to put together. There were a lot of people that said, &quot;you can just put something together in the space of a weekend&quot;; that was very much NOT the case for me, having gotten used to functionality from Spacemacs, and also wanting certain things.
 Anyway, this is the first time I&#x27;ve put something like this together, and I&#x27;d love if anyone felt like taking a look and offering some criticisms/insights.
 Org file found over here.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a package (at least asking if anyone knows of one before I write one myself) to make space indented code behave like tab indented code, specficially the variable width part. So I can for example have a file of four space indented code and make it display like two or eight spaces.

 Turns &#x60;camelCaseTyping&#x60; into &#x60;camel_Case_Typing&#x60; (visually only) and of course its customizable.
 Will be trying it out on Javascript files and will be configuring some options.
 Not sure how handy it&#x27;ll be but have sometimes wished I was able to do this when I&#x27;m spending all day in JS land.

 So, with latest emacs 30 on Windows 11 and Powershell 7, do i have any chance to get a terminal in emacs, or will i need to rely on another terminal for that?

 lsp-mode
 If my mouse pointer is over my lsp buffer then keyboard chords using lsp-keymap-prefix fail. In this video you will see my mouse near to the cursor. I hit C-l (my prefix) then shift and it bugs out with mouse movement errors. If I do the exact same thing with the mouse NOT over the buffer it works. This is both with and without lsp-ui-doc-mode on.
 Has anyone witnessed anything similar?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to have a &quot;mix&quot; between avy-goto-char-timer (which at the moment is the only thing I use from avy as it&#x27;s so great) and avy-goto-char-in-line, where the search scope is the current line. That is, I often need to jump somewhere in the current line, and I wish to type until the match is unique, at which point the jump should be performed automatically (like the former command already does). I could just use avy-goto-char-timer, but it would show all other matches in the buffer, so making it unique is harder and sometimes impossible, so I have to press the target key(s).
 Looking at the implementations, I&#x27;m a bit stuck though, as avy-goto-char-in-line uses avy-jump for scoping, which is based on regexes, but avy-goto-char-timer gets the candidate list with avy--read-candidates, where I don&#x27;t see how I would scope to the current line (and which looks harder to extend, as it&#x27;s quite complex). Is there an easy way I&#x27;m overlooking?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a small PowerShell major mode, and I am trying to create the fontification for multi-line comments using a syntax table.
 This is the code I have, which kind of works:
 ;; Comment syntax:  denotes a multi-line comment (modify-syntax-entry ?\ &quot;&gt; 4&quot; st) 
 It successfully comments out the lines
  
 But unfortunately also comments out the 10 in $x &lt; 10.
 I have not been able to find any good examples in either the documentation or SO, but the documentation on syntax tables seems to indicate this would be the correct approach.

                              <span>When trying to use tree-sitter modes I run into many silly problems.
 Take c-mode for example:
  
References to c-mode-hook.
 Key bindings that reference c-mode-map.
 use-package references to c-mode.
 My own functions that check: (member major-mode &#x27;(c-mode c++-mode objc-mode))
 Basically my whole configuration assumes C/C++ use c-mode or c++-mode and having to add checks for c-ts-mode is a hassle, enough that I don&#x27;t use c-ts-mode at all.
  
Is there some solution that doesn&#x27;t involve every check for c-mode also checking for c-ts-mode ?

 So I’m new to haskell so please bear with me for this silly question. I was doing some haskell using GHC 9.2.7 installed by ghcup. Then today I installed and set ghc 9.6.2 and cabal 3.10.1.0 and my simple toy programs don’t work anymore because libraries such as Data.Map are not found anymore.
 I thought they were part of the prelude? What am I missing? 
 Also follow up question: why is ghcup recommending me old versions of compiler and tools instead of the latest one? I’m using ubuntu 18.04 of that helps
 Thanks a lot to however take the time to help me :)

                              <span>Hi fellow Haskellers! I&#x27;m new to the functional programming world and wanted to give creating a Blackjack program a shot.
 Here&#x27;s the code
 Any comments or critiques are welcome! I do have a few specific areas for feedback:
  
When inserting a State function in the StateT function, I have to use something like
 (a,s)  get
 put s
 
 which seems very clunky. Is there a better pattern to use?
  
I couldn&#x27;t figure out a clean way for hands that are split to disqualify from being blackjacks. Any ideas?
 
I&#x27;m not super fluent in testing. How do I test IO portions of the code? Such as my function Actions.getValidTurnActions which requires the user to input a line.
 
 Thanks for taking a look at a beginner&#x27;s code. Much appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Emacs 29 on a Debian machine with Xorg. When I select a piece of text with the mouse in Org mode and then press &#x27;M-w&#x27; to copy the text, Emacs successfully copies the text, but the highlighted selection remains in an odd color that doesn&#x27;t go away, almost like it was highlighted in yellow or some other unusual color. I&#x27;m unsure of the cause of this issue, and it&#x27;s difficult to reproduce as it only happens occasionally. I&#x27;m not sure what might be causing it. Have you ever experienced anything like this? do you know what it might be linked to so I can tweak my Emacs config?

                              <span>So org transclusion lets you display/link sections of other org files into your current file and it updates in real time. 
 I&#x27;m loving it in general for text that sort of &quot;lives on&quot; but I have a use case in my productivity system where I want to transclude from a file I use every week but it changes. So I need to embed the transclusion as a part of my end of week review. 
 Currently I have to:
  
Delete the transclusion
 Go to the running weekly tracking file
 copy/refile it into my 5 daily files that are long term stored 
 delete it from the running weekly tracking file. 
  
What I would like to be able to do i.e. a sort of baking in of the source to everywhere it is linked. 
  
Go to the source of the transclusion
 search for the use of this heading as a transclusion across my org files
 overwrite the transclusion with the actual text. 
  
Before I go writing the custom elisp for this which seems like a bear. I wanted to confirm if anyone knows a simple way to achieve this.

                              <span>Hello there,
 ​
 I have a function which I want to handle a empty yield : 
 for {
 x &lt;- myParam.myOption
 y &lt;- myParam.mySecondOption
 z &lt;- myParam.myValue
 }yield {
 // bunch of manipulation
 } 
 My probelm is this return an Option of my result that i cant manipulate. I was under the impression thta I could use a recover, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Is there a way of returning an error if one of the value ends up empty ?

                              <span>Since 29.1 has been released, I was hoping for a quick release of emacs-mac (aka Mitsuharu&#x27;s Mac port). In the past, an update has followed the official release by a couple of days only. 
 I looked at the official repo and brew emacs-mac formula, and both show no recent activity. Can anyone in the know update us?

                              <span>Unfortunately, some packages think a symlink file is different from the one it links to. eg Treemacs follow wont work if the treemacs workspace says &quot;symlink/file.txt&quot; but the file opened is &quot;~/long/path/file.txt&quot;. Understandable. Now I dont know the ins and outs of that complexity but certainly my use case would be simplified if consult-buffer could be configured to ignore the longer path so I dont open that file via the long path and the buffer indeed has a reference of ~/symlink/file.txt. eg see here , a picture makes it easier to understand : I&#x27;d like to see one or the other filtered so I can have some concistency in my buffer opening.
 Can anything be done or is there something already available? Or do I just need to suck it up and be more careful as to what path I use?

 How can I copy the error message from the LSP error on the right side, once I tried to copy the message using Mouse the message just disappeared, I need to search for the error in Google. 
 Even from Project Error List in SPC-P-X, I can&#x27;t copy the error details.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to create a my first major-mode for HTTP requests in emacs, I&#x27;m stuck at the syntax coloring for regexs at the same line.
 let this be the HTTP request I&#x27;m trying to highlight:
 GET /print_hello_world HTTP/2.0 host: mydomain.com te: trailers sec-fetch-site: cross-site sec-fetch-mode: no-cors sec-fetch-dest: image accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br accept-language: en-US,en;q&#x3D;0.5 accept: image/avif,image/webp,*/* {&quot;hello&quot; :&quot;world&quot;} 
 now in the first line want to highlight the first line GET with a face and the endpoint /print_hello_world with another face I tried using:
 (setq font-lock-defaults &#x27;(,((rx line-start (or &quot;GET&quot; &quot;POST&quot;) symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric punct)) symbol-end space) . &#x27;my-http-endpoint-font) ,((rx line-start symbol-start (or &quot;GET&quot; &quot;POST&quot;) symbol-end) . &#x27;my-http-method-font))) 
 but this will only highlight the method not the endpoint.
 the same goes for header values, I tried using this:
 (setq font-lock-defaults &#x27;((,(rx line-start symbol-start (one-or-more (any alphanumeric ?- ?_)) symbol-end &quot;: &quot;) . &#x27;my-http-header-key-face ) (,(rx &quot;: &quot; symbol-start (one-or-more not-newline) symbol-end eol) . &#x27;my-http-header-value-face ))) 
 this will highlight only the header with its face but not the value.
 I tried to check python-mode for how it is done but I didn&#x27;t understand how it is structuring it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use emacs in client/server mode by running emacs --daemon --nw at login and then running emacsclient -c to open new frames.
 After upgrading Arch linux this morning to emacs 29.1, my clients can no longer find the socket to connect to emacs. The daemon command runs and outputs the usual startup messages, but it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t finish loading fully and never executes the daemon.
 I tried emacs -q --daemon --nw and this worked, so the problem is in my init somewhere. Ugh.
 I tried --debug-init but it found no problems. The only output I get in Messages is:
 Error loading autoloads: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory /home/alanm/.emacs.d/elpa/yaml-mode-20230714.440/yaml-mode-autoloads) Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/orgmode_customizations.el (source)...done Loading /home/alanm/.emacs.d/email.el (source)...done Turning on magit-auto-revert-mode...done For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a. Package cl is deprecated 
 I&#x27;m not sure what is trying to load cl. It&#x27;s nowhere in my config, and the only cl- packages I have installed show as builtins. Not sure what&#x27;s up with yaml-mode, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s it because the problem was happening before I updated yaml. I&#x27;ve also tried commenting out my orgmode and email external .el files, and that didn&#x27;t help, so the issue is in the init file directly.
 I can run server-start in an emacs window and then connect, but I&#x27;d like to have a background daemon running instead.
 Any ideas? Here is my init.el, if it helps: https://pastebin.com/GNzhwcqU

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the mac os upgrade to torch my emacs (sigh). I&#x27;m gun shy on just upgrading emacs ala brew because I don&#x27;t wind to wind up going down the &quot;fix up&quot; rabbit hole when I&#x27;m trying to get work done... so looking here for someone to tell me the latest brew emacs is all good for the latest mac before I take the plunge.
 (I was so happy emacs was getting tamed, really wasn&#x27;t expecting this kind of interaction... is this common on mac os upgrades?)
 Thanks for any info or tips. (I&#x27;m trying to stay as vanilla as possible in my emacs setup).
 ​
 EDIT: After googling around I found mention of this being fixed in the 29 branch. But also found a one liner fix to avoid upgrading in flow. So, for anyone else hitting this:
 (add-to-list &#x27;image-types &#x27;svg)
 will do the trick.

 I configured and used org-roam, but I wonder if a simple set of Markdown files could be better, more portable, and easier to synchronize between my work laptop and my home computer.
 Do you have any experience? How you implemented your Zettelkasten? And how you synchronize among different systems?

 To be able to bind C-i differently from  in GUI, I had the following snippet, it works. But I have never properly understood how/why
 (define-key input-decode-map &quot;\C-i&quot; [C-i]) (global-set-key [C-i] (lambda()(interactive)(message &quot;Ctrl + I&quot;))) 
 Now, define-key is flagged as obsolete, replaced by keymap-set.
 However I can&#x27;t seem to make the same lines work with keymap-set. I have tried replacing [C-i] by &quot;&quot; since (kbd &quot;) returns [C-i], but it does not pass the is-valid-key-p check.
 Any key-binding guru here, ready to settle the matter and help me and others understand the proper way to achieve this with the new API ?
 I know I could leave it as is, or rebind stuff to Hyper-I, but that&#x27;s not a satisfying answer
 Thanks !

I&#x27;m noticing that it&#x27;s always in fundamental mode even when I open .ts and .rs files. So eglot doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to detect the language server. What am I missing? How is one supposed to use these new features?

 I have no idea what could cause this and more importantly, how to turn it off. I would be grateful for any ideas on this issue!

                              <span>Hello, can anyone help me choose between neovim and emacs? I know what I want from an editor and am ready to spend a lot of time customizing one of these editors, but I don&#x27;t want to do it twice. So I will tell my preferences and it would be really great to get your advice.
  
I prefer to use an editor in terminal, without additional gui. As far as I know neovim is tui app, while emacs is not. However, I can run emacs in my terminal. How much I lost not using gui version of emacs?
 
I want to create and edit notes and to-do&#x27;s using an editor. I am not going to use it as a calendar as I prefer to use apple calendar on my macbook and iphone. How many advantages does org-mode have over simple md? Also I&#x27;ve read about org-mode for neovim...
 
I want to try to use an editor as ide too. I&#x27;m angular developer and I&#x27;m working on rather large project (main project contains about 7k files). I&#x27;m worried about the performance of the autocomplete. Unfortunately, I failed to find ready-made configs for emacs and neovim to open the project and see for myself.
 
I definitely don&#x27;t want to use my editor as browser, gaming platform, email client, window manager etc etc. Honestly, looks like neovim is winner here :)
 
I don&#x27;t want to use something like spacemacs, emacs-doom, etc., just self-written configs. And I don&#x27;t know what is better in this case - elisp or lua/vimscript.
 
I have no preference between emacs or vim hotkeys. Both are good.
 
Emacs startup time is significantly worse than neovim&#x27;s, even though I have very few plugins installed. Can I fix it without using client-server? It&#x27;s not a big problem, but it&#x27;s annoying.
 
 So i&#x27;m looking for a lightweight and fast editor for notes and development on angular. Should I spend my time on emacs or neovim? Thanks for your opinion and sorry for my english, I&#x27;m not native.

                              <span>Hi, new emacs user here. I&#x27;m having difficult time on how to use colemak on emacs. That means, my emacs installation on Windows Subsystem for Linux still using qwerty layout instead of colemak layout; and I want to have colemak layout when using emacs. On the Windows host as well as the WSL Ubuntu distribution, I&#x27;m having colemak layout. Though whenever I type something to emacs, it&#x27;s always qwerty. So I&#x27;m looking for help on how to tackle this.
 Thanks.

 The other day I wrote a simple Haskell program that retrieves data from a REST API and processes it. The task at hand sounded simple enough to just start coding without too much upfront thinking.
 This blog post is about how I discovered the shortcomings of my original design and how I improved it with some simple refactorings.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 ​
 I come from Rmarkdown, trying to reproduce some of my previous workflow. I made most everything the way I wanted. However, I like to keep html reports from my analyses, in rmarkdown I would generate standalone html files, ie, they dont point to png plots outside of the file, the plots are embedded in the html.
 ​
 - Is there a way to do this in orgmode export? So that the resulting html is including the plots, instead of pointing to the files locally?
 ​
 Thank you!
