                    <span>tl;dr use Emacs to write scientific LaTeX, want good non-obtrusive grammar-checker. Anyone who use Emacs for LaTeX frequently have any experience?
 I use Emacs for writing scientific texts in LaTeX, and so a spell checker/grammar checker is obviously important. I have yet to find a solution that I am happy with, so I would like to hear if anyone has some good suggestions.
 I have earlier used flyspell, but it falls short compared to Grammarly, LanguageTool and Trinka, as it only corrects words, and has no &quot;contextual&quot; understanding.
 I have tested lsp-ltex, which worded quite well, but I found it way too intrusive. Sure, I could probably have gotten it to work if i tinkered enough, but I feel like something so essential as a spell checker should be simple. For reference, below are two other threads related to this, but I did not find the answers there satisfactory; in particular I feel like many of the solutions are made for pure programming languages, and then bodged together to work with LaTeX.

                    <span>Hi! 
 I&#x27;m a regular Emacs user, testing the version 28 for some months ago (right now in 28.0.90). 
 Looking at the git repo and the devel mailing list, I was wondering if there are criteria/policies/requirements to declare a branch stable enough to be released. 
 The nearest example is, of course, Emacs 28, but I don&#x27;t know if there are some guidelines for any future release (28.2, 29, etc). 
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Title says it. Looking for a keyboard with relatively small space bar / more space for modifiers which can be pressed with thumbs.
 On my keyboard now with left thumb i can press comfortably first closest to space bar modifier, somewhat comfortably second closest to space modifier; with right thumb even first closest to space modifier is not comfortable.
 Priorities
 - portable
 - reasonably priced
 Usage - programming / typing
 OS - windows / android
 ​
 Options i am considering:
 - JIS (japanese) layout keyboard
 - ?remapping trackpad mouse buttons on thinkpad keyboard?

I tried with some images I found on the internet and it worked, I tried to create my own using canva.com and it didn&#x27;t work (both svg). It looks like a svg problem to me, when I open and view the code of these svg&#x27;s the one I created and exported has a slightly strange ending. Do you know where there is a good place to create these images with the &quot;real svg&quot;?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to figure what is done to figure out the searched symbol name when xref-find-definitions is called.
 The problem is the following. When I&#x27;m in org mode and in elisp source code block I try to use xref-find-definitions when my cursor is located on a string &quot;;; &#x60;own-variable&#x27;&quot;. Then emacs says &quot;no definitions found for &quot;own-variable&#x27;&quot;. So it somehow falsely thinks that the final single quote is also part of a symbol name. How do I find what is being used to decide what&#x27;s the searched symbol name?
 I tried profiling, and debug-on-entry for xref-find-definitions but that seems to be too late. The symbol name is already been made.
 I have an impression that Org mode uses &quot;pcomplete-completions-at-point&quot; for this completion but I did not manage to use debug-on-entry for that. I found the pcomplete-completions-at-point function by evaluating &quot;completion-at-point-functions&quot; in the buffer.
 Any tips would be welcome.
 EDIT: I&#x27;m able to jump to the definition with the following combination: M-x find-variable RET RET.

                    <span>I am using Emacs 28.0.90 and lsp-mode for Go. Most things are working, but packages imported from a github URL are not being found. For example, in the following code there is no trouble finding things from the fmt, os, or time packages, but I get complaints about the other three packages. 
 import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;os&quot; &quot;time&quot; &quot;github.com/cilium/ebpf&quot; &quot;github.com/urfave/cli/v2&quot; &quot;spacelaser.net/zpr/pkg/snet/cfg&quot; ) 
 The error I get is &quot;could not import github.com/cilium/ebpf (no package for import github.com/cilium/ebpf&quot;. I have the variable lsp-go-library-directories-include-go-modules set to t and the directory $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/cilium/ebpf@v0.7.0 exists and has the correct code in it. What am I missing to make LSP pick up these libraries?

                    <span>José Calderón is interviewed by Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra . José has been working on functional programming at Galois and University of Maryland. He tells us about his research background in many different continents, his experience with teaching compilers, the relation between music and functional programming and the “Recursive Programming Techniques” book that in the 1970s captured the essence of functional programming.

                    <span>Running the following with stack script --resolver&#x3D;ghc-9.0.1 works, but running with stack script --resolver&#x3D;ghc-9.2.1 results in a stack overflow. Oddly, it works on ghc-9.2.1 compiling with -O2 but hangs when compiling with -O0.
 This behavior is surprising to me because, to my understanding, UndecidableSuperClasses carries the risk of infinite loops when type-checking, but at compile-time, it should concretize m and FooM m and the constraints should be erased. Is this not what happens? And did anything change in GHC 9.2 regarding UndecidableSuperClasses?
 I&#x27;ve also dumped out -ddump-tc for both -O2 and -O0, but I don&#x27;t see any meaningful differences.
 Repro:
 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableSuperClasses #-} import Data.Kind (Type) class (Monad m, MonadFoo (FooM m)) &#x3D;&gt; MonadFoo m where type FooM m :: Type -&gt; Type runFoo :: FooM m a -&gt; m a newtype MyMonad m a &#x3D; MyMonad { runMyMonad :: m a } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) instance Monad m &#x3D;&gt; MonadFoo (MyMonad m) where type FooM (MyMonad m) &#x3D; MyMonad m runFoo &#x3D; id main :: IO () main &#x3D; runMyMonad foo foo :: MonadFoo m &#x3D;&gt; m () foo &#x3D; runFoo $ return () 
 Update: It seems reproducible with even main &#x3D; runMyMonad $ runFoo $ return ()

                    <span>I can&#x27;t figure this out...
 I use a basic org-capture template:
 (setq 
 org-capture-templates
 \(&#x60;
 (&quot;t&quot; &quot;Task&quot; entry (file &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/tasks.org&quot;)
 &quot;* TODO %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i&quot; :empty-lines 1)
 (&quot;i&quot; &quot;Idea&quot; entry (file &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/ideas.org&quot;)
 &quot;* IDEA %?\n\n %U\n %a\n %i&quot; :empty-lines 1)
 (&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal&quot; entry (file+datetree &quot;~/.config/emacs/journal/journal.org&quot;)
 &quot;* %?\n %i\n&quot;)
 )
 )
 When I start the capture and select &#x27;j&#x27; to create a Journal entry, my first line has 7 stars. This causes the entry to start too far to the right and it looks weird. I can&#x27;t figure out why so many stars? Instead of 7, I expect maybe 4 stars:
 * Year
 ** Year-Month
 *** Year-Month-Day
 **** new journal entry goes here
 In an effort to learn elisp and try to fix the problem, I tried to modify org-datetree.el in the ~/.emacs/elpa/org-9.5.1 directory and recompile via emacs-lisp-recompile function after visiting the file. My modifications change the output (I removed tabs for example), but then it removes all of the dates! I don&#x27;t want to mess too much with the el file as my configuration is getting to a nice stable state.
 Any ideas why so many stars? Thanks in advance for looking at this!

                    <span>Is ther anyway to export existing anki cards to org-mode?
 I have found some github projects that deals with creating cards with org-mode, but not the other way arround.
 I eventually would like to convert notes (org files) to anki cards, but to be able to do that I first have to export my existing anki cards to org-mode.

I have nearly 4 years of experience, in those 4 years, I have 2 years of FP Scala experience. I&#x27;m a contractor, working fully remote, and currently getting 300EUR per day.

                    <span>Hi! This is my first time posting on this subreddit. 
 I am currently an intern at a bank that&#x27;s using Java and Spring for almost all of its backend services. My mentor tasked me to explore the basics of Scala for backend services so I&#x27;m here to ask for recommendations how one would build backend services as I&#x27;ve read around Scala doesn&#x27;t depend as much on frameworks as Java does. 
 I&#x27;ve read on some &#x27;frameworks&#x27; for Scala such as Play and Http4s, but the resources on those are quite scarce, and I&#x27;ve tried Http4s but I can&#x27;t get my head to wrap around dependency management using sbt.
 Are there any recommendations you would give me for learning?
 Thank you for your help!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to construct a 3 column dataframe where each column is an existing ListBuffer I have: var list1&#x3D; new ListBuffer[Int]() var list2&#x3D; new ListBuffer[String]() var list3&#x3D; new ListBuffer[String]() Next I run some ‏‏‎ logic to append items to each of the lists, so let&#x27;s assume they&#x27;re populated and all of equal length. Then I do: var new_df &#x3D; list1.toDF(&quot;list1_column&quot;) and I was thinking I could just use withColumn to add the other 2 lists as additional columns, one by one. But it&#x27;s saying: &quot;Type mismatch: expected Column. actual: ListBuffer[String]&quot; What should I do? Thanks so much! Have a great day!

                    <span>Is there a convention for user defined keybinding prefix? Based on this elisp manual I thought C-c was supposed to be that. While those are safe in lisp-mode, they are not in other major modes (org-mode, python-mode, go-mode...) that override the keybinds.
 Where do you map all your extra commands to so you don&#x27;t constantly fight with major-modes?
 EDIT: People pointed out that C-c LETTER is being saved for the user, which I misunderstood as it included other symbols as well. Thanks everyone.

                    <span>When I create a link in Org-Mode, I can click the link and go to the destination headline, which is great. Is there also a way to:
  
Also create a link *back* to the item I linked from?
 Do a search on a headline for all items that link to it?
  
Thanks!

                    <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m getting a new dev vm set up at a new job that requires jumping through some socks-proxy shaped hoops. So far, everything seems to be working either via the https_proxy env, ProxyCommand for git/ssh, or manually setting the proxy in Firefox. However, Emacs, when talking to any of the package repos, be they melpa, elpa, or gnu, always immediately errors with &quot;incomprehensible buffer&quot;. I haven&#x27;t found anything that makes any difference. I&#x27;d love to hear any ideas y&#x27;all have. TIA!

                    <span>I have been a happy Gnus user for years. Recently, though, it was persuasively brought to my attention that threads are fundamental to how emails work, so I have introduced some redundancy to my system in order to make the threads work. Now I find myself conflicted about how to resolve these three constraints:
  
Make &quot;sent&quot; messages visible anywhere, as sometimes I use a different computer at a different location. For this, I&#x27;ve made an email account which has the sole purpose of receiving BCC of all emails I send, and so I subscribe to this SENT inbox to get those messages.
 
I use the GCC field to store a local version of my email upon sending, which has the advantage of storing the BCC recipients that are omitted from my SENT emails (especially useful when I send an &quot;undisclosed recipients&quot; email).
 
I wish to see things in both my Sent folder and in-thread in my usual inbox location. This is working except that I end up with duplicates of message I&#x27;ve sent. I expect one in my sent folder and another in my inbox, but I am receiving two in my inbox, and (gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates t) doesn&#x27;t seem to make any noticeable difference, even though one of the messages I end up with in my inbox states &quot;this is a duplicate&quot;.
 Any improvements or alternatives that meet the needs of synchronizing mail across machines, maintaining a &quot;sent&quot; box, and allowing email threading in my inbox?

                    <span>I am working with lsp and company and found a very annoying feature that i would like to disable, when there is only one thing that can be suggested it is displayed like the image below, basically the word or symbol is &quot;auto completed&quot; on its own if i press tab if it is only a single suggestion. The problem is when i type too fast, for some reason this auto complete lags behind and actually affects the characters i input. So if i start typing sudo like below, if i am fast enough it will end up ignoring some of my input characters and i end up with suo or sdo sometimes. This placeholder is nice, to see but i dont want it to affect my actual keyboard input because it is slower than my type speed.

 EDIT: The issue did not seem to be related to the tooltip, nonetheless the answers below offer a perfectly good solution to replacing the tooltip with either nothing or the default company auto complete box (with only one suggestion). The problem was for some reason related to only typing the character &quot;t&quot; (for some reason) and the binding to (tab) i used to trigger auto complete in addition to enter (). 
 (define-key company-active-map (kbd &quot;tab&quot;) #&#x27;company-complete-selection) 
 This above was causing the character &quot;t&quot;, when typed in the buffer while company was filtering, to somehow lose focus from the buffer and stop typing in it.
 (define-key company-active-map [tab] #&#x27;company-complete-selection) 
 This however works fine, and tab also does what it is supposed to be doing - completing the marked suggestion.

A bunch of the compilation errors refer to the same structs/data types so I grabbed a sample of one of each (but maybe I missed one &quot;type&quot;):

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure why but suddenly when I open projects with projectile it is also including the millions of files inside the .git dir within the project. This clutters up the list of the actual files I want to work on. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what change I made to cause this (it was not a change with my emacs config, but I have been messing around with my git config recently). Is there a way to get projectile to ignore .git dirs recursively, and globally?

                    <span>Hey all, my question relates to what is the best approach to add some customization in a package&#x27;s implementation. For example, the code block below I have added some lines to the initial implementation but, I am not sure, wether this is practical since some updates later will ament the code added in the file. 
 I hope I am clear, but to add some clarification, while I am adding/editing the code in the package&#x27;s implementation found in the installation, would there be a more efficient way to call this instead of editing the file here. 
 Example below -commented lines are the ones I have added in the original file- after updating the package they will be lost
 (defun sclang-switch-to-workspace () (interactive) (let ((buffer (get-buffer sclang-workspace-buffer))) (unless buffer (setq buffer (get-buffer-create sclang-workspace-buffer)) (with-current-buffer buffer (sclang-mode) (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent map sclang-mode-map) (sclang-fill-workspace-mode-map map) (use-local-map map)) (let ((line (concat &quot;// &quot; (make-string 69 ?&#x3D;) &quot;\n&quot;))) (insert line) (insert &quot;// SuperCollider Workspace \n&quot;) ;; (insert &quot;// &quot; (current-time-string) &quot;\n&quot;) ;; (insert &quot;// Ready to do thy Biding Master &quot; (user-login-name) &quot;\n&quot;) ;; (insert line) (insert &quot;// using HTML Help: C-c C-h as usual, then switch to w3m buffer\n&quot;) (insert &quot;// and do M-x sclang-minor-mode in order te enable sclang code execution\n&quot;) (insert line) (insert &quot;\n&quot;)) (set-buffer-modified-p nil) cwd to sclang-runtime-directory (if (and sclang-runtime-directory (file-directory-p sclang-runtime-directory)) (setq default-directory sclang-runtime-directory)))) (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

                    <span>Forgive the title, but I&#x27;m going crazy here. I have spent 14 hours trying to get this to work and no luck.
 The issue is back-links won&#x27;t show up in my org-roam buffer.
 This is my config:
 (require &#x27;package) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;http://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) t) (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;org&quot; . &quot;https://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) t) (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename &quot;~/org-roam&quot;)) (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) (require &#x27;org-roam) (org-roam-setup) 
 I have installed org-roam, and org-roam--sqlite-available-p is set to t.
 I created the nodes with org-roam-node-insert and can follow the links just fine with org-open-at-point.
 You can see my org-roam folder here (and my config file is in there too).
 https://github.com/thread314/org-roam-troubleshoot
 I&#x27;ve deleted my .emacs.d folder and run emacs -Q, same result. I&#x27;ve even tried it on a completely fresh virtual machine, backlinks still won&#x27;t show up.
 I am running Emacs 27.2, Org 9.4.4 and Org-Roam 2.1.0.
 I have tried asking for help on the org-roam discourse and on the org-roam slack, no luck with either.
 I must be doing something wrong, but I just can&#x27;t figure out what. Can anyone help?
 I&#x27;d be happy to make a donation of $200 AUD to a charity of your choosing if you can help me with this (if that helps sweeten the pot).

 massive refactoring of interactive functions to improve discoverability
  
​
 The release was done due to the refactor to rename the public interactive functions . So we can build on top of something more sane :)
 ​
 Very thankful for Steven Allen for supporting this work through Patreon and special thank you to Derek Rachul for all the help to debug GitHub Enterprise 3.0 issues. There are so much yet to do!

                    <span>Given a set of coins and an amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.
 Note: a coin with a unit value is always assumed to exist in the given set of coins.
 Examples:
  
 Coins Amount min. no. of coins 
  
 {1,5,10,25} 1 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 4 4 
  {1,5,10,25} 5 1 
  {1,5,10,25} 6 2 
  {1,5,10,21,25} 63 3 
 
  
Say we are given a set of coins Cs &#x3D; {1,5,10,21,25} and we want to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up 63, then the algorithm below essentially translates to the following:
  answer &#x3D; min_coins(Cs, 63) &#x3D; minimum ( min_coins(Cs, 62) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 58) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 53) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 42) + 1, min_coins(Cs, 38) + 1 ) 
 A direct haskell implementation of the above strategy is:
 haskell minCoinsV1 :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Int minCoinsV1 _ 0…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to use MonadUnliftIO in my monad transformer stack while serving a Servant API. For example:
 haskell newtype AppM a &#x3D; AppM { runAppM :: Handler } deriving ( Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadIO, MonadUnliftIO -- This fails to compile ) 
 The problem is that Handler cannot derive MonadUnliftIO as it&#x27;s a newtype over ExceptT ServerError IO a, which does not have an instance for it.
 In order to get derive an instance, here&#x27;s a possible solution: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-} {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
 module Lib where
 import Control.Exception (try) import Control.Monad.Except (ExceptT (ExceptT)) import Control.Monad.IO.Class (MonadIO (liftIO)) import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp (run) import Servant (EmptyAPI (EmptyAPI), Handler…</span>

                    <span>I followed through the book (available for free on wikibooks) a while back. Aside from the lack of usage of modules, and Control.Monad.Error being deprecated, and the lack of unit testing, is there any other notable difference between the code in the book and modern idiomatic Haskell?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been going through the University of Finland MOOC course on haskell, and this example popped up:
 ​
 someLetters :: Gen String someLetters &#x3D; do c  sample someLetters &quot;yyyyyyyy&quot; &quot;zzzzzzzzz&quot; &quot;xxxxxxxxx&quot; &quot;yyyyyyy&quot; &quot;yyy&quot; &quot;ww&quot; &quot;xxxxxx&quot; &quot;yyy&quot; &quot;yyyyyyy&quot; &quot;xxxxxxxxxx&quot; &quot;y&quot; 
 My question is how is this &#x27;someletters&#x27; fn a pure fn? It will always return a List of strings, but the strings will always be different. If it was modified to pass in a starting string, it would still produce a list of random length strings, so the even if the parameter is the same, the results will be different almost all of the time.
 Or is it not a pure fn, and is it then fairly easy to write non-pure functions in Haskell?
 TIA

 When I tangle, I want this output:
 - foo: - spam - eggs - bacon: - spam - spam - baked beans 
 But what I get is this; the second block is dedented, which produces broken output:
 - foo: - spam - eggs - bacon: - spam - spam - baked beans 
 Is there some way to get Org to preserve whitespace in source blocks?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I am looking to solve the following problem. I am using org-agenda to view items marked as TODO. This presents a list. The list is long and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to scan. Ideally, I would like to have an interface where only the first item would load, I would hit &quot;n&quot; and then the next and the next and so on until there are no items left.
 Is this possible to do? What are the steps to take to achieve this?
 Thanks very much!
 I am running Spacemacs (0.200.13@27.2)

I have switched to a new job, now in my previous role I was working as a data engineer (scala and spark) and in the new role they want to put me in a team which deals with data processing (scala, spark, Kafka, akka streams, samza) but there is another team which deals with rest api development (scala, akka http, grpc, cats). I can choose where I want to be but this is where I am not able to make a decision. They have also told me that in future if I feel like the type of work I am doing is not for me then I can ask for change. Just want your inputs.

So I changed it to &#x60;shell-command-to-string &quot;chatty&quot;&#x60; and it gives me an output of &#x60;/bin/sh: line 1: chatty: command not found&#x60; but running &#x60;chatty&#x60; in my terminal launches the app just fine. 
 ​
 Is there something I can run that would launch programs on my system?

                    <span>So my emacs config is taking about ~20 sec to load which is really slow compared to the slowest load speed which I heard was around 5-7 sec? Just the previous day it loaded at about 4 sec. I haven&#x27;t really changed anything in my config since yesterday. What may have been the problem?

                    <span>Hi there! :)
 I wanted to share a package that I have developed. This package makes it possible to run, and interact, with shell commands that are run completely detached from Emacs. The name of the package comes from dtach, which is the program that makes this package possible. 
 As a user you start shell commands in dedicated sessions using dtache. Here is a list of some of the features that these sessions offer:
 - The user have access to all of the output from a session
 - The user gets a notification when a session has finished
 - Sessions are automatically labeled success or failure
 - Sessions can be started on remote hosts
 - The user can easily rerun a session
 - Sessions can be opened in a compile mode, which effectively makes it mimics M-x compile
 For a more thorough walk through of the package, and how to use it, you can watch this video which I have created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;if1W58SrClk
 And the package itself you can find at https://gitlab.com/niklaseklund/dtache

                    <span>Hej fellow &#x27;macsers, and in particular, hej fellow hyperbole users,
 I recently started using Hyperbole as a knowledge base and must say I am quite satisfied. I have in as an org extension so I get the benefit of being able to hide/show contents while retaining the functionality of hyperbole/hyrolo (I believe, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).
 However, there&#x27;s one thing that really annoys me, and I would like to know how to change that. Whenever I come out of a hyrolo-fgrep query, my hyrolo file is in read-only mode. Which means that I have to change out of it every time I made an edit. I C-s&#x27;ed through the Hyperbole manual but couldn&#x27;t find it mentioned anywhere.
 Since I am not yet very proficient with the inner workings of my kitchen-si *ahem* batteries-included computing environment I don&#x27;t even have a good idea on how to debug it. Thus, any more or less general considerations are also warmly welcomed!
 Have a good day, fellows :)

                    <span>I feel like it is something stupid that I&#x27;m doing, but I just cannot figure it out on my own. I created a simple project with cabal and it created basic project structure. I added another module that I called Work.hs into the same app folder that the Main.hs is at. VS Code doesn&#x27;t show any errors but when I run it with ghcid I get this error:
 app/Main.hs:5:1: error: Could not find module ‘Work’ Use -v (or &#x60;:set -v&#x60; in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 5 | import Work 
 Thank you!

                    <span>Hi, I am very new to haskell and recently I decided to read a book called Linear algebra 
 [Theory , Intuition, Code]. This book uses python+MATLAB as it&#x27;s language but I don&#x27;t like python that much and I don&#x27;t know matlab so I have been wondering are there any libraries that cover the linearalgebra funcitonality of numpy?

                    <span>I am doing a job search for a new position and thought now would be the perfect time to switch languages (currently done just OOP stuff)
 However I don&#x27;t have much Haskell knowledge (done learn you a Haskell and working on Haskell from first principals) Every job seems to require several years of experience with Haskell
 Are there jobs that are more like work studies or internships for learning Haskell? Where I can restart as a complete beginner to get experience?

                    <span>Do you use images in your notes regularly? 
 If so, what are your practices, tips, and tricks?
 ​
 The manual on images seems to be very basic. 
 ​
 I use the org-download package by abo-abo (https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download) to drop images into a note. 
 ​
 Should I always prepare them beforehand to have a consistent look (e.g. to have the same width through all the notes)?

 I thought this might be interesting for you all.
 Generate an HTML version of your agenda and then make it a default landing page in your browser. Result: every time you create a new tab you get a peek at your updated agenda. 
 Keeps me slightly more organized.
 Here&#x27;s the repo (not in Melpa): https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/agenda-html
 I run it like so (in my config):
  (add-hook &#x27;org-after-todo-state-change-hook (lambda () (run-with-idle-timer 20 nil (lambda () (load-file &quot;/Users/trae/workspace/github/agenda-html/agenda-html.el&quot;)))))  and here&#x27;s is what my new tab looks like:

                    <span>Twice a year — in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Preparation
Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we
weren’t able to decide whether the hackathon would happen at all until

                    <span>Is there an equivalent of cl&#x27;s format specifiers in emacs lisp?
 I haven&#x27;t found anything like &#x60;cl-format&#x60; in &#x60;cl-lib&#x60;?
 Is this just not implemented or is it planned to be done at some point?

                    <span>Hey, I&#x27;m trying to make counsel-fzf work on my windows setup and I can&#x27;t seem to manage. I&#x27;ve downloaded the fzf.exe binary and placed it in c:/emacs/bin and made that path available for emacs (both in exec-path and in the &quot;PATH&quot; variable). The command doesn&#x27;t do anything. It seems that it creates the process but there is no autocompletion list.
 Also, maybe related, when trying to run fzf from the *shell* it doesn&#x27;t provide the autocomplete list, even though it does so in windows cmd.
 Any toughts?

                    <span>For a while I&#x27;ve been lurking on the development of cell-mode [1], an Emacs mode created by David O&#x27;Toole. The blurb says:
  
Cell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacs’ included object system, EIEIO.
  
I decided to create this post because I am not sure how widely known this mode is, and I&#x27;d like to raise attention to it. Personally, I think it is an amazing idea - a magit or org-mode-like &quot;killer app&quot; for Emacs. It may sound like I&#x27;m exaggerating (and perhaps I am), but just off the top of my head I can think of a few really interesting use cases:
  
integrate it with org-mode as a table editor. You could edit the table in cell-mode and then see the ascii representation.
 integrate it with modes such as SQL mode and the like, so that you could visualise the table output as a cell-mode spreadsheet.
 as just a plain old spreadsheet. Most of my use cases for excel would probably go away with it plus Emacs lisp.
 easy CSV (etc) editing.
 derived modes (see mosaic [2] by the same author).
  
I&#x27;m sure many more use cases would quickly emerge by integrating it with other modes. If you use cell-mode or know of similar modes in this space do let me know on the comments.
 Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with David O&#x27;Toole or cell-mode development, just a regular Emacs user.

 The interesting part is seeing a representation of a latex equation as I&#x27;m typing them. Toggling the preview on and off is good in itself, but the live preview looks really, really nice. Is there a neat way to do this? I&#x27;m mostly interested in seeing equation live.

                    <span>I constantly open new emacs Frames and reposition relative to other applications (Ik, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not fully emacs yet), and found that manually repositioning the windows was a pain. Here&#x27;s a script and some keybindings I made to make that easier. These functions can also be called at startup to change how you want the initial emacs screen size to be.
 Explanation: It&#x27;s pretty simple, these functions just set the frame position, and size as portions of your initial starting screen size. 
 Hopefully, this helps someone, and any suggestions for improving code readability would be appreciated!

                    <span>One of my favorite parts of Org-mode is the customizable colored headers; personally, it makes me extremely motivated to work and makes Org-mode so much more beautiful. Here&#x27;s a quick script I made to make changing those colors easier, and hopefully, someone finds this helpful!
 ​
  
First, generate a palette you like from this color palette generator: https://coolors.co
 Copy the RGB color codes, separated by hyphens, from the url
 Paste it into the list in the same format as I have in the below code snippet
 Copy the code into your init file somewhere
  
Essentially, the code splits the string into a list of codes, then the face attributes set the org header colors to the corresponding list colors.
 I&#x27;d like to turn this into a package one day, but that&#x27;s a project for another time (or if someone wants to help me, I&#x27;d love to work with them). And finally, if anyone uses this, drop your color palettes below!
 ​
  (defun col-strip (col-str) (butlast (split-string (mapconcat (lambda (x) (concat &quot;#&quot; x &quot; &quot;)) (split-string col-str &quot;-&quot;) &quot;&quot;) &quot; &quot;))) (setq color-schemes (list (col-strip &quot;a21d1d-5497de-8e35b7-ffff5b-56cb7d-df5252-707efa&quot;) ; red blue purple study (col-strip &quot;2278bf-e15554-3bb273-507c6d-6e5775-598d91-7768ae&quot;) ; blue red green okay )) (setq pick-color 0) (setq color-theme (nth pick-color color-schemes)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-1 nil :height 1.3 :foreground (nth 0 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-2 nil :height 1.2 :foreground (nth 1 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-3 nil :height 1.1 :foreground (nth 2 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-4 nil :height 1.05 :foreground (nth 3 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-5 nil :foreground (nth 4 color-theme)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;org-level-6 nil :foreground (nth 5 color-theme))

                    <span>So, I started using Emacs yesterday, and it has been amazing! I am using the Doom Emacs distribution. I decided I am going to integrate Emacs in almost every part of my life, so I decided to switch to ORG mode from libreoffice. The switch wasn&#x27;t that easy but I did it. But now I need to know how to resize an image in Emacs, because sometimes I need to add images to my notes and documents. Thank you in advance

                    <span>Firstly doom emacs is great and God bless hlissner. But there&#x27;s one issue I&#x27;ve not yet been able to solve. 
 In doom emacs when the cursor is on a string, it highlights the entire string. But this really slows the app down and makes the editing process really annoying in the case of long strings. 
 Example
 In the above link, I am trying to edit a graphql schema which is a multi line string. And the entire string being highlighted every moment makes it really laggy and nearly impossible to edit. 
 So my question is how do I turn of this string highlighting feature in doom emacs? Thanks
 PS: I have googled for this but I couldn&#x27;t find te solution to this exact problem. Most of the solutions were to disable the hl-line mode which I don&#x27;t have a problem with.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got all ESS packages installed via MELPA, I can enter R mode and run R commands, everything seems OK, except TAB completion for objects or parameters simply does not work (although it does perform indenting correction, which is one of the TAB features if a completion not detected). I have latest Emacs installed on Ubuntu 21.10, fresh install, no customization. Isn&#x27;t the latest ESS just supposed to work without any extra packages or configs? Is this a bug? Has the TAB completion been replaced by another command?

                    <span>I was reading a discussion about keyboards and decided that maybe this is something that would benefit others.
 I have been pressing Ctrl with my palm for years (just below left pinky). It only works with external keyboards, and it does not work very well for all Ctrl combinations (e.g. Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-X is at the limit of doable, in that case I use the right ctrl).
 but it has saved my pinky from being overworked
 (and yes, I tried dvorak, but I could not get used to emacs ctrl sequences no matter how much I tried... i was able to get to around 40-50 words a minute for text, but like 1 emacs command per minute --after 59 wrong commands).
 Aside from mapping CAPS lock to Ctrl, are there any other tricks people use with the typical keyboard?
 Edit: somebody mentioned that this is probably useful only for small sizes of hands. When fully extended my hands are 21cm from tip of thumb to tip of pinky.

                    <span>According to Transient documentation:
 &quot;The command can also be a closure or lambda expression, but that should only be used for dynamic transients whose suffixes are defined when the prefix command is invoked. See information about the :setup-children function&quot;
 So according to that I tried the following:
 (defun set-children (children) &#x27;((1 transient-suffix (:key &quot;o&quot; :command normal-func)) ;; OK (1 transient-suffix (:key &quot;k&quot; :description (lambda () &quot;All ok&quot;) :command (lambda (message &quot;hey&quot;)))))) (transient-define-prefix my-transient () [&quot;Description&quot; :setup-children set-children]) 
 I&#x27;m getting (wrong-type-argument (command symbol) (lambda nil &quot;hey&quot;))
 So it seems that it only accepts symbols
 Any ideas? thanks in advance

                    <span>I&#x27;ve often heard emacs described as a plaform to build editors, but aside from evil mode, I don&#x27;t know of any other radical rebuilds of the editing experience. While I like emacs, the keybindings are brutal to my old worn tendons. I know I can change them, but I lack the wherewithal to undertake a radical rebuild. I&#x27;m perfectly comfortable with vi but prefer something that&#x27;s not modal. Are there any other total redesigns of keybindings or editing I should look at?

                    <span>Hey! I&#x27;m trying to move stuff over to Emacs and off the web so my computer experience would be more smooth and centralized. I have an rss feed set up which I can attach to youtube subscriptions, but I&#x27;m at a total loss on how to play videos in VLC or something else from Emacs. I&#x27;ve tried the vlc package from melpa, I&#x27;ve fiddled around with the vlc.el file for hours, followed tutorials, and I got nothing to work right. Does anyone have any advice? If it&#x27;s relevant, I&#x27;m on Windows 10.

                    <span>I am seeking someone to partner with who can teach Haskell to absolute beginners. And when I say beginners - I mean zero programming experience. 
 This would be an online class - taught for 2 hours per day. Time of day and length of course to be determined. 
 This person will need to develop the class material without references to other programming languages or concepts. 
 Message me to discuss.
 Edit: 1. Time zone is one of the 4 US mainland time zones 2. Assumed knowledge would be high school and fluent English 3. Targeted toward Cardano smart contracts 4. Using whatever device they own (if there are device requirements that can be communicated to students prior to sign up) 5. Moneys is to be determined based off of length of class and number of students.

                    <span>Wanted to know if there&#x27;s been work around this yet: with eslint, you can extend a base config pulled in via npm and add on your application&#x27;s specific customizations. This centralizes the config in 1 place for all apps. Wanting to do the same with our Haskell linter, so hoping that hlint could do that. I don&#x27;t see that nor can I find examples of it. Does anyone know if that exists?

                    <span>I have a project that (on @paf31&#x27;s advice, if I recall correctly) I had divided into a number of subprojects. I always run it in GHCI, and when I was using Stack I&#x27;m pretty sure I could rebuild incrementally. But then it stopped building in Stack, so I switched to Cabal, which only lets me rebuild incrementally for one subproject at a time -- if I make changes to another subproject, I have to quit and rerun cabal ghci. So suddenly compilation was taking a long time.
 I ducked the problem by just making it a monorepo again. But it made me wonder -- how hard would it be to make compiled code content-addressed, like Unison does?

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rg7kmp/how_to_build_a_list_comprehension_with_unknown/">

                    <span>List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. 
 For example,
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x &lt;- [0..2] and y &lt;- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. 
 One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:
  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.
 The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables&#x27; references in a generator&#x27;s body.
 For example, 
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10*x..10*x+2]] 
 We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.
 Question:
 Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables&#x27; references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?
 Thanks
  
Edit:
 Some one possibly misunderstand my question.
 For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [[x1] | x1 &lt;- [0..2]]
 [[x1,x2] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 &lt;- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]
 -- and so on &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way. It would be nice if code can be seen as data (e.g. List).

                    <span>I&#x27;m hiring Haskell developers again, for the Core Strats team of Modeling and Analytics. The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer&#x27;s Workshop last month where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;A70SN7vFsKU
 ​
 Applications must go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;128083
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100029752
 ​
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the London one is only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (PL or UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period (where circumstances allow). We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won&#x27;t be able to see your application until you pass this assessment.

 Cutting to the chase: I have a cabal project for Advent of Code, and would like to profile it. I am familiar with profiling single *.hs files, but I would like to be able to profile the entire project.
 What is the recommended best practice for doing this with cabal? I tried google, but it appears as though my googlefu need some work. My cabal file, as well as the rest of the project can be found here.
 If any more information is needed, please do let me know!

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m currently writing up my PhD thesis using org-mode, and it is a joy in comparison to my past experiences writing raw LaTeX. 
 I&#x27;m simultaneously attempting to write up some of the thesis chapters in paper form for publication, and have been creating the papers by selectively #+INCLUDE -ing the thesis chapter .org files. I very much dislike the idea of maintaining the same text in multiple files (fix a typo or re-word something in one, will I remember to propagate those changes throughout?), however the text required for the papers needs to be somewhat more concise than what appears in the thesis. So far I have handled this by having org files containing the core text for a section, which appears in both the thesis and the paper, and another org file that expands on the core and appears in the thesis only. 
 This approach works well enough, but falls down when I want to interleave concise text and extended text. I could use the line number option for the include command to achieve this, however the text is changing too often for this to be practical. The natural conclusion seems to be to break things down even further, and to have separate org files per paragraph of text, and to construct larger documents out of these. 
 Does anyone here have any experience of something like this (maybe there are packages which could help?), or perhaps better ideas (i.e. am I being a lunatic)?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hello! I am confused on how org-agenda-list is picking up an old file that doesn’t exist on my file system anymore, nor is it in org-agenda-files.
 The file it’s picking up is an old conflicted copy (by NextCloud sync) that I have since removed. It manages to show the old contents of that file so I assume it’s caches somewhere.
 Is my assumption correct? Is there a cache somewhere?
 I am using emacsclient and I have restarted it a couple of times with kill-emacs.
 What should I try next?

                    <span>Hello. I am starting learning Scala (coming from Python background) and I am having a lot of trouble simply testing my scripts. I can&#x27;t find very much in Google and StackOverflow is not the right place because my question is too open, and the subreddit r/learnscala seems to be dead. So is there any place where I can post my newbie question? Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to match generic implicit conversion with quotes. Minified example:
 case class Wrapper[T](i: T) given converter[T]: Conversion[Wrapper[T], T] with def apply(wrapper: Wrapper[T]) &#x3D; wrapper.i conversionParser { 1 + Wrapper(2) } 
 with
 // Want it to print &quot;Success&quot; def conversionParserImpl[T: Type](expr: Expr[T])(using Quotes): Expr[Unit] &#x3D; println(s&quot;Matching ${expr.show}&quot;) expr match case &#x27;{($a: Int) + ($b: Int)} &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Addition&quot;) conversionParserImpl(a) conversionParserImpl(b) case &#x27;{$a: Int} if a.value.isDefined &#x3D;&gt; println(s&quot;Literal: ${a.valueOrAbort}&quot;) case &#x27;{converter.apply($a)} &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Success&quot;) case _ &#x3D;&gt; println(&quot;Not matched&quot;) &#x27;{()} inline def conversionParser[T](inline expr: T) &#x3D; ${ conversionParserImpl(&#x27;expr) 
 But output is:
 Matching 1.+(Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2))) Addition Matching 1 Literal: 1 Matching Main$package.converter[scala.Int].apply(Wrapper.apply[scala.Int](2)) Not matched 
 If the converter is changed from generic to concrete Int, then the quoted code matches without any changes to the macro. Tried case &#x27;{converter[Int].apply($a)} in the generic case, doesn&#x27;t fix it.
 Thanks in advance for your help :)

My head is all over the place, yet I really don&#x27;t get the main idea behind implicit. When do we need to use it, why do you use it, etc. if someone can explain to me as simple as possible, I would really appreciate!

                    <span>Hi All,
 I have been working in scala but only for writing spark jobs. Now from past few months, I have started learning FP in scala. I want to get into more depth. Any suggestions are welcome on how do I plan myself for it.
 Also, taking a Math course, will it benefit. If yes, please let me know any online courses for Maths. ( Ofcourse, FP is the hardest thing, but I want to get into it, slowly )
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

 Currently when i want to reference webpage in note (org-mode) i simply put url as link, but this method is not future proof. (website/company can die, url change, etc)
 How do you save / archive web pages?
 Do you use bookmarking tools like wallabag, shiori, etc?
 Or do you simply save webpage as pdf, epub etc?

                    <span>Hello, I have prettier set to show errors when the format isn&#x27;t correct. But in Emacs it shows an additional (formatting?) string. I don&#x27;t know where I should report this to. In vscode and the terminal it shows just the Delete &#x27;;&#x27; part. Is this an ESlint or LSP error?

 I hope this makes sense
  
EDIT. In the meanwhile I removed eslint-plugin-prettier and installed prettier.el. I don&#x27;t really need linting hints showing up as errors as it gets fixed on save, so this is great

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to play around with semantic highlighting in lsp, and what i was trying to do is properly highlight usages of a function&#x27;s argument/parameter within a given scope (say, code block, function etc.), and not only at the declaration point. It seems that lsp does understand scopes, looking through the source i found out that faces such as lsp-face-highlight-write/read/textual - which do actually highlight the variable when i hover over it with the cursor. Now i am looking at doing the same but make it permanent, not only when you hover over the symbol. Trying to do that for both member variables and function argument variables. Lsp has lsp-face-semhl-member &amp; lsp-face-semhl-parameter which are only coloured at the point of declaration.
 In the example below, crude, but member variables are purple, while the ones passed as function arguments are underlined-pink. (The Styling is just a sample)

                    <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;ve been using ghcup to manage and install ghc, stack, and cabal on my mac. Now I tried installing ghc on windows with Chocolatey and Haskell Platform. It installs version 9.2.1 by default with &#x60;choco install haskell-dev&#x60;. I need version 8.10.7 installed since some packages that I&#x27;m using are not yet supported under 9.2.1. What&#x27;s the recommended way to install 8.10.7. Is ghcup a viable alternative? I tried it and it seems not to have &quot;tui&quot; available on Windows for some reason.
 Thank you!

                    <span>I am trying to upgrade GHC from 8.10.7 to 9.X.X. I am very new to Cabal/Stack/GHC, but wanting to get into Haskell development after really enjoying LINQ and F# as a full time C# engineer.
 ​
 I have brew (3.3.7), stack (2.7.3), and Cabal (3.6.2) installed, and I thought something as simple as &quot;cabal update&quot; or &quot;brew update&quot; or &quot;stack update&quot; would somehow magically work.
 ​
 For context, I am used to archlinux where arch documentation, a simple pacman -Syu or grabbing from the AUR solves 99.98% of my problems. But I am relatively new to apple hardware for development.
 Thanks a ton, and I apologize for the ignorance.

                    <span>Hey all! I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason, but I&#x27;ve also heard a lot of good things about Functional Programming, Simplified by Alvin Alexander. I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on either book, or if people would recommend one over the other or something like that. Any insight is appreciated!

                    <span>Greetings from Canada 🙂
I was using nvAlt and Simplenote together for about 10 years and recently migrated to my own app, Hyperdraft, which I consider a web remake of Notational Velocity; my app is not based on files, but it supports markdown and you can own your data.
I&#x27;m interested in the idea of &#x27;turning your text notes into a website&#x27; and have been cultivating a digital garden / personal wiki for about a year now, inspired by Andy Matuschak; in the same place as my private notes, I have other ones that are &#x27;public&#x27;, and they appear as pages on this website (wiki links become public URLs).
Learning about Zettelkasten over the last few years, it feels like I&#x27;ve been practicing it with todos and building projects, but not as much with &#x27;knowledge&#x27;—my notes about the work of others &#x27;slip away&#x27; because they are not interconnected and I don&#x27;t put them in my note taking app. (I&#x27;m looking for an app that approximates manual sorting of index cards).
The &#x27;searchable left-list&#x27; pattern is quite functional for me, and so I tend to incorporate it into all of my apps in some way. If you&#x27;re interested to know more, check out my presentation called Wetware of writing and doing, where I also go into how I use Hyperdraft to make things happen.
Hope to hang out here more often as I have more to learn about Zettelkasten and maybe some apps to make 😉.</span>

                    <span>Is there an app out there that imitates the original Zettelkasten&#x27;s spatial positioning (sequential ordering of index cards)? I would like to create one large universal stack of digital cards and sort them manually; I know that sounds tedious but it&#x27;s a hunch I&#x27;d like to explore.</span>

                    <span>I use emacs on various machines. I run the same init.el and set of packages everywhere, but different versions of emacs itself. In particular I want my setup to support a relatively old version of emacs (26.3) which I can find or easily install on random machines.
 As a result, I&#x27;d like to upgrade my packages but only when they are compatible with this maximum allowed version of emacs itself.
 I can hit &quot;U&quot; in the package list to mark all packages which can be upgraded up to my current emacs version. What I do now is manually inspect the upgrade list, checking the dependencies of each marked package, and removing items which require a too advanced version of emacs. But this is cumbersome.
 Is there a command or a programmatic way to restrict this list to show only the upgrades which are compatible with the maximum allowed emacs version? I can&#x27;t find any commands for this. I looked for package functions for querying a package&#x27;s dependencies by package name, but it seems like most of the functions in package.el need a package-desc as input, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get that struct only from a package name and for available rather than installed versions.

                    <span>Hi, I am trying to write a function for prettifying symbols on a per-mode basis. The idea is to accept the mode-hook and a list of substitutions, and then to create a hook and engage it with the mode-hook. The function looks like this:
  (defun +xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook (mode-hook symbol-list) (interactive) (add-hook mode-hook (lambda () (mapc (lambda (pair) (push pair prettify-symbols-alist)) symbol-list) (global-prettify-symbols-mode 1))) (message &quot;Hook set.&quot;)) 
 An example of the intended use would be:
 (+xx/prettify-symbols-set-hook &#x27;org-mode-hook &#x27;((&quot;#+BEGIN_SRC&quot; . ?») (&quot;#+begin_src&quot; . ?») (&quot;#+END_SRC&quot; . ?«) (&quot;#+end_src&quot; . ?«))) 
 I get no errors, but the hook does not seem to work. When I open new buffers of the given mode, the pretty-symbols do not appear. Any comments/suggestions would be very welcome as I am have very limited elisp experience.

 I wanted to decrease the start time in emacs and from what i read i have to activate daemon which i did but it created some kind of confusion for me! 
 Basically created a symlink with ln -s /etc/init.d/emacs /etc/init.d/emacs.myuser then activated in my run devel!
 What is happening when i am lunching emacs ? Am i lunching an emacs client ? is the emacs server the same thing as emacs client ?

 The class cue-group-start-offset contains the timestamps and cue style-scope ytd-transcript-body-renderer with attributes of role or tabindex is used for the transcript text.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a python setup with lsp, mspyls and company is used in the background for documentation completion (I think). For nearly all Numpy functions, company-show-doc-buffer returns an empty or sometimes wrong buffer. All other functions such as Scipy, built-ins or user-defined work perfectly well. Also, Code completion with company works fine for Numpy which is a bit weird.
 Has anyone encountered this as well? I read somewhere that Numpy added some decorators that might interfere with some APIs, but this also happens for old Numpy packages in a Python 3.5 environment.
 Please help :)

                    <span>Hej fellow parens haxx0rs,
 I am in the lengthy process of learning several lispy programming languages, one of them being guile scheme. I&#x27;ve installed the guile3 package using AUR on Manjaro successfully. Its binary resides in /usr/bin/guile3, and I am able to run it from the terminal no problem.
 For Scheme hacking, I want to use the Geiser package of which I heard only good stuff. I can use it with MIT Scheme and Guile-2.2.7, the implementation that is chosen when installed from official Manjaro repos. However, Geiser does not find guile3. When I try M-x geiser, it says &quot;Cannot find guile3 implementation&quot;.

 Currently, I have to download the package source code and untar it into stackproject/src and I can use those hidden module in my code.
  
Obviously, the obvious question is is there any simple way to import hidden module?

                    <span>Hello!
 I don&#x27;t understand how to get an index of locally available documentation and installed packages.
 I added the flag: &quot;Documentation: True&quot;, and indeed if I navigate to: &#x27;~/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/attoparsec-0.14.3-a88f9f2009aaf50ec4de28c96eaab575e97e192943bebbfec18a608dffd670fd/share/doc/html&#x27;, all the docs are there, and they even link back to the ghc documentation (in &#x27;file:///home/jurjen/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/share/doc/ghc-8.10.7/html/libraries&#x27;), which is great!
 But navigating or exploring to such funky directories is unwieldy and I cannot find a generated index and they are not linked into the standard index living in &#x27;ghcup/.../share/doc/ghc-8.10/html&#x27; which is annoying since that is my main source of information for installed packages.
 I tried to set the options 
  docdir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html/libraries/$libname htmldir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html haddockdir: $htmldir 
 But that didn&#x27;t seem to do nothing. Anyone know how to make a global index of all (user) installed packages with cabal?

                    <span>After learning Haskell for some time, I would say that grasping most libraries and using them to build applications is a doable task, what really puzzles me is how to cultivate the mindset to enable one to build complex libraries. Some examples would be servant (type-level concept), scotty (monad transformer concept), opaleye (profunctor concept), and a lot more. Many Haskell libraries use sophisticated techniques to achieve DSL, but we seem to lack learning materials (the design parts, not the practical usage parts) that are accessible to everyday programmers.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/purescript/comments/redlsh/how_to_get_the_contents_of_a_webfileblob_from_a/">

                    <span>This is probably a super basic beginner question, but I&#x27;m struggling a bit to figure it out. I&#x27;m trying to make a simple web app to learn frontend development, and wanted some functionality supporting dropping files into the app, but I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get the literal contents of the file dropped to send it over to Haskell. My Haskell server is set up with Servant, and the Purescript side with Payload, and I&#x27;m looking at the documentation for Web.File.File, but the types are all abstract, and I don&#x27;t see how to get the actual contents of the file. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s stored as a Blob, but there aren&#x27;t any functions for consuming blobs and Payload can&#x27;t transmit them.
 So I thought maybe I need to use the Javascript FFI, and was looking at this page, but I see there are quite a few different ways to consume the files, and I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, or what Purescript types they would translate to. I&#x27;m assuming the problem isn&#x27;t actually super complex, but I&#x27;m just not quite sure what to try, as I seem to spend the majority of my development time trying to debug issues with the Haskell/Purescript sides communicating with one another, so I&#x27;m hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction to avoid wasting any more.
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for something File -&gt; ByteString, so that the server can save/retrieve the file for later, without knowing the Purescript equivalent of ByteString.
 Alternatively, I mostly intend to have both the server and application running on the same machine, so if I can get the full filepath then I can just transmit that, and have the server read the file directly, but I can only seem to get the filename, and some googling seems to suggest the directory simply isn&#x27;t stored in a DragEvent.
 Is there any easy way to do what I&#x27;m trying?

 One of the top iPython features I miss when using the python inferior shell in Emacs is the ability to use multi-line commands. python-MLS fills this gap, providing seamless multi-line command editing right at the prompt, with easy copy and paste in or out, a buffer-like editing experience, indentation, optimized fontification, persistent command history, history navigation, and more.

 Is there a way to do this?
 Edit: /u/moriturius provided the answer to this: M-backspace
 Edit 2: And it turns out Ctrl-backspace works, too.

 The basic support for Bitbucket is moving slowly and can be tracked here. My time to work on it is very limited :/

                    <span>Hello all. I can link pdf in org mode by doing Ctrl-C Ctrl-l, this would show a prompt in the mini buffer and I can just choose &quot;file&quot; and select my pdf file. I can also write a description for it if I want. However, this would link to a complete PDF file, I would like to link to an exact page from that PDF. It doesnt need to be opened in emacs, I write stuff in org but I export as latex then as pdf; so the on Linux qpdfview takes care off that. Anyway, the command to insert the pdf file, if you expand it is:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf][some description]] 
 This would generate a some description and I can click on it (either inside emacs which opens the PDF with Docview or qpdfview if I export it org to pdf). I check this, https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html and tried to change the code to:
 [[file:/home/user/someplace/file.pdf::6][some description]] 
 so that it automatically opens to page 6 of the pdf. This does not seem to work.

                    <span>New package: https://github.com/FrostyX/eyebrowse-restore
 I am a big fan of the Eyebrowse package, it is a cornerstone of my Emacs usage.
 I have just one issue with it - under some circumstances, I lose all my window configurations when restarting Emacs. It really hurts, so I wrote a small package called eyebrowse-restore that automatically saves Eyebrowse window configurations for all your Emacs frames and allows you to use them again.

                    <span>Hi, I am looking for a way to override faces globally. For example force a face to inherit from another face all of its attributes. And want to avoid doing what i am doing below. What i do right now is something like the block below. But this is annoying. I looked into the Faces Wiki on Emacs found the remapping functionality - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Face-Remapping.html. But it works just for the current buffer as far as i know. I want to avoid hooks for buffer switches to use the remapping, and preferably have this in my config, execute once, override the faces and be done at that point.
 What I am trying to achieve is force a few packages, which use custom face attributes (i.e helm-rg) to use the default attributes of my theme (i.e make the helm-rg-preview-line-highlight face force inherit/override itself from my mode-line face styles etc.). I am using doom-one theme - https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes (on vanilla emacs, not doom)
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;dst nil ;; This is Just a sample, there are more attributes not specified here :underline &#x27;unspecified :slant &#x27;unspecified :weight &#x27;unspecified :height &#x27;unspecified :family &#x27;unspecified :foreground &#x27;unspecified :background &#x27;unspecified :inherit &#x27;src)

                    <span>I’ve sort of created an Emacs theme for my Nyxt instance. Also played with the Nyxt status-buffer a bit in order to be able to see every enabled mode in the current buffer.

                    <span>I tagged it as AoC since my question came up doing one of those problems but its more of a general question I&#x27;d say.... 
 So I learned about Advent of Code and wanted to use it to learn some more Haskell.
 I did the first day, which went well. However I struggle with the second one...
 In theory it shouldn&#x27;t be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:
  
Read the lines
 Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)
 Sum up all values
 ---
  
1.-2. were no problem.
 With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that 
 foldl (\ p c -&gt; p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf
 where testInputf is a list of Strings ([String]).
 For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that 
  Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] 
 And I can&#x27;t figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?
 For testing purposes Ive also tried using map 
 map (read . last) testInputf 
 which throws the same error and I can&#x27;t figure out why...
 Thank you very much!

                    <span>Hi, r/haskell,
 I am working on Chameleon, an experimental visual type debugging tool for Haskell. A couple of months ago I posted an advertisement for a user study for Chameleon. After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges. Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed https://sup.ercu.be. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 I am happy to answer any questions regarding Chameleon in this thread.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

                    <span>Edit:
 Based on the comments by u/p3tr4gon, u/psycotica0, I kind of understand how this partially applied type constructor works like.
 My little example use-case:
 type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v --says IntMap is a Map with an Int key and some type v Value --my toy example function to return an IntMap String intMap :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; IntMap String intMap num str &#x3D; Map.singleton num str --and from the original question this also worked someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList :: IntMap String --------------------------------------------------------------------- --ghci output below Prelude&gt; :r [1 of 1] Compiling Shapes ( ch8_types.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. *Shapes&gt; intMap 2 &quot;Noah&quot; fromList [(2,&quot;Noah&quot;)] *Shapes&gt; myIntMap fromList [(1,&quot;Noah&quot;),(2,&quot;Lisa&quot;),(3,&quot;Mary&quot;),(4,&quot;Sandra&quot;)] 
 And I agree that this is a toy example that probably does not have many use cases.
 Original question:
 In Learn You a Haskell 8.5, they have this example
 --partially apply type constructor type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v type IntMap&#x27; &#x3D; Map.Map Int 
 How would I use this? I only know how to make a so-called IntMap like this
 import qualified Data.Map as Map someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList --deleted due to typo please see edits above

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to get org-return to call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation (e.g. &#x27;[cite:@author1998]&#x27;). Digging a little I see that org-return will only call org-open-at-point if (org-return-follows-link is non-nil and) calling (org-element-context) would yield something of the form &quot;(link (:type...&quot;. Since calling (org-element-context) yields something like &quot;(citation-reference...&quot;, org-open-at-point is never called when point is on a citation and I call org-return. 
 So... any easy way to do this, short of redefining org-return? (Or better, perhaps, to write a wrapper that will call org-open-at-point when point is on a citation and call org-return otherwise?) It seems to me that it would be convenient to have citations treated much like file:// expressions, but maybe there&#x27;s a reason for not doing this?

                    <span>Left field question. I often copy text from GMail into an emacs buffer for saving. Some of the spaces get rendered as light blue underlines as, hopefully, shown in the image below. The text I&#x27;m cutting looks just like regular text. Any ideas whats going on? Or how I&#x27;d learn more about what emacs is rendering?
 BTW its an org-mode buffer

                    <span>So the title says it. Basically, I have a buffer full of babel code blocks that I don&#x27;t want to run when I first load the buffer in Emacs. I see org-babel-execute-buffer, but how do you make sure it&#x27;s off? I think the default behavior is already not auto-evaluating the blocks, isn&#x27;t it, so I don&#x27;t need to worry. So yes, how do you definitively control the org-babel-execute-buffer behavior on or off? It seems though, that an export to HTML etc. does try to run evaluate all blocks. How can that be turned off?

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve been trying for 2 days to get this to work. This is obviously not the right way. I get *invalid* in the mode-line and the CPU total usage is instead displayed in the minibuffer. Also it does create a *Shell Command Output* buffer. That buffer is not desired. 
 Im aware that I need setq-default but for the purpose of testing I use with only setq. I test in the scratch buffer. Before someone comes and ask why? And say &quot;Emacs is a text editor!&quot; I run EXWM and I need the CPU/MEM total usage to be displayed all the time. I&#x27;ve been looking for a package that would display these info rather in the mode-line or in the systray. I&#x27;ve found nothing :( However, I did find a package that does display these info in the minibuffer. The minibuffer is not the best place for this tho. Also that package was making my Emacs slow af. Dont ask for the name of the package, I dont recall. Plus, I dont want to hit on someone else work. I cant even write this function alone, so ya. 
 So if you want to help, please do and thank you :) Also, Im pretty sure this little function could be appreciated by other Emacs users. 
 Here&#x27;s what I came with so far for the CPU:
 (defun cpu-usage-3 () &quot;Display CPU Usage&quot; (shell-command &quot;ps -A -o pcpu | tail -n+2 | paste -sd+ | bc&quot;)) ;; Found that ps command line on the internet. I did not create that. (setq mode-line-format (list &#x27;(:eval (cpu-usage-3))))

How do I have the cursor at $2 be between the { }?
 yas-choose-value prompts to choose a value but I can&#x27;t use Tab to choose the second value. If I do, it disappears. I have to use the arrow key

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that the second release candidate for upcoming text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been just uploaded on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 What&#x27;s changed between rc1 and rc2?
 head.hackage has been updated to text-2.0, which helped to find and fix several bugs and regressions.
 What&#x27;s next?
 If no critical issues are identified in the next week or two, the final release of text-2.0 will follow shortly.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve started working on performance of the venerable but somewhat neglected pqueue package. The changes I&#x27;ve made so far are pretty obviously good, and make a big difference in even the most informal testing. But to make decisions about smaller points, I really need benchmarks, and the package has none. Does anyone know of a benchmark suite for priority queues? One that includes algorithms that involve persistent queue use would be particularly desirable, but I&#x27;ll take anything.

                    <span>I was musing about the following:
  
Would a language version*, where &#x27;in the case of a newtype everything (that&#x27;s derivable, including with language extensions, like GeneralizedNewTypeDeriving) is automatically derived, unless a manual derivation or a manual instance is defined (or manually suppressed, with a new syntax)&#x27; be more ergonomic?
  
I was thinking about this, because I noticed that with quick problems I was often reaching for type instead of newtype. The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.
  
*) I don&#x27;t pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.
  
Would this even be viable? Would there be undesirable consequences? Would it indeed improve ergonomics, or was that stray thought just a wrong impression?

                    <span>Hi haskellers. I was installing haskell on my distro, I saw a package called haskell-language-server. I searched a lot on internet, but I want an easy explaination of language-server and haskell-language-server in simple words. If you can also explain it layman&#x27;s term, it would be very helpful, hopefully. I appreciate your help.

                    <span>My situation: I offer lots of training. Around a training, several date-sensitive activities need to happen, that I would like to see in my agenda e.g.
  
a week before the training I need to order materials and exams
 the day before I need to set up the online whiteboard
 the day of the training, I need to conduct the training (and would like this to be reflected by a due date)
 one day after the training, I want to send a link to a feedback form
  
You get the gist.
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to set up a capture template so that I enter &quot;Training on subject X, on date Y&quot;, and org will automatically calculate the corresponding due dates for these surrounding activities and stick them into the newly captured structure.
 Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn Scala and need the docker plugin so that I can publish an image to my dockerhub repo. It&#x27;s very confusing to figure out how to do this, and there are so many steps involved. 
 I have created a simple hello-world app and running &#x60;sbt publishLocal&#x60; works fine. It seems like I need 2/3 different plugins for publishing to a remote repo? 
 If anyone has a simple example, it would be much appreciated! As long as I can run sbt publish from my terminal I&#x27;m happy
 Here is my code so far:
 ​
 build.sbt:
 scalaVersion :&#x3D; &quot;2.13.3&quot;
 name :&#x3D; &quot;hello-world&quot;
 organization :&#x3D; &quot;ch.epfl.scala&quot;
 version :&#x3D; &quot;1.0&quot;
 publishTo :&#x3D; Some(&quot;Hello-world app&quot; at &quot;&quot;)
 libraryDependencies +&#x3D; &quot;org.scala-lang.modules&quot; %% &quot;scala-parser-combinators&quot; % &quot;2.0.0&quot;
 ​
 plugins.sbt:
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.github.sbt&quot; % &quot;sbt-native-packager&quot; % &quot;1.9.4&quot;)
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;se.marcuslonnberg&quot; % &quot;sbt-docker&quot; % &quot;1.8.2&quot;)
 addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.eed3si9n&quot; % &quot;sbt-assembly&quot; % &quot;x.y.z&quot;)

                    <span>Slim pickings it seems, Proto Quill and Skunk, with JOOQ as the only stable offering (ironic that a Java library is the only one that is production ready to use with Scala 3).
 Ideally looking for something like Slick or Quill (i.e. composable type safe queries), but am probably going to be forced to go with JOOQ, which is as non-idiomatic Scala as it gets, or just ignore Scala 3 for another year and hope the landscape changes in the interim.
 Scala 3 adoption :\

                    <span>I love emacs as a text editor for programming. But I am trying to build a GTD system using emacs orgmode and calendar and the search lists and calendar displays on emacs always end up looking like a nightmarish wall of text that makes looking at them a pain, a bit too information-dense, making it hard to focus on things. My eyes just bounce around the screen without focusing on anything.
 Is there a way to build similar calendar and search screens on emacs that have instead a lot of white space and separation between items, and focusing in readability rather than on information density?
 I basically would like more structure and less text on screen.
 Some examples:
  
http://doc.norang.ca/block-agenda-nonproject.png
  
This is a task list, but it just presents line after the other of tasks with very little structure and forces you to read through everything to find things rather than having more structure and less crowded text.

Very crowded week-calenday-view with the tasks of one day just piling on top of the tasks of the next day and making it hard to get a clear, temporal view of the view.
 I haven&#x27;t been able to find any examples with more readable and less crowded views. Has anybody built anything like this? Or is emacs the wrong tool for this and maybe more centered for users that like to see a lot of information at once rather than more structured information? I realize it may be difficult to do what other task and calendar applications do with pure text, so I may be looking at the wrong tool.

                    <span>So I thought I might create a wrapper that uses advice to overwrite a function temporarily, re-routing it:
 (defun ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (&amp;rest body) (progn (advice-add &#x27;compose-mail :override #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail) (unwind-protect (progn body) (advice-remove &#x27;compose-mail #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail)))) 
 Turns out this doesn&#x27;t work when called via:
 (ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (compose-mail)) 
 What does work, though, is a macro!
 (defmacro ct/with-notmuch-as-compose-mail (&amp;rest body) &#x60;(progn (advice-add &#x27;compose-mail :override #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail) (unwind-protect (progn ,@body) (advice-remove &#x27;compose-mail #&#x27;notmuch-mua-mail)))) 
 I don&#x27;t understand the reason.
 Can anyone explain why the function doesn&#x27;t do its thing?

                    <span>Dear all.
 I have some text with selected phrases marked within asterisks (&quot;*&quot;) because org-mode syntax helps to visualize them inside the text, and I&#x27;d like to extract those phrases to another buffer.
 As I understand after some searching, one way is to use occur.
 However, I&#x27;m struggling (to say it lightly) to find a working regex for this occurrence that is &quot;whatever is between asterisks&quot;. I tried txt2regex but no success still...
 Does anyone knows a way to do this; or been in this situation and found a different approach? My lisp/regex fu is very much near the bottom, but I&#x27;m happy to learn.
 As always, thanks a lot for your time and attention. :)
 Best regards...
 ​
 PD: I&#x27;m thinking about ways to do semantic analysis with org-mode. If anyone&#x27;s interested on this we can arrange some collaboration. :)

                    <span>I have been using Emacs for many years. Thanks to the fantastic introduction to ELisp, I knew enough to &quot;configure&quot; Emacs. For some reason only recently have I started actually thinking about how I can make my computer-life easier; and Emacs is the one tool which poses least resistence when I try to. 
 I am kinda mad at myself for not doing this sooner, but also very happy that I finally did. I didn&#x27;t know where else to share this :-)
 In last few days, I have written 2 small bits of Elisp code (which took me embarassingly long to write, but the exercise was very rewarding).
  
First was publishing org subtrees as github issues; so I can stay in org-mode where I am very comfortable thinking and documenting my thoughts, and also push them to Github for colleagues. I can mark an issue as &quot;DONE&quot; and it closes the github issue, or change its content, or labels. 
 And a few minutes ago I wrote a little code to insert my org-roam notes as rust documentation comments
  
It&#x27;s not much, but it is honest work and I am happy I am finally doing it.

                    <span>I need to investigate text log files a lot. Emacs with auto-revert-tail-mode does the job almost fine, except when there are long lines (JSON/XML dumps, 1-40kb large).
 In that case Emacs lags a lot.
 I use fundamental-mode + add few font-lock-add-keywords by (highlighting for INFO/DEBUG/ERROR &amp; for date/time):
 http://hg.defun.work/dot-emacs/file/tip/mylisp/log4-hi-mode.el
 Even with plain fundamental-mode Emacs is unresponsible. I tried debug on error on C-g and the stacktrace is only native rendering function redisplay_internal.
 Just writing the post I tried so-long-mode instead of fundamental-mode and it is much better but still noticeably lagging. Few extra font-lock-add-keywords in so-long-mode doesn&#x27;t have huge impact: movement is just a bit slower than without.
 I don&#x27;t like to open Notepad++ just for log files, though it might be the proper solution...
 Any suggestions on debugging long line issue?
 Could we expect Emacs rendering of long lines improved? 
 I&#x27;m with Cygwin Emacs W32 27.2. Almost the same situation with Emacs 27.1 in WSL1 terminal. so-long-mode provides better experience, few font-lock-add-keywords ruin smoothness of movement.
 UPDATE I really need some highlighting for log files (date/time + INFO/DEBUG/ERROR): I expect some help from the tool.

                    <span>Hi all,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m trying to move to Emacs 28, from Emacs 27, but I&#x27;m having all kinds of weird problems with the packages I use.
 This is my config BTW: https://github.com/croqaz/dotfiles/blob/main/emacs/Emacs.org
 Basically I have &quot;random errors&quot; with random packages.
 First there&#x27;s IVY and the suite of packages, the error is:
 custom-initialize-reset: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, ../../../../../../.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy/ivy
 I comment ivy, counsel, swiper, ivy-rich, then I get the same error about another package. I comment it and I get another error, etc until I comment: centaur-tabs, doom-modeline, dimmer, which-key, maybe a few more.
 Then I delete ~/.emacs.default/straight/build/ivy and re-enable ivy AND move it immediately after use-package initialization and now it works!
 Then I re-enable all of them, one by one until they all work again!
 It&#x27;s like one package in there is causing some problems and makes all the other packages after it, to go crazy, that&#x27;s why I have to move them higher to make it work.
 I tried this so so so many times, that I made it work, but it&#x27;s a huge pain!
 Anybody else that understands the new version, that can help me?
 Thank you in advance!
 EDIT 1: Other than the problem with packages that I just mentioned, upgrading from Emacs 27 to 28 was painless.
 EDIT 2: Actually I also had the same trouble with yasnippet, company, js2, typescript and LSP packages...

                    <span>Hello again,
 I have a custom keyboard shortcut for moving quicker in VIM (for Emacs I use EVIL) where I hold down CTRL and press HJKL I move faster in the direction.
 Like this:
 ;; Movement changes - BUG: When I release CTRL it still does one last 5 line jump when pressing one of my keys (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-h&quot;) (kbd &quot;h5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-j&quot;) (kbd &quot;j5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-k&quot;) (kbd &quot;k5&quot;)) (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) (kbd &quot;l5&quot;)) 
 However, in EMACS when I use this, it does work. But once I let go off CTRL it does ONE last 5 jump, despite that it should have stopped. It also feels a bit like there is a small delay when doing this.
 Does anyone know a possible solution for this to make it more responsive and NOT have a &quot;last&quot; jump after letting CTRL go.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m back with some more question for my quest to move over to emacs. This time it&#x27;s only about HELM (there will be more questions I&#x27;m sure of it), but this thread is only for HELM. 
 I have a couple of question I&#x27;d love to get some help with. I&#x27;ve tried googling for them, but only found answers that didn&#x27;t really answer the question, or I couldn&#x27;t actually understand how the answer worked. :(
  
Is there a way to make helm-find-file to also look in sub-directories? When I googled for this, most people suggested Projectile with helm, but I could not get that working at all. There was no error or such, but it did not search in sub-directories. 
 
Is there anyway to make helm open a new window (or frame, not sure what it is called in emacs) at the center of the screen? There was some old questions here on this reddit for it, but they were 5 years old and then it seems like it wasn&#x27;t possible. However, I saw on the official documentation that it should be possible. I just can&#x27;t get it to work for me. I tried using Shackle to solve it as well, and that improved it, but still does not feel as good. 
 
 I believe that was my two helm questions I was mostly struggling with. 
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>I usually take daily notes and are categorized under a topic.
 I want to go through a specific category and want to get those in one single buffer (search or otherwise) with the contents.
 So let&#x27;s say I have a category country, I want to revisit all the details under this category.
 I am using spacemacs and projectile. A project search or org-roam-find usually lets me search the header but doesn&#x27;t say whats in the content.
 Options I know of - 
  
Creating an index of country headers and creating its own org-id for org-roam and visiting them manually
 
org-transclusion, where I could include all the same categories in one buffer and that would let me explore the content.
 
 What I am looking for specifically is something that would not require me to make changes like above which would require creating org id for categories which I can use in a buffer. I want a simple approach where a search query would give me what I am looking for in a separate buffer.
 Thanks in advance!

 I was using Emacs to edit some code for an upcoming deadline, I fat fingered something, Emacs exited to terminal. Usually this would be fine, I&#x27;d lost a few minutes of work, BUT it appears the files were rolled back to near when I started the Emacs session that terminated (multiple hours)
 I saved tens of times during the session, but nevertheless all my work appears to be gone. Of course it was as I was about to make a commit and push.
 I would really appreciate any insight into what could have possibly happened. My best guess is a shortcut for &#x60;git reset --hard&#x60;, but even my GitHub repo is more up to date than my local files now (but still at least an hour behind).
 With or without knowing what happened, is there a way to get these files back? Any help would be obviously be appreciated.
 Edit: change first line status to solved

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to implement a caesar cypher (see below). I have a function (caesar) that shifts right, e.g. caesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; would result in &quot;bcd&quot;, that works as intended. Now I was thinking to shift that to the left, I&#x27;d just have to adjust the the shift functions a little, but my current implementation doesn&#x27;t work around the edges, e.g. unCaesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; results in &quot;baz&quot; (?!) . I would love an explanation on why the shiftLeft functions behave like they do :)
 import Data.Char caesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String caesar _ [] &#x3D; [] caesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftRight n x : caesar n xs unCaesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String unCaesar _ [] &#x3D; [] unCaesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftLeft n x : unCaesar n xs shiftRight :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRight a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftRightUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftRightLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftLeft :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftLeft a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftLeftUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftLeftLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftRightLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftRightUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27; shiftLeftLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work yet shiftLeftLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftLeftUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work either shiftLeftUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27;

                    <span>I tried to solve Day 9, part one with algebraic graphs, a library I wanted to try out for a long time. I eventually failed(succeeded, thank to a performance hint of /u/jitwit), because my approach (build graph -&gt; remove all vertices that have a lower neighbour -&gt; count the value of the remaining vertices) relies on neighbours :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Graph a -&gt; Set a, which has an inefficient implementation (folds the whole graph, hence my algorithm is at least quadratic.) It still works for the example input tho! :)
 I would be glad about answer or general feedback about the my solution:
 -- I seem to need some kind of indexing, otherwise there is no way to distinguish vertexes. -- Question 1: Is there a smarter way to do it? -- 1 2 &#x3D;&gt; neighbours (vertex 1) will look for both 1&#x27;s ((0,0), 1) ((0,1…</span>

                    <span>Looking at the following syntax:
 getValues x1 &#x3D; do
 g &lt;- get
 let name &#x3D; &quot;aName&quot;
 return [Map.lookup x1 (myMap g)]
 ​
  
Does &lt;- get set g to the output of the return line? If not, what does g &lt;- get do?
 x1 appears to be the key to a map lookup, and myMap g is the map, but what is the relationship between the g in myMap g and the g in g &lt;- get. Recursive? There is no g as an argument to getValues.

                    <span>The stereotype is that only Senior Haskellers get hired. Perhaps it’s best to just ask any lurkers if their company actually hires and mentors Junior devs and is actively seeking them today. 
 So, who’s hiring Junior devs?

                    <span>I want to separate my daily tasks with appointments and all from the (embarrasingly) long list of badly maintained tasks -- overdue ones, soon-to-be due ones, and those that are schedule for a past date.
 It was simple enough to hide the overdue stuff from today&#x27;s timeline:
  (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot; &quot;) ;; Non-empty string to get empty line (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-ndays 1) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy (quote ((agenda time-up priority-down tag-up)))) ;; Do not include scheduled, due or overdue items here (org-deadline-warning-days 0) (org-scheduled-past-days 0) (org-deadline-past-days 0) (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t) (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t))) 
 But I cannot get that output to appear elsewhere, e.g. farther down, out of focus. This does display all overdue etc. taks, but also everything with a timestamp for today:
  (agenda &quot;&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Overdue&quot;) (org-agenda-time-grid nil) (org org-agenda-remove-timeranges-from-blocks t) (org-agenda-show-all-dates nil) (org-agenda-format-date &quot;&quot;) ;; Skip the date (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil) (org-agenda-span &#x27;day) (org-agenda-ndays 0) (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;todo &#x27;done)) ;; Show overdue items (org-scheduled-past-days 999) (org-deadline-past-days 999) ;; Ignore upcoming deadlines (org-deadline-warning-days 0))) 
 How can I get the bottom part to only show overdue etc. tasks, not those that are scheduled for today? 
 Do I have to write a (org-agenda-skip-function &#x27;(org-agenda-skip-entry-if &#x27;todo &#x27;done)) replacement in elisp that filters elements by date, i.e. &quot;not today&quot;? (How? :))

                    <span>Who thought that pressing enter on a link in org mode should not open the link when it&#x27;s in a table would be a reasonable default and why?
 And even if you have a good answer to the first question, why is there no variable that makes it possible to activate the behaviour 99% of users would except?
 I think naming funktions &quot;org-&quot; is a horrible design, and that is mostly unique for org-mode I know no other package that does that, so it&#x27;s breaking standard coding practises in emacs, but then also add such bad defaults and no way to configure it in a sane way drives me insane.
 It&#x27;s a enourmous effort to not use standard keys, but please I am not willing to press some finger destroying C-c C-o, my health is to important to me to want that, and in no case I ever want to behave  to jump to the next line when the cursor is on a link. Does really somebody want this behaviour this way? You prefer pressing C-c C-o over ?
 Sorry for the rant, I need to make some tea... cheers.
 org-return-follows-link is set to  in this example btw, so normally return would open the link, just not in a table.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to put together a guide to Clojure as I&#x27;ve been using it, as an org file, with little illustrative bits of Clojure source embedded in the file, which I have a cider-repl evaluate &amp; which puts the results of each code snippet below the source code in a #+RESULTS: block. That&#x27;s all well and good when the thing we&#x27;re interested in is the return value(s) of the snippet, but I&#x27;ve been looking to try &amp; get the standard output written into the results too, or in a similar block maybe labelled as +#OUTPUT:.
 Does anyone know how this might be done? I suspect there must be some kind of option passed in the +#BEGIN_SRC CLOJURE line, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find out what it should be.

                    <span>Type-checking plugins interface directly with GHC’s constraint solver. This means we need to have
a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,
to read Core (and, in particular, coercion…</span>

                    <span>Since structure notes and conceptual overviews can quickly become the foundation of actual projects, I thought we might all enjoy taking inventory of the past 3 months in terms of which structure notes we&#x27;ve tended to.
Since &quot;tending to&quot; isn&#x27;t trivial to figure out (without at least modification date sorting), might as well kick this off with new notes.
So in reverse order, here&#x27;s mine:
202112061117 § Emacs debugging tips: I had 3 notes about how to find out why Emacs is slow at times, and error debugging, and grouped them that day.
202111241304 § Drag and drop in macOS apps: Stuff I researched in 2017 just ... existed. So I created an overview and outlines topics a bit more orderly. Unlike the Emacs debugging tips above, this is not a mere collection of tips, but becomes more and more of …</span>

Memory Maintenance
Considering notes as proxies for memories, as the size and matrix of the archive grows, more time is spent maintaining existing notes. New notes should be created with abandon. Integrating them into the archive as wholly as I do. Editing them with abandon.
My new note-taking/zettelkasting mantra is: Create and edit with abandon. Trust that magic will happen.

  
I realized that in a few months, let alone years, at this rate most of my time would be spent on the maintenance of memories [notes]. I, as others have found, would be too busy maintaining these memories to use them. 1


What does it mean to &quot;use&quot; a memory? I can use a note&#x27;s contents, and its idea can be reignited in me. It can spark new and novel ideas.

                    <span>Hi all,
 Problem Description
 I&#x27;m trying to have the same .org file exported to LaTeX and ox-hugo. I use the template docsy template to export to which uses an alert shortcode to render an alert/info area.
 In LaTeX I use awesomebox to render a similar block.
 The LaTeX output works perfectly when I am using 
  #+begin_noteblock This is a noteblock info environment from the awesomebox LaTeX package. #+end_noteblock 
 Now I want that noteblock to render into the following when using the ox-hugo export:
  {{% alert title&#x3D;&quot;Warning&quot; color&#x3D;&quot;warning&quot; %}} This is a warning. {{% /alert %}} 
 I found I should be able to use org-special-block-extras to do this conversion, but I seem to be getting it wrong, as on export no conversion happens. As I though there is maybe something wrong with the condit…</span>

                    <span>Hello there guys.
 So, I&#x27;ve recently got the source for Emacs 28.0.90 from https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git and built and installed it following the instructions. More specifically, I ran the following:
  
./autogen.sh
 /configure --with-native-compilation&#x3D;yes --with-json&#x3D;yes --with-gnutls&#x3D;yes --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid --with-mailutils&#x3D;yes --with-rsvg&#x3D;yes
 make -j4
 sudo make install
  
The compilation and install were successful, as well as the Doom install. However when I try to run Emacs I get the following error message:
 error: Invalid hash table rehash size, 1.0
 When I try to run an Emacs client (after successfully starting a daemon) I get a more elaborate error message:
 *ERROR*: Error in a Doom startup hook: server-after-make-frame-hook, doom-init-theme-h, (error &quot;Invalid hash table rehash size&quot; 1.0)
 The same happens when build and install Emacs 27.2 (source also from Savannah), without, of course, the native compilation flag on configure.
 I saw that some Spacemacs users ran into the same problem and submitted this issue. I tried, as suggested there, to run an apt upgrade, but had no success.
 Btw, I&#x27;m using Ubuntu 20 and Emacs works fine in the terminal.
 Has anyone ran into the same issue? How can I fix this? 
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using lsp-mode for a while now with eslint for my Node work stuff, and aside from screwing up some paths when initially installing it, everything worked just fine. But now we&#x27;re starting to transition to Typescript.
 I installed the ts-ls server without issue, and it runs just fine on *.ts files, but it&#x27;s also running for *.js files. Even stranger is that eslint is running at the same time! Now that both of them are running at the same time for a single file, syntax highlighting doesn&#x27;t work (although I get warnings and errors underlined as I expect). How do I configure this so that I don&#x27;t have both running?

 https://www.lawfareblog.com/feed?post_type&#x3D;all
 When I configure this in elfeed and use the tag +lawfare, elfeed shows only 3 items all from today Dec 8.
 When I configure the same feed in newsboat, I&#x27;m presented with 25 items going back to Dec 2.
 Does anyone know why this would be and if it is possible for elfeed to show me the same articles as newsboat?
 Thank you

                    <span>I have seen in youtube videos when the author is typing a command with M-x, the minibuffer shows possible completions and even shortcut keys for those completion commands. Can somebody point me to relevant package/blog post/any link?

                    <span>Got curious about bookmarks+ and downloaded it via quelpa today. After installation, I noticed a new behaviour when visiting dired buffers. 
 I visit a dired buffer, all details are hidden as per my config, but after 3 seconds or so, it suddenly shows all my details. Pressing &#x27;g&#x27; reverts it to the original setup, only to get overridden again after 3 seconds. I&#x27;ve singled it down to bookmarks+, since de-installation removes this bug.
 I&#x27;m posting it in this sub-reddit, since I couldn&#x27;t find a github for bookmarks+.

                    <span>I used Vim a lot back in the day, but eventually switch to Emacs for lisp.
 I&#x27;m trying out Doom Emacs, to get inspired for config improvements, and Vim style editing for lisps is very painful for me, post paredit.

                    <span>I really like that Emacs automatically knows where to indent some code and just sticks it there. 
 Doom, for some reason isn&#x27;t replicating this functionality. I see that in my JS file it&#x27;s using rjsx-indent-line as the indent function, and when I call that via elisp, I see the expected behavior, but when I repeatedly press tab, the line indents further than it should.
 Anybody know how to turn that off?

                    <span>On behalf of maintainers I&#x27;m happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.2.0 is finally released.
 Highlights from the changelog:
  
New functions: 
 ultra-fast SIMD-based isValidUtf8 validator,
 foldr&#x27;, foldr1&#x27;, scanl1, scanr, scanr1, takeEnd, dropEnd, takeWhileEnd, dropWhileEnd, spanEnd, breakEnd for lazy ByteString,
 writeFile to dump Builder directly,
 fromFilePath and toFilePath for locale-aware conversions.
 
 Performance improvements: 
 speed up floatDec and doubleDec up to 10x using Ryu algorithm,
 new SIMD-based count is up to 5x faster,
 improve inlining of foldl, foldl&#x27;, foldr, foldr&#x27;, mapAccumL, mapAccumR, scanl, scanr and filter,
 faster internal loop in unfoldrN,
 use a static lookup table for Base16 Builders.
 
 Add Lift instances for ByteString and ShortByteString.
 Put HasCallStack constraints onto partial functions.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:

                    <span>I am trying to write an IO action that bugs the user to enter a number within a certain range.
 Since the user is entering the number from the keyboard, I have to allow the possibility that
 the user types in something that cannot be converted into an Int value.
 ​
 This is what I have so far
 ​
 action2 :: Int -&gt; IO Int
 action2 n &#x3D; do
 putStrLn &quot;\nEnter action2 ...&quot;
 ​
 let m &#x3D; 2 * n 
 ​
 putStrLn $ &quot;n &#x3D; &quot; ++ (show n)
 putStrLn &quot;... leave action2\n&quot;

                    <span>If I were a teacher of high-schoolers wanting to connect some underlying theory to Haskell, could I explain Haskell list comprehensions as basically just a Cartesian/cross product machine? Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.
 Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the &quot;Translations&quot; box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I&#x27;d like to know how and why.

                    <span>I am trying to make an Akka actor system and hoping to take advantage of discovery to automatically fulfill actor dependencies. I have put together a pattern that I believe should work using the receptionist, but I&#x27;m seeing some strange error that I have not had luck deciphering. I asked on stack overflow about it, but didn&#x27;t seem to get much traction there. I&#x27;m hoping bringing attention to it here will help me get some answers:
 Combining Akka (typed) actor pools and discovery to fulfill actor dependencies
 Any ideas??

                    <span>I want to solve this problem:
 I have a complex case class with many fields 
 case class Foo(v1: String,..., v10: Int) 
 For tests I want to create some default value for it without manually passing all the parameters.
 val foo &#x3D; Default[Foo].value 
 I think tt could be done with typeclass
 trait Default[T] { def value: T } implicit val defaultString &#x3D; new Default[String] { def value &#x3D; &quot;&quot; } implicit val defaultInt &#x3D; new Default[Int] { def value &#x3D; 0 } 
 and derivation for case classes with magnolia
 Is there any implementation for something like this?

                    <span>I have been learning Scala for quite sometime now and found it a nice language. Coming from the background of JavaScript and Python, I found Scala to be a really cool language.
 What I want to ask this community is that how many of you use Scala especially to build microservices using Play Framework... I feel like diving super deep into it but I plan to learn typescript as well... Now I know typescript is definitely a big game player but Scala is something I have been enjoying a bit...
 Is it worth learning Scala in 2022 or should I go with something like golang or Rust? I know it depends on what things I am dealing with but in that scenario javascript and python are answer to almost all my questions Unless performance walks in and now even modern optimized frameworks are handling that well too.
 As a developer, keeping all your love and affection for Java based languages aside do you think it&#x27;s worth investing in Scala and Play Framework?

                    <span>Dear r/scala,
 I am a big fan of SBT that is my main tools for debuging while coding. However, sometimes I can have like 30 errors at once. It is required to debug from first to last since the last errors may be consequent to the firsts one. In this case I have to scroll back to find the start of the error thread which I feel is a lost of time. 
 Do you know a way to reverse this error thread, so that the first errors are shown at the bottom? Or to limit the number of errors shown?
 ​
 Thx

                    <span>Hi I am looking at something similar to what other IDEs support, and that is searching for a Classes(Java, Cpp etc) within the included libraries and the project itself through maven(for Java) or Cmake (for Cpp) for example. It is clear that the language servers know about them, because they are able to properly find and import them, but i would like to be able to explicitly search for them by name (like C-x C-f).
 Is there a generic lsp feature / is that part of the spec , or each server is different in that aspect. Any help is appreciated, thanks !
 Another additional question - how does the language server access those symbols, say the Java language server, is it doing that through maven&#x27;s m2 repository or does it keep a stash on its own.

                    <span>Hi Emacs friends,
 been trying to solve this issue for quite a while now (google, posts). I swear, I did everything short of asking it here.
 Different terminal emulators as well (Terminal, iTerm2, kitty). I am on macOS.
 I would love to use my arrow keys in the non gui version of Emacs but they seem to be weirdly mapped:
 ​
 UP:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then A
 (GUI Emacs: evil-previous-line)
 
 Down:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then B
 (GUI Emacs: evil-next-line)
 
 Right:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-forward-char)
 
 Left:
 esc-map O
 global-map C-t f F
 global-map M-O
 and then C
 (GUI Emacs: evil-backward-char)
 ​
 ​
 I have tried few remapping by suggestions that do not work at all – currently:
 ​
 (unless (display-graphic-p)
 (progn
 (defvar arrow-keys-map (make-sparse-keymap) &quot;Keymap for arrow keys&quot;)
 (define-key esc-map &quot;O&quot; arrow-keys-map)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;A&quot; &#x27;previous-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;B&quot; &#x27;next-line)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;C&quot; &#x27;forward-char)
 (define-key arrow-keys-map &quot;D&quot; &#x27;backward-char)))
 ​
 Nope. Doesn&#x27;t work.
 HELP.

                    <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;m trying to switch (once again, 2nd try) from my tmux, vim setup, to emacs. Mostly because I do common lisp development, but I have 2 relative big issues regarding my workflow. First, on every project I have a script that builds tmux session with corresponding services running (redis, postgresdb, vim, custom services, etc) I guess I can simulate this using a elisp file on each project? Is that possible? . Second, I use a lot M-x compile command, but my root keeps moving on each window. It&#x27;s different than vim, that the root is where I executed vim. On the other hand, SLIME is really cool, and I&#x27;m really eager to use org-mode more when I solve this 2 issues. Thank you!

                    <span>When writing Emacs Lisp programs, is it possible to automatically insert require forms?
 If not, is there an easy way to find out which ones you need to add? I have caught a bunch using elint-current-buffer, and compilation helps, but these are a bit clumsy.

                    <span>Did anyone else notice high cpu usage of emacs compiled with pgtk runing in native wayland?
 I am running it under -Q and the process go up and down at around 30/40% of a single core on a non beefy laptop even idled with no buffer open.
 I am guessing this is inherent on how wayland protocol works where emacs+pgtk spend its time doing the redrawing?

                    <span>Inspired by recent, well-known articles on Embark and on Avy, I&#x27;ve started testing Embark over the past few days - and it&#x27;s already turning into the interface I always wanted and only sort of knew I needed. While it&#x27;s extremely useful out-of-the-box, I&#x27;ve already found a few cases where I would want to use it but can&#x27;t, because it doesn&#x27;t understand the construct at point. Examples:
  
Org mode timestamps - to provide operations like activate/inactivate, change, pop calendar to that date, bump by repeater, etc.
 
Org mode headlines - pretty much everything you can do on those, that Org mode has bound to countless weird keys. Including &quot;speed commands&quot;, most of which could work without quitting the Embark &quot;prompter&quot;, the way e.g. navigating to next/prev symbol works.
 
Org mode tables - embark-cycle could be able to switch between cell, row, column, whole table (perhaps also stopping at &quot;rowgroup&quot;, &quot;column group&quot; and &quot;subtable&quot;, which would be rectangular areas that are bound by hlines and column group markers) - each of those would have its own contextual commands available. For example, &quot;eval formula&quot;, so one doesn&#x27;t have to remember reference syntax and how many times to press C-u before pressing C-c &#x3D;.
 
Syntactic elements and expressions in programming language modes, allowing for e.g. language-specific actions.
 
 From the looks of it, it&#x27;s not that hard to write any - the tricky bit being target classifiers. I&#x27;m going to take a stab at adding some classifiers and action keymaps for things I commonly interact with - but I&#x27;d like to avoid repeating work that might already be done better. Hence my question: are there any &quot;extension packages&quot; that enable Embark to recognize more target types? Or, are any of you already using hand-written ones (and if yes, can you share them)?

                    <span>We have all seen Emacs be described as so many different things: a text editor, not just a text editor, an operating system, a Lisp interpreter, and a *million other things.
 Describing what Emacs is can be super difficult, as it is different things to different people. Some use it for programming or general writing, some for organisation, project management, email, web browsing, controlling media, and a **million more things. Basically, people use Emacs for whatever they want, which is fantastic! 
 This makes it difficult to describe what exactly Emacs is to people outside our friendly little circle. Other editors can be described nearly completely with a short familiar phrase. Vim is an efficient text editor, VSCode is a powerful modern IDE, Vi is a last resort. But Emacs doesn&#x27;t have a consistent and universally agreeable short description. 
 My question is, what is Emacs to you? How would you describe it succinctly to someone who has heard about it, but not sure what all the fuss is about? 
 My humble submission would be: &quot;the whatever you want text interface.&quot;
 *Mild exaggeration, but you get the picture
 ** Under exaggeration :)

                    <span>NOTE: I usually use emacs in the CLI, not in the GUI.
 I found out about emacs some months back. When I initially tried out emacs; it felt complicated to use. After I practiced emacs over time; I started to like emacs.
  
I could use lynx inside emacs to form a psuedomultitab browser. Eventually I learned that emacs has a built-in browser eww. I favored that browser over lynx.
 
It was nice to be able to containerize workspaces, like for programming, school work, miscellaneous stuff, and just general browsing without having to deal with floating windows.
 
 I have Autism and ADHD; emacs helps with dealing with Autism, because it does not give much lack of sensory information; emacs is hyperresponsive, unlike VSCode, so it does not hurt my eyes when I try to do heavy-load tasks.
 emacs also helps with ADHD, since I can easily organize stuff with org-mode. I can also easily navigate buffers without a pointing device; I am uncomfortable with pointing devices (mouses and touchpads), despite using them for 11 years. Pointing devices seem to really mess with me and I can&#x27;t control them as well (as I can with a keyboard).
 EDIT: My only complaint is that I wish I could display images in CLI emacs, like running viu on links to images after eww finishes loading. That complaint is not a criticism on emacs itself though.

                    <span>Initially, I thought using hex values like #042e3a would grant me more freedom to choose the color but it turns out that apparently emacs will try to find the closest color it has when you supply a color that is not in its own color set.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I&#x27;m doing Python web development in emacs using lsp-mode(I want to switch over to eglot-mode eventually when the pull-requests get pushed and html/css/js work automatically with elgot-mode, so keep this in mind) as the IDE for the Python and HTML files, which is working great. But when doing Jinja/Django specific syntax(for example in an HTML file), the auto-completion does not work? Is there an lsp-mode/eglot-mode for this to be used with use-package?
 If not then is there a way to declare web-mode in a use-package, where this functionality can be set, in which the corresponding Jinja/Django engine is activated based on a corresponding hook?
 I&#x27;d prefer to stick with the .py and .html extensions, but if that&#x27;s not possible, the I could try out extensions like .djhtml to be used in the web-mode hook in the declared use-package.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

 no different from just
 -1 :: Natural

 With the first equating Haskell seems to wait until I call myNat to say something, and then it gives what seems a cryptic error message. What&#x27;s going on under the hood here?

                    <span>File links break all the time, for instance after reorganize your directory structure. This can take many time to fix broken link manually. I need a solution to prevent all file reference in my org-agenda-files are broken.
 My current solution to prevent the issue is to use hardlink in org-agenda-files &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 assume I want add /a/b/c.org into emacs variable org-agenda-files
 mkdir ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files
 create hardlink of c.org in dir org-agenda-files
 ln /a/b/c.org ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org 
 add ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org to emacs variable org-agenda-files

 However, this solution has some limit. For instance, - the absolute path of &quot;c.org&quot; become ~/.emacs.d/org-agenda-files/c.org. So its relative link are broken.
 LinkTek propose a much better solution: https://linktek.com/do-this-one-trick-and-never-worry-about-broken-file-links-again/
  
LinkTek creates an additional association between the parent file and each of its child files. LinkFixer Advanced uses that secondary association to quickly and automatically fix all the links that get broken by whatever changes someone makes to your files.
  
What solution you use for the problem of broken link? Exist an implementation of solution proposed by LinkTek for org mode?

                    <span>I use ebib and citar. Both are awesome, but have different defaults when creating notes files for bibliographic entries. I wanted to unify them (so that my notes would always be of the same format). So I defined a wrapper function:
 (defun my/citar-ebib-notes-format-wrapper (key _entry _filepath) &quot;Wrapper so that citar&#x27;s notes function can inherit from ebib&#x27;s. 
 Passes KEY to ebib--notes-fill-template&#x27;, along with the value ofebib--cur-db&#x27; if defined, or the first item of &#x60;ebib-preload-bib-files&#x27; if not. _ENTRY and _FILEPATH are ignored.&quot; (require &#x27;ebib-notes) (if-let ((cell (ebib--notes-create-new-note key (or ebib--cur-db (car ebib-preload-bib-files))))) (progn (display-buffer (car cell)) (goto-char (cdr cell)))))
 This only works while ebib is running. While it&#x27;s not running I get an error message format-spec: Invalid format character: ‘%T, which is strange, because the formatting seems to rely on ebib-notes-template-specifiers, which I don&#x27;t change, and which is initialised in ebib-notes.el (so should be available when the body of the function runs). Changing the notes template variable so that it doesn&#x27;t include %T helps, and iterating on this reveals that the formatter errors for all specifiers except %K, which it handles fine. I&#x27;m very confused.
 I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of to get this to work, to no avail. What&#x27;s going on? Any help greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Just today I startted getting the following errors after using straight to pull the most recent version of org.
 Error (use-package): org/:config: Symbol’s function definition is void: org-element-cache-reset [2 times]
 Error (use-package): evil-embrace/:catch: Symbol’s value as variable is void: org-org-menu
 WARNING: No org-loaddefs.el file could be found from where org.el is loaded.
 You need to run &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make autoloads&quot; from Org lisp directory
 The only notable parts of my config related to installing org are as follows:
 (require &#x27;package) (setq package-archives &#x27;((&quot;gnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;melpa&quot; . &quot;https://melpa.org/packages/&quot;) (&quot;nongnu&quot; . &quot;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/&quot;))) 
 and
 (straight-use-package &#x27;org) (straight-use-package &#x27;(org-contrib :type git :host github :repo &quot;emacsmirror/org-contrib&quot;)) 
 I Know there have been some recent changes with org mode installation and I have seen some posts here but I have gotten confused and can&#x27;t seem to figure out what I am doing wrong. Notably, I have not changed anything in my config lately that I would imaging would have anything to do with installing org....
 ​
 EDIT: I take it back. 
 I did recently add 
 :hook (org-mode . turn-on-org-cdlatex)
 and removing that line does seem to fix things but I have no idea why. 
 Any help would be most appreciated.

                    <span>In NixOS, I have installed emacs:
 $ emacs --version GNU Emacs 27.2 Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc. GNU Emacs comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. You may redistribute copies of GNU Emacs under the terms of the GNU General Public License. For more information about these matters, see the file named COPYING. 
 What does it mean when I start its daemon:
 $ emacs --daemon Warning: due to a long standing Gtk+ bug https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/221 Emacs might crash when run in daemon mode and the X11 connection is unexpectedly lost. Using an Emacs configured with --with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid does not have this problem. Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/t/.emacs.d/init.el’: File is missing: Cannot open load file, No such file or directory, go-mode-autoloads To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the cause of the error in your initialization file. Start Emacs with the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace. Starting Emacs daemon. 
 ?
 I also feel that ~/.emacs.d/init.el isn&#x27;t executed when I start the emacs, because I added (desktop-save-mode 1) in it, and when I exit and start emacs daemon again, it doesn&#x27;t reopen the files that were opened when I exited it.
 Thanks.

                    <span>Hi!
 These are a few small scripts I use related to Emacs and Org-mode. I recently added some descriptions for each. I hope they are also useful for someone out there.
 https://github.com/psamim/dotfiles#related-to-emacs-org-mode-or-ledger-cli
 Please advise me if you have a better suggestion for any of them!
 Thanks

                    <span>Hi,
 I am a still new to emacs, and so I am not really sure what this error means.
 &#x60;forge-db: BUG: The Forge database scheme changed and there is no upgrade path&#x60;
 ​
 But I get it every time I start an application such as magit or I try to use dired for the first time.
 Thanks

                    <span>I use dired with the variable delete-by-moving-to-trash set to t. But sometimes I want to delete a file (or directory) without sending it to trash. Here is how I modified the dired-deletion-commands to toggle their trashing-behavior when called with a prefix.
 (defun my/dired-do-flagged-delete (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-flagged-delete))) (defun my/dired-do-delete (&amp;optional arg) (interactive &quot;P&quot;) (let ((delete-by-moving-to-trash (xor arg delete-by-moving-to-trash))) (dired-do-delete))) 
 All I have to do now is bind these functions to x and D in dired-mode-map
 Of course after that, the default reaction to prefixes is lost. Personally I don&#x27;t care, because I never used it. Others might think differently about that.

                    <span>I am unable to get show-trailing-whitespace to work. Here is a test I did,
 emacs -q foo.txt 
 In Emacs I typed these commands,
 M-: (setq show-trailing-whitespace t) RET M-: (setq-default show-trailing-whitespace t) RET 
 Then typed 3 lines in the .txt buffer where every line contains a trailing whitespace. The trailing whitespaces do not get highlighted.
 I also checked C-h o trailing-whitespace RET and it shows that this face is set to black foreground on red background. Still I don&#x27;t see the trailing spaces highlighted in this manner.
 What is going on and how to fix it?

                    <span>Since 1.0.0 is released, people said they have hard time to get started with meow because the tutorial is not enough.
 And now we are at 1.1.0, there are some minor fixs, but for the most important
  
We have M-x meow-tutor
 
We have a WIP doom module for meow
 
 Great jobs from the contributors, we also enabled discussions.

                    <span>data Letters &#x3D; A | B | C deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum, Show) instance (Eq a, Ord a, Bounded a, Enum a) &#x3D;&gt; Enum [a] where succ &#x3D; reverse . succ&#x27; . reverse where succ&#x27; :: [a] -&gt; [a] succ&#x27; (x:xs) | x  Buildable a where build :: a -&gt; a -&gt; [a] build start end &#x3D; reverse $ build&#x27; start end [] where build&#x27; :: a -&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] build&#x27; x y l | x &gt;&#x3D; (minBound :: a) &amp;&amp; x &#x3D; (minBound :: a) &amp;&amp; x &lt;&#x3D; y &amp;&amp; x &#x3D;&#x3D; (maxBound :: a) &#x3D; l++[x] | otherwise &#x3D; l instance Buildable Letters 
 I have defined succ so that it can be applied to all permutation of [Letters] with a ordered sequence like this:
 succ [A,A,A] &#x3D; [A,A,B] succ [A,A,B] &#x3D; [A,A,C] succ [A,A,C] &#x3D; [A,B,A] ... succ [C,C,B] &#x3D; [C,C,C] -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined 
 build in Buildable is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:
 build A B &#x3D; [A,B] build B C &#x3D; [B,C] build A C &#x3D; [A,B,C] 
 ​
 How do I apply Buildable on [Letters] such that I can call build like this:
 build [A] [B] &#x3D; [[A],[B]] build [A,A] [B,B] &#x3D; [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]] build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] &#x3D; [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]] build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] &#x3D; [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]] 
 It seems like I have to define what maxBound and minBound is for [Letters] if I do instance Buildable [a]. How do I do that?

                    <span>I want to get back into Haskell. I used it a lot a few years ago. I just installed haskell-platform on Ubuntu which seems to be the recommended download. 
 Should I be using stack to make Haskell projects? stack wasn&#x27;t included in the haskell-platform download so is there a different workflow I should be using? I have some projects on github that I made with stack.
 Any help or other new advice would be nice

 Scala inline given unionEncoder[U]: Encoder[U] &#x3D; myMacro 
 Having the type constraint be A, B, U &lt;: A | B seems to result in any type being allowed since for any T, you can say it&#x27;s T | T. Also, yes, I can check if the type is a union in the macro, but that doesn&#x27;t stop the implicit resolution to land on unionEncoder in the first place. Any ideas?

 Endless bridges the gap between Cats Effect and Akka Cluster Sharding. It makes it possible to define abstract repository and entity algebras in tagless-final style to describe distributed event sourced domains seamlessly within functional codebases. I&#x27;m exited about it, let me know what you think!

                    <span>I’m not very familiar with scala and it’s ecosystem. Here’s the solution I envision with rust-like pseudocode.

 How do I do the same in scala? Preferably with the help of finagle infrastructure.

 jsonrpc.el looks like a useful library for this task but I can&#x27;t seem to find any examples of it&#x27;s usage in a real world application.
 There is documentation in the official manual but it isn&#x27;t particularly useful.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction or provide me a good example the would be very helpful :)

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m having an issue where emacs seems to freeze randomly on me (with no error message viewable from the GUI). It doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to a particular command (most recently it happened while I was just navigating the cursor around a buffer). Is there anything I can do / try to get a more helpful error message?
 Sorry if that&#x27;s a silly question, I&#x27;m new here.
 Some info about my setup in case it&#x27;s relevant:

                    <span>I love org-mode, but there is one thing I have always wondered: why are the default keybinds so weird? org-do-promote and its friends are by default all bound to something plus an arrow key, which completely breaks your workflow as your hand leaves the home row. I use these commands quite often, and if I had not rebound them, they would be literally the only reason I ever hit the arrow keys.
 Is there a rationale behind this?

                    <span>I have the following groceries.org: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +STARTUP: nologdone
 +FILETAGS: SHOPPING_LIST
  
Groceries :PROPERTIES: :LOGGING: nologdone :END: ** Produce *** NEXT Tomatoes &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
But only the LOGGING property in the Groceries headline works. If I remove it, the &quot;nologdone&quot; in the startup doesn&#x27;t prevent logging. 
 In a bunch of similar files I don&#x27;t need a root headline and would like to just rely on the STARTUP.
 What am I missing?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a PhD student in Earth Sciences currently trying to switch all my Python programming from Spyder to emacs (because emacs is just all I need). 
 I am pretty sure more people than enough tried to make emacs as close as Spyder for me to find somewhere an el file ready to use with the Spyder theme and just the few useful things I need (basically an iPython console in another window, autocompletion, black formatting on save, cell highlighting and few other things)... However I can&#x27;t find anything. Thefore I&#x27;m pretty sure I am not looking at the right places. Do you know where I could find such a file? Or at least part of it (like the spyder theme)?
 Thank you a lot in advance for your help!

                    <span>TL;DR:
  
Download here: https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds/releases/tag/Emacs-28.0.90-pretest
 System Requirements: 
 macOS 10.15.x or later (uses Rosetta2 on Apple Silicon machines).
 Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS will prompt to install them on first use of native compilation).
 
 All dependencies, including libgccjit, are bundled into Emacs.app, and have been tested to work with native compilation on fresh macOS VMs with nothing installed except Xcode Command Line Tools.
 Native Apple Silicon builds are not yet available, and depend on GitHub-hosted Action runners adding Apple Silicon hardware. See Issue #4 for details. But the Intel-based builds have been reported to work fine on Apple Silicon via Rosetta2.

                    <span>I am currently using lsp-mode with Haskell in Doom Emacs. Unfortunately, when I try to open my Xmonad config in Emacs, my memory usage spikes due to the Haskell language server(takes apprx. 1.8GB) and my screen is filled with recommendations as in the image. 
 I wish to remove the gray inline requests and only keep the light-bulb requests on the right. I have looked through this page: https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/ but I cannot find out how to remove the inline requests. Any help with this is greatly appreciated. I have also noticed that the inline requests are actually duplicated, which is even more confusing. 
 For the high memory usage, I don&#x27;t even know where to begin with reducing it. It&#x27;s so high that it completely eclipses the memory usage of the rest of Emacs. 
 Thanks in advance for any help

                    <span>I am a data scientist, I work in python with pandas for manipulating data on a daily basis. I love emacs but there is one feature that makes me open up Pycharm every day instead and that is its “sciview”, which displays dataframes in a “spreadsheet” manner which really helps when debugging/exploring.
 EIN has a function to do exactly this and visualize the dataframe in SES mode: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook/blob/d62dc59869d436385efa940ba20a737bb8b9e5fd/lisp/ein-pytools.el#L222 . It relies on a jupyter kernel to retrieve the data, I would like to adapt that to dap-mode (or any standard python process accessible through a REPL) but my elisp-fu is way too poor.
 Has anybody here solved this problem before?

 ELISP&gt; (cider-sync-request:complete &quot;re-frame&quot; (cider-completion-get-context) ) *** Eval error *** No linked CIDER sessions 
 in the context of this comment https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/issues/732#issuecomment-986043891 from the same ticket.
 So then, my question would be, how would link a cider session? My guess is that the (cider-completion-get-context) value isn&#x27;t returning the cider session.

                    <span>Comming to Haskell has made me feel like I&#x27;m learning to program all over again. How would you suggest is the best way to unlearn all of the habits and design patterns from imperative programming? For example whenever I work with lists I want to instinctively loop through them which of course you cannot do with Haskell.

                    <span>I&#x27;m reading through Retrocomputing with Clash. The example projects use stack to build. I&#x27;m trying to use iohk&#x27;s haskell.nix with it. For the one example project clash-calculator, when I run nix develop and it builds clash-ghc I get the following warning
 Warning: This package indirectly depends on multiple versions of the same package. This is very likely to cause a compile failure. package ghc (ghc-8.10.7) requires ghci-8.10.7 package clash-ghc (clash-ghc-1.4.6) requires ghci-8.10.7-G6m9jPL8HBD2MenaVWt4To 
 Then later there are a few errors that indicate that this warning is indeed the problem.
 How can I fix this? I could give up on the nixification of the project and just use stack, but I&#x27;d prefer not to.

                    <span>The title may not be the appropriate way of solving this issue but I feel it may be a way to the solution.
 I have a function that takes in something and returns a list of that something changed in multiple ways.
 The way it is changed is by checking the input against many if statements, the if statements only differ by the fact the values within them increment up and down. However, I don&#x27;t think this is a good solution to this.
 The way that it is changed shows a pattern so I think I should be able to solve it recursively but I can&#x27;t figure out how.
 I will give an example of a situation similar to mine, this function is useless and is just an arbitrary example of my situation:
 function :: Shape -&gt; [Shape]
 function shape@(Triangle sidea sideb sidec) &#x3D;
  [if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (7) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (2) then changeSideC shape (2) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (6) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (3) then changeSideC shape(3) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (5) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (4) then changeSideC shape (4) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (4) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (5) then changeSideC shape (5) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (3) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (6) then changeSideC shape (6) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (2) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (7) then changeSideC shape (7) else Triangle [][][],
 if length sidec &lt;&#x3D; (1) &amp;&amp; sidecChangeable sideb sidea (8) then changeSideC shape (8) else Triangle [][][]]
 I have put the recurring pattern in brackets so you can see what I am talking about. How would I reduce this function down so that it would work even if you made the numbers much larger? Is there a recursive way of doing this?
 I feel that this is possible but I am at a loss on how to implement this.
 This is my first post so go easy on me if I&#x27;m missing something.

I just learned these new functions, map, filter, foldr and foldl, but i cant seem to understand when to use fold and what both of them do, in which way i want to apply them, specially with more complex functions associated, i can understand the fold (+) for example. 
 Can anyone elucidate me about these functions, im kind of stuck here.

 Also if I wanted to get an average test score from a list of tuples which had a name and their score but a person could appear more than once, how would I do that?
 Lastly, if I had a list of players and the teams they have played for, and I wanted to get a list of players that have played for every team how would I do that?

 Is there a way, in &#x60;stack.yaml&#x60; or &#x60;package.yaml&#x60;, that I gate a dependency for a specific GHC version?

 I do not know where to look. I am not used to asking questions here, so sorry if the format is wrong, but believe me I took my time before posting and read whatever resources I thought could be helpful.
 (I use a standard configuration, nothing fancy)

                    <span>Currently all my methods for parsing Terms are declared within the master macro, and usable only there, like so:
 def masterMacro[T:Type](quoted: Expr[T])(using Quotes) &#x3D; import quotes.reflect._ // helpers for Term level parsing object Extractors: object OnTerm: def unapply(expr: Expr[_]): Option[Term] &#x3D; Some(expr.asTerm) // etc // main macro logic 
 How do I move Extractors out of the macro? One would like something like
 // top level object Extractors(using Quotes): import quotes.reflect._ object OnTerm: def unapply(expr: Expr[_]): Option[Term] &#x3D; Some(expr.asTerm) 
 But this fails to parse with objects cannot have parameters. Dotty compiler quotes module has constructions like
 val reflect: reflectModule trait reflectModule { self: reflect.type &#x3D;&gt; 
 but I don&#x27;t understand the syntax nor whether it can be applied to what I need. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>When I&#x27;m programming in C using lsp-mode and clangd as my language server, lsp-ui-doc displays documentation like this, which is what I prefer, but it only does this if the function is defined in the file that I&#x27;m currently viewing. If I move to a different file and #include the file containing the definition, and then call the function, lsp-ui-doc ignores the docstring, which is not ideal.
 Is there a way to make lsp-ui-doc display documentation in the same way it does in the first case, everywhere? Sorry if this has been asked before, I couldn&#x27;t find anything about it while googling. Here is my settings file.

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to know what you people do in these situations.
 Namely, I&#x27;d like to have coherent and consistent keybindings accross different modes, and I&#x27;d like to have this information quite visible in one place so that I can generally decide for all prog-modes or text modes what are the best keybindings for me.
 Right now I have defined a macro that kind of does this for me, a minimal example for markup languages would be
 emacs-lisp (defcustom ale-markup-mode-maps &#x27;(:org org-mode-map :latex latex-mode-map :tex TeX-mode-map :md markdown-mode-map) &quot;Maps to be added to the markup ale mode&quot; :group &#x27;ale) 
 Here I define in a plist the maps that I am interested in and the keyword is important. Later I can define the keybindings and I can override the functions for different maps according to the keywords I defined in the plist above.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (ale-define-key normal ale-markup-mode-maps &quot;C-i&quot; (:md markdown-cycle :all org-cycle) ;; images &quot;C-c C-i C-l&quot; org-latex-preview &quot;C-c C-i C-t&quot; (:all org-toggle-inline-images :md markdown-toggle-inline-images) &quot;C-c C-i C-i&quot; #&#x27;org-redisplay-inline-images
 ;; references &quot;C-c C-r C-d&quot; papis-extract-citations-into-dblock &quot;C-c C-r C-i&quot; papis-org-ref-insert-citation-from-query &quot;C-c C-r C-o&quot; (:all org-ref-insert-cite-link :tex reftex-citation :latex reftex-citation) &quot;C-c C-r C-r&quot; (:all org-ref-insert-ref-link :tex reftex-label :latex reftex-label)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 How would you do this, is there a canonical way of doing this that I am missing out?
 Just to be clear, I don&#x27;t mean defining a minor mode where to have a set of keybindings, because the keybinding will be different depending on the mode that I&#x27;m in, but if I&#x27;m in org or markdown I want semantically &#x3D;C-i&#x3D; to mean cycling, but the function is different.
 Thanks people!

                    <span>So I decided to try and use org-agenda after using it on and off for a while, and on my new setup it never seems to work. To be more elaborate, I have files added to my .emacs config, but every time I try to pull up any org-agenda view, it gives me the following error: Invalid function (date date)
 I&#x27;ve done a bit of googling and I can&#x27;t seem to find an exact answer on what this is, or what&#x27;s causing it. For reference, here&#x27;s my exact setup:
 Emacs: Version 26.3

 .emacs file: https://pastebin.com/ju2sfadG
 If anyone could help or even just point me in the right direction that would be great, thanks in advanced.

                    <span>Hi all -- I&#x27;ve put a repo on github for building emacs on macos. There are several other such scripts available, but I&#x27;ve tried to make mine as simple to understand (I&#x27;m not a programmer) as possible (or as possible for me...). It currently works well for me but YMMV. Of course, I realize that there are a million ways to shave this yak, so I&#x27;d be curious if anyone has suggestions for improvement (though I&#x27;m also looking to keep things as simple as possible). I hope this might be of some use to people.

                    <span>Hello,
 Like I&#x27;ve written in another post about Omnisharp and LSP, I&#x27;m back to trying to use Emacs as my main GUI. This is for notes, coding, etc. The reason I want to use Emacs is that I haven&#x27;t found a good GUI for nvim for Windows and I sadly have to be on Windows for my daily work. This is where Emacs comes in. I&#x27;m setting up Emacs to be close to VIM (but not using SpaceMacs or DoomEmacs since they are incredibly slow on Windows, especially compared to &quot;Vanilla Emacs&quot;), with EVIL and some other helping functions. I have some beginner questions I&#x27;d love to get help with to be happy inside of Emacs. 
 1. How can I make my .emacs file a bit cleaner instead of doing this:
 (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;tree-sitter) (package-install &#x27;tree-sitter)) (unless (package-installed-p &#x27;smartparens) …</span>

                    <span>When I did my own research, I found that lsp-mode seemed to have eclipsed eglot and that it was close to the de facto LSP client for emacs. Recently, however, I have met quite a few developers that I respect who are using eglot and say that it is less buggy than lsp-mode.
 I have found that many of the bugs I have encountered while using emacs have been root caused to lsp-mode and lsp-ui. I am wondering if more experienced emacs users have an opinion on these two different packages (or sets of packages in the case of lsp-mode, dap-mode, lsp-ui). I am interested to hear about feature parity and stabability - and also using eglot when editing remote files with tramp.
 Also as an aside, it would be great to have an LSP client package added in the standard distribution of emacs.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m again (tried this before but ended up leaving this since I couldn&#x27;t get it working) trying to use Emacs as my &quot;IDE&quot;. I&#x27;m a evil user, but I don&#x27;t believe that has anything to do with my current problem. 
 I&#x27;m trying to get LSP working in emacs. Specifically Omnisharp with Unity3D. 
 I have installed lsp-mode and the Omnisharp server through the lsp-install command. When I look for the installed servers it also states that it is installed. However, when I try to use Emacs with my Unity project I get no auto-completion for anything related to Unity things (e.g. GameObject, Transform, etc.). I only get auto-completion for my own variables and such within my script. 
 I get this error message: 
 &quot;Warning (lsp-mode): Unable to calculate the languageId for buffer ‘acPlMovement.cs’. Take a look at ‘lsp-language-id-configuration’. The ‘major-mode’ is fundamental-mode&quot;
 It also says something about &quot;(Special LSP[Disconnected] company)&quot;. 
 I did read this page, but didn&#x27;t find that I should need any special setup for the omnisharp server. - https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/
 I assume I&#x27;m missing something in my setup, but I haven&#x27;t been able to google what I&#x27;m missing or what the problem could be. 
 Could anyone here help me with this? 
 Thanks in advance

                    <span>I find Haskell an amazing language but I have difficulties integrating it into my daily workflow. I work as a professional programmer and do Python all day long.
 I started the &quot;Learn you a Haskell&quot; book to tease my brain and learn to approach problems from a different angle. And I have learned a lot and I think my Python code has benefited from it.
 But I got stuck at the Monad chapter and lost interest. But it&#x27;s still in the back of my mind to get back to it.
 However, the biggest roadblock I am facing is that I can&#x27;t seem to find something useful to do with Haskell. Probably due to the lack of my knowledge/experience in that language.
 But I can&#x27;t bring myself to write Haskell at work as I would be the only one being able to maintain the code (no other Haskellers around).
 So I am turning to you folks: Do you have any ideas of writing something that will end up being something useful? Maybe some starters for implementing a HTTP/REST layer between a JS-Frontend and a database? Or something else I would love to play around with (but I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s even possible): Writing a Python extension in Haskell, or, if that&#x27;s not doable, a .so shared library which could be called from other code so I could use Python&#x27;s ctypes module (not sure if that is even possible either).
 Any ideas? Tips?

                    <span>Hey all. I&#x27;m a Haskell dev, but I use Kotlin in my day job. 
 For those not familiar, Jetpack Compose is a compiler plugin for Kotlin which allows for a declarative React/VDOM style of UI programming by composing so-called &quot;composable functions&quot; (which is funny to me as a Haskell dev, because what is a function if not composable?) to build up the UI.
 The kicker is, at compile-time, these composable functions are eliminated -- and (as I understand it) compiled to some imperative code that updates the UI appropriately in a reactive manner as it&#x27;s inputs change.
 Svelte works similarly, but for JavaScript.
 So in other words, you get something that looks a lot like a VDOM/React style UI -- but without the overhead of an actual VDOM!
 This is a fascinating idea to me, and I&#x27;d love to learn more about how such approaches work -- but at least in terms of compiler/DSL/PL-type features (basically anything that manipulates an AST), I find Haskell far easier to understand and read. So I was wondering if anyone has implemented anything similar in Haskell (or even a related language like Purescript).
 I know there&#x27;s gi-gtk-declarative and Halogen (on the Purescript side) -- and while these are both excellent libraries for declarative UI programming, as far as I know, both of them are implemented via a VDOM -- not with a compilation step.
 Does anyone know of anyone who&#x27;s attempted such a compile-time approach to declarative UIs in Haskell?

                    <span>Every year I use AoC in order to learn myself a new language, and this year I decided to land on Haskell.
 In order to have a nice user interface for myself, I used optparse-applicative in order to parse the following argument format: aoc --file  | --download .
 So far so good, but then I faced the following problem. The following snippet, which should work, returns a 400 error code and indicates that my access failed:
 readFromUrl :: String -&gt; IO String readFromUrl session -&gt; do now &lt;- getCurrentTime let expires &#x3D; addUTCTime (days 30) now cookie &#x3D; Cookie &quot;session&quot; session expires &quot;.adventofcode.com&quot; &quot;/&quot; now now False False True True jar &#x3D; createCookieJar [cookie] opts &#x3D; defaults &amp; cookies ?~ jar response &lt;- getWith opts &quot;https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/input&quot; return $ Char8.unpack $ response ^. responseBody 
 I am kind of in a loss about why this doesn&#x27;t work, and the internet or documentation doesn&#x27;t seem to give me a clue about why (or what part of) my way is wrong. Could youp lease point me in the direction of a documentation that would help me?

                    <span>Excuse me, I don&#x27;t have any experience with Haskell, but I have experience with Scala and ZIO.
 Recently, there was a discussion about functional programming, and I wanted to know how I do that differs from Haskell&#x27;s.

                    <span>Is there a way to set this variable in the properties or options of the file header?
 I know I can set it in file-local variables, with:
 # -*- mode: org; org-confirm-babel-evaluate: nil -*- 
 Or in a .dir-locals.el. However, when opening the file, I get prompted whether to allow setting the variable, which I don&#x27;t want. If I press ! at that prompt, to allow setting it in the future, too, it allows any file to set the variable without prompting, not just the one I opened (or others in the dame directory).
 Is there some way to set this in the file&#x27;s Org headers instead?

                    <span>Hi everyone!
I’ve been lurking for a while now but thought it was time to post and say hello. I’m a PhD student in Archaeology, and I stumbled upon the world of Zettelkasten while trying to find a better way to make notes at the start of my PhD.
I’ve jumped around quite a few different tools over the past year but there’s always been something that’s got in the way - apps were either too bloated or complicated or too buggy, or in some cases had awful font rendering.
My most recent favourite was iA Writer, and I think I was so attracted to it because I’ve learnt that I want something simple, minimal and distraction free.
For me, most options people seem to be using have too many bells and whistles and I want something that just gets out the way and leaves me with my text. iA Writer fit this bill perfectly but I found moving between notes and linking too cumbersome.
SO I’ve purchased The Archive this week and I absolutely love it! Just as minimal and “clean” but with ease of navigation built in.
I’m still in the process of getting familiar with The Archive but it seems to do everything I want it to. Before I was using subfolders but I’m thinking that I’m happy to lean in and just put all my notes in a single folder, and use tools like structure notes and other forms of hypertext to maintain connections and groupings where necessary.
The only thing I’m currently unsure of is how much to keep in my Zettelkasten. For example, my primary use case is academic writing, but I also want to keep notes relating to more personal topics of interest, e.g. notes about personal development, note taking, language-learning, etc. I’m not sure whether to combine everything or whether to keep my other interests separate.
Anyways, looking forward to learning more from you all and getting to grips with the method and The Archive in greater depth. Thanks for all the wisdom I’ve already gained from the forums!</span>

                    <span>if you build a v28 or v29 emacs using &quot;--with-native-compilation&quot;, and you load an elisp library, it is magically compiled &amp; hot-loaded into your editor (which i find *amazing*). but what about the elisp that is loaded into temacs before dumping?

                    <span>Hi, 
 I have been trying to get lsp-julia to work for a couple of days now. No go. I there anyone who has been able to make it work with the latest julia (1.7), languageserver and symbolserver installed?
 It cannot index the files. It starts up, and then crashes. I thought this is just because julia first-run is so slow. I tried vscode and lo and behold, the language server spun up instantly :( 
 Any help/tips/suggestions?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to emacs and lots of the terminology and understanding for it is nooby.
 I was wondering if someone could in baby terms guide me how I can do the following:
 ​
 a) Write and save a text file
 b) Open an application
 c) Open a .mp3
 d) Open a folder
 e) Set a macro on my keyboard to open a specified application
 ​
 Thank-you in advance

                    <span>I&#x27;d like the grep buffer not to scroll/move the current line to the top of the buffer/screen when i press enter. I&#x27;ve tracked the issue down to &#x60;compile-goto-error&#x60; and then &#x60;next-error-internal&#x60; in simple.el, but I can&#x27;t seem to find the relevant code. I&#x27;ve tried a few configuration options, including &#x60;next-error-recenter&#x60; (which seems to just stop recentering/scrolling on the destination buffer) but can&#x27;t seem to figure it out.
 Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>I have been mostly happy keeping no emacs custom-file using Drew Adams&#x27; cus-edit+. This means that all my customization is kept in my use-package statements, so it is fully reproducible. The only downside in my year+ of doing this has been that sometimes I get warnings or &quot;buttons&quot; in messages that pop up, such as &quot;disable showing&quot; in a pop-up warning, and I don&#x27;t know how to &quot;disable&quot; it permanently. Normally it would put a line into my custom file and I could use that to update my :custom sections in my init.el. Now, though, it saves it in running &quot;state&quot; if I click the (eg) &quot;Disable showing&quot; button, but I have no idea what I should write to make it permanently remember not to show that thing.
 Any solutions? How can maintain no custom file, but still capture the code that would be written by interface interactions like errors &quot;disable showing&quot;, or certain customizer settings, etc?

                    <span>Hi, I was recently playin with the docker package from this page - https://github.com/Silex/docker.el Which I think is using docker tramp. But i am unable to work around a very annoying problem. When i try to trigger the exec command, it constantly throws a warning or error. Attached shots below. I am quite confused and was unable to find any solution online, actually noone seems to have had this problem ?

 docker exec -it keycloak sh &amp;&amp; extit || exit the input device is not a TTy. If you are using mintty try prefixing the command with &#x60;winpty&#x60; helm-M-x-execute-command: Tramp failed to connect. If this happens repeatedly, try &#x60;M-x tramp-cleanup-this-connection&#x60;

                    <span>having trouble with org-journal and org-agenda - 
 I configured org-journal-carryover-items to carry over all except those marked DONE . This carryover happens at file-creation time for the next day. 
 If I schedule something in an org-journal entry for a date in the future, the file is created. But there are no carryover items at the time. 
 When items do carry over, the file is already created, so they don’t get added to the existing file.
 ​
 How do I fix this?
 ​
 Doom emacs

 I use Conan package manager for manage my external libraries which locate in &#x60;~/.conan/data&#x60;. I am currently using Spacesmacs and wonder how I can add that folder to to syntax checking. I added this hook to the user-config:
 (add-hook &#x27;c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq flycheck-clang-include-path (list (expand-file-name &quot;~/.conan/data/&quot;))))) 
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to work... Can you advice me how to include certain dir to path?
 Also I use &#x60;lsp-clangd&#x60; backend.. Maybe something to be set there?

 Is there a way to configure notmuch to have this gnus functionality?

 Per the documentation for format-time-string that says that %n is a newline, I tried adding %n to org-agenda-format-date-aligned as well as to org-super-agenda-date-format, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick. Any ideas? Much appreciated!

                    <span>You&#x27;ve almost certainly all heard this sentence before. As a new Emacs user and someone who does want to really get to know Emacs, I want to hear about all the pros and cons I have heard so far, from you guys. I&#x27;m really surprised how friendly this community is. I&#x27;ve never seen a more friendly online group ever. 
 I am the guy that asked about &quot;Emacs-Lisp functions beneath the surface&quot; a few days ago. 
 Anyway, I was watching this video and there is something that caught my attention more than anything else. And that is the sentence at 14:00 : 
  
&quot; Emacs is 12 MB, core with none of the Lisp extensions.&quot; 
  
Is this really true? Why is Emacs considered a bloat Software, in some communities, then? 12 MB doesn&#x27;t seem much. 
 And what do people mean when they say that Emacs is bloat or memory intensive? Is the core bloated?
 There are definitely people that are more for debating than actually addressing problems or having a discussion. So I&#x27;m really curious, is it that there is actually a real reason they are saying it, or is it just that it&#x27;s a common &quot;saying&quot; of Vim users and users who find Emacs &quot;too difficult&quot;? 
 Or is it that an average user uses so many packages that Emacs becomes CPU and/or memory intensive? 
 What do you consider a bloat software?
 Also, even the guy in the video said that at 18:20: 
  
&quot;All these things that people have said about Emacs having a big footprint and being memory intensive blah blah blah it&#x27;s all true&quot; 
  
I would love to hear your perspective on this commonly brought up &quot;contention&quot;.

                    <span>Hi there. I&#x27;m a recent Emacs convert using Spacemacs. I was wondering if anyone else is using Emacs to write Python 3.10 code, specifically using the new match and case keywords. When I try to use them, Emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize them as keywords, and so doesn&#x27;t understand that it should indent the following lines.
 If I understand correctly, this is handled by python.el. Has there been any movement on adding support for the new keywords? And where could I go to find out, follow progress, or possibly contribute?
 For reference, I&#x27;m using Emacs 27.2 and the built-in python.el. Thank you!

                    <span>I find Emacs&#x27; scroll down C-v and up M-v a little jarring. I duckduckgoed (went?) around and found golden-ratio-scroll-screen but it didn&#x27;t scroll 62% of the screen, as the README claims it to do -- in fact it overshot by a bit. As I don&#x27;t have the time to debug it right now, what recommendations do you have to scroll half a page up or down on Emacs?

                    <span>My ultimate goal is to parse function and class/type signatures and add comment documentation stubs, think doxygen. I am starting with Python and hopefully implement it for other languages when I successfully implement this. The parser part is easy, but the problem is that most of the file is not relevant and I want to ignore it. Is there way to jump to the part of the file/text that is potentially parseable or is relevant to the task.
  There is some text that I don&#x27;t care about... ...  ... Maybe more irrelevant text. 
 I tried using getPosition and setPosition but it didn&#x27;t behave like I expected, maybe I am using them wrong?
 Any advice would be appreciated.
  
EDIT: I am using parsec for parsing.

                    <span>I know this code is garbage, but basically I&#x27;m trying to implement a safe (maybe) Int division function. I have to use both recursion &amp; guards, so this is what I came up with. The problem now is that somehow the just (negate count) in the test&#x27; function doesn&#x27;t work (it always returns the result as positive, eg dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; (-100) 10 is always Just 10) - and I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why. I checked that the test&#x27; function does indeed get called, I triple checked my guards etc. Any help would be much appreciated :)
 dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Maybe Int dividedBy&#x27;&#x27; num denom | denom &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 &#x3D; Nothing | num  0 &#x3D; test&#x27; (negate num) denom 0 | num &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; denom  0 &amp;&amp; denom &gt; 0 &#x3D; go num denom 0 where go n d count | n &lt; d &#x3D; Just count | otherwise &#x3D; go (n - d) d (count + 1) test&#x27; n d count | n &lt; d &#x3D; Just (negate count) -- why does this not work?? ffs | otherwise &#x3D; go (n - d) d (count + 1)

                    <span>A question about ghcup. I&#x27;ve used that to install a recent version of GHC (9.0.1), alongside the one from the Ubuntu repos (8.8.something). Ghcup also installed Cabal 3.6 for me.
 How do I persude my OS and/or Cabal to use the version of GHC installed by ghcup, and not one from Ubuntu? 
 I resorted to added some manual links into ~/.ghcup/bin, pointing to the GHC binaries I want, but that can&#x27;t be the way to do it properly.

                    <span>Dear all
 We are thrilled to announce the release of Ogma, a new open-source NASA tool, written in Haskell, to generate hard-realtime C runtime monitoring applications from high-level specifications.
 Ogma takes the output of existing tools, like NASA&#x27;s requirements elicitation tool FRET [2], and produces monitors in Copilot [3], a runtime verification language that can be compiled to hard-realtime C99.
 Ogma is also able to produce monitoring applications for NASA&#x27;s Core Flight System (cFS), which can be compiled alongside existing applications to flag requirement violations. 
 FRET requirement being monitored inside the XPlane flight simulator by taking the code generated by Ogma and making it accessible to the simualtor via a custom on-screen plugin
 Ogma takes high-level specifications produced from requirements by NASA&#x27;s FRET tool and converts them into Copilot runtime monitors that can be converted into hard-realtime C99 code.
 This is research software (Class E) and it has not been certified for use in aircraft or UAVs. We are currently using it for upcoming experiments at NASA Langley.
 We&#x27;d like to also take this opportunity to publicly thank the team that creates BNFC, for their tool, their response to technical questions during the development of Ogma, and for accommodations made to help us speed up our release process.
 If you have any issues, feel free to open a ticket in the github repo directly.
 Happy haskelling,

                    <span>I re-registered for a masters of CS program because my BCS was completed at a relatively unknown Canadian school so I am always wondering if &quot;I know less&quot; than others in important areas like distributed computing on which I have almost no knowledge. I know the masters program uses languages like C, C++, Java, Python, etc so I&#x27;m wondering how much of a gap I&#x27;ll be left with to transfer the knowledge I gain to implementing in Haskell. Is there a better roadmap to learning more advanced topics and applying them in Haskell or other pure functional languages than enrolling in a masters program? It&#x27;s fully online so courses only, no thesis. Should I get a job doing something within reach and self-study these concepts and trying to implement in Haskell? I&#x27;m still a novice in Hasekll but feel as though I&#x27;m falling behind already as the trend towards pure functional languages seems to be accelerating. Should I try to enroll in a graduate program that is focused on functional languages like the one at Tsukuba University?

                    <span>One of the biggest problem is the difficulty using programming tool on the code, because the code is wrapped in org file, programming tools can&#x27;t access to code.
 In order to integrate org babel code to programming tools ecosystem. 2 possible solutions: - import/export solution, like myuhe/org-gcal.el. For instance, we compile org file to .java, and recompile .java to .org. But this solution has a lot of drawbacks. When recompile .java to .org, a new org file is generated by the compiler, we lose the data organization, and all the info that are not exported of original org file. - bi-directional synchronisation solution like dengste/org-caldav. For instance, only code block of org file is exported to .java file, and all modification on java file will repercut on org code block. This is the best solution for the problem.
 However, I don&#x27;t see either of the 2 solutions used in the org mode literary programming tutorials. But they are used to integrate org agenda to another calendar ecosystem. Is there a reason?

                    <span>I&#x27;m using the new org-cite engine to write my dissertation. It works well except that when exporting to ODT or even Org-mode with chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl as the CSL style I get a reference without date. So for citation [cite:@fabianTimeOtherHow2014 p. 7;] I get:
 For ODT 
  
[1]Johannes Fabian, Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7
  
for Org-mode
  
[fn::Johannes Fabian, /Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object/ (Columbia University Press, n.d.), 7]
  
As you can see, in both cases the date is missing. As per this reply to this issue on citeproc-org&#x27;s Github it seems that the date field is not a recognized bibtex field. If I change manually in my .bib file a particular entry from date to year then I do get the correct reference.
 My question is: how can I solve this issue without changing the date field of all the entries in my .bib file to year?
 This is what I have at the top of my org file:
 #+CSL_STYLE: ~/Zotero/styles/chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: /Users/name/Documents/dissertation/zotero_full.bib

                    <span>I read https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/conversions.html and I&#x27;m left with some questions. In Scala 2, we create a companion object, e.g.,
 object Fraction { def IntToFraction(n: Int): Fraction &#x3D; Fraction(n) } class Fraction(numer: Int, demon: Int &#x3D; 1) { private val gcd &#x3D; // TODO: Calculate GCD(numer, denom) val numerator &#x3D; numer / gcd val denominator &#x3D; denom / gcd def apply def +(addend:Fraction) // etc. } 
 Is a companion object unnecessary in Scala 3?
 I could just try it on my other computer as I have Scala 3 on that one, but I would still appreciate some pointers on this.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m a Java and Groovy dev and I picked a Scala2/Spark position for my next job as I was very attracted to all I heard about the language. I figured it would be a great way for me to generally become a better programmer, fast.
 Now though, I need to kick things into high gear. I have roughly three months of afterwork evenings and weekends to really get going with Scala before I have to code in front of my peers.
 Would any of you have pointers as to where to start? Books, online lectures, exercise websites? I&#x27;ll take anything!
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I am the guy wants to be a professional programmer of scala and I really hope that many people use scala. I know scala came out with a like motto that covers both oop and fp paradigm. Yeap functional programming is really good and that is the target to achieve to scala learners. Functional programming style sounds good. So can all of you know zio? Except for beginners anyone who like functional programming style have to know zio. Why? This library is main stream these days. Many people really like zio. I agree zio is a great library. So what? If you decided you became a scala programmer you have to learn elementary grammar and functional programming style and library like zio. Why does the guy wants to use scala like me have to know all of those? Is this language for someone who is smart and for elite?

                    <span>I have a method A calling method B.
 A { Try{ calling B } match { case Success(_) ... case Failure(e) ... }
 B is returning Failure (exception) like
 def B: Try[Unit] &#x3D;&gt; { Failure(exception) }
 This is going inside the Success block of A, any idea why?

                    <span>Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what’s going on in its community.

Assessing Haskell by Nyeogmi
I considered trying to assess Haskell without mentioning my own opinions at all. I don’t think that’s fair or possible, nor do I think that would lead people to an accurate assessment of Haskell.
Fallback of actions by Magnus Therning
In a tool I’m writing I want to load a file that may reside on the local disk, but if it isn’t there I want to fetch it from the web. Basically it’s very similar to having a cache and dealing with a miss, except in my case I don’t populate the cache.

 (possible to mirror some github repos onto local git server).

                    <span>Evaluating (window-text-width) for a fullscreen window returns 238, which indicates that 238 columns of characters should be able to be displayed on one line. However, using count-words-region, I can see that I can actually only fit 234 characters on a line without it causing wrapping (I&#x27;m using global-visual-line-mode, although this problem persists when it&#x27;s off). This causes problems with any functionality that tries to right align content - for instance, org-agenda will try to align content so that the last character in a heading&#x27;s tags is on column 238 (i.e. on the right side of the screen), but since column 238 is actually beyond the right side of the screen, the tags end up on the following visual line. Instead of
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 I end up with
 * TODO my task a :@home: * TODO my task b :@work: 
 ...which is significantly less information dense and generally uglier. I was content to set org-agenda-tags-column to 0, but I&#x27;ve recently picked up ledger, and this issue has also started messing up the formatting in its reports. This also happens regardless of how I split windows - if I split vertically, window-text-width reports a width of 118, but I can actually only fit 114 columns. Has anyone run into this before, or have tips for where to start looking? This seems like such a finicky, low-level thing I don&#x27;t have much hope - especially since I haven&#x27;t futzed around with any obvious culprits like font settings.

                    <span>Hi, On my work ( windows)laptop. Due to needing service desk to install most software. I find it easier just ssh’ing into a Linux cloud vm in that this allows me to install whatever I need. So thats good but then I’m in emacs (spacemacs ) terminal not GUI. 
 The reason I ask is that terminal only , there are problems displaying graphics e.g. matplotlib plots. So my workaround for this is Jupyter lab: jupyter lab --ip&#x3D;0.0.0.0 --port&#x3D;9090. My question is… is there any way to view plots in emacs given my setup? I’d prefer to have freedom to use emacs org mode and render plots than be forced to use Jupiter lab notebooks .
 Does anybody know, if possible, how I can display images in emacs using cloud vm?
 Thanks

                    <span>I am unable to successfully utilize the pdf-tools package.
 Environment:
  
macOS Monterey 12.0.1
 Emacs 27.2
  
To the best of my understanding, I have followed the installation instructions as outline on https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools:
  
I&#x27;ve installed and confirmed that the installations of poppler and automak are up-to-date
 Though it doesn&#x27;t seem to be required for the MacOS install, I&#x27;ve installed and confirmed that the installations of gcc and glib are up-to-date.
 I&#x27;ve set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH in the init.el file using setenv and confirmed its settings using getenv
  
​
 (setenv &quot;PKG_CONFIG_PATH&quot; &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.8/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig&quot;) 
 When I try to execute pdf-tools-install and select y in response to the question &quot;Need to (re)build the epdfinfo program, do it now?&quot; I get a compilation error which reads:
 ​

 To build project I run : sudo docker .... make -f Makefile.custom
 Can I use that flycheck or any other code checker to see my mistakes while coding?

 I use some commands that have a habit of splitting my windows, like magit or C-x p s to open a shell. I find this annoying and would prefer the default behaviour to open the command in the currently active window instead.
 Does anyone know how to do that?

                    <span>New emacs user here, I&#x27;m having trouble with color themes. I use M-x to install via package-installer and M-x to load theme. 
 Spacemacs dark and light look fine but everything else results in some weird mixing of themes:

 https://i.postimg.cc/FRRfrjLM/Screen-Shot-2021-12-02-at-1-16-38-AM.png
 What is the proper procedure to install themes? A post on stackoverflow mentions the need to disable themes before applying a new theme. Trying this sometimes works and sometimes does not. It does change the mixing but there is still mixing
 A similar thing happens when I tried to use powerline smart mode line.
 Here&#x27;s my init.el. Running emacs 27.2 (9.0) on MacOS Catalina 10.15.4

 All I have added is the Melpa package installer snippet. Any help is much appreciated!

 I ran across context.vim https://github.com/wellle/context.vim, which is basically a sticky header, where your cursor is.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anybody knows, if there is a package for Emacs as well, which has the same, or similar behavior.

 I want to put a condition in my .emacs to check if it is xwidget compiled emacs, I want to use a certain package like mu4e-views. Otherwise, I want to skip it.

                    <span>So i have been researching Cardano for a few months and was curious about the haskell programming that it uses for Dapps.
 What do you think about Cardano using haskell programming?
 What do you think about Cardano the project itself?
 Any intresting projects you working on?
 Thanks for the read!

                    <span>Given this program, main.hs  import System.IO main :: IO () main &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [getLine] head xs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn head xs &gt;&gt;&#x3D; putStrLn  I was surprised to find this output:
  echo -e &quot;1\n2&quot; | runghc main.hs 2&gt;/dev/null 1 2  (instead of 1\n1\n).
 Does this happen because IO String is a monad around a reader handle (stdin in this case), and so multiple binds on the same value cause successive reads on the handle?

                    <span>What to call these? Patterns like Ap themselves follow a meta-pattern which specifies applicative lifting where the operations all have the form opn &#x3D; liftAn opn.. give or take lifting constants. Assume simplified classes and liftA0 &#x3D; pure
 instance (Applicative f, Semigroup a) &#x3D;&gt; Semigroup (Ap f a) where () &#x3D; liftA2 () instance (Applicative f, Monoid a) &#x3D;&gt; Monoid (Ap f a) where mempty &#x3D; liftA0 mempty instance (Applicative f, Bounded a) &#x3D;&gt; Bounded (Ap f a) where minBound &#x3D; liftA0 minBound maxBound &#x3D; liftA0 maxBound instance (Applicative f, Num a) &#x3D;&gt; Num (Ap f a) where (+) &#x3D; liftA2 (+) (-) &#x3D; liftA2 (-) (*) &#x3D; liftA2 (*) abs &#x3D; liftA abs .. fromInteger &#x3D; liftA0 . fromInteger 
 The pattern is somewhat simple but with no way to capture it, except by repeating it for every algebra. The instance head cannot be a type variable
 instance (Applicative f, cls a) &#x3D;&gt; cls (Ap f a) where ?? 
 What would such a solution even look like? I don&#x27;t want to get distracted by if the instance are all lawful, just capturing this meta-pattern the emerges. 
  
A generic representation for type classes to parallel Generic for datatypes. 
 It can be implemented as a GHC plugin, like Evoke (blog, reddit, reddit)
 
Or created on the fly by GHC, which is privy to the internal structure of type classes
 instance (Applicative f, cls a) &#x3D;&gt; cls (Stocking1 Ap f a)

 I maneged to download all the other extension he was asking for but can&#x27;t download the language server. In the VS&#x27;s marketplace it is literally just not there. What can I do?

 so I tried putting &#x60;or&#x60; there instead but I just get another error.
 Am I missing an import?
 At the top of my file I have
 import Data.List import qualified Data.Map as M import Data.Maybe 
 and I swear I have been following the book line by line so did not miss any other imports.

                    <span>Morning org-fans,
 I have been asked for the PDF of my org-reveal presentation.
 I&#x27;m aware I can use the:
 ?print-pdf 
 and
 Ctrl+P 
 Method in my browser to generate a PDF, but that doesn&#x27;t do what I need.
 It doesn&#x27;t retain the formatting of the presentation. It simply displays a small amount of black text on a white blank page. This looks unprofessional and is hard to read.
 Am I missing something obvious here?

                    <span>Hi all, is anyone using org-ql with a big number of files, probably in combination with org-roam, instead of say deft? How well does it scale to thousands of files? I know that org-agenda can get pretty sluggish around a thousand files, but it&#x27;s my understanding that org-ql is faster, although maybe not that faster. Any experience? Thanks!
 NOTE: this is not for TODOs but for general search, I&#x27;ve seen workarounds that exclude files not containing tasks nor projects from the search, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m interested in, I want to search every file and ideally using more structured queries like those of org-ql (vs deft).
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve been experimenting a bit with this:
  
I cloned this big nonsense ZK which is designed to stress-test note-taking apps.
 I converted all notes from md to org using pandoc: for f in *; do pandoc --to org &quot;$f&quot; &gt; &quot;${f%%.md}.org&quot;; done. Not really necessary for what it follows, except for the file extension part, but anyway.
 Now, searching for some text with ripgrep is very fast, as expected, for example with 56/10000 matches:
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
time rg -c &quot;to queer noises&quot; *.org | wc -l 56
  
real 0m0.317s user 0m0.195s sys 0m0.316s &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
Now with org-ql the same search setting org-directory to be the ZK folder, requiring no grouping and just random order, and doing a (regexp &quot;to queer noises&quot;) freezes, at least I&#x27;ve been waiting for minutes now for it to end. Repeating the search in a subset of that ZK with just a few hundred notes, it ends after some seconds, but it&#x27;s still borderline usable.
  
So I guess the answer is a sound NO, org-ql can&#x27;t be reasonably used in a setup like this one. u/github-alphapapa do you have any objection to my methodology here? Thanks!
 EDIT: deft has also been terribly sluggish with this same ZK, both in generating the deft buffer and in searching through it, so the best option seems to be something like consult-ripgrep.

                    <span>So most of my work, I have used hell lot of JavaScript and Python and a littlebit of TypeScript. In my new Job, I am supposed to learn Scala and I already had a hard time understanding Generics and all such concepts. Additionally the functional way of Scala, stuff like accumulator based recursion and tail recursion, lazy variables also got my head spinning.
 I am planning to Dive even deeper into this but I wanted to know from all of you that should I rather go and learn Java or TypeScript in depth before going to Scala? Actually I don&#x27;t have a lot of time grasping all of the concepts and so I began with basics of Scala and till now my experience is neither too good nor too bad.
 ​
 As of 2021 (or we can say almost 2022), what would be your advise for a beginer with statically typed language and how should I go about learning Scala so that I get a good grip in it?
 ​
 Additionally, when we say Java there are two things: 1. Pure Programming Side of Java, 2. JVM and of-course here I am not referring to the JVM side as I understand, since Scala anyways runs on JVM, that&#x27;s a necessary thing. What I need to know is that do you need to go through Java Programming or any such language before getting Scala really well?

                    <span>Although the feature is still marked as experimental, the release of Nix 2.4 marks the entry of content-addressed derivations in a released Nix version.
This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you haven’t done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), …</span>

                    <span>For those using emacs, this will mimic an interesting Scrivener feature. The Keyboard Maestro macro will change the desktop image from a list and, if Emacs is running at the front, it will (optionally) also set a corresponding theme at your choice.
You can configure the list using the following format:
Full path:Some description:spacemacs-theme

The image above displays text in olivetti-mode, using the great iA Writer Duospace font.
And this is the macro (I bind it to ^⌘J D):

If you need to Hide/Show Desktop Icons, you may use this script:
try
    set CurSet to do shell script &quot;defaults read com.apple.finder CreateDesktop&quot;
    on error
    set CurSet to &quot;1&quot;
 end try
 if CurSet is &quot;1&quot; then
    set NewSet to false
else
    set NewSet to true
end if
do shell script &quot;defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool &quot; &amp; NewSet
tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
    quit
    try
        activate
    end try

What do you do when your Zettelkasten is a mess ? I started building a Zettelkasten in Obisidan  a couple of months ago and finally ended up with a confusing web of notes.
Do you start from scratch, or do you continue with what you have, while refining your approach to Luhmann&#x27;s method ?</span>

Zettel Crafting Checklist v.3
If surgeons and airline pilots can benefit from checklists, they probably will help me. 1
It is essential to keep any formal checklist flexible and straightforward. 
There is a difference between the structure of a zettel and its content. A checklist supports the completion of the physical form of the zettel. A checklist can only provide prompts to complete the knowledge assimilation. This knowledge assimilation comes from contextual deep thinking that focuses on the second-order meanings exposed by the idea in the zettel.
My idea of a zettel-making-checklist is that it focuses on the structure, thereby freeing up cognitive cycles so I can focus on the zettel content. And heaven knows I need all the cognitive cycles I can muster.
New Note Checklist
YAML Frontmatter [[202003231450]]
Body
Actual zettel (may include one or more of the following)
Argument
Counterarguments
Factual claim
Reference (to other text)
Quotation (only the pithiest)
Metaphor (a figurative comparison)
Summary of idea
Definition
Question posed by the author
Questioning the author
An idea #2do
Mentally elaborate on the concept. Elaborate on both the text you are reading and on your understanding. Use these elaborations as the search query for exploring the zettelkasten and not just the keywords and phrases in the body of the text. You&#x27;ll be rewarded with connections that sparkle, these connections are the macronutrients of knowledge.
[ ] Connect to an existing structure note or make this the first zettel connection in a new structure note?

                    <span>Here is a screenshot of two editor windows, the left shows padding on the left and the right. The lines in this window will resize appropriately when the window is resized. On the right shows the same note open in the same sized window and there is no padding on the right. Some of the letters/words are cut off. They remain cut off when resizing the window until the window size can accommodate the &quot;Line width&quot; setting.

Steps to reproduce.</span>

 Stumbled upon interesting blog post about avy with examples / screenshots. Thought it will be useful to some of your guys.
 Link to article.
 tldr:
 To perform task we 1 Filter &gt; 2 Select &gt; 3 Act
 The stated purpose of Avy, jumping to things, makes it sound like a (contextually) faster Isearch. But jumping is only one of many possibilities. Avy&#x27;s &quot;Act&quot; part (“dispatch list”, a collection of actions you can perform on a candidate) is where it truly shines.

                    <span>Curious about people&#x27;s use of Org agenda. I initially was really enamored by the idea of using one system for notes, writing, and task, time, and project management, but found Org-agenda a bit too clunky and requiring too much thinking about how to set it up rather than using it. 
 I&#x27;m interested in developing some more Org-centric apps in the future, and was wondering whether a note-focused Org app would be used at all if people heavily relied on TODOs and such sprinkled within their notes. Personally I think a separate application (possibly also utilizing Org-mode) for such things would be better, but that&#x27;s just me!
 Let me know your workflows!

                    <span>I just randomly did &quot;M-x notes&quot; and the auto completes showed something called org-add-notes! I thought this is something similar to remember-notes, and immediately decided to write a note using this. I did that a few more times and stored them with C-c C-c.
 Now the problem is I don&#x27;t know where to get them! Where are they stored? I have not set this up in any way in my init.el. I didn&#x27;t even know about the existence of this command a few minutes ago.
 The documentation of this command does not give me any hints. Also, directly searching through org-mode info command index does not give anything. I can see the code for this in org.el but I am not a pro in elisp code reading and cannot figure out where exactly my notes are being saved.
 I do have the feeling from the code that this is actually not similar to remember-notes but perhaps has something to do with adding comments/notes to any org file item... but I may have understood wrong.

                    <span>Hello All *** TL:DR my experience*** I have been a part time emacs user for a decade now, with only 2/3 packages + maybe 30 lines of configuration added over the years.
 Lately i have been furstrated my my c++ IDE at work. I tried rtags a few years back but it crashed frequently. When checking the state of things recently I noticed LSP was getting big so I decided to give it a try to switch full time. I installed a few more packages like lsp, helm (love it). I even read the beginner&#x27;s elisp intro to understand its syntax.
 That&#x27;s when the rabbit hole started and i read about spacemacs and doom emacs
 *** doom/spacemacs : an overwhelming layer *** I get the reason for those distributions : having a curated set of packages preconfigured to work together + load time optimisations for an out of the box working experience. (+vim like experience for those who like it) 
 My issue was that after installing i did not know where to start. These 100+ packages must be worth learning right ? I expected a kind of interactive walkthrough like emacs&#x27;s own tutorial but ended up on the web documentation instead, which was also overwhelming.
 I wonder how people who have never used emacs/vim can get started easily on this. Do they use only 1% of the available features ? Is there a master tutorial somewhere that i missed ? 
 And for people who like tinkering/debugging with their config to have exactly what they want, i find it much easier on a minimalistic example than when 100+ plugins are involved.
 ** who are those distributions for ? *** I have the feeling that beginners would be better off with a simple config with discoverability improvements like which-key/helm
 And for seasoned user who like tinkering with the defaults, i find that building your config helps you understand how to use the plugin you&#x27;re using
 So fellow doom/space users, what made you jump on that train ? How did you get to &quot;master&quot; this complex environment ? 
 Cheers

                    <span>Hi,
 I recently discovered power of literate devops concept and for many cases it works great but I have problem with completion if I am connected to remote server over SSH (but not TRAMP but in Org babel session).
 E.g.:
 #+begin_src sh :session server ssh server1 #+end_src 
 C-c C-c to evaluate code block to establish SSH connection with server1 creates a shell buffer with the same name. Now C-x b, switch to that buffer in shell major mode and bash completion doesn&#x27;t work properly. It means if I want to cd /etc/ and the press TAB twice it doesn&#x27;t prompts content of /etc directory of my remote machine but my local. If I want correct completion of remote shell I have to use TRAMP session. Does anyone fix that problem and found workaround? Babel shell sessions are more comfortable for me.

                    <span>I think I have my terminology correct. I&#x27;m using Spacemacs but I don&#x27;t think that matters.
 When I invoke dired, helm wants to know which directory I want. It shows the current directory as a starting point. My question is how to edit this input. C-a takes me to the beginning of the line. C-S backspace clears the line, but how would I delete a word at a time? I&#x27;m currently backspacing a character at a time and that&#x27;s just annoying.

                    <span>Hi, I want to make two customizations to lsp-ui-imenu, when using python + pyright. First, running lsp-ui-imenu returns function names as well as all variables. I want it to return only function name so that I can jump to the top easily when using consult-imenu. I have looked into filtering this list in the source code but haven&#x27;t found how to do it. Second, is there a way for lsp-ui-imenu to show entries from the entire git-repo? It would be amazing if I could use this to jump between files, rather than having to first open the correct file then searching for the function name.
 Any help or pointers appreciated!

                    <span>Thought to write a post here before asking in the ivy github repo.
 I use ivy-switch-buffer bound to C-x b to switch to another buffer. Is it possible to assign numbers to the buffers so that pressing a number from the buffer list will automatically switch to that buffer? This will save a few keystrokes compared to moving up and down / fuzzy search for the buffer name and then press Enter.

I use Overleaf to write LaTeX documents online and even though I already selected in the menu of Overleaf to use Emacs keybindings, every time I press Ctrl+n Firefox or Chrome is opening a new browsing window, very annoying.
 Any workarounds on this?

                    <span>Ok, so, today I decided to learn abbrev. After wrestling a couple of minutes with the abbrev file because I&#x27;m using chemacs2, I finally defined an abbrev, and it worked. Well, kinda worked.
 It seems that if I type out the abbrev really quickly and press M-&#x27;, then it works, but inserts a dash after the needed expansion. If I type it out slowly, and then press M-&#x27;, it just places the dash after the thing that I need to expand. Then, if I quickly typed the thing and expanded it with M-&#x27;, I can expand it second time if I type it out and press C-x &#x27;. If I JUST type it out and press C-x &#x27;, nothing happens. I also tried doing it using hippie-expand, and it works, on the second time, printing &quot;Using try-expand-all-abbrevs&quot; in the echo area.
 I tried doing the same thing with completely clean emacs config (emacs -Q), and the results are the same. My version of emacs is 28.0.50. What am I doing wrong?

 It now works only with one private leaderboard, user ID and session ID must be set before running major mode.
 Things like global leaderboard, multiple private leaderboards, viewing tasks, fetching task inputs and posting results are planned.

                    <span>Hello, I have just started using lsp and i find it difficult to customize some aspects of it. One of it being lsp sideline, which quite annoyingly i cant force to hide from the buffer, but retain the option to still invoke the actions in the context of the curent symbol. 
 I wanted to disable the hideous wall of text next to the code that was showing actions and diagnostics, and simply use lsp-ui-sideline-apply-code-actions to see them in the minibuffer or a side display buffer/window. I was able to hide the text but not able to make list of available actions for a symbol show, with the config below, lsp-ui-sideline-apply-code-actions says - No code actions on the current line. While using lsp-execute-code-action shows the list of all actions not just the ones available for the symbol (in the context of the current symbol, while it works fine when lsp-ui-sideline-show-code-actions t) which is quite bad. I just can&#x27;t understand why there is no way to hide just the actions as text in the work buffer while retaining the ability to fetch the relevant actions on demand only. 
 lsp-ui-sideline-enable t lsp-ui-sideline-show-hover nil lsp-ui-sideline-show-symbol nil lsp-ui-sideline-show-diagnostics nil lsp-ui-sideline-show-code-actions nil

                    <span>I hear only good things about Rust from Haskell related social media places I follow, including this subreddit.
 I&#x27;ve been curious how Haskell devs write Rust code. Do they try to make Rust look &amp; feel more like Haskell by using certain libraries? How do they cope with lack of monads, type classes, HKTs and such?
 Edit Additional question(s): - How do you handle effects? The imperative way?

                    <span>I followed the discussion in a recent thread about people handling effects in Haskell. Many people seem to rely on a combination of some environment and IO, in one way or another (RIO, ReaderT env IO, IO + explicitly passing some environment, Handle Pattern, record-of-functions in the environment, ...).
 I am currently experimenting with a slightly different approach and I am quite happy with the results so far. More concretely, instead of combining an environment with IO, we can combine it with a continuation-based version of IO (aka ContT/Codensity/Managed) like ...
 newtype Program e a &#x3D; Program (e -&gt; forall b. (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; IO b) 
 ... with instances for Applicative, Functor, Monad, MonadIO, etc. One can read the type as &quot;a program running with an environment of type e and producing a…</span>

                    <span>Say we have a recursive data structure where the sub-trees are labeled by some functor f :
 ​
 data Tree f a &#x3D; Leaf a | Branch (f (Tree f a)) (f (Tree f a))
 ​
 What&#x27;s the name of the transformation that lets us relabel the branches using information from the respective whole subtree? by &quot;information&quot; I mean a summary, e.g. the result of a fold, and the signature of this transformation would be something like
 ​
 spork :: (...) &#x3D;&gt; Tree f a -&gt; Tree g a

                    <span>I can&#x27;t quite work out how to get polymorphic Has* typeclasses working. I think I&#x27;m missing something obvious.
 Starting with a non-polymorphic version
 data Child &#x3D; Child { _cVal1 :: !Bool , _cVal2 :: !Text } data Parent &#x3D; Parent { _pChild :: !Child , _pX :: !Int } data Env &#x3D; Env { _eParent :: !Parent , _eName :: !Text } class HasParent a where getParent :: a -&gt; Parent instance HasParent Env where getParent &#x3D; _eParent runTest :: forall env m. (MonadIO m, MonadReader env m, HasParent env) &#x3D;&gt; m () runTest &#x3D; do p &lt;- asks getParent print $ _pX p 
 runReaderT runTest env works as expected
 But if want to make Child polymorphic (Child m) then I can&#x27;t seem to get the types correct. I get close with type families, but not quite there. 
 Here is the full polymorphic test

                    <span>To me, this seems like an oversight, as it means that many potential compile-time errors become runtime errors instead. What is the justification for it? Are there plans to make missing methods an error by default?

 As a backup, is there any way to disable preview for undefined commands (i.e. show the LaTeX code), instead of just showing a blank?

                    <span>Hello. I&#x27;ve posted this on r/functionalprogramming. In short: I&#x27;m not smart enough for Haskell, so I&#x27;m looking for other alternatives where immutability and pure functions are, if not mandatory, at least encouraged.
 In just a few days I hopped to Elm, Ocaml, back to Typescript and, finally, there and back again to Javascript(is programming-language hopping a thing?), after this book got me excited to give it a try. After reaching to chapter 8 with a certain hopelessness regarding (lack of) types, I ended up to this article with quite strong arguments against using JS if you want strong typing and functional proogramming facilities (&quot;Functional programming. Types. JavaScript. Pick two&quot;). The article mentioned PureScript and here I am. From Haskell syntax to strong typing, the language seems to have everything I&#x27;m looking for mentioned right at its home page.
 While learning Haskell, I liked pretty much almost everything. I really, really liked its syntax, the ways we can define types and type classes, its simplicity, and I think it was relatively easy to learn that. What got me really overburdened was how to &quot;change states&quot; and IO. From that point of view, is there something along the way that disapoint me?
 EDIT: this is being helpful: https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Differences-from-Haskell.md

                    <span>Hi! I have the following, combining inline match and default argument:
 inline def func(myArg: (Int | String) &#x3D; 0) &#x3D; inline myArg match case i: Int &#x3D;&gt; () case s: String &#x3D;&gt; () 
 It works fine when called so that the default value is not used:
 // works fine func(1) 
 However, when the value is used, it fails to compile:
 // fails func() 
 with
 [error] |cannot reduce inline match with [error] | scrutinee: myArg$proxy1 : (myArg$proxy1 : (Int | String) @uncheckedVariance) [error] | patterns : case i @ _:Int [error] | case s @ _:String 
 Apparently the default value is a method that is not inlined. Is there a way around this?

                    <span>There is something i don&#x27;t understand, a difference between behavior of org-babel and org-mode when you use org table to pass data using or not using :var.
 #+NAME:mypythoncode #+begin_src python :results value raw :output :return tabulate(df, headers&#x3D;df.columns, tablefmt&#x3D;&#x27;orgtbl&#x27;) import numpy as np import pandas as pd from tabulate import tabulate df &#x3D; pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,10,size&#x3D;(10, 4)), columns&#x3D;list(&#x27;ABCD&#x27;)) #+end_src #+RESULTS: mypythoncode | | A | B | C | D | |---+---+---+---+---| | 0 | 0 | 9 | 6 | 0 | | 1 | 2 | 9 | 0 | 4 | | 2 | 9 | 6 | 0 | 1 | | 3 | 6 | 1 | 8 | 1 | | 4 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 4 | | 5 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 6 | 4 | 8 | 9 | 0 | | 7 | 1 | 4 | 8 | 7 | | 8 | 9 | 3 | 2 | 5 | | 9 | 5 | 0 | 7 | 3 | #+NAME:lib-R #+HEADER: :var code&#x3D;mypythoncode #+begin_src R :results output library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(lubridate) str(code) #+end_src #+RESULTS: lib-R : chr &quot;| | A | B | C | D |\n|----+-----+-----+-----+-----|\n| 0 | 8 | 0 | 5 | 2 |\n| 1 | 2 | &quot;| __truncated__ 
 As you see, the org table is not recognized as a dataframe by R. 
 If i replace by a basic org table : 
 ​
 #+NAME: any_data | | parameter | value | |---+-----------+-------| | 0 | heats | 30 | | 1 | heats | 30 | #+NAME:lib-R #+HEADER: :var code&#x3D;any_data #+begin_src R :results output library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(lubridate) str(code) #+end_src #+RESULTS: lib-R : &#x27;data.frame&#x27;: 2 obs. of 3 variables: : $ X : int 0 1 : $ parameter: chr &quot;heats&quot; &quot;heats&quot; : $ value : int 30 30 
 That works...
 Any help appreciated to understand how i will resolve that ...

                    <span>Hello to everyone. I have a little problem, I have used Neovim Coc while learning Javascript and I want to know is if there is a way for lsp-mode to behave like Coc. For example, when typing the next in Neovim:
 button.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, (e) &#x3D;&gt; { alert(&quot;THIS IS A BUTTON!!!!&quot;); e.target.style.background &#x3D; &quot;blue&quot;; }); 
 If I ask for completion for e.target.... in Coc, I get style option and background, etc. When I want to do this in lsp-mode in Emacs, I don&#x27;t get any candidate.
 Another example is if I select an HTML element by putting their class or id:
 let test &#x3D; document.querySelector(&quot;.this-is-a-class&quot;);
 let test2 &#x3D; document.querySelector(&quot;#this-is-an-id&quot;);
 when I ask for property completion in Coc for test and test2, I get candidates corresponding to the HTML element. In lsp-mode I don&#x27;t get any of these.
 I don&#x27;t know if Coc works like this or if lsp-mode doesn&#x27;t have this feature. Sorry but English is not my first language.

                    <span>Hi, I just followed the install instructions
 nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install cachix use emacs-osx nix-env -iA emacsOsxNative -f https://github.com/sagittaros/emacs-osx/archive/refs/tags/built.tar.gz 
 But the application frame is light and not using the system dark mode. Am I missing a flag or option? https://emacsformacos.com, railwaycat emacs-port and d12frosted/emacs-plus all support this.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to make a custom org-mode agenda view that shows not only all tasks in the waiting state, but also the message I entered when changing state. Relevant Lisp from init.el:
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands &#x27;((&quot;c&quot; &quot;My custom agenda&quot; ((todo &quot;WAITING|HOLD&quot; ((org-agenda-overriding-header &quot;Waiting and postponed tasks&quot;) (org-agenda-sorting-strategy &#x27;(category-keep))))))) org-log-into-drawers &quot;LOGBOOK&quot; org-todo-keywords &#x27;((sequence &quot;TODO(t)&quot; &quot;WORK(w)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;DONE(d)&quot;) (sequence &quot;HOLD(h@/!)&quot; &quot;WAITING(W@/!)&quot; &quot;|&quot; &quot;CANCELLED(c@/!)&quot;))) 
 Example snippet from job.org:
 * WAITING Replace failing 2TB drive in Wrath :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;WAITING&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2021-11-30 Tue 13:33] \\ Spare parts ordered :END: 
 How it looks now:
 Waiting and postponed tasks job: WAITING Replace failing 2TB drive in Wrath 
 What I want:
 Waiting and postponed tasks job: WAITING Replace failing 2TB drive in Wrath Spare parts ordered 
 Anyone done anything similar before, or have any pointers for how I can achieve something similar?

                    <span>Is there any mobile (iPhone) tool I can use to edit org files, specifically for todos and using a git remote (github, gitlab, etc.)? I&#x27;d like to be able to add a couple of todos to my todo file and immediately have them version controlled. It doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a way to do this through the Github app, and the app only renders org docs as plain text anyways.

                    <span>Hey guys! So I killed my mid-2011 MBA yesterday (sigh..RIP), and had to replace it asap with another MBA, so I now have an M1 running Big Sur. Don&#x27;t get me started on all of the things I hate about this..BUT, one of the things I am disliking intensely the most is that I can no longer just type &quot;emacs filename&quot; at the command line, and invoke plain old non-GUI emacs. I&#x27;ve installed the GUI emacs from emacsformacsosx, and I have an alias so I can invoke it by typing &quot;emacs filename&quot;, but of course it still invokes the efmo GUI version. I&#x27;m competent enough to sudo and follow clear step-by-step instructions (yeah, I&#x27;m one of those users that every sysadmin dreads..I know *just* enough to f everything up), but everything I&#x27;ve found assumes that you already have &#x27;brew&#x27; or some other one (I forget the name)...and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m stymied. Does anybody have pointers to step-by-step directions for getting regular emacs back on my computer? (There are a lot of sites that say &quot;emacs comes already installed but it&#x27;s not the best version&quot; but if that is true for Big Sur out of the box, for the life of me I can&#x27;t find it (lots of files with emacs in the name do turn up when I do a &#x27;locate&#x27; but none that seem to be actually executable).
 Thank you in advance!
 Annie

                    <span>Hi!
 First post here, long time emacs user, I hope I understood the rules correctly.
 I&#x27;m trying to use pkcs11 client authentication from within emacs (the new way if possible, i.e. without disabling the internal gnutls support).
 On the command line it&#x27;s possible to use client certificates from a hardware token via e.g --provider /usr/lib64/libeTPkcs11.so and by passing the appropriate strings for --x509certfile&#x3D; and --x509keyfile (obtained via p11tool).
 From https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html#Help-for-users I gather that it should be possible to set those strings in ~/.authinfo.gpg but I guess the only thing that&#x27;s missing would be the --provider switch. Any idea how to add that one?
 Thanks in advance for any kind of suggestion!

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been using emacs doom for 2 years coming from spacemacs, the only thing I&#x27;m missing from spacemacs is the SPC K R shortcut to access the kill-ring. The kill ring allows to access all killed strings of character like a clipboard which is very useful. Can you help me to achieve this on doom?
 EDITED: fixed the keybinding and add a quick description.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using vterm a lot, and really like entering vterm-copy-mode. However, sometimes (I haven&#x27;t figured out under what circumstances) the following sequence of commands leads to weird behavior:
  
I enter copy mode
 
select a word in the middle of a line using the normal emacs commands
 
yank that word
 
exit copy mode
 
paste that word
 
 For instance, I use ps to enumerate processes, select a process ID using copy mode, then try to kill $my-selected-id.
 What happens is the whole line is pasted instead of the single word.
 Anyone experienced this and has a way to fix this?

But how do I submit my comments to GitHub. I have tried a number of M-x calls but non of them is working for me. How do I submit my comment replies? I really like the package by the way, It&#x27;s great to be able to do code reviews from inside Emacs.

                    <span>Hey guys. I made an ilambda tutorial, which I demo&#x27;d at emacsconf. You just need an OpenAI key to try this out, for which there is no waitlist.
 You can run it without the full bloat of pen.el. I&#x27;m going to try to put this into melpa soon!
 This is what I&#x27;ve spent the last day on. This is a library that lets you interface with language models through programming. It separates the peas and carrots of real and imaginary, through lisp function and macro syntax.

                    <span>I&#x27;m running EMACS in a git bash window (intentionally, so I have access to the mingw tools &amp; ecosystem), but I frequently encounter crashes. I would say it could happen up to 3 times in a 2 hour coding session.
 Mostly I develop using Common Lips connected through SLIME -- but I&#x27;m not sure if the crash is related to this.
 Has anyone else here encountered this? Any tips for debugging next time this happens?

                    <span>Hello! So I&#x27;ve been interested in Haskell for quite a while now: I know how to use monads, transformers, some type level programming too... However I have no idea when to use these. For example, I once wrote a twitch chat bot in Haskell. How do I decide whether to do sendMsg :: TwitchBot -&gt; Text -&gt; IO () Or sendMsg :: Text -&gt; TwitchBotM () ? The latter seemed tempting, but in practice I rarely chained anything, and I mostly worked in MonadIO, so it just bloated the code as I had to do runTwitchBotM twitchBot (...) everywhere.
 How can I learn to make these kinds of decisions beforehand?
 Thanks :)

                    <span>We have a microservices architecture where each service is in its own git repo. We&#x27;d like each git repo to use the same hlint.yaml. We could use submodules, subrepos, etc. But it would be simpler for us if we could point hlint to a link like so
 # .hlint.yaml https://github.com/OurCompany/hlint/hlint.yaml 
 But assuming that&#x27;s not possible, how have you solved this problem? Should we just use subrepo or submodules?

                    <span>Hey, long time lurker here. I already tried to solve last years advent of code in Haskell, but struggled a bit with the tooling (Mostly a me-problem, but I didn&#x27;t have the time to both solve the AoC problems and learn enough about stack to solve my problems).
 Now, for rust, there is cargo-aoc which minimizes friction to a great extend.
 Is there something similar for Haskell available, too? Or at least a decent project template where I can focus on solving the tasks without fighting the tooling?
 EDIT: Searching for one brought up this thread, but one of them is down and I can&#x27;t judge the quality of the other one in there.

                    <span>I am fairly new to org-mode publishing and am trying to move the table of contents from the top to after an abstract statement. My approach is to initialize the file with #+OPTIONS: toc:nil... (among other settings) and then later define #+TOC: headlines 2 where I want the table of contents to appear.
 My problem is that with the above approach, I get two tables of contents - one at the beginning of the file and another where I declared the #+TOC:... Is there something else in org-mode with precedence over the #+OPTIONS: statement? Is there a way to &quot;force&quot; the suppression of the top-of-file toc?

                    <span>Where I work, we use a lot of Markdown and Confluence pages for documentation. I have wanted to introduce org-mode, but am always met with some (justified) resistance. We&#x27;re talking about introducing a programming editor to mid-senior level programmers. That is a very tough sell. I&#x27;ve been keeping my eyes open for possible alternatives, like org-mode for VS Code and org-mode for Vim. I think this presentation given at the Emacs Conference a couple of days ago captures the &quot;spirit&quot; of what would be needed to get others who insist on using the &quot;lesser editors&quot; to use org-mode. https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/org-outside/

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to work more in Scala. It&#x27;s pretty close to the ideal language for me to use. However, I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a setup that &#x27;just works&#x27;, especially in Scala 3. 
 I&#x27;d like to hear what does work for people, so I could get a nudge in the right direction. I&#x27;m sorry if I should just &#x27;read the docs&#x27;, but I&#x27;ve been scratching my head for a while, so I could use some tips.
 Any input is appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;m not a coder, but I&#x27;d like to able to &quot;comment out&quot; sections of a file (like a part of a video script I decided not to use but don&#x27;t want to delete).
I see that I can open with !-- and close with -- in The Archive. I read somewhere that sometimes markdown wants three dashes at the beginning. What say you?
If I want to comment out a paragraph, is this a good way to do it?
!-- THIS PART SUCKS
EDIT: I had to remove the &quot;&quot; because it commented out most of my post 😂</span>

                    <span>This bug occurs with v1.7.5 Beta (2021-11-17)
I&#x27;m restarting a writing project and using the symbol ✔︎ as an indicator for completing a section of the outline.
The ✔︎ symbol is placed in a note, then the editor is switched to a different zettel, and the symbol disappears until some edit is made. Weird and hard to isolate and reproduce. 

Here is a better example but a little different.  When I add a checkmark (any edit will invoke this behavior), all the others disappear until the editor&#x27;s focus is refreshed by looking at a different zettel. If an edit is made to the line with the invisible checkmark, the checkmark on that line only will reappear.</span>

  My interval | 0 1 2 3 4 | | | + - - - - -+ ↑ insert char here 
 Can I insert some character in the uparrow position without shifting the RIGHT plug sign?
 Is there any shortcut key to do so

                    <span>Some time ago I was looking for an s-expression to latex converter library to write latex equations in lisp and have them appear seamlessly in src blocks in org mode.
 I did not really find was I was looking for so I did this while watching the conference this weekend ;)
 Maybe this is useful for someone else too, plus I&#x27;d appreciate comments. I&#x27;m still figuring out how I really want it to be like and to use it, but it should be ready to go for most purposes.

 PS: I&#x27;m still writing documentation and so on, maybe go ahead and look at the examples

                    <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;m new to emacs, and am an ex-vimmer. I used to use doom emacs, but I now have decided to use vanilla emacs (gccemacs 28). I have almost everything setup, with lsp. Evil is giving me slight problems. My problem is that for certain minor modes like view-mode, I can&#x27;t use my space bar as the leader key anymore, since it is remapped by view-mode to scroll. I also can&#x27;t use my space bar in dired. The major info mode also doesn&#x27;t integrate very well with evil. If someone could tell me a solution or share their configs, that would be great ! :)

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Often i see navigation pattern similar to following:
  
- Word/Line movement (backward-word, forward-word, move-beginning-of-line, move-end-of-line) 
 - Bigger Jumps (isearch-forward, isearch-backward, ace-jump-mode, avy-goto-char-timer) 
 - Fine-tuning (previous-line, next-line, left-char, right-char)
  
Does this also apply for org-mode or are you using more org orientated commands like org-shifttab (S-TAB), org-next-visible-heading (C-c C-n), etc to move around?

                    <span>I personally wish emacs had native treesitter, lsp, and dap support as well as better graphical abilities. The editing lag (doom) is also much worse than my neovim config, especially as files grow. 
 What do you think emacs needs to stay competent?

 EMSAllure SVG font rendered in Gerber format
 Do you want fancy fonts on your PCB silkscreen? You can use a Hershey font or stroke font in SVG format to achieve the desired result. A small collection of these fonts are available at https://gitlab.com/oskay/svg-fonts .

 Hi, I&#x27;ve recently been red pilled into Linux and currently am running Fedora.
 I find navigating my computer via a &#x27;Terminal&#x27; (if that&#x27;s the correct terminology) to be the ultimate way to use a computer for my use case of simplicity and productivity.
 Being new to Linux, how would I go about having a similar &#x27;setup&#x27; as shown in this video, being able to navigate my computer via this &#x27;terminal&#x27; with a file directory and have multiple windows etc?
 (I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;ll like to settle on using emacs if that helps/is relevant)
 Thank-you in advance

                    <span>So, I&#x27;m new to emacs but longtime vim user. I wanted to see what all the rage is about -- the only thing stopping me from using emacs is well.. I have nooooooooo idea where to start...
 I want setup emacs to do the same thing my vim does or close:
  
Have typescript/javascript support
 Have HTML, CSS, SCSS etc support - I think this is webmode?
 Fuzzy finder
 Indent guides
 Sexy colorschemes :) (non-negotiable lol)
 I prefer to work in the terminal so if I can get icon support in terminal that would amazing. I know this is possible... if vim can do it then emacs can.
 Vim keybinds.. again, non-negotiable.
  
I feel like this might be a bit too much lol.. but primarily would like to have really solid support for web development.

                    <span>Hello! I recently hopped to Arch from Ubuntu. I was using mu4e and I had a working configuration, but I can&#x27;t make it work on Arch. It&#x27;s strange because it almost works, until it doesn&#x27;t. Offlineimap works fine pulling down all my email from 3 accounts, my .emacs config loads without any erros, everything seems ok up to the point where I see &quot;[mu4e] Select context: (list my 3 contexts)&quot;, but when I do it just does nothing. It doesn&#x27;t throw an error. Just stays in the buffer I was. C-x C-b doesn&#x27;t list mu4e. I have no idea where I should start in terms of troubleshooting. I would appreciate any thoughts.

For all his faults, RMS has given us something very, VERY special and I for one will be forever grateful to him and the community.

                    <span>This is a bug fix release for two regressions found after releasing 1.5.0:
 ​
 - [#2365](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issue/2365): hs-boot files not handled correctly, discovered in the ghc codebase and fixed with [#2377](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2377)
 - [#2379](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issue/2379): &#x60;tried to look at linkable for GetModIfaceWithoutLinkable for NormalizedFilePath...&#x60; error handling template haskell, fixed with [#2380](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2380)
 ​
 Both quick fixes thanks to u/pepeiborra
 ​
 Also it fixes some long standing bugs in the hlint plugin due to comments being ignored (see [#2366](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2366))

 Would be happy if r/haskell could contribute as well — preferably in the Twitter thread, but comments here would also work.

                    <span>I am currently trying to implement surreal numbers (using Conways definition) in Haskell.For this, I would like to filter a data type to create a new type.e.G. I have defined some data that can be filtereddata Raw &#x3D; ...isValid :: Raw -&gt; Bool
 and I would like to produce a new type consisting of x :: Raw such that isValid x &#x3D;&#x3D; True .
 My current method has the unfiltered type where I need to function isValid to recurse through the object instead of having it neatly inside the data definiton.
 module Surreal where
 -- unlike Conways definition, the arguments may be invalid Numbers
 -- use isValid to recurse through arguments
 data Number &#x3D; Pair [Number] [Number]
 deriving (Show,Eq)
 -- Examples of Numbers
 zero &#x3D; Pair [] []
 one &#x3D; Pair [zero] []
 minusone &#x3D; Pair [] [zero]
 star &#x3D; Pair [zero] [zero]
 -- x &#x3D; (l1,r1) &gt;&#x3D; y &#x3D; (l2,r2) if
 -- ! exists r in r1 : r  Number -&gt; Bool
 geq (Pair l1 r1) (Pair l2 r2) &#x3D; (first ++ second &#x3D;&#x3D; [])
 where
 first &#x3D; [ r | r  Number -&gt; Bool
 leq x y &#x3D; geq y x
 -- x &#x3D; (l,r) is valid if
 -- ! exists s in l, t in r : s &gt;&#x3D; t
 isValid&#x27; (Pair l r) &#x3D; (invalids &#x3D;&#x3D; [])
 where
 invalids &#x3D; [(s,t) | s &lt;- l, t &lt;- r, geq s t]
 -- to ensure that the subobjects are valid themselves
 isValid (Pair l r) &#x3D; isValid&#x27; (Pair l r) &amp;&amp; foldr1 (&amp;&amp;) childrenValid
 where
 childrenValid &#x3D; map isValid (l ++ r)

                    <span>For example, suppose we had a relation on records where A ≤ B exactly when B has all the fields that A has and possibly some extra fields. That is to say, let the relation on records be induced by the subset relation on the sets of field labels.
 Example:
 data A &#x3D; A {x, y: Int} data B &#x3D; B {x, y, z: Int} 
 Here, B has an extra field z, so we are justified in saying that A ≤ B.
 Now:
  
A function that takes A can also take B (and ignore all the extra fields).
 In other words, if f ∷ A → Y and b ∷ B, then f b ∷ Y is well-typed.
 
A function that gives B can also give A (and forget all the extra fields).
 In other words, if f ∷ X → B and x ∷ X, then f x ∷ B is well-typed.
 
 This can currently be done by writing boring code, so having it as a feature would reduce the amount of boring code, which is good. In real life, records tend to be big, so the reduction is substantial.
 A dual construction can be offered for sum types: for example, a function that can take A + B can handle an A or a B as well.
 Is this less than ideal? What are the problems? In a dream world of infinite possibilities, where you can add subtyping to Haskell, how would you go about it?
  
I imagine there are some people here that know everything there is to know about type systems, some people that have no idea of what a type system with subtyping looks like (me — I only know C and Haskell), and many people somewhere in between. So hopefully this conversation can be a common ground. I realize that the presentation above is already too technical for some and unbearably naïve to others. Please ask questions, and please correct my errors, thank you!

                    <span>I felt like telling my experiences of using org-mode for school as a new emacs user.
 So to begin, I am a long-time vim user, but not a power user. I used vim to edit smaller files (like config files, etc.). I primarily used a graphical IDE for my &quot;real&quot; work (JetBrains tools specifically). After watching some videos on emacs (shout-out DistroTube), I decided to give emacs a try. I went for doom emacs since it seemed to be the most popular, and it had vim-like keybindings (evil mode). Once I learned the basics of org-mode, I decided that this would be amazing for taking notes in class. 
 After a few weeks of taking notes in class, I am very happy with org-mode for taking notes. I really like the customizability of emacs (not org-mode specifically). 
 Some of the features I use the most are:
  
Inserting LaTeX snippets for complex math/comp. sci notes.
 Folding headers to keep my notes clean
 Adding TODO tags (with org agenda) to log assignments/exams
 Exporting org files to other formats (especially HTML) to share with classmates
  
What other features do you guys like to use for this purpose? And is there any feedback you can give me to make my experience even better?

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Often i see navigation pattern similar to following:
  
- Word/Line movement (backward-word, forward-word, move-beginning-of-line, move-end-of-line) 
 - Bigger Jumps (isearch-forward, isearch-backward, ace-jump-mode, avy-goto-char-timer) 
 - Fine-tuning (previous-line, next-line, left-char, right-char)
  
Does this also apply for org-mode or are you using more org orientated commands like org-shifttab (S-TAB), org-next-visible-heading (C-c C-n), etc to move around?

                    <span>I tried to post this as a comment but it wouldn&#x27;t let me post screenshots.
 The local Scala 3.0 REPL does have a command line option for no colors. It only applies for the ensuing session.
 In a few cases, the colors do really help things pop, like for example, error messages:
 More \&quot;arrows\&quot; make it easier to spot the mistake.
 It also does make tab completion a little more obvious:
 https://preview.redd.it/0h2h3egg0l281.png?width&#x3D;364&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;a6e88766d297a9cbdf7eeec7fa5e4e0fc7a25d8e
 Still, it&#x27;s good to know I can turn the colors off if I think they&#x27;ll be too distracting for a particular session.
 As for the thing with val and var, it seems to depend only on how you declared that particular item, without regard for whether the class itself is mutable or immutable.

                    <span>Hi Org-mode community,
 At this year&#x27;s EmascsConf, I had a 12 minute video where I explain why we do need a different name for the syntax of Org-mode in contrast to the Elisp implementation of GNU/Emacs Org-mode.
 I would like you to read my rationale and motivate you to use the term &quot;Orgdown&quot; for the syntax and &quot;Orgdown1&quot; for the first (very basic) level of Orgdown syntax elements.

                    <span>Right, some help here.
 I&#x27;m getting the annoying org-mode migration notice, and 5 second delay that other people are experiencing. 
 All the solutions in that thread appear to boil down to: delete org from .emacs.d/elpa, and install it from elpa next time.
 But I don&#x27;t have a &quot;org&quot;, or a &quot;org-contrib&quot;. I have &quot;org-plus-contrib&quot;, but that seems to only be available from Org&#x27;s ELPA?
 Here&#x27;s my init.el (yes, it&#x27;s awful and brittle), I don&#x27;t know what would be the pain point. To aid, here&#x27;s a tree of the directory.

                    <span>Many have suggested adding a lambda reader construct to Emacs Lisp: something like #(princ $1), which would be translated to (lambda (x) (princ x)).
 Well, it turns out that you can (ab)use the existing reader constructs for this purpose. Specifically, ,x and ,@x are translated to (\, x) and (\,@ x), which are without meaning outside of a backquoted list.
 That means that it is legal to define and use \, as a function or macro:
 (defmacro \, (body) &quot;Return an anonymous function. In BODY, symbols of the type $N, where N is a non-zero, positive number, represent positional arguments. $* represents a list of optional remaining arguments. ,(+ $1 $2) expands to (lambda ($1 $2) (+ $1 $2)). See &#x60;lambda&#x27;.&quot; (let ((total 0) rest) (cl-labels ((search (form) (if (consp form) (progn (search (car form)) (search (cdr form))) (if (eq form &#x27;$*) (setq rest t) (let ((s (prin1-to-string form))) (if (string-match &quot;^\\$\\([1-9][0-9]*\\)$&quot; s) (let ((n (string-to-number (match-string 1 s)))) (setq total (max total n))))))))) (search body)) &#x60;(lambda ,(append (cl-loop for n from 1 upto total collect (intern (format &quot;$%d&quot; n))) (and rest &#x27;(&amp;rest $*))) ,body))) 
 With this macro, you can replace
 (mapcar (lambda (x) (with-output-to-string (princ x))) objects) 
 with
 (mapcar ,(with-output-to-string (princ $1)) objects) 
 If you want your lambda to accept an unlimited number of arguments, use &#x60;$*&#x27;:
 (advice-add &#x27;some-function :before ,(dolist (x $*) (message &quot;%s&quot; x))) 
 What are the downsides? Strictly, there is only one. The docstring for the macro above will not be displayed in Emacs&#x27; help system, which will always display the built-in information about ,.

                    <span>Hi, you wonderful Emacs users, I am struggling to get my org-latex-preview works on my windows box. It worked perfectly on Linux, but no success yet on Windows. Here is my configuration:
 (org-latex-create-formula-image-program &#x27;dvipng)
 (org-preview-latex-image-directory (concat temporary-file-directory &quot;ltximg/&quot;))
 On Windows, I have MikTex installed and they are in the PATH, I got this error message when I tried to use org-latex-preview though
 c:/Users/my-user-name/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexD2Xyuq.div wasn&#x27;t produced. Please adjust dvipng part of &#x60;org-preview-latex-process-alist&#x60;. And I just check, orgtexD2Xyuq.div indeed not produced, the orgtexD2Xyuq.tex was produced under the temp folder.
 Anyone experienced the same before?

                    <span>Hello all,
 I just discovered this sub, and have no Emacs experience. I hope my question makes sense. 
 I regularly use remote Debian machines at work, interacting exclusively via SSH sessions. I was curious about using Emacspeak on them, as I’m visually impaired. Everything I’m reading is about setting up Emacspeak locally, though. I’ve found mention of a remote speech server, but haven’t found any guides on exactly how to get it to work. I use Windows as my primary OS at work. 
 In summary, my usual workflow is: on Windows, SSH into Debian, and use a Windows screen reader to interact with the remote machine that way. If I can, I’d like to have Emacspeak running on the remote machine, with speech and sound output coming from my local Windows computer. The lag may make this unusable, I don’t know. I’d at least like to give it a shot, just to see what happens. Again, I’ve also never used Emacs in any way. I’m comfortable in Bash, though. Thanks for any suggestions.

                    <span>I have tried basic keymapping hackery on vanilla emacs and ergo-mode. Seems that C-x is used in half the keybindings - remapping them all ain&#x27;t possible. Ergo-mode uses M-x. Frankly I&#x27;d rather deal with vanilla emacs than try to understand the &#x27;magic&#x27; in ergo-mode. 
 So am I right? We have to disavow C-x for cut and C-c for paste? - My daughter says it won&#x27;t take too long to relearn. Is she right?

                    <span>In every other text editor I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve never had to think about indents. In emacs, on the other hand, it is a constant battle. For example, right now i&#x27;m editing a solidity file with a two space indent, emacs of course tries to ident to four spaces, and i have no idea how to change this. This is always made even worse by electric ident mode&#x27;s insane &quot;reindent the current line when you press enter&quot; behavior - I literally cannot imagine thinking that was a good idea.

 Why is emacs so shitty?

                    <span>I am trying to set up pylsp and have a key shortcut to create dedicated shells in python. The code for the dedicated shell looks like this:
 (defun my-python-start-or-switch-repl (&amp;optional msg) &quot;Start and/or switch to the REPL.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (if (python-shell-get-process) (python-shell-switch-to-shell) (progn (run-python (python-shell-calculate-command) t t) (python-shell-switch-to-shell) ) ) ) 
 The code that binds the key to that is
 (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key python-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c !&quot;) &#x27;my-python-start-or-switch-repl)) ) 
 which I got all from here 
 The code to setup pylsp I got it from this video (29:51) and he also shares his github page and it looks like this (1):
 (use-package python-mode :ensure t :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python&quot;)) 
 It all works nicely: I get autocomplete and the other features and can run C-c ! to have dedicated shells. However, once I close emacs with M-x kill-emacs and open it again, and then I run C-c ! to have the dedicated shell I get the error: Symbol&#x27;s function definition is void: python-shell-get-process 
 I tested not defining (1) and just the code that gives the dedicated shells and it does not have that behavior, namely, I can close emacs, open it again and the dedicated shells can still be launched with C-c ! . That tells me, the problem is generated when I introduce (1), but I am not sure why and more importantly how to fix it. I&#x27;d appreciate any help.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to build emacs from source (Centos 7 has a very old emacs), and i&#x27;m getting a strange error when compiling fingerprint.o 
 fingerprint.c:66:3: fatal error: opening dependency file deps/fingerprint.d: No such file or directory }; ^ 
 I checked this file inside and I found something annoying
 volatile unsigned char fingerprint[] &#x3D; { 0xDE, 0x86, 0xBB, 0x99, 0xFF, 0xF5, 0x46, 0x9A, 0x9E, 0x3F, 0x9F, 0x5D, 0x9A, 0xDF, 0xF0, 0x91, 0xBD, 0xCD, 0xC1, 0xE8, 0x0C, 0x16, 0x1E, 0xAF, 0xB8, 0x6C, 0xE2, 0x2B, 0xB1, 0x24, 0xCE, 0xB0, }; 
 As you can see this array has a trailing comma. This array comes from 
 shuf -i 0-255 -n 32 -r | awk &#x27;{printf &quot; 0x%.02X,\n&quot;, $0}&#x27; 
 and output has a trailing comma too
  0x8B, 0x74, 0x47, 0x92, 0x34, 0x61, 0xFE, 0x6B, 0x27, 0xDB, 0x4E, 0x78, 0x6F, 0xD6, 0x37, 0x2D, 0x60, 0xF1, 0x0B, 0x79, 0xD7, 0xBC, 0xC3, 0x21, 0x9E, 0x4E, 0x63, 0x05, 0x1D, 0xB5, 0x63, 0x93, 
 Is this correct? is this trailing comma normal, or something in my OS is misconfigured.

 Jet is a structural editor for JSON.
 That is, it&#x27;s an editor which is aware of the structure of JSON and allows you to manipulate it directly. As a result, the document is always in a valid state. 
 $ cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install jet $ jet my.json 
 Hit &#x27;?&#x27; for the key bindings. Maybe back up any important files first. 
 Give it a go and let me know what you think https://github.com/ChrisPenner/jet
 ​
 The implementation uses a zipper over a Cofree tree, which should be pretty adaptable to most recursive structures (e.g. ASTs). You can find the Cofree Zipper here: https://github.com/ChrisPenner/recursive-zipper#readme
 ​
 To head off the &quot;just use a text-editor&quot; comments; yes, you should probably just use a text editor. This was mainly written as a research exercise for more complex structural editors, and also because I couldn&#x27;t find many good resources on writing structural editors and wanted to see what the abstractions might look like. Hopefully you enjoy the experiment as much as I enjoyed writing it 😄
 ​
 Cheers!

                    <span>I have two questions one involves type inference and the other involves reflection.
  
1. Template Haskell vs type inference
 I&#x27;m using refinement types from the refined library and template haskell refinement refineTH. For example I have these following definitions, the unrefined type: 
 data UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a &#x3D; UnrefinedStandardCurveDef { prime_s :: a, aCoeff_s :: a, bCoeff_s :: a, generator_s :: (a, a), order_s :: NN.Integer, cofactor_s :: NN.Integer } deriving Lift 
 the refinement types:
 data StandardCurveDefValidator instance (Typeable a, Integral a) &#x3D;&gt; Predicate StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) where validate pred def &#x3D; ... type RefinedStandardCurveDef&#x27; a &#x3D; Refined StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) newtype RefinedStandardCurveD…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I come here to ask for help after about 8 frustrating hours trying to solve this exercise, so please help me figure this out.
 I am trying to recursively look in a list of pairs where one element of the pair is a product and the second element is 2 numbers representing its position on the shelves [ (meat,(4,5)) , (soap,(6,7)) , (wine,(4.3)) ] and verify if in any situation I end up with 2 products on the same spot on the shelf.
 ​
 Basically I dont care what the product is, my only concern is that 2 things dont end up trying to be restocked on the same position on the shelves.
 ​
 I have the shelves and the products set has data types so for example I know that Products can only be Milk, Wine, Soap, Eggs, Butter....like 10 more, and That ShelfPos is (Int,Int).
 ​
 What I have been trying to do is has requested on the exercise.
 ​
 positionIsFree :: [(Products, ShelfPos)] -&gt; Bool
 ​
 positionIsFree [ ] &#x3D; True
 positionIsFree (( products, shelfpos) : [ ] ) &#x3D; True
 positionIsFree (( p, (x,y)) : ( p2, (x2,y2)) : t) | x &#x3D;&#x3D; x2 &amp;&amp; y &#x3D;&#x3D; y2 &#x3D; False
 --------(reddit formating is hard)---------------| otherwise &#x3D; positionIsFree ((p, (x,y)) : t )
 ​
 This works for the first pair, it runs the list and sees if it causes any conflict. If it doesnt Id like to restart the process with the second pair. The problem I am runing in is whenever I finish doing this I cant restart again since I trew away all my list on the otherwise step.
 I tried to do this backwards, like always comparing the last element, but I end up runing into a types problem where it says it expects a Bool and is getting a list.
 ​
 Thank you for your time reading this.

                    <span>I am quite new to Emacs and orgmode.
 When I use org-insert-link I am asked for a link and a description. I want to past the link or the description in there from my clipboard because I simply copied the URL from my browser window.
 But how can I do that? By default I use evil-mode. But the evil keybindings not working in that org-insert-link buffer. What would be a good and emacsoid solution here?

                    <span>Hello! Can anyone recommend research paper websites like pubmed but just for computer science? (I am mostly interested in functional programming in Scala, but I guess a general computer science database is good enough). I already know Google Scholar, but I am looking for the official ones.

                    <span>I like programing in scala and I am the guy who wants to become an expert in scala even if I am not this moment. Since my job has been related to data I have started getting a focus to machine learning. Of course I know python is epic but I also know scala can do this like python. I found out spark and smile are good libraries for big data and machine learning, but I couldn&#x27;t find proper libraries for data visualization. Yeap. smile has good visualization libraries based on swing and vega lite. At this moment I wonder other scala programmers how to work and which library you like. Is it impossible for scala to overcome python in this fields?

                    <span>Currently I use prettify-symbol-mode to replace TODO, DONE and some other key words in org modes with symbols from all-the-icons.
 This way has some limitations, like it allows the symbols are one-character. For some key words like BEGIN_SRC and END_SRC, I want a line so that the SRC block is singled out. 
 The package https://github.com/rougier/svg-lib can generate good svg icons. Is there a way to use those svg icons to replace the key words? Or there is some performance issue and it is not recommended?
 Thank you.

                    <span>Hello all!
 I cut a new release in Code Review including basic Gitlab support, a table with feature parity between Github and Gitlab is available here. I am not a Gitlab user myself therefore I appreciate all the feedback from actual users on how we can improve this going forward.
 This first week I received good feedbacks on features and was able to deliver some bug fixes, thanks for all the reporters.
 More details in the CHANGELOG.

 Next, bitbucket...

                    <span>I have a file open in a single window. I want to open dired in a vertical split (file in one window and the dired window beside it).
 I see the function dired-other-window, but this opens dired in a horizontal split (dired window below open file). I suspect this has to do with these two variables:
 (setq split-height-threshold 0)
 (setq split-width-threshold nil)
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand how these work. C-h v on either variable is just unparseable to my simple mind.

                    <span>I think its impossible to fix, but might be somebody already did it.
 When i use vterm for docker build (or yarn build) vterm can correct handle animation inside stdout (by removing previous symbols and insert a new one). But when i run &#x60;dockerfile-build-buffer&#x60; or precommit hook inside magit i see a lot of new lines and symbols
 (only time should be changed, but i see new output)
 dockerfile-build-buffer
 Same build inside vterm

 I tried to figure out if it possible to redirect this output to the vterm handler, but i without any luck. Its not a big deal, but its a bit annoying

                    <span>Hello
 I&#x27;ve been using ncmpcpp and mpd for a while now after I figured out how to configure them (i even wrote a blogpost about it), but since I am always in emacs I find inconvenient to have to always quit emacs to control my music. so I am looking for an mpd client on emacs.
 now there are a few solutions that come to mind:
  
use vterm and open ncmpcpp from that: too much work + vterm is slower than a regular terminal
 use the mpc client that comes with emacs : the mpc client is sooo bad there doesnt seem to be a way to even stop the music (I am talking about the mpc gui inside of emacs, not the seperate commands like mpc-stop, mpc-pause etc..)
 use something else entriely like emms: emms is too slow and I generally want to stay within mpd 
  
so what I want is, an mpd client that has a usubl interface and that is made specifically for emacs (i.e not running from vterm or something else) and just to clarify I don&#x27;t want a 1 to 1 clone, I just want something that works.
 thanks in advance

                    <span>Hello,I have been using Emacs on Windows for a while, and I really liked the audible bell effect (when you press C-g, or when you press undefined keys / unknown commands).Recently, I switched to GNU/Linux (Debian 11 to be exact) and installed Emacs there (I have not included my customization yet, it is a fresh install), but there was no sound at all, even though the system has no problems playing sounds in other applications.
 visible-bell is nil, beep does not produce sound, play-sound does not work.
 I also tested Emacs on Ubuntu 20.04, NixOS 21.05 and Debian 11 in a VM. The Emacs on the Ubuntu machine worked perfectly, but Emacs on the NixOS and Debian 11 machines did not have sound.
 On all 3 machines, lspci | grep -i audio gives the same output:
 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03) 
 Also, aplay -l gives the same output:
 **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: Generic Analog [Generic Analog] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 
 Just like the host machine, other applications&#x27; sound works fine on all 3 VMs, it is just Emacs without sound, so I don&#x27;t really think it is a driver issue that only Ubuntu solved (but this is just my guess, I could be wrong). 
 I did not find this issue online, have you encountered this problem before? The closest thing I found was this post but I don&#x27;t think it is applicable to my case.
 What can I do? Thanks for any info you can provide!

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to use ffap (to open files/dirs) in windows I select with ace-window (https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window). Similar to what aw-switch-buffer-in-window and aw-switch-buffer-other-window do, but with find-file-at-point instead of buffer selection. Crucially, point means point when the function is called.
 I made a minor modification to ffap-other-window and it works:
  (defun my-ffap-ace-window (filename) &quot;Like &#x60;ffap-other-window&#x27;, window selected via ace window.&quot; (interactive (list (ffap-prompter nil &quot; other window&quot;))) (pcase (save-window-excursion (find-file-at-point filename)) ((or (and (pred bufferp) b) &#x60;(,(and (pred bufferp) b) . ,_)) (ace-select-window) (switch-to-buffer b) ))) 
 However, this function first does the ffap selection and then asks for the window. For consistency with the other ace- and aw- functions I&#x27;d like it to first select the window and then do the ffap thing.
 I&#x27;ve tried hacking this with several approaches (saving excursion first, then selecting the window with aw-select and then finding the file; trying to modify this find-file-ace-window, https://stackoverflow.com/a/47624310 , which makes dired&#x27;s open in other window use ace-window; modifying aw-switch-buffer-other-window) but my elisp ignorance is getting me nowhere.
 Is this easily doable?

                    <span>To start with, I&#x27;ve done a bit of looking around and have found a bunch of places where similar questions have been asked (namely here, here, and here) and I still have not found a solution for this. Yes I&#x27;m using evil.
 ​
 TL;DR...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I would like to emulate vim&#x27;s relative line numbers where with folded text the line numbers don&#x27;t skip numbers (as is the case in visual line numbers), word wrapping doesn&#x27;t create &quot;fake&quot; line numbers for the wrapped text (as is the case with relative/normal line numbers), and the numbers for lines are presented in a relative manner where your current line number is shown on the current line and the numbers count up from one both above and below the…</span>

                    <span>I am new to Emacs and I am running it on macOS. I use the GUI app, but I frequently want to launch it from the command line. With VS Code, if I ran code {filename} it would launch VS Code (or use the existing copy running) and open the file I want to edit. It would then exit the code command so I could continue to use the terminal.
 If I run emacs {filename}, a new instance of the Emacs GUI is launched (even if there is an existing instance) and the command does not exit until I quit the GUI instance that is spawned. That isn&#x27;t the largest problem - I can always open a new tab, but I would prefer it to not do so. I would also like it if the file I opened was added as a buffer to the existing instance of the GUI if one is already open.
 Is this possible to do? I tried to do some searching on my own first, but I&#x27;m not even sure what terms to use for the searches and I (obviously) not been successful so far.
 Thanks for any help :)

                    <span>new doom emacs user coming from vim here. so ive been having trouble with php files. did some looking and figured i use web-mode. looking at documentation for this plugin, instructions for installation: 
  
Install 
 First drop the file web-mode.el in a directory defined in your load-path.
 Then, add in your .emacs:
  
(require &#x27;web-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.phtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.tpl\\.php\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.[agj]sp\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.as[cp]x\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.erb\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.mustache\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) (add-to-list &#x27;auto-mode-alist &#x27;(&quot;\\.djhtml\\&#x27;&quot; . web-mode)) 
  
where is my load-path located?
 this insturction is not doom specific, so i think i have to add above lines to some file, not .emacs. where?

                    <span>I am trying to set up pyright with pyvenv. This is what I am doing:
 I am running on fedora 35 with python 3.10 and emacs 27.2.
 I install emacs with sudo dnf install emacs. Then I paste this into the .emacs file:
 (require &#x27;package)(add-to-list &#x27;package-archives&#x27;(&quot;melpa-stable&quot; . &quot;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/&quot;))
 Then I install elpy and pyvenv (I don&#x27;t think elpy is necessary) with M-x package-install RET elpy RET ,then I create a virtual environment with M-x pyvenv-create that I activate and work on, which is literally M-x pyvenv-activate and M-x pyvenv-workon I also install use-package with M-x package-install RET use-package RET . Finally I install lsp-mode using: M-x package install RET lsp-mode RET Then I include this to the .emacs file:
 (use-package lsp-pyright:ensure t:hook (python-mode . (lambda()(require &#x27;lsp-pyright)(lsp))))
 But when I eval the buffer, I get the error:
 Error (use-package): Failed to install lsp-pyright: Package &#x27;lsp-pyright&#x27; is unavailable
 Error (use-package): Cannot load lsp-pyright
 I am not sure why I get that error or what I am doing wrong. Could it be because I am using python 3.10? I had some issues with elpy because I was using python 3.10. And more importantly, how to resolve that? I&#x27;d appreciate if anyone has a tutorial on this.
 ​
 Edit: The code formatting looks awful. Sorry about that. In the .emacs file that formatting (indexing) is fine.

                    <span>I’ve tried looking into this question, and so far I understand that using overloaded strings and strictness are good ways to improve performance. However, I don’t understand how fast Haskell is relative to other languages. Some claim that it is slower than Python; others claim that it can be as fast as or faster than C. The programming language benchmark game suggests that Haskell is roughly as fast as Java and C#, but this is complicated by the extensive use of foreign libraries in those languages. 
 What does this subreddit think?

                    <span>For most people (myself included), creating and maintaining a zettelkasten involves a significant amount of unlearning with regards to how we think captured information should be stored and categorized (going from so-called &quot;top-down&quot; to &quot;bottom-up,&quot; etc).
Because this is a process, and few things are ever complete or &quot;perfect,&quot; I&#x27;m curious to know in what ways you&#x27;ve found yourself catering to or reinforcing old beliefs about information mgmt when creating and maintaining your zettelkasten. Places where you&#x27;ve &quot;bent the rules,&quot; or just felt it was OK to keep some old praxis in place.
I&#x27;d also be curious to know what you feel you&#x27;ve successfully unlearned, that is, what about your ZK practice you feel comes out of having successfully unlearned &quot;the old ways&quot; (so to speak).</span>

                    <span>Occasionally, when I call org-capture, the template selection screen will be launched but then fail to respond to any further keypresses until I C-g, locking up Emacs (and making my desktop fans spin up!) in the meantime. This seems to happen randomly, and doesn&#x27;t correlate with any changes in my init.el, so I&#x27;m at a loss for how to diagnose it. I&#x27;ve profiled org-capture with edebug after this behavior started, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to hang while stepping through it yet - I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s due to the fact I&#x27;m walking through it instead of using bytecode (although I&#x27;ve rebuilt everything recently so I know it&#x27;s not stale) or just because I haven&#x27;t gotten lucky enough to provoke the weird behavior.
 Any tips for how to profile what&#x27;s causing a command to hang?

                    <span>I&#x27;m in the process of migrating back to emacs (for org-mode, especially org-roam) from vim land and want to recreate my workflow. I have a work-issued MacBook that&#x27;s performance is less than optimal, especially for docker stuff. To remedy that, I have a beefy VM on my personal workstation that I ssh into then do all my work in nvim with tmux and it all works quite nicely.
 I&#x27;m trying to recreate that workflow with the Emacs GUI. I&#x27;ve found a few blog posts that talk about SSH forwarding the emacs server socket allowing you to open remote files in your GUI using TRAMP mode. This is not really what I want since I want pretty much all compute, (running makes tasks, using the lang server, etc) to be on my workstation VM and just have a window into it via the emacs GUI on my Mac.
 What I&#x27;m looking at doing now is running an emacs server in TCP mode on my VM, then connecting to that on my mac. What I&#x27;ve read so far is that it wasn&#x27;t made for what I want, just because Windows doesn&#x27;t support Unix sockets, and there are massive security concerns, which is not a concern for me since my VM is only accessible through a VPN.
 I guess my questions boil down to:
  
Is anyone using emacs server TCP mode to work on a remote machine with good or bad experience?
 Is there a better way to do what I want?
 Am I being a moron trying to use the GUI and should just use emacs in terminal mode like I was with nvim?
  
Thanks for any info you can provide!

                    <span>C-s is I-search. The cursor jumps to next matching when you press C-s again.
  
If the cursor jump 3 matching down(e.g in line 100) then I want to keep my cursor in the current position(in line 100).
 I have to press ESC to cancel it. I&#x27;m wondering what is the shortcut key to cancel the I-search without using the ESC key?

                    <span>After playing a little bit with Starter kits, I decided to shape my init.el from scratch and it&#x27;s definitely worth it. TRAMP with sshx is not hanging anymore, and I am now finally appreciating eshell-mode; simple, yet powerful.
 What are some eshell tips/packages that you can share with a 1-month converted emacsian?
 I incorporated eshell-z in my workflow and It seems very useful.

                    <span>So, I was working in an org file with tables that needed to reference tables from different files. According to the org manual, you can do this with remote(, ). This is problematic for a couple of reasons. First, it is very fragile. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Maybe I was doing something wrong with the IDs, but it was very unstable for me. Second, it means that, if you sync your org files in multiple machines, you&#x27;ll also have to sync the id. Finally, and this is the big one, accoring to the org manual, you assing an ID to a heading and the remote call will look for the first table under that heading. But what if you need the second table?
 Instead of fighting with the IDs problem, I decided to do some elisp magic to see if I could grab a table range from a remote table with file path and #:name. To my surpirse, it was very easy to do. All you need is this function somewhere in your init file:
 (defun j/remote-table-range (path name range) (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect path) (org-table-get-remote-range name range))) 
 Then, you have to add the #:name tag to the remote table:
 ;; Contents of ~/table-test/remote.org #+name: remote-t1 | C1 | C2 | | 1 | 2 | 
 Then, from another table, you can call it like this:
 ;; Contents of ~/table-test/main.org | C1 | C2 | | | | #+tblfm: @1$1&#x3D;&#x27;(j/remote-table-range &quot;./remote.org&quot; &quot;remote-t1&quot; (string ?@ ?1 ?$ ?1)) 
 The path can be absolute or relative, and you can reference any table in that file using the name argument. The wierd string call is explained here.
 And that&#x27;s it. IMO, while it makes for longer formulas, it is way more convenient than the current remote function with IDs and have less limitations. 
 I was amazed with how little code was needed for this. Man, do I love emacs...

 do you use it ?
 Can I use it with windows authentication ?
 I haven&#x27;t seen about it in the documentation but maybe somebody knows a trick ... :)

I&#x27;m using server mode, everytime I opens a new client, recent file shows nothing on dashboard neither vertico shows last completions. I even tried consult-recentf, it just says, recentf-mode and shows nothing.

                    <span>im really new to emacs. using doom emacs. i need some help customizing a couple things for the first time.
 so emac&#x27;s default for moving to beginning/end of line is &#x60;C-a&#x60; and &#x60;C-e&#x60;. and emac&#x27;s default for skipping to previous/next word is &#x60;C-left&#x60; and &#x60;C-right&#x60;. i want &#x60;C-left&#x60; and &#x60;C-right&#x60; to move to beginning of line and end of line. i also want &#x60;Shift-left&#x60; and &#x60;Shift-right&#x60; to skip to previous/next word (so same thing as default &#x60;C-left/right&#x60;)
 also im using evil so &#x60;o&#x60; in normal mode will create and go to next line, and enter insert mode. i want to remap this to &#x60;c&#x60;. in vim this would be &#x60;nnoremap c o&#x60;.
 how i can do this?
 thanks

                    <span>In some cases it would be nice to have some syntax highlighting in result blocks.
 Is it possible to specify the type of the result block?
 e.g. this src block will output yaml:
 #+begin_src sh kubectl create deployment web --image nginx -o yaml --dry-run #+end_src 
 When running this with C-c C-c a results block will look like (i&#x27;ve omitted the content)
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_example ... #+end_example 
 Is it possible to have it output
 #+RESULTS: #+begin_example yaml ... #+end\_example 
 We can have it do a lot of fancy stuff even output files according to https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html

                    <span>Dear Colleagues,
 I&#x27;m writing right now NES JIT compiler for fast emulation. I want to interact with SDL interface and other emulated devices such as graphics, sound or game input, so I guess I need to do some foreign calls to Haskell from LLVM. 
 How to do that properly?

                    <span>I’m preparing for this year’s Advent of Code by working on last year’s problems. I am very new to Cabal, having learnt it this week, and am practising problem solving and project organisation on day 4’s problem. You’ll find my Cabal project for day 4 here.
 Here’s the issue. I discovered that HLS no longer flags erroneous code in VS Code. However, it still gives me suggestions on what to do.
 In my Main.hs there is a deliberately-incorrect function called test. I used it to see what was going on with HLS.
 test :: Int -&gt; Int test x &#x3D; show x 
 In my Cabal project, HLS only suggested that I refactor the definition using eta reduction. It did not say anything about a mismatched return type. When I created a random Haskell file outside Cabal, HLS worked as expected and showed me both messages.
 Here are further details in case they are useful:
  
macOS 12.0.1 Monterey
 VS Code 1.62 (with Haskell extension 1.7.1)
 GHC 8.10.7 (installed using ghcup)
 Cabal 3.6.2.0 (installed using ghcup)
 HLS 1.5.0 (installed using ghcup)
  
How might I resolve this?

                    <span>Hello all! As part of my preparation for doing Advent of Code this Christmas, I&#x27;ve decided that I want to approach it more as a project than as a pile of disconnected one-off solutions. In this vein, I am curious as to what the current best practices are around Haskell software packages. Is it stack? Is it nix? Is it ... something else?
 I&#x27;ll be working on macOS, and I&#x27;ve been writing software a long time, but I consistently bounce off of Haskell and I&#x27;d love to be more conversant in it, as there is a lot about Haskell that I really enjoy.
 Anyway, TIA!

                    <span>I wrote my CV with org mode, thinking this would make it easier to refresh it by simply adding new refs to my bibliography file, but it&#x27;s not as smooth as I expected.
 I tried org-ref, but I hardly can make it work again any time I need it.
 Now I&#x27;m trying with basic latex, and I still can&#x27;t make it work correctly. (I&#x27;ve heard about the new citation system but it&#x27;s not released yet and I&#x27;m really not trying to experiment a lot of things and change my whole completing-read backend right now)
 I am down to this situation: at the end of my org file I specify the bibliography file, style, and nocite everything with a * (because I really don&#x27;t want to manually add every ref, that&#x27;s the whole point)
 \nocite{*} \bibliography{biblio} \bibliographystyle{plain}

                    <span>If you derive a typeclass using the derives keyword, the typeclass companion must have a derived[T] method, my question is, why even use a def derived[T]: Typeclass[T] &#x3D; ... and mark data as deriving it instead of just having given [T]: Typeclass[T] &#x3D; ... so then it&#x27;s available for all types that would be eligible automatically?
 Same constraints can be applied to both, maybe I&#x27;m missing something? If derives was able to take parameters, I would understand, but I just don&#x27;t see the point.

                    <span>Hi guys I&#x27;m currently working as a data analyst in London, I am an entry level noob but love what I do. I&#x27;m working for a consulting company where I go to other companies and provide my expertise for a few months before moving onto the next company. The tools I mostly use are SQL, Python pandas, and tableau on a daily basis.
 Today my manager came and said if I choose to I can be part of a new training programme for the engineering(my manager said it&#x27;s for software engineering but my research tells me this is more towards big data) said its for department learning spark and scala, and also do a project with a company called quantexa that are in partnership with deloitte that would last around 7-12 weeks, and then be assigned to deloitte to work in the fraud prevention unit.

                    <span>The local Scala 3 REPL has some improvements over the local Scala 2 REPL, but I&#x27;m not sure I would count syntax highlighting as an improvement. Here&#x27;s a screenshot from a local Scala 2 REPL session:
 Screenshot from local Scala 2 REPL
 Not pretty, but clear enough. Now here&#x27;s a similar session in the local Scala 3 REPL (I have Scala 3 on a different Windows computer)
 Screenshot from a local Scala 3 REPL session
 I should have taken the screenshot to include the definition of f().
 Prior to my most recent eye exam, I had quite a bit of trouble reading unstaged changes in Git. This reminds me of that. But I&#x27;m not getting new glasses again so soon.
 That thing with the val or the var that might be an improvement. I&#x27;ll have to remember to play around with import java.awt._ or something like that in my next Scala 3 REPL session.

                    <span>I am about to do a research project, which I want to do about Purely Functional Scala or very related topics. But I am a bit lost on keywords or ideas that are interesting. The only thing I have done in this field is read the &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot; (red book) as part of my &quot;Advanced Programming&quot; course in my graduate degree. 
 So I am just interested in any project ideas or theories you guys have heard about as inspiration for my topic?
 The research project could be described as:
 &quot;The research project is an ordinary 7.5 ECTS project intended to bridge the gap between your specialization and your graduate thesis. You use it to make sure you have done the legwork necessary to get a running start on your thesis. The Research Project very often takes the form of narrowly focused literature study or a prototype implementation or use of particular software tools.&quot; 
 Requirements for the research project:
  
It must use tools, languages, techniques, and theories that you find interesting. 
 It must advance “what we know” in some way, although not necessarily by much. 
 It must be a topic within Computer Science or applications of Computer Science. 
  
Some topics I heard about as inspiration
  
Analyse cats, cats-effect or cats-parse - explain their design 
 Parser combinators
 Getting familiar with &quot;programs as values&quot; and comparing the way of writing programs in that style with Futures or even just plain Scala. 
  
But I am looking for other topics too as an inspiration. Any help will be much appreciated!

                    <span>As the title suggests, our microservices use Scala 2.12. Moreover, we as a team would like to upgrade all of the microservices&#x27; Scala version to 3.0. However, our boss has the last word, and he said that we need to convince him of upgrading the Scala version by giving him arguments (advantages). 
 If we could convince him in the upcoming weeks, we might start the upgrading processes in early 2022 (probably in January).
 We would be very grateful for any arguments that would convince our boss.

 Is there a way to make org-tabl-sort-lines fix the formulas?

                    <span>Hi there. I am a new Emacs user, trying it after using Vim for a year or so.I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ambitious, but I&#x27;ve started from scratch. I didn&#x27;t want to go with Spacemacs or Doom Emacs. 
 Configuring init.el file got me thinking - What are all those functions? I know that ELisp is a dialect of a programming language called LISP, but knowing many languages ELisp seems so strange. It&#x27;s absolutely peculiar. 
 You all know that Python has been considered a &quot;pseudo code&quot; language in which you almost tell in human English what do you want to achieve.I actually believe that ELisp falls under that description much better. 
 I don&#x27;t understand what all those functions are doing below the surface. It seems to me that if I&#x27;d want to make a AI Chess game by my own rules, that the only thing I&#x27;d need to write in ELisp, would be: 
  
(setq AI-chess-my-own-rules t) 
  
And that would be it.
 Can I see the implementation of each function I have put in my init.el?How does, for example: 
  
(load theme &#x27;doom-gruvbox) 
  
work? 
 Can I see the implementation? Or (scroll-bar-mode -1)? How does that work? Does that tells the X to stop drawing the scroll-bar in Emacs? What is the language that those functions are written in, and where could I see, inside or outside of Emacs, the implementation of it? 
 And how is it possible that I can type a name of any function written in ELisp and it will just work? Aren&#x27;t there any libraries? How does that work? 
 I believe these are trivial questions for you, but I am really new in this. I fell in love with the Org mode, but Emacs seems so strange. I got used to parenthesis, I get it - That&#x27;s the syntax. Fine. I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. But it&#x27;s absolutely different than any other language I&#x27;ve ever used. 
 Thanks in advance for replies. :)

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to use tcl mode to program tcl Scripts for vivado. It would be handy to eval tcl code directly usign vivado tcl mode as an inferior process. However if I start vivado with the proper flags it fails
 if I write
 $ vivado -mode tcl
 Vivado behaves as a tcl interactive shell. If I modify the tcl process to vivado and the switches to -mode tcl I get the following error:
 process inferior-tcl exited abnormally with code 1
 ERROR: [Common 17-170] Unknown option &#x27;-mode tcl&#x27;, please type &#x27;vivado -help&#x27; for usage info.
 I don&#x27;t know what is happenning, but obviously arguments are formed incorrectly 
 How I can pass arguments properly?

 If you have properly modeled footprints (XY plane of the 3D model on the PCB and origin at the center of the bounding box), then you can easily generate 3D view of the assembly. In this screenshot, you can see the generated model being rendered by view3dscene.

                    <span>Hello friends!
 I&#x27;ve been using Doom Emacs for awhile, and I&#x27;ve been slowly building up my own config.
 It&#x27;s almost there, but I&#x27;m having an issue and wanting to add something in that I think would be helpful.
 Info
 I&#x27;m using the Chaotic AUR emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git package, the most recent update. 
 Here&#x27;s my config.
 The issues seem to be with something in early-init.el, init.el and lisp/packing.el.
 Frozen frame
 So with Emacs natively compiling packages, it seems to work just fine. However after it appears to be done, the Emacs frame is just...stuck. It&#x27;s a blank frame. No *scratch* buffer, just a blank GTK frame. I&#x27;m running Emacs with emacs --debug-init for now, and calling kill -USR2 [the emacs pid] will bring it back. Sort of. The GTK frame is still blank, but if I press a key, the scratch buffer appears. Granted, it just freezes up again. My best guess is that it&#x27;s related to garbage collection, but I wouldn&#x27;t be sure how to tell.
 Native compilation
 So while I was using Doom Emacs, native compilation did make Emacs perform a bit better. However having moved away from Doom, I don&#x27;t have the benefit of the compilation process being printed out anywhere when packages are update. Doom has a bunch of functions to have a CLI program, but all I really want is to be able to see if and when there&#x27;s a problem in the native compilation process. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a simple way to go about this.
 Thanks, and have a Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Americans!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a Haskell Gemini server framework. Everything seems to be working fine, except that I&#x27;m having trouble reading the client certificate when it&#x27;s sent. I had to do some admittedly janky things to get it in the first place.
 If anyone is familiar with the tls or tcp-streams packages and can tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong, that would be appreciated.
 My code is located on Codeberg, and the most likely relevant functions are Network.Gemini.Capsule.listenLoop and Network.Gemini.Capsule.adjustServerParams.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a fairly new Haskeller (~1 year) and I&#x27;ve been getting into graphical programming with Haskell using various C bindings like X11, GTK, and OpenGL/GLFW. And while the bindings seem the be very mature and capable, they tend to have me writing in an imperative way (a lot of do blocks for callbacks and such), probably a reality of being bound to imperative languages.
 This got me wondering if it&#x27;s possible to do graphical programming in Haskell sans any bindings at all. If so are there any projects that attempt to do this? The closest thing I&#x27;ve found so far is GPipe, which promises an alternative to the imperative style of OpenGL, but seems to be built on the OpenGL bindings itself.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve done a lot of OO programming and get the mental model of objects representing bits of state and methods representing ways to enact changes on that state.
 However I&#x27;m having a hard time getting my head around Haskell (I&#x27;ve just started). I get the idea of no side effects and I get the idea of pure functions, but I still can&#x27;t grok how to such a language can have state that exists for the duration of a program.
 Let&#x27;s say an object that is created at the start and over time the objects state changes. For instance a chess board. How can I stop recreating a new object (let&#x27;s says it&#x27;s large), in every function call?
 Edit: thank you everyone. I&#x27;ve got some answers which have really made my thinking much much clearer.

                    <span>I&#x27;m using org-mode in Spacemacs. In my org agenda, open items (TODO, QUESTION, ...) are purple, while closed items (DONE etc) are green.
 I export my calendars to org-mode, with timestamps and the CALENDAR keyword. I would like to be able to tell at a glance which items are calendar items, because these are different from open as well as closed items. Can I somehow customize the color of an item - not the keyword, but the rest of the line! - depending on the keyword?

 While my setup previously relied on org-ref for both managing .bib files and fixing LaTeX exporting, I feel like I should upgrade my configuration. I&#x27;m thinking of moving away from org-ref because the package always felt a bit too heavy (e.g. relying on helm).
 So I&#x27;m looking for inspiration. What do your setups look like? Which packages should I look into?
 Cheers
 EFLS

                    <span>Recently, a group of Haskellers within Tweag had a knowledge-sharing event
where we shared our varied Haskell setups with each other, and learned some
nice tricks and tips for every-day life.
The idea was raised of sharing these findings via the blog, so without further
ado, let’s explore the varieties of the Tweag Haskelling experience by
covering a few of our personal setups!

                    <span>Hello everyone!
 Title says. What&#x27;s the best way to define key bindings so i can easily turn them on / off.
 I was thinking creating a empty / bare bones minor mode and attaching all my binding customizations to it. Is it good idea or is there a better way?

 But found some code on stackexchange. Hope this helps some.

                    <span>The evil-tutor and the emacs-tutor are both pretty good, given their limitations with regard to the greater emacs ecosystem. But discoverability of interface and commands remains extremely hard.
 I am really hoping for interactive-tutorials for Magit, Dired, and Org-Mode; at least the basics but, preferably, also evil (or viper) bindings. (Yes, I understand Org-Mode is a big ask due to it&#x27;s vast capabilities)
 Do such tutorials exist?
 If No, is anybody working on any of these and looking for testers?
 Thanks.

 Is this interface explored in other tools? I guess a wifconfig for example, where you can edit the ip addresses yourself would be a fun project, but I don&#x27;t recall seeing other tools like these.

                    <span>I often use M-: (eval-expression) to check or set variable values or as a calculator. But if I try to use completion there, I always end up with the *Completions* buffer. Is there any nice completion replacement package which deals with this use case? I think it’s a matter of supporting completion-at-point inside the minibuffer. 
 So far, I found that:
  
 company-mode is not supported in the minibuffer.
  Helm does have some support for this, but it’s a little wonky. Something about the way it handles spaces makes it unintuitive in this use case.

Now, I don&#x27;t think they provide anything that I need on top of my normal buffer management habits, but I don&#x27;t want to dismiss anything the emacs core folks thought was good to include in a recent update. Do any of you use tab-bar-mode? What does it do for you?

  IMPORTANT: please install Org from GNU ELPA as Org ELPA will close before Org 9.6 
 The startup is insanely long, because I suppose for each single open org-mode file it tries to communicate with the server and all I get is that IMPORTANT message.
 https://orgmode.org/elpa.html says the archive will be deprecated, but not what is the proper replacement.
 My current year-long setup is:
 (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives &#x27;(&quot;org&quot; . &quot;http://orgmode.org/elpa/&quot;) t) (use-package org :ensure org-plus-contrib :pin org :commands (org-mode org-capture org-agenda orgbl-mode) :bind (&quot;C-c l&quot; . org-store-link) :init ;; (package-initialize &#x27;org) ;; org settings (load &quot;~/.emacs.d/settings/settings-org.el&quot;))

                    <span>I switched from Vim to Emacs a few months ago. The actual editing part I picked up pretty quickly. But since day 1 I&#x27;ve been trying to get a config for Emacs that works for me and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m playing bug/unexpected weirdness whack a mole.
 - Getting LSP support in particular has been particularly frustrating - remote LSPs don&#x27;t work, have to fix paths, frames don&#x27;t work correctly on Mac, icons get rendered as bogus unicode characters in the terminal.
 - Getting TRAMP to not freeze my emacs all the time has been frustrating. Quite frankly it&#x27;s a heaping pile compared to VSCode&#x27;s remote server. It&#x27;s slow. You&#x27;re lucky if it works with the feature you want, and when it doesn&#x27;t work it just destroys the entire emacs instance requiring a force quit.

                    <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;m a beginner at Haskell and this is my first question. I figured out how to make things work myself and asking this just to understand Haskell better and improve my code.
 I want to write a file, but its path might exist already so I want to find a free path by adding numbers to the path. E.g. if I already have &quot;foo.txt&quot; then I want to write to &quot;foo 1.txt&quot;, then &quot;foo 2.txt&quot; and so on.
 So I wrote this function:  findFreeName :: FilePath -&gt; IO FilePath findFreeName path &#x3D; head  filterM isPathFree (map makePathWithNumber [1, 2 ..]) where -- skipping implementation here: isPathFree :: FilePath -&gt; IO Bool -- uses the path parameter and turns x to &quot;foo x.txt&quot; unless x is 0 makePathNumber :: Int -&gt; FilePath  And it started to check paths &quot;foo.txt&quot;, &quot;foo 1.txt&quot;, &quot;foo 2.txt&quot; and …</span>

                    <span>I want to write the gui for my iOS app in swift, and the logic in Haskell. How would I go about doing this? It seems for the a macOS app I can create an excecutable in cabal then simply bring that into my Xcode project, but I don’t think I can do this for an iOS app.

                    <span>Working with the REPL, I just tried this
 mylist1 &#x3D; [1,2,3] 
 then I was foolish enough to do this
 mylist1 &#x3D; -2 : -1 : 0 : mylist1 
 then
 mylist1 
 The result was runaway recursion that I could stop (I&#x27;m in Emacs) only by BREAK and STOP from the Signals menu. Once stopped just entering mylist1 again started the infinite recursion again. It&#x27;s like mylist1 is a hidden bomb. Can it be defused? So what exactly is happening with my &quot;don&#x27;t try this at home&quot; experiment?

In that last couple days, I noticed that all the special characters in the text content are HTML encoded (eg &#x27; becomes &#x27;) and that page breaks. Does anyone have any ideas as to where I might look to resolve this? In the mean time, I&#x27;m building and deploying from my local machine which is still creating the markup without issues.

                    <span>Hello!
 I have completed the red book (Functional Programming in Scala by Chiusano Paul) book and exercises, and I am now looking for more beginner exercises at a similar level. 
 ​
 Do you guys know any purely functional scala exercises for beginners? Leetcode seems to be popular in Java, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s mostly suited for this paradigm of programming.

                    <span>Hello all! I&#x27;m learning emacs lisp and getting used to the language. Yesterday I was trying to write a function to build and execute a shell command that I type frequently, to backup some of my files to google drive. I could make it work by hardcoding the commands, but as a learning exercise, I decided to try some fancy, overengineered stuff, to see if I can incorporate what I&#x27;m thinking in Elisp.
 Well, I couldn&#x27;t. I still get confused with the function/var namespace separation, and the multiple ways I can declare things (let, letf, flet, defalias, ...). When to use lambda functions or just quoted expressions. If I should use partial application or just macros (like the threading ones). Etc.
 What I wanted to write is something like this:
 Given a list of file paths:

                    <span>Hello everyone, So I was using org mode for the first time in emacs and it was quite useful. So I started writing some documents using it. But when characters reach the end of a line it displays the ($) symbol. I have tried the toggle-truncate-mode and got some results but again displayed a (\) symbol when the characters exceeded the current line. What can I do to solve this problem?

 I have this very strange problem and I hope someone can help me fix it (or least find out why it happens).
 I&#x27;m using Doom emacs. I&#x27;ve submitted an issue with this problem but /u/hlissner marked it invalid for insufficient information. I completely understand because the information I have is indeed very vague but I don&#x27;t have the expertise to provide more. He pointed a discourse thread with further information I could try but I&#x27;ve had no luck...
 So what happens is emacs starts lagging very badly. Even just moving the cursor up and down is painful. It doesn&#x27;t lag when I start it but after a short while it begins to lag more and more to the point where it simply becomes unusable. I have to keep restarting... Like every minute or so.
 Can someone help me make something out of this?…</span>

                    <span>Hello,
 Recently I installed pdf-tools on emacs through MELPA,
 The keybindings seem not to work, for example I cannot zoom out with the &quot;-&quot; key, when changing page the pdf render dissapears, etc...
 My setup: Arch linux, 4k display (XFT scaling done on Xresources file).
 Installed pdf-tools by M-x package-install pdf-tools; M-x pdf-tools-install.
 Also tried the AUR package emacs-pdf-tools-git.
 Both seem to not work :(
 I do not how what more info to post, please tell me what shall I add to the post. (new to reddit)
 Thanks in advance,

 Here&#x27;s a simple formula editor using SVG for quick note taking in GNU Emacs. I&#x27;ve added few more commonly used notations.

                    <span>Recently I tried (for 3 days only) orderless, consult, marginalia, vertico and embark.
 I was amazed regarding the init time of this framework (its init time feels like zero). I was surprised to find, that I have more Ivy related packages installed, than I need for this vertico &amp; Co framework. Also the documentation of vertico and Co is very comprehensible. Those different packages play really well together. And those packages provide quite some nice features, I haven&#x27;t seen in Ivy (I haven&#x27;t looked for new features in ivy for quite a while, because Ivy just works fine here).
 Nevertheless, I&#x27;m back on ivy right now (whose configuration I lavish and care since about 5 years), because there are some minor things (with vertico and Co) I would have to take care of, before I feel at home.

                    <span>Hey Haskell Devs,
 I am a Blockchain Master student - not a Dev though - who went through an incubation program for a DApp idea that is especially targeting the Global South/Africa and hence aligns very well with the vision of Cardano. Now I am looking for Haskell capable Devs who wanna team up and then also try to get some funding from the catalyst program and ultimately create a DAO that serves the needs of people in the Global South with a viable use case.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to Haskell and need to list all possible ways to pair up (even) lists of Ints.
 E.g.
 [1,2,3,4] -&gt; [[(1,2),(3,4)], [(2,3),(1,4)], [(1,3),(2,4)], ...] 
 Generating all possible pairs is easy enough (shown below) but I can&#x27;t work out how to return only ways to pair up the entire input list.
 pairs :: [a] -&gt; [[(a, a)]] pairs l &#x3D; [(x,y) | (x:ys) &lt;- tails l, y &lt;- ys] 
 Any help appreciated!
 Edit: Thank you very much to everyone who helped, I&#x27;m going to have another go with your advice

 when I add a display math environment using \[ … \] org export will seemingly arbitrarily interpret it as $\blackslash$[ … $\blackslash$], which is very much what I don’t want. However, this does not happen every time in the document and I can’t tell what is causing it. Any advice?

                    <span>For example, given an error if the user passed in 1 item or many item you might adjust the English grammar from &quot;error xyz. 1 argument was passed.&quot; To &quot;error xyz. 5 arguments were passed&quot;.
 I was wondering if there was a library that could handle this transparently instead of the junior engineers littering the codebase with if size is 1 say this else that.
 It&#x27;s mostly for constructing exceptions to be sent to the user

                    <span>I understand the purpose of every course is learning, but I am already familiar with most of Functional Programming concepts (I often play with F# in my free time).
 But scala jobs in my area are already quite low, and whenever there is one, they seem to be preferring java experienced developer (since scala devs here are pretty low in number already).
 Some how I have ended up with almost 7 years of PHP and javascript experience. (We all know about the reputation PHP has in developer community). but every thing about scala excites me (The FP, big data, clustered &amp; distributed systems)
 I want to get into scala but recruiters won&#x27;t even reply to my application because of my background.so hence the questions, does the coursera course certificate help people landing a scala job. (or atleast get me an interview, I understand after that it depends on my skills)

                    <span>First off, I want to thank this community for all the help I have gotten both through explicitly asking questions and just through watching others questoins. 
 ​
 Main point: 
 I recently switched to EXWM because its awesome. I found some rough edges that I have been trying to smooth out and wanted to share a particularly simple one. 
 The EXWM wiki suggets merging framemove with windmove to move between workspaces on two different monitors. I found that framemove considers not just visible workspaces but also inactive (invisible) workspaces. Imagine the following setup
 Monitor 1: assigned workspaces 0 and 1; currently showing workspace 1
 Monitor 2: assigned workspaces 2; currently showing monitor 2. Focus is on workspace 2. 
 Trying to move across frames using framemove could actually cause focus to not just switch to monitor 1 but also monitor 1 to change from showing workspace 1 to workspace 0. 
 Turns out it was pretty simple to modify framemove to restrict to only considering currently active frames using the predicate function &#x60;exwm-workspace--active-p&#x60;. 
 ​
 In case anyone else runs into this issue take a look at my forked version of framemove: https://github.com/jsilve24/framemove. 
 ​
 Honestly, it seems rediculous that I forked this repo since my contribution is essentially nil. That said, I really wasn&#x27;t sure a better way since the original library is on the emacswiki and also maintained by the emacsmirror github user. 
 ​
 That said, hope this helps someone else.
 ​
 Cheers.

                    <span>I am annoyed that when I C-g out of my expand-region session my cursor does not return to its original location.
 In trying to resolve this annoyance I found that expand-region comes with a variable er/save-mode-excursion that is described as:
  
A function to save excursion state while expanding
  
I set this variable to (lambda (&amp;rest body) () (save-excursion body)) and I found that this does not suit my needs for the following reasons.
  
This variable does not seem to effect any er/ commands outside of er/expand-region. For example if I do er/mark-defun and then hit C-g my cursor position is not returned.
 I often use a key-chord bound to (lambda () (interactive) (execute-kbd-macro (read-kbd-macro &quot;\C-g&quot;))). When I use this key-chord instead of actually hitting C-g my cursor position is not returned. I do not understand why this is.
  
Next I tried taking advantage of the deactivate-mark-hook to programatically hit C-u C-SPC.
 (add-hook &#x27;deactivate-mark-hook #&#x27;(lambda () (let ((current-prefix-arg 4)) (call-interactively &#x27;set-mark-command)))) 
 This works great for my non expand-region region endeavours but when I try to use any er/ commands I get unpredictable behavior. I believe the problem is that expand-region resets the mark multiple times and therefore deactivate-mark-hook is called multiple times.
 My next idea is to make my own expand-region-minor-mode where I can probably solve this problem. Before I do this though I want to know if there are already existing solutions.

                    <span>Is there a package that converts s-expressions into latex?
 e.g.

                    <span>Anyone having problem with launching vterm from a TRAMP buffer?
 When I am in a TRAMP buffer I cannot launch vterm. I do not want a vterminal in the remote location of the buffer, but only a simple vterm in my home directory. (I would like to also have a vterm in the remote directory, but it doesn&#x27;t work; anyways, this is for another post).
 I tried this simple function, but didn&#x27;t work either.
 (defun run-my-vterm () (interactive) (let* ((buffer &quot;vterm&quot;)) (require &#x27;vterm) (if (buffer-live-p (get-buffer buffer)) (switch-to-buffer buffer) (vterm)) (vterm-send-string (concat &quot;cd &quot; &quot;~&quot;)) (vterm-send-return))) 
 It seems like vterm tries to open the terminal in the remote location but doesn&#x27;t succeed. 
 A workaround I use is to jump to scratch buffer and launch vterm from there, or use ansi-term.

                    <span>Is is possible to change the behavior of the ‘results’ header argument for the whole document?
 Like adding :results verbatim and :export both in 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +begin_src sh :results verbatim :export both
 ls -l
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;ve tried adding it the document header like so:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +OPTIONS: :results verbatim
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +PROPERTY: :results verbatim
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 -- edit - solution
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +PROPERTY: header-args:sh :results verbatim :exports both
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Also found it in the manual under the section Header arguments in Org mode properties

                    <span>Hello there! I hope this is the right group to ask this, as Im using Spacemacs.
 ​
 This is my first Reddit post, so be gentle 😊
 ​
 I want try using Telegra (Telegram client in Emacs). So Ive been following this link. https://ritschmaster.github.io/2021/06/13/Using-telga-in-Windows-10.html . Which I successfully installed MSYS2 MinGW (some Pacman installer inside Windows), which helps to install Telega inside Emacs. I need the MSYS2 version of Emacs, so that Telega will work (it only works out-of-the-box with any Emacs with Linux and Mac).
 ​
 Now having installed, my limited knowledge made me confused as to why Emacs opens up as Spacemacs (I thought it would create its own Emacs?). But doesnt matter, coz if I can make Telega work, then there is no need to use 2 separate Emacs, and I wil…</span>

                    <span>I remember a couple of blog posts that went viral on hackernews. As I roughly recall both were in the form of &quot;interviews&quot; with an interviewer asking basic questions and the interviewee taking them into a deviant descent into madness.
 One warped Haskell, the theoretically sound and purely functional language, into essentially assembly code. The other (and I&#x27;m more fuzzy on this) programmed using only c headers, or something equally absurd that is not intended to write real programs.

                    <span>See: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences.
 With chrisdone we just added DList &amp; Acc &amp; snoc benchmarks into comparison.
 I think it is useful for everyone to see &quot;if old folk DList recommendation to solve [] problems actually holds water&quot;.
 Because there is a direct comparison with numbers now.
 To be sure I additionally checked with spl (DList author) in: https://github.com/spl/dlist/issues/102 &amp; chrisdone of course holds the benchmarking repository.
  
Where is no benchmarks for data types - it implies the library/data type authors consider operation counterproductive to structure &amp; so those operations made not idiomatic (like for simple snocing the [] one needs to list  [el] - [] does not provide snocing operation for reason of it being counterproductive) - it means the operation to be composite/requires conversion into other data type &amp; so not showable in the benchmark
  
Would note that DList is not designed for strictness.
 DList data design relies on the leverage of Haskell laziness &amp; function composition, please use DList as it is by default.
  
An update:
 Acc claim still checks-out under conditions for purpose of the data type. For example - DList is created to be consumed partially &amp; in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq). So every type has its own domain of application &amp; haskell-perf/sequences currently has not enough benchmarks to show all particularities of types under different conditions of use.
 As I opened: 1. Please, make a traverse test: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/24 2. Please, add to/fromList conversion tests: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/26 3. Please, add a NFData normalization benchmark: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/27

                    <span>Hi!
 I am trying to use {-# LANGUAGE LinearTypes #-} to make one of my user-facing APIs safer. However, I find myself in a situation where I am relying on a third-party function that has no linear type. Is there some escape hatch that lets me take my argument in a a %1 -&gt; b and give it to a function a -&gt; b?
 I tried to google this and found some references that said there were no such hatch, but they were quite old so perhaps things changed since then. If I can not do this I am afraid I won&#x27;t be able to use LT for a while. I just want to use LT to make my API safer, not my implementation.
 Thanks

                    <span>2022 is almost around the corner so I wanted to ask whether there are fp libraries that use and target scala 3 instead of using scala 2 and crosscompiling? And if not when can we expect the shift to scala 3?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working over the last week to read and process for my ZK a particular book.  It contains about 40 short articles by different authors with &quot;inspirational&quot; messages and discussions of life experiences.  I created a zettel for each article (these were fairly short, mostly one- or two-idea articles).  After a while, I created a structure note for the book, grouping and linking to each zettel/article.
So far, so good - normal use of a structure note.  The little &quot;aha&quot; moment came as follows...
At the end of each zettel, (because the zettel contained an inspirational idea), I added a &quot;What will I do?&quot; question.  I didn&#x27;t want to just capture the idea, I wanted to see if I could incorporate it into my life in some useful manner.  The &quot;aha&quot; thought was to copy that question and its short answer from each zettel and paste that after the reference to the corresponding zettel on the structure note.  That way, I can simply scan down the structure note occasionally to remind myself of what I wanted to do, check my progress, pick out one item on which to focus for a few days, etc.
So the structure note became a way of reviewing my follow-up actions.  This is a simple addition that I&#x27;ve made to one structure note, and perhaps in retrospect, it is so evident as to be painfully obvious.  But it both simplifies and enhances the way that I interact with my ZK.  I have previously written zettels about various philosophies (regarding ethical behaviour) and have a few structure notes related to those.  If time permits, I may give them the same treatment.
As an aside, I did ask a question about this process before (of acting on ideas we bring into our ZK), which received a few interesting comments.  You can find the previous post here:

                    <span>I am using Zotero as reference manager. I use my Zettelkasten for maintaining references that are actually in use but Zotero holds lots of unused and unmaintained references (i.e. not in my ZK), especially webpages that i store offline just in case the source is changed or unavailable.
In Zotero it is easy to find duplicates which is the only maintenance i do. Zotero allows creating folders, tags to help with search but i find maintaining two separate systems is too much effort. I also don&#x27;t worry much about unused references because i don&#x27;t see them as backlog, they&#x27;re just collecting dust. But i know there is good stuff in it and occasionally i&#x27;d simply like to dig into it and add something interesting to my Zettelkasten.
I think what would be most helpful to me is a list of unused references sorted by creation date or in general allow communication between both systems for maintenance purpose only.
In previous discussions others mentioned that they use &quot;The Internet Archive&quot; to store webpages or don&#x27;t store webpages in their RMS at all and instead paste the URL to the note1. Some are maintaining a reading list.
Any thoughts on maintenance?

                    <span>I use outshine-mode, which extends outline-mode. This is wonderful for big structured buffers like large emacs libraries. But with functions like describe-{variable,function} I often jump right into the middle of a (new) random elisp buffer, and the text is folded so I can&#x27;t see the text I want. Point is officially on some text which is hidden, but the cursor displays at the end of a (folded) heading. Is there a way to automatically show the text I&#x27;ve jumped to, after using functions like describe-{variable,function}?

                    <span>I recently discovered an awesome capability of Emacs, where I can use occur to pull all matching lines into a split window and press e to enter occur-edit-mode. In this mode I can do things like replace-string to modify all of the matching lines in my original buffer.
 This only modifies the occurrences, and is fantastic! The best part is that I can see all of the potential changes to the original buffer in a concise, noise-free area.
 Shortcoming
 This mode does not currently have evil bindings. I can test my regex by using evil-ex - I get my lovely red strike-through and expected changes, but entering evil-ex seems to disable the edit capabilities of the occur-edit-mode and I&#x27;m left with a read-only buffer.
 Current Workflow
 I&#x27;m modifying 20+ large files with many rewrite rules and have come up with the following:
  
Use eshell to create a grep buffer across all relevant files.
 Test my regex using : (evil-ex) in the grep buffer
 Verify that all buffers will change as desired.
 Jump to each matching file from the grep buffer one-at-a-time
 Apply my regex to the original buffer, scanning for errors
 Save file and repeat for next file in the existing grep buffer.
  
This is not perfect because the regex applies to the original buffer as a whole, not only the matching lines, but so far it&#x27;s a huge time saver!
 Does anyone have a better workflow?

                    <span>The new Org-Ref version has broken my configuration. When I add a reference, it starts with ebib:citekey, instead of a cite link.
 I used the exact config example from GitHub. No other packages loaded, I only used this config.
 Any suggestions how to fix the issue? org-ref-helm does not seem to be doing its thing.

                    <span>On Emacs 27.2 with emacs -q, calling calc-edit (bound to the &#x60; key by default) with an element on the calc stack will bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in place of the original calc buffer. When you&#x27;re done editing the element, you can do C-c C-c to dismiss the *Calc Edit* buffer and the original calc buffer will now have your edited element on the stack.
 However, on a version of Emacs I built off the emacs-28 branch about a week ago, also with emacs -q, calling calc-edit will instead bring up the *Calc Edit* buffer in a separate window, while the original calc buffer is still visible. Then, after editing the element and doing C-c C-c, the window layout becomes messed up: the original calc buffer remains at the bottom, but now there&#x27;s another calc buffer and *Calc Trail* buffer in the place of where the *Calc Edit* buffer was. I attached an image to show what this layout looks like.
 Since this happens with emacs -q, it seems like it could be a bug, but searching around online doesn&#x27;t show anyone else bringing it up, so maybe it&#x27;s either a recent bug, or could it just be me? Can anyone confirm this behavior?
 This is all on macOS, by the way.

                    <span>Consider the following function which pulls out the elements of m with keys of the form [i,j] for some characters i and j. Can you spot the mistake?
 import Data.Map as M subTable :: Char -&gt; M.Map String Int -&gt; M.Map Char Int subTable i m &#x3D; M.foldrWithKey maybeInsert M.empty m where maybeInsert :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Row -&gt; Row maybeInsert [i,j] v r &#x3D; insert j v r maybeInsert _ _ r &#x3D; r 
 Indeed, the mistake is that in maybeInsert I am trying to pattern match on a previously bound variable i. But the compiler no longer recognises i as bound, and it compiles fine... but the code doesn&#x27;t behave as intended. Should the compiler allow this in a where block? I would suggest it should at least include a warning. I imagine many of us have made this mistake at some point...
 For reference, my intended behaviour is achieved by 
 maybeInsert [i1,j] v r | i1&#x3D;&#x3D;i &#x3D; insert j v r | otherwise &#x3D; r

                    <span>For example
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; Int x &#x3D; (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main &#x3D; do print x print x print x 
 results in
 7 8 9 
 and after rewriting with a rewrite rule we take for granted:
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; Int x &#x3D; (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main &#x3D; do let y &#x3D; x print y print y print y 
 outputs
 7 7 7 
 That is to say, referential transparency is violated. There&#x27;s an easy fix: change the type of callStack from
 callStack :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; CallStack 
 to
 callStack :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; IO CallStack 
 Observing call stacks in IO is perfectly reasonable. (So technically it&#x27;s not HasCallStack that breaks referential transparency, but callStack.)
 But I can&#x27;t be the first person to make this objection. It must have been made before the proposal to add HasCallStack was accepted. What was the explanation for dismissing it? I can&#x27;t find the proposal in the ghc-proposals repo. Perhaps the functionality predates that repo.

However, when I try to read the file &#x60;alice &#x3D; readFile &quot;AliceInWonderland.txt&quot;&#x60; I naturally encounter the obstacle that &#x60;alice&#x60; is not a &#x60;String&#x60; but rather an &#x60;IO String&#x60; on which I cannot readily apply my &#x60;functions :: String -&gt; Whatever&#x60;, nor can I &#x60;show&#x60; their result if I lift their return value to IO (&#x60;liftedFun x &#x3D; return $ functions x&#x60; can then be composed as &#x60;alice &gt;&gt;&#x3D; liftedFun&#x60;). Aside: Is there a better way to lift a function than &#x60;liftedFun x &#x3D; return $ functions x&#x60;?
 Is there a good way around this? I would like to just import the text and keep playing and testing my code, preferably without having to play laborious for every step.

                    <span>This is throwing me off:
 ghci &gt; scanl ( flip (:)) [] [3 ,2 ,1] [[] ,[3] ,[2 ,3] ,[1 ,2 ,3]] 
 scanl is like foldl, so isn&#x27;t the first call to the lambda have 2 parameters [] and 3?
 The accumulator and x like:
 (/acc x -&gt; x : acc) --so why is it giving [] as the first element of result? 
 The [] is an intermediate accumulator in the case of scanl? So it&#x27;s like foldl but slightly different?
 This definition on Hoogle for foldl:
 foldl :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b
 vs what I imagined it to be but is wrong:
 fold::(b-&gt;a-&gt;b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b 
 t a means &quot;the current value of some List of type a&quot;?

                    <span>The documents mode are a tree based data structure. A graph based data structure is more powerful to express task dependency. Even we use some plugin like org-edna/org-depend to express a dependant task of a headline h1 who isn&#x27;t a descendant of h1, all functions on subtask can run only for descendant of a headline.
 For instance, what will happen if 2 projects p1 and p2 depend a same task t1. t1 is a descendant of p1. And we want know the progress of p2, the progress of t1 won&#x27;t be integrated to calculation of progress of p2.
 To solve this problem, org mode should integrate the notion of symbolic link headline, like in tree based file system, we have file and symlink into a file. I don&#x27;t think org mode will evolve into this direction, because it is designed to write documents. A document don&#x27;t need this feature.
 What do you think about this limit of org mode to become the ideal task management? How you bypass the problem?
 I think to switch into a graph based task management system. Someone know a good open source graph based task management system? If possible like emacs, is fully customizable.

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m attempting to create a template for making labels with Org-Mode &amp; org-pandoc (Latex PDF).
 What I still want to do is justify the text so that it&#x27;s centered, and add an option to increase text size (to more economically use whitespace as needed).
 This is my progress so far:
 #+TITLE: #+DATE: nil #+AUTHOR: nil #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[paperheight&#x3D;0.5in,paperwidth&#x3D;1.5in,tmargin&#x3D;0.04in, lmargin&#x3D;0.1in, rmargin&#x3D;0.1in, bmargin&#x3D;0.04in]{geometry} #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[scaled]{roboto} \renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault} *Karabiners* 
 #+BEGIN_CENTER &amp; #+END_CENTER do not seem to have any effect on the output. I&#x27;m using Emacs 27.2; latest DOOM, on Fedora 35.
 What I&#x27;m looking for is a couple of one-line commands at the head of the document to accomplish my goals. Any help or input is appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to purescript but I&#x27;m understanding the fundamentals pretty well since I have some previous experience learning haskell. I just started looking at concur and it seems pretty complicated. I&#x27;m thinking making a full scale project is going to be alot of work compared to JS since I want to add tailwind and markdown+mermaid among other stuff. Would it be painful to add non purescript libraries to work with purescript?
 The other option I&#x27;m looking at is using Sanctuary + vue, but I love the ADT system in Purescript so much for defining my domain model that I don&#x27;t want to lose it.

                    <span>Hey all, I&#x27;ve been playing around with general and noticed that it&#x27;s doing something weird. Namely, I have &quot;SPC w&quot; mapped to evil-window-map (so I can do &quot;SPC w s&quot; to open a window below or &quot;SPC w l&quot; to move focus right). However, when I evaluate (key-binding (kbd &quot;SPC w&quot;)), it returns (keymap evil-window-map evil-window-map) - that is, &quot;SPC w&quot; is bound to a keymap whose elements are two copies of the evil-window-map keymap. This doesn&#x27;t affect my workflow at all, but it&#x27;s pretty unexpected, and I thought I&#x27;d check on here to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing something dumb.
 The minimal config I could reproduce it with is:
 (use-package general :config (general-create-definer leader-def :states &#x27;(normal visual motion) :prefix &quot;SPC&quot;)) (use-package evil :config (evil-mode)) (leader-def &quot;&quot; nil ;;to prevent an error about SPC not being a prefix &quot;w&quot; &#x27;evil-window-map)

                    <span>Hi folks - 
 I&#x27;m fiddling around with using transient for building a menu over a CLI. I wanted some insight into typical transient usage. My main use of transient currently is magit. 
 I want to build a transient menu which lets me choose from an arbitrary number of options. I will only know the number of options at run time. How do I paginate this with transient? 
 ​
 for example, show only the first 4 elements and map those to &#x60;a s d f&#x60; and when the user presses &#x60;g&#x60; show the next 4 elements. Or is there a better way of using transient menus with arbitrary lists of options?

                    <span>This is a niche use case. When I use qutebrowser, I have emacsclient as the external editor. I recently took the EXWM plunge. I want to pass the right options to emacsclient so that when it is spawned from qutebrowser (or emacsclient is spawned in general because in exwm, I no longer use it) it spawns as a floating frame. Currently my qutebrowser config.py has the line 
 c.editor.command &#x3D; [&quot;emacsclient&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;{}&quot;]
 Your lisp-fu is greatly appreciated.

                    <span>So I have the same problem with almost all languages.
 Including Schemes. What a shame!!!
 All I want to do is fetch a html file from an address(let&#x27;s say from &quot;http://shenlanguage.org/TBoS/tbos_29.html&quot;).
 I can do it in every language, yes. It&#x27;s not difficult. What is difficult to get it done with one function call.
 Even most schemes force me to do at least something like (with-standard-input-from-url....
 Sorry, but that sucks for writing quick (and sometimes dirty) scripts.
 I want one thing - It has to be done in one function call. Period. No compromises here. 
 I found something like (url-retrieve-synchronously ...) and thought I was lucky.
 I was wrong. It gave me a fucking buffer object!!! #
 Fantastic.
 So…</span>

                    <span>org-edna is amazing for encoding dependencies between tasks in a complex project, but doesn&#x27;t by itself help to find one&#x27;s bearing in the project, much less manage it over time. For example, one of the most obvious things to do after breaking down and linking up the project is to display it as a network diagram - a graph on which each task is a node, and nodes are linked to those they depend on. This lets you get a high level view of the project, in a way in which manually inspecting :PROPERTY: drawers and decoding org-ids doesn&#x27;t.
 I&#x27;ve done some hacks to create such visualizations in the past, see e.g. this bit of bad elisp that scraps :BLOCKER: entries for trivial ID-based links, builds a graph description and shoves it to Graphviz for rendering. I&#x27;m thinking about continuing developmen…</span>

                    <span>I remember using org-jira successfully when I could authenticate with a password. I tried entering my username and password manually, entering the token as password, using .authinfo and combinations of these, but nothing seems to work.
 org-jira fails, telling me to look at the Messages buffer, where I find this:
 I was called, was it with a callback? yes Fetching issues... [error] request--callback: peculiar error: 400 &quot;JIRA_ERROR - see your *Messages* buffer for more details.&quot; &quot;JIRA_ERROR REQUEST: &quot; &quot;/rest/api/2/search&quot; (:type &quot;POST&quot; :data &quot;{\&quot;jql\&quot;:\&quot;assignee &#x3D; currentUser() and resolution &#x3D; unresolved ORDER BY\\n priority DESC, created ASC\&quot;,\&quot;maxResults\&quot;:100}&quot;) &quot;JIRA_ERROR RESPONSE: &quot; ((errorMessages .

 Is there anything obvious, (except entering my token wrong, which should not be happening considering how many times I tried) that I am doing wrong?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve released on ELPA the new package kind-icon, which adds simple, lightweight text or monochrome icons to the prefix margin of compatible completion UI&#x27;s, matching by default the font-lock colors of variables/functions/keywords/etc. Many backends like lsp-mode support the :company-kind completion property, which is how kind-icon determines the kind. Since text and icons all take up the space of precisely 3 characters, alignment is always pixel perfect.
 kind-icon is easy to set up, and works either as a &quot;margin-formatter&quot; function (for supporting UI&#x27;s such as the excellent [corfu] completion front-end), or by wrapping the completion function, for other completion UI&#x27;s which can handle the Emacs 28+ affixation-function completion property.
 An example of kind-icon in action with corfu:
 kind-icon with corfu and orderless, in lsp-mode
 And with more than 6500 icons instantly configurable by name, you can easily make it your own...
 Easy configurability

                    <span>I currently have to read a library source code for some project that I&#x27;m working on, so far I&#x27;m very grateful for git-timemachine, magit (magit-blame mostly) and LSP. However, I sometimes find myself wanting to do some other stuff like tracking a function for example and then go back to where I was in the same buffer, there&#x27;s probably some Emacs keybinding for that which I am not aware of.
 So do you guys know how to do this ? also if you have any tips or packages that are useful for source code reading on Emacs I would be very grateful.
 I love this community &lt;3

                    <span>Hello!
 I use nano-modeline, which moves the modeline to the header spot. However, this conflicts when trying to use lsp-mode with breadcrumbs. Is there any way I can instead put the breadcrumbs in the modeline position instead? I really like how the modeline looks up top.

                    <span>Hello Haskellers of Reddit,
 This may be an inappropriate question for this subreddit, if so let me know and I will take it down right away, but this is a community who&#x27;s opinions on this matter I respect.
 I love math and computer science and their intersection, and I have a career choice conundrum. Here is what I want: my dream is to work towards a garageband hedgefund. I love the math and programming challenges in finance, I love the control you get over the direction you take, I love the immediate and direct feedback on your work, I love the excitement and the power and the challenge, I love the data accumulation and processing infrastructure you can create, I love the high and low level thinking involved. I want to be able to whole heartedly work towards a career in this field.
 Here is another set of desires: I also want to contribute to society. I want to work towards making peoples lives better. I want to deepen as a person and work towards being a human of heart.
 These two ideas seem to be in direct conflict and have left me floundering directionless during my Masters degree in software and math. I would really appreciate thoughts from this community which seems to straddle a line between math, programming, and passion.

                    <span>I was reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good. There was this line
  
Notice how we pattern matched on (x :-: xs) . That works because pattern matching is actually about matching constructors. We can match on :-: because it is a constructor for our own list type and we can also match on : because it is a constructor for the built-in list type. Same goes for []. Because pattern matching works (only) on constructors, we can match for stuff like that, normal prefix constructors or stuff like 8 or &#x27;a&#x27;, which are basically constructors for the numeric and character types, respectively.
  
Here the code comes from hs infixr 5 :-: data List a &#x3D; Empty | a :-: (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord) 
 Can you please elaborate this section please.

                    <span>Say like a c library or some other language. If there isnt a command line version i want to try and make it as a project so i can use it instead of groff

                    <span>i need help switching from vim
 ok so I&#x27;ve been using vim for a bit and mainly I was just learning programming so it was no problem, but lately I feel like I need a better development environment.
 So I&#x27;ve read a thing or two about emacs and emacs is I think exactly what I need. 
 Problem: I spent a lot of time to customize vim. lots of scripts, functions, mappings so now I really dont feel like switching to something else but I dont have a choice. I tried watching some videos on youtube like emacs introduction something like that, but they dont seem very helpful
 So: if you can give me some documentation or any kinda resource i can read or watch whatever so i can pick up emacs and start writing asap, the more in depth stuff I&#x27;ll learn as I use emacs thruout. 
 Thanks

                    <span>Taking inspiration from Doom, I&#x27;m using a &quot;local leader&quot; setup to bind mode-relevant commands, like:
 (general-create-definer local-leader-def :states &#x27;(normal visual motion) :prefix &quot;SPC m&quot;) 
 This way, I can do stuff like (local-leader-def :keymaps &#x27;ledger-mode-map &quot;r&quot; &#x27;ledger-report), making it super easy to access the report when I&#x27;m in ledger mode with a quick SPC m r. However, this approach starts to break down in more complicated scenarios, such as:
 (local-leader-def :keymaps &#x27;org-mode-map &quot;a&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;attachments&quot;) &quot;a a&quot; &#x27;org-attach &quot;a d&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;deletion&quot;) &quot;a d d&quot; &#x27;org-attach-delete-one &quot;a d G&quot; &#x27;org-attach-delete-all &quot;r&quot; &#x27;(:ignore t :wk &quot;refile&quot;) &quot;r r&quot; &#x27;org-refile) 
 First, this is kind of ugly - Org has a ton of features, and I try to use a lot of them, so some of my key sequences can get pretty long. I end up retyping the same prefix many, many times, sometimes with multiple layers of the (:ignore t :wk &quot;foo&quot;) trick (as seen above).
 Second, (and more annoyingly, IMO) doing it this way &quot;shadows&quot; the which-key description for modes which share a prefix. That is, if I&#x27;m in ledger mode and type &quot;SPC m&quot;, it yields the suggestion &quot;r -&gt; refile&quot; instead of &quot;r -&gt; ledger-report&quot; as it should.
 I&#x27;ve been futzing around with general&#x27;s &quot;:prefix-command&quot; and related facilities to try and figure out a way of avoiding this second issue, but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get anything to work. Since my current strategy is ad hoc and not based on any best practices I&#x27;m aware of, I thought I&#x27;d ask here if there&#x27;s a canonical/idiomatic way of using general&#x27;s capabilities to define groups of similarly-prefixed commands without breaking which-key.
 (Also, why is there a distinction between :prefix-command and :prefix-map? When do you need to store a keymap as the value of a function instead of as variable or vice versa?)

                    <span>The documentation states nothing other than how to set it up in org-roam buffer and that by enabling it in org-roam-mode-section-functions, yet org-roam-unlinked-references is not found in the functions to be used.
 What am I missing?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been diving into learning some emacs over the last week or so as I&#x27;m interested in possibly switching over from using neovim (primarily because I want org-mode). I&#x27;ve been deep diving into a lot of new things and trying to set up alternatives for my major nvim workflows, but one that I&#x27;ve been having a ton of trouble with is searching and the previews for it in particular. In my projects I make heavy use of Telescope within neovim and one of the major reasons that I love it is the ability to preview grep results from files in my project directory within a separate window. I like being able to get more context from the search without actually opening up a new buffer. I&#x27;ve set up Ivy and Counsel and was trying to get the same functionality working, but I&#x27;m having a heck of a time with previewing. The closest I&#x27;ve come is realizing that after using counsel-projectile-rg that I can use ivy-next-line-and-call functionality to move the current buffer through the search results with C-M n or C-M p, however, that actually opens the buffer and populates my buffer list. Does anyone know if there&#x27;s some sort of functionality to open a new preview window and navigate through those search results in it by default with C-j (I&#x27;m using evil mode). Essentially I&#x27;d always like this type of preview whenever I&#x27;m doing searches. Also, I&#x27;m not attached to any particular completion or search framework, so if this is easier in something like Helm then I&#x27;d be open to solutions from that as well. I attached a gif of what I&#x27;m talking about working in Telescope

                    <span>I created an eshell module a while ago that I use. 
 Here&#x27;s the description:
  
em-compile tries to determine what commands it should defer to a 
 compilation buffer, and alerts you when it&#x27;s done. It determines 
 which commands it should defer by keeping track of how long each 
 command took to finish. By default if it takes more than 5 seconds 
 then it will start to defer that command whenever it&#x27;s invoke via 
 eshell. You can of course customize the amount of seconds or offer 
 a list of always defer or not defer.

 I have no interest in making this into a package (i was at one point but not anymore), so if you want to turn it into something. Go for it :)
 Have you created anything that you&#x27;ve been hiding? :)
 Also, plz ignore the messy config files. Too lazy to clean up.

                    <span>This topic is difficult to google, therefore I ask:
 Some of my notes will be changed from time to time. Information will be replaced (e.g. I&#x27;m regularly borrowing a book to people and the note remembers to whom I lend the book currently).
 The deleted information is not of much use, but sometimes it could be necessary to recover it (e.g. after a while the book got tatty, so I&#x27;d like to know its history of borrowers).
 (Note: the above book example is just an example to explain a concept)
 Would it be practical to create a git repository out of my org-roam notes folder, or are there unwanted side effects with that approach (i.e. inconsistent database, confused org-roam, ...)?
 Edit: thanks for all the positive feedback, that keeping org-roam notes in a git repository is possible and works.

                    <span>Hey!
 I&#x27;d like to add a face definition to whitespace-mode&#x27;s customize group faces, so that I can pick that color, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to do it. Could anyone give me any pointers?
 Specifically, I&#x27;d like to pick this one from org-mode:
 (defface org-hide &#x27;((((background light)) (:foreground &quot;white&quot;)) (((background dark)) (:foreground &quot;black&quot;))) &quot;Face used to hide leading stars in headlines. The foreground color of this face should be equal to the background color of the frame.&quot; :group &#x27;org-faces) 
 But I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d do that. I also don&#x27;t know what the background function does here or how this works. All I know is that this makes characters invisible unless you highlight them or otherwise change the background color, which is what I want.
 The name of the face doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it does what the above face does.
 Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently using General for leader-key bindings, and I have various categories of keybindings under different prefix keys like &quot;f&quot; for files, &quot;b&quot; for buffers, etc. I use SPC as my leader key, so to access my file related commands I would press &quot;SPC f&quot;, where I would be presented with a list (via which-key) of my file related keybindings.
 Ok I&#x27;m sure many of you are with me so far. Here is my question: I&#x27;d like to create keybindings for language-specific commands, but I don&#x27;t want to create a separate prefix key for each language. What&#x27;s the best way to manage that?
 One idea I&#x27;ve thought of is to use &quot;l&quot; (for &quot;language&quot;) as a prefix key for whatever language mode I&#x27;m in. So if I&#x27;m programming in Scheme, and I press &quot;SPC l&quot; it would bring up my scheme keybindings. But if I was in javascript, and I press &quot;SPC l&quot; it would bring up my javascript bindings.
 However I&#x27;m not sure how to implement that. I&#x27;m a bit of a emacs noob to be honest.
 Is there some other recommended way to deal with this? I&#x27;m open to other ways of organizing.
 Another idea I thought of is to create another level of prefix keys under &quot;l&quot; where each key would bring up the keybindings for a given language. So maybe &quot;SPC l j&quot; would bring up the javascript menu, and &quot;SPC l s&quot; would bring up the scheme menu. This is something I probably could do without too much trouble, but I prefer the first approach.
 Any help appreciated, thanks!

                    <span>To use tramp, I use the find-file function and type in the following.
 /ssh:user@hostname:/
 Now on the very last forward slash, my emacs just hangs there for a really long time. Nothing pops up on the Messages buffer, and it takes a long time before the line 
 [Opening connection for user@hostname using ssh... \]
 appears in the mini buffer. And the line
 Tramp: ‘getconf PATH’ not successful, using default value &quot;/bin:/usr/bin
 appears in the Messages buffer.
 In the meantime, the CPU usage for emacs jumps to ~30%.
 Does anyone know what could be the problem?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to make an emacs package that rips off Rofi-Beats. Hopefully using completion eventually to choose a station.
 ; lofi mode (setq lofi-playing nil) (defun cader/lofi () (interactive) (if lofi-playing (cader/kill-lofi) (cader/start-lofi) ) ) (defun cader/kill-lofi () (async-shell-command &quot;killall mpv&quot;) (setq lofi-playing nil) ) (defun cader/start-lofi () (async-shell-command &quot;mpv \&quot;http://stream.zeno.fm/f3wvbbqmdg8uv\&quot;&quot;) (setq lofi-playing t) ) ; no window for async shell command (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist (cons &quot;\\*Async Shell Command\\*.*&quot; (cons #&#x27;display-buffer-no-window nil))) 
 It works, but it is very basic currently. My problem with it is that I wind up with a lot of Async Shell Command buffers. I&#x27;d like to have no buffers created from the function. Is there something besides aysnc-shell-command that I can use?
 ​
 I also have to answer y/n to 
 A command is running in the default buffer. Use a new buffer? (y or n) 
 when cader/kill-lofi is called. How do I just make it exit without additional input?

                    <span>Hi, we were trying to figure out an ideal way to represent Semver. There are a few ways we&#x27;ve tried representing semver however each has its drawbacks. Here are the 3 possible implementations we&#x27;ve considered each of them have drawbacks:
  
Simple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural
 
Sum type data Version &#x3D; Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0
 
Use a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Patch &#x3D; Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 
 data Minor &#x3D; Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Major &#x3D; Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Version &#x3D; Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Requirements:
 Serialization/deserialization via aeson
 Complicated pattern matching
 This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.
 If we have a new major version and we don&#x27;t handle it then we want to fail to compile.
 1: Wouldn&#x27;t give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don&#x27;t know all actual versions we have.
 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don&#x27;t have a way to say I only care about Major versions.
 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don&#x27;t really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better. Thanks!

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that the first release candidate for upcoming text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been just uploaded on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try.
 What&#x27;s next?
 In the next couple of months I&#x27;ll be working with maintainers of downstream packages to identify migration opportunities. The plan is to patch entire head.hackage (which includes, for instance, pandoc) before cutting a final release of text-2.0.
 Thanks to Ben Gamari&#x27;s efforts, text submodule in GHC source tree has been already bumped to 2.0-rc1. The next major release of GHC (9.4, ~Q3 2022) will ship with text-2.0.

                    <span>Does anyone use Sublime as their primary environment for Haskell learning as a beginner ?
 What packages you use, which linter, etc. What other helpful things do you use ? 
 P.S: I googled around for some tutorials but most seem outdated, I know I can use some more specific IDE&#x27;s but I would like to continue using Sublime.

                    <span>So as I understand, something like this
 data List a &#x3D; Nil | Cons a (List a) 
 is considered a sum type because it is a sort of set theory &quot;sum&quot; or &quot;disjoint union&quot; of the two constructors. A disjoint union, as I understand, is just when you have a union of sets that have nothing shared; you &quot;summed&quot; the sets. So we imagine our List above a sort of disjoint union of Nil and Cons a (List a). Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :
  
In set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).
  
The disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I&#x27;m not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments. Nice if someone could shine some light on this for me.

 Something like the following?

 I appreciate any help!

                    <span>I keep getting this error trying to access M-x org-agenda then &quot;t&quot; for a global TODO list. Should be simple, right?
 I have been following DT, System Crafters, etc. I even went to a very basic ~/.emecs.d/init.el file with 5 commands to setup Org and org-agenda with the requisite org-agenda-files list pointing to one org file with 2 TODOs.
 I have tried this on a ThinkPad Ext Gen 4 running Ubuntu 21.10 and a ThinkPad w520 running Ubuntu 21.04. But, I keep getting the same error. I am running Emacs 27.1 on both. But, I tried 27.2 earlier with same results.
 Is anyone else having issues? I was only able to find one helpful mailing post regarding a change to the Org installation doc as follows: &quot;Important: You need to do this in a session where no &#x27;.org&#x27; file has been visited ...&quot; - not sure what I should do with this.
 My next attempt will be to reinstall Ubuntu and then install on another distro. I suppose, I could also try pre-27 emacs versions, but I like the 27 upgrades.
 Anyone have any idea what could cause this (before I reinstall)? 
 Thank you in advance!

                    <span>A tree model isn&#x27;t the ideal model to represent the tasks.
 If few projects depend a same task, we can&#x27;t express it with tree model without redundancy. A graph model is better.
 It seems org-edna allow express the graph dependency of task (I never have use it).
 But org-edna miss some operation on graph, for instance visualize dependency graph of tasks.
 In https://karl-voit.at/2020/08/14/project-mgt-draft/, the author use plantUML to visualize dependency graph of tasks. But he doesn&#x27;t haven say how he generates the code of plantUML from org headline.
 I think maybe org-roam could be a better approach to interact with the dependency graph of tasks.
 Does it is possible to integrate org-roam to org-edna to interact with the dependency graph of tasks?

 Founded in 2015, IO Global (previously IOHK) is one of the world’s pre-eminent blockchain research and engineering companies, best known for the Cardano blockchain platform.
 I’m hiring for our Atala team who have developed a Digital Identity and Verified Credentials product – www.atalaprism.io. We use Scala for the backend, and Kotlin to define a software development kit for JVM, Android, iOS, and web platforms. Our infrastructure is currently defined in Terraform and runs in AWS and we are experimenting with Nomad and Kubernetes for orchestrating our services. We have an automated test suite, and we are applying Continuous Integration (CI) practices.
 As a Software Engineering Lead, you will be the role model for our engineers and technical architects. You’ll still be writing high quality code and reviewing PRs, so we are looking for people with a passion for Scala and who like to solve complex problems.

                    <span>I am trying to figure out the difference between a full keymap vs a sparse keymap. Looking at the documentation I can see that it claims full-keymaps are faster:
 22.4 Creating Keymaps make-keymap &amp;optional prompt [Function] ... A full keymap is more efficient than a sparse keymap when it holds lots of bindings; for just a few, the sparse keymap is better.&quot; 
 From reading about this in the manual I have 2 question:
  
Why is a full keymap more efficient than a sparse keymap? Is it just because of the overhead of accessing an element in an alist vs a char table?
 Is there a definitive way to determine when to use a sparse-keymap vs a full keymap?

                    <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m attempting to finish up a package that uses comint to wrap around an external REPL.
 The program itself has tab-completion already, but obviously running it in a comint buffer doesn&#x27;t allow for the tab-completion. In the REPL, pressing TAB on say some-module.s will bring up all the available functions that match and pressing TAB again will cycle through them.
 How does one go about having this functionality in a comint buffer? Or is it better to make use of term or vterm?

                    <span>Time for another hls release!:
  
@pepeiborra has done an epic work to improve performance, redefining some of the core pieces of HLS 
 You can take an overall look to improvements in these slides
 Performance would be noticeable in large projects without too much template haskell usage
 
 We have fourmolu support for ghc-9.0.1 thanks to @georgefst
 We have got improvements over import suggestions thanks to @yoshitsugu and @alexnaspo
 Completions also has been improved in general thanks again to @pepeiborra

                    <span>There&#x27;s lots of change (daily it seems) as things are updated for the new arch. It seems that some people have managed to get things built during this transition. Most of the options I have tried, however, have failed to produce any builds at all. I&#x27;ve been on nix. I&#x27;ve tried stack. Nothing works.
 I am certain some people have gotten it all to work, but the canonical sources for installing have not allowed me to build even a basic Hello World project and such knowledge for how to do so seems scattered in mindspace now as far as I can tell. 
 My goal is to just code with Haskell. I&#x27;m willing to do any hacks to just compile my code and explore. Tips?

                    <span>Hey there,
 I am currently working on a project for College involving Scotty/Blaze libraries for web server needs. When I began working on the project, I could build the application using stack, with no problem at all, and recently, I moved the project for other reason and it won&#x27;t compile anymore, saying the following. On other computers, it works well, so I am wondering where I did wrong...
 I tried to install the correct version Win32 using stack install Win32-2.13.1 yet it did not helped much, and also tried to purge my Haskell installation from my computer, yet it did not solve a bit.
 Please remove if not relevant to the r/, I am so frustrated right now...

                    <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to automatically replace placeholders with text upon export. 
 So let&#x27;s say I write a standard tekst like this:
  Hello {{{Name}}} 
 I would then be able to, upon export, replace {{{Name}}} with whatever I define it as at that moment.
 Is anything like that available? Or any pointers on what to search for?
