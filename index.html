                              <span>Hi, I have created my first package for Emacs, it is a very small package to manage the resizing of windows. I remember when I started using Emacs one of the things that I found very awkward was the way Emacs handled the resizing of windows. So I&#x27;ve created a way that is more &quot;intuitive&quot; to me and may be useful for those just starting out in Emacs.

                              <span>So, my favorite font is JetBrains Mono. It is working great with emacs, although as you can tell by the title, it&#x27;s missing something. The font seems sharp everywhere else except some aspects of the modeline as shown in the screenshot below. I&#x27;m using my own configuration from scratch and i want to note that the blurriness happens even in the default modeline. The blurriness also persists even if i make the font a lot bigger.
 The way i have set my font is the following:
 (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :font &quot;JetBrains Mono&quot; :height 120) 
 I&#x27;m quite new to emacs and i was wondering, maybe i&#x27;m setting it the wrong way? Any input as to what might be causing this is very welcome.
 Thank you for your time!

 Is there a way to get the file to open in the current window?
 I would love some way to get some switch that would get the next window opened via whatever trigger to open in the current window, even a magit window or a help window.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to emacs, and slowly building my config. I installed counsel, swiper and Ivy, which seem pretty good. One thing I&#x27;d like to be able to do though, is pass the results of a custom find command to counsel. The idea would be that I could fuzzy find over the results of a recursive file search. At the moment, counsel only lets me fuzzy find the current directory, and i have to press C-j each time I want to go deeper into the file tree, which can be a bit slow.
 On the command line I can do something like find ~/ | fzf with some flags to deselect directories or files etc
 Is that achievable with counsel, or do I need to look at a different completion system?
 ​
 Thanks

 I can&#x27;t tell you what was going on on the Debian configuration (which emacs build, was it using clang or g++, what flags, etc...), but when now when I tried to &quot;setup&quot; again, and I&#x27;m trying to just use M-x eglot in a helloworld like c++ program, it doesn&#x27;t seem to find stdlib (tried with iostream and and string). What&#x27;s weirder that it finds C stdlibs (like unistd.h).
 I&#x27;m having too many things to think about what the problem could be:
 - should I use g++ or clang?
 - something with the installation of the compilers and related packages?

 (defun my/custom-elfeed-colors () ;; Custom tag faces (defface elfeed-search-starred-title-face &#x27;((t :foreground &quot;#d3869b&quot;)) &quot;Highlight starred feeds&quot;) (push &#x27;(starred elfeed-search-starred-title-face) elfeed-search-face-alist) (defface elfeed-search-podcast-title-face &#x27;((t :foreground &quot;#689d6a&quot;)) &quot;Highlight podcast entries&quot;) (push &#x27;(podcast elfeed-search-podcast-title-face) elfeed-search-face-alist) (defface elfeed-search-youtube-title-face &#x27;((t :foreground &quot;#fabd2f&quot;)) &quot;Highlight youtube entries&quot;) (push &#x27;(youtube elfeed-search-youtube-title-face) elfeed-search-face-alist))) 
 When I call the function (my/custom-elfeed-colors) the changes don&#x27;t get applied, but if I go manually to the end of the first line &quot;Highlight starred feeds&quot; and select eval-last-sexp doing it manually applies the change.
 I will make those hex values change depending on the theme, a hook will fire which will change the hex values when changing the color scheme, but it works on the idea that the function is called each time the theme is changed and if the function doesn&#x27;t apply the face rules then nothing works.
 I&#x27;m pretty sure Elisp is aware of the code inside the function but after calling the function it behaves like it is parsed but discarded. Maybe there is another way that tells Emacs to run those line when called no matter what?

 I am quite new to Emacs and Org but in the short few months using it, it&#x27;s been enlightening and amazing. 
 I have experienced two very crazy bugs lately that are very difficult to understand and nearly impossible to fix. 
 I am on latest Emacs (from git) and using the bundled org mode (from git), on openSUSE Tumbleweed,
 running with XFCE + Xmonad. (here is my Emacs config https://git.sr.ht/~teutonicjoe/dotfiles/tree/master/item/joeTumbleweedIKEADell/emacs ) 
 1- Creating a line in an org document that contains more than 2 images causes Emacs to entirely freeze (tested on Emacs 28 all the way to 30)
 e.g. [[./dist/example1.png]] [[./dist/example2.png]] [[./dist/example3.png]] 
 I am pretty convinced that if you attempt this it will crash on you. I didn&#x27;t eve…</span>

                              <span>Hi all. I have this keybind as global to run &#x27;compile&#x27;:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;compile) 
 Now, I would like to use the same key for compile a latex file as pdf and view it. From the menu bar, I have &quot;Command/Compile and View&quot; as C-c-C-a .Using C-h-C-k, I know that this runs the command Tex-command-run-all . So, I tried the following to bind f5 to only when the current file has a .tex extension:
  (add-hook &#x27;latex-mode-hook (lambda () (local-set-key [f5] &#x27;TeX-command-run-all))) 
 or
 (eval-after-load &#x27;tex-mode &#x27;(define-key latex-mode-map (kbd &quot;[f5]&quot;) &#x27;TeX-command-run-all)) 
 to no success. When I open a .tex file, pressing f5 will invoke the original global keybind, i.e. &#x27;compile and not the Tex-command-run-all
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 For some reason the theme of emacsclient -nw (left) is completely messed up compared to plain emacs -nw (right) running normally. I&#x27;m using Doom Emacs; my terminal is kitty. This isn&#x27;t just an issue with background color, because (set-face-background &#x27;default nil (selected-frame)) removes the solid background, but many elements still remain with odd colors. Any ideas what&#x27;s going on? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I’m currently designing a programming language. One of my goals is to have a similar ecosystem of typeclasses like haskell - functors, applicatives, etc.
 I’m curious about the haskell community’s opinion of what could be done better when it comes to infix operators for these sort of functions. How could it be made more intuitive? Make more sense? And anything similar.
 Basically, if you had the chance to redesign haskell’s stdlib binary operators from the bottom up, what would you do?
 Any input would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>I have been attempting to define two sum types and then compose them into a single type. I view this operation as defining two type constructors, each with a set of data constructors of cardinality greater than one, and attempting to form a new set that is their union. I thought this would be fairly straightforward.
 Here is a distilled version of my attempt:
 data As &#x3D; A1 | A2 | A3 data Bs &#x3D; B1 | B2 | B3 type A &#x3D; As type B &#x3D; Bs 
 And then, despite the appearance of various syntactic innovations, I&#x27;ve had no success. Essentially, I&#x27;d like to do something of the sort: type C &#x3D; A | B, but that does not work.
 So my questions are:
  
If there is a way to properly do this, how to do so?
 
If there is not -- why not? Haskell is very well thought out and so there must be some reason for disallowing such action. Perhaps it&#x27;s not so much that the action is itself problematic, but that it would interfere with other language semantics. In any case, I&#x27;m curious what the reason is. 
 
 Edited: As an aside: the project I&#x27;m working on involves parsing. As such, I wanted to create a simple parse tree for a basic &#x27;arithmetic grammar&#x27;, as in &quot;3 + 2 - 5&quot;, etc. To start off, I wanted to create a binary tree and within that tree I wanted the nodes to be able to hold types that were either binary operations or numbers. I don&#x27;t think this is optimal, but it was what was driving the original attempt. The project is in large part for learning as well. So upon trying to do something like: type NodeVal &#x3D; Op | Val, errors arise. I&#x27;m adding this aside for some context.
 Thank you.

 What I would like is one of two options:
  
Open the agenda view to see when I am free, and then to schedule an event directly from a focused day on the agenda view. Of course I could use a capture, but then from the capture I&#x27;d have to open a date picker and navigate to the same date that I already found via the agenda view, so navigating to the same day twice.
 
Have information about existing events displayed in the date picker.
 
 I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an easy way to do this but I haven&#x27;t found it yet!

 Have a few use-cases that I feel could do with some additional structure inside org.
 So, first, I know I can use properties; I know I can use org-ql. I&#x27;m not a wizard with agenda views and you might broadly consider me a beginner.
 I&#x27;m debating between org, a folder full of YAML, and a full-on database, for basically cataloguing various items (possessions, books, papers, movies, games, restaurants, brands, social media posts, online essays, podcasts, etc.). I want to be able to store metadata about these items, link to relevant files, and so on. I&#x27;m feeling the limitations of currently using different apps for interaction with some of these. For example, I currently use:
 - Orgmode for various more freeform notes, as well as for pulling TOOD&#x27;s from non-code files, as well as for i…</span>

All you need is higher kinded types by Las Safin
Haskellers (and even worse, dependent type brained people) are prone to making complicated types to maximise abstraction and correctness. However, you might be surprised to know that you (technically) need nothing more than ADTs, HKTs, and rank-N types to do almost all of the magic you need.

 I am having issues with font-locking and indentation in org-mode.
 For some reason I cannot attach a picture to show the issue for font-locking. Essentially, between consecutive special block definition lines (eg. #+begin_definition above #+end_definition) I end up with the contents in the middle being underlined, and any other special blocks are font-locked to normal text (I&#x27;d like these lines to look like the lines of an SRC or EXAMPLE block&#x27;s definition lines). Additionally, I can work around this by adding empty lines between these blocks, but it is annoying. Additionally, including an #+attr_latex line above a special block leads to the underscore for the special block…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of the workflow articles for org-mode, and have used it off and on for a long time (I was using it exclusively for ~6mo, then got sidetracked, but I&#x27;m coming back to it now!). One thing I haven&#x27;t really seen described is how to track the owners of a given TODO task. I used to have a file-specific tag for each potential task owner (where each file is program-specific), but I was wondering how other people had implemented tracking of task owners

                              <span>Hello, I have a small function that changes the color of the TODO keywords depending on the theme.
 (defun my/todo-keywords () (setq org-todo-keyword-faces &#x60;((&quot;SOMETHING&quot; . (:foreground ,(ef-themes-with-colors bg-main) :weight bold))))) (add-hook &#x27;ef-themes-post-load-hook #&#x27;my/todo-keywords) 
 The result after checking C-h v org-todo-keyword-faces is:
 Value ((&quot;SOMETHING&quot; :foreground &quot;#fcffff&quot; :weight bold)) 
 and the hex value changes every time I change the ef theme to a different one.
 But still doesn&#x27;t take effect. I need to restart Emacs to see the color applied. Is there a function that does a refresh for the org todo keyword faces without having to restart Emacs or Org mode?

 And if you&#x27;re wondering why someone would want this, it&#x27;s for home row mods with a long tapping term...

                              <span>In the photo I attached, you can see how the autocomplete tooltip gets wrapped. I can&#x27;t really find anything about this, so either I seem to be the only one running into it or this is the intended behavior. Instead of wrapping the tooltip when it is near the right side, I would expect it to just offset the entire box to the left.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>I just started a new job where most of my work is done by remoting into servers. Was trying to use TRAMP but it&#x27;s pretty hit or miss when editing. So I decided to port over what I could from my local emacs config to the servers. 
 I use evil-mode. When testing my config locally by launching emacs through emacs -nw, I can enter insert mode, and exit via . However, when running emacs in ssh-ed server in console-mode, I&#x27;m unable to exit insert mode with . From my understanding, it&#x27;s a terminal issue. However, I&#x27;m not sure why it works locally vs not over ssh.
 Does anyone know how to map ? 
 Terminal: Iterm2
 Local emacs version: 28.2
 SSH Emacs version: 25.3.1

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got an issue with AutoKey since I&#x27;ve upgraded my hosts from Xubuntu 20.04 LTS to Xubuntu 22.04 LTS: character output of scripts do get inserted wrongly.
 I&#x27;ve written a bug report to AutoKey on https://github.com/autokey/autokey/issues/763
 Since I noticed that emacs -q as well as emacs -nw -q does not show the faulty behavior, I&#x27;m wondering if somebody else is facing this issue?
 Maybe somebody has an idea what I might change in my large setup in order to get rid of this issue ...

                              <span>Howdy! I&#x27;ve never had this issue before, not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong, but I&#x27;m writing a new Emacs config and I&#x27;m having an issue where pressing ESC closes all windows except one. It&#x27;s like it adds C-x 1 to it or something.
 I&#x27;ve researched the problem as best I can, but none of the relevant posts seem to have an answer. People seem to be asking the question, but the answers seem like they&#x27;re answering something different. Maybe I&#x27;m just misunderstanding them.
 The behavior I want is to use ESC to &quot;escape&quot; commands and stuff. I hit M-x or C-x or M-x M-f, realize I didn&#x27;t mean to, then hit ESC to make it go away. I do not want ESC to ruin my window layout. I honestly can&#x27;t comprehend why anyone would want that to be the default behavior anyways.
 I&#x27;ve tried the following: - attempt 1

 thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have lot of notes about research papers in my Org-roam directory and the database has started to become larger than what I can remember off the top of my head. It will continue to keep growing and I have begun to wonder the most efficient way to retrieve the information. I could use ripgrep or rg.el to find the notes efficiently, but I imagine that if the database is very huge and I don&#x27;t have the correct regular expression in use, then I might not retrieve the correct files. 
 Inspired by chatGPT, I was impressed at how it retrieves info from the internet and speeds up my time for finding information even when I do not know the correct keywords. I figured a NLP model primarily trained on my database would be an easier task and I was wondering if someone had already created something like this or how would they go about it?

                              <span>Been spending far too much time trying to figure this out. I want to have a single shortcut I can trigger so that the active region is wrapped in a pair of characters, e. g. text (selected in the active region) becomes ³text³.
 So far I have this but it doesn&#x27;t do what I want:
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c l&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (query-replace-regexp &quot;.*&quot; &quot;³\&amp;³&quot;)))
 I also have a suspicion that this will draw on the entire buffer rather than just the active region, even though I read somewhere that query-replace-regexp should only affect the active region when there is one.
 I know there are other ways of doing this but I&#x27;ve settled on regex replace as that is a single step and I can also undo it in one step. I&#x27;d like this to be as non-interactive as possible (e. g. not having to press &#x27;y&#x27; to confirm) apart from the command working only on the active region.
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to create a function or set of functions for an org-mode buffer typing &lt;geogebra followed by pressing the TAB key will open up geogebra for drawing, and on closing geogebra, the associated tex code is copied and pasted into the org buffer inside a special blocks figure environment (possibly somehow with a link to the file used to generate it, where, on clicking, I could edit the the image and have it remake the latex code). I know there are things like this, this (I couldn&#x27;t get the image to automatically display inline), this and this, but I&#x27;d like to know if this is possible and how one might go about doing this. It could also be too complicated.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am trying to use org-mode for note-taking and I like exporting to tex/pdf. For code blocks I use the &#x60;minted&#x60; package to format. I want to produce a pdf where I have captions above the code block (in the algorithm style). 
 Based on this answer, I need to load minted with the newfloat environment. If I try to do this in my setupfile, I end up with an options clash for minted.
 My configuration is sort of a mess too, so I have multiple places where I load the minted package, and I&#x27;m not sure how to combine these or which are really necessary to keep... &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-packages-alist &#x27;(&quot;&quot; &quot;tikz&quot;) &quot;minted&quot; &quot;xcolor&quot;) (setq org-latex-listings &#x27;minted org -latex-packages-alist&#x27;((&quot;&quot; &quot;minted&quot;)) org-latex-minted-options &#x27;((...options here...))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-packages-alist &#x27;(&quot;cache&#x3D;false&quot; &quot;minted&quot;))
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 After exporting to pdf, the associated tex code for the #+src block looks like...  \begin{listing} \begin{minted} // code here \end{minted} \caption{ caption } \end{listing} 
 What I would like is to just be able to write in an org-file &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 +caption: my caption
 +begin_src 
 // code
 +end_src
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 and have it export appropriately, where in the pdf I have the caption above my code block in the algorithm style.
 Any help is appreciate. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am trying to understand regular expressions in Emacs. Here [1] I have seen, that parentheses and braces need a backslash in front:
 \( \) start/end of group \{3\} previous character or group, repeated 3 times \{3,\} previous character or group, repeated 3 or more times \{3,6\} previous character or group, repeated 3 to 6 times 
 But brackets do not:
 [...] any character between brackets [^..] any character not in the brackets [a-z] any character between a and z 
 Now, in the minibuffer I can use these rules, BUT in Elisp code I have to use double backslashes where I need only one in the minibuffer.
 Questions
 Can someone please explain, why we need a backslash in front of some characters to begin with? Are they otherwise interpreted?
 Next, why the doulble backslash in Elisp code?

                              <span>Suppose I was experimenting with some Emacs Lisp packages and something went wrong, and a bunch of essential functions (like switch-to-buffer, find-file, isearch-string, kill-emacs, save-buffer) all got replaced with thoroughly broken versions, or perhaps have hooks installed that are now all broken and prevent these functions from working normally.
 But suppose also the eval-expression (M-:) command still works for me, and I can still evaluate Emacs Lisp commands.
 In this situation, is there a function or command could I run to set the running Emacs Lisp image back to the state it was in when Emacs first launched (up to loading of init.el) but without loosing any of my open unsaved buffers or halting any running child processes?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve mentioned this here before but I wanted to let people know it&#x27;s just been added to MELPA.
 Sometimes I find it annoying to keep track of which prompt caused which output, especially if there are many lines of output for each prompt, meaning I often have to scroll way up (or run comint-previous-prompt) just to check the prompt, and then get back down.
 So, I wrote this pretty simple package that creates a header at the top of a shell-buffer, displaying the prompt above the window. This makes it easier to keep tracks of prompts because you&#x27;ll always see the prompt associated with every line of output currently visible in the buffer. (see screenshot)
 Here&#x27;s the package repo with a more detailed README. Feel free to reach out with any questions/critiques/feedback :)

 Some context: ki is a lightweight structured concurrency library. You can find a previous release announcement here on Discourse or here on Reddit.
 ​
 @TristanCacqueray has discovered a small correctness bug affecting ki-1.0.0 and ki-1.0.0.1; now ki-1.0.0.2 has been uploaded to Hackage, the only version not known to contain any bugs ;)
 ​
 In short, a child thread that throws an exception during cleanup induced by its scope closing would likely fail to propagate its exception, leading to deadlock (usually if not always detected by the GHC runtime, which would then blast out BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM exceptions).
 ​
 Here is the issue: https://github.com/awkward-squad/ki/issues/19
 And the patch: https://github.com/awkward-squad/ki/pull/20
 ​
 Please update your dependencies accordingly and happy new year!

 ​
 I have this code right now, and I&#x27;m sort of stuck. On ghci, this works using reifyNat {- int -} fizzString, but if I take out the -- on the FizzBuzz u, I can&#x27;t coerce the Nat into a Symbol usefully, because ConsSymbol apparently is not instanced into KnownSymbol.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve asked around on IRC, and I was told that there&#x27;s no way to usefully instance the FizzBuzz because type-level information disappears at runtime, but I really don&#x27;t want to have to try to learn Singletons. It&#x27;s working as long as I don&#x27;t have to do a type-level show for Nat, but doesn&#x27;t this suggest that I can somehow finagle the code to work without having to resort to Singletons?
 ​
 
 ​
 Edit: gah, got a regression. I can&#x27;t even get this code to work without the NatToSymbol stuff. Seems as though I&#x27;ve forgotten something.

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning Monad Transformers, and one of the exercises asks me to implement the ExceptT Monad instance.
 I don&#x27;t want to start from scratch by defining the type, and Functor and Applicative instances, so I imported Control.Monad.Trans.Except, and used a OVERLAPPING pragma as instructed in the GHC user guide here. 
 {-# LANGUAGE InstanceSigs #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-} import Control.Monad.Trans.Except (ExceptT (..)) instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} (Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; Monad (ExceptT e m) where return :: a -&gt; ExceptT e m a return x &#x3D; ExceptT $ return (Right x) (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;) :: ExceptT e m a -&gt; (a -&gt; ExceptT e m b) -&gt; ExceptT e m b x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; ExceptT $ do y  return (Left ex) Right k -&gt; runExceptT (f k) 
 But I still get a compile error. Isn&#x27;t this supposed to work? I also tried with INCOHERENT, same error.
 Duplicate instance declarations: instance [overlapping] Monad m &#x3D;&gt; Monad (ExceptT e m) -- Defined at src/Ch11.hs:76:29 instance [safe] Monad m &#x3D;&gt; Monad (ExceptT e m) -- Defined in ‘Control.Monad.Trans.Except’

                              <span>Ok, I know what monads are, as well as functors and monoids, and a little bit of category theory (haven’t finished Milewski’s book yet), but I’m trying to piece together this infamous definition. I tried asking ChatGPT because I get to torture it indeinitely until I understand, lol. I think I figured it out, but I need confirmation from actual qualified people:
  
We have the category of endofunctors, which in the context of Set/Hask are just all functors (because we’re limited to a single category).
 For any m  m b (natural transformations between functors Identity and m) and make them a separate category.
 That category is a monoid, with () &#x3D; (&gt;&#x3D;&gt;) :: (Identity a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (Identity b -&gt; m c) -&gt; Identity a -&gt; m c (Kleisli composition), and mempty &#x3D; return :: (Identity a) -&gt; m a, where the Identity monad is simply elided for out convenience.
  
Did I get it all right? And if so, wouldn’t the correct definition be “a monad is a monoid in the category of morphisms from the category of endofunctors”? Upd: Or is it what monoid as a category already implies?

 If you want to include another product type into the sum type, you must define a new type with a whole new set of constructors for it, you cannot reuse the existing constructors:
 data YesNoMaybe left right &#x3D; No left | MaybeYes (Maybe right) 
 Would it not have been possible to define the language such that you re-use existing constructors for the sum type?

 I&#x27;m an experienced java developer (10+ years) and in my current job, we&#x27;re using Scala 2. What could you recommend as a good training/books to get up to speed with Scala syntax (I don&#x27;t mind if it&#x27;s free or not) ?

                              <span>My goal is to have a very very sold understanding of FP, not just to be more fluent in Scala FP. 
 If you have read both books, can you pick me one option from the following: 
  
Read SICP only - (my guess: it&#x27;s a great book about FP so you don&#x27;t need to read &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot; any more) 
 Read &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot; only - (my guess: This book covers most of the general FP concepts in depth so no need to read SICP any more)
 Read SICP then &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot; - (my guess: &quot;Functional Programing in Scala&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell FP thoughts in an easy-to-understand way so you want to read SICP at first)
 Read &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot; then &quot;SICP&quot; - (my guess: &quot;Functional Programming in Scala&quot; is in depth enough, but it doesn&#x27;t cover FP topics outside Scala. So you want to read SICP later)

                              <span>Hi all!
 So I need to browse and work on a very large codebase (LLVM). I am not a power user of Emacs with C++, but for what I understood LSP with clangd is now pretty mature. Moreover, IIUC, LSP provides code navigation via Emacs&#x27; xref.
 Historically the usual way to explore code was using a tag utility, like ctags, etags, rtags or gtags. I&#x27;ve tried searching online, but the resources I found are pretty outdated, and I suspect they are not even aware of LSP.
 So the question is:
  
would you say an external program is still the best way to explore C++&#x27;s code on Emacs, or is clangd + xref enough? Is it becoming the de facto standard? Is there something that a tag program can do but clangd can&#x27;t (or viceversa)?
 
I have heard that C++ code can be quite difficult to index, due to complex include nests, preprocessor directives and what else (because C++!). Is this problem still relevant in 2023? If yes, what solution handles it best?
 
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m searching something like autocomplete for company-mode, yasnippets or something that understands XML ui definitions a little better.
 I tried searching &quot;Emacs GTK&quot; from the web and all I can find is information how to run Emacs in a modern desktop environment. (I don&#x27;t even want to know what was non-GTK graphical Emacs like)

 Is there something I haven&#x27;t seen that automatically chops those down to the length that I see when writing in olivetti-mode, transparently?

                              <span>I just found out on Bastien Guerrys page with org advice (https://bzg.fr/en/some-emacs-org-mode-features-you-may-not-know/) that S-RET in a table can increment a date stamp by a day. That would be a wonderful help for me.
 But when I hit S-RET in the leftmost cell in the last row, the next row isn&#x27;t started with 2023-01-21, but with 2024-01-20. 
 | 2023-01-18 | 18.035 | 22.579 | | 2023-01-19 | 18.056 | 22.603 | | 2023-01-20 | 18.046 | 22.592 | 
 How can I make org-table-copy-down work with the days instead of the years? The variable org-table-copy-increment was set to t, I tried setting it to 1, but that didn&#x27;t help.
 Thank you for any advice!

                              <span>I have GNU Emacs 28.1 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32). I have followed the instructions in the Org Roam manual (https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#C-Compiler) to build the database program for Windows.
 This is my config:
 ;; org-roam (use-package org-roam :ensure t :init (setq org-roam-v2-ack t) :custom (org-roam-directory &quot;~/RoamNotes&quot;) (org-roam-completion-everywhere t) :bind ((&quot;C-c n l&quot; . org-roam-buffer-toggle) (&quot;C-c n f&quot; . org-roam-node-find) (&quot;C-c n i&quot; . org-roam-node-insert) :map org-mode-map (&quot;C-M-i&quot; . completion-at-point)) :config (org-roam-setup))
 I have installed org-roam, but org-roam--sqlite-available-p variable does not pop up.
 I created the nodes with org-roam-node-insert but I cannot follow the links with org-open-at-point.
 What is the reason for this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using straight.el to manage Emacs packages, however for some reason I have incorrect Tramp version, at least this is how Tramp reports it via tramp-version command. The reason I ask about this is Ivy stopped working with su:: if I use Tramp installed by straight.el.
 If I put this in my config, then tramp-version reports 2.5.1.1 and Ivy doesn&#x27;t work when I type su:: prompting an error:
 (straight-use-package &#x27;tramp) 
 If I remove this line, then Tramp reports a newer version (the one that comes with Emacs 28.2 which I use), then Ivy works correctly.
 I checked files manually at straight/repos/tramp and it seems that the Tramp version should be 2.6.0, but for some reason it isn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t even find a string 2.5.1.1 in the whole repo of Tramp so I&#x27;m not sure where it&#x27;s coming from.

 Do you think this is useful? And do you suggest me to use it?

 M-x meow-normal-mode
 which is annoying. I could set it to a keybinding but I&#x27;d much rather it do it automatically. I tried writing a hook using: 
 (add-hook &#x27;ibuffer-mode-hook (lambda () &#x27;meow-normal-mode -1))
 It didn&#x27;t fix it and since I&#x27;m pretty new to Emacs and elisp so I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong. Any thoughts?

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been using nested org-mode headlines to plan out and maintain notes for hierarchies that I later graph via the graphviz python package and it occurred to me how helpful it would be if I could simply have an inline python script that pulls directly from within its org doc. I understand it&#x27;s possible to pass a table and some other data types into a python script, but I can&#x27;t find anything about passing headlines or the content of org files. 
 So in short it&#x27;d be cool if I could pass an inline python script a headline :ID: (or its name in the worst case) literate-programming style and then access its child headlines (and maybe even its :PROPERTIES: tags) as a structure to generate a graph from. 
 Does anyone know if this is possible, or if there&#x27;s a way to achieve something similar? Thanks.

                              <span>Is there an org agenda function that allows you to jump to the next date which matches a particular keyword, without leaving the agenda buffer?
 I&#x27;m thinking of something like org-agenda-goto-date, except that it queries for a regex that matches the headline text, and goes to the next chronological match.
 I often want to search forward in the agenda to see when a particular appointment is, and what else is going on that day. The nearest thing I&#x27;ve found is to call org-agenda, do a keyword search, find the entry I was looking for, and then call org-agenda again and jump to that date. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an easier way of doing this, but I haven&#x27;t found it.
 Thanks in advance!

 I want my captions (only for code blocks) to look like what is shown in the goal of this post (possibly also with the numbering suppressed and the label changed from Listing to Code).
 My hope would be that by either writing #+caption: or #+attr_latex: :name [] above the #+SRC block that the desired effect would be reflected in the .tex file and ultimately the PDF.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have a directory of files with properties like Type Start Fin Title etc.
 I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible after thrashing on it a bit last night and some googling, but I&#x27;m trying to come up with a boolean query that looks for anything with a Start &gt;&#x3D; 2022-01-01 and where the Fin date is &gt;&#x3D; 2023-01-01 or where the Fin date is /not/ present.
 So, as pseudocode: (start &gt;&#x3D; 2022-01-01) AND ( Fin &gt;&#x3D; 2023-01-01 OR Fin &quot;&quot;))
 Something like:
 tags &quot;Type&#x3D;{.}+Start&gt;&#x3D;&quot;&quot;+{ Fin&gt;&#x3D;&quot;&#x3D; and !&#x3D;) on a prop. I&#x27;ve only seen +Fin&#x3D;{this \| that} example-wise
 How is a NOT done (I had assumed it was !&#x3D;) but that does not give (my &#x3D;] ) expected output. Can you even query on the non-presence/no-value of a property?
 Also, not sure those queries honour math order of ops?
  
Is there a way to create that query with those 3 properties or do I need to add another prop like Done: false to get around the above issues? (ie. Start in 2022 AND (Fin since 2023 OR DONE&#x3D;false) )

                              <span>I&#x27;m implementing my very simple GTD system (as many users here) based on org-mode. I was wondering if the *org tags* buffer that comes up when doing C-c C-c can be somehow customized. I would like to have the tags list organized like so:
 Where: [h] home [w] work [o] outside With: [b] boss [M] Mary [e] employee [J] John [B] Bill [t] team Energy: [H] high [m] medium [L] low 
 I know that :newline can get me to separate the tags in different lines, but I would like to know if there is a way to add those &quot;Where:&quot;, &quot;With:&quot; and &quot;Energy:&quot; (for instance) titles so that I remember to tag every entry in all three &#x27;categories of tags&#x27; for context when clarifying an inbox item.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>I want to share a chrome extension to annotate optic operators with their names, which I made for myself; someone else may find it helpful.
 It can decrypt any optic example, code, or tutorial. Works with more-or-less any website (such as GitHub or hackage). It’s not perfect, but it gets the job done – lets me focus on the content and not get distracted by random operators. 
 You can find the code on GitHub and the extension in the Google web store.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the third part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part03SMContractTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced concurrent state machine testing to test for race conditions using linearisability.
 In this part we will build upon the second part and show how to test bigger systems in a modular way. We introduce the property-based testing equivalent of fast and deterministic integration testing against fakes and show how to ensure that the fakes are faithful to the real components.
 I hope to announce part four on fault-injection next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

 Problem is, in spite of handling the DivideByZero exception, it still throws the exception. Following is one example.

 Expr is a Rose tree, but that&#x27;s irrelevant to the question since the evaluation happens on a string.
 I don&#x27;t understand why the exception is not caught.

I&#x27;ve come up with this note about the difference about the Web and Internet terms and would like some advices on how could I improve it? Maybe I can create specific notes about the definition of Internet and Web and link them? Create a note about the relationship between those two terms? Help me make it better!

# Web and Internet Are Different Terms

It is common to observe people using the terms _Web_ and _Internet_ in such a way that it appears that both define the same concept: a giant invisible network that interconnects people and realities. However, it is important to understand that both terms have different meanings, although they are connected.

The Internet is the medium through which all information travels between servers and users. This information, being very general, needed to be contained in standards so that all connected devices could understand and communicate with each other. Therefore, the Internet is made up of applications that exercise this function of regulating communication through protocols.

The Web is an Internet application. It allows users to interact with servers through websites: interactive pages that allow navigation between files and pages present on the server.

                              <span>Tweag is a big supporter and user of Nix and NixOS. In our experience,
however, we have seen that it is hard to maintain a Nix codebase as it
grows. Indeed, the only way to know if a Nix expression is correct is to
evaluate it, and when an error occurs it can be hard to locate the root
cause. This is more of a problem with bigger codebases, such as the ones we write.
At Tweag, we are working on Nickel, a configuration language
featuring a gradual type system. Defining
Nix derivations, NixOS modules or flakes using Nickel would catch more
mistakes, catch them earlier and identify their precise location.
However, the Nix language is used to define more than 80,000
packages,1 to which one could add all flakes, NixOS modules and
Home Manager configurations. For all this historical effort to no…</span>

 Alas, running org-protocol needs to be authorized in Firefox. However, it used to ask for permission &quot;once and for all&quot;, but after I made a fresh OS install, now Firefox asks for permission on every site I want to run org-protocol in, which is certainly inconvenient.
 I&#x27;m not sure the newer OS got me a more recent Firefox version (current is 109.0) for which the policy changed, or if something in my settings was lost along the way. Does anyone else get the same behavior? Does anyone know how to tell Firefox to just run org-protocol whatever the site?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m new to emacs, and still going through a lot of tutorials. I&#x27;m trying to make some shortcuts in dired, but I seem to be missing something basic:
 ​
 (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd &quot;C-c gdl&quot;) &#x27;(find-alternate-file &quot;~/downloads&quot;)) 
 ​
 When i run this I get an error &quot;Wrong type argument: commandp&quot;.
 ​
 Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? Maybe it has something to do with interactive and non-interactive functions (I only do a little coding as a hobby so I haven&#x27;t learnt about that yet)?
 ​
 Also, I&#x27;d rather not use C-c as a prefix, but just use &#x27;g&#x27; as a prefix for jumping to shortcuts in dired. Is there a way to set that up?
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am using counsel-rg to go through my paper notes and currently when I do the a simple search as shown in the below image, I get the name of the file, which contains the date and the spaces are represented with underscore. I am trying to figure out how I can format the results of the below counsel-rg to remove the date and replace the underscore with spaces so it becomes easier for me to read rather than just showing me the file name.

 I also came across this link where the video shows the user&#x27;s buffer changing to the contents of the file their cursor is hovering over and they can just cycle through the results and see the contents of each automatically. Currently, I use counsel-rg and then I move my cursor to the results, and then press enter to see the contents. I wanted to replicate the effect in the link but I am unsure how to make that happen. The following is the function that I call when using counsel-rg:
 (defun local/org-roam-rg-search () (interactive) (counsel-rg &quot;&quot; org-roam-directory))

 I&#x27;m making a project-specific shell each time I make a new project. An example being:  {pkgs ? import  {}, ...}: let projGhc &#x3D; pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithHoogle (hpkgs: with hpkgs; [ JuicyPixels massiv ]); in pkgs.mkShell { buildInputs &#x3D; [ pkgs.haskell-language-server projGhc ]; }  I then autoload this shell with lorri/direnv and hls works perfectly with lsp-mode, displaying haddock docs for the packages. But the &quot;Documentation&quot; and &quot;Source&quot; buttons just open an empty buffer. The minibuffer says File not found and directory write-protected.
 For example, trying to get to the docs for massiv&#x27;s makeArray function opens a buffer titled Data-Massiv-Core.html#v:makeArray, located somewhere in the nix store. Checking, the file Data-Massive-Core.html does exist. However the docs do not show. Is the idea that the docs open in an external browser, or in emacs?
 Thanks for any help :)

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am wondering whether the following is possible in Scala:
  
Given some vector x &#x3D; (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) in R^n and a function f that maps R^n to R, I would like to replicate this concept in Scala. The idea of Scala&#x27;s partial function/currying should hold here (i.e. when applying a single value x_i, return a function that is defined only for a subset of its input domain). For example, when n &#x3D; 2 define f(x, y) &#x3D; sin(x + y), then trivially, f(2, y) &#x3D; sin(2 + y).
  
However, the dimension (n &gt; 0) may vary from case to case and may even be provided in input. Partial application for n &#x3D; 2 is:
 def leftPartialFunction(f: (Double, Double) &#x3D;&gt; Double)(x: Double): Double &#x3D;&gt; Double &#x3D; f(x, _) 
 but how can this be generalized for arbitrary n?
 For example, how can I apply the function in position i?Something like this I assume would not work ...
 def partialFunction(f: IndexedSeq[Double] &#x3D;&gt; Double)(xi: Double): IndexedSeq[Double] &#x3D;&gt; Double &#x3D; .... // cannot work well with indexed seq as they are not &quot;disjoint&quot;

 TLDR: It’s a great resource for people looking to learn Haskell, but also how the real world around Haskell works. It left me feeling like I worked alongside an experienced Haskell programmer for a week, which I didn’t get from other learning resources. 10/10 would recommend it as it helped me onboard to the Wasp project nicely.
 For some context:
  
I’m a senior Web developer, and during my time in the industry, I’ve learned JavaScript well and a lot of the software development processes and best practices. I’m now starting to work with Haskell full-time.

                              <span>A common pattern I&#x27;ve found has been wanting to chain m (Maybe a)s, such as IO (Maybe a)s, or Parser (Maybe a)s (where a may differ at different points). The obvious way to me to do this would be
 (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;?) :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m (Maybe a) -&gt; (a -&gt; m (Maybe b)) -&gt; m (Maybe b) xm &gt;&gt;&#x3D;? f &#x3D; xm &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \case Just x -&gt; f x Nothing -&gt; pure Nothing 
 or use MaybeT like
 (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;?) :: Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m (Maybe a) -&gt; (a -&gt; m (Maybe b)) -&gt; m (Maybe b) xm &gt;&gt;&#x3D;? f &#x3D; runMaybeT $ do x &lt;- MaybeT xm MaybeT $ f x 
 but the pattern seems common enough that I feel like there would be a &quot;best practice&quot; or accepted way to do so, or some existing operator, that I&#x27;m unaware of. It also feels like there should be some way to generalize Maybe to any instance of MonadFail but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure that out.
 Is there a less verbose way of doing this, or are the two options above what I should stick with, or are there existing implementation(s) somewhere in some library/libraries that are accepted as the idiomatic way to do this?

                              <span>So emacs has mainlined eglot, it is apparently the future default emacs language server client. I tried switching over from lspmode to eglot, however it was missing the very helpful Haskell Language Server (HLS) type hints. The ones where you type a function without a signature, and it suggests, correctly most of the time, the most generic constraint or typing for what you are trying to do. Does anybody know how to get such behaviour with eglot/HLS?

My primary question is: how does /opt/ghc/_build/stage1/bin/js-unknown-ghcjs-ghc know to look at _build/stage1/.../rts-1.0.2/include/? Why does it not look in /opt/ghc/rts/include/?
 A minimal reproduction:

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else is using the Haskell Language Server + CoC + Vim, and how useful they&#x27;re finding it. To be honest, I&#x27;m finding it has only one advantage over ALE + Vim + the now defunct Intero – namely, it offers auto-completion – and has a number of drawbacks (no way to get a variable&#x27;s type, that I can see, and requires an entire Node.js installation). Is there some killer feature of HLS that I&#x27;m missing?
 tbh, most of what I&#x27;d want out of HLS can already be got from ghci (using the :type-at and :loc-at commands), so I&#x27;m thinking of writing a small Vim plugin to hook ghci into Vim similar to what Intero did.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Basically the title. When I execute the following code in a Julia repl, 
 a&#x3D;[0 0.5 0.5;0.75 0 0.25;0.75 0.25 0]; print(map(x-&gt;getindex(a^3,x),[1,4,7])) 
 I the definition for a is empty, as I&#x27;ve silenced the output with the semicolon.
 However, when I run this code from within org-mode, I get the following output: 
  #+RESULTS: : 3×3 Matrix{Float64}: : 0.0 0.5 0.5 : 0.75 0.0 0.25 : 0.75 0.25 0.0 : [0.1875, 0.40625, 0.40625] 
 That last row is the one I actually wanted to print, whereas the Matrix definition output should definitely not be there.
 I assume one of two things is happening: either org-mode is ignoring the semicolon when it executes the src block, resulting in this error, or julia is wigging out in the org-minibuffer since it&#x27;s not in a vterm (which apparently matters to julia for some reason).
 I&#x27;ve referred to the julia specific docs, as well as the org-mode evaluation of code blocks and results of code execution docs, with no solution. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I was just looking at something I&#x27;d written earlier in the week and noticed that org-mode had (somehow) changed a source code block I&#x27;d created from having the emojis I&#x27;d had in it (quite a few, which is how I noticed), to escaped numeric codes. I am unsure why this may have happened (and the fact is, I can add in the emojis but the file is a bit broke at the moment.
 Eg. 🐧 to \360\237\220\247 
 Is there any particular reason why this would have happened, and more to the point, is there a way to prevent it? (I should point out I&#x27;m on OSX and these were default emoji from Apple&#x27;s font.). It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve seen it happen in files (though I recently changed my config which, for example, removed the Apple emoji front from being defaulted.). I&#x27;m on emacs 29.0.60. Latest version of org-mode and using org-roam.

#recording #urbansketching #camera
To record timelapses of drawings, just use the camera with the left hand while you paint with the right and record a couple of seconds.
Paul Heaston (@paulheaston) shared on Instagram that he&#x27;s not using tools to hold his camera while he&#x27;s recording sketches most of the time instead of using a table mount.
Usually, he picks up the phone mid-sketch with the left hand, draws with the right, and records the drawing process for a couple of seconds only to capture something interesting on video. Finally, combine the clips into 1 video.</span>

                              <span>Guys hi, (crossposting with /r/orgmode for more replies)
 I need to 1) specify folder where all org-attach files will be stored, and 2) specify folder name per file. Basically i need
 OrgAttach/FileA OrgAttach/FileB etc 
 I did 1) by adidng this to init.el
 (setq org-attach-id-dir (substitute-in-file-name &quot;${SUPPL}/OrgAttach&quot;)) 
 And tried to do 2) by adding this to top of my file
 #+PROPERTY: ATTACH_DIR FileA #+PROPERTY: ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT t 
 It didn&#x27;t work, (seems they renamed ATTACH_DIR to DIR, and depreciated _INHERIT), tried 
 #+PROPERTY: DIR FileA 
 Still no luck, what am i doing wrong?

                              <span>Hello! I am advertising a package for writing LaTeX in emacs (alongside AUCTeX). It allows you to maintain a list of your favorite command definitions, and automatically inserts them into the file you&#x27;re editing when you use them.
 https://github.com/jojhelfer/cmdlist.el
 It has a few other related features as well.
 It has really improved my experience editing LaTeX in emacs, and I&#x27;m sure it would be useful to anyone who does so.
 Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m using eglot for coding c++, which is lightweight and provides just enough functionalities for me (Glad it&#x27;s integrated into emacs 29!)
 One thing I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied is the diagnostics when the cursor is hovering on a symbol. By default it shows the information in the echo area through eldoc, which is not quite convenient because usually it&#x27;s far from where the cursor is. A better solution is provided by eldoc-box, which shows information in a child frame, like this.
 As can be seen in the screenshot, the child frame blocks some part of the window. I&#x27;m wondering if possible to set the child frame transparent so that I can see the code below. I tried to set eldoc-box-frame-parameters with (alpha . 0.5) but it has no effect. What do I miss?
 Moreover, the eglot shows the information with some formatting. There is a long line separating different kinds of information, which is fine for the echo area, but in the child frame, it is wrapped into several pieces, occupying additional lines. I&#x27;m curious if there is a way to change the format. 
 Another question which is related is that the documentation is truncated. I&#x27;d rather to see a long child frame to show all the information, which is usually possible if there is no redundant things like the wrapped line. I cannot find an option in eglot to turn off the truncation. Is there any solution for this problem?
 Thanks for reading this long post!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m trying to setup my emacs to edit markdown files. Ideally I&#x27;d like to have links, emphasis, images, equations, etc. previewed inline when the point is not inside them, and displayed as raw source code when the point is inside them (the functionality provided in org-mode by org-appear and org-fragtog).
 Does anyone have a setup like this? I found this, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a solution that works per fragment instead of per line (and isn&#x27;t a &quot;quick and dirty proof of concept&quot;, as the author describes it).
 Thanks!
 edit: add links to org-appear and org-fragtog

                              <span>When Emacs 28 was about to come out, I remember John Wiegley said something like it took on average about 30 minutes for a user to natively compile it. Later on I also came across one online article saying it takes a lot more time to do native compilation.
 But according to my experience, on my mediocre desktop, it probably takes less than 10 minutes for native compilation. And I wonder if I&#x27;m doing it in a correct way. I run &#x60;./configure --with-native-compilation&#x60; then &#x60;make -j$(nproc)&#x60;. I also tried &#x60;make NATIVE_FULL_AOT&#x3D;1 -j$(nproc)&#x60; per EmacsWiki. But the compilation time is always very well under 10 minutes. After compilation, the evaluation of (native-comp-available-p) returns t.
 Am I doing it correctly or am I missing something?

                              <span>After a long time, I forked Melpa to create my TxGVNN/giaelpa@869cc17 to keep modifying packages for my configuration. I have time to consider using straight, borg. But now, I decided to using Guix to manage Emacs packages.
 Here TxGVNN/guxti is my Guix channel to maintain packages and patches.
 Pros
  
Patches are centrally stored, easy to see what is patch and don&#x27;t need to fork any source to modify.
 Reproducible, I can roll back any point (time traveling).
 It will be easy to install package need external libs like vterm, telega(Telegram client), tree-sitter,...
 Build your ELPA by elpa-mirror power tool. I exported to my giaelpa TxGVNN/giaelpa@master, so it still works well for my dotfiles without GUIX
 Keep working with use-package style.
 With guix pack --format&#x3D;deb I can install all of them (emacs version, packages, 3rd libs) on debian machine without GUIX
 When cloud IDEs are using more (Gitpod, Codespace), it helps me to a certain uniform environment. I implement on my Gitpod dotfiles, you can have a look TxGVNN/gitpod@701546
  
Cons
  
Heavy and slow, I think

                              <span>I want to make a sort of landing screen or dashboard for my emacs. I want it to be a vertically-displayed completing-read menu over some sources (recent files, recent buffers, bookmarks, etc.). I can write the completion command easily enough (and I already use vertico, so I would get the standard vertical display), but I want the completion candidates to fill the a whole window, a bit like vertico-buffer does. Importantly, I only want this to happen for this one thing -- the dashboard -- I don&#x27;t just want to enable vertico-buffer generally. If I switch to another buffer and invoke a minibuffer command, it should show up at the bottom like usual.
 It would be really great if invoking any minibuffer-using command while in the dashboard buffer would reuse the dashboard buffer for completion, but that might be a separate issue.

                              <span>I released version 29.1.3.0 of Compat, the Elisp forwards-compatibility library on GNU ELPA. This library may be interesting for you, if you want to use newer Emacs developments in your packages without breaking backward compatibility with older Emacs versions.
 Over time Emacs has seen useful standard library additions, for example additional string-* functions or the new keymap-* functions in Emacs 29. Compat provides many of these new functions and closes the gap between Emacs core development and package development outside of Emacs, since new Emacs additions become available early for all package developers.
 Packages outside of Emacs core can be written in the same style as Emacs core packages by relying on Compat. Vice versa Emacs core packages can use Compat for their separate GNU …</span>

                              <span>Hi fellas, I am trying to install the ejira, and I found it isn&#x27;t hosted on melpa yet. 
 I have two ideas to install this package:
  
git clone to one of the load-paths and just use-package. cons: I need install the dependencies first.
 use straight.el (maybe? I just start to read its long readme).
  
Then I find there is a ejira/ejira-pkg.el file in the repo, is that the package definations? Can I use this file directly to install the ejira with all its dependencies automaticly?

                              <span>Guys hi,
 I need to 1) specify folder where all org-attach files will be stored, and 2) specify folder name per file. Basically i need
 OrgAttach/FileA OrgAttach/FileB etc 
 I did 1) by adidng this to init.el
 (setq org-attach-id-dir (substitute-in-file-name &quot;${SUPPL}/OrgAttach&quot;)) 
 And tried to do 2) by adding this to top of my file
 #+PROPERTY: ATTACH_DIR FileA #+PROPERTY: ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT t 
 It didn&#x27;t work, (seems they renamed ATTACH_DIR to DIR, and depreciated _INHERIT), tried 
 #+PROPERTY: DIR FileA 
 Still no luck, what am i doing wrong?

 I use &quot;i-search&quot; to search in all org buffer, usually it works as expected. Today i needed to search headings only, so i M-x &quot;org-goto&quot;, and then searched needed header, then pressed C-g to close org-goto mini buffer and thought i am done. However now &quot;i-search&quot; searches only in headers... It&#x27;s as if org-goto changed the mode of &quot;i-search&quot; command. How to undo it? (and make i-search search in all buffer)

 I am not looking for a thorough monad implementation. Just something that would work for this case.

Is the following code the right direction to implement for-comprehension operations? If not, what should be the right way to implement for such purpose?

                              <span>Hi.
 I write a kind of &quot;slow start&quot; into the fs2-kafka: fs2-kafka introduction: deserialization with careful error handling
 The note is devoted to step-by-step deserialization with careful error management.
 I hope it will be helpful for somebody. And will appreciate any feedback.
 Thank you!

 As you might have noticed, this subreddit typically moderates with a light touch. The community guidelines encourage moderators to err on the side of leaving content in. 
 Those guidelines will remain in place. However the moderators here routinely get the same questions or take the same actions on certain types of posts or comments. In an effort to make those decisions more transparent and predictable, I have created a new set of rules for this subreddit. You should be able to see them in the sidebar and use them when reporting things to the moderators. I will copy them here for posterity:

 Greetings!
 Some time ago, I have started a series of tutorials dedicated to deep learning in Haskell.
 Now, I am about to finish this series. What would you rather read?

                              <span>In setting savehist-additional-variables I accidentally added a list and caused it to stop working properly.
 ie instead of being (a b c d e) I accidentally made it ((a b) a b c d e) and the problem was easily fixed by (setq savehist-additional-variables (cdr savehist-additional-variables)). However this was only possible because the(a b)&#x60; was the head of the list.
 The functions delete|remove, delq | remq remove an element from the list, with the former using equal to compare and the latter eq to compare.
 According to the docs equal 
  
Return t if two Lisp objects have similar structure and contents.
  
eq
  
Return t if the two args are the same Lisp object.
  
(delete &#x27;(a b) ((a b) a b c d e) works and (delq &#x27;(a b) ((a b) a b c d e)) doesn&#x27;t.
 Why do eq and equal treat the (a b)/&#x27;(a b) comparison differently?

                              <span>Hello! For some time I&#x27;ve been developing a package to integrate the TMSU file tagging system with Emacs and dired. While I find TMSU great, I didn&#x27;t really like its UI, so I&#x27;ve turned Emacs into a subjectively better one.
 https://github.com/vifon/tmsu.el
 While not a full replacement for more intricate TMSU CLI use cases, tmsu.el handles all the regular workflows such as tagging, tag modification and tag based queries (with results in dired, similar to M-x find-dired).
 It was one of my goals to integrate tmsu.el with the Emacs ecosystem as well as possible:
  
tag editing uses the standard completing-read-multiple (or any frontend to it, such as vertico)
 most dired features are usable in the query results
 the queries can be saved both with the Emacs-native bookmarks (C-x r m) and the org-mode links (M-x org-store-link)
  
Here is a screenshot of an example query made with M-x tmsu-dired-query:
 https://preview.redd.it/m3frsus24fda1.png?width&#x3D;936&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;v&#x3D;enabled&amp;s&#x3D;1bbe0270074bf8186bb416fb86c6529d3ba4d866
 tmsu.el was usable for quite a while, but only recently I&#x27;ve published it as a separate project (previously it was just living in my ~/.emacs.d/) and consider its feature set relatively complete and stable. Hopefully someone else will find it as useful as I do!
 Any further input is very appreciated.

 Need a slick, &quot;modern&quot; countdown timer for the Lunar New Year? Of course Emacs can do it! I&#x27;m working on a screencap. This package won&#x27;t be on any package repository soon, so use the install instructions for straight, elpaca etc.
 Also see the countdown package.
 I left some notes in the Elisp so you can figure out where to customize further.
 I&#x27;m also working on another &quot;game&quot; package that is similar to snow, but we will see if it&#x27;s time time for this Lunar New Year or has to wait until next NYE.

                              <span>I am a mathematics graduate student who has been dabbling with Emacs for a little under a year, on and off. I have the following use case, and I&#x27;ve felt a little overwhelmed at the possible choices of packages, so I&#x27;d like some advice on how to set up something that works for me.
 In my studies I often find myself encountering problems and ideas that I had thought about a long time ago, but can no longer reconstruct. What I&#x27;d like to create is a system where I can dash off my summary of a theorem or proof technique that I encounter, and be able to link these documents to each other. More specifically, I&#x27;d like to have a big folder filled with LaTeX files (or org files) that are tagged somehow so I don&#x27;t have to keep track of them myself. I want to be able to refer to specific theorems/definitions/equations in other files in the system, as I would in LaTeX. And, importantly, I want to be able to produce a nicely formatted PDF from a selection of these files, with all the internal links to equations, definitions etc. working properly. So for example if this semester I&#x27;m studying harmonic analysis, I want to produce notes on all the theorems and techniques I pick up, and by the end I should be able to stitch them together in a PDF. If next semester something I&#x27;m studying relies on one of those theorems, I want to still be able to point to the corresponding file and again include it in a different PDF. A nice plus would be the ability to smoothly manage citations and references to books, papers etc.
 There are packages in the so-called personal knowledge management ecosystem (org-roam, deft, org-brain, Zetteldeft etc.) that seem to do what I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;d appreciate anyone who&#x27;s tried out a bunch of them giving their opinion on what makes the most sense to do. If anyone&#x27;s done something similar, any advice, links or helpful blog posts describing your setup would be very appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using more and more org-agenda. But it would be really useful to have my tasks listed in my desktop. I thought about conky, but i still haven&#x27;t managed a way to make it work (beautifully)
 Since it&#x27;s really easy to export your agenda to a file, what conky is doing now is just reading the file where I export my default agenda view of the week. But I&#x27;ve encountered a few problems:
  
I would like to make the days of the week different colored, but since conky is just reading the file it&#x27;s not possible (at least I couldn&#x27;t do it, please tell me I&#x27;m wrong)
 The TODO and priority levels are really annoying (this is easier to deal with, but still)
 I have multiple files for different tasks. While I do want all the tasks to be listed and, when I&#x27;m on agenda view, from which file they come from, again, is really annoying on conky
  
Have any of you guys dealt with this before? How would you implement that?

                              <span>Hello, I was wondering if there is a better way to determine the directory location for an elisp script.
 When running as a script I used (file-name-directory load-file-name), but that is nil when running the file with eval-buffer etc.. So for those cases I use the default-directory variable. This is my current solution:
  (defun my/get-script-directory () (if (null load-file-name) (expand-file-name default-directory) (file-name-directory load-file-name)) 
 My main concern is that default-directory does not always point to the same directory that the file is in since it can be changed with cd. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m slightly confused by why if I write ((-cut + 2 ) 2) I get an Invalid function error but ((lambda (q) (+ 2 q)) 2) is totally fine. I know I need to add a funcall and I&#x27;d get that for places where I get passed a procedure from a variable or something but this is a macro. Those should get expanded before evaluation, so why if -cut expands to the exact same code does it behave differently in this case? And do ELisp macros have more quirks other lisps&#x27; don&#x27;t?

 #+title: Viterbi Algorithm [[idadasdasdfas | [viterbi]] is an algorithm 
 Now when I put the pointer to the most left position with my arrow keys, the pointer isn&#x27;t really left to the brackets, but somewhere in between and thus a SPACE would result in e.g.
 #+title: Viterbi Algorithm [[idadasdasdfas | [ viterbi]] is an algorithm 
 And not
 #+title: Viterbi Algorithm [[idadasdasdfas | [viterbi]] is an algorithm 
 How do you place the pointer at the left of a node link?

                              <span>Hi folks, been using emacs and Org Mode for a few years now. global-auto-revert-mode used to work fine -- if I changed a file remotely, the emacs process would pick it up and revert that file&#x27;s buffer.
 Around 6 months or so ago it became only &#x27;intermittently&#x27; working... maybe 1 out of 5 or 10 times, it will notice the file has changed and revert the buffer. Most of the time (almost always) it doesn&#x27;t. I find myself now doing &#x27;C-x x g&#x27; to revert by hand, before I start modifying my Org agenda, otherwise I&#x27;ll have a conflict when I try to save.
 I have this in my .emacs:
 &#x27;(global-auto-revert-mode t)
 I have also tried it with &#x27;1&#x27; instead of &#x27;t&#x27; but made no difference.
 My setup is:
 - Fedora 37 as a Virtualbox VM (running under a Windows 10 host)
 - emacs version 28.2
 - file in question is being synchronized via Syncthing (the remote device is an Android phone, as my main use case is Orgzly)
 I&#x27;ve done some searching but haven&#x27;t found an answer for this scenario so far. Can anyone give some pointers on what else I might look for, or any means of directly troubleshooting this?

                              <span>I see that a lot of people have moved into org mode, and say org mode is amazing as task management solution. So I&#x27;ve been convinced org mode is the ideal task management tool for geek.
 Then I discover that org mode miss some essential basic feature for task management. For instance, I estimated the effort for a project. After finishing some tasks, I try to track the remaining effort to complete the project. I discover that there is no straightforward solution to do that in org column view, org column view can only display estimated effort. I should write a custom function for this basic and essential feature of task management. No built-in solution or elisp package exists for that. Only a advanced emacs user (who masters elisp) can do this basic and essential action. I suppose probably that it exists maybe other basic and essential feature aren&#x27;t implemented in org mode.
 That make me to doubt when so many people says org mode is a amazing task management tool. Did they used really org mode in production for task management? I can&#x27;t understand how people can survive in task management without such feature.
 Org mode is maybe a good platform to build a task management tool, but it isn&#x27;t a mature task management tool.
 Fortunately,org can export to taskjuggler, I intent to explore the taskjuggler solution.

                              <span>Sorry for the newb question. For some reading, searching for this:
 tags &quot;TODO&#x3D;\&quot;TODO\&quot;+SCHEDULED\&quot;+PRIORITY&#x3D;\&quot;A\&quot;&quot;
 Is bringing up Todos with priority A, but also those with no priority. I can filter those no priority ones out with an org-agenda-skip-entry-if command (notregexp to drop anything that’s not explicitly [#A]) but that seems like it should be unnecessary.
 And then, I can’t figure out how to show anything due today/overdue with no priority in a separate search. What’s the best command for that?
 Any thoughts for me?
 —-SORT OF SOLVED—-
 I set the default priority to “D” (which is not one of the priorities I cycle through) and set up a search for that priority. Not sure if that’s the orthodox solution, but it works.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am looking for the functionality like a search box on this page: https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/search.html?q&#x3D;test&amp;check_keywords&#x3D;yes&amp;area&#x3D;default
 EDIT: both search or fuzzy search functionality will be great to have.
 EDIT2: I found org-info-js which is said to be outdated. 
 Ideally to be used across several subpages, beyond the way Read-The-Org simple wiki page layout. Use case: for knowledge base building, and quick access. I explain something to a co-worker and, using their computer, I can quickly search a topic I am explaining, and this topic is present on my website with my openly available notes.
 I could not see a search box in the pages generated from org to html.Someone said a few years ago that this required JavaScript to run, and that was not a feature of org to html conversion at a time.
 What are the solutions today?Thank you for your help and support. Please point me to right direction if I missed something obvious.
 Regards,Jakub

                              <span>For a small project I&#x27;ve been using servant to access the lichess API. I currently have something that more ore less looks like this (copied from the servant tutorial):
 manager&#x27;  :: ClientM Type) (mkClientEnv manager&#x27; ) 
 where  is some big tree like structure which needs many requests to build. The problem is that the lichess API is rate limited (here they say: only one request at a time and wait for a minute after receiving 429). Is there a way to slow down servant-client (or http-client) so that they obey these restrictions?
 I haven&#x27;t found anything in the docs of servant-client or http-client, and googling only gives result for the server side part. servant-rate-limit has a client module, but when you look at the code you see that it doesn&#x27;t do anything. managerConnCount and managerIdleConnectionCount don&#x27;t help either.

 In this post I’ll describe how to write a minimalistic Haskell persistence layer (on top of HDBC). My approach will rely heavily on Generics (Data.Data, Data.Typeable) and Reflection (Type.Reflection).
 The overall design goal is to avoid any boilerplate code for the API user.
 The library is by no means complete. Right now it’s just a proof of concept. But it shows that it is possible to use Generics to eliminate a lot of handwritten code for API users.
 I’m explicitely asking for your feedback here:
  
Do you regard such a persistence library as useful?
 Do you have any suggestions for improvements?
 Which feature would you like to see most urgently?
 Do you think it makes sense to extend this proof of concept to a full fledged solution, or are there already enough libraries out there that do the same?

                              <span>Trying out very simple example and playing with applicative and monad operators. So, the following code works:
 basic :: IO () basic &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;First Log&quot; *&gt; putStrLn &quot;Second Log&quot; &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (\_ -&gt; putStrLn &quot;Third Log&quot;) &gt;&gt; putStrLn &quot;End of program&quot; 
 But when I replace &gt;&gt; with *&gt; on the last line, it fails:
 basic3 :: IO () basic3 &#x3D; putStrLn &quot;First Log&quot; *&gt; putStrLn &quot;Second Log&quot; &gt;&gt;&#x3D; (\_ -&gt; putStrLn &quot;Third Log&quot;) *&gt; putStrLn &quot;End of program&quot; 
 The error is extremely confusing:
  
Couldn&#x27;t match expected type: () -&gt; IO ()
 with actual type: IO ()
 Possible cause: ‘(\&gt;)’ is applied to too many arguments*
 In the second argument of ‘(&gt;&gt;&#x3D;)’, namely
 ‘(\ _ -&gt; putStrLn &quot;Third Log&quot;) \&gt; putStrLn &quot;End of program&quot;’*
  
As far as I understand, &gt;&gt; comes from the Monad class while *&gt; is provided by the Applicative class and &gt;&gt; can always be replaced by *&gt;. Any suggestion what&#x27;s wrong here?

                              <span>Macbook air with G9 second monitor, and opening emacs onto the center of the big monitor:
 (setq default-frame-alist &#x27;((top + -334) (left + -3769) (width . 230) (height . 75))) (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 230 75) 
 The result is it pops from the laptop to the main monitor, but the height is clipped to the height of the laptop. And the minibuffer and modeline are gone/hidden, like the bottom of the frame is truly clipped. Any meaningful interaction in this state, like expanding an org headline, results in a crash/core dump.
 I need to drag the bottom a bit with the mouse to snap emacs out of it and get the minibuffer back and leave the crash-ready state.
 Executing the set-frame works fine when the frame is already on the second monitor, but i can recreate the same issue by moving the window to the laptop and executing the size and then dragging the window back.
 Anyone experience this? Ideas for a fix? Thankyou for any info.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I know org-mode is more complete than markdown, but I don&#x27;t need all the features of org-mode, so I prefer to use markdown.
 There are a lot of articles or tips to beautify org-mode on emacs, but not much on markdown. Maybe other users are like me, so I share a tip to beautify markdown titles in emacs (Doom emacs actually):

                              <span>Helm-Ag is wonderful.
 I would like to tell helm~ag to ignore showing files that have the extension &quot;.org_archive&quot;, and probably later also &quot;.html&quot;.
 Based off the sample configuration on the github readme...
 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(helm-ag-base-command &quot;ag --nocolor --nogroup --ignore-case&quot;) &#x27;(helm-ag-command-option &quot;--all-text&quot;) &#x27;(helm-ag-insert-at-point &#x27;symbol) &#x27;(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns &#x27;(&quot;\\.txt\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\.mkd\\&#x27;&quot;))) 
 ... I figured that that would require me to add the following to my emacs init.el file:
 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(helm-ag-ignore-buffer-patterns &#x27;(&quot;\\.org_archive\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\.html\\&#x27;&quot;)) &#x27;(helm-ag-ignore-patterns &#x27;(&quot;\\.org_archive\\&#x27;&quot; &quot;\\.html\\&#x27;&quot;)) ) 
 I probably don&#x27;t need both. However this doesn&#x27;t seem to be true. I.E. it doesn&#x27;t exclude those files, although I do see my customisations via customize-group.
 Can someone please tell me what I&#x27;m failing to understand?
 Thank you.

 I use consult and vertico. Sometimes, when moving down the list of buffers I get after calling consult-buffer, the following happens when point (in the mini buffer) is on the name of a buffer visiting an org file: As soon as the preview of the buffer is visible, the minibuffer is replaced with a temporary buffer in Fundamental mode containing just a string with the tags from one heading in the org file.
 I&#x27;ve tried bisecting my config to see what could be causing this. But since I cannot reproduce the behavior reliably, I&#x27;m never quite sure whether I&#x27;ve found the culprit or I simply haven&#x27;t run into the problem. My best guess at the moment is a little hook whic…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently trying to switch from Neovim (with a Neochad-based config) to a from-scratch Emacs. I&#x27;m pretty happy with my config, but I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the C-? and M-? way of doing things in Emacs. Since I employ Evil for everything, could I change to a ? based config to reduce stress on the finger joints. Ergonomics is very important to me. 
 I saw many plugins promising it, but I wondered what the right way of implementing this is. 
 Thanks for your help :)

                              <span>I am a junior self taught developer (for +- 2 years). Currently ending a 9 month front/back-end + python course. I like working with Django.
 I am currently intensely looking for my first job position as a developer where I will work with python and Django.
 My question is - should I mention in my CV and be proud of that I am using Emacs as my text/code-editor/note taking app/calendar/etc, because that will show, that I like to tweak things not only for work, but for my own pleasure, I don&#x27;t feel the need to use what everyone else is using, I like to understand the tools that I am using, I value efficiency(after using emacs for almost a few years, I can not imagine writing code and using my mouse or arrow keys often) and etc... 
 Or... it will show that I am weird for using some ancient editor and it&#x27;s going to be too hard to blend me in a team of other developers using vscode and stuff.
 Curious to know what you think.

                              <span>I have missed the discussion on Emacs is Not Enough that took place here not too long ago.
 First of all: I want to say thanks for that whole thread, I really enjoyed reading some of the feedback. There were some recurring questions and comments there, so I decided it best for me to address them all in one place.
 There I was also visually adviced to write an elevator pitch to quickly explain the central point (thanks, u/tonicinhibition). You can read that here now: Project Mage: The Elevator Pitch.
 And if you want a more detailed discussion and motivation for structural editing, there&#x27;s the Rune section here: The Power of Structure/Rune.
 So, let me address some points from the discussion thread:

                              <span>Hey, does someone know how to realize org-roam-capture-templates s.t. after entering p for the projects folder there is another dialog to choose between the directories projects/active and projects/done?
 Does M-x org-roam-capture-templates RET support to have a key to create directories?
 It would be good to have something like M-x org-roam-node-find RET p RET active RET paper RET, where p corresponds to some template and a projects directory.
 Now there is another problem, when one does
 mv projects/active/paper.org projects/done/paper.org 
 org-roam-node-find would not find paper.org. Edit: nevermind, had to org-roam-db-clear-all and org-roam-db-sync.
 TLDR how to have an org-roam-template choice with a recursive directory/filename choice? Found out, that I can move files in my org-roam-directory.

                              <span>So I was using neovim - but had some issues related to indentation that I couldn&#x27;t fix, and the community also seemed to agree that it was a known issue, and so I moved to using doom emacs.
 ​
 So I moved to doom emacs - tested the indentation, and it was flawless, exactly how I wanted it to perform.
 ​
 What I want, which was working:
 - If I open a block, auto indent ready for typing based on where the block currently is
 - If I delete all indentation in front of a line, and hit tab, autoindent that line to it&#x27;s correct indent level
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and hit backspace at the beginning of that line, remove 1 indentation (even if this would be incorrect to what is expected)
 - If I have a line indented correctly, and I tab at the beginning of the line, indent that line once (even if this would be incorrectly indented)
 ​
 This is pretty much exactly how VSCode handles indentation for PHP, it&#x27;s very practical and flexible.
 ​
 I want to know how I can get back to this, because today after opening my emacs, if I hit tab, the editor will just check if the line is correctly indented, and fix it as per it&#x27;s own opinion. 
 I do not want this aggressive style of controlling indentation, because it is not at all practical of what I actually need from emacs
 ​
 For context - I work on an eCommerce site, the entire project is 7 million lines of code, and not one single file has been well mantained - some of the files are 30 thousand lines long.
 ​
 Of course - one option would be to try and indent the entire file, but then I can&#x27;t get my PRs approved on GitHub.
 ​
 Accepting the aggressive indentation is not an option for me, I need to be able to have flexible control over it.
 ​
 Can anyone suggest ideas for this?

 Currently, C-h k is set to c-indent-line-or-region

                              <span>Hello friends of Emacs,
 many Emacs users don&#x27;t use eshell very much.
 Many users of other shells, are not familiar with eshell&#x27;s features and capabilities.
 On a Slovak Linux site a while ago I published an article about eshell, aimed at a wider audience who don&#x27;t use Emacs, and I mentioned some of the features that make it interesting and attractive.
 Maybe it makes sense for English-speaking users (of PC, Linux), so I made a translation of it (note: English is not my native language, so please forgive mistakes and awkward expressions).
 (BTW: I use eshell as a daily tool and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to another shell. )

This also happens when I run -h-r-r to reload the config, and it just keeps me in the buffer where the output of the prompt is. According to https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/3042 there might be some characters in the env file that are causing this issue, but I don know what env file are they talking about.
 Also, after install I had uncommented neotree in init.el but when trying to start neotree, I get the error Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, neotree

                              <span>Hello community,
 Of late, I do not know why, but the hard disk space on my Windows machine is close to being fully utilized. I notice that there are multiple apps that seem to be updating by default -- such as Acrobat reader, McAfee Software, Browser Updates, etc. 
 I am considering emacs and was wondering if emacs has this issue at all? I believe that there is a pdf reader built in, web browser built in, etc.
 So, hypothetically, if one were to install emacs, what other Windows applications can be removed -- Acrobat reader. Chrome / Microsoft Edge browser, etc.?
 What Windows applications are hard to replicate in emacs? Can people here tell me which Windows applications you still have to use after installing emacs?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Preface: This is not a complaint. I appreciate all of the work that has been done on Emacs and its docs over decades. I&#x27;m just trying to get a reality check on my perspective here...
 Is it just me or are the official Emacs docs not at all instructive? Ex: Child Frames. After reading that doc, I still don&#x27;t have the slightest idea how to create a child frame in elisp. I know all of the odd corner cases that might happen when trying though!
 Perhaps someone has a suggestion as to another resource which leans more heavily code and less heavily &quot;All The Corner Cases!&quot;

                              <span>NOTE: Please ignore the title. It is plain wrong
 I&#x27;m experimenting with defvar&#x27;s and realized that because it is a special function the symbol parameter can&#x27;t be computed.
 So I&#x27;m trying something like this in the scratch buffer:
  (defun that () &quot;newvalue&quot;) &#x60;(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 &quot;a docstring&quot;) 
 evaluation the second line results in
 (defvar newvalue 10 &quot;anothername&quot;) 
 which I want to execute directly.
 What command should I wrap around the defvar to execute it directly?
 I&#x27;m also looking the eval function which seems to be the way to execute valid elisp like the generated defvar above after it has been converted to a string.
 Can the same thing be done in an eval way?
 PS. After scratching my head a bit and remembering a few things such print being what you had to do to read stuff and chancing across some old stuff this is what I have come up with.
 (defun my/eval-string (string) &quot;Eval elisp code of STRING.&quot; (eval (car (read-from-string (format &quot;(progn %s)&quot; string))))) (my/eval-string (prin1-to-string &#x60;(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 &quot;another name&quot;))) 
 It works fine but isn&#x27;t there a simpler way? This seems convoluted.
 It must be possible to execute the expansion of &#x60;(defvar ,(make-symbol (that)) 10 &quot;another name&quot;) without converting it to string prefixed with progn, reading it and executing it again.

                              <span>Hi everyone! So, I know absolutely nothing about Haskell. All I know is a little Python, a little JavaScript, HTML and CSS. My boyfriend loves Haskell and he tried teaching it to me, but I got frustrated quickly and now he thinks I don’t have an interest in it. I want to surprise him by learning it and making a game in Haskell as a gift for his birthday in March. But I don’t know how Haskell works or if you can even use it for games. What advice do you guys have? Are there any videos or courses you guys recommend? Is making a game in Haskell even possible? Please feel free to infodump! I want to learn everything I possibly can!

 I also want to create a type:

 How do I define that Space is suppose to mean: text &quot; &quot;
 and that NoSpace is supposed to mean: text &quot;&quot;

 I have this class
 type DbQuery &#x3D; Text
 newtype DbConfig &#x3D; DbConfig { dbPath :: FilePath }
 class (Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; Db m where
 readDb :: DbQuery -&gt; m [a]
 writeDb :: DbQuery -&gt; m ()
 getConfig :: m DbConfig
 My aim was with it to read data from db use the readDb method and return with any type.
 I would like to determine the exact type where I create the instance of that class.
 the implementation:
 data DbRow &#x3D; DbRow Int Text deriving (Show)
 instance FromRow DbRow where
 fromRow &#x3D; DbRow  field  field
 instance Db IO where
 readDb queryStr &#x3D; do
 sqlitePath  getConfig
 conn  IO [a]
 at /home/lajbo/Projects/haskell-projects/test1/src/DbImpl.hs:17:3-8
 Please clarify what I dont&#x27; understand and why the DbRow is not Any type ...
 thanks for advance!

                              <span>Hello everybody.
 I sometimes accidentally create new captures with wrong inputs by mistake or choose the wrong template. I then try to abort the capture process (C-c C-k or org-capture-kill). Unfortunately, this still creates an empty file for that capture and performs a find-file on it. 
 I added :no-save t to my templates (inspired by this thread), but this makes aborted captures&#x27; buffers to stay open. Adding :kill-buffer t somehow causes org-capture to write the file to disk on abort (ignoring :no-save t). 
 Is there a way to not create an empty file and to close the capture buffer when aborting an org-capture process?

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m looking for a Scala counterpart to Haskell&#x27;s constructor sequential application, and it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to find a documentation page where this topic would be covered. Basically, I&#x27;m looking for a way to achieve this in Scala:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Object &#x3D; Object Int String deriving Show
 main &#x3D; print object where object &#x3D; Object  Just 1  Just &quot;one&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 If it isn&#x27;t supported by the core language, I&#x27;d appreciate links to libraries implementing this functionality via FP primitives.

                              <span>I&#x27;m evaluating scala3 for the type of applications I do (business logic in logistics, e-commerce) and I&#x27;m looking to scratch an itch I&#x27;ve been having with other languages and their ecosystems.
 First some definitions
  
a clean domain model is a package/module/layer which does not depend on anything but the language and itself
 no external libraries, in-line annotations (eg javadoc) or off-line annotations (eg xml) are allowed in the domain model
 the domain model can provide contracts that other models/modules can implement in order to pass data into the domain model; data can also be injected by constructing model entities outside of the model and passing them as parameters to the model
  
With all this in mind, I landed at the first candidate: slick from https://scala-slick.org/ that you all probably know.
 Given my requirements, I have an issue with the example on their front page
  class Coffees(tag: Tag) extends Table[Coffee](tag, &quot;COFFEES&quot;) { 
 because their abstraction requires me to pass into the model an abstraction specific to the library (a table), but I need to pass into the model the Coffee type defined above (supposedly defined in the domain model).
 Basically the extends gets in the way. I would envision my requirement being met if the slick abstractions would be mixins, and my class StorableCoffee would extend Coffee and mix into itself the storage features from slick.
 Then I would be able to pass into the domain model StorableCoffee, but to the model that would just be a Coffee.
 So since I&#x27;ve never coded in scala, my questions are:
  
is it possible to achieve my goal without convoluted scala3 artifacts and slick or another library?
 if not, what are the possible hacks I could employ?

 i tried finding a backend developer job in scala for almost 3 years and couldnt get one, so i wanted to shift gears and move towards big data using scala and see if that helps my career moving towards scala. 
 So the question is, Is Spark still relevant to learn in 2023 or should learn something relevant like flink ?

A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing that creates an interconnected web of thought. Its emphasis is on connection and not mere collection of ideas.

                              <span>It takes me about 20-30 minutes to create 1 Zettel sometimes because my linking process often involves sifting through my Slipbox to find the right note to place my note behind. As my Slipbox grows, it becomes cumbersome to keep this up.
I see plenty of posts share abstract advice for linking Zettels together and implementing Folgezettel.
Each link should create knowledge
Create a new Zettel when you&#x27;re starting to branch into a second idea
&quot;Find&quot; Zettels that match your topic (but don&#x27;t you dare use the Search function to do it!)
You need Folgezettel / you don&#x27;t need Folgezettel (I personally like the structure, so I&#x27;ve chosen to keep it)
What I&#x27;d like to learn from experienced users is this: What are the PHYSICAL steps you take when you&#x27;ve completed a Zettel and you&#x27;re linking it to your other Zettels?
By physical steps, I mean what you actually do, GTD-style Next Actions.
For instance, here&#x27;s my physical action steps.
Search my index for the topic of interest
Look within that cluster to find a Zettel that&#x27;s either a source of that idea or similar to that idea.
Number the new Zettel after the one I chose from #2.
Use the Obsidian search function for a few keywords within my Zettel to find relevant links, adding context phrases as I do so.
But the problem is that as my Slipbox grows, I&#x27;ll slowly forget the Zettel clusters and may make less-than-ideal connections. Any guidance here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</span>

Scholar and historian S.D. Goitein built and maintained a significant collection of over 27,000 notes in the form of a card index (or zettelkasten1) which he used to fuel his research and academic writing output in the mid to late twentieth century. The collection was arranged broadly by topical categories and followed in the commonplace book tradition though it was maintained on index cards. Uncommon to the space, his card index file was used by subsequent scholars for their own research and was ultimately digitized by the Princeton Geniza Project.
Introduction to S.D. Goitein and his work
Shelomo Dov Goitein (1900-1985) was a German-Jewish historian, ethnographer, educator, linguist, Orientalist, and Arabist who is best known for his research and work on the documents and fragme…</span>

What I&#x27;m Working On
I&#x27;ve fallen into a rabbit hole. I&#x27;m programming a ZK tool for The Archive that will bring notes together in a way that exposes their connecting ideas. Looking at the history of this project, it is something I&#x27;ve been working on and off again for a year, and it is so close to releasing into the wild, I&#x27;m having a hard time sleeping. We&#x27;ll see.
11 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
Titles and one-sentence summary/meaning of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I&#x27;m currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Here is my org-mode file foo.org:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vcount(@I..@II) 
 I place the point somewhere inside the 1st table and press C-c *. Nothing happens. This is good.
 Then I place the point somewhere inside the 2nd table and press C-c *. It gets misaligned like this:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vcount(@I..@II) 
 It looks like it mistakenly took a column width of 8 for the last row, 2nd column. I suspect that this column width of 8 has been mistakenly taken from the column width of the 2nd column of the first table which is also 8.
 Following my suspicion I try a different experiment now. I press TAB on the 2nd table to realign. Then I place point somewhere in the 1st table and type C-c * and now the 1st table gets misaligned like so:
 | Category | Points | |-----------+--------| | Minecraft | 13 | | Tetris | 6 | | Bricks | 1 | |-----------+--------| | | 20 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vsum(@I..@II) | Game | No | |--------+----| | Mario | 1 | | Pacman | 1 | | Zork | 1 | |--------+----| | | 3 | #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2&#x3D;vcount(@I..@II) 
 You see it has incorrectly set the column width of last row, 2nd column to 4 which is also the column width of 2nd column of 1st table.
 Is this expected behavior? Or is this a bug? Any workarounds to prevent this kind of misalignment from happening?

 Are there IDE&#x27;s features are you missing in Emacs?

                              <span>I have an org-mode file that looks like this:
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp (defun make-list () (list (list 10 20) (list 30 40) (list 50 60))) (make-list) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: | 10 | 20 | | 30 | 40 | | 50 | 60 | * Some section Some text in this section 
 In the example above make-list produces a static list but in my actual org-mode file this function creates a dynamic list based on current date and other current data.
 I want to set up my org file such that whenever I visit this file, it executes (make-list). How can I do it?
 I read about #+STARTUP: but it does not support executing arbitrary elisp code. So how can I modify my org file such that it always runs (make-list) on startup.

 Recently I&#x27;ve created a simple guitar fretboard cheatsheet for Emacs. I don&#x27;t know how many guitar beginners we have in the Emacs community, but maybe someone will find it useful. See the screenshot on Github to get the idea of what it does.
 Currently it depends on symbol-overlay.el for simplicity, but this dependency probably will be replaced with calls to highlight-regexp.
 Don&#x27;t hesitate to say what additional functionality would make sense, assuming it wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to add.

                              <span>as I understand it, doom emacs, spacemacs, prelude, this is vanilla emacs, in which a bunch of packages and a bunch of elisp code have been added, that is, no changes have been made that are not available in vanilla emacs, for example, changes to some low-level moments as in the same emacs-ng?

                              <span>Is there an easy way to have my orgmode agenda respect regular orgmode formatting, such as +thing+ being a strike-through format? Right now I can format the title and, though it looks decorated in the input view, it is unadorned in the agenda view and I just see the raw plus signs or other markups.

                              <span>Inspired by Nicolas Rougier&#x27;s mu4e-dashboard, I tried to create a similar dasboard for my org-agenda. The links in the dashboard open an agenda search window in the middle window, which by default shows a weekly agenda. This combined with the side window on the right (mostly taken from Rougier&#x27;s task agenda) makes for a rather nice setup, I believe.

                              <span>Hi,
 on two of my systems simply starting emacs seens to have resulted in packages being updated and that resulted in in the &quot;Invalid function: org-assert-version&#x60;, my installation is currently broken.
 The workaround seems to be to start emacs with -Q and reinstall org but I don&#x27;t know how to do that.
 I have tried (with emacs -Q) to configure the melpa-client but when I then try to run (package-install &#x27;org) it simply says &quot;org is already installed&quot;.
 How to proceed?
 Many thanks!

 I have followed this blog post in order to setup eglot for React + TS development and it works (almost) well and runs without errors, basic TS stuff is being detected, like imports, &#x27;any&#x27;, unused vars etc - however, eslint is not working at all. 
 I am new to Emacs so please if don&#x27;t lose patience if I make stupid mistakes. Thanks in advance!

I liked it so much that I created a video that shows some of the things it can do. The video is aimed at people that are just getting started. If you are interested take a look and tell me what you think. I am quite new to emacs and now I am exploring to see what will work for me. If you are using org mode please share what you find most useful in your daily use?

                              <span>I realize this may be largely a matter of personal taste but I&#x27;ve been using SF Pro on OSX for doom and now nano and realizing while it is a nice match for the system it&#x27;s caused me to make some goofs in writing due to things, like...well... not having serifs and the like. And large texts get somewhat fatiguing to scan vs serif fonts. 
 For people who are doing lots of writing in org-mode, particularly professional writers, bloggers, or scientists and who abuse proportional rather than fixed font, I&#x27;d be curious as to what people is working for people (and why).

                              <span>So I&#x27;m using eglot for almost all of my language server needs at the moment, everything is great, except for when I&#x27;m forced to do react and or react-native.
 It just seems to completely hang and freeze for more than a handful of seconds, is there any configuration that someone has to make it nicer/not do it at all?
 ​
 I&#x27;m not including any configuration in this, coz there isn&#x27;t any at all.

                              <span>Is there any reason why aeson uses lazy ByteString instead of Text or strict ByteString? I am referring to the encode function defined as:
 import Data.Aeson import Data.ByteString.Lazy (ByteString) encode :: ToJSON a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; ByteString 
 I read many articles specifying that lazy Text and lazy ByteString are not to be used or should be used in very few specific situations. So, what advantage does it bring for aeson to use lazy version?
 Also, as far as I know ByteString is binary data, so when aeson encodes the some record to a JSON string, how does it know that it should use UTF-8 instead of something else? Is it the default behavior? Is there some way I can specify the character encoding behavior when using aeson for decoding and encoding a record?

 I&#x27;m a university student, and am out and about more than I am home, lately, and at times, when I want to play with an idea, or practice some concepts, I typically have to wait until I&#x27;m home to open up a project specifically for that purpose.
 I&#x27;ve looked around, but haven&#x27;t found anything regarding whether or not it is possible to use codespaces for Haskell. 
 Does anyone know whether it is possible? Additionally, does anyone have a repo I can clone for this purpose, or a resource to explain the setup?
 Thanks, all!
 Edit: my main issue is that I require ghcup, and the extension in vscode doesn&#x27;t work like it normally would out if the box.

                              <span>I have posted a message about this subject. But people recommend me to post in r/plaintextaccounting. But I think the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve is more of an org task management system&#x27;s problem than an accounting problem, and this feature is essential to a task management system. Maybe the idea is not well formulated. So I rewrote the post to better explain my idea.
 Core idea
 In org, The TODO keyword expresses an expectation (we want realize something); when it changes to DONE, the expectation is met. But the org mode does not have the concept of whether we have enough resources to achieve the expectation and how to consistently allocate them. In tasks management, I think budgeting a project, and analyzing its feasibility and cost, task allocation is essential.

I liked it so much that I created a video that shows some of the things it can do. The video is aimed at people that are just getting started. If you are interested take a look and tell me what you think. I am quite new to emacs and now I am exploring to see what will work for me. What do you find most useful in your daily use?

                              <span>i’m apart of a pretty massive staff augmentation program for a Fortune 100 company, and we have so many w2 development long term contract positions (all with this company, over 200+). Many are hybrid all across the US (2-3 days) or 100% remote and multi-year. we often get Scala requests across the US, and we struggle to find these folks on job boards. if you or anyone recently laid off is looking (in really any dev tech as long they have 1-2 yrs hands on), please send a pm. 
 Rates - from $45/hr w2( VERY junior) up to $100/hr w2 depending on the seniority level of the role. 
 The projects are cool, a lot of one and done interviews, but so many fraudulent candidates out there its hard to find the folks actually in need of work right now online. 
 if not allowed, my bad!

                              <span>Tweagers have an engineering mantra — Functional. Typed. Immutable. —
that begets composable software which can be reasoned about and avails
itself to static analysis. These are all “good things” for building
robust software, which inevitably lead us to using languages such as
Haskell, OCaml and Rust. However, it would be remiss of us to snub
languages that don’t enforce the same disciplines, but are nonetheless
popular choices in industry. Ivory towers are lonely places, after all.
Last time I wrote about how Python’s1 type system
and syntax is now flexible enough to represent and utilise algebraic
data types ergonomically. Here, I’ll develop that idea further by way of
a motivating example, for which I shall make use of some functional
programming “tricks” to arrive at an efficient Pytho…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to understand something about elisp that I have now struggled with for days and simpy cannot figure out - so I hope for some wizzard here...
 This is part of my configuration (it&#x27; about replacing the language-names of source-blocks with svgs - but that is not what this posting is about):
 (setq svg-tag-tags &#x27;( (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ) ) 
 As you can see the lambda expression for the languages is exactly the same in both cases, so I wondered if it was possible to factor that out and try something like this:
 ​
  (fset #&#x27;mh/myl (lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)) (setq svg-tag-tags &#x27;( (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(python\\)&quot; . (#&#x27;mh/myl) ) ) 
 So the idea is to store the lambda in the function-slot of a symbol and then use that symbol instead of the lambda but for reasons that are beyond me it does not work. (If it worked for python you would of course use this approach for all the other languages as well and then would only need to update one place should you ever want to change the appearence of the svgs).
 I have tried every conceivable permutation of quoting (or not quoting), of sprinkling in some call to symbol-function etc but I cannot make it work. Some variations compile fine but in the end none of them work.
 And I wonder: Why does this not work? What is it that I do not understand about symbols and lambdas?
 And what would be the proper way to do that (provided it is possible at all)?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I noticed a difference between cider eval last sexp and the default function and i&#x27;m wondering if this is intentional
 in elisp if I have &#x27;(+ 1 1)&#x27; and i have the cursor on the last &#x27;)&#x27; C-xC-e will give me 2.
 however in cider running eval last sexp on the ending &#x27;)&#x27; will only evaluate the sexp one char to the left of the &#x27;)&#x27;, in this case 1. to get it to eval 2 I&#x27;d need to jump one char to the right with my cursor, ie outside of the &#x27;)&#x27;, is this intentional?

                              <span>Caffine is a program to keep screen on, e.g., to disable screen saver. It never worked nicely for me. So I finally did a bit of research and wrote the following elisp script to toggle screen saver using the xset command. Placing it here incase its of use to others.
 (defun jds/toggle-caffeine () &quot;Toggle screen to stay awake versus allow screensaver.&quot; (interactive) (save-match-data (let* ((settings (shell-command-to-string &quot;xset q&quot;)) (_ (string-match &quot;DPMS is \\(\\w+\\)&quot; settings))) (pcase (match-string 1 settings) (&quot;Disabled&quot; (progn (shell-command &quot;xset s on\nxset +dpms&quot;) (message &quot;Can&#x27;t keep.. eyes... open....&quot;))) (&quot;Enabled&quot; (progn (shell-command &quot;xset s off\nxset -dpms&quot;)) (message &quot;We going to RAGE!&quot;))))))

 I use org mode for task management. I have just discovered accounting with Beancount (a awesome plain text accounting tool), with emacs support
 An accounting system is used to analyze our wealth. wealth is a resource that we have that allows us to exchange against something we want (time, money are wealth).
 I wonder if it is possible to use an accounting system to analyze the tasks of org mode.
 For instance, Paul and David work in a building company. they have 10 hour working time, and 100 EUR, and they should build a home. I list all step to build a home &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hi !
 I&#x27;m looking for a library to read / write on any process memory in Scala.
 In node, we have &quot;memoryjs&quot; (https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoryjs) for example that does that rather easily (drop a package.json with one dependecy, and you are up and running !).
 Is there any librabry available that can do that in Scala (I&#x27;ve juste spent one hour searching on the net without success ...) ? Thanks ! :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a CLAP audio plugin host for Haskell and running into issues when trying to use the C FFI on Windows. The same code works on Linux, so I&#x27;m assuming this is a longstanding Windows issue given all the warnings I&#x27;ve seen about using Haskell on Windows. And the same thing happens on every GHC version I&#x27;ve tried (8.8.4, 8.10.7, 9.2.5, and 9.4.4).
 The error message is &#x60;Access violation in generated code when executing data at 0x7ffd3aa06366&#x60; with a stack trace that points to an invocation of a method inside a struct field. The weird thing is that if I call the same method in the same Haskell function that the struct is created, it works fine. Which makes it sound like the struct got destroyed or relocated in memory. But if I print the C struct&#x27;s address and the address of all of its method field, they&#x27;re exactly the same as when it was created.
 My first thought was that the garbage collector had freed up its space, but that shouldn&#x27;t be possible since there is a persistent reference to the struct stored in an &#x60;IORef&#x60;. And using &#x60;StablePtr&#x60; didn&#x27;t have any impact.
 Anyone run into something like this before, or have better ideas how to debug it? And if not, where would be a better place to report this issue?

                              <span>Google Summer of Code is a long-running program by Google that supports Open Source projects. Haskell has taken part in this program almost since it&#x27;s inception!
 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.
 You can find more info and instructions on how to participate here: https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html.

                              <span>So, after working through &quot;Haskell from First Principles&quot;, I felt confident enough to try writing a BF interpreter. I could implement most instructions, namely: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  increase memory pointer
 + increase cell value currently pointed at
 - decrease cell value currently pointed at
 , get char and write value to cell currently pointed at
 . print char from cell currently pointed at &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 without problem, but when trying to implement the loops I got stuck, more specifically, when handling nested loops and the accumulated instructions (one-layer loops are executed correctly at the moment). 
 Basically what I did is the following (sorry if it is too much, thank you for reading this post):

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell with the dream of developing beatiful functional models. I&#x27;ve gone through the exercise of models from scratch. I am now interested in porting over some of my deep learning models from PyTorch. For this to work, I would want automatic differentiation and GPU execution. I&#x27;ve peeked at Hasktorch and the Tensorflow Haskell bindings, but I&#x27;m really interested in the slick interface of the backprop package. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a viable path given the repo has posted issues regarding GHC 9.0 and accelerate compatibility. Does anyone have recent experience with backprop and accelerate? Are there alternative recommendations for automatic differentiation?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on the Book of Monads by Alejandro Serrano Mena. One of the exercises from the book:
  
Exercise 7.1. Write the Functor and Monad instances for Either e. By convention, a successful return value is encoded by Right.
  
My implementation following the other examples in the book:
 data Either e r &#x3D; Left e | Right r instance Functor (Either e) where -- fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b fmap _ (Left x) &#x3D; Left x fmap f (Right x) &#x3D; Right (f x) instance Applicative (Either e) where -- pure :: a -&gt; f a pure &#x3D; Right -- () :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b Right f  Right x &#x3D; Right (f x) _  Left x &#x3D; Left x instance Monad (Either e) where -- return :: a -&gt; m a return &#x3D; pure -- (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b Right x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; f x Left x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; _ &#x3D; Left x 
 But I don&#x27;t understand why the instances are defined using only one type e where the constructor has two types, e and r.

                              <span>I created an example repository. I&#x27;m aware of tricks such as this one. But I find it really hard to avoid the increasing right indentation without making the code hard to understand because of runExceptT and the likes everywhere. To give you a bit more info before clicking the repository link: in the actual app, m would be the application monad (think ReaderT pattern), and so you might often see m (Maybe String) or m (Either String) being returned. It&#x27;s then hard to compose two functions like that. I&#x27;m aware that you can do MonadPlus m and MonadError String m but I can&#x27;t get this to work while still preserving the error messages depending on where I got a Nothing value.

 Written in Vanilla JS, generation happens entirely in browser.
 Automatically adds some default faces for few Emacs packages.
 Vim version also comes with 256 color support for terminals.
 Feedback is much appreciated.

[a]ll recipients
 [l]ist only
 [s]ender-only
  
What&#x27;s missing is the option to reply to the address defined in the original mail&#x27;s &quot;reply-to&quot; header.
 How do I get mu4e to respect that important header field?

                              <span>Xeft is a note searcher like Deft, with less features but much faster, especially for larger note collections. It uses a dynamic module to index your notes and provide search results.
 It has been around for a while now. I initially planned to extend Deft to use the dynamic module as a backend and keep Xeft to myself, but it turns out there are too many Deft features that I can&#x27;t make to work with the dynamic module backend. I still think this is really cool and want to share it, so I made Xeft publicly available on ELPA.
 In particular, I think it&#x27;ll work pretty well with Denote.
 I hope someone will find the dynamic module useful and come up with cool use cases for it beyond Xeft.

 Dynamic module: https://git.sr.ht/~casouri/xapian-lite

 A demo
 Q: Why not org-roam/rg/etc?
 A: Because they don&#x27;t fit my bill. If you use Deft but it lags, try Xeft, otherwise stick with what works for you.

                              <span>I noticed on this post mention of Meta decommissioning Sigma, their spam fighting tool, which is written in Haskell.
 If true, this news is very bad, since it&#x27;s an example of a major corporation we can no longer point to and say, &#x27;See! Haskell is used in industry!&#x27; And it&#x27;s quite likely I&#x27;ll have to write more weakly typed PHP and JS code, as a result as clients will refuse to take Haskell seriously.
 So does anyone know if this is true? Does anyone have any links?
 Apologies for making a new post about this, I didn&#x27;t get to comment on the other one in a timely manner.

                              <span>My ~/.stack is like 55 GB now.
 I see most of its contents are 1. GHC versions, 2. gzipped GHC versions 3. compiled Stackage snapshots
 Let&#x27;s say I can trade time with space at this point; what&#x27;s a good place to start deleting? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the second part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part02ConcurrentSMTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced state machine testing building only upon QuickCheck.
 In this part we will build upon the first part and add concurrent state machine testing support and linearisability checking (same technique as used by Erlang&#x27;s closed source quickcheck eqc and Jepsen.
 I hope to announce part three on integration and contract testing next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

Complete code or minimizations would be the best, but describing them and sharing your thoughts would help us well - what might have caused them, which files took the longest to compile, and how did you address them (if you managed to).

                              <span>Hello everyone, big announcement today for the scala community! 🎉
 Until now, the Tour of Scala repo has always been open source (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala) but only regarding the design. The articles were hosted on my own website and just displayed differently on Tour of Scala but not editable by anyone.
 As of today, all the content is also open source!
 💻 Every exercises can be edited by opening a PR on those files (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala/tree/main/pages/scala)
 I am looking forward to seeing everyone involved in this community fixing minor mistakes that I could have let slip in, adding more content, adding exercises for Scala 3, for ZIO, and more challenges, and adding new features! 🎉
 As a reminder, the Tour of Scala website: https://tourofscala.com

 Everything seems to match up pretty well with python in one way or another. Really impressed.

                              <span>Here is a blog post Fail with class that has a twofold purpose:
  
It describes a fairly common problem of trying to get a value gracefully from a monadic action that is restricted to MonadFail
 It introduces a new FailT library that provides a good solution to the above problem
  
Please let me know of other libraries that improve usability of MonadFail type class. Also I&#x27;d be very happy to get some feedback on the FailT implementation and design choices.

                              <span>More specifically, about (Flip x)&#x27;s in Flip&#x27;s Functor instance:
 haskell instance Functor (Flip x) where fmap g s &#x3D; case s of Flip (Left a) -&gt; Flip (Left (g a)) Flip (Right x) -&gt; Flip (Right x) 
 This is from A Type of Programming, and I know that this is only a stepping stone to introducing bimap and Bifunctor to achieve the same thing, but just can&#x27;t wrap my head around it.
 I know that Flip has kind *-&gt;*-&gt;*, just as Either, but I also don&#x27;t get how the flipping actually happens. Also, how do we even get that kind signature from this definition?
 haskell data Flip b a &#x3D; Flip (Either a b) 
 I get that the type variables are flipped so should I simply imagine that (Right 7) :: (Either a Int) can be perceived as
  (something not chosen |) Right 7 
 and Flip (Right 7) :: (Flip Int a) as
  Right 7 (| something not chosen)  ?
 Probably overthinking this whole lot...

 Reflex and miso are currently not on stackage and stack gave up on ghcjs a while ago. My dream would be to build a reflex or miso app in a simple and straightforward manner with stack.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have learned to create svg programmatically in emacs and when you do that you get some sort of data-structure that represents the xml that a svg is made of and one can feed that into svg-tag-mode, fine.
 But what I cannot figure out is how to read an existing svg-file into an elisp-variable: I mean not as the raw xml-content but the parsed data-structure that is used to represent it.
 Is that possible? Does anybody know how? 
 I can&#x27;t find any docs or examples...
 Many thanks!

I&#x27;ve not found anything in the docs nor in the elfeed code that suggests I could change the behavior to, say, only update the elfeed-search window after hitting . 
 thx

Please refer to the Perspective documentation for further information (https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el).

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to get svg-tag-mode to use a previously created svg and can neither make sense of the documentation nor find example code anywhere...
 The documentation says:
 You need first to set svg-tag-tags that is a list of item here each item has the form (KEYWORD (TAG COMMAND HELP)) where: .... TAG is either a SVG image that will be displayed using the &#x27;display property or a function that accepts a unique string argument (match-string 1) and returns an SVG image. 
 The second part about the function in TAG is clear and that is what all of the examples use.
 But what does &quot; a SVG image that will be displayed using the &#x27;display property&quot; mean?
 Assuming mysvg is a variable holding an svg I would have guessed that it should be one of this variants but none work:
 (setq svg-tag-tags &#x27;( (&quot;PATTERN1&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (mysvg)))) (&quot;PATTERN2&quot; . (&#x27;display mysvg)) (&quot;PATTERN3&quot; . mysvg) ) ) 
 Here is the code for mysvg:
  (setq mysvg (svg-create 80 80 :stroke-width 5)) (svg-circle mysvg 40 40 25 :stroke-color &quot;red&quot;) 
 So how is that supposed to work - does anybody understand this?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>As a good emacs citizen I&#x27;ve been delving deeper and deeper into integrating emacs to my tasks. Fiddling with some basic elisp (not a programmer) I could facilitate a lot of repetitive stuff I got to do in my masters and in my professional work. It&#x27;s beautiful.
 Now, there&#x27;s another thing I would like to do. As a masters student, it&#x27;s important to always check a lot of websites from the government and research institutions to look for opportunities. There might be some useful notice about a financial support, or a important upcoming event etc. Looking for these, I have to manually check at least a couple dozen websites weekly, and I&#x27;m getting tired of doing all this work manually. It usually goes like this: copy a link from a list, paste into the browser, leading to a news page from some research institution, check if there&#x27;s a new entry, go to the next link...
 Does anyone have a cool idea of how this could be done more easily? I thought about RSS feeds, but a lot of the websites don&#x27;t have them. Also thought about doing some scripting with EWW, in a way that it goes jumping around a given list of websites so that at least I can speed up all the checking. It would also be really cool if there&#x27;s a way to check if a given link has changed overtime, maybe by downloading the html&#x27;s to a temp directory and comparing the files?
 Either way, it&#x27;s something that would be really useful for years and years to come. Does anyone have a suggestion?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at the possibility of a massive change in my position at work. Long and short I&#x27;ll be traveling, A LOT, if I get this position.
 I primarily use a laptop at work (my personal laptop) and run org mode with my notes, todos, and schedule here.
 ​
 Given the travel I might be facing, I&#x27;m looking at getting a tablet. I&#x27;ve only really got a few requirements in mind as a whole. Mostly I want to be able to consume movies, books, reading, etc. But mostly I&#x27;ll be working with it as well. 
 I&#x27;m hesitant to go back to an i-pad for one primary reason. Mostly I&#x27;m more secure conscious these days and I prefer plain text where ever possible and self hosted everywhere else. 
 ​
 Android isn&#x27;t much better on the security front, but I&#x27;m heavily considering it. I do currently use an iPhone, though…</span>

                              <span>Hey Guys, I wanted to create a project recently in scala which I had to face user authorisation/authentication requirements. I found out that there wasn&#x27;t any library in scala written yet fitting my needs. So, I decided to create my library. I am new when it comes to libraries and I would I like to share it here for you, if anyone is interested to give feedback, maintain and use it as they like. andrewrigas/oath (github.com)

                              <span>Hi,
 many modes (let&#x27;s take rainbow-mode as an example) can be toggeled by calling the function that turned it on again. So in M-x I can toggle rainbow by calling (rainbow-mode) again and again.
 Now let&#x27;s say I want to do that via a keybinding.
 I have this function in my config:
 (defun mh/toggle () (interactive) (message &quot;here&quot;) (rainbow-mode) ) 
 And have bound this function to a key. When I press the key I can see the message written - so it gets called, however the rainbow-mode is not toggeled. 
 I have also tried to run (rainbow-mode nil) to turn it off from the function but that does not work either. I have also tried some construction with &quot;with-current-buffer&quot;, all to no avail...
 So why is that? What is the proper way to do such manipulations from a function?
 Please note that this is not about rainbow-mode as such (I just use it as an example) but it&#x27;s about functions in elisp.
 Many thanks!

 Select one of the safe coding systems listed below, or cancel the writing with C-g and edit the buffer to remove or modify the problematic characters, or specify any other coding system (and risk losing the problematic characters).

 I am using vertico-posframe to show the completion window at the top center. However, I would like that the background to be darker than the default background color. I tried many things to change this color (customize vertico-posframe face, pass the option background-color to posframe, etc.), but I did no succeed.
 Can anyone help me?

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the release of Kele 0.2.0. Changelog is viewable here.
 This release&#x27;s marquee feature is kele-get, Kele&#x27;s answer to kubectl get. With kele-get you can interactively specify the kind and name of the resource that you&#x27;d like to get and display its manifest in a separate buffer. What&#x27;s more, it supports custom resources right out the gate -- a long-standing functionality gap in kubernetes-el (for which I&#x27;m a co-maintainer so pardon the candor).
 GIF time!
 See How-Tos &gt; Usage &gt; Working with Resources in the Kele documentation for more details. It&#x27;s very much an MVP so there are some rough edges. Please open an issue for any peculiar behavior that you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you wanna chat or throw ideas around.

 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook org-mode) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode)) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode . rainbow-mode)) 
 As far as I understand the documentation they should all be equivalent and should turn rainbow-mode on in org. 
 But they don&#x27;t. None of these versions work at the moment. No error, just no rainbow-mode (I can turn it on manually without problem).
 But here is my problem: They did work yesterday. 
 I have not changed anything about rainbow-mode but I must have changed something else that seems to have a side effect.
 This is driving me crazy now, I don&#x27;t care about rainbow mode at all - all I want is to understand what is going on here...
 I am new to emacs and have no clue on how to attack this - does anyone have an idea?
 My config is an org-file that gets tangled when it&#x27;s written but this mechanism seems to work ok, the generated el-file is in sync with the org...
 I would be grateful for every tip.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Right now, the buffer for org-roam-node-find lists only the title and tags. I&#x27;m trying to add the create date of the node to this list as well. After reading high and low, this is as close as I&#x27;ve gotten:
 (cl-defmethod org-roam-node-date ((node org-roam-node)) (org-roam-node-file-mtime node))
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template &quot;${title:*} ${date} ${tags}&quot;)
 When I do this I get &quot;wrong type argument: sequencep, xxxxx&quot; when trying to find or insert a node.
 Any ideas on how I can make this work?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Just wanted to share some quick updates about my work. HVM has been receiving continuous updates, and is on 1.0.0 now. The parallelism is greatly improved and more general, there are several stability improvements, and it is faster than ever. Kind, the dependently typed programming language, keeps evolving. Kindelia, which was a currency-less p2p computer based on HVM that I never officially announced, has been paused to let me focus on HVM and Kind, but will be resumed in the future.
 I&#x27;m so positive and enthusiastic about the future of HVM that I believe it must have a much bigger team to thrive. With that in mind, I&#x27;m launching a tech startup - the Higher Order Company - which will focus entirely on pushing HVM to the next level, building valuable products around it, and paving the way …</span>

Therefore I would love to hear what others use / recommend!
 I am really looking for the most standard solution.

                              <span>After reading Chris Okasaki&#x27;s Purely Functional Data Structures, and understanding how to analyze functional data structures (admittedly a re-read might be necessary to fully understand), I ask how to do the same for Monads? The question really came to mind from the debates made between using mtl or other effects systems, where people reiterate that the problem with mtl is the O(n2) instances. I apologize in advance for any incoherency in my question!

 This feels intuitive but it is not especially when it streaming of the data using lazy bytes as explained here in the same video. And, then it concludes that the Application type is actually of:
 type Application &#x3D; Request -&gt; (Response -&gt; IO ResponseReceived) -&gt; IO ResponseReceived 
 What I don&#x27;t understand is how lazy Bytestring works! Where the the back-pressure is in the lazy part? And, why does the file handle gets closed before sending the response? The sample code from the video is:
 type SimpleApp &#x3D; Request -&gt; IO Response simpleRun :: Int -&gt; SimpleApp -&gt; IO () main &#x3D; simpleRun 8000 $ \request -&gt; withBinaryFile &quot;big-file.csv&quot; ReadMode $ \h -&gt; do lbs &lt;- BL.hGetContents h pure $ responseLBS status200 [(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;text/csv; charset&#x3D;utf-8&quot;)] lbs 
 So, isn&#x27;t the Bytestream being fed at lbs &lt;- BL.hGetContents h line and then used at the very last line? The function withBinaryFile is being called in the callback function and that would wait till the response is sent at pure $ ... line, won&#x27;t it?
 Any conceptual model I can imagine to better understand and visualize this?

                              <span>I just watched a video talk of John De Goes and I liked it very much. It was from 10 months ago. There were perhaps a couple of things missing or which could be presented in another talk to complement this one, but this one is excellent.
 A big part at the beginning would seem elementary to some people, but his way of introducing FP and OOP and how they differ could be very useful to other viewers.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9hAcW2oMl6M
 Other videos and books I&#x27;ve been reading discuss FP fundamentals which are distinctly different than OOP practices and it would be helpful to see how &quot;effects free&quot; and &quot;invariable data&quot; would best be incorporated into that list of Best Practices. Getting a fuller inclusion of strong FP ideas would help even the OOP methods to be better and for more …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning org mode and this year is the ear I want to fully dump my notion based system and migrate into org-mode. Most things I have figured out how to solve but I wanted to get a temperature check on how best to save myself duplicate data entry as I manage my daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews. 
 The Goal
 Each day I will use org-roam daily capture template to generate a form with two main sections: 
  
Morning Stack
 Evening Stack
  
These will be largely data capture and routine outlines for myself. I&#x27;ll likely utilize a &#x27;metric&#x27; capture with gnuplot for things like my weight, sleep rating, mood etc. Direct links to my repeated routines i.e. mindset, gratitude type stuff. 
 In Notion I currently will use the relational database system to have each thing nested and rolled into each other so for example my weekly review has each of the 7 days of that week linked into it and I use a database roll up to grab the data entries for easy review that week. 
 In this at the end of each week I have a baseline of information of what happened that week ready to review, it also has some of its own higher level routines &amp; processes built in there too. 
 I&#x27;ve considered using org-refile copy but its a little bit more of a manual process. I&#x27;m thinking some of that might be able to be automated either through some elisp or macros. However, before I go through doing all of that I figured I&#x27;d ask here for any insight since many of you are much more familiar with org and its tricks than I am.
 Ultimately I want to roll from daily into annual. (Daily -&gt; Weekly -&gt; Monthly -&gt; Quarterly -&gt; Annually)

                              <span>Been reading through this article https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html. It&#x27;s not lost on me that it&#x27;s a bit old but I&#x27;ve failed to figure out any solution to a question I had.
 ​
 I had to make an adjustment to the capture template as it was creating each new TODO in as a sub-level of tasks.
 (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;t&quot; &quot;Todo [inbox]&quot; entry (file &quot;~/org/gtd/inbox.org&quot;) &quot;* TODO %i%?&quot;) (&quot;T&quot; &quot;Tickler&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/gtd/tickler.org&quot; &quot;Tickler&quot;) &quot;* %i%? \n %U&quot;))) 
 Now I&#x27;ve working through refile and I&#x27;ve noticed that refile only allows me to move the current item to a sub-item in the existing defined file. This makes sense in some cases, however, I think it&#x27;d be more useful to be able to create new top level headings in the gtd.org file. Say a new project emerges is one case....
 ​
 I have tried change the max level setting, to no avail as well as setting 
 org-outline-path-complete-in-steps 
 which did appear to work at first, but this was unsuccessful as well. 
 ​
 So I&#x27;m curious, am I thinking about this the wrong way (as a general practice in org-mode... ) or have a messed up some settings here.
 ​
 I&#x27;ll add that I&#x27;m completely open to advice in org mode and even my GTD process (I&#x27;m new to both.... although I read the book years ago)

                              <span>When I&#x27;m editing some non program files such as documentation for instance, there are times when I need completion for function names or variables of one language or the other.
 For example I many need completion for some functions and variables from some C or Lisp project I am editing, and I need to trigger it momentarily or temporarily for names from the project then turn it off after I get the names I want.
 It would be a good to have a some file-local variables that hold a list of project directories and file types that would provide the completion canditates then toggle them on and of when needed.
 One of my configurations had a completion that showed a list of groups that the completion at point could be based on, but it hasn&#x27;t been coming up of late.

                              <span>Hi,
 this is getting frustrating for a noob like me...
 I have this:
 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode rainbow-mode)) 
 This does NOT work. The package is installed correctly and works but is not turned on automatically in org.
 The I have this:
 (use-package org-appear :ensure t :hook (org-mode org-appear-mode)) 
 This also does not work, same problem as above.
 Do you see the patttern?
 But I also have this:
 (use-package svg-tag-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode svg-tag-mode)) 
 And this DOES work.
 So what is the f... difference?
 Many thanks
 ​

                              <span>According to the info, &quot;The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is disabled.&quot; 
 I would like my hook to behave in one way when the mode is enabled, and differently when it&#x27;s disabled. What is the best approach for that? Is there any way to make the hook aware of its context?
 ​
 Some more info about my use-case: this is for my work-in-progress package sticky-shell, whose main purpose is to define a minor mode in a shell buffer, displaying a header with the latest prompt. This makes it easier to keep track of which command was run, even in cases where the command has many lines of output. I&#x27;ve noticed that, some times, the command can be quite long and not fit within a single header-line. For these cases, I&#x27;ve come up with &#x60;sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode&#x27;, which is an additional mode shortening the header.
 I would like this additional mode to be &quot;tied&quot; to the sticky-shell-mode, so that when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode is also automatically disabled. 
 I&#x27;d also like users to be able to turn on/off shorten-header-mode whenever they want, and choose whether to run a sticky-shell-mode hook to automatically enable the shorten-header-mode every time they enable sticky-shell-mode.
 In my mind, all of these features would be accomplished by keeping the two as separate modes, and constructing a hook for sticky-shell-mode that will be context-aware, so that when sticky-shell-mode is enabled the hook automatically enables shorten-header (if the user opts in to this feature), and when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, the hook automatically disables shorten-header.
 ​
 Does anybody have suggestions for this? Should I try a different approach instead?

                              <span>Hi!
 For the past I_do_not_know_how_many years, I have constantly been switching between Vim/NeoVim and Emacs. Recently, NeoVim was my editor of choice due to the blazing fast development pace. In a very short time, we gained a very powerful scripting language, tree-sitter support, LSP, etc.
 From the user&#x27;s point of view, Emacs seemed stalled. Since I did not participate in the development, Emacs was just a colossal inertia going on in a uniform movement for me.
 However, things did change A LOT in the last few years. Emacs 29 is just amazing! We have tree-sitter support, LSP support, native compilation, etc. The community packages are fantastic (as always) and very well-integrated. The experience could not be better.
 I would like to thank all the devs for their amazing work.
 I also need to mention Doom emacs, which helped me with a fantastic set of sane default configurations.

                              <span>How would you write or edit this function so that it only returns buffers which are of files.
 It would ignore buffers like dired direcetory buffers or help menu buffers etc. It would only return buffers like main.el or module.py or my-textfile.txt.
 I am still new to elisp and I appreciate it. If you show me I will study it to understand better going forward. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have been using Emacs for a while now, and had set it up very well to suit my old Ubuntu system (used Emacs 27.1). Now having switched to Mac, I am facing several issues. I am unsure whether it is due to the usage of the 28.2 Emacs version or the Mac that is causing these issues. I have listed them all below. Please provide any help you can for any of the issues.
  
When I do C-x 5 f , the new frame which is opened has the default settings of font and not what is on my ~/.emacs . However the theme (cobalt-blue) is as defined on my init file. The piece of code I use for font is (set-frame-font &quot;Monospace Bold&quot;) . Is this sufficient to keep the font same across all buffers and frames I open on my Emacs? If not, how do I fix this issue? If you think there is something else that is overriding this command and leading to my problem, please let me know. I will provide more details from my init file.
 To open Emacs from terminal I followed the steps provided here. However, I am unable to open a specific Emacs file from my terminal. Whenever I try to do emacs file.py it opens the only the emacs GUI front page without loading the contents of file.py. It says on the terminal -bash: .emacs: Permission denied. How do I fix this issue and open the file.py on Emacs?
 The keyboard for Mac is different from the one I used for my Ubuntu system. The Command key plays the role of the Control key here, but has many more features. I added the line (setq mac-command-modifier &#x27;control) to map my Command key to Emacs control key. However, this messes up everything because the fundamental operations using Command key (such as closing files using Command-q ) is not working. So is there a good key mapping (For Control and Meta keys) for Emacs for MacOS that someone can suggest?

 How can I extract a new list that has all elements that start with &quot;a&quot;?
 I tried to ask chatGPT to solve this one, but to no avail.
 Sure most people here are smarter than me and chatGPT...

                              <span>I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t already part of the standard python package (at least not for 27.2). In python mode, Is there a way to get a &quot;f&quot; prefixed to a string if you type a &quot;{&quot; while typing inside a string?
 I tried writing my own solution but it relies on regexp and is fragile. I think I saw a solution a year ago but it relied on the tree-sitter package which I had trouble installing.

 For those not familiar with the auto close tag / auto rename tag extension, it works like this:

 I type

 I get  immediately, as soon as I type the trailing &gt;.

 And if i edit the first  to be let&#x27;s say , then immediately the second  becomes a .

 But i can&#x27;t find any documentation about it ? I was thinking maybe it will be published once its officially released, but it seems this is the case now : https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-6-1-alpha1-is-now-available/5585.
 Is it too soon ? Or maybe it exists and i missed it ?

                              <span>I am writing a text for school and I have to cite in &quot;The Chicago Citation Style&quot; Author-date. I would like to write the text in org-mode and export it into a latex/pdf file. I already tried to manipulate the latex file that org produced to make it cite with this style, but I wasn&#x27;t able to make it work. So is there a way to this directly in org mode.

                              <span>As org-mode users we have many built-in functions for text , but often we deal not only with text but within files, with operations by the files themselves. Which also need to be organized. For these goals org-attach are quite suitable.
 What to do with attached files to org-heading when subtree moves to another file, to archive or backup folder? It is necessary to move or copy files with their folder to the archive.
 In search of solution for moving attached files found function . Unfortunately, it does not work fully. If you refuse operations directly from the agenda some code can be removed, (org-with-point-at-org-buffer etc. But the new-dir value does not appear at the stage (when-let.. . Have not found other solutions.
 What features do you use to move file attachments to other folders/locations when archiving?

                              <span>Using Org-mode, I completed HoMM3&#x27;s second scenario, Guardian Angels, 150% faster than existing playthroughs. My results are peer-reviewed on r/Heroes3; ratio is 90%. (Scenario 1 Org-mode analysis here.)
 The entire scenario boiled down to to planning the first turn correctly. I shudder to imagine doing so without Org-mode to reduce complexity.
  
First I iterated the list of operations by studying the map.
 Then I grasped the strategic plan of 4 main heroes each clearing a surface quadrant.
 Then I iterated the tactical logistics of turn 1 to transform a haphazard landing zone into a well-supported blitz.
  
The outline simplified the process of deduction in #1-2, allowing me to focus on execution with a clearly-defined goal in #3.
 This YouTube Org-mode demo video shows how I used a single outline to
  
study the map
 iterate operations and tactics
 publish my results
 follow up.

 There is one more scenario in the campaign. Then I will write the campaign strategy document. Let me know how I can improve the series.

                              <span>I run a GTD setup with a separate inbox.org file and want my agenda to show me all entries from this particular file ever though they are not tagged and have no &quot;TODO&quot; status. 
 Longer explanation: In my setup, I assign the TODO status while doing weekly review to tasks I intend to do this week. Thus, I do not want to add a TODO status to inbox items, since I would have to remove it in most occasions before I refile the task. Problem is: I also would like for inbox items to be shown in agenda, since I have to act (refile) on them. But agenda is for tasks only, as far as I understand. 
 Of course, I could assign some tag like ::INBOX:: to inbox items, but it makes no difference, since I would have to remove it later too, or write a custom refile function which removes it. 
 Is it possible to force agenda to display all not-scheduled, not-task items from a particular org-documents only?

                              <span>I recently started working with the org-journal and maintaining the daily note. I went through the org-journal documentation and decided to add the :carried: tags for carryover items (especially todo items TODO, STRT, ...) instead of deleting them from the previous day and rescheduling the carried one to today&#x27;s date (which also I am working on to configure) so that in the calendar view I can see how many days I have spent working on that particular goal. Now every time I try to create a new entry in the journal, all carryover tasks are getting added.
 I also tried configuring  (setq org-journal-carryover-items &quot;-carried&quot;)  but after adding this one, org-journal started to tag my non-todo items with that and include the non-todo items as carryover tasks which I don&#x27;t want. This solved the issue of adding carryover tasks though.
 I just want only todo tasks to be carried over the next day once when I create new journal entry.
 If possible I want to mark the task as DONE for older entries also one I mark the carried over tasks as DONE in my current journal entry (:P)

                              <span>I find myself wanting types like Tuple3 Tuple4 etc. Checking Pursuit I found the Data.Tuple.Nested library. Its interesting that this library just nests Tuple. I find this kind of inconvenient for pattern matching as I need to write out all these nested Tuples.
 Does anyone have any idea why the authors just didn&#x27;t implement something like:
 data Tuple4 a b c d &#x3D; Tuple4 a b c d 
 This obviously removes the nesting. But it seems like since Data.Tuple.Nested is its own library there must have been a reason...
 Is this nesting better for some reason?

                              <span>I love org-mode and used it to write the last two publications. The problem is, that Markdown is more widespread and, since it has so many editors, easier to get people to subscribe to. In particular, now that there&#x27;s https://quarto.org
 There are still many things that are better in org-mode, but unless we can give people a way to use it without telling them that they need to use emacs as well, we&#x27;ll be fighting an uphill battle.
 I was thinking of something recently and wanted to pick the communities brains a bit:
 Is there something like a &quot;command-line emacs translator&quot; that can take an org-mode file, execute it and retrurn the HTML or PDF, or ...
 A bit like Quarto, but for org-mode. Does such a thing exist?
 Or is there an emacs version, that&#x27;s fully set-up, so the user doesn&#x27;t need to know anything about it to use it?
 I don&#x27;t mean Doom Emacs. That&#x27;s what my config is built on, but that&#x27;s still too complex for most people.

 Having some kind of subwindow open with a list of potential links which can be selected by the user, and perhaps the ability to sort/separate different kind of links, as in &quot;internal document&quot;/&quot;external document&quot;/&quot;url&quot; or remote vs local links. 
 Is there anything that does this simply, or am I really looking at some serious development work for this?

                              <span>I am looking for ways to split my configuration into multiple files that would work with byte and native compilation. For the past year, I have been using init-loader to load my el files. However, native compilation has always produced many errors like &quot;Assignment/reference to free variable&quot; or &quot;function not know to be defined&quot;. I assume that&#x27;s because each file is compiled separately and some files might depend on packages that are loaded in other files (in other words, I load them in order, but they are compiled separately).
 These warnings haven&#x27;t bothered for the most part, but every once in a while I run into issues because a &quot;function&quot; is actually a macro and it needs to be expanded correctly for native compilation to produce the right results.
 What is the correct way to split configuration into multiple files while making sure that byte and native compilation works?

                              <span>Hi,
 newbie here.
 There are cases (eg. in svg-tag-tags) where you cannot specify (say) a background color, but instead you specify a face to use.
 Now my question is: What face do you use in such cases?
 What I currently do is use a face that is already defined but not used in my document (usually I use org-level-8) that I tweak with custom-set-faces.
 However I feel that this a bit of a hack and it would make more sense to define my own face (that however I don&#x27;t yet know how to do).
 So should this be the way to do it: How would I define a new face that is based on an already existing face and only adjusts some attributes?
 I hope that was understandable....
 Many thanks!

But in so doing, the recent files are listed with their full paths (only with the slight shortening of abbreviate-file-name), and this gives me very long candidates, sometimes longer than the window width, frequently pushing marginalia&#x27;s annotations off-screen, and giving me more hits on this source then I&#x27;d wish for. So I&#x27;d like to shorten these candidates to just their file names, and not their path (or at least as much as it unambiguous, but for the time being I&#x27;m trying it with file-name-nondirectory, even if that means that some duplicates occur which will not be shown in the completion).

 Will lookahead &amp; lookbehind assertions ever be officially added to Emacs regex?
 Or is there any technical reason preventing it?

 why is this not working:
 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :config (rainbow-mode)) 
 I would expect it to ensure that rainbow-mode is installed and turn it on, but it does not turn it on.
 Why? What is the proper way to do that?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to learn myself a little elisp using code-blocks in org mode:
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp (setq colors &#x27;(&quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot;)) (print colors) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: | blue | red | #+BEGIN_SRC elisp (dolist (item &#x27;(1 2 3)) (print item)) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: 
 ​
 Now what I don&#x27;t understand here is that the first code block produces the expected output in the result-area, the second code block where I iterate over a list however produces no output.
 &quot;Code block produced no output&quot; is what emacs says - but why? Why don&#x27;t I see 1 2 3?
 Please enlighten me here...

                              <span>This is the first release that was executed via the new GitHub CI. Everything went smoothly, except for an unexpected packaging bug on windows due to text-2.0 linking against libstdc++ by default.
 If you&#x27;re affected by this and have a defunct binary, simply run the installer again.
 We&#x27;re also delighted to announce integration with errors.haskell.org, which already has a couple of GHCup codes documented, e.g. https://errors.haskell.org/messages/GHCup-00010/
 How to update/install
 Follow the instructions here: GHCup 
 Or run ghcup upgrade for existing installations.
 ChangeLog
  
restore proper support for FreeBSD and Linux armv7
 integrate with errors.haskell.org, wrt #434
 allow to overwrite distro detection via config wrt #421 
 this is particularly useful for e.g. Ubuntu derivates, where ghcup doesn&#x27;t pick the optimal bindist, also see the GHCup documentation on overriding distro detection
 
 Add proper support for mirrors wrt #357
 fix a (harmless) bug in ghcup nuke on windows
 improvements to ghcup add-release-channel wrt #708
 fix building newer GHC from source wrt #433
 Fix ghcup install hls -u on windows
 Fix failure with --isolate&#x3D;dir --force
 Add --metadata-fetching-mode arg, fixes #440
 Add content-length property to downloads
 Fix a grave bug on armv7 during installation wrt #415
 improve many warning/error messages (contributions by @taylorfausak)
 some minor optimization in ghcup whereis ghcup
 improve --keep&#x3D;always to not clean up directories in certain circumstances
  
Not there yet
  
TUI on windows has a prototype, but it has performance issues that makes it of questionable usability... needs more investigation
 compiling HLS from within the TUI? This needs more discussion

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell for the past couple of months, and in order to solve a problem I am working on, I need to be able to calculate the diameter of a n-ary tree. However I feel like I&#x27;ve been banging my head against the wall these past few days as I cannot seem to get it to work.
 The tree is represented as a list of pairs that represent the edges of the tree: for example
 [(1,2),(1,3)] will be the following tree:
 1 
 / \
 2 3
 Is there a simple way to calculate the diameter of a tree in O(n)?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Recently I&#x27;ve been trying to understand how Erlang&#x27;s bit syntax works, and in the process wrote a library which does something similar:
 https://github.com/stevana/bits-and-bobs#readme
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post, providing motivation, showing how to use the library and explaining how it&#x27;s implemented. I&#x27;m especially interested in how we can go beyond what Erlang does when it comes working with binary data, I mention some ideas in the last part of &quot;contributing&quot; section.
 I hope you find it interesting, and please let me know if you got any feedback, questions or comments!

                              <span>Hey all, I have been adventuring into the topic of the various programming paradigms and am at a wall in my understanding. I am only moderate at Haskell and know the basics about the more advanced tooling, so I would like someone here to discuss some things with me.
 I will introduce my problem with a code requirement. Suppose a developer of a library has the following function (in C#):
 cs public IEnumerable SortUsingName(IEnumerable items, string algorithm) 
 This is a common problem posed to juniors where they will refactor some code to use the factory and strategy pattern, which would end up looking something like this:
 cs public IEnumerable SortUsingName(IEnumerable items, string algorithm) { var sorter &#x3D; SorterFactory.Create(algorithm); return sorter.Sort(items); }…</span>

                              <span>I was reading through https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/04/async-exception-handling-haskell/ where the author claims it is never safe to recover from asynchronous exceptions. The safe-exceptions package also claims it.
 Now, I&#x27;m not sure what recovering means here, but if it really means catching an exception, doing something and not re-throwing it all the way until the program exits, it sounds extreme. One practical example is as follows: a chat application attempts to send a message to another user, but delivery times out asynchronously, i.e. a caller-imposed timeout. Or perhaps the user cancels the action by pressing a button. Whatever was trying to send the message should do its own cleanup and rethrow, via bracket. However, at some point the application is going to have to present an error gracefully to the user and ignore the exception, not just clean up and crash. Or maybe it wants to reattempt delivery at a later point.
 So, what does it really mean that recovering from async exceptions isn&#x27;t safe? In the previous example, it&#x27;s true that one might not trivially know whether the action completed, failed or did something inbetween, but recovery is still theoretically possible, e.g.: explicit state syncing or reporting back what step failed (did we receive an acknowledgement from the server or did we cancel before?). Perhaps it means that recovery cannot always happen locally and you might often need to propagate exceptions upwards. But taken to the extreme, it seems to imply that async exceptions must always result in a crash, albeit a safe one.

Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be mouse-based, keyboard-based commands would be fine. The recording is from InfoQube, which is unique in letting you make dragged items siblings or subitems of the target, based on the end location of the drag and drop operation.
 ​
 I really, really like many things I can do in orgmode, e. g. assigning many different todo states, filtering items for printing with the noexport tag, using refile for quick archiving etc.
 But for me, there is one seriously glaring weakness in its arsenal: It makes it sooo difficult to move multiple items around in an outline, it&#x27;s not even funny.

                              <span>Is there a way to have emacs evaluate on saving an org-mode .org file if it&#x27;s in the org-agenda-files list and, if not, automatically add it to the list currently in emacs?
 Of course, to keep refreshes on org-agenda and the todos and such up to date. 
 While I found this response to the fact that new files are not added to org-agenda-files I was a bit surprised a save hook of some sort could not be used to do this automagically and without having to resort to inotify or manual triggering of a function or evaluation.

                              <span>Hi All 
 I&#x27;m re-working some MS Azure Labs in powershell and bash to improve my understanding.
 Doing this in org-mode, be gentle, I&#x27;ve been using org for a while but babel not so much. I&#x27;m thinking of blogging my solutions.
 When I run some of the commands they echo things that I don&#x27;t want the world to see. I want the text of the output but with some of the fields obfuscated.
 This needs to be as automated as possible and repeatable.
 example:
 When I log in to Azure I see something like the following. I&#x27;d like to edit the email address and the last part of the Tenant ID as I have done here 
  Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- email@outlook.com Azure subscription 1 29aa18ee-fdf4-49f7-b5f2-xxxxxxxxxxxx AzureCloud 
 I have a notion of running an emacs lisp code block over the output but have not come up with a way to achieve that. 
 Thanks
 Steven.

                              <span>While I use math-preview for most mathematical formulas, quite often I am taking notes on coding topics where I am quite often writing lines like start_date. Currently in org-mode when I type this inline it is subscripting to $start_{date}$ which is, well... not great. 
 Is there a way to disable this behaviour (or better yet, enable it when I want it? ... like with markdown where inline math gets rendered as above denoted by single $ bracketed formulae? This is weirdly something markdown seems to get right over org-mode near as I can tell (as well as the ease of having inline code blocks. denoted by backticks in a line.
 Hunting in the docs I could not see a way to granularly control this without turning off prettier_entities completely which would impact a lot of niceties.

 ​
 The main impetus for this was having lots of icloud files, trying to open them from within Emacs, and Emacs opening the local &quot;.icloud&quot; file, causing me to have to open Finder and download the file from there.
 So I wrote up a quick package to help with these cases: automatically download an iCloud file when trying to open it, plus some additional utilities, like downloading a list of files or any file matching a regexp within a given directory. As far as I know these aren&#x27;t easily achievable from Finder or the command line, so it&#x27;s nice to have an Emacs interface for them.
 Sharing here in case people are interested: it needs some more work (see some of the TODOs in the code for example), but I could turn this into a proper package. Any feedback on the code is welcome.
 I&#x27;m also wondering if people can think of different ways to achieve this: Emacs has been around for a long time so I&#x27;m sure it has some functionalities to deal with remote files already. Maybe it&#x27;d be possible to use those built-ins for this purpose as well?

                              <span>I use org-mode for daily notes and journaling at work, with mostly the out-of-the box configuration Doom-emacs provides. However, solving simple issues like enabling pdf-mode or even making use some of the org-mode features feels like a struggle.
 I have hard time actually understanding the internal documentation of emacs - a similar feeling I had with linux when I started. That made me realise how the most valuable resources for learning linux were community created guides and users explaining how they do things: and especially how they refer to documentation.
 Where can I find similar resources for emacs? I mainly am interested in personalising orgmode, like creating templates and macro commands. But also more fundamental things such as where to store work-files, and how to separate personal use of orgmode.

 I hope you are doing well. 
 I am new to both emacs and this sub. 
 I am trying to get company mode to complete variables and functions names, but it is not working. I got company mode installed and the backend set to complete-at-point-function. I am also using lsp\lsp-java and it is working.
 I see in mode-line that company is enabled. I would really appreciate any recommendation to fix this issue.
 Thank you for any help you provide.

                              <span>Good morning,
 I have been struggling with company for awhile and have read the docs on company and still haven&#x27;t come up with the solution to the problem I&#x27;ve got. I&#x27;ve searched for solutions to this, but not unexpectedly, searching for emacs company doesn&#x27;t really get to frequency discussions of the company.el module because company is such a common business word. Anyway, I am open to other suggested completion methods or frameworks, I&#x27;m not married to it. First I&#x27;ll describe the problem:
 I&#x27;ll be writing code and it&#x27;ll try to suggest completion. I don&#x27;t have a good screenshot of this, but sometimes I want to complete something like: my_long_signal_name. I start typing and the suggestions and the completion company provides is my_loNG_SIGNAL_NAME. It doesn&#x27;t appear to correctly maintain the case of the original it&#x27;s retrieving the suggestion from. 
 I thought this was something to do with the dabbrev module, but honestly I thought I told it how to handle cases in the configuration and this clearly isn&#x27;t helping.
 (message &quot;---- Company&quot;) (use-package company :config (setq company-dabbrev-ignore-case &#x27;keep-prefix) (setq company-dabbrev-downcase nil)) (use-package company-statistics :hook (after-init-hook . global-company-mode) (after-init-hook . company-statistics-mode)) 
 For awhile I just got rid of it. Emacs vhdl-mode has tab-completion that works pretty well, just doesn&#x27;t provide the dropdown which is nice if there&#x27;s some confusion as to selection.
 Anyone have a SANE company setup that preserves the case of the suggestion? I have thought maybe I ought to use the etags backend perhaps, and like I said, I&#x27;ve gotten rid of it for awhile, though I do like it&#x27;s path name suggestions in other non-source code documents so I&#x27;d kind of like it back.
 Also open to other completion modules, company just is generally frequently recommended.
 Any ideas on how to properly setup company or another module for this behavior? Thanks!

 Can I have all of that in my org literate config (I assume enabling some mode or something)? If not I guess I&#x27;ll go back to an elisp file for the time being.

For yanking from eww, there&#x27;s the command org-eww-copy-for-org-mode (part of the module ol-eww), although it only preserves hyperlinks, no italics or anything else.
 
For Firefox there is the addon Org Capture -- but for me it just copies plaintext! I already wrote a quick setup guide, if you want to give it a spin, but it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me:
 
  
Org Capture web extension
 Step 1. Add these init lines
 (require &#x27;org-protocol) (server-start) 
 Step 2. Make sure you have a member of org-capture-templates that goes something like
 (&quot;p&quot; &quot;Firefox capture&quot; plain (file &quot;/tmp/captures.org&quot;) &quot;* %a\n%i%?&quot;) 
 Step 3. Run the appropriate one-time command found at https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension#register-emacsclient-as-the-org-protocol-handler -- it may look involved but most of it doesn&#x27;t apply to you, just find the bit that does, and copy paste it into M-x shell.
 Done, now you can capture anything by clicking the toolbar button.

 1) Create a rectangular mark using C-M-Mouse1 or C-X-Space 2) M-x string-rectangle or C-x r t 3) Type some letters in the prompt, observe the effects of the string-rectangle preview, but don&#x27;t press RET -- click somewhere else in the buffer instead 4) Press ESC ESC ESC (this kills the string-rectangle prompt) 5) The string-rectangle preview overlay is now &quot;stuck&quot; and can&#x27;t be removed
 I&#x27;m kind of new to Emacs, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a bug. Is this a configuration issue?

                              <span>I have a directory ~/prescient-test/ with two files in it: one.txt and the-one.txt.
 I have installed Prescient and Vertico, and have set them up as follows:
  
emacs -Q
 load vertico
 (vertico-mode 1)
 load prescient
 load vertico-prescient
 (vertico-prescient-mode 1)
  
I then run C-x C-f, navigate to ~/prescient-test/, and type one.
 I would expect both files one.txt and the-one.txt to show up, but only one.txt does.
 Why does it do that? Am I misunderstanding something about prescient? I can&#x27;t seem to reproduce this with completing-read, which is odd. Perhaps it&#x27;s a problem with vertico?

                              <span>Hello people.
 I have a small annoyance when opening Emacs. I currently have a home brewed config that&#x27;s simple enough for my usage that I don&#x27;t need to rely on the daemon to speed up opening a frame. It should take less than a second but recently for some reason when I open Emacs on KDE the task bar shows the icon for Emacs that then closes to give place to what I think it&#x27;s the Emacs Client simply because the title bar shows &quot;Emacs (Client) *scratch\*&quot; but every process monitor shows it&#x27;s a regular Emacs instance.
 This didn&#x27;t happen before. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs frequently and after about a month of continuous usage I began experiencing this behaviour. No matter how I start Emacs, from command line, from the apps menu, from a key combo shortcut. Always the same.
 I tried hiding the emacsclient.desktop file from my user&#x27;s menu with no luck. This happens in KDE regardless of distro. I have an Arch, Manjaro, Garuda and openSUSE TW, all with KDE and all behaving the same. Even when I completely remove my customization files, the regular, old, white Emacs shows the same behaviour. None of these machines have used the daemon/emacsclient in their current installations so I know there&#x27;s no lingering config from the past.
 Any idea where I can look and/or explain this behaviour.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious. Indeed, others here are too, and lurkers might decloak if the interest builds.
I&#x27;ll share some behind the scenes with you. The notes on forgetting started as one note then I saw that they were about different aspects of forgetting. I had critiqued @ctietze&#x27;s note and suggested explosion, so I eat my own dog food, as we say colloquially.
This morning a note in my review cycle stimulated the creation of a hub to bring the ideas about &#x27;Prompts&#x27;  together in a bumper car fashion. Ideas around creating prompts and their use have cropped up in recent readings, and the note that kicked me in the butt was dated December 19, 2020. It seemed like I couldn&#x27;t not make a hub. The &#x27;Prompts&#x27; hub currently organizes 17 notes on the topic.
What I&#x27;m Working On
12 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
Titles and one-sentence summary/meaning of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I&#x27;m currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If this interests you, please start a thread here, DM me.</span>

                              <span>Looking for suggestions for a good distributed job queue library: - Makes it easy to schedule a one-off job to execute at a specific time, and one worker will pick it up/execute it - Also supports cron style jobs (regularly scheduled jobs vs. one-offs) - Underlying queue persistence could be Redis or Postgres - Ideally it’s a Scala lib, but Java is OK too - Ideally reasonably popular/mature - FOSS
 Something like https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq , but for the JVM.

                              <span>So a pretty fun video popped up on my feed 1 Problem, 24 Languages by code_report. In this video, the author solves a single LeetCode problem in 24 different programming languages (including Scala) and gives his thoughts on his likes/dislikes.
 I thought to share this with this forum because, on the slide where he compares runtime performance, Scala is the worst. Now, I had no expectations given the need for a JVM to start that Scala was going to be anywhere near the most performant languages, but I am kinda shocked it&#x27;s literally in last place.
 The author does give caveats that these performance numbers come from the LeetCode editor and even suggests the entire section could be ignored. But I still thought this would be an interesting topic to discuss.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just wondering how much effort is being made toward pushing Haskell as a webdev language.
 ​
 As it turns out, FP is apparently very popular with JSers, given that JS is a semi-functional language due to its inheritance from Scheme. There have actually been JSers who&#x27;ve said:
 ​
 https://www.zerotohero.dev/learn-haskell/
 ​
 Around some community Discord servers, I meet quite a few JS devs, and I think a few prominent Haskellers actually came in from JS.
 ​
 The problem is, well, the typical Haskell problem. People come in, learn some degree of Haskell, use pure Functional Programming to improve their baseline programming skills, then go back to whatever language they use, often taking concepts back to them in order to improve the language.
 ​
 In the JS case, though, is there any way …</span>

                              <span>I can’t figure out how to do this:
 flatten :: (??? t1, ??? t2) &#x3D;&gt; t1 (t2 a) -&gt; t1 a flatMap :: (??? t1, ??? t2) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; t2 b) -&gt; t1 a -&gt; t1 b 
 where flatten is a generalized version of concat and catMaybes, and flatMap is a generalized version of concatMap and mapMaybe.
 And more generally, input lists can usually be replaced by Foldable, but how do you get rid of output lists? I know Traversable lets you repackage stuff back, but it’s the wrong way around for this case.
 Solved:
 flatten :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) &#x3D;&gt; m (t a) -&gt; m a flatten &#x3D; (&gt;&gt;&#x3D; foldr append empty) where append &#x3D; () . pure (.:) :: (c -&gt; d) -&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; d unary .: binary &#x3D; (.) unary . binary infixr 8 .: flatMap :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; t b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b flatMap &#x3D; flatten .: fmap 
 Upd: Alternative versions if you just want an iterator instead of repackaging:
 flatMap :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; t2 b) -&gt; t1 a -&gt; [b] flatMap f &#x3D; concatMap $ toList . f flatten :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) &#x3D;&gt; t1 (t2 b) -&gt; [b] flatten &#x3D; flatMap id

                              <span>I don&#x27;t use haskell at that much these days, but the problem in code_report&#x27;s &quot;1 Problem, 24 Programming Languages&quot; video piqued my interest. The problem description is:
 Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and of negative integers (0 is considered neither negative or positive). 
 The video presents a haskell solution iterates over the list twice:
 maximumCount xs &#x3D; on max length pos neg where pos &#x3D; filter (&gt;0) xs neg &#x3D; filter (&lt;0) xs 
 and a commenter presents an optimisation using span and dropWhile. 
 Out of the presented solutions, only C++ used std::equal_range, which performs binary search to find the solution. In wondering if there was an elegant haskell alternative I found the linked article.
 Are there any other idiomatic ways to efficiently approach this problem in Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on writing a Haskell newcomer guide here: https://haskell-docs.netlify.app/
 The goal is to be the sort of thing that the user in this question is looking for, i.e. something that satisfies this table:
  
  Wiki LYAH Real world Haskell This project Various Books 
  
 Free y y y y n 
  Community editable y n n y n 
  Beginner friendy n y y y y 
  Up-to-date n n n y y 
  Looks nice n y n y y 
  Supports comments n n n y n 
  Good pedagogy ? y y not yet y 
 
 Of these, I think looking really nice, and being easy to edit (but not too easy) via a Github PR are the most important. See more thoughts in this vein here
 This is of course a work in progress, and is at an early stage. But writing something like this is a longterm, multi-person effort, so I wanted to share what I&#x27;ve …</span>

 But I&#x27;m looking specifically for something that is written in &quot;idiomatic haskell&quot; (if such a thing exists) but not too abstract I mean not too much monad transformers for example ;)
 Something like this maybe ? https://github.com/DataKinds/cherchord

As the 2022 State of Haskell Survey highlighted, one of the most desired improvements to the whole ecosystem is better documentation and learning material.
That issue can only be addressed with great effort. For this reason, many contributions are necessary to tackle the problem from several angles.

                              <span>I am looking for a way to improve my workflow while working on a specific function in my code. I&#x27;ve used that function once, but I can&#x27;t remember the exact name. That is an Emacs feature or package that allows me to hide all the code outside of the function I am currently working on while keeping that function visible. This is not the traditional code folding method, which allows toggling visibility of multiple functions or classes at once.

                              <span>How should I add the packages to enable parsing Unicode text, specifically cyrillic and Japanese, when exporting to a PDF in org-mode? Do I have just to specify the Latex packages in the config file?
 I was trying to add \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} and \\usepackage[russian]{babel} while using xelatex, but those didn&#x27;t work: I still didn&#x27;t have any text in the exported files. I have Latex installed correctly. What is the proper way to enable those packages?

                              <span>I am not a good Elisp hacker. When I started using ChatGPT more often, I started experimenting with letting it write Elisp code. 
 I am completely blown away what it can do!
 Example Query
  
Write an Emacs Lisp function that will do two successive regular expression search and replace functions. First it should search for this regular expression ^- and replace by ##, next it should search for this regular expression: ^[ \t]+- and replace by -
  
Result
  
Here&#x27;s an example function that performs the two search and replace operations you described:
  
 (defun my-search-replace () (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;^- &quot; nil t) (replace-match &quot;## &quot;)) (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;^[ \t]+-&quot; nil t) (replace-match &quot;- &quot;)))) 
  
This function can be called with M-x my-search-replace, you can also assign it to a keybinding, like this (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c s&quot;) &#x27;my-search-replace)
  
It even EXPLAINS the answer! Wow!
 I&#x27;ll start hacking more Elisp now that I have a patient teacher.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a server that requires a password and one-time code to log in over ssh (no key-based login possible), and this does basically work with tramp after adding the OTP-prompt to &#x60;password-word-equivalents&#x60;.
 However, tramp is having trouble filling in the password automatically even though it does find a corresponding entry in &#x60;auth-sources&#x60; (I&#x27;m using the &#x60;pass&#x60; backend which works fine). I think the issue is that the server _first_ asks for the one-time code, and _then_ for the password.
 Thanks to the power of the recursive minibuffer, I&#x27;m able to call &#x60;password-store-otp-token-copy&#x60; and &#x60;password-store-copy&#x60; when tramp asks for one-time code and password, search for the right entry, then paste the code/password back to the prompt.
 Ideally, I would like to &quot;teach&quot; tramp to find the password on its own so I don&#x27;t need to manually find and paste it every time. Is there a way of telling it which secret to use for which prompt? Alternatively, would it be possible somehow wrap the login process in an elisp function that automates the task?
 I&#x27;m asking here since I&#x27;m a little bit stuck on where / what to look for in the tramp / auth-source source code; I&#x27;ve read the manual pretty extensively but can&#x27;t find much on the topic. Luckily it&#x27;s not a huge issue since the ssh connection is re-used for subsequent logins so I only have to do this once or twice a day, but automating the login process would still be a nice improvement.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                              <span>I am trying to get a Jupyter-like experience in org mode using org mode. I mostly followed the &quot;Replacing Jupyter Notebook with Org Mode&quot; blog post by sqrtminusone and added some additional config to have conda-environment-aware IDE features in Python mode. You can see my current config here: https://github.com/martibosch/snakemacs 
 The issue is that, although python-mode is activated within jupyter-python src blocks, I do not get proper indentation when I use the tab key. This is expected since org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to nil in my config (following the config by sqrtminusone. However, if I set it to t, everytime I use the RET and TAB keys (bound to org-return and org-cycle respectively) within jupyter-python src blocks, I get the switch-to-buffer behavior (e.g., conda environment activation from conda.el), which makes the editing slow and completely unpractical (tons of &quot;Switched to conda environment&quot; messages). 
 How can I get TAB indentation in my jupyter-python blocks without having this switch-to-buffer behavior? Thank you.

For comparison this is what the suggestions on my emacs config looks like compared to doom emacs and lunarvim. The first is my config, the second is lunarvim, the third is doom emacs. I have enabled company-mode as well as lsp-mode with the clangd server installed on my own configuration.

 Kele (可乐, kě lè, or kə-ˈlə) (“Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs”) is a Kubernetes cluster management package. It empowers you to perform operations as coarse or fine-grained as you need, fast, and get back to your work. 
 For a peek at what&#x27;s currently possible, visit the documentation site, in particular the Usage section. For this initial release, it has feature parity with kubectx and kubens and that&#x27;s about it, but there&#x27;s lots of room for growth.
 It also comes with “batteries included,” containing several integrations with noteworthy packages, in particular Embark, that you can take advantage of for nimbly interacting with your configs and clusters.
 It&#x27;s now on MELPA, so feel free to give it a try and leave your thoughts in the discussion board!
 EDIT: Quick demo GIF for you all

                              <span>Hello,
 I used to be a Scala dev, and I came back to my home country, Korea because of COVID situation.
 Now I&#x27;m thinking of working in abroad again, because I&#x27;m about 40, and it&#x27;s &#x27;RELATIVELY&#x27; old to find a DEV job in Korea. Surprisingly, age is a huge deal breaker when finding jobs, especially DEV jobs in Korea. And it&#x27;s hard to find Scala jobs in my home country because only few people are using it, and I prefer to work in English environment.
 I would say my skill is in somewhere between beginner and mid level (hoping it&#x27;s learning toward to mid). I have limited experience in Cats or IO like that, but I am happy to use it and learn it more. And I can do some front-end dev also.
 Is there any good countries to find Scala jobs more easily? In my view defining &#x27;GOOD&#x27; is,
  
places where plenty of find jobs exists
 gives working visa easily
 decent salaries
  
I think 1 and 2 is most important, 3 is somewhat negotiable.
 I know economy is not good recently, but what else I can do, I need money.
 Thanks in advance.

 I&#x27;m using Cabal to partition my project into a library, tests, etc. like this:

 library exposed-modules: MyModule -- ... other fields
 test-suite MyTests build-depends: MyProject other-modules: MyModuleTests -- ... other fields &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 There is a function MyModule.optimise :: OptimiseIn -&gt; OptimiseOut, and MyModuleTests randomly generates tests that call a function MyModule.interface :: InterfaceIn -&gt; InterfaceOut, which depends on optimise. These tests have allowed me to construct a [InterfaceIn] of inputs for which interface appears to be producing incorrect results. It seems likely that the errors are occurring in the calls to optimise, as o…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been interested in Haskell for years, but never learned it just because there seems to be no VERY good resource to learn Haskell.
 By &quot;VERY good&quot;, I mean ALL of the following are satisfied:
  
up to date
 
official or at least de fact standard
 
general syntax is fully described (variables, arrays, strings, class, functions, loops, etc)
 
it takes tens of hours to read through it (In other words, it should be much detailed than a simple &quot;Getting Started&quot; tutorial.)
 
 Currently, I can write more than 10 languages: Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript etc. And for many of them, there is a VERY good resource.
 Rust has the official the Book. TypeScript has the official Handbook. Go has the unofficial Learning Go - O&#x27;REILLY, which was released 1.5 years ago but almost up-to-date except for the generics support.
 How about Haskell? haskell.org lists some documentations but I can&#x27;t tell if they satisfy the conditions above (especially for whether or not they are up-to-date).

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was wondering what is the intuition behind the .compile() method of fs2 streams in scala. One thing I notice from examples that some methods are enabled once .compile() is called, for example one could do .compile().count() to count the number of elements of streams. But what does the compile actually do ? 
 Thanks

                              <span>When I learn about haskell and its advanced features I see a lot of people developing compilers, DSLs etc haskell. And there is some fixation with parsers of every kind. Whereas in other general purpose programming languages like cpp, java, rust, python etc I see applications all around, not specific to a particular domain. Why do we not see more use of haskell in things like frontend, servers , game development, smartphone apps , data science etc . I am a newebie so am kind of intrigued why this is the case.

                              <span>Hi all! I wanted to show off a project that I&#x27;m using to learn Haskell language: a &quot;hello&quot; web browser.
 https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The project is based on Dillo web browser (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillo): it&#x27;s an existing project with C and C++ code base, being slowly re-written by me in Haskell. The biggest part written in Haskell is responsible for parsing and matching of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) but there are also other bits of code re-written in Haskell. This is just a side project that I do in spare time, so don&#x27;t expect too much from it :)
 I decided to use an existing project (Dillo) and re-implement parts of it in Haskell because:
  
 I wanted to have a constant feedback on whether my code works or not (a web page either displays correctly or stops being displayed correctly),
 I wanted to see how much more compact Haskell code can be compared to original C and C++ code (so far code stats show no significant improvements in code size, probably due to my lack of knowledge of Haskell),
 I wanted to eventually end up with some &quot;real world&quot; program that has large parts of it in Haskell, and a web browser seemed &quot;real world&quot; enough.
  
​
 The project is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The Haskell code is in this sub-directory: https://github.com/acerion/hello/tree/master/src/Hello
 If you have any feedback or suggestions then I&#x27;m happy to hear them (just be aware that it will take a lot of time for me to take them in, this project is just a big experiment ran in spare time).

 Artificial is a leading UK-based Insurtech company. We are working on modernising the global commercial and specialty insurance/reinsurance markets. The majority of this industry centres around London (e.g. Lloyd&#x27;s of London) and provides roughly 8% of Greater London&#x27;s overall GDP. Some example lines insured are property, marine shipping/cargo, energy, cyber security, and political violence. We successfully raised a £9.5M Series A mid-last year.
 As part of our digitisation effort, we developed our own (non-embedded) DSL (in Haskell, of course) called Brossa, with which we can describe insurance products. This approach allows us to build insurance specifics into our programming language as first-class concepts to model structured data capture, data augmentation/enrichment, appeti…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to transition from imperative languages to functional ones, specifically Haskell, and started doing the challenges in HackerRank at the same time that I learn. It&#x27;s a little hard when you come from imperative languages 😓.
 Currently, I&#x27;m struggling with the challenge Compare the Triplets. I&#x27;ve already spent some hours to have this:
 input &#x3D; &quot;5 6 7\n3 6 10&quot; [a&#x27;, b&#x27;] &#x3D; map words $ lines input a &#x3D; (map read a&#x27;) :: [Int] b &#x3D; (map read b&#x27;) :: [Int] score :: (Num a, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a, a) score x y | x &gt; y &#x3D; (1, 0) | x  [(a, a)] -&gt; (a, a) sum&#x27; [] &#x3D; (0, 0) sum&#x27; (x:xs) &#x3D; (fst x + fst (sum&#x27; xs), snd x + snd (sum&#x27; xs)) main :: IO () main &#x3D; print $ sum&#x27; scores 
 It works, but I&#x27;m stuck trying to get rid of input and use interactive instead to get the data. So my questions are:
  
May someone help me with the input part?
 I&#x27;m sure it can be done better, but I&#x27;m not able to figure out how, unless using an imperative approach. May someone point me to a more elegant/haskable way to solve it? (I&#x27;m planning to use a fold for the sum, for example).
  
Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>I want to write a function where you enter a list of delimiters tuples, and a string,
 And the function should check if the string is balanced according to the tuples we input. And return a boolean value.
 ​
 For example:
 ​
 INPUT: balanceList [(&#x27;[&#x27;,&#x27;}&#x27;)] &quot;[}&quot;\&#x60;
 OUTPUT: \True&#x60;&#x60;
 ​
 INPUT: \balanceList [(&#x27;{&#x27;,&#x27;)&#x27;] &quot;{}&quot;&#x60;&#x60;
 OUTPUT: &#x60;False&#x60;
 ​
 Here is my current code:
 balanceList :: [(Char, Char)] -&gt; String -&gt; Bool balanceList pairs string &#x3D; balanced string emptyStack where balanced [] stack &#x3D; isEmpty stack balanced (c:string) stack |c &#x60;elem1&#x60; (map fst pairs) &#x3D; balanced string (push c stack) |c &#x60;elem1&#x60; (map snd pairs) &#x3D; popTest (pop stack) where popTest Nothing &#x3D; False popTest (Just (x,s)) &#x3D; x &#x3D;&#x3D; c &amp;&amp; balanced string s balanced (_:string) stack &#x3D; balanced string stack 
 ​
 When I input balanceList [(&#x27;[&#x27;,&#x27;}&#x27;)] &quot;[}&quot; I get False instead of True
 How can I solve this issue?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the first part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial#readme
 I think it&#x27;s a resource that&#x27;s missing, not just for Haskell but the larger (property-based) testing community. Given that I&#x27;ve tried to strike a balance between being general and abstract in the motivation and how it works sections so that people unfamiliar with Haskell can get something out of it, while being concrete in the (Haskell) code sections.
 I hope to announce part two on concurrent testing next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

 I&#x27;m very excited to announce release 3.13 of Copilot. Copilot is a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones. It also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for the requirements elicitation tool FRET (https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/), via Ogma (https://github.com/nasa/ogma). These tools make it trivial to integrate Copilot monitors into other systems, by providing C modules with plain i…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I am new to emacs and just discovered emacsclient.
 What I would now like to have is a shell-alias that would run an emacsclient that automatically starts a server if there isn&#x27;t one but I just cannot figure it out...
 This is what I have tried:
 emacsclient -c -a &quot;emacs --daemon&quot; emacsclient -c -a &quot;&quot; ALTERNATE_EDITOR&#x3D;&quot;&quot; emacsclient -c -a &quot;&quot; 
 In all these cases the client starts and the server gets started but the client does not connect to the server -it only prints &quot;Waiting for emacs&quot; to the console...
 So is there a way to have a command that simply always works - ie. if there is a server it simply connects, if there is no server it starts one and connects?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi! How to enforce proper indentation in built-in python.el mode according to PEP8 for multi-line brackets
 I have sample code: python test &#x3D; { &#x27;abc&#x27;: &#x27;def&#x27;, }  If I write &quot;by hand&quot; closing bracket the indentation (4 spaces) is correct, but when I type C-x h  (or just  in the last line) the closing bracket moves to the beginning of the line: python test &#x3D; { &#x27;abc&#x27;: &#x27;def&#x27;, }  I have variable python-indent-offset explicitly set to 4. Tested on my config with eglot, smartparens and more but also with emacs started with -q flag (no init)

                              <span>I debug C++ programs using dap-mode and lldb-vscode on MacOS. Since a while back, I get Python error messages in the *Out* buffer of the running program. I&#x27;d like to get rid of them. Does anybody know the cause of this and if there is any way of fixing it?
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  NameError: name &#x27;run_one_line&#x27; is not defined Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  NameError: name &#x27;run_one_line&#x27; is not defined Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  NameError: name &#x27;run_one_line&#x27; is not defined . . . 
 ​
 I have Python 3.10.9 installed. The debug template configuration looks like this:
 (dap-register-debug-template &quot;
&quot; (list :type &quot;lldb-vscode&quot; :cwd &quot;
&quot; :request &quot;launch&quot; :program &quot;
&quot; :name &quot;
&quot;)) 
 Everything works in the debug session, it&#x27;s just the error messages at the start that I&#x27;m concerned about.
 lldb-vscode is installed together with llvm using homebrew.

                              <span>This prevents from using emacs in a full fledged manner and have to depend on some terminal emulator or shell. For eg, I use python a lot and I need ipython to view dataframes properly which look bad within emacs. 
 Also eshell doesn&#x27;t work outside emacs, so I cannot carry over my knowledge of eshell when I have to use some other terminal emulator. There should be an elisp interpreter outside of emacs so that I can write some small scripts within it instead of using python.

I love the fast modal editing keys available at sexp boundaries, and how all commands leave you on such a boundary. I love the use of [] to get to the end of a sexp, and M-m to mark a local string/variable/etc. Slurping, barfing, moving, raising, splicing, combobulating(!). Once you get used to it, going back to editing other languages feels terrifically slow and constraining. (Aside: I&#x27;m really hoping the tree-sitter era brings this kind of power to most languages.)
 But lispy is also highly opinionated, and at times quite intrusive. It takes a bit of the kitchen-sink approach, tuned to one specific workflow, touching all manner of capabilities beyond the basics. It overrides outline regexes, and adds cust…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t seem to find any good resources on this. What kind of formatting and linting do you use on elisp .el source files? I&#x27;d like something which can run linting in flycheck, and hopefully run formatting in apheleia-mode.
 Is there anything like this out there? I&#x27;d love something like how flake8 and black work on python source. Thanks for the help!

                              <span>I do use evil with Emacs 27 and hs-minor-mode.
 When opening a Python file everything is unfolded.
  
I do evil-close-folds (z + m) to close all folds.
 Then I do evil-toggle-fold (z + a) to re-open the current fold (e.g. a class ...).
 And then I go in the next line and do M-x hs-hide-level.
  
The result may look like this:
 class Foobar: def folded_method():... def next_folded():... 
 I don&#x27;t know how to reach that result with less keys presses. This isn&#x27;t the focus of this question but maybe you have a hint? IMHO there is no vi-like &quot;(un)fold-all-in-this-level&quot; function.
 But I would like to add a vi-like (z plus something) shortcut to hs-hide-level also.
  
I&#x27;m not sure which shortcut I should use.
 I don&#x27;t know how to configure vi-like shortcuts.
  
My config looks like this currently
  (use-package evil :init (setq evil-want-integration t) (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (setq evil-want-C-i-jump nil) :config (evil-mode 1) ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers (evil-global-set-key &#x27;motion &quot;j&quot; &#x27;evil-next-visual-line) (evil-global-set-key &#x27;motion &quot;k&quot; &#x27;evil-previous-visual-line) ;; Set &quot;normal&quot; vi-mode in specific buffers (evil-set-initial-state &#x27;messages-buffer-mode &#x27;normal) (evil-set-initial-state &#x27;dashboard-mode &#x27;normal) )

 Is anyone else having this problem or might know a solution?
 I&#x27;m just using it without any modifications at the moment. In case anyone is wondering how I have configured it or what settings I have enabled.

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I have some org mode files containing denote notes for a bunch of papers that I would like to read, which each live in the root of my notes directory and have the tags _paper and _unread in their filenames.
 I would like to put a link in another org file (not a note) that would take me straight to a filtered dired view showing only these files.
 Has anyone achieved something like this, or do you have opinions about the best way to do it?

                              <span>I use a synced init.el on different machines. I do use eglot as language server which is started via hock in python-mode. But I want not to start it when it runs on a specific machine (maybe identified via host-name?).
 This is the relevant part of my init.el.
 (use-package eglot :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;C-c a r&quot; . #&#x27;eglot-rename)) :custom (eglot-autoshutdown t) (flymake-no-changes-timeout 5) ) (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) 
 I would assume it is the best to not activate the hook on a special condition?
 Pseudocode:
 (use-package python :hook (if host-name no &quot;quark&quot; then python-mode . eglot-ensure) ) 
 I have no idea how to solve that in Emacs Lisp.

I’m going to be a tax preparer, not a coder or anything. I find eMacs too bulky for my use case of just taking notes, but I’m still curious, I’ve heard it’s basically a separate operating system. So, what are your favorite things to use eMacs for (besides programming)?

                              <span>A whole 3 years ago my Emacs newbie frustrations led me to post Is elisp documentation going to get the equivalent of the user contributed notes at php.net?.
 The top comments were about the problems at the PHP site, so please read past them.
 I just looked at the shortdocs examples in Emacs and I see how define-short-documentation-group can be a great help if shortdocs are developed and shared collaboratively.
 All you have to do is to visit the site, browse them, select those you want, download and incorporate them into your system, and add yours if you consider them superior.
 If there is some voting the best groups in each set rise to the top to make it easier.
 Is the FSF going provide some infrastructure for this, or will it have to be Github or Gitlab?

                              <span>The title should be: How can I use emacs to indicate duplicated declaratives (AUCTeX)
 I use Emacs mostly for LaTeX. I would like Emacs to indicat lines where multiple usepackage commands with the same package in a project are used or at least in the same file; either using \usepackge[...]{...} or \RequirePackage[...]{...}. Does anyone know of there is any package for that?
 Currently, I test files using Python script because I am total noob at ELisp. 
 Thanks

There&#x27;s no indication in the mode-line. Opening pdf-outline doesn&#x27;t navigate to the current section, besides, some documents don&#x27;t even have an outline. what-cursor-position says it&#x27;s on point 1.
 So how do I get to know where am I in a book?

Intro: best game meets best editor
 Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is a turn-based strategy game released in 1999 that is still has an active multiplayer scene. It is the #1 turn-based strategy videogame of all time, according to Ranker.
 HoMM3 is a superb game for demonstrating iterative strategy refinement and documentation writing using Emacs Org Mode, because of HoMM3&#x27;s ergonomic hotkeys and autosaves.
 HoMM3&#x27;s hotkeys are honed by the multiplayer community, which plays timed turns, as in speed chess. The HD+ Launcher makes daily saves in tournament mode, allowing one to revert to any previous day. This is primitive version control for text, but excellent for a videogame.

                              <span>Does anyone have any elisp or package recommendations on calculating lead and cycle time for todo items? I&#x27;d like to also include estimate vs actual effort. 
 I&#x27;d like to be able to review a list of tasks (buffer only or across multiple files) to determine the difference between when they were created, time to completion, and time active (in a certain state). I&#x27;d like to leverage :LOGBOOK: properties. 
 My goal is as part of a weekly review see where my time got chewed up, refine my estimates of effort and become more efficent with my planning. Ideally I&#x27;ll extend this to include tags so I can add another layer like &quot;how long is it taking me to get to items tagged :admin: on average&quot;. 
 I&#x27;m new to elisp and happy trying to work on it myself but some tips or starting points of the best way to address the problem would be appreciated! 
 Example:
 * DONE An important task CLOSED: [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;DONE&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] CLOCK: [2022-05-20 Fri 10:00]--[2022-05-20 Fri 10:15] &#x3D;&gt; 0:15 CLOCK: [2022-05-22 Sun 19:30]--[2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] &#x3D;&gt; 0:30 - State &quot;TODO&quot; from [2022-05-15 Sun 20:00] :END: * Report | Task | Effort | Clocked | Missed | Lead Time | Cycle Time | |-------------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------+------------| | An important task | 0:30 | 0:45 | -00:15 | 7d | 1d |

                              <span>Current process: I&#x27;ve been using neovim for the past 6 years or so. Python coder 99% of the time, but I also dabble in rust, haskell, c++, and occasionally others. I&#x27;m relatively minimalist, I like to implement things myself if they&#x27;re simple, and I&#x27;d rather have 90% of the functionality of something if it means having 1 less plugin. I am a machine learning/signal processing researcher, so my code is very exploratory, and often not huge projects/codebases. My current setup is I have a lot of custom functionality to split my window in half left/right with a terminal or python/ipython REPL on the right side, and keymaps to send code, run the current file, compile, etc. Plots appear as pop ups, and when I close them they are gone unless I explicitly save them (or rerun the code).

 #+name: clean #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var in&#x3D;&quot;&quot; (flet ((clean (in) (if (listp in) (mapcar #&#x27;clean in) (if (stringp in) (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;¦&quot; &quot;|&quot; in) in)))) (clean in)) #+end_src #+name: regexps | first | (a¦b) | | second | (1¦2) | #+begin_src perl :var a&#x3D;clean(in&#x3D;regexps)[0,1] :var b&#x3D;clean(in&#x3D;regexps)[1,1] $a; $b; #+end_src #+name: : (1|2) 
 I&#x27;ve read flet is deprecated for being dynamic-global and not lexical -- or because cl is deprecated. Obviously, in the end it&#x27;s just replacing ¦ for |, but how can this be redone for these &quot;modern&quot; lexical times? In general, where can I learn modern lexical, cl-* oriented elisp? Pre- and post-lexical is confusing.

Of course this breaks basically every package, and makes my emacs workflow unusable. I&#x27;m very confused how this could&#x27;ve happened though, as I thought this was a core emacs function. Does anyone know what I should do? Wipe and reinstall emacs?

                              <span>I currently generate a table by exporting org-babel output to a file includeing the file like this.
 #+ATTR_HTML: :class LookupTable #+NAME: Functions and Docstrings #+include: ./funcstable 
 The org-babel is like this.
 #+name: funcstable :file funcstable #+begin_src emacs-lisp (generate-funcs-table) #+end_src 
 How can I convert it to a noweb system so the HTML block looks like this (assuming it is the right syntax)

                              <span>I would like to scroll left the buffer by a specific number of characters, no matter the zoom.
 (scroll-left 10)
 would scroll left by 10 chars, but only if the current text scale is 0. If I zoom in with C-x + / (text-scale-adjust)), then the same command would scroll less than 10 chars.
 I might be terribly wrong, but from this I infer that scroll-left&#x27;s argument is not the amount of characters. Indeed, the documentation says scroll-left&#x27;s argument 
  
Value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in effect after the change.
  
This begs the question: how can I scroll left 10 chars, regardless the current text scale?
 I tried playing with text-scale-mode-amount and text-scale-mode-step, miserably failing.
 Any hint? Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying out consult and am really enjoying it. However, as usual, there are always some adjustments to be done. In particular, I can&#x27;t seem to be comfortable with the behavior of consult-line. By default, it lists the candidates from point on, and candidates above point in the buffer are listed below, after the end of buffer one. This seems odd to me (or my preferences), and I&#x27;d like the search in the minibuffer to mirror the actual buffer: what is above is above, what is below is below. There exists the option consult-line-start-from-top, which I tried, and indeed organizes things this way. However, it also starts the search from beginning of buffer, which is not quite what I&#x27;d want. In the consult wiki there exists a snippet which produces the desired effect for consult-outline and co…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m perennially confused about use-package declarations and keywords, but what I want to do is the following:
  
  
Defer a package e.g. citar so that it doesn&#x27;t load at init time (but the function definitions are known).
 When I do call the package, it loads the other packages as well, i.e. citar also loads citar-org-roam and the associated :config setup.
  
 
 Here is what I have now:
 (use-package citar :ensure t :defer t :custom ... ) (use-package citar-org-roam :ensure t :diminish t :after citar org-roam :no-require :custom (citar-org-roam-subdir nil) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ...) 
  
 Is the right answer to use :requires citar-org-roam in the first citar macro?
  
  
 
 I am trying to speed up my init time, which was on the order of 20s, and now is around 9s, by deferring/lazy-loading some packages. I use Emacs in daemon/server-client mode anyway, so I don&#x27;t need superfast init times, but small changes help.

                              <span>hi everybody, 
 I am learning Japanese and I am tired of having to switch input-method in the OS (linux and MacOS) and then switch back to be able to run any emacs command. As long as I am typing Japanese the OS method works well, but the moment I want to run a Ctrl- or M- command, the moment I have to swich OS input method.
 So I noticed that toggle-input-method seems allows japanese input while allowing romaji commands without switching.
 If you use emacs for Japanese, what is your recommendation regarding Japanese input? Should I stick with the OS one, or use one of the many Japanese input-methods?
 Basically, I am looking for advice from people who have to deal with Japanese within emacs.
 thank you in advance,

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to finish setting up emacs for Java dev since I go back to college tomorrow. I&#x27;m experiencing an issue where it seems that my jdtls hangs at the starting process, as I open a .java file, enter M-x &#x27;lsp&#x27;, and then the the client tries connecting to the server to no end, saying it&#x27;s &quot;starting&quot;. Anybody got any solutions?

                              <span>Hello,
 I took just a couple minutes to scratch an itch I&#x27;ve had for a while now. I find my org agendas growing too large sometimes. I hesitate to remove things from my schedule because I don&#x27;t want to forget them. But sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to see it RIGHT NOW.
 Enter dired. I love dired-do-kill-lines to pare down my directory listings as I work on them.
 In the same spirit, I wrote the following (naive) function for getting rid of lines in the org-agenda.
 (defun alec-org-agenda-kill-line () &quot;Kills a line from an org agenda, like &#x60;dired-kill-line&#x27;. It does so naively, so be careful using this!&quot; (interactive) (read-only-mode -1) (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) (delete-char 1) (read-only-mode 1)) (define-key org-agenda-keymap (kbd &quot;M-k&quot;) #&#x27;alec-org-agenda-kill-line) 
 I&#x27;ve used it a bit and love it so far. For now I&#x27;ve just got this function for killing one line at a time. If I decide I want this to stay in my workflow, next comes more things &quot;inspired&quot; (copied) from dired like regexp marking and killing. Feedback welcome!

                              <span>202301041111 Making family podcast with kids
#podcast #children #memorabilia
Make a podcast with kids: maybe share with the family, but not public.
Then you have memories to look back on later as the kids grow up. Meanwhile, the family has something to listen to once in a while without needing to visit. This could e.g. keep grandparents that don&#x27;t live nearby in touch with their grandchildren, and a kind of conversation going. (Depends on the age of the child.)
Ideas for topics:
what questions (about life, the world) do you want answered?
what happened last week/month?
what are you playing right now?
just: what&#x27;s on your mind? -- free form talk
Idea from this story:

  
When my daughter was 8 we made a six episode podcast together just talking about stuff. We didn&#x27;t keep going, but revisiting the episodes is so nice. A couple of episodes had her 4 year old siblings too and hearing their tiny little voices and enthusiastic stuttering is bringing us joy.
I&#x27;m glad we did it, and I am now wishing we had more of these sorts of memories.

@nighthawk it was just at an age where they had heaps of questions and I could explain stuff to the best of my knowledge. We sat down and wrote down a bunch of questions on cards and then picked a card for each episode.

                              <span>I thought folks around here might enjoy seeing how the chat gpt ai responded when I asked it describe a zettelkasten.  Here it is without modification.

  
Describe a zettelkasten.
The zettelkasten system was developed by the German sociologist and philosopher Niklas Luhmann, who used it to store and organize his notes and ideas as he wrote and researched. The name &quot;zettelkasten&quot; comes from the German word &quot;zettel,&quot; which means &quot;slip,&quot; and &quot;kasten,&quot; which means &quot;box.&quot;
In a zettelkasten, each note is given a unique identification number and can be linked to other notes through the use of cross-references. This allows for the creation of a web of interconnected ideas that can be easily navigated and explored.
The zettelkasten system has gained popularity in recent years as a tool for organizing and managing knowledge, particularly among writers and researchers. It is seen as a way to facilitate creative thinking and problem-solving by allowing for the easy access and retrieval of ideas and information.</span>

                              <span>I have a file with several headlines, ie projects. Each project have several subtasks and during the day I clock time spent on each task. At the end of the day, I would like to create a clocktable depicting the time I spent doing these tasks (tasks that belong to different headlines in the file). I thought :scope file or :scope agenda would create such an overview on what I have spent my time on during the day. But I dont get it to work. The clock table only depict time spent on subtasks belonging to that particular headline.

                              <span>Hello,
 I took just a couple minutes to scratch an itch I&#x27;ve had for a while now. I find my agendas growing too large sometimes. I hesitate to remove things from my schedule because I don&#x27;t want to forget them. But sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to see it RIGHT NOW.
 Enter dired. I love dired-do-kill-lines to pare down my directory listings as I work on them. 
 In the same spirit, I wrote the following (naive) function for getting rid of lines in the org-agenda. 
 (defun alec-org-agenda-kill-line () &quot;Kills a line from an org agenda, like &#x60;dired-kill-line&#x27;. It does so naively, so be careful using this!&quot; (interactive) (read-only-mode -1) (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) (delete-char 1) (read-only-mode 1)) (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-k&quot;) #&#x27;alec-org-agenda-kill-line) 
 I&#x27;ve used it a bit and love it so far. For now I&#x27;ve just got this defun for killing one line at a time. If I decide I want this to stay in my workflow, next comes more things &quot;inspired&quot; (copied) from dired like regexp marking and killing. Feedback welcome!

 What I found out that works is to create org-export-filter-final-output-functions text filter (see below), but I somehow think there could be simplier solution.
 (require &#x27;ox-publish) (defun org-html-remove-spurious-dynamic-block-code (string backend info) &quot;Remove #+BEGIN: columnview...&quot; (when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend &#x27;html) (string-match &quot;.\+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local :skip-empty-rows t&quot; string)) (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;.\+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local :skip-empty-rows t&quot; &quot;&quot; string))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-export-filter-final-output-functions &#x27;org-html-remove-spurious-dynamic-block-code)

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to see the flymake + eglot messages in the same time in the echo area.
 what I setup:
 &#x27;(eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose)
 &#x27;(eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p t)
 the &quot;eldoc-documentation-functions&quot;: &#x27;(eglot-signature-eldoc-function eglot-hover-eldoc-function flymake-eldoc-function)
 I don&#x27;t see the result of the flymake-eldoc-function.
 What is wrong with this setting ?
 How to use the eldoc-documentation-compose ?

 Besides Irreal, Sacha Chua, System Crafters and Prot, what good rss feeds have you in your library that deal with emacs? Is there a collection of such feeds somewhere?
 Thanks for sharing

 I discovered embark, and it&#x27;s a great package. The only problem is that I don&#x27;t find it ergonomic. So I want to put the most used commands in the right place. The only problem is that I haven&#x27;t used embark enough to know what are the most important commands.
 Did someone by chance use, for example keyfreq, with embark for a while? 
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>Does anyone have any advice as to how to easily leverage any sort of concurrency in elisp?
 To be more specific, I periodically do a package list refresh and reload and my underyling package tech is straight.el. Even with the git commits for each repo limited to only 3 the process of pulling and applying updates locks up my emacs session for several minutes at a time. ( Let&#x27;s not talk about the complexity of my .emacs, mkay? ;) ) I&#x27;m hoping that I can defun a local function that might wrap that process up in some form of concurrency so I don&#x27;t have to go make coffee when I&#x27;m doing an Emacs package update.
 I&#x27;ve looked at just scheduling the refresh via midnight-mode but I don&#x27;t really want to make updates that frequently. I&#x27;ve also looked at idle timers but I don&#x27;t see a way to make the straight.el pulls pre-emptible and once the timer trips you are then along for the ride until the process completes. Lastly, I&#x27;ve looked into aio but I&#x27;m not good enough with elisp/maybe not smart enough to understand that API.
 Thoughts? Advice?

                              <span>Hi all! 
 I have been using eglot (built-in LSP client implementation) for a long time now, but recently have started to think about DAP, the debugger protocol. My workflow at work would be to write most if not all my code in Emacs, but when debugging, I would turn to Intellij.
 This is mostly because there is no built-in implementation of the DAP protocol in Emacs. Yes, there&#x27;s dap-mode, but it&#x27;s so strongly connected to lsp-mode that there have been multiple instances in time where people have shown interest in having DAP connected to eglot, the efforts have gone nowhere. 
 I&#x27;m not interested in starting a war between lsp-mode and eglot users, but as an eglot user myself, I would love to see these two communities work together to have a working and built-in solution. 
 Thank you all!

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I am struggling connecting to Libera chat server using VPN.
 Without VPN, I can log in automatically but if VPN is running, connexion is denied and I get an sasl error:
 -copper.libera.chat- *** Notice -- SASL authentication to a NickServ account with a verified email address is required to connect from your current network. Please seehttps://libera.chat/guides/sasl for configuration assistance.
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; ERROR from irc.libera.chat: Closing Link: gateway/vpn/protonvpn/account (SASL
 authentication to a NickServ account with a verified email address is required
 to connect from your current network. Please see https://libera.chat/guides/sasl
 for configuration assistance.)
 Connection failed! Re-establishing connection...
 So I read the specified Libera page but since I am using Doom Emacs, I really don&#x27;t to make this works.
 If I try to use the &#x27;(require erc-sasl), I got an error: file not found.
 Anyone can guide me through the right process, please?

                              <span>Hey, emacs noob here. &quot;treesit-install-language-grammar&quot; calls &quot;treesit--install-language-grammar-1&quot; which says that it creates the &quot;tree-sitter&quot; directory under the user&#x27;s emacs configuration directory if it doesn&#x27;t exist. However I didn&#x27;t see it do that, and I can&#x27;t see the code where it allegedly does that.
 Is this a bug? How can I report it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m still pretty new so maybe this is a dumb question - but I want to lmap over an ExceptT. Something like:
 lamp :: forall e e&#x27; m a . Functor m &#x3D;&gt; (e -&gt; e&#x27;) -&gt; ExceptT e m a -&gt; ExceptT e&#x27; m a lamp f ex &#x3D; ExceptT $ (lmap f)  runExceptT ex 
 Should I just leave it like this and use as a standalone function? Is it more normal to write the whole Bifunctor instance when you need it for a less common monad? Wouldn&#x27;t I get an orphaned instance error if I tried to define this instance since I cannot add code to ExceptT nor Bifunctor libs?

                              <span>Hi people,
 in Scala cats effect, lets say I have a function that takes an integer and returns its double. I want to write a functional program that calls this function and prints to the console the return value. More precisely I have the following simple code:
 def f(x: Int): Int &#x3D; 2 * x def program: IO[Unit] &#x3D; { val y &#x3D; f(2) // 4 IO(println(s&quot;result is $y&quot;)) // println has side effects } 
 My goal is make the program as generic as possible like the following:
 def program[F[_]]: F[Unit] &#x3D; { val y &#x3D; f(2) F(println(s&quot;result is $y&quot;)) } // won&#x27;t compile, what is F? 
 however of course this will not compile because is generic and we do not now what is F(something). How can specify some behavior on F and what should that be behavior be ?
 ​
 Many thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a GHC plugin that lets you take things like the following code:
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;Which argument would you like to print?&quot; index &lt;- fmap read getLine arg &lt;- fmap (!! index) getArgs putStrLn arg 
 and instead write this code:
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;Which argument would you like to print?&quot; putStrLn $ !getArgs !! read !getLine 
 This is heavily inspired by Idris&#x27;s !-notation, the main difference being that this plugin only allows you to use ! inside of existing do-blocks, whereas Idris will insert a do if it doesn&#x27;t exist.
 It currently works with ghc 9.4. You can find it here:
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monadic-bang-0.1.0.0
 Please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think!

                              <span>This is a follow up question from my earlier post that I hope can be answered separately without needing the complication of my earlier post.
 I got type M s &#x3D; ReaderT (PuzzleState s) (ST s), and a function canSolve :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; M s Bool. In that function:
 case () of _ | assigned -&gt; if sumDigit &#x3D;&#x3D; i then canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry &#x60;div&#x60; 10) else return False 
 The above works, but this doesn&#x27;t:
 fmap (sumDigit &#x3D;&#x3D; i &amp;&amp;) $ canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry &#x60;div&#x60; 10) 
 This doesn&#x27;t work either.
 pure (sumDigit &#x3D;&#x3D; i &amp;&amp;)  canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry &#x60;div&#x60; 10) 
 Both the expressions produce wrong recursion result. Why?

                              <span>I am looking for a PostgreSQL only database library that can be easily used by Haskell beginner. It is not for me specifically but few of the college undergraduate students I intend to mentor. They would be building a typical multi-tenancy system, so you can expect typical, &#x60;tenant&#x60;, &#x60;user&#x60;, &#x60;emails&#x60;, &#x60;clients&#x60;, etc. kind of models/tables. And of course, the application domain entities.
 Avoiding the cost of learning EDSL that many Haskell DB libraries provide, I found out that only postgresql-typed and postgresql-simple allow to write only raw SQL queries easily. As I extensively use pgtyped for production Node.js application, I am thinking about using postgresql-typed. While I could find many resources for postgresql-simple, the same cannot be said try for postgresql-typed.
 I was able to get running with postgresql-typed and execute typical CRUD operations, but I fear that it may not support few of the important PostgreSQL constructs down the line. Also, the database must exist at the time of compilation of the project which is different from pgtyped as it generates TypeScript files at development time which we commit in the repository. I also get the feeling that after a while compilation time could increase exponentially as more queries gets added. I am already counting 50+ queries (Good thing is that the queries are not dynamic).
 So, my questions are:
  
Are my concerns valid about using postgresql-typed? (Slow compilations, need for DB at compile time, etc.)
 Lack of literature/articles around it? (Building own connection pool abstraction, etc.)
 Or any other recommendation? (Sticking to plain SQL and not EDSL)
  
​
 P.S - Kindly redirect me to right forum if this is not a right place. I am just a trespasser in a Haskell community :D

Which tablets do you use for those purposes and integration?
Thank you very much!

 is is possible for Enter to open the current headline when you are in normal evil mode?
 In normal mode Enter does nothing, so I suppose one could remap it without risk?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 im starting out with org-mode and want code-blocks to be syntax-highlighted.
 On my system that works for some languages (e.g. python) but does not work for others (e.g. kotlin).
 What do I need to install and/or configure to get syntax-highlighting for kotlin?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I wonder how you guys think intuitively about fs2 streams with an effect F of the form fs2.Stream[F, Int]. From my understanding, F could be the IO monad of cats effect. But I can&#x27;t make sense of how IO is related to the stream. 
 Appreciate any hint :)

                              <span>lsp+dap mode works pretty well on very simple projects, I was able to lunch it and add breakpoints for main code. But I&#x27;m not able to configure dap for tests. With VSCode it&#x27;s only a couple mouse clicks, but when I run dap-debug-edit-template it give me this strange struct
 (dap-register-debug-template &quot;Test function&quot; (list :type &quot;go&quot; :request &quot;launch&quot; :name &quot;Test function&quot; :mode &quot;test&quot; :program nil :args nil :env nil)) 
 I have no idea what all these properties means and where are no documentation or examples about them. I was no able to find articles in medium or youtube videos, like this how to debug go tests in emacs with dap mode. My working project has very strange, legacy structure and dap give me Warning (emacs): Initialize request failed: Failed to launch error message.
 Please share your configuration or at least explain what all these properties means.

                              <span>Previously, when I used to use projectile-find-file, the choices I used to get were based on files in my git repo. I installed ivy-prescient do that my counsel-M-x will list recently used commands as first choices (instead of alphabetical sorting initially), but now, projectile-find-file shows me all files under project root, including build artifacts, which takes a noticeably longer time to build the list before I can start entering my substring of interest.
 I tried to look through projectile options, as well as prescient options, but could not find anything that can help me limit projectile-find-file to just git-ls files. Does anyone have experience with this?

The breadcrumbs work fine with doom-modeline disabled and doom-modeline works fine in LSP mode with breadcrumbs disabled. Using them both causes the UI to freeze. Any way to get both working?

                              <span>I have released a slightly updated version of labrat, a simple command-line program for printing labels with little cermony and that can be invoked from within Emacs or from a shell.
 You can read about it and how to install it on github here.
 This is from the README:
 
  
Motivation
  
I need to print labels. And in my case, mostly I need file folder labels. I typically want to print to a Dymo LabelWriter, of which I own several variants. The problem is that I work almost entirely in Linux, but the simple task of printing a file folder label has required opening a GUI application, such as the very fine glabels, or worse, switching to a machine running Windows or to a Mac to run Dymo’s proprietary GUI. The Dymo GUI is particularly irksome because it takes a long time to start up and demands that you register every time you open it.
 I wanted a way to print a file label from the command line, or even better, from within my editor, Emacs. After giving up looking for such a thing without success, I decided to write my own. Hence labrat. With it—after due configuration—printing a file folder label is as simple as:
 $ labrat &#x27;First Line of Label--&gt;And the Second Line&#x27;
 Or, you can preview the label in your previewer of choice (mine is qpdfview) by adding the -V flag:
 $ labrat -V &#x27;First Line of Label--&gt;And the Second Line&#x27;
 Even better, I have included with labrat an elisp file (labrat.el) that will invoke labrat to form a label with the text of the paragraph at or before point. So within Emacs, you can bind keys to the commands, labrat-print and labrat-view to print or view the current or prior paragraph as your default label. Thus, in Emacs, I have C-z C-l C-l bound to labrat-print and C-z C-l C-v to labrat-view, and I can type a label in any buffer and get it generated with very little ceremony.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m very new to Emacs, and I would want to learn it well from scratch and make it my own (instead of going for a ready option like Doom) write my own elisp, etc. Before then I&#x27;ve been using vim plugins on a various editors (Atom, Sublime Text, VSCode, AstroNvim config).
 Since I&#x27;m more of a vim motions user, I don&#x27;t want to bother myself with default Emacs keybindings that I&#x27;m going to change anyway. What is the best way to learn Emacs for such case? 
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>I am trying to setup a note-making system with Emacs+org-mode. 
 I have already set up a MediaWiki installation for note-making. Here is a view of categories, subcategories and wiki page. It&#x27;s very easy to navigate to any page I want by traversing the category tree. Organically, the categories and subcategories evolve over time. A wiki page can be under multiple (sub) categories.
 Category Tree in MediaWiki
 But installing MediaWiki means I need webserver+php+mysql stack, which I want to avoid if possible. If I have to backup, replicate, migrate, and update MediaWiki to a new machine it&#x27;s not going to be easy. On top of this MediaWiki wiki syntax also sucks. Despite all these headaches, I still see this setup as valuable for providing me with category tree navigation and knowledge hierarchy.
 I know there is org-roam but it&#x27;s not providing me these kind of dynamic category trees and allow a page to have multiple parents. For me these category hierarchies are more important than back links.
 I can use projectile + nested folders but I want the ability to one sub category available under multiple parent category. Creating and managing symlinks may work but it won&#x27;t scale if I have 300+ wiki pages which should be filed under multiple parent categories.
 MediaWiki also provides a breadcrumb of clickable category links like below:
 Wiki &gt; Subjects &gt; Computer Science &gt; Programming Languages &gt; Clojure
 Is it possible to achieve 
  
similar Category hierarchy, 
 navigable dynamic category tree and
 multi-parent subcategories (i.e a category or page can belong to multiple parent categories)
  
any ideas/pointers to solve this with Emacs?

                              <span>Hi everyone. I started learning haskell about 4 months ago and have been mostly using interactive and/or turning into binary using stack. I have been following a course offered by the university of helsinki which uses stack for mostly running standalone programs. I am now undertaking my first project on haskell and wanted to know which package manager I should start with - stack or cabal. Since I am starting out, I want to do it right. I am also interested in being a cardano developer and they mostly use cabal and nix (not sure what nix is) as far as I know therefore, would like to think about that too. Please tell me which is better as a beginner.
 Cheers.

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/socks, which is quite old, we use it now, but it doesn&#x27;t support SOCKS authentication that we now need to support.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-simpl, that seems even older, and seems like it&#x27;s not supporting authentication too...
  
Is there a decent SOCKS5 library with authentication support?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve a strange problem. I modified some code with a continuation (where the input parameter is a class), but the code now forces the type within the continuation. And it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 My example reduces to (this is not the real example)
 ​
 oldFunction :: Num n &#x3D;&gt; (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int oldFunction f n &#x3D; f (n + 1) 
 compiles
 newFunction :: Num n &#x3D;&gt; (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int newFunction f n &#x3D; f (floor n + 1 :: Int) 
 Doesn&#x27;t.
 It wants f to be of type Int -&gt; Int. I am surprised. I though the callee decided on the instance of the typeclass. If a f can take a Num it could take a Int . What am I missing ?
 (here is the full error)
 old.hs:5:22: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘n’ with actual type ‘Int’ ‘n’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: newFunction :: forall n. Num n &#x3D;&gt; (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int at old.hs:4:1-46 • In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(floor n + 1 :: Int)’ In the expression: f (floor n + 1 :: Int) In an equation for ‘newFunction’: newFunction f n &#x3D; f (floor n + 1 :: Int) • Relevant bindings include n :: n (bound at old.hs:5:15) f :: n -&gt; Int (bound at old.hs:5:13) newFunction :: (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int (bound at old.hs:5:1) | 5 | newFunction f n &#x3D; f (floor n + 1 :: Int) | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded.

 I am experienced in typescript and new to haskell. Had this thought today. Perhaps satisfies wouldn&#x27;t serve much use in haskell without subtyping, although maybe there are cases where type classes include each other and this could be useful. Interested to learn.

                              <span>Total beginner here, coming from imperative languages like c, python and have some basic familiarity of functional paradigm side from Javascript land but I wanted to get good at data structures and algorithms and I think functional paradigm will allow me to focus on actual complexity of algorithms rather than getting bogged down with imperative details. So I wanted to know if learning Haskell will help me do that as I am also learning rust but wanted to thoroughly understand functional logics in Haskell first (since its more expressive) than go implement functional style in rust.

And I cannot wait😁 To me any form of organization of stuff I recorded (notes, zettels) seemed futile, at least brittle. At least for long term use.
But I‘m sure, AI will help. It‘s a great area of application. Mem is already trying. More will follow.
Until then I‘ll just patiently record in a simple way whatever I find valuable. The current tool is not important, eg Roam or Obsidian or Mem or Notion. In the end the content can be either used across tools or exported so the AI can process it.</span>

                              <span>So as I&#x27;ve been doing some searching, looks like Haskell has a steep initial learning curve but gets easier later vs other languages which might have a simple curve initially but get more difficult later.
 Where is the point of intersection usually? At the 6 month mark? 1 year? 2? Certainly it may be subjective depending on what one finds difficult or tedious but aiming for a generalization here.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I think state machines of the type Input -&gt; State -&gt; (State, Output) are great. They are easy to reason about, and if run on a separate thread with access to a queue of Inputs they perform well too.
 Sometimes the state machine might need to do some blocking I/O before producing the output though, this slows down the processing of inputs.
 I&#x27;ve recently implemented and documented an experimental way of how we can write the state machine as if the I/O is blocking, but actually it&#x27;s non-blocking and inputs can continue to be processes while we wait for the I/O action to complete:

 I am looking for a light theme for org that
 - uses a white background (not some kind of gray)
 - does not use green text
 - is installable via use-package
 - uses monospace in code-blocks
 - has nice tables 
 Does such a unicorn exist?
 Many thanks!

 From what I&#x27;ve gathered from searching the web, it is not possible to add recurring tasks with a finishing date (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). So I was wondering how do you deal with this scenario, which I think is fairly common. Thanks in advance for all your help.

 I have not used orgmode for some time, but one of my new year&#x27;s resolutions is to orgmodify my life.
 As I have recently started to get into android/wearos programming, I need to collect a lot kotlin code-snippets, each possibly with extra-information on what to put into gradle-files and what sdk-version to use etc etc.
 Any tips on how to best organize that?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hey all!
 ​
 Edit: I tried solving this by adding an autoload to &#x60;smudge-connect-player-status&#x60; which seems to have possibly fixed THIS issue, but there is another problem with Oauth that makes the whole thing hang and I&#x27;m not sure.
 I&#x27;m using Pop! OS, with Emacs installed from terminal, emacs 27.1.
 I posted a few months ago about getting Vuiet set up. I liked it a lot, but it was very minimalistic. Really only good for mindlessly playing a handful of tracks, and at that, you kinda had to know who you were looking for. It also had a few weaknesses, like constantly throwing up my debugger every time a particular song&#x27;s lyrics couldn&#x27;t be found.
 I finally gave in and switched to Spotify from YT Music since my partner uses it, and also I discovered Smudge, which looks awesome!
 ​
 Thing is, it doesn&#x27;t actually work, because some functions are not defined yet. Something something spacemacs lazy loading. I&#x27;m not sure how to fix this but I know Spacemacs has some behavior which causes packages to not be completely loaded if they&#x27;re not invoked - I think somehow this is what&#x27;s causing the issue.
 So, I try to run: &#x60;global-smudge-remote-mode&#x60;
 This is the output:
 &#x60;smudge-connect-player-status&#x60; not defined.
 Any attempt to run another smudge function then causes emacs to hang indefinitely and it must be killed (That&#x27;s dangerous!!!)
 I also noticed that when I first launch emacs, I only have access to functions which are defined in &#x60;smudge.el&#x60;, not ANY of the dozen or so other .el files included with this repository.
 Only smudge.el functions on startup.
 So I&#x27;m hoping this is a relatively simple configuration change I need to make in order to load this package properly and prevent the crashes. Thanks everyone!!!

                              <span>I have a problem. I have a .org file full of headers. I want to include non-header plaintext at the very end. However, that plaintext is automatically absorbed into the last header. How do I separate that plaintext so it appears on its own?
 Example:
 *Header1
 *Header2
 *Header3
 [Plain Text that I don&#x27;t want falling under Header3]
 Thank you!

                              <span>In exwm, I often start up one sub-emacs process, using M-&amp; emacs. Most often this is for running my Telega. In every case, the buffer names of this sub-emacs process is &quot;E: &quot;, where that BUFFER-NAME is changes to whatever buffer is being visited in the sub-emacs at this time.
 Now, my goal is to have a key that will switch-buffer to that sub-emacs process whatever it is running, optionally starting the process if it hasn&#x27;t begun yet. What is the best way to switch to my &quot;E:.*&quot; buffer?

                              <span>I mainly write code in Common Lisp. 99% of the time, I have two screens with my window manager:
  
Window 1 - Emacs
 Window 2 - Kitty Terminal with Tmux
  
In my Emacs frame. It is split into 3. On the left I have 2 panes with code and on the right I have the repl.
 This setup is fixed. As in, it doesnt really change much. 
 I use the terminal heavily for a bunch of coding and non-coding things while I am coding. Having the terminal on a separate window is very quick for me to switch and do something.
 I am curious what other peoples terminal workflow is. How do you integrate the terminal into your workflow? If you use term or v-term, how do you make switching easy and seemless?

                              <span>Hi all - pretty new to emacs and emacs org-mode and hoping this is some silly thing that will have a quick fix. I&#x27;ve searched every way I know how here and elsewhere and cannot find a solution to this.
 I&#x27;m trying to set up per-file key words for an org-mode file and I keep getting an invalid read syntax error. This is what I have at the top of the file along with title/author
 #+TODO: TODO CANCELED | PENDING DONE
 The error: Invalid read syntax: &quot;#&quot;, 1, 1

                              <span>Sorry for the dummy question, I&#x27;m new to emacs and could not solve my doubts by looking at the docs.
 I&#x27;m trying to set a variable in a project dir-locals.el file, to configure projectile&#x27;s behavior.
 I reduced the content of dir-locals.el to a single line, this one:
 (setq projectile-project-run-cmd &#x27;(docker-compose up -d)) 
 But when entering the project, I always see the error message:
 Directory-local variables error: (wrong-type-argument listp projectile-project-run-cmd) 
 ​
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Is there a how to anywhere on how to setup web-mode with laravel/php and blade?
 I can&#x27;t seem to get it to work correctly. The syntax highlighting is all off.
 It does not seem to respect &quot;@php&quot; / &quot;@endphp&quot; and all other blade tags. 
 When I set the web-mode engine to php it only works if I use the &quot;&lt;?php&quot; tags.

                              <span>I just bought Galaxy Tab S8+. Great device, but I want my Org-Roam notes on it. I figured the best option is to get Emacs up and running, and it&#x27;s been a bit difficult. Tried Andronix/F-Droid/Termux option, attempted multiple times with Arch and Debian with various desktop manager options and failed.
 Do you guys run Emacs on Android? And I don&#x27;t mean just in terminal. I want a full-blown GUI that supports all the things Emacs 29 has - sqlite, etc. Is that possible or I just want too much?

                              <span>Here are a few light-hearted jokes that you could share with an Emacs user:
 &quot;Why did the Emacs user switch to Vim? Because they wanted to be able to exit the editor.&quot;
 &quot;Why was the Emacs user upset when they lost their cursor? Because they couldn&#x27;t find their point.&quot;
 &quot;Why was the Emacs user excited about the new release of their editor? Because it had a cut and paste feature.&quot;
 &quot;Why was the Emacs user upset when their editor crashed? Because they lost all their parenthesis.&quot;
 I hope these jokes bring a smile to your friend&#x27;s face! Just be sure to keep in mind that everyone has different senses of humor, so it&#x27;s important to be mindful of your friend&#x27;s feelings and to not overstep any boundaries.

                              <span>This has annoyed me for quite some time now and I&#x27;ve never found any solutions for it online. I&#x27;m using lsp-mode for C/C++, and I have some dependencies specified in a CMakeLists.txt.
 The problem: Emacs keeps complaining (I think it&#x27;s the language-server who is complaining about this?) about c-headers for the dependencies specified in CMakeLists.txt not being found.
 The solution I&#x27;ve been using so far is to manually put the include paths to these dependencies in a compile_flags.txt file. For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -std&#x3D;gnu99 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I./include
 Deps produced by cmake
 -I./build/_deps/webp-src/src -I./build/_deps/vec3_static-src/include -I./build/_deps/cglm-src/include &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, it&#x27;s kind of annoying to keep fiddling with these files all the time. Is there anyway to configure lsp-mode or whoever is complaining about missing C-headers to actually look inside the _deps folder created by cmake, without using a compile_flags.txt?
 Like a global system-wide compile_flags.txt ?
 Thanks!

 I can C-g and C-k and C-c C-c C-c. I cannot kill it on a boat, I cannot kill it with a goat. Not in a house or with a mouse...
 I don&#x27;t care if there is a running process there - in fact I probably want it to run to update my email. I assume that&#x27;s what it is doing.
 /shrug. 
 I mostly ignore it, but from time to time it grabs focus when I&#x27;m typing in another buffer and I need to re-focus the other buffer which is very annoying. The only way to make it go away is to quit and re-start emacs entirely, and to not run mu4e anymore.
 will never die

 ​
 The fonts seem off though, or maybe it&#x27;s just me. Can someone (in case you know what the problem may be) point me in the right direction on how to fix this? 
 ​
 When I say it feels off, it feels somewhat pixelated.

 In vim if you go into visual mode and select 5 lines and insert before the first line it will then insert before each of the lines selected in visual mode. This behavior doesn&#x27;t happen in evil mode.

 When working from home on my linux machine - I have all my org files on Dropbox. I store all agenda files, todos, references and stuff like that in those. Basically my whole life is in those org files. If I am away from a computer during the day I have an idea or I want to check my agenda - I can easily do so through an app called &quot;orgzly&quot;. All is well for now.
 Now imagine if I wanted to take notes while I am at work on a windows machine(I am an IT technician in a large factory. Also doing some development work, writing documentation for it, etc. A good code editor is a must)... I would of course also try to use emacs with org mode(writing in a word document and not having my shortcuts for text editing, hunting and pecking with mouse simply kills me). I…</span>

 After inspecting flymake.el, I can&#x27;t figure out how to change the face (foreground color) of the counters that appear in the mode line - see the link below.
 Any ideas?
 My searching -fu is weak for this problem. :\
 Thank you for any help!

 I usually update my OS before I turn off the computer. Started computer today and Emacs refused to start due to lbtiff.so.5 not found.
 Quick
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.6.0.0 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.5 
 (or recompile Emacs :)) fixes the problem; if anyone is experiencing the same issue.

                              <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;ve been using AucTex for awhile.
 I really like it for the most part, but I&#x27;m betting indentation issues that are becoming a bit unbearable.
 I&#x27;m getting way too much indentation on most environments, which breaks my yasnippets and hurts readability.

 And this is honestly something I could live with, but sometimes it just breaks altogether and decides to put 8 indents in the main scope and break everything.

 ​
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a proper solution for this. I even tried turning off indentation all together, and that didn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m new to emacs and I&#x27;ve just started using org-agenda and I have a question for you.
 Let&#x27;s suppose I&#x27;ve courses every Tuesday and Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00, starting on January 30, 2023, and up to march 18, 2023. I&#x27;m trying to enter this so that it shows in my org-agenda. I&#x27;ve done this in the following way:
 * TODO Biology class  :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: * TODO Biology class  :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: 
 When I activate the agenda view and go to yearly view (via the command org-agenda-year-view) I see the entries every Tuesday and Friday at the right time, but I also see them appear well beyond the LAST_REPEAT date that I fixed inside the PROPERTIES section.
 So my question is: am I understanding wrong the usage of LAST_REPEAT? Is this the expected behavior? What should I do to make those entries not show beyond a given day (i.e., once my courses are over)?
 Besides my particular question, I&#x27;m open to any suggestions as to how I could be doing this in a better/more practical way. I&#x27;m reading the manual online and this is what I&#x27;ve came up with, but it might be far from optimal.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>Recently I have seen two:
  
Dfinity: Their job ads are all Rust now. Anyone know why they abandoned Haskell in favor of Rust?
 Tsuru Capital: No longer Haskell. Here I can ask further about their &quot;code sample&quot; problem. That problem seems like the perfect use-case for Haskell (reading &amp; parsing large files in constant memory using the streaming and parsing libraries), yet they still abandoned Haskell. How can you do the same in Rust? I thought your only option is going back to manual for-loops.
  
Do you have other examples? A growing trend or just 2 anomalies?

 &gt; A set of words is written down in the form of an ordinary &quot;long-hand&quot; addition sum, and it is required that the letters of the alphabet be replaced with decimal digits so that the result is a valid arithmetic sum.Example:
 SEND MORE ----- MONEY 
 This equation has a unique solution:
 9567 1085 ----- 10652 
 A non brute force solution is to use backtracking with memoization. My choice is to use the State Monad along with mutable Vectors. What I&#x27;m having trouble with writing is the part where a number is assigned to a letter. The steps for doing that are:
  
Find the currently unassigned numbers.
 For each unassigned number, add it to the solution, and recurse.
 If step 2 returns true, return true. Otherwise, remove the number from the solution.

                              <span>Hi, everyone! I&#x27;m a DataEngineer working with Python and Spark for the past few years. I want to start some Scala code here and need some advice for getting a couple of books for starters.
 People say &#x27;Learning Scala&#x27; by Jason Swartz is good but way too outdated as it is from 2015.
 Others say &#x27;Programming Scala&#x27; by Dwan Wampler os too difficult to begginers and uses Scala 3.0, which is not widely used yet.
 And some say &#x27;Scala Cookbook&#x27; by Alvin Alexander is good but misses fundamentals as it contains only recipes and assumes you already know the basics.
 Anything I&#x27;m missing here? Any recommendations?

                              <span>Annually we gather over 300 attendees at Scalar and have a great time discussing Scala! As the CfP is closing soon, we invite you to submit your talk! 🙋
 📥 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZh-gG3Zb3AxECUOVzq8anoCPlrOUGdtjCtxerWpnANN1DfA/viewform
 We are looking for anything that you think might be interesting for a wider audience and that is Scala related:
 ✨ Maybe you are using Scala in a novel way? 
 🧑‍💻 Or you wrote an interesting open-source library? 
 🦾 Or you have a use case to share from a project you are working on? 
 ⚙️ Or maybe you just want to show what can be done with the Scala language and existing Scala tools?
 Our main goal is to start some interesting discussions during the breaks and the after party, and inspire people to explore Scala and the Scala ecosystem later at home 💭
 Hence we are aiming at 30-minute presentations. We expect the audience to be familiar with the Scala language and its basic concepts. You don&#x27;t need to have any previous speaking experience 👶
 In case of any questions or doubts, write us at scalar@scalar-conf.com
 We&#x27;ll be happy to help ❤️

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.

Abusing Constraints for Automatic Documentation by Sandy Maguire
Determining this by hand is tedious and error-prone, and worse, doesn’t stay up to date with code changes. Instead, let’s see how we can use the type system to eliminate the pain.
Binary search over floating point representations by Brent Yorgey
I got some good feedback on my last post about binary search, and thought it was worth a follow-up post.

                              <span>Can you provide me with tips on setting up emacs for full screen, multiple windows ? I like to use emacs with:
 - full screen with multiple tiled windows. (one window each for code, repl etc.)
 - be able to easily access a web browser, file explorer at the same time while looking at code in an emacs window. (and without having to shelf /iconify emacs). Are there emacs in-window solutions for these ? What do you use ?
 I think I&#x27;ve figured out how to setup the windows the way I like with various (split*) commands but still have not found a good workflow for mixing emacs with other tasks on my system...

 (setq auto-save-default nil)
 it&#x27;s as snappy as ever. I wonder if this is to do with me using gccemacs?
 Anyone care to comment?

                              <span>I use org-mode to create many of the documents I produce for both latex and html. However, I am having an issue that is the fault of the University&#x27;s content management system, and I am hoping there is a quick option in org-mode (though reading through the docs and source, I don&#x27;t see it).
 Basically, the CMS system first runs the HTML file through its own XML validator, which is rather stupid. There are two errors that prevent it from serving my ox-html output.
 First, the default ox-html mathjax declaration uses:
   
 But, technically, the async should be a keyword/value pair, async&#x3D;&quot;1&quot; (value doesn&#x27;t matter). I can fix that by customizing org-html-mathjax-template.
 Second, the default ox-html mathjax converter leaves the ampersand &amp; character untouched. This is valid and fine, except when one has to go through a stupid XML validator, which says that &amp; is the HTML start of a character code.
 Is there an option to enable ox-html to also convert &amp; to &amp; in mathjax formatting? Obviously, ox-html does that already for text. I can do it after the publish with some elisp, but that seems like a PITA (one I am willing to do though).
 Any suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>So i have been trying out https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge . the package is looking very good. But i couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to run source.organizeImports code action using any of it&#x27;s functions. If any of you guys have been trying it out or know already please help me out. My target is to bind a key to clean up unused imports.

                              <span>More and more I&#x27;ve become enamored of the idea that Emacs could be an interesting front-end for systems/infrastructure management via tooling like magit&#x27;s transient, hydras, consult-*, etc. The scenarios around Infrastructure-as-code, CM, CI/CD/orchestration tooling, and API interactions, well, it&#x27;s just a reformulation of the original use case for Emacs ... manipulating streams of text programmatically
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with API interactions via elisp specifically and, though I&#x27;m not a Lisp expert by any stretch, I can already see where elisp might not be as robust of choice for integrating with external systems as another Lisp variant (ex: Scheme? Common Lisp?). Particularly as it relates to concurrent operations, error-handling, and automated testing. I&#x27;m guessing it will eventually be beneficial to reach into tools written in Rust and Golang and other languages via methods other than stdout/stderr/stdin but that&#x27;s down the road a bit.
 So...the ask...any Lisp experts out there have insight as to which Lisp variant might be particularly good for:
 1) tight integration with Emacs and elisp
 2) integrating with other third-party APIs and particularly SaaS REST APIs
 3) ability to leverage non-Lisp ecosystem tooling with a level of effectiveness similar to, say, Python&#x27;s glue extensions 
 Note: Yes, Python is quite effective at this sort of thing itself and I did consider exploring how I could graft Python to elisp for this task. For now, I think I would like to stick with Lisps. If my motivation were purely practical I would probably skip straight to the Python route.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a vim user and looking to give emacs a try, mainly because of orgmode. Even though I know nothing about emacs, I don&#x27;t want to use a distribution like Doom because distributions are really hard to reconfigure. What I&#x27;m looking for is a config file that has features such as:
  
Sane defaults, where I can easily change some editor options like theme, font, font size, etc.
 
How to remap key bindings.
 
Plugin manager that does lazy loading and loads the config of each plugin from a separate file.
 
Installation of common plugins for completion, LSP, orgmode, git, the sort of things that almost anyone would need.
 
 I know such a request might sound ridiculous, but it&#x27;ll help massively in the initial phase.

                              <span>The 7.0 release of Texinfo included this little mention: 
  
. EPUB 3 added as an output format, selected with --epub3
  
Which means that you can now convert .texi into .epub. So you can now convert Emacs Manual, the ELisp reference and others to .epub, load them on your e-book reader of choice and go to the beach, the forest, or wherever.
 The process is quite easy, if you have Texinfo &gt;&#x3D; 7.0 installed (texi2any --version):
  
Download the Texinfo source of the manual you want to convert like the Emacs Manual
 Ask texi2any to convert it:
  
 TEXINPUTS&#x3D;&quot;.:.:&quot; MAKEINFO&#x3D;&quot;makeinfo --force --enable-encoding -I .&quot; texi2any --epub3 emacs.texi 
 Replace emacs.texi with the name of the root .texi file of the manual you are interested in.
 The results are quite good, I&#x27;ve been reading the Emacs Manual again this way.
 The FSF publishes manuals for most GNU projects along with manuals related to Emacs though Texinfo sources are not published for all of them, you&#x27;ll need to grab the release then.

                              <span>Recently, I am working on packaging Haskell web apps in docker containers for myself. I guess nix and stack together can do this pretty well, but that is a hell I&#x27;m not ready to revisit.
 I am on Arch Linux, so I figured I would try building the app locally and then copying it into the official archlinux image. Easy enough, and hey, &quot;everything works!&quot; But I encountered a strange problem when I deployed the container on an Ubuntu VM hosted in the cloud. I get the following error only in the Ubuntu vm and only when running a haskell binary that is linked with the threaded runtime:
 hello: internal error: Itimer: Failed to spawn thread: Operation not permitted (GHC version 9.2.2 for x86_64_unknown_linux) Please report this as a GHC bug: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug

                              <span>Once upon a purely functional time,
 There was a language that shone so sublime.
 Its syntax, a study in elegance and grace,
 Was a delight to the most discerning codebase.
 This language was Haskell, a work of art,
 Whose powers of abstraction were second to none.
 It offered a refuge from the mundane and the coarse,
 A place where programmers could unleash their force.
 With Haskell, the horrors of side effects were laid to rest,
 As code was lifted up to a realm of the blest.
 No longer were we slaves to the whims of state,
 But masters of our domain, no longer irate.
 Yet Haskell was not for the faint of heart,
 For it demanded a level of discipline from the start.
 But for those who persevered, the rewards were great,
 As they soared through the skies, their code first rate.
 So if you seek a language that&#x27;s pure and true,
 One that will elevate your code to something new,
 Then look no further, for Haskell is the one,
 A language that will surely have your code on the run.

For regular functors we have natural transformation of type forall a. f a -&gt; g a for some functors F and G, but I&#x27;ve heard somewhere here, that for ends, and therefore arrows, fullblown naturality will be an overkill, but I don&#x27;t see why yet (arrows are (strong) profunctor monoids, where the composition is defined as a coend). But how do we implement forall a b. p a b -&gt; q a b then, when we can only map p a a to q a a? Or does it require a more strong condition?

                              <span>I am currently hitting the very disappointing reality of Template Haskell. Given a Haskell function I want to generate a second one that is slightly different, for example:
 foo i [] &#x3D; [] foo i (x:xs) &#x3D; i : foo xs 
 should allow me to generate
 foo&#x27; i [] &#x3D; 1 foo&#x27; i (x:xs) &#x3D; 1 + foo&#x27; xs 
 that mirrors the recursive structure of the function. I CAN&#x27;T change the original function foo to use something like recursion schemes.
 My initial idea was to use TemplateHaskell, get the name of the function, lookup its definition and then change it accordingly. But as the documentation states
  
The Maybe Dec field contains Just the declaration which defined the variable - including the RHS of the declaration - or else Nothing, in the case where the RHS is unavailable to the compiler. At present, this value is always Nothing: returning the RHS has not yet been implemented because of lack of interest.
  
So my second guess was to use write a QuasiQuoter and surround the original function with it. I can use ghc-exactprint to parse the function, but that gives me a HsSyn AST, not a template haskell AST. I started writing a conversion function, but this very tedious.
 Is there a better way to achieve this? Is there such a function already?

                              <span>Another piece of fallout from Advent of Code. One of the problems was a cellular-automata-like problem. I initially used a Set to represent the items in the grid, but it had a runtime of about 6 minutes. I swapped out the underlying representation to be an Array of Maybe Automaton, and dropped the runtime to about 7 seconds.
 The bad news is that the code is even more imperative in style than it was before.
 Writeup on my blog. I think it serves as an example of how you can do imperative, state-mutating code in Haskell, and as a fuller worked example than some of the tutorials online.
 Anyone have any thoughts?

                              <span>Most mutable things in Haskell (IORef, STRef, TVar, etc.) share a common interface, which we can describe with a small typeclass:
  class Ref f m where readRef :: f a -&gt; m a writeRef :: f a -&gt; a -&gt; m () 
 There are some (seemingly) obvious laws:
  
(writeRef ref x &gt;&gt; readRef ref) &#x3D;&#x3D; pure x
 (readRef ref &gt;&gt;&#x3D; writeRef ref) &#x3D;&#x3D; pure ()
 (writeRef ref x &gt;&gt; readRef ref&#x27;) &#x3D;&#x3D; readRef ref&#x27; if ref and ref&#x27; are disjoint
  
It&#x27;s often convenient to package up a curried Ref dictionary:
 data Var m a &#x3D; Var { readVar :: m a , writeVar :: a -&gt; m () } instance Ref (Var m) m where readRef &#x3D; readVar writeRef &#x3D; writeVar refToVar :: Ref f m &#x3D;&gt; f a -&gt; Var m a refToVar ref &#x3D; Var (readRef ref) (writeRef ref) 
 Conveniently, this definition of Var admits derived instances of FunctorT, DistributiveT, and Applicativ…</span>

                              <span>The documentation for Data.Compact claims that:
  
Pinned ByteArray# objects cannot be compacted. This is for a good reason: the memory is pinned so that it can be referenced by address (the address might be stored in a C data structure, for example), so we can&#x27;t make a copy of it to store in the Compact.
  
ByteArray# is the memory form of Text and ShortByteString, meaning you can&#x27;t create a Compact of any datatype that contains Text or ShortByteString - including FastString. 
 But it&#x27;s not clear to me why that&#x27;s the case. We have a ByteArray#. It&#x27;s pinned, so we can pass that to a C program through the FFI. From my perspective, copying the ByteArray# to a new pinned location in the compact region seems like it should be fine?
 What if GHC did decide to copy the data? What sorts of warnings and errors could happen instead?

One of our services is running backgrounds jobs with a rather complicated amount of logic using DB tables to make sure only one instance of the jobs is running across our three service instances. I was hoping to remove all that code that requires maintenance. Is there a framework that can do this for us? I&#x27;ve done this in the past running the jobs in kubernetes directly but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll be an option here.

                              <span>What is the simplest way to perform a HTTP call from Outwatch that would conform to the architecture of this framework? Please treat this question as ELIP (Explain Like I’m a Pythonista with very limited understanding of functional concepts).
 The outwatch documentation shows how I can display dynamic contents based on Observables. The examples, however, show only observables that change their state via user action or timer ticks.
 I think I need to somehow create an Observable that would represent the query, so that when the query succeeds/fails the content of the page gets updated accordingly. I was thinking about using http4s library as this is what I use on the backend, but the documentation for http4s describes only very simple case of client code, where the calls are represented by IO[String] values that are synchronously executed. I also tried to search in Outwatch and colibri documentation, to no avail.
 I will be glad for both examples and theoretical explanations.

                              <span>I am watching this great talk by Daniel Spiewak motivating effects. In particular, there is a point where he mentions that you can&#x27;t do retries with Future, but you can with effects. Of course you literally can do retries with futures (e.g. here), but you risk repeating side-effects that aren&#x27;t properly contained in a transaction. Why is this not the case for effects?
 Example: say I want to log a statement then read a value from a database. In the case of a future retry, suppose the first attempt logs successfully then fails to read. The retry logs the statement again then reads from the database (successfully), resulting in two logs instead of 1. Why would an effects implementation only log once, supposing the same scenario?

                              <span>So like everyone else, I&#x27;ve been playing with ChatGPT, and for me, the most interesting thing it can do is help me understand code, or search for hard-to-find documentation.
 Here, I&#x27;ve asked it to describe to me what a function does. (This is code that I wrote myself.)

 It does a pretty good job! It even guesses that I might be matching against ~ because I&#x27;m looking for backup files.
 So elisp isn&#x27;t my main language; maybe I could be doing things better.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I have been using Corfu completion for quite some time now and one thing that annoys me so much is the beep on the first time the dropdown shows, no beeps after. I have already digged into corfu source code and it looks like the beep comes from somewhere else but somehow related to corfu. I have already test default completion-at-point and company and no beeps.
 Anyone have experienced similar issue and managed to silence it? ChatGPT suggested me to (setq corfu-beep-p nil) which is ridiculous. 
 Here&#x27;s part of my config: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (customize-set-variable &#x27;ring-bell-function &#x27;ignore)
 (use-package corfu :straight (corfu :files (:defaults &quot;extensions/*&quot;) :includes (corfu-history)) :custom (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto t) (corfu-auto-prefix 2) (corfu-auto-delay 0.0) (corfu-quit-at-boundary &#x27;separator) (corfu-preview-current &#x27;insert) (corfu-preselect-first nil) (corfu-on-exact-match nil) (corfu-min-width 80) (corfu-count 14) (corfu-scroll-margin 4) (corfu-popupinfo-delay t) :init (global-corfu-mode) (corfu-history-mode) (corfu-popupinfo-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;savehist-additional-variables &#x27;corfu-history)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am using emacs-plus@28 on mac.
 EDIT: Simply (use-package corfu) also beeps on C-M-i.

                              <span>I have managed to build emacs-30.0.5 from source on a RHEL8 system. This took a lot of effort and compiling of other libraries to make it work.
 ​
 Emacs GUI comes up and many of my packages start and run. The issue is, the font I want is not being picked up. I want to use Fira Code as a font. The ttf files are installed in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. I ran fc-cache for the system to detect them. fc-cache says there are 10 fonts in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. The desktop font selection tool sees them and is able to use them for other GUI elements. 
 ​
 When I use Options-&gt;Set Default Font it pops up a small GUI that only knows a few fonts. It does not start the system font selection tool. My home PC does bring up the system font selection tool.
 ​
 In my custom-vars.el, which is loaded by init.el I have the following:
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 &#x27;(default ((t (:family &quot;Fira Code&quot; :foundry &quot;CTDB&quot; :slant normal :weight medium :height 113 :width normal)))))
 ​
 This works on my PC at home, but not my RHEL8 computer. There are no messages in the *Messages* buffer and there is no *Warnings* buffer. The GUI comes up and runs with some horrible default font that is hard to read. 
 ​
 Any ideas on what I am missing or doing wrong? Is it something I missed in compiling emacs? Something I am not setting up in my environment?

                              <span>Has anyone told you that they&#x27;d like to learn more about this Emacs thing you&#x27;re always talking about? Does that fill your heart with joy and just a little bit of cringe when you know they&#x27;re going to be looking at stock Emacs with a blinding white background and non-standard discoverability? Do you jump in and say, &quot;here take this config file to help make things easier&quot; or the like?
 This little project was born out of that frustration.
 Presenting, Emacs Bedrock
 Yes, I am an Emacs evangelist, and all around me know it. (Sorry guys.) I vacillate between giving people too much help or too little, I think. The ideal is to encourage new folks just enough to get over the initial hump and get them figuring out what they need to customize to get Emacs to work for their specific needs.
 This is just a little side project for me. I&#x27;ve had the ideas for this bubbling ever since Emacs 29 packed in so many nice features I wondered just how many of my 3rd-party packages I really needed. (Answer: I still have over 100 installed!)
 This package doesn&#x27;t focus on setting a nice theme (though it does use modus-vivendi) or doing fancy package customization stuff. This aims to be brutally simple so that new users can inspect it and try it out.
 I&#x27;d love to get some feedback. Feel free to leave comments here or on the SourceHut issue tracker.
 (There is also a GitHub mirror if SourceHut doesn&#x27;t work for you for some reason.)

 I have searched online, but this seems rather specific.

                              <span>Hi all, I am using emacs 24.4.1 on a virtual machine on which I cannot install any additional packages so my configuration is very simple. I often have to work with very large files, a few hundred Megabytes and I find isearch to be really really slow to the point it is unusable. The files are opened with Fundamental mode, I tried disabling the Hi minor mode, I also tried to set the lazy-highlight variable to nil from a post I found on the internet as suggestion to speed isearch up, but there is no noticeable change. When searching the same files with vim/gvim the search is super fast and I am able to quickly jump through the file and find all patterns matching the string. Why is there such a huge difference between emacs and vim search? Is there a way to speed up emacs when working with big files?

 works well, particularly after custom defining additional file type pairs with

 However, it does not switch files when point in on include directive in c/cpp files. Setting

 (setq ff-ignore-include t) does not seem to have any affect whatsoever

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to write my own helm source that is alist. I&#x27;m looking at the documentation here https://wikemacs.org/wiki/How_to_write_helm_extensions#Separate_candidates.27_sets_for_searching_and_for_actions
 but it does not work for me. The differences in my case are:
  
I&#x27;m using function instead of static set. The function returns alist as in the example, but I receive/can get only the car of the selected item, don&#x27;t see the alist
 I&#x27;m using helm-comp-read, if this makes any difference
  
The docstring says
  
- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table. 
 For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of 
 candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil. 
 It can be also a function that receives three arguments: 
 the values string, predicate and t. See &#x60;all-completions&#x27; for more details.
  
looking at &#x60;all-completions&#x60; docstring does not make it clearer to me.
 edit:
 &#x60;helm-comp-read-get-candidates&#x60; has hint:
  
ALISTP when non--nil will not use &#x60;all-completions&#x27; to collect 
 candidates because it doesn&#x27;t handle alists correctly for helm. 
 i.e In &#x60;all-completions&#x27; the car of each pair is used as value. 
 In helm we want to use the cdr instead like (display . real), 
 so we return the alist as it is with no transformation by 
 &#x60;all-completions&#x27;.

In this menu I can navigate from person to person (father, mother and children). The box at the bottom shows the relevant metadata for the highlighted person.
 Any hints on how something similar could be achieved with Emacs? Is there a package to create menu screens, as were used in the old MS-DOS programs?

                              <span>Sometimes it is annoying to wait for emacs to send a larger email (potentially over a slower connection). Using async it is possible to send email asynchronously, but you may loose your email if something goes wrong. Emacs now has built-in support for sqlite which can be used as a safe and simple mechanism (sqlite supports accessing a DB using multiple processes) for inter-process communication between the main emacs process and the emacs process that async spawns and to persistently store emails to be send and errors that occur during sending. This also enables retrying to send an email that failed to be send. Furthermore, for queued emails we can flush them in parallel. 
 I&#x27;ve now put this into a package on github that tries to load mu4e, but does not fail if the user is not using mu4e, but gnus. This should work on Emacs 29 (sqlite support) for any email client that uses the gnus and smtpmail functions to send email. However, since this queues emails in sqlite anything that displays queue sizes would have to be adviced to use async-email-sending--num-queued-emails instead.

 Hi all, when I added a hook to enable paredit mode for eval-expression mini buffer, hitting  created a newline instead of evaluating the expression. Not sure how to fix this? Any ideas?
 Currently, if I remove this hook, then it works fine. But it&#x27;s really nice to enable paredit mode when doing some quick evaluation using M + :

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I have been preparing training videos for my team, specially, devs that have never used Scala, in this one, I recorded myself while implementing a feature, from the beginning to get it merged. This even includes some initial experimentation to make sure the feature works, creating some tests, and, finally, refactor the code to improve it.
 I hope it can be helpful for the community:

                              <span>Akif has been writing a new ZIO-inspired functional effect library from scratch to understand what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. In this presentation, he shows some of the techniques used, discusses his approach to error handling, and walks through the lessons from this exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ZNB2epqQhc8

  com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3-M5 
  com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3-M5 
 The highlight for this one is probably moving the little router from the &quot;templates&quot; package into core (and adding some documentation) so that there is a little router included in the vanilla version. The syntax for the d3-like component has also been improved, along with a few other tweaks
 Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M5
 0.3-M6 is likely to be out soon (at least before the 18th). That one might also get called &quot;0.3.0&quot;.

https://seanlawson.net/2021/08/save-quotations-zettelkasten-method/
I&#x27;ve tried searching in the forum, but haven&#x27;t found a suitable topic about.
I find some of the point make sense, althought in my practice I&#x27;m almost always rewriting things on my own, making very rarely quotes in my notes and tend to revisit my own writes rather than original sources more than one time.
I&#x27;d like to hear your position about, and if and how you use quotes, and how you balance advantages and drawbacks of using/not using quotes in your notes.</span>

 SimpleX Chat is developed in Haskell - without huge support from Haskell community and help from u/angerman it would not be possible.
 We will be hiring soon – let me know if you are interested!
 Some Haskell-specific challenges we need to solve:
  
reliability/security of Cryptonite
 memory leaks in networking stack
 compilation for the web
 and many more!
  
Version 4.4 added:
  
disappearing messages – the most frequent request from the users. To use them both conversation parties should agree to it, unlike in most other messengers that allow to send disappearing messages without recipients&#x27; agreement.
 connection security code verification – it allows to confirm that the connection keys/addresses were not substituted (man-in-the-middle attack).
 &quot;live&quot; messages – they update to all recipients as you type them, every several seconds.
 French language interface - thanks to users community and Weblate!
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

 A couple weeks ago I started building my own using conduit-audio and the Haskell wrapper for the WebRTC VAD, and the OpenAI Whisper model.
 https://gitlab.com/ludflu/vad-audio
 I&#x27;m getting ready to package it up and upload to hackage. Besides adding a demo video &amp; unit tests, are there any recommended changes people have that would make adoption/contributions easier?

                              <span>I have this code: 
 R1: h k p &#x3D; snd p &gt; k
 R2: filter _ [] &#x3D; []
 R3: filter p (x:xs) &#x3D; if p x then x:ys else ys

 ys &#x3D; Main.filter p xs

 R4: zip [] _ &#x3D; []
 R5: zip _ [] &#x3D; []
 R6: zip (x:xs) (y:ys) &#x3D; (x,y) : Main.zip xs ys
 R7: zip _ _ &#x3D; error &quot;ouch!!&quot;
 ​
 When I call it with &quot; Main.filter (h &#x27;3&#x27;) (Main.zip (error &quot;ERR&quot;:&quot;1&quot;) [&#x27;a&#x27;..]) &quot; i have an error. 
 I get the error that I pass to the map function. Execution returns the &quot;ERR&quot; error because it compiles: R2 -&gt; R3 which brings me to R4 because there is &quot;if p x&quot;. And I am interested in what is inside the map, so I go to R4 (fail matching pattern), R5 (fail matching pattern), R6 and inside R6 I find the error as x. 
 Is the execution correct?
 Thanks

 Now I need to include a color box in a mini page for which the latex code looks like this:
 \\begin{tcolorbox}[colback&#x3D;white,colframe&#x3D;dkgreen,sharp corners&#x3D;uphill] 
 But within org-mode, instead of creating a color box, the attributes are displayed as such. [colback&#x3D;white,colframe&#x3D;dkgreen,sharp corners&#x3D;uphill]. I don&#x27;t how to include attributes.
 Any help in this regard is appreciated.

 Can someone point me at the Right Way?

 (setq-default py-split-window-on-execute nil)
 in my dotemacs. I&#x27;m keeping the post for anyone else who finds this.
 Using &#x27;t&#x27; instead of &#x27;nil&#x27; would create a new window, but only if the relevant window wasn&#x27;t already up.
 __________________________________________
 ORIGINAL:
 I tend to code by having a python shell in one window, and the code in the other window, typically with a vertical divider between them. If I choose a region in the code window, and run py-execute-region (&quot;C-c |&quot;), it&#x27;s insanely annoying that a new window gets created each time, below the two existing windows, with the same code buffer in it.
 How do I save my sanity? Expected operation would be that the region gets executed in the python buffer, without creating any new windows.
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using python-mode.el or python.el. Is there any easy way to tell? Is there an easy way to choose one or the other at runtime? I don&#x27;t see any python-mode.el in my dotemacs, I&#x27;m not sure where any non-default version would be loaded.
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 25.2.2.
 I found this but wasn&#x27;t able to solve the problem, sharing it as a starting point for anyone else: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24119221/customize-window-splitting-in-emacs-python-mode

 Is there some way to set the value on a project, directory or file basis?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I set a goal of only using Emacs (where possible) and while I have been googling a lot to try and get things set up the one thing that I’ve not quite cracked is C#.
 Can anyone recommend any good (up to date) tutorials on setting emacs up for C# and omnisharp-roslyn?

                              <span>I have been watching Karthink&#x27;s org-auctex library for a while. While I was never able to get it working well for me I kept checking in on it because I so wanted faster latex previews in org. This morning I found that Karthink had a new repo org-preview which is amazing. It is super fast, worked for me out of the box, and centers display math! Plus it works with org-fragtog which I also love. 
 Repo says its still in very early development (seems to only be a week or so old) but figured I would share my enthusiasm about it. 
 (Thank you u/karthink!)

                              <span>I have already set up showing completion of regular org-mode TODOs in my agenda log, and I have the variables org-agenda-start-with-log-mode and org-log-done both set to t. However, I would really like it if there was a way to log completion of habits and repeating tasks in the same place. I am guessing it doesn&#x27;t work because when these tasks are done, the state doesn&#x27;t change from TODO to DONE, but I&#x27;m not aware of the way to get around this. Can anyone help? Thanks!

                              <span>I am really stuck with learning this bit of Haskell. I have a function that accesses the twitter REST api. 
 The issue I am grappling with is that the api sometimes returns an token for the next page. I need to loop through each of the individual calls until this token is no longer present. In imperitive programming this is a simple &#x60;while&#x60; loop. I am struggling to find a functional form that works.
 This is the current signature of the get_tweets function
  get_tweets :: NW.Options -&gt; IO TwitterResponse 
 where TwitterResponse is 
  data TwitterResponse &#x3D; Failed | Partial (String, TwitterApiResponse) | Final TwitterApiResponse 
 The String in Partial is the pagination token.

                              <span>Greetings fellow Haskellers,
 I&#x27;ve decided 2023 is the year I&#x27;m going to learn and become productive in Haskell. I installed everything I think I need through GHCup. I can make my own projects with &#x60;stack new&#x60; and everything works _okay_. HLS seems to need restarts from time to time, though. But in any case, I am working through Haskell in Depth and I can&#x27;t really work with the example repo at all. When I open the directory in VSCode, I get this fairly inscrutable error at the top of any file I open:
 : cannot satisfy -package z-hid-examples-z-contexts (use -v for more information) 
 Any call to \&#x60;stack build\&#x60; fails with a bunch of constraint violations. The output appears to be complaining about which GHC I am using. In short, I am wondering whether there is any up-to-date, authoritative guide I can follow to fix my configuration so I can work through this stuff. Examples on the web seem to be mostly a bit old and piecemeal.

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing an exercise that computes all primes up to a given n using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For learning, I decided to use mutable vector and monad. This is where things got really confusing because all the examples/tutorials/articles I found are either trivial, or over my head.
 The following code works, but I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to filter out the composite numbers without unfreezing the vector. My attempt to do so using forM and guard didn&#x27;t compile.
 Signature of primesUpTo is determined by the exercise and can&#x27;t be modified.
 module Sieve (primesUpTo) where import Control.Monad as M import Control.Monad.Reader (ReaderT) import qualified Control.Monad.Reader as R import Control.Monad.ST (ST) import qualified Control.Monad.ST as ST import Data.Vector.Unboxed ((!)) import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed as U import Data.Vector.Unboxed.Mutable (MVector) import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed.Mutable as VM -- You should not use any of the division operations when implementing -- the sieve of Eratosthenes. import Prelude hiding (div, divMod, mod, quot, quotRem, rem, (/)) type MyVec s &#x3D; ReaderT (MVector s Bool) (ST s) primesUpTo :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] primesUpTo n &#x3D; ST.runST $ do let n&#x27; &#x3D; fromInteger n v  do y  do -- y  Integer -&gt; MyVec s () mark x n &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [x * x, x * x + x .. n] v  do VM.unsafeWrite v (fromInteger i) False

                              <span>Hello Scala Family, I am new to scala and currently on symbol literals topic. I am getting this error 
 Index.scala:35: error: value nameField is not a member of Index.Person 
 code 
 object Index { class Person { val name &#x3D; &quot;Zoned&quot; def sayHello():Unit &#x3D; { println(&quot;Mockery&quot;) } } def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; { val person &#x3D; new Person val nameField &#x3D; Symbol(&quot;name&quot;) println(person.nameField) } } 
 I understand the overall definition of it and its use but it isn&#x27;t accessing the name variable inside Person class as It should be.
 Is there something I am missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used TickTick for years but it&#x27;s bloated in comparison to what I&#x27;ve seen with the Orgzly app on Android. I&#x27;m a non-coder. Do you think I&#x27;m going to run into problems using this app for task and project management without having coding knowledge? I also was wondering if there is a way to embed Orgzly into Notion. Eventually I&#x27;d like to learn something like Org Mode but for the time being I&#x27;m going to use Notion due to life being busy.

 Thanks for all your help!

 ​
 I have an MacBook Pro M1 and I am trying to configure mbsync. Previously it worked flawlessly but now it requires oauth2 and the only message that I got is:
 Error performing SASL authentication step: SASL(-1): generic failure: Unable to find a callback: 18948
 I register the application in Azure and edited my config.json but it doesn&#x27;t work. Do you have any hints what is going on?

                              <span>When I install a mode it will build the native eln file and use it.
 I&#x27;d like to build a version of emacs where there is no .el, .elc files just only .eln ones.
 What I mean roughly to remove the &quot;straight&quot;, &quot;melpa&quot;, &quot;elpa&quot; ... folders and load the modes from the &quot;eln-cache&quot; folder ...
 Can I make it ?
 Can I avoid the package manager from my version ?
 Can I put these files to the &quot;emacs program&quot; directory structure and use the &quot;.emacs.d&quot; only for the &quot;small/machine specific&quot; configuration changes ?
 Am I a wrong direction ? :D

                              <span>I recently discovered that the xdg-basedir library on Hackage only covered a very limited part of the XDG Basedir Specification, namely just reading the environment variables and returning paths for directories and files, and only for the categories or config, data and cache.
 But the XDG Basedir is so much more!
 First, there are other categories, state and runtime. Second, there&#x27;s a whole logic to what files should be read: either you want to read only one file, and the application should try each directory for the category and give you the content of the first file that is available, or you want all available files merged together. Also, relative paths in the environment variables should be ignored.
 So I created xdg-basedir-compliant. It was fun to create because thanks to Polysemy, I could easily do TDD with non-IO interpreters.
 I hope the API is practical. I do hope people will use the library and I would very much welcome feedback on its use!

 I was trying the 2nd day of AOC; and just for funsies i was trying to model the rock-paper-scissors game through a type-class (my motivation was that i didn&#x27;t want to update the result function if i were to extend the rock-paper-scissors with spock or some other variant). Nevertheless, I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out how to promote a value to it&#x27;s promoted-type (see result&#x27; at the bottom for the issue)

 Just looking for some feedback, get some clarity and to improve my haskell skills.
 This project I believe will grow into something bigger. I want to make it for different types of poker games and add in game theory elements to it. So this is more of a starting point. Right now it only supports Texas hold&#x27;em. I won&#x27;t go too much into the rules of poker, nor does it matter much, but say you have 2 cards and you want to calculate the odds of winning against any two cards.
 That means I need to calculate all combinations of 2 choose 50 &#x3D; 1225
 Then (say this is Texas holdem...if you know those rules cool, if not, all good, not needed...)

                              <span>Hey ... and happy New Year. Instead of going to an all night party this year I opted to release another update video about Game :: Dangerous, a game engine written in Haskell that I&#x27;ve been working on since August 2015. Since I last posted about it I&#x27;ve migrated the project to Haskell Stack and GHC 9.x, so the newer hybrid garbage collector is now utilised (and should bring noticeable performance improvements). In this video I explain a bit about the map development server I&#x27;m working on and give a brief demonstration.
 Following feedback from the community I&#x27;ve done a fair bit of refactoring. The code will probably still look pretty crazy in places but I&#x27;ve tried to tame the worst of the craziness somewhat. If anyone wants to give feedback I&#x27;d be interested in what you think of the recursive control structure in module HandleInput. Anyway, take it easy.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs, I decided to go with doom emacs to get something sort of ready made. But I just don&#x27;t understand why my copy paste commands are so messed up. And they don&#x27;t work either. I used F10 to get a visual on what the commands where supposed to be, since C-w, M-w and C-y did nothing. I don&#x27;t understand what S-delete means, shift-S-delete? Doesn&#x27;t work. And I note M-w is the normal key binding but it does not work either.
 If I turn on CUA mode and use C-x / C-c / C-v then it works with key commands, otherwise nothing really works. Incredibly frustrating. I was trying to get used to the normal emacs commands but turns out they where not even there. Might there be some addon in doom emacs causing this?

                              <span>When I switch to another branch, I would like to see the mode line updates the branch name, but it only updates when I do some actions. I&#x27;m thinking about using (run-with-idle-timer 0 1 #&#x27;(lambda () (force-mode-line-update t))) to do this, is this correct? I&#x27;m also worried if this would cause performance issues. Or is there a better way to do this?
 Thanks, and happy new year!

 I want to create faces for #+begin_notes, and #+begin_comment blocks. 
 I know how to create faces using defface, but I do not know how to integrate it with org-mode.

​
 Is
  
(other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
  
part necessary?
 ​
 Why it can&#x27;t be
  
(list (read-buffer &quot;Append to buffer: &quot;) 
 (region-beginning) (region-end)))
  
alone?

                              <span>If I have an admin account on a remote server, how do I execute a sudo command on the remote after logging in as admin?
 The main problem seems to be responding to the password prompt for the sudo user.
 I have been doing it as root after setting the ssh key for the session, directly in org-babel files where I use ssh root@host &#x27;command in a local script as well as remotely where I set :dir /ssh:root@host:~/workingirectory, but I think that is unsafe and I want to do it as an admin user with sudo.

Rather than opening file with new buffer, I want to open in split window vertically or horizontally with a keybind. Thank you

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m using Emacs 28 on Mac OS Ventura.
 I have installed tree-sitter cli from rust cargo, but when I try to call it from eshell, it said it cannot find the executable. It&#x27;s fine in the iTerm2.
 I have installed package exec-path-from-shell to copy shell&#x27;s environment PATH for Emacs to use.
 And I have checked the $PATH in the eshell which contains cargo binary directory and I can call tree-sitter cli using the absolute path.
 Any idea why eshell cannot find the executable? (I have also tried to add the directory to &#x27;exec-path but it still cannot find it.

                              <span>10 years ago I learned that no, I couldn&#x27;t just &quot;skip learning about Git&quot; and use timestamped zip files instead just because I&#x27;m only 1 developer. This shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone here. The benefits of Git speak for themselves, even for just 1 developer.
 Today, I had a strange experience. For a while I&#x27;ve believed that if you&#x27;re just 1 developer, only cabal is enough. However I came across a concrete use case where it&#x27;s not enough! Here&#x27;s what happened:
  
I wanted to checkout an old commit of my personal project and run it.
 BOOM. Everything went out of whack because another personal project on my local machine was now at the wrong commit! These two different projects were no longer in sync!
  
My friends. Doesn&#x27;t this prove the necessity of Nix, even for 1 developer? Just wanted to confirm with you before I go any further.

 fg &#x3D; C.fromGregorian year month firstDay &#x3D; fg 1 lastDay &#x3D; fg $ C.gregorianMonthLength year month allDays &#x3D; map WD.toWeekDate [firstDay .. lastDay] 
 There is a function periodAllDays (this commit) that seems to do what I&#x27;m doing above, but when I use it, I get an error.
  
Not in scope: ‘C.periodAlldays’ 
 Module ‘Data.Time.Calendar’ does not export ‘periodAlldays’.

                              <span>I find myself naming things with &quot;-able&quot; suffix. For example if I want to be able to pull out a &quot;Matrix&quot; type from a few different types I&#x27;ll create a &quot;Matrixable&quot; class. But I can&#x27;t help but notice &quot;Functor&quot;, &quot;Semiring&quot; etc...are not named &quot;Mappable&quot; etc.
 Anyone have any opinions on this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a zettelkasten noob.  This morning while in bed pondering zettelkasten and just ruminating in general the idea for this zettel popped into my brain.  So I grabbed my phone and made a fleeting note &quot;Life is a tickertape&quot;.  Later I came and composed this zettel.
While I&#x27;ve been trying to begin my zk with notes from sources with the hopes of building it up over time, I also very much want to capture these kinds of musings.  I fact it&#x27;s an eye toward this kind of thing that is my primary motivation to create a zk.
Since I&#x27;m still new to this, I&#x27;d like to start off on the best foot possible, so any advice about what I&#x27;m doing here would be appreciated.
Thanks!

  
Life is a Tickertape

Life is experienced moment-to-moment, like an old fashioned tickertape.  This is how we receive information.  Reading, lectures, podcasts, speeches, these are sequences of words.  Music is sequences of sounds.  Movies are sequences of pictures.  All of these represent bits of information that come in one at a [[time]].
Similarly, reasoning seems to be a series of logical steps that take us from idea to idea to idea until we reach a conclusion.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a zettelkasten noob.  This morning while in bed pondering zettelkasten and just ruminating in general the idea for this zettel popped into my brain.  So I grabbed my phone and made a fleeting note &quot;Life is a tickertape&quot;.  Later I came and composed this zettel.
While I&#x27;ve been trying to begin my zk with notes from sources with the hopes of building it up over time, I also very much want to capture these kinds of musings.  I fact it&#x27;s an eye toward this kind of thing that is my primary motivation to create a zk.
Since I&#x27;m still new to this, I&#x27;d like to start off on the best foot possible, so any advice about what I&#x27;m doing here would be appreciated.
Thanks!

Life is experienced moment-to-moment, like an old fashioned tickertape.  This is how we receive information.  Reading, lectures, podcasts, speeches, these are sequences of words.  Music is sequences of sounds.  Movies are sequences of pictures.  All of these represent bits of information that come in one at a [[time]].
Similarly, reasoning seems to be a series of logical steps that take us from idea to idea to idea until we reach a conclusion.
In contrast, our [[brain]]s seem to operate as an interlinking network.  At the lowest level it&#x27;s a web of interconnected synapses.  At a higher level our thoughts seem like a web of associations, similar to a [[mind map]].
Question: Since our experiences are sequential, but the organization of our thoughts is more of a network or web of associations, how to we integrate these concepts?

                              <span>Hey guys! I&#x27;m new to the forum and to all this Zettelkasten method. I&#x27;ve tried writing my first Zettel and I would apreciate if you could tell me what I can improve in it!  
I&#x27;ve written it in Portuguese and auto-translated it to English using Google Translator (imma be honest here, I&#x27;m too lazy to translate it manually lol).
As a first try I used a post from this Zettelkasten website as a reference to it and based on what I understood, I wrote this:

# The reading of a text must be accompanied by notes and writing

Understanding the content of a text and absorbing the knowledge present in it only happens during the active stage of reading, which is taking notes and writing about the ideas that the text presents. In a passive reading, where the text is just read, the information is retained for a much smaller amount and time, in addition to the fact that the main ideas are not worked through the reader&#x27;s knowledge.

Annotations allow ideas to flow and solidify in the reader&#x27;s mind, allowing them to retain longer and be able to question them to lead to new questions and answers. Writing allows the connections of ideas to be transmitted in words to paper or document so that others can read, understand and process these ideas so that new connections are established.

                              <span>Hi everyone! 
 Can someone please explain to me how I can &quot;style&quot; a (custom or built in) link properly? 
 What I want to achieve is basically some similar look, to what you can do with e.g. the :before element in CSS, where you e.g. display a little link icon in front the actual link.
 The icons can come from a font like e.g. Fontawesome and/or svg source.
 With the following code I managed to show an icon from all-the-icons, which I replaced with the letter M here for better readability. The problem with this is however, that it does not only change the word menu to an M inside the link only.
 (org-deflink menu &quot;Style and export for menu links&quot; [:face &#x27;(:box &quot;gray60&quot; :background &quot;gray95&quot; :foreground &quot;purple&quot;)]) (setq prettify-symbols-alist &#x27;((&quot;menu&quot; . &quot;M&quot;))) (prettify-symbols-mode 1) 
 The plain text looks like:
 Plain Text
 and the &quot;styled&quot; version of that input looks like:

 I don&#x27;t think eglot has the ability to show code lenses (unless I&#x27;m missing something obvious). So another package would have to take over, but I can&#x27;t find one other than the ones integrated for lsp-mode.
 Has anyone been able to have some kind of code lens with eglot? I&#x27;m open to suggestions!

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am an Emacs newbie, using it now for ~2months, and I am still with my mouth open everyday on how amazing it is. Thanks to all the people that have worked hard on Emacs and also plugin creators!!!
 I have created my own config from scratch after having used Doom briefly and Prelude extensively. This is working far better, and it&#x27;s teaching me a lot.
 On a side note, I would really appreciate feedback into how this config can be improved, best practices, better choices, etc.
 See my config here: https://github.com/averageflow/dotfiles/tree/master/joeTumbleweedIKEADell/emacs
 I use a variety of packages, including consult, marginalia, vertico, corfu and orderless, use-package with straight.
 I love orderless, and when I manually enable it, works wonderful, but for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t get properly activated in my setup (init.el) when following the documentation:
 (use-package orderless :custom (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless basic) completion-category-overrides &#x27;((file (styles basic partial-completion)))) ) 
 When I do (print completion-styles) it gives me just (basic). Somehow it gets overriden I think ?
 I&#x27;ve also tried to change that :custom by :config and to use the setq outside the use-package block, to no avail.
 So I have had to resort to
 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(completion-styles &#x27;(orderless basic)) ) 
 And this seems to work. But how can I / should I get rid of it this way? 
 Why doesn&#x27;t it work in the use-package declaration? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting to the point in working with my ZK that I have re-visited certain zettels several times - whether that is just to read the zettel or to &quot;finish&quot; it (if it was still in rough form, having the tag &quot;#unfinished&quot;), or to add information from new sources.  There could be numerous reasons.
My point, though, is that I don&#x27;t always want to update (or &quot;refactor&quot;) a zettel; sometimes I just want to (legitimately) expand it.  I&#x27;ve started adding dates to the new material and some zettels now appear as:
Date 1 (UUID) with original material.
Date 2 with new material.
Date 3 with even newer material.
This approach has an added advantage in that it allows me to see a progression in an idea - what did I write initially and what are my thoughts now?
Has anyone else implemented this practice?  If so, what is your experience with it?  Whether you have or not, do you see any potential benefits from doing this?  Any drawbacks?</span>

                              <span>I recently purchased &quot;Learn Physics with Functional Programming&quot; mainly because it involved doing 2D and 3D graphics which are topics I would like to learn more about in Haskell. For the 2D part it uses the gloss package which I built and ran without any problems. However, for the 3D part it uses the package not-gloss which seems to not be maintained anymore. When I try to build it using cabal I get the following error:
 [ 5 of 10] Compiling Data.Pair ( src/Data/Pair.hs, dist/build/Data/Pair.o, dist/build/Data/Pair.dyn_o )
 src/Data/Pair.hs:98:10: error: • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Monoid_f (Flip j o) (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this) • In the instance declaration for ‘Pair (Flip j o)’ | 98 | instance (Arrow j, Monoid_f (Flip j o)) &#x3D;&gt; | cabal: Failed to build TypeCompose-0.9.14 (which is required by exe:LearnPhysics from LearnPhysics-0.1.0.0). See the build log above for details.
 I tried enable FlexibleContexts in my .cabal file but nothing changed. I am not sure where to go from here and any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I tend to program with Rust/Ocaml/Python/PHP etc. But I just love the Haskell Language.
 The only thing that has been a deal killer for me so far has been laziness.
 Reading https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-12-strict-vs-lazy/ further convinced me that laziness just causes too much grief.
 I am eager to write strict Haskell. I understand the the -XStrict and Unlifted datatypes help with this. Actually it is interesting that -XStrict does not really cut it, we need unlifted datatypes..
 However, I want to be able to use libraries and preludes that assume everything is strict and/or unlifted.
 Is it possible in 2022 to write Haskell as it if it was a strict language like, say, OCaml? However, where are the strict monad transformer libraries, strict by default preludes etc. Every notable library seems to be lazy...
 I like Purescript -- a dialect of Haskell that is pure and strict. However, Purescript does not have such a lively ecosystem, mature tooling etc. like Haskell.
 I would love to be writing Haskell with Purescript like semantics. Any suggestions?

                              <span>The repo and explanatory blog post for the safe-money library are currently returning a 404, and it seems like the author has made a number of other repos private (or removed them). Does anybody know what&#x27;s up? I was under the impression that safe-money was a relatively popular library so I&#x27;m a bit surprised to see it sort of disappear like this.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve packaged GHC primitives like fetchAddIntArray# which expose atomic operations into sinle package that exposes a type isomorphic to IORef Int and supports a few operations that mutate it.
 For a common use case of multiple threads incrementing a counter it works surprisingly faster that TVar, MVar or ever plain IORef. Even more surprisingly, this counter is a faster single-threaded mutable integer cell than IORef. If you&#x27;re curious, benchmarks are on github.

                              <span>I&#x27;m completely new to Haskell, but as far as databases go I&#x27;m a big fan of Cassandra. I do see libraries for it but it seems really unclear how to actually use it.
 But since I&#x27;m completely new to the language instead of trying the climb mountains perhaps I should start with something more typical to wet my whistle.
 So what databases are the most natural to use in Haskell?

                              <span>I’m trying to implement the technique of creating “piles” of headings to mimic how people cluster papers together on physical desktops. This is distinguished from categorizing with labels in that it leverages spatial location.
 I seem to recall coming across a package that put coordinates into a property value and then could display the headings in a corkboard or desktop type view.
 It may have been a brainstorming package, or maybe a plotting package, but I can’t seem to find it, does anyone know of a package with a feature like this?

                              <span>Hi r/scala, I would like to ask if any of you have encountered this problem before
 While programming in Scala, whenever I encounter certain types of situations that would have thrown an exception while programming in Java don&#x27;t seem to be throwing any exceptions in Scala.
 A very simple example that doesn&#x27;t throw an exception for me is:
 val list &#x3D; (0 to 5).toList println(list(10)) 
 Surely this should generate an IndexOutOfBoundsException?
 Another example:
 val mappy &#x3D; Map(&quot;a&quot; -&gt; 5) println(mappy(&quot;b&quot;)) 
 This also does not throw any exceptions.
 My Scala version is 3.2.1, and my intellij version is IntelliJ IDEA Edu 2022.2.2 using the Scala plugin, and my project type is an SBT project generated by intellij, incase any of that is relevant.
 I have also tried messing with the intellij settings, turning on stuff like &quot;prohibited exception thrown&quot; since I saw online that something like that might help, but I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet. I&#x27;m thinking about trying to throw out my entire scala plugin &amp; installs and try again from scratch, but I figured I&#x27;d ask here first.
 ​
 Thank you very much

 Main changes from 0.9.12:
  
Implemented support for returning clause inside an async block: https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/ReturningClause.html
 Few bug fixes and workarounds against the 3.2.1 compiler behavior.
  
Also, support for probability monad (https://github.com/jliszka/probability-monad ) is added to cps-async-connect. Now it is possible to do probabilistic programming in scala with direct style: https://github.com/rssh/cps-async-connect/blob/master/probability-monad/src/test/scala/cps/monads/probability/ProbabilityExamplesSuite.scala )

 Anyone have any thoughts on how I did? Any suggestions for making better use of parallelism, or expressing it better?

                              <span>This is a cross-post from Discourse. The summary is: If I use GHC 8.10.7 with modern-uri then Nix picks a version of that package that&#x27;s incompatible with the base of that GHC. Cabal works just fine. Am I missing something? I know that I can override the modern-uri that&#x27;s used in pkgs.haskell.compiler.ghc810 but then I basically need to play human constraint solver.

                              <span>I decided to upgrade to ghc 9.2.5 now that hls 1.9.0.0 is out, however I&#x27;m having an extremely difficult time figuring out what exactly I need to change in my current project to make it work. 
 The project builds correctly when I have 8.10.7 set as default with ghcup as well as when I swap back to it after trying to get 9.2.5 to work. When I set the default to 9.2.5 and start VSCode with the project folder, hls errors and says that it can&#x27;t determine what compiler version should be used, which is fair I guess, but again I have no idea what I need to change because there isn&#x27;t any information in the .cabal file about what compiler version to use.
 When I try to build the project, I get this error
 cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: ghc-pkg dump failed: dieVerbatim: user error (cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: &#x27;C:\ghcup\bin\ghc-pkg.exe&#x27; exited with an error: ghc-pkg-9.2.5.exe: C:\\cabal\\store\\ghc-9.2.5\\package.db\package.cache: withBinaryFile: inappropriate type (not enough bytes) 
 and almost all of the solutions/advice I&#x27;ve been able to find online for dealing with that have to do with stack which I&#x27;m not using. The one that wasn&#x27;t about stack said to delete the project folder and clone it again from github but doing that didn&#x27;t work.
 Any help would be deeply appreciated. If the solution is to just uninstall everything including ghcup and reinstall with only 9.2.5, is there something I should change about the .cabal file in the project before I do that to make sure it works correctly after reinstalling?

                              <span>Hi,
 Recently I posted how could I figure out the face variable for LSP breadcrumbs. I solved it.
 I hope the following is helpful.
 TL;DR
  
Even non-elisp hackers can understand elisp. Don&#x27;t be intimidated.
 Thank you /u/CorysInTheHouse69 for the nudge.
  
Details
 /u/CorysInTheHouse69, politely, repeatedly mentioned I should consult the underlying code. They were right, that&#x27;s the right approach. Even for a non-elisp hacker, one can see patterns!
 I found the pattern in the doom theme (doom-themes-base.el) base code and saw the line (header-line :inherit &#x27;mode-line) That is, the header line is matching my mode line. That&#x27;s not what I wanted! Boom!
 Walking up the code, I see the following comment:
 ;;; Code: ;; These are used as a basis for every Doom theme defined with &#x60;def-doom-theme&#x27;, ;; as a set of reasonble defaults. They are intended to be overidden where it ;; makes sense to. 
 operative word overridden!
 In my init.el I override (header-line and now, I have what I want. \o/
 Here&#x27;s an example of my unit test:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. ... &#x27;(header-line ((t (:background &quot;blue&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) ...) 
 Go forth and hack!

 Since I&#x27;m starting to purge gpg out of my life, but do depend on it heavily for keeping my org notes and authinfo encrypted, I needed an epa/epg-style transparent encryption support for age (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). As such I ported the relevant epa/epg code and reworked it to work with age. 
 age.el provides transparent encryption and decryption support for .age files in Emacs, much like epa/epg support .gpg files. That means you can do all the things with .age files you&#x27;re used to doing with .gpg files in Emacs now.
 Like most of my packages, this is mostly written to support my personal use cases, but I&#x27;ve seen some other folks mention that they wanted to start using age over gpg, so have a look if this seems useful to you.

 emacs -Q --script build-site.el 
 It used to work properly, yet greedy as I am I decided to implement a couple of new features, and to achieve that functionality I decided to install straight.el:

                              <span>According to some post I read the behaviour of defvar has been changed in that it will set the value of an already set variable if the variable is used again in a defvar.
 I use defvar declarations in order not to get assignment to free variable errors and I wouldn&#x27;t want the existing values to be reset.
 I can&#x27;t find the exact post where I read this but if this is what I think it means it may cause me some problems.
 Can anyone clarify it?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a long persisting issue I&#x27;d rather get rid of if anyone can point me in the right direction. When I first start Emacs (whether directly or as a client) my screen is extremely compressed (screenshot below). If I reload configuration it displays normally.
 I am currently on 28.2 but this has persisted from 27.x. You can probably just make out in the screenshot that this is Doom emacs just in case that has any relevance.
 Here is the screenshot:

 Searches do not yield any help that I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;m honestly not sure where to look.
 Thanks in advance.

How do you take manual bib notes when reading from an ebook, that doesn&#x27;t have page numbers? My ebook reader does have what I guess you&#x27;d call &quot;screen numbers&quot;, but those change if I change the font size.  How do you reference a particular location in a book when page numbers are not available to you?</span>

14 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
I whipped up this short dashboard practicing my python skills and thought I&#x27;d share it with you. I use something similar for reviewing note titles and summaries. Something I want to concentrate on more.
Titles and a one-sentence summary of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I&#x27;m currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.

When I force quit the app, the file is then deleted from Google Drive or Dropbox. I can also delete the file from finder and The Archive picks up the changes.
I&#x27;m using the latest download of The Archive on on a Mac M1 Pro, Mac OS Ventura 13.1
Anyone had similar or know anything I could try.</span>

                              <span>I have a little puzzle for the Haskell community.
 Lately I&#x27;ve been experimenting with tagless final encodings (or object algebras in other languages) to build ASTs where previously I would have used a recursive ADT.
 This works great if you have a simple untyped AST. New terms can be added to the AST by adding a new typeclass that extends the base one. 
 However, what you have an AST presented with a GADT, with the types of your language encoded as a data-kinded parameter? You can still encode your AST in a tagless final way by using a higher-kinded type as the carrier, and this (as before) let&#x27;s us extend the terms of the language, but what if we want to extend the types?
 For instance, if we have a base AST for a simply typed lambda calculus, and we want to add products, we need both a new type constructor, and some new terms of our AST itself.
 Yet (as far as I know), it&#x27;s not possible to use something like a tagless final encoding at the type level.
 Has anyone thought about solving this kind of problem? My only thought was that this might be easier to do in something like Agda or Idris, but I&#x27;m curious what a solution to this in Haskell might look like.

                              <span>I tried to write a function that calculate log safely (exercise in Haskell Wikibook). Here&#x27;s what I came up with:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a safeLog x &#x3D; log x  0) 
 Then I tried to rewrite it in point-free style. After some tinkering, I came up with this version:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a safeLog &#x3D; ap (( 0)) 
 The function works correctly; however, I don&#x27;t understand how it works (specifically the concrete type of ap). Haskell language server showed that the concrete type of ap is:
 _ :: (a -&gt; Maybe () -&gt; Maybe a) -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe ()) -&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a 
 The generalized type of ap is:
 forall (m :: * -&gt; *) a b. Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b 
 As I understand it, ap requires a function, a type a and b all wrapped in Monad m. For example, if I have this function:
 foo &#x3D; ap (Just (+ 1)) (Just 2) 
 I understand that the concrete type of Monad m here is Maybe, and the concrete type of a and b is Integer. i.e.:
 _ :: Maybe (Integer -&gt; Integer) -&gt; Maybe Integer -&gt; Maybe Integer 
 But in the case of ap inside safeLog:
 _ :: (a -&gt; Maybe () -&gt; Maybe a) -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe ()) -&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a 
 I cannot figure out what is the concrete type of Monad m, a and b.

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading about arrays (Data.Array). 1D array construction is easy.  a &#x3D; listArray (4, 8) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  creates an array with minimum index 4, maximum index 8, a ! 4 &#x3D; 2, and so on.

 What is the (1, 1) for? I can see how nine integers can be split into 3 rows and 3 columns without needing the (1, 1).
 The only material even discussing 2D array type is this, and sadly it doesn&#x27;t answer my question.

                              <span>Recently I have no internet and the only way to spend my time interestingly was learning ELisp and writing smth. As a result I&#x27;ve created the following 3 plugins:
  
range-pattern - Range pattern for pcase
 random-generators - Functions to generate random numbers and data structures
 generators - Functions to generate data structures
  
But the most interesting part was understanding how to extend pcase. :) I am open to any suggestions and I am going to create more plugins for Emacs to enhance my and others experience while learning new things.

                              <span>Compiling in emacs is easy, but i&#x27;m getting tired of alt-tabbing to terminal to run my program each time i want to test something, I need a separate emacs command for running commands in eshell, that functions similarly to M-x &quot;compile&quot; and &quot;recompile&quot;
 So i wrote mini-script with M-x &quot;eshell-run&quot; and &quot;eshell-rerun&quot; commands.
 If anyone is interested i will create github repo and will probably try to turn this into a full package.

                              <span>So for my previous year, I used LibreOffice Writer which sufficed well enough for using symbols as well as sub and super script but since then I’ve discovered my dearest Doom Emacs and kinda fell in love with Org Mode; y’know how the story goes. My current problem mostly is I’d really love to use Org Mode for my Math Notes but I don’t know how to insert symbols or structure things like larger division statements, or anything with how to insert functions.
 I’ve heard things about LaTeX being the optimal way to get this done; seemingly Emacs should have some integration with this but I don’t entirely know where to start with that and I don’t actually know a thing about LaTeX so I was wondering if anyone could offer me guidance on how to achieve the optimal note-taking Emacs setup, and just how you lovely lads would go about this?

 What could be the culprit?

                              <span>Hi.
 Is there an emacs distribution, which upon startup would present itself as a full-featured organizer?
 What I&#x27;m looking for is something opinionated, not necessarily easily configurable even, but something that works and does the job¹ out of the box.
 ¹ the job I define as something done by conventional organizers (todoist, ticktick), namely:
 - manage todo tasks
 - attach text notes to tasks
 - set date on tasks
 - set tags on tasks
 - agenda view
 - calendar view
 - maybe something like org-gcal?
 - preferably evil mode
 I&#x27;m willing to invest only minimal effort into learning this opinionated way of using org-mode. I&#x27;m not interested in the endless feature-set emacs can offer. I may decide to tinker with the setup later. But I don&#x27;t want to do all the learning upfront.
 Does a distribution like this exist?

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing a deep dive into a product management framework, where I&#x27;m breaking down the necessary knowledge within each phase of that framework so that I can both produce better strategic &amp; planning documents for my team and to write blog posts to teach other product managers how to operate within this framework.
Image of Framework for Reference
It&#x27;s unclear to me how to productively capture this framework &amp; begin developing out within my Zettelkasten.  I&#x27;ve kept my ZK for ~6 months now, so I&#x27;m familiar with the framework (both from notes workflow &amp; ideas workflow perspectives).
Currently, I&#x27;m considering this method:
Create a note that contains the flowchart itself.
Branch off of this note by creating a new note for each Phase &amp; each document.
Dive into the methodologies &amp; techniques required at each Phase from there.
Am I on the right track?  Is there anything obvious that I&#x27;m missing here?</span>

                              <span>Hi ! 
 I&#x27;m trying purescript for the first-time and I&#x27;m using spago to manage dependencies and building. I&#x27;m compiling my purescript modules with spago, and I want to use them in a typescript codebase. I&#x27;m looding type information (of course) when compiling to javascript. 
 How would I proceed if I want to keep type informations on my compiled module ? Is there a way to generate d.ts for each module when building with spago ? Any advice about that ? 
 Thx :)
