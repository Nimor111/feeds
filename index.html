                              <span>Hello -
 I&#x27;m trying to export a fairly complex org document---figures; links; footnotes; etc.
 It exports to LaTeX just fine, but not to ODT (which I need to get to a DOCX).
 It ends without creating a file, sending a humongous chunk of text to *Messages* without any error messages.
 The chunk of text seems mostly to be footnote related stuff. Here&#x27;s a typical line:
 &quot; 0 1 (:parent #18)))) (footnote-definition (:label &quot;65&quot; :begin 470440 :end 470472 :contents-begin 470448 :contents-end 470471 :pre-blank 0 :post-blank 1 :post-affiliated 470440 :mode nil :granularity nil :parent #16) (paragraph (:begin 470448 :end 470471 :contents-begin 470448 :contents-end 470471 :post-blank 0 :post-affiliated 470448 :mode nil :granularity nil :parent #17) #(&quot;Toll, &quot; 0 6 (:parent #18)) (italic (:begin 7 :end 34 :post-blank 0 :contents-begin 8 :contents-end 33 :parent #18) #(&quot;The Entertainment Machine&quot; 0 25 (:parent #19))) #(&quot;, 11.&quot; 0 5 (:parent #18)) #(&quot; 
 I&#x27;m guessing my file has got a bad something somewhere, but I don&#x27;t know where to look. 
 For what it&#x27;s worth, every line of the *Messages* dump ends with &quot;#(&quot;
 Has anybody faced anything similar before?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the release of Kele 0.5.0, the spritzy Kubernetes cluster management package for Emacs. Changelog is available here.
 This release integrates Kele with the menu bar. With this initial integration, you can switch Kubernetes contexts and default namespaces from within the menu bar. Kele presents your available contexts and namespaces as dynamic sub-menus, freeing you from the need to remember exact names and typing them in by hand (similar to kubectx and kubens on the terminal).

 With this release, Kele is now also integrated with doom-modeline. By adding the k8s segment to your doom-modeline configuration, you&#x27;ll see current context and namespace information directly on the modeline. By clicking the segment, you can also access the menu bar, for the (menu-bar-mode -1) crowd.

 For more details, see the Kele documentation. As always, please open an issue for any peculiar behavior you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you&#x27;d like to give general feedback or throw ideas around.
 Thanks!

 As a follow up to this post I tried manually configuring the laravel-dev-tool server for blade templates.
 Here&#x27;s my config (I&#x27;m using Doom):
 (after! lsp-mode (...) (add-to-list &#x27;lsp-language-id-configuration &#x27;(web-mode . &quot;blade&quot;)) (lsp-register-client (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection (executable-find &quot;laravel-dev-tools&quot;) &quot;lsp&quot;) :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;blade&quot;) :server-id &#x27;bladels :priority -1))) 
 When I use this configuration and open a .blade.php file nothing happens. No server starts. It doesn&#x27;t even try to start a server as I see no messages related to LSP.
 If I change the &quot;blade&quot; language to &quot;html&quot; (which is bound to html-ls) it starts the server successfully.
 So I&#x27;m guessing either I&#x27;m missing something or have something not configured correctly.
 Can someone please try and help me figure this out?
 Thanks in advance.

I&#x27;ve tried some online solutions but nothing is working for me. I was using much more complex configs for lsp-mode and lsp-java and have settled down on this simplest.

                              <span>Hi there, 
 I&#x27;d like to have a &quot;do what I mean&quot; mouse navigation while coding and reviewing code (mainly typescript) featuring the following :
  
s- on an url in a comment open browser 
 s- on a type definition search for references
 s- on something opens definition
 s- on import opens the imports definition
 s- on a { folds it
 s- on a folded block unfolds it
  
Does someone have some lookalike setup or have pointers to quickly implement this?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I have a minor-mode which I use with org-mode buffers, the minor mode makes use of python expressions for example:
 * heading this is a test text &#x60;{True if 1 &#x3D;&#x3D; 1 else False}&#x60; this is another line 
 now I want the text inside &#x60;{ }&#x60; to be highlighted using python syntax, is this possible preferably using something related to font-lock-add-keywords ??
 I already tried poly-mode but it misses up all the org-mode syntax highlighting, and it makes emacs kinda laggy, but code completion when inside &#x60;{ }&#x60; is related to python. but no syntax highlighting.
 and here is the code I used to create the poly-mode :
 (define-hostmode poly-org-python-hostmode :mode &#x27;org-mode :protect-syntax nil :protect-font-lock nil ) (define-innermode poly-org-python-innermode nil :mode &#x27;python-mode :head-matcher &quot;&#x60;{&quot; :tail-matcher &quot;}&#x60;\n&quot; :head-mode &#x27;host :tail-mode &#x27;host) (define-polymode poly-org-python-mode :hostmode &#x27;poly-org-python-hostmode :innermodes &#x27;(poly-org-python-innermode ) )

                              <span>The following sequence may cause the problem of keyboard keys producing no key input: 1. Copy some text from a web page (with Edge or Chrome) 2. Paste the copied to a buffer of emacs with command of evil p (paste) 3. Saw in the minibuffer &quot;M-p is undefined&quot; 4. Then enter a key in any application in Windows would produce no key input at all. After the error, selecting web page URL from bookmarks into address bar of Edge/Chrome browser also have no effect. 
 How to investigate the cause of the problem?
 The problem is random, only happens sometimes. The emacs runs in Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL 2.

 The bindings are working for most of Buffers code like Java, C++, etc, but it does not work in Scratch mode,
 How can I make it to work in all modes? or scratch mode too?

                              <span>I have a global command &quot;M-l&quot; which prints &quot;hello&quot; in the minibuffer. I evaluate the following:
 (define-minor-mode test-mode :init-value nil :lighter &quot; test&quot; :keymap (make-sparse-keymap)) (define-key test-mode-map [t] &#x27;ignore) 
 and enable test-mode in a test buffer. As expected, nothing happens when I press any key. Even M-l does nothing and minibuffer remains clear. However, if I then evaluate
 (define-key test-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-j&quot;) (lambda () (interactive) (message &quot;hi fren&quot;))) 
 when I run M-j in the test buffer, I see &quot;hi fren&quot; in minibuffer, but if I also run M-l in test buffer, I also see &quot;hello&quot; in minibuffer. In fact, all M-modified global keys are now working. Why is this? 
 ​
 More to the point, what if I want to still have access to my global keybinds, while having special code for anything that is not defined in test-mode-map? 
 ​
 I could set the parent of test-mode-map to global-map, but then any keys that are not in test map and not in global-map are handled by global-map if I dont use the [t] option, and if I use it, any global keys not in test-map never reach global-map.

                              <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;ve come across haringsrob/laravel-dev-tools language server for editing Laravel Blade files. I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to use it with Emacs&#x27; web-mode ? 
 I use intelephense language server but would like to be able to configure emacs to use this language server when editing .blade.php files.
 Is this possible? How can I configure this?
 Thanks in advance.

 Up until now I have been using lsp-treemacs-symbols to get an outline view of my java files. This mostly works but because it depends on the lsp server to provide the information there can be lots of odd hiccups when for whatever reason that server is down or slow. An alternative would be to use imenu and imenu-list to provide this capability. But by default it doesn&#x27;t show as much detail as lsp-treemacs and in particular there were no field …</span>

                              <span>This works perfectly fine and snappy in X11, but on Wayland with the PGTK build, some emacs links don&#x27;t display the highlight when hovering with the mouse immediately, it takes a few seconds. Then there are some other links that do work immediately, which makes it even more odd.
 You can see this in the dashboard.el recent files or project list. It can also be spotted on treemacs. Links in org mode buffers seem to be instant tho. It is quite inconsistent.
 In any case, I am more interested in knowing how can I see what function is reposnsible for the mouse highlighting on hover. I tried to use the profiler, but the function doesn&#x27;t show up. I guess it&#x27;s very deep in emacs, something from the C core most likely which would be a bummer. I want to investigate why this issue happens in the first place.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>I am upgrading a lot of Scala 2.13 services up to Scala 3, and have encountered some codebases where reflection was used in unit tests to examine all the subclasses of a trait.
 For example, in 2.x the way to make enumerations was with a sealed trait and case object subclasses. We would often make a collection listing all types, similar to Java enum .values. In our unit tests we would want to make sure no subtypes were accidentally omitted from that collection, and we would use reflection for that.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;scala import scala.reflect.runtime.universe
 val classType &#x3D; universe.typeOf[Branding] val subclasses &#x3D; classType.typeSymbol.asClass.knownDirectSubclasses &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 This is gone in Scala 3 and I&#x27;m wondering if there is a simple alternative. I would love to spend a day or two learning the new Scala macro syntax but I don&#x27;t have the time right now to devote to that, just for this simple 2-line expression.
 One might also suggest just updating our 2-style enums to Scala 3 proper enums. That will solve some of our scenarios but we use this &quot;find subclass types&quot; in tests for other classes as well, not just enums. For example we might occasionally have a trait with many subclasses and we want to make sure we have written a certain kind of test for each of the concrete subclasses, and reflection can come in handy as a sanity check here.
 gzoller/scala-reflection seems popular but I don&#x27;t see any documentation.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started a Cabal project which consists of an executable and a single test-suite. In the test-suite I call the executable in a subprocess using System.Process.callProcess. 
 I&#x27;ve found that cabal test does not automatically rebuild the executable after its Main.hs has been modified. Hence tests were failing simply because the executable was out-of-date.
 It took me a while to figure out how to fix this so I&#x27;m recording the fix here. The Cabal file should look something like this:
 name: foo executable: bar main-is: Main.hs hs-source-dirs: app test-suite: tests type: exitcode-stdio-1.0 main-is: test.hs hs-source-dirs: tests build-tool-depends: foo:bar 
 The build-tool-depends line ensures that the executable bar in project foo gets built every time the test-suite is run.
 The comments on this Github issue suggest that this is the official way of ensuring that an executable is built before a test-suite is run. And this open issue is requesting the addition of a run-tool-depends field which would create a distinction between executables used when building a component and those used to running a component.
 Is there a better way of directly testing an executable with Cabal?

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
A deep dive into time-slicing vs time-sinks. I&#x27;m looking at this from the perspective of creating a flourishing life in the present moment and not as much from a formal &quot;time management&quot; perspective. I see that incrementally working on strategies for maintaining continuity and interest over time is what will make time-slicing sustainable, where my rigid thinking has led me to drop this practice in the past.
With the help of Matt Ellis at Grammarly Blog, I am studying the differences between summarizing and paraphrasing for academic research.
Books I&#x27;m reading:

The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>I just switched to wayland and replaced my older emacs package with emacs-wayland, and the only bug so far is that, while using the daemon, if I have a frame opened and I start a new one with a keybinding or a command, the one I opened before switches to the scratch buffer of the new one
 It only works with one at a time from how I&#x27;ve tested it but it&#x27;s very weird, this never happens in X11, does anyone know what it could be?

                              <span>Hello emacs community, no matter how hard i try i cannot seem to wrap my head around the idea of using hooks in emacs. I have two examples to provide. The one working and the other one not, although i&#x27;ve seen both in the documentation.
 First example: Defining a function and then passing in to the hook.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;emacs-lisp (defun my-c-mode-hook () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message &quot;C-mode hook loaded successfully&quot;))
 (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-common-hook &#x27;my-c-mode-hook) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Even though the message prints, the variables don&#x27;t seem to get the values.
 Second example:
 emacs-lisp (add-hook &#x27;c-mode-common-hook (lambda () (setq c-basic-offset 4 indent-tabs-mode nil electric-indent-mode nil) (message &quot;C-mode hook loaded successfully&quot; ))) 
 The second one, passing a lambda to the hook works. It also is the same for my latex-mode hooks.
 So my question is, what is the difference between the two methods and what am i missing here. If anyone wants to share a resource for working with emacs hooks it will also be really appreciated.
 On the note of hooks, i have a more general question. When using the setq-default it will set the variable globally if it can. tab-width for example if set with &#x60;setq-default does not apply to all buffers. But if it is passed with a hook it works. Correct me if i&#x27;m wrong but does that happen because the settings get overwritten by the major mode? That&#x27;s why you need the hook to overwrite the major mode defaults perhaps???
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hello, folks! Learning to use the awesomeness that is org-babel, having trouble finding my footing:
 Withing dedicated buffer for, e.g. emacs-lisp, I get neat docs, and auto-completion, lsp (in the minibuffer).
 Now I know that lsp-within-org-babel has a whole package dedicated to it, so I know that:
  
there&#x27;s no LSP within code block by default
 there&#x27;s a hack that&#x27;s experimental but it might work
  
Haven&#x27;t tried it, so this is me regurgitating google, basically, and I welcome corrections gladly.
 Now when I try the above example within org code block - I don&#x27;t get the same features. 
 Is this a natural limitation of org babel and I just shouldn&#x27;t go for literate programming if I need the features of a proper IDE?
 emacs v.29.2 distro - spacemacs
 ADDED: huh, found this by one of spacemacs&#x27; devs.

                              <span>I am writing some code that allows me to work on trees and have those trees printed out onto the buffer. Depending on which kind of node I am currently editing, I have a different keymap for different commands that apply to that node. When I switch nodes however, I want to switch the active keymap, but changing the mode-map I have does nothing, the old keymap is still active and the new commands do not become available. I could look up the command in a hashtable, but Im worried that is not as efficient as just using the keymap structures furnished by emacs. How should I go about this?

Also you can add your custom regex function (check colorful-extra-color-keywords-hook).
 Since this is the first package for emacs that I&#x27;ve ever made I would like to hear your comments, feedback and tips (since i&#x27;m not expert in elisp)

                              <span>Hi, I work in org mode using ess-r. I&#x27;m not able to lets eglot automatically start while I open the src temp buffer. Emacs recognize the major mode (ess-r-mode) but eglot do not start. I try to open a .R file and eglot start as expected, so the issue is relative the src buffer. Do you have the same issue? How do you menage it?

Gloss does have a type for key events, so it’s easy enough to code the typing functionality. However, it gets tricky having to add a new line whenever the text reaches a certain length as gloss does not render ‘\n’. Help pleaseeeee

                              <span>I would like to share a simple demo on how to use Haskell to build a backend API on Google Cloud Run for free. It&#x27;s a simple API built with Haskell and Scotty, containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
 🔗 Repo: https://github.com/mihassan/cloud-run-hs-demo
 Why This Project? I&#x27;ve been coding in Haskell for some time now mostly for toy projects. I really love coding in Haskell, but one thing I was missing is to easily share my work in a straightforward, cost-effective way to friends/colleagues. This setup, combining Haskell with Docker and Cloud Run, might not be ideal for a production-grade service but is great for demos and learning experiences - all for free.
 Project Overview:
 The project, cloud-run-hs-demo, is a basic Haskell application that uses the Scotty web framework to set up a simple API. This demo showcases how you can containerize a Haskell application using Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run, a managed platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.
 I am aware that the setup lacks many essential features like rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and DDoS protection. Also, there are many options for web frameworks, such as servant, yesod etc. and many database libraries. These are critical for production-grade services to ensure security and manageability. This project serves as a demonstration on how easy it is to get started.
 Features:
  
Simple Haskell API using Scotty.
 SQLite readonly database using sqlite-simple project.
 Docker integration for Cloud Run deployment.
 Static webpage as frontend for the API.
  
I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any experiences with similar technologies. Let&#x27;s learn and explore together!
 Happy coding! 🎉

 I am quite new to Emacs which is not helping either since I don&#x27;t know if it is an issue with how I am running it, if I am missing a package, or if the whole of Yololisp just doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 When I run the .sh, I get a long error message with &quot;Eager macro-expansion failure: (error &quot;Misplaced t or &#x27;otherwise&#x27; clause&quot;)&quot; being the only thing I can see that leads me in any sort of direction. The error message only stays up for a quarte of a second, though I grabbed a screenshot of what I can view before it vanishes.

 tl;dr -- Every lsp mode for emacs works great, under most circumstances you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.
 Seriously, if all you want to know is if lsp modes for emacs are good and if you should use one, the answer is yes, assuming it supports your language.
 Summary
  
lspce is the lightest weight, least intrusive of all of them, even less than eglot if you ignore the setup costs. It gives you the least ability to inspect what&#x27;s going on (I haven&#x27;t checked the project for a couple of weeks, but when I first installed it it didn&#x27;t even have the stderr output of the lsp that was running) but also feels the most transparent. Similar to lsp-bridge, you&#x27;ll see a big benefit on large projects with the potential to block your UI.
 lsp-bridge took the most work to set …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m having to write jsx/tsx, and I want the best possible experience dealing with this pesky syntax elements.
 What do you folks use these days? I&#x27;m basically hoping to improve the following aspects:
  
Typing jsx/tsx forms
 Folding
 Structural editing
  
 
For the first thing I probably can still use Emmet mode. Or maybe there&#x27;s something better now?
 
Since I&#x27;m already using treesitter, for folding I tried: emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold, but because I&#x27;m using Emacs 30, I had to use this fork: abougouffa/treesit-fold, see emacs-tree-sitter/ts-fold#48 for details. That though still didn&#x27;t get me the desired outcome. If I have a component such as:
 export default function Home() { return (  
  ... 
 
 and I try folding around 
, it folds the entire function body. Not sure why. In general, I&#x27;m not sure what to use for folding to make it work with treesitter - ts-fold/treesit-fold, hideshow, evil-fold, origami, bicycle, yafolding, evil-vimish-fold, or something else?
  
For structural editing I&#x27;m not even sure what would be helpful here. I&#x27;m thinking of trying evil-matchit, to quickly jump to beginning/end of an element, because evil&#x27;s % keybinding doesn&#x27;t support html tags by default, but that&#x27;s just one aspect. There are probably a few other things to consider?
  
What are your thoughts? In general, do you know of any other Emacs packages you&#x27;d recommend for web-development? Also, I noticed that not all the features of emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter went into core (again, I&#x27;m using Emacs 30), do you think it&#x27;s worth loading the package instead of relying on what&#x27;s already in the core?

                              <span>I&#x27;m updating an old .emacs-file for a colleaque for Emacs 29.
 There are keybinding (for LaTeX) which stopped working.
 Example:
 (fset &#x27;gamma (lambda (&amp;optional arg) &quot;Keyboard macro.&quot; (interactive &quot;p&quot;) (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote (&quot;\\gamma&quot; 0 &quot;%d&quot;)) arg))) (keymap-global-set &quot;s-g&quot; &#x27;gamma) 
 This returns now a &quot;Invalid function...&quot;
 Can anyone help updating them for v. 29., I&#x27;m not an experienced Emacs user and don&#x27;t know Lisp :)

                              <span>When I continue to hit backspace in eshell it removes the prompt elements. How can I stop this behaviour?
 A stack overflow post provides a solution for this issue for M-x shell namely setting comint-prompt-read-only to t but also a comment stated it should not happen for eshell yet it does for me. I could find no eshell equivalent variable.
 My eshell prompt is split across two lines. The first line shows my working directory followed by the git branch if relevant. (I also want to add venv info at some point.)The second line shows just # or $ depending on the user. 
 eshell-prompt-regexp is set at the default value &quot;[#$\n]* [#$] &quot; as it seems to match my constructed prompt but perhaps not? 
 Still on Emacs 27.1. Thanks for your time.
 Solution: here

In Rstudio, autocompletion work in console while debugging. Any suggestions or guidelines how to accomplish autocomplete in inferior ess while debugging? Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a project utilizing CMake with nested subprojects, structured roughly like this:  -Root/ --compile_commands.json --CMakeLists.txt --Build/ --Library/ ---src/ ----A/ ----B/ ---CMakeLists.txt --Executable/ (Depends on Library) ---src/ ----A/ ----B/ ---CMakeLists.txt  The hope is to start Eglot once at the root, and have it work for each subproject, but it doesn&#x27;t enable when opening the source code for each subproject. Enabling Eglot repeatedly simply starts multiple instances, treating every single subdirectory as it&#x27;s own project. Is there any way to have it treat the whole Root/ folder as a single project?

                              <span>How would I best go about setting up a note where I could take weekly journal entries and TODOS throughout my day.
 I&#x27;m thinking something like having the date as a level one heading and then being able to input the current time as a level two heading below it and in that I can track my journal entries and todos?
 I&#x27;m a beginner in emacs so please keep that in mind when explaining things or recommending things for me to do

                              <span>I have some academic notes with citations in org-roam. They used to be like Train (2009). Recently, when I modify and complie them into pdf, the citations are now in footnotes like1.
 1 Train (2009)
 I think I did not change my init file. The releant lines are
 (setq org-cite-csl-styles-dir &quot;~/snap/zotero-snap/common/Zotero/styles/&quot;) (setq org-cite-global-bibliography &#x27;(&quot;~/Dropbox/org/org-roam/my_library.bib&quot;)) (setq org-cite-export-processors &#x27;( (t . (csl &quot;chicago-author-date.csl&quot;)))) ; Fallback(the default option)) 
 I tried other csl bib styles and citation styles, they are all in footnotes. For now, I use
 #+cite_export: basic author author-year 
 However, this produces Train, Kenneth (2009). Not something I want.
 I did some search and still do not know what happened. I followed the articles
  
https://amerygration.com/Blog/citation_handling_in_emacs.html
 https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html
 https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202206141852
  
The author of citar posted something (https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11rmakl/comment/jca9iqt/?utm\_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm\_medium&#x3D;web3x&amp;utm\_name&#x3D;web3xcss&amp;utm\_term&#x3D;1&amp;utm\_content&#x3D;share\_button) related to my problem. But is no longer on reddit.
 This is what I got when I compile the file now.
 This part relies on [cite/t:@trainDiscreteChoiceMethods2009].

 This is the file I complied in February.

 I&#x27;m thinking something like this
  
(today&#x27;s date) *(current time) **(notes, journal entries, basically anything) *(todos)
  
How would I do this in emacs?

Like with implicit parameters...why the hell not just include all the arguments? Why are you leaving shit out to be picked up implicitly? This is just making the code insanely hard to read quickly

                              <span>Hello, as a 3 YOE I want to interview for senior level jobs on the Typelevel stack, however I am wondering what are the expectations from the interviewer perspective? And what could be the best way to properly prepare such interviews? As a starting point I am doing the RockTheJVM &quot;Scala and FP interview&quot; course but I am wondering if there are other resources or better ways to crush the interview.

                              <span>Hi Scala community, as a software engineer with 10 years of experience I&#x27;d like to know your opinion. What would you choose now if you were in my situation: Scala or Rust?
 A bit of context: last 10 years I was involved mostly in web development (backend) and I feel kinda burned out now. Everything is the same: create a CRUD, connect a DB, integrate 3rd party API etc. It feels like it&#x27;s not fun anymore, everything is the same and boring.
 Currently I have a Scala job that has nothing to do with FP and to be honest I quite like the language. I also like FP and spend some time every day to learn cats and cats effect, I REALLY enjoy it, something new and refreshing.
 But anyway, at the end of the day i realize that all these fancy things like cats and monads, although it&#x27;s fun, is just anothe…</span>

                              <span>I do not feel that github stars correlates with the quality of a project. That said popularity and be an &quot;hot topic&quot; helps even in a competitive industry in which we work, where should be easier recognise real value from noise. If we want that scala gain popularity and adoption we need to act individually, we can do a lot of things: contributing, advocating, etc. The easier way, but nonetheless effective, it&#x27;s just to star a github repository. So guys let&#x27;s the scala3 repo fly to the moon :D

                              <span>1YOE in Scala, I&#x27;ve accomplished a good level of confidence with FP and Typelevel stack but i can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;m a good scala programmer. I know that it takes time, also coming from a dynamical language like python doesn&#x27;t help. But I would like to improve at a faster pace, could you suggest me something? In my opinion what helps more is: personal projects, spend a lot of time reading working on code and reading other people code. Anyone has some advice? Everything is accepted: books, courses, also personal advices or ideas about what worked for you..thx in advance

                              <span>I had a look for Scala podcasts -- and could not find any current podcasts dedicated to Scala. 
 Everything I found is two years old or older. Only related current podcast I dug out is: Happy Path Programming with Bruce Eckel &amp; James Ward (which actually is a good one).
 Is there anything else current?

I have the following that I plan to add this to when activating a custom mode.
 (defvar marc-font-lock-defaults &#x27;(;; MARC leader (&quot;^.\\{24\\}&quot; . font-lock-constant-face))) 
 I don&#x27;t think I can do this with a regex. What other options do I have, and can you point to some examples? Thanks.

                              <span>Does anyone can share experiences using second mate? Or some other FOSS alternative similar to copilot that can be integrated with emacs?
 If the first: - How was/is the experience using it? - Does it work with languages other than Python?
 If the second: - Which one (if you can share a link it&#x27;ll be useful). - With which language have you used it? - How was the experience?

                              <span>Out of the blue Apple introduced a global shortcut for creating quick notes in Notes App: Control Q. It‘s supposed to be Fn+Q, but on my MacBook Pro it‘s Ctrl+Q. 
 Now this intereres with a lot of shortcuts in my Emacs setup. For instance with C-c C-q (toggle edit in dired mode). 
 Does anyone know how to disable Apple‘s global shortcut? I don’t want to delete Notes app, as I am using it.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s fashionable to lazy load as much as possible in order to minimize startup time, but what&#x27;s the best way to do the opposite?
 I&#x27;m almost always going to want at least one org file open, so I&#x27;d like to eagerly load org-mode on startup and pay the cost then as opposed to being interrupted by an annoying hitch when I&#x27;m trying to open my first org file.
 My first two theories were:
 (use-package org :demand t) 
 and
 (require &#x27;org) 
 but neither worked.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve finally got my own configuration built and a fairly decent working understanding of Emacs. I followed the System Crafter&#x27;s Emacs From Scratch YouTube playlist and then branched off into my own thing.
 I&#x27;m now wondering if there&#x27;s anything that I should exchange from that baseline configuration? 
 There&#x27;s a package that Neovim has that I&#x27;d love to have in Emacs called oil. It&#x27;s a buffer based directory and file tree modification system. 
 So those who are more familiar with the meta of Emacs packages right now, would you be able to recommend some packages that I should exchange with what I built from this config mentioned above?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t have stable access to the internet all the time and this causes me to stress when I learn something online, so I prefer to download resources, for example I downloaded the python documentation and it works as a site, I can click titles as if I&#x27;m browsing online, and also downloaded the freecodecamp chapter_ed video. 
 I notice that Haskell Also has great documentation, playground and the &quot;try Haskell!&quot; tutorial. but I don&#x27;t see ways to download these resources. Also I can&#x27;t seem to find an extensive video tutorial as it is the case with Perl, Python or C which I downloaded. 
 So tl;dr I already think online Haskell resources are great but, I need, for my special case offline resources that are as good.

                              <span>Like many before me, I love &quot;The Archive&quot; Mac app and am lusting for an iPad/iPhone version. I understand the limitations of small developers, but I was wondering if there would be additional incentives to create this if we were to get a &quot;crowdfund&quot; amount going on Kickstarter or something; if financial backing were high enough (you name the amount you need), we could collectively &quot;hire&quot; you guys to develop the iPad app.
I suspect the addition of AI-backed tools could start to reduce the hours required to achieve such a task, so perhaps an additional financial commitment from the community would make it worthwhile and eliminate any financial risks on your end, Sascha &amp; Christian.</span>

                              <span>I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Org&#x27;s datetree structure, the most recent switch (from love back to hate on this occasion) being only two days ago. No doubt I&#x27;ll flip back again, but it&#x27;ll be short lived. If any given use of it lasted more than 10 weeks, I&#x27;d be surprised.
 So I was impressed to read u/github-alphapapa&#x27;s answer to a recent question, on org-ql:
  
You may also consider using datetrees in a smaller set of files, e.g. one file per year, or even for multiple years. My log.org file goes back over 10 years, ...
  
I&#x27;d be interested to hear (from the estimable u/github-alphapapa himself, but from anyone else too):
 In what way(s) do you find datetree to be useful and worth sticking with?
 TL;DR
 For context, and perhaps to head off at the pass answers like &quot;Coz it&#x27;s.…</span>

                              <span>Digging into org-ql and its pretty amazing to say the least.
 What i&#x27;m trying to do is query some org files I use for my personal review periods. I&#x27;d like to do a query that looks for additive tags not or based tags but I&quot;m not sure how to structure the query.
 An example:
 I&#x27;d like to be able to search my org files for items tagged say :FEB:2023:Accomplishment: if I use those tags via tags:Feb,2023,Accomplishment it gets things tagged with all the combinations not the 3 joined together to be more restrictive.
 If it&#x27;s helpful to understand I organize my reviews by month such that the 2023-02-Feb.org file has the FEB and 2023 in the filetags at the top of the file and then I have 4 headings within each file Week1,2,3,4 each with the same structure.
 If I can limit to just those tags then sorting by parent should then auto organize the month into week 1/2/3/4 sections in the org-ql view.
 Thanks in advance for any help!
 p.s. Additionally is there a way to have org-ql search a directory not just a set of individual space separated files?

                              <span>I have been killing myself trying to figure out what is going on here. I wrote a function to match for every reference in an org file to a word, then replace it with a link back to the org roam node. However I am having an issue.
 ​
 The function
 (defun link-name-to-org-roam-file (name filepath)
 (interactive &quot;sName: \nsOrg-roam File path (relative to Org-roam directory): &quot;)
 ;; Debugging: Print the filepath and name to *Messages* buffer
 (message &quot;Debug: name &#x3D; %s, filepath &#x3D; %s&quot; name filepath)
 (let* ((org-roam-dir (file-truename (expand-file-name org-roam-directory)))
 (full-path (expand-file-name filepath org-roam-dir))
 (link (format &quot;[[file:%s][%s]]&quot; full-path name)))
 ;; Debugging: Print the full-path again right before replacement
 (message &quot;Debug: link before replace-match &#x3D; %s&quot; link)
 (save-excursion
 (goto-char (point-min))
 (while (re-search-forward name nil t)
 ;; Debugging: Print what is actually being replaced
 (message &quot;Debug: replacing match with &#x3D; %s&quot; link)
 (replace-match link)))))
 ​
 The following are the debugs that get printed to the console:
 ​
 Debug: name &#x3D; Jane, filepath &#x3D; book1-characters-jane.org
 Debug: link before replace-match &#x3D; [[file:/home/john/org/RoamNotes/book1-characters-jane.org][Jane]]
 Debug: replacing match with &#x3D; [[file:/home/john/org/RoamNotes/book1-characters-jane.org][Jane]] [28 times]
 ​
 ​
 However when I cat the org file from the CLI, the links in the file actually look like this:
 [[File:/Home/John/Org/RoamNotes/Book1-Characters-Jane.Org][Jane]]
 Because of this the links do not work. I know the issue is not the function, could there be some addon or function to org mode that is capitalizing all the links?

                              <span>Maybe I compiled emacs without an option to speed up image viewing, but when compared to other pdf viewers, there is an annoying amount of lag when just scrolling a 4 page document. I have the same problem with docview, even when launching emacs with the -Q option. Turning off line number mode, as suggested by other answers, does nothing for me

                              <span>I switched to company + vertico + consult + marginalia + orderless a couple of years ago. I always run bleeding-edge emacs 30 compiled from source (I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, been doing it that way for 30 years). 
 Now I see corfu has become a good simpler alternative to company, but I&#x27;m unsure what the difference is between corfu &amp; vertico, so I&#x27;m not sure if I can dump company or not. Minad says &quot;Vertico is the minibuffer completion counterpart of Corfu&quot; but what does that mean really?
 In my mind I think of company as a completion provider (on top of capf) and vertico as the UI for it. But corfu is a UI for capf, right? So do I still need vertico? And I assume I&#x27;ll still need consult, I couldn&#x27;t live without consult-buffer.
 I know I should just try it &amp; see what happens, but any pointers would be helpful.

                              <span>I try to run after restart transient that includes ffdata, I receive the error that FFData isn&#x27;t loaded; and when I try to load it by manually evaling its use-package statement, it says that emacsql isn&#x27;t loaded. So, I can get everything loaded by evaluating my emacsql use-package, and then my ff-data use-package. But why do I have to do this every load time? I thought I could get around it by using :after and :demand but for some reason this doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything. I like to pretend that order doesn&#x27;t matter in my init.el, so I would like to avoid repositioning them in some other order.
 Here are the important lines I am trying:
 (use-package emacsql :demand t) 
 and above:
  (use-package consult-ffdata :after emacsql :straight (consult-ffdata :type git :host github :repo &quot;chen-chao/consult-ffdata&quot;) :custom (counsel-ffdata-database-path &quot;/home/torysa/.mozilla/firefox/aabkj82t.default/places.sqlite&quot;) ) 
 Why aren&#x27;t the demand and after statements working, and why do I have to manually evaluate those lines to get things to work properly?

                              <span>A few months ago, I found a website that had a few different customized starter kit versions of emacs for download. I have been looking for that site again but can&#x27;t seem to find it. I am mainly looking for it because one of the configurations was customized for creative writing with all kinds of packages for creating novels, managing biographies, and world building. They also claimed snippets for org mode to insert LaTex that would get you most of the way to what is needed to publish an ebook. 
 I don&#x27;t remember everything they said it did, but I mainly use emacs for programming and org mode related things. I really wanted to take a look at the configuration and packages to see what was included. I want to add some creative writing tools to my emacs config, and I was hoping to save time scraping elpa and trying different things, by testing their starter-kit out and then stealing the best packages and workflows which I could modify and add to my own config for my own purposes.
 Anyways if anyone has seen anything like that Please point the way.

                              <span>My question is a bit more general this, but help me understand the best way to namespace some code:
 I work for the National Solar Observatory. We are NSF funded, and my team processes data from the DKIST solar telescope. I&#x27;m excited to build tools for this in Haskell.
 FITS is the digital format used for telescope images. I&#x27;ve been contributing to the fits-parse package, which uses Data.Fits as a namespace, but my needs are growing beyond the scope of that package. I need to add support for the ASDF file format (containing metadata for many FITS images) and for the World Coordinate System (WCS), among other things.
 So I&#x27;d like to make a new package containing all the tools one might need to work with astronomical images from modern telescopes/observatories. How should it be namespaced?
 There&#x27;s an existing package that uses the Data.Astro namespace: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/astro. The fits-parse package uses Data.Fits
 Let&#x27;s assume that I create a single package for this, and name it telescope. Should the code be namespaced under Data or not? If yes, should I use a different namespace than the Data.Astro that the astro package uses?
 Option 1: Pick my own Top-level Namespace
 import Telescope.Fits import Telescope.Asdf import Telescope.Wcs 
 Option 2: Add packages to existing namespaces like &#x60;Data.Astro&#x60;, which is used by the &#x60;astro&#x60; package
 Note that the &#x60;astro&#x60; package deals with calculating the position of celestial bodies, which is every bit as as valid a use of the word astronomy, but has a very different focus from my work to process astronomical observations.
 -- from this package! import Data.Astro.Fits import Data.Astro.Wcs -- from &#x60;astro&#x60; package import Data.Astro.Sun 
 Option 3: Pick a new namespace under &#x60;Data&#x60; to differentiate from the other packages
 import Data.Telescope.Fits import Data.Telescope.Wcs 
 What&#x27;s the right approach here?

                              <span>After 1 year of studying haskell, I decided to write small library which parses command line args.
 And since I haven&#x27;t had much experience in haskell, I would ask your help.
 I would ask you all to see the code and mention what I can improve, maybe there is somewhere memory leaks or performance issues, or maybe you have some your own best practices of how to orgranise the code and so on and so forth.
 I haven&#x27;t made tests and benchmarks, yet.
 I haven&#x27;t move String to Text yet.
 Also, I left the example in the example folder and also I left comments in the code so you might understand what is going on there
 So, I please you very hard, look on the code and make your suggestions/advices. And, please, look on example folder, I made question there about existential type
 And sorry for english here and in the comments in the repo, English is not my native
 thank you

                              <span>Now I&#x27;m writing a small application which manages some files in linux for my hobby.
 So I have tried to implement an abstraction of IO Monad to test as my file managing functions like below.
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hs
 imporrt qualified System.Directory as D
 class (Monad m) &#x3D;&gt; FileManagerMonad m where
 moveFile :: FilePath -&gt; FilePath -&gt; m () doSomething :: FilePath -&gt; FilePath -&gt; m ()
 data FileObj &#x3D; File | Dict [FileObj]
 data AppPure &#x3D; AppPure
 { appDir :: FileObj
 }
 instance FileManagerMonad (Reader AppPure) where
 moveFile src dest &#x3D; do
 // do logical file moving onto appDir as same as &#x60;D.renameFile&#x60; of directory package. 
 doSomething src dest &#x3D; do moveFile src dest // do something.
 instance FileManagedMonad IO where
 moveFile &#x3D; D.renameFile doSomething src dest &#x3D; do moveFile src dest // do something as same as for AppPure. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 After I wrote that, I have wondered that this implementation is meaningless at all because my FileManagerMoand implementation for AppPure is enable to be misimplemented and I don&#x27;t want to test removeFile directly. I&#x27;m satisfied to D.renameFile function in actual usage.
 But I am not good at Haskell programming, I want to know that I should create an IO monad abstraction for just imitation like a unnecessary mocking in testing context.
 Though I think that should write or not is depended on contexts absolutely, I have no idea how to decide it.
 Sorry for my stupid noobie (poor English) question. If I was gave some comments, so pleasure. Thanks.

                              <span>Hello everyone! Recently, i&#x27;ve started to program using the new C standard and i&#x27;ve been having some issues because my lsp server ( clangd 16.0.6 ) does not recognize some stuff from it ( nullptr for example ). Anyone had similar problems / knows any fix? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello I&#x27;m a really new user to emacs, literally just downloaded lol and don&#x27;t really have any experience with coding or programming. Is there a way to make setting up the app easier or any tips people could give me? 
 I was also wondering how the notes are organised, are they organised by different pages like something in obsidian or is it more of an atomic way like logseq? 
 Linked to the idea of organisation can I organise things via tags and links and stuff instead of folders because of ease of use and things like that because in obsidian my workflow was based around tags instead of looking through specific folders to find my information.
 I&#x27;m also just looking for a brief rundown of how you would organise the notes in emacs on a very basic level

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am happy to announce a new release of these packages for FPGA/ASIC development. I believe there are great improvements and new features such as:
  
LSP autoconfiguration for &#x60;lsp-bridge&#x60; and &#x60;lspce&#x60; clients
 
Builtin xref backend for navigation of definitions/references 
 
Incremental tag collection and caching for autocompletion and navigation
 
Integration of tree-sitter on all existing features for improved performance
 
Better project management
 
All functionality tested on Emacs 29.1, 29.2 and 29.3
 
Updated GitHub Wiki pages for each feature
 
Fixed many bugs

                              <span>The immanent release of Ubuntu 24.04 is in a poor state at the moment, presumably because of the xz vulnerability, but emacs-gtk 29.3 became installable today for the first time.
 I&#x27;m so used to Debian &amp; Ubuntu shipping with an old emacs, this makes me very happy.

                              <span>New to emacs, not sure if this is a bug with the windows version or I&#x27;m missing something. Using version 29.3
 Very simple init.el:
 (add-to-list &#x27;load-path &quot;path/to/evil&quot;) (require &#x27;evil) (evil-mode 1) 
 But it still isn&#x27;t enabled on startup. I can enable it manually, but interestingly, I have to enter the command twice. If I remove (evil-mode 1), I just have to execute the command once. Other commands in my init.el get executed as expected.
 It works as expected when running emacs through WSL. I&#x27;ve also tried installing with package.el and elpaca but same thing. I was also able to install general.el without issue, and I&#x27;m a solid 4 hours in at this point, so I&#x27;m not sure where else to look. It just seems like (evil-mode 1) in my init.el doesn&#x27;t work for some reason
 Edit: Just added hooks to enable evil-mode to work around this

                              <span>Hello I&#x27;m a really new user to orgmode,literally just downloaded lol and don&#x27;t really have any experience with coding or programming. Is there a way to make setting up the app easier or any tips people could give me? 
 I was also wondering how the notes are organised, are they organised by different pages like something in obsidian or is it more of an atomic way like logseq? 
 Linked to the idea of organisation can I organise things via tags and links and stuff instead of folders because of ease of use and things like that because in obsidian my workflow was based around tags instead of looking through specific folders to find my information.
 I&#x27;m also just looking for a brief rundown of how you would organise the notes in orgmode on a very basic level.
 This is a copy paste from the emacs subreddit as I feel like it would better fit here.

So if I&#x27;m adding headings to various different org-mode files throughout my org directory, is there a way to &quot;tag and copy&quot; a certain heading and its content added to A.org over to Blog.org? Or have a reference/link in my Blog.org that knows to grab/tangle heading and its content from A.org into my blog?

                              <span>Bit of a specific issue: I&#x27;m using ox-hugo to export org-mode blogs to a hugo website. The website uses the Archie theme. The bibliography formatting turns out weird, specifically the numbering:
 Example of bibliography and badly formatted numbering
 What I would hope to get is something like:
 [1] Reference 1 [2] Reference 2 
 I have the following in the org file header:
 #+cite_export: basic numeric numeric #+bibliography: ~/OrgFiles/OrgRoam/biblio.bib 
 and use the following for a citation:
 [cite:@reference] 
 I export using &quot;Export to Hugo-compatible Markdown :: Subtree to Md file&quot;.
 A &quot;(1)&quot; appears in the text ok, although not hyperlinked to the actual reference in the bibliography section, but not as bothered about that.
 How do I fix the formatting of the bibliography numbering?

                              <span>I used to have a job where I had been hired as a Scala dev. Then I got roped into doing database stuff and haven&#x27;t touched any Scala code for real in years. Last time I did any production coding was before they announced that Akka was moving away from open source, and Zio was still pretty new. Consequently, I&#x27;ve also fallen off on staying up to date on the happenings in the Scala community.
 So what&#x27;s the new hotness I should be on top of if I&#x27;m going to advertise myself as a Scala dev again? Any big new developments I&#x27;ve missed? What should I study up on to ensure I speak the correct language at an interview?

                              <span>I mostly use Scala with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), currently at v2. Few years back, I wrote an utility for backing up and moving my WSL distro between computers. I recently cleaned it up - check out if this can be of any use! The code used Li&#x27;s excellent ammonite CLI and a Scala script, nothing too fancy!

 I&#x27;m using the type safe example here: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-functions-udf-aggregate.html
 Anyone encountered this before/is this a known issue?

                              <span>Hey! Could you please help me pick a topic for undergrad research related to Haskell?
 I have zero experience with research and little experience with Haskell, but I loved what I&#x27;ve seen of the language so far, and was told that undergrad research would be a great way to learn about it. Do you have any suggestions for topics that are reasonable to research in one year? (Don&#x27;t know how it works elsewhere, but where I study, that&#x27;s how long an undergrad research project typically lasts)
 I was thinking of doing research related to DataSci (I&#x27;m open to suggestions in other fields), maybe implementing some aspects of the Pandas library in Haskell. Is this a decent idea? Do you know of any features that would be interesting?
 Also, I have a (demanding) full time job as a software developer, so ideally the project shouldn&#x27;t be super difficult.
 Any help will be so very much appreciated. Thanks!

 On Win11 I use the light theme but I prefer to have my Emacs use a dark theme which results in an Emacs frame with a dark buffer and a light themed title and scroll bar.
 Is there a way to force Emacs to use the dark system theme for it&#x27;s title and scroll bar?

                              <span>There is a zsh plugin called &quot;powerlevel10k&quot; that has a feature called &quot;transient prompts&quot; that when enabled replaces the previous prompt with a simpler one to allow more screen real estate. 
 I currently use both eshell and zsh inside the eat Emacs terminal emulator and have my zsh configured so my prompt displays my current directory but only for the current prompt and not previous ones.
 is there a way to configure eshell or eat to make eshell behave like zsh does with transient prompts? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>After a lot of tweaking I am finally using as a emacs daemon on my mac. I have one outstanding issue. When I launch multiple frames, they are all represented under one dock and cmd-tab entry. So when I cmd-tab I’d like to have a separate entry for each frame (as though they were all distinct processes. 
 Anyone know if this is possible?

 Generate Commit Messages within magit-status Buffer
 Yep, you guessed it, another one calling the GPT API(gptel). The prompt modified from gptcommit, I&#x27;ve simplified it, trimming down API calls at the cost of accuracy. This package is more for fun than productive. There was a similar package before: Introducing GPT-Commit: An Emacs Package for AI-Generated Commit Messages, but the community feedback wasn&#x27;t very positive. Hence, I&#x27;ve been a bit hesitant to put it out there until recently when I finally uploaded it to MELPA. Anyway, I&#x27;ll still share it and any feedback are welcome.

                              <span>Anyone would know what is the best way to use devil mode while in evil insert mode?
 I like to slowly go back to the emacs keybinding and get reacquainted to it since i find devil-mode fascinating, 
 What strategy would you suggest to make devil-mode automatically enabled when using evil-mode?
 I already have :
 (setq evil-disable-insert-state-bindings t)
 what else would i need to start automatically devil-mode while in insert mode
 thanks for reading

                              <span>I recently migrated from VSCode to Doom Emacs, loving it so far. Though the learning curve seems steep, and I have lots of questions. Since I work with C/C++ most of the time, spent the Saturday goofind with Emacs GDB &amp; make. And I encountered the problem with M-x +evil:make (pic 1). It seems like the function&#x27;s supposed to create an interactive &quot;sh&quot; so that I can input the argument (pic 2), but it doesn&#x27;t (pic 4). Also attached an image showing edebug (pic 3) but I barely understand this tool.

 My questions:
 - Have anyone encountered my problem? Tried a couple other +evil: functions, they don&#x27;t create any interactive environment either
 - What is the &quot;proper&quot; way to close the comint terminal? C-x k seems tedious, if I can navigate and &quot;q&quot; it somehow would be nice. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 Do any of you have a working config for dape which attaches to a remote dlv-dap adapter. In my case, goland binary runs in a pod. I have a ssh tunnel to it. And I attach to localhost on the ssh tunnel port. I do see in the cmdline &quot;Handling connection for&quot; print by the ssh tunnel. But dape doest connect to dlv on the binary. Goland easily does this though.
 If you have a working config for remote attach to dlv-dap, please do share.

                              <span>I made a post yesterday about Scala.js.
 I spent two days to experiment with Scala.js and the three.js library for developing small 3D Games.
 I have used ScalablyTyped for generating the facades.
 I&#x27;m confident to say I&#x27;m a total beginner in three.js and scala.js. 
 I came to the conclusion that Scala.js can be awesome but I feel it is too much troubles since the facades generated by ScalablyTyped have some kind of issues and making the facades by myself for a 3D library isn&#x27;t a trivial task.
 At least it isn&#x27;t for me :)
 Not knowing well three.js sure isn&#x27;t helping.
 I probably gonna stick to TypeScript for this use case.
 If I really wanna use Scala, better use a framework like Libgdx (Java) anyway.
 I do feel like Scala.js is really good but it makes more sense when working with scala.js libraries like Laminar.
 Using it to use a heavy javascript library perhaps make less sense. Especially for a simple video game. 
 Anybody have used three.js with Scala.js?
 Any thoughts overall?

                              <span>I seem to recall a few years ago reading that there was a connection, and iirc the connection went something like:
  
Functors can represent up to Finite State Machines
 Applicatives can represent up to, I dunno, Push Down Automatas somehow?
 Monads can represent up to Turing Machines
 Selectives are somewhere in between Applicative and Monad. 
  
I mean, definitely in between Applicative and Monad in computation ability, but also nested on the Chomsky Hierarchy somewhere. Are they akin to Push Down Automatas?
 Am I just hallucinating the connection? (Also, if you have a favorite Selective resource, please send it my way! :) )

                              <span>How do production Haskell folks approach i18n and l10n in their projects? Mainstream tech stacks have generous support from services like Transifex and Lokalise, JS folks benefit from native support of Project Fluent, and what about Haskell? Do you simply use gettext? Are there gettext extractors for _() literal patterns from source files? What extra tooling are you excited to use for the problem of i18n and l10n?

                              <span>I am reading Thinking with Types: Type-Level Programming in Haskell book currently. In Chapter 2, Section 2.2 Data Kinds, I am finding the highlighted part, in the screenshot attached below, very confusing; it says &quot;we can change our User type...&quot; what does this mean?
 https://preview.redd.it/lemuzpikwtsc1.png?width&#x3D;774&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;f4cf318243853d7217c99f49856a86313b259ae9
 I tried this out in ghci (please refer to the screenshot attached below). But as expected, this causes an error. User is already defined as a data constructor for the UserType type, so creating another type by the same name gives an error. So, what does that line exactly mean? That
  
we can change our User type...
  
Kindly help me understand this. I am still new to this, so it is possible that I am unable to put together some related concepts that I have covered but might not have understood as well as I think I have. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>In order to get control of boxes around code in PDF exports, I&#x27;ve been placing code blocks in mdframed pairs, like this:
 #+begin_mdframed #+begin_src emacs-lisp ;; lisp goes in here #+end_src #+end_mdframed 
 However, I&#x27;ve noticed that it stops the code being treated as code from the point of view of formatting in emacs -- coloring, indentation, and so on.
 Is there a way around that?

 I am trying to set up functions to differentiate the visual styles of programming modes, text modes (specifically org mode, but also others), and the dashboard. The hooks, however, seem to only trigger when I manually set the mode of the buffer (e.g. when I run M-x emacs-lisp-mode in init.el), and not automatically when I open a file with a given major mode. Is there a better way to write these hooks? As well, the line numbers don&#x27;t always seem to disappear properly in text modes, am I incorrectly using (display-line-numbers-mode -1)?

                              <span>This function is called when you have pixel-scroll-precision-mode activated with the pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate-mice option enabled and scroll with the mouse wheel. The problem I&#x27;m having is that a single slight movement of the mouse wheel results in a substantial amount of scrolling.
 It is adequate if the windows takes the whole screen, but if you have some tinier ones, it&#x27;s too much, and you&#x27;re missing content. Is there a way to make it take into account the window size? (I&#x27;m talking about emacs&#x27;s windows here).
 For instance, I did something similar for the M-v and C-v keybinds, since I felt like scrolling the entire window was too much, so I just wanted half the window:
 (defun pixel-scroll-interpolate-half-down () (interactive) (pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate (/ (- (window-text-height nil t)) 2) nil 1)) (defun pixel-scroll-interpolate-half-up () (interactive) (pixel-scroll-precision-interpolate (/ (window-text-height nil t) 2) nil 1)) 
 Making the scroll wheel go past, I don&#x27;t know, maybe a fifth of the window would be cool.

                              <span>Hello, i&#x27;m new to Emacs and I set it up on my arch system as a systemd unit and I try to open a client with 
 emacsclient -c 
 (which I thought should open in a gui client window) but it does the exact same thing as
 emacsclient -t 
 (opens in current terminal in urxvt) 
 all things considered its fine and it works pretty well in a terminal but I don&#x27;t understand what is going on - it was working previously but I&#x27;m not finding any error messages or anything of the sort anywhere 
 Running I3 if that matters .. Thanks !

I have spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out how to set up eglot, corfu, cape etc. on my python project but the results are &quot;meh&quot;. I get generic suggestions, it is not really able to pick up internals of classes (suggest methods etc. after I type object_name dot...) or even other imported modules and in general it is nowhere nearly as usable as VS code (which I am not a fan of). So, either my expectations are too high or I am doing something wrong!
 Can anyone post or point me to the simplest code completion initl.el setup in Emacs that I can use? I don&#x27;t have the time to spend weeks trying to debug this stuff, unfortunately. Sometimes and just sometimes, I would like things to work out of the box without having to become an expert in every package that is out there. Apologies if this sounds like I am lazy, I am not but deadlines, work, life... 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to set up emacs for editing astrojs.
 To prevent my config getting too complicated, I&#x27;m trying to set up seperate configs. I want to use chemacs2 to switch between profiles.
 https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2
 My .emacs-profiles.el looks like this:
 ((&quot;default&quot; . ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/.emacs.d-default&quot;)))
 (&quot;astro&quot; ((user-emacs-directory . &quot;~/.emacs.d-astro&quot;)))
 )
 If I just start emacs by typing in &#x27;emacs&#x27; at terminal, my default profile loads. As I believe it should.
 I think I should be able to load my astro profile by typing &#x27;emacs --with-profile astro&#x27;.
 However, this loads emacs with no init. The init in my astro profile does not load.
 How can I get the astro profile to load?

                              <span>I am experiencing a total slowdown in a fresh emacs instance, started with &#x60;-Q&#x60; (which as I understand starts without &#x60;.emacs&#x60; init so as to produce an unbiased measurement). The file is around 1800 lines of a list of non-enclosed braced sublist in a C header file, i.e. a syntactically incorrect file of:
 ​
 { one, two, three, four },
 { five, six, seven, eight },
 ...1800 more lines...
 As soon as I put the braces around the whole list, i.e. one opening &#x60;{&#x60; in line 1 and one closing &#x60;}&#x60; in line 1800, the slowdown is reduced (but still a bit noticeable). The performance monitor (mem) shows that it is indeed the handling of a braced list:
 877,399,714 70% - redisplay_internal (C function)
 877,226,114 70% - jit-lock-function
 877,226,114 70% - jit-lock-fontify-now
 877,221,930 70% - jit-lock--run-functions
 877,221,930 70% - #
 877,221,930 70% - font-lock-fontify-region
 877,221,930 70% - c-font-lock-fontify-region
 876,951,138 70% - font-lock-default-fontify-region
 876,876,741 70% - font-lock-fontify-keywords-region
 876,465,670 70% - c-font-lock-declarations
 875,641,854 70% - c-find-decl-spots
 873,729,173 70% - #
 861,984,604 69% - c-get-fontification-context
 859,903,452 69% - c-inside-bracelist-p
 858,589,113 69% + c-looking-at-or-maybe-in-bracelist
 1,165,232 0% + c-backward-over-enum-header
 365,361,651 29% + command-execute
 287,920 0% + timer-event-handler
 56 0% mouse--click-1-maybe-follows-link
 48 0% + tooltip-show-help
 0 0% ...
 Are we stuck with this kind of performance degradation in braced or somehow else bracketed lists? 1800 lines is not small but it also isn&#x27;t really big.
 I know that the syntax is illegal but honestly I don&#x27;t think that the editor should make this a problem for the user.

 Again, basic information for newbies like me.
 As with the previous post, I have tried getting my hands dirty with a bit of Lisp, in the attempt to feel the vertigo of dipping into the depths of Emacs&#x27; internals. I enjoyed studying these topics a lot and felt that sharing was due.

                              <span>For example if I&#x27;m using typescript and I have the following data:
 const orbitRatios &#x3D; { mercury: 0.2408467, venus: 0.61519726, ... neptune: 164.79132, }; 
 I can easily create a type that contains all the keys of orbitRatios
 type Planet &#x3D; keyof typeof orbitRatios; 
 instead of manually doing something like
 type Planet &#x3D; &quot;mercury&quot; | &quot;earth&quot; | ... 
 and if orbitRatios get updated or extended I don&#x27;t have to manually update the type.
 I wonder What is the mentality to approach the same problem using haskell.
 What I did is
 orbitRatios :: [(String, Double)] orbitRatios &#x3D; [ (&quot;mercury&quot;, 0.2408467), (&quot;venus&quot;, 0.61519726), ... (&quot;neptune&quot;, 164.79132) ] test :: String -&gt; Double -&gt; Double test planetName elapsedTime &#x3D; case mRatio of Nothing -&gt; do something otherwise -&gt; do something where mRatio &#x3D; lookup planetName orbitRatios 
 the function accepts wherever string and I have to check against a list of tuples if the given key does exist.
 is this the appropriate way?

                              <span>Why can&#x27;t just make GHC implicitly replace data with newtype implementation (where applicable) and only use data keyword?
 The linter always keep suggesting me to use newtype for every convertible data in my code.

 Out of curiousity, do you use ScalablyTyped or similar plugins to get your facades or you write your own?
 I wanted to experiment with the three.js library with Scala.js.
 I was not sure if I should use ScalablyTyped.
 Any thoughts?
 Note: Given that I&#x27;m trying to develop a little game with three.js with ton of mutations, perhaps Scala.js doesn&#x27;t make sense lol

 What are your thoughts about Scala.js in 2024?
 Aside from our love for Scala, does it make sense over TypeScript? 
 I&#x27;d love to read any practical examples.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey, fairly new to programming and in my first semester.
 We use Scala and the university recommended using Linux Fedora as our OS. I always had some troubles with Scala but now we approach the exam and now my Scala doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 First I had a problem with Java Home, which seems to be fixed, but now the next one is even more significant.
 I cant even run the scalac command in cmd and anytime a function is mentioned in code when I paste it, it spews out the same old Error 6.
 Yes, I have tried running code I know works and the error persists.
 ​
 At this point I&#x27;m just clueless and if I can&#x27;t fix this i will just return to Windows

                              <span>I have been annoyed with having three different sets of copy/paste shortcuts: ctrl-c/ctrl-v for most apps including browsers, shift-ctrl-c/shift-ctrl-v for the terminal, and y and p in emacs evil mode.
 But (at least on linux) shift-insert and ctrl-insert work as copy/paste everywhere, including the terminal and emacs!
 Of course, the insert key is not near the home row on most keyboards, but I set up my qmk firmware to move it close. Your operating system probably has some way to remap something handy like super-c/super-v to shift-insert/ctrl-insert.

                              <span>Friends, this has been haunting me for months...
 When navigating through GNU license, I notice that they share the license file in many format, yet not org-mode. src: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL
 On Emacs source repo, all text files aren&#x27;t in &#x60;.org&#x60; (like README, CHANGELOG, NEWS, etc.)
 Also when looking at documentation site, there is always either a pdf or html version, but not org-mode. (this one, I can find some logic of why not at least)
 Is there any reason for this?

                              <span>My emacs initialization on my Debian 12 computer is kept in my home directory in .emacs.d/ Inside I have an init.el with this at the bottom
 (when (file-readable-p &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;) (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name &quot;~/.emacs.d/config.org&quot;))) (setq my-custom-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/my-custom.el&quot;) (load my-custom-file) 
 which calls and sets up everything in the config.org, then loads the my-custom.el file. The my-custom.el has my very large custom-set-variables list. This works -- sort of. My problem is whenever I use the interactive Emacs customize system it updates any committed customization of variables in a new custom-set-variables list which it tacks onto the end of my init.el file. IOW, it doesn&#x27;t know I want it stored in my-custom.el And so now I have a new version and an out-of-date version of custom-set-variables in my-custom.el. Also the custom-set-faces list gets tacked onto the end of init.el whenever I change that. Is there any way to have Emacs understand that I want at least custom-set-variables accessed, changed only from the my-custom.el?

                              <span>i have been working on this package https://github.com/mahmoodsheikh36/blk
 it started as a small collection of utilities and then i decided to package it, it helps the user create links between different blocks of text in (possibly) different files, similar to org-roam but not restricted to org headings/files, the patterns that can be linked to are defined using regex, and grep (or another tool, e.g. ripgrep or emacs itself) can be used behind the scenes to find the links when blk-open-at-point is invoked, this is the baseline functionality but much more is possible, including navigating to functions in source code by their names (e.g. your init.el) and inserting links from your elisp files to your org files and vice versa (inserting a link to an elisp function in an org file, without having to worry about the filenames, only about the function&#x27;s name as that is how its found when using blk-open-at-point).
 i would be happy to answer any questions, please note that this is still very much a work in progress but i feel it is perhaps time i received some feedback. so any criticism/suggestions are welcome. thank you!

 The package is in its infantry but it is doing its job well. I would really appreciate to receive feedback from some users to help it mature. Please, feel welcome to open issues with bugs, ideas, features requests or simply comments and opinions.

                              <span>There are some of macOS-specified shortcuts like &#x60;S-c&#x60; (yank) &#x60;S-s&#x60; (save-buffer) ... on &#x60;--with-ns&#x60; compilation on emacs.
 However I think some of these shortcuts are not just appending the existing keybindes on emacs (which is expected), but making the existing keybinds unusable.
 For example, I cannot press &#x60;C-x-C-s&#x60; or &#x60;C-s&#x60; on &#x60;--with-ns&#x60; version on emacs. It is wierd that these keybinds cannot be scannable for emacs. When I press it, emacs simply do not responding. The minibuffer waits for next input like &#x60;C-x-C-&#x60; even if I pressed multiple times &#x60;s&#x60;, and when i pressing other key on keyboard, It responds and that other binding is executed. I&#x27;m able to use &#x60;S-s&#x60; for saving and &#x60;S-f&#x60; for I-search instead, but these keybindings are not comfortable for my hands, so I really want to use the original one.
 Is there anyone experiencing same thing on macOS? Or if anyone has ideas on how to fix it, I&#x27;d really appreciate it.

                              <span>TL;DR
 When I follow an attachment: type link, how does Org mode know where the target is?
 Details
 I&#x27;m (re-)getting to grips with attachments and remembered something that puzzled me the first time but I never resolved. Suppose I have the following:
 (setq org-attach-preferred-new-method &#x27;id) (setq org-attach-method &#x27;cp) (set org-id-method &#x27;ts) (setq org-attach-store-link-p &#x27;attached) 
 and I then create a brand new heading and attach a file -- call it myfile.org -- to it.
 I will end up with the following:
  
the heading having had a property drawer created and an ID property inserted, with a value of something like 20240403T211636.762842
 a copy of myfile.org placed in /20/240403T211636.762842/, and
 a link added to org-stored-links as (&quot;attachment:myfile.org&quot; &quot;myfile.org&quot;)
  
Then, if Igo somewhere else entirely -- another file in my vast Org estate, say -- and use C-c C-l to run org-insert-link and choose that new link, I&#x27;ll end up with this inserted:
 [[attachment:myfile.org][myfile.org]] 
 (which may well be rendered to look like myfile.org, but it&#x27;s the above text underneath nevertheless.)
 Finally, if I follow that link, e.g. using C-c C-o to org-open-at-point -- I&#x27;m taken to the attached file, /20/240403T211636.762842/myfile.org
 How does Org know where that file is?

                              <span>I wrote this to generate a daily activity report from your org-roam zettelkasten.
 https://codeberg.org/Hermanhel/org-roam-activity-report
 I wrote it because I was impressed by archive&#x27;s statistic report I saw sometime ago in their &quot;what&#x27;s going on in your zettelkasten&quot; thread (0402&#x27;s post) that looks like this:
 https://forum.zettelkasten.de/uploads/editor/6i/6ycjhibhredi.png
 And want something like this for org-roam
 I plan on adding more statistics attributes in the future.
 enjoy.

However, I cannot construct a feedback mechanism that will help me to correct things other than sending my zettels to another person.
Any thoughts on how to improve thinking skills or build a feedback loop by myself?</span>

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I wonder if anyone here uses beorg on iOS for their org agenda?
 I subscribe to the &quot;many tiny org files&quot; method, and it works totally fine on the desktop (especially with org-roam).
 With beorg, I have significant sync slow downs. To the tune of 10 seconds. That makes it practically unusable. 
 I experimented with only including org files that have * TODOs in the them and that made a huge difference -- from ~10 seconds to sub second. It makes sense since I have a few thousand org files, but only a handful of them have TODOs.
 In any case, does anyone have any advice on how to expose only a subset of org files to beorg while maintaining a master copy on my desktop?

                              <span>Hi,
 how do I manually add some extra information to a state-change logbook entry without breaking anything?
 The logbook that is automatically created looks like this:
 :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;DONE&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2024-04-04 Thu 03:50] :END: 
 Could I do simply do this:
 :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;DONE&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2024-04-04 Thu 03:50] and I also wanted to record this :END: Or would I need to do this: :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;DONE&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2024-04-04 Thu 03:50] - and I also wanted to record this :END: 
 or is it a matter of taste?

                              <span>I use org-mode for journaling with org-roam-dailies, and I also use org-agenda for daily schedules. Most of the times I&#x27;d open the agenda buffer alongside the org daily buffer so I can document accordingly to what&#x27;s shown in the agenda for today. I also use org-clock, so if I were to find the timeline of a certain task after seeing it in my dailies, I&#x27;d search for the corresponding day in the agenda (with M-x calendar) then check of the clock logs. 
 I wonder if there&#x27;s a better way to link org-agenda directly with dailies. I thought of going with simple org-agenda-add-note but this loses the functionality of org-roam linking + Encryption becomes harder

 Same as above.. I found hsautogui.. but could not install it.. Not sure if its being maintained.
 Are there any areas of data science / GUI automation where haskell is used ?

Alias the current module with Imp by Taylor Fausak
Sometimes when writing a Haskell module you want to use an identifier that would be ambiguous. For example perhaps you’re writing a logger and want to call a function log. That’s a problem because the Prelude also defines a function called log. You can’t use either one without disambiguating. Usually you will disambiguate by qualifying the identifier like MyLogger.log. This is fine but it is a little annoying because it duplicates the name of the module. If you later refactor this module by changing its name, you’ll also have to update a…</span>

 I&#x27;m a beginner to emacs (coming from a vim background) and am trying to remap my capslock to act as escape on tapping and ctrl when holding. Currently using kmonad to do it but was wondering about other programs people in the community use.
 Thanks!

                              <span>For example, the Which-key information for the C-x prefix doesn&#x27;t show the full list of commands after C-x i, and paging via C-h n just jumps to C-x p rather than showing the info related to C-x j, C-x k etc. I&#x27;ve tried to set the which-key-key-face and some other options, but I can&#x27;t seem to fix this.

                              <span>I am convinced there is some minor toggle switch somewhere that will make it all suddenly work, but right now, it is identical to exporting to HTML. It does not make a reveal.js presentation for me. The only thing I can find is people saying they don&#x27;t know how to use it lol
 How do you actually use it?

                              <span>Im writing some elisp code that runs cl methods on trees when the user types something. Sometimes, the user types a command that exists but the tree it is acting on has the wrong shape. In this case, I want to override cl-no-applicable-method so that the code automatically inserts a template definition for the command in the correct file. If the command definitions were functions, this would be easy using find-function, but because they are methods, find-function cannot find the files where they are defined. Is there a way to solve this?

But I want only indent guide for python-mode and disable for all other language by default. Probably that easy but I am beginner in emacs.

                              <span>Hello, I got notice that the new parser made by u/geza42 has finally landed into emacs master (thank you u/geza42 for your contribution &lt;3) that makes lsp faster, sadly i can&#x27;t do a good benchmark due my pc is too slow to see any difference, but for user like lsp-bridge, lsp-mode and eglot (with or without emacs-lsp-booster)...
 Can you see a notable difference? 
 What are your experiences with the new parser? 
 this question can be a bit early due parser has merged like \2 days ago) but I would like to hear your opinions.

Whereas when i start emacs on my PC running gentoo(4 cores 16GB ram emacs compiled with athena widgets set and nativecomp) it starts in 2 seconds. Does anyone know why this happens? This is with the same configuration (https://github.com/oblivikun/emacs) im very confused

                              <span>I’d like describe-function to be able to show help for C/C++/CMake functions similar to how it works for elisp. I’d read on the internet that this was possible, but I can’t find the links anymore. One post talked about linking to cppreference.com or cplusplus.com. I don’t remember if this was happening through eldoc or lsp. At any rate, curious how one might set this up.

                              <span>Hello!
I have started using The Archive about a couple of days ago in order to centralise my note taking - as I discovered that I&#x27;ve been jumping between the Simplenote and Apple Notes for a while now. Was using NValt some time ago, but it&#x27;s become grossly outdated and unstable.
I love the idea behind The Archive and its implementation is both visually and conceptually appealing. However, I&#x27;ve discovered a couple of issues with it:
The most annoying one is when I get past one page of writing text in a note - in a particularly long paragraph, the frame starts jolting every time I press &quot;Space&quot; - scrolling quickly down and up, until I start a new paragraph, and then this behaviour disappears. It might be that this problem has already been reported, but I could not find it in the forum - perhaps I was using wrong keywords.
Another issue is with the displaying of the Cyrillic letter &quot;и&quot; (which roughly corresponds to the Latin &quot;i&quot; as in the word &quot;Tim&quot;) - for some reason, occasionally it starts to be displayed with a different background to the rest of the text - as if there was a rectangle behind it. I didn&#x27;t have enough play with different fonts and themes (using PrettyFunctional with Dark mode and the UbuntuMono-Regular 20.0 pt. at the moment)
I hope someone can advise me on how to overcome the above issues, thank you!</span>

                              <span>Luhmann often described his Zettelkasten as a communicative partner. It seems that it was more than just a metaphor for him. Of course, the slip box does not have an independent consciousness, a life of its own. Sooner or later, however, the phenomenon of animation arises.
I have a question for the community participants. Has anyone ever felt like the slip box becomes a thinking being? How would you describe the feeling?</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 sometimes I have a piece of data that appears in different contexts, an example would be the amount of a payment that would be both part of a speadsheed calculation as well as part of a todo-item.
 Is there any way to enter this data only on one location and somehow refer to it from other locations to ensure that everything is consistent?
 I am aware that you can refer from a table cell to a cell in another table - is there something similar for headlines?

                              <span>In Brick.Forms , the way to create a new form is that you have a Haskell data type with some pre defined fields which then become the corresponding input in the brick form.
  
This module provides an input form API. This API allows you to construct an input interface based on a data type of your choice. Each input in the form corresponds to a field in your data type. This API then automatically dispatches keyboard and mouse input events to each form input field, manages rendering of the form, notifies the user when a form field&#x27;s value is invalid, and stores valid inputs in your data type when possible 
  
I have a requirement where, I have, say a list of column names from a db table, and I want to make a brick form to insert a new row in the db table.
 Since I could select any db table at run time, the column names can change at run time.
 So at best the data type I can have is a thin wrapper around the list of column names. 
 How can I make brick form with such a data type?
 For simplicity lets assume, the form ,for all the input fields rendered, accepts only string values or Text values. 
 If I cannot make a form with such a data type, what are the alternatives?

                              <span>I wanted to add Lift instances to djot as per this PR but this fails on GHC &lt;&#x3D;9.2 because the base datatypes like Seq don&#x27;t have Lift instances.
 As jgm pointed out, conditionally deriving the instances would violate a library policy (although maybe it&#x27;s ok to have features enabled for later language versions idk).
 Is there a better way of doing this?

                              <span>I am working on a JSON formatting library. Suppose the following structure:
 Text.JSON.Format ├── Text.JSON.Format.Object └── Text.JSON.Format.Array 
 Where the outermost Text.JSON.Format exports ppValue to prettyprint a JSON Value which in turn uses ppObject and ppArray from respective internal modules.
 The problem is, when prettyprinting an object or an array, you would need to refer to ppValue to prettyprint the values inside the object or array, which cannot be done without creating a cyclic dependency.
 If that&#x27;s unclear, here&#x27;s the simplified project:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell module Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) where
 import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Prettyprinter
 import Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) import Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray)
 ppValue :: Int -&gt; Aeson.Value -&gt; Doc ann ppValue nesting &#x3D; \case Aeson.Object obj -&gt; ppObject nesting obj Aeson.Array arr -&gt; ppArray nesting arr other -&gt; ppByteStringLazy $ Aeson.encode other &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Object (ppObject) where
 import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!
 ppObject :: Int -&gt; Aeson.Object -&gt; Doc ann ppObject nesting obj &#x3D; ... -- uses ppValue &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell module Text.JSON.Format.Array (ppArray) where
 import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson import Text.JSON.Format (ppValue) -- error!
 ppArray :: Int -&gt; Aeson.Array -&gt; Doc ann ppArray nesting arr &#x3D; ... -- uses ppValue &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 There would be no problem when ppObject and ppArray are defined in the same module as ppValue, had their implementations not been too bulky and complex; sadly they are, thus it would be better to separate them. But how could this be done without creating a cyclic dependency?
 Here&#x27;s the repo for anyone interested in the full code.

                              <span>Dear fellow Scala devs,
 I&#x27;d like to share with you a small pet project I started months ago as an excuse to learn about Scala 3 macros, and then evolved into a Scala 3 compiler plugin :))
 Sometimes, for convenience, it&#x27;s easy to dump a whole case class into console/log, because of the way Scala neatly formats all its content; however, if that class contains sensitive data like api keys / PIIs / other sensitive data, you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to leak these fields by mistake.
 Therefore, enter redacted:
  
include redacted compiler plugin
 import redacted annotation
 mark sensitive fields with @redacted
  
and you&#x27;re good to go!
 Hope you&#x27;ll like it and find it useful :)

                              <span>Visible changes in addition to the usual bug fixes:
 Compiler-plugin:
  
first release with automatic generation for &#x27;shifted variants&#x27; of high-order functions. It is possible when the ho function does not store functional arguments in variables but only invokes (as in map). This is the work of Olena Kravchenko during her GSoC-2023 project. More details can be found in Olena-s presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H5rIQlqeektpZAnC547YnlPoXChrH99UOLMy4kY-pRQ/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing and GitHub discussion: https://github.com/rssh/dotty-cps-async/discussions/79.
 Added compile-time checks for attempts to use direct syntax when the compiler plugin is not enabled. It is possible to freely mix code compiled with and without a plugin, if you accidentally forget the plugin when it was needed, you will receive a compile-time error.
  
Logic module:
  
Extend API, add a few examples in tests, and an implementation of CpsLogicMonad over LazyList.

 has anyone completed the course on the coursera platform: Functional Programming in Scala Specialization (from EPFL)? Could you tell me if the course is specific enough and focuses not only on the basics but also on more complex concepts? If you completed the entire course, did it also give you something to practice, were you able to program independently and solve more complex problems after the course? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>For those using hiedb either for tooling purposes or code analysis I wrote a simple ghc plugin which automatically re-indexes modules on recompile.
 It can be pretty useful for large projects using tools like static-ls or https://github.com/agentultra/hiedb-mode.

                              <span>Several of my codebases working with Event Sourcing contain a recurring pattern: read raw events from a source (usually EventStoreDB), decode them and fold them to get the latest state of an entity.
 I can write a single interpreter function, but I need to call it for each event type, which could add quite a number of interpreters of the stack, and I&#x27;m wondering if I could write it in a way that I can just add one interpreter and be done with it.
 Here&#x27;s the simplest code to demonstrate the issue:
 https://gist.github.com/kephas/90a0cd7fb719bfdf6077c4b57efd5758
 As you can see, I need to do run $ runFakeEventStore @Int $ runFakeEventStore @Char $ program. The question is, is there a way to write runFakeEvenstore so that I can just do run $ runFakeEventStore program?

                              <span>EDIT: I fixed it. Open straight build and repo folders, delete auctex, reopen emacs, and the problem disappears
 I&#x27;ve used AUCTeX for ages but I seem to have recurring issues with it loading. I recently started up Emacs (29.1, Emacs for MacOS) and got an error that &quot;auctex.elc failed to provide feature &#x27;auctex&#x27;&quot;. I tried deleting the build folder and having it recompile, I tried upgrading to 29.3, but I can&#x27;t get AUCTeX to load. My googling has failed to surface anything relevant. Any ideas that people have would be greatly appreciated.
 I use straight.el with use-package for package management and initialization.
 The relevant portion of my config is:
 (use-package auctex :config (require &#x27;tex) (load &quot;preview-latex.el&quot; nil t t) (add-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook (flyspell-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook (auto-fill-mode -1)) (add-hook &#x27;LaTeX-mode-hook (visual-line-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;TeX-mode-hook (flyspell-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;TeX-mode-hook (auto-fill-mode -1)) (add-hook &#x27;TeX-mode-hook (visual-line-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;latex-mode-hook (flyspell-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;latex-mode-hook (auto-fill-mode -1)) (add-hook &#x27;latex-mode-hook (visual-line-mode 1)) (add-hook &#x27;markdown-mode-hook(auto-fill-mode -1)) ) 
 which throws the following error
 Error (use-package): auctex/:catch: Loading file /Users/me/.emacs.d/package-repos/straight/build/auctex/auctex.elc failed to provide feature ‘auctex’ 
 I also tried changing my config to the following as described in the auctex manual
 (use-package tex :ensure auctex ) 
 but it give me this error if I try to run it
 Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error &quot;Could not find package tex. Updating recipe reposi...&quot;) 
 Possibly related to my upgrade, I&#x27;m also getting this new error
 crux/:catch: Symbol’s chain of function indirections contains a loop: ConTeXt-mode

                              <span>Hi,
 I am using evil-mode and define keybindings using general.el.
 What I would like to do is to select files from the recentf-dialog (the one you get when calling recentf-open-files) with the space-key instead of the return-key.
 Could someone please give me a tip on how to achieve this?

 Vim was my first editor, so when switching to emacs I brought the bindings with me. Now after a couple of years of using emacs I am beginning to wonder if I am missing something by using evil and would appreciate to hear about your experience if you ever did the switch to default bindings.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use Emacs and one vim feature I miss so much is digraphs, i.e. inserting some additional (Unicode) symbols with two keypresses that describe it.
 Say, if I need to insert ä in vim, I press Ctrl-K a :, and that&#x27;s it.
 In Emacs I have Ctrl-x 8 RET, but that is extremely inconvenient, because I have to remember how symbol is called in Unicode table or look it up from recent symbols. If you need to paste some words in German or Greek, it&#x27;s really cumbersome.
 Is there a package that replicates vim behaviour?
 SOLVED: Ctrl-x 8 &quot; a gives me ä. For other symbols check help via Ctrl-x 8 Ctrl-h. Big thanks to u/lostcoffee.

                              <span>Based on valuable feedback and the challenges many of us face during online coding interviews or sessions, I&#x27;ve pushed a significant update to the Chrome-Emacs extension that extends its compatibility to more environments.
 This includes experimental support for vscode.dev, codesandbox.com, GitHub Codespaces, and other online Monaco-based editors where direct API access is unavailable.
 The update relies on simulating user interactions to achieve real-time synchronization from Emacs to the browser. Given the complexity of these platforms, the feature primarily supports synchronization from Emacs to the browser, with additional nuances due to the simulation approach.
 Important to Note:
 This experimental feature heavily relies on the presence of some default keyboard shortcuts within these web editors. These shortcuts are essential for simulating actions such as selection, deletion, and text navigation.
 For a detailed explanation and the full list of these shortcuts, please refer to our documentation on experimental Monaco support.
 I also primarily tested it on Linux. Although I have translated shortcuts to be Mac-compatible too, I haven&#x27;t tested it extensively.
 Try It Out: If you’re interested in testing this feature or want to see how Chrome-Emacs can enhance your coding sessions, visit the Chrome Web Store. Source code and installation instructions are available in this repository.

                              <span>I am trying to publish a HTML webpage using an Org file. I am using a very standard Lisp script that I execute in the terminal as: emacs -Q --script script.el following some of the work of System Crafters and some references on oc.el and CSL. 
 (require &#x27;ox-publish) (setq org-publish-project-alist &#x27;( (&quot;org-notes&quot; :base-directory &quot;./content&quot; :base-extension &quot;org&quot; :publishing-directory &quot;./public&quot; :recursive t :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html :headline-levels 4 :auto-preamble t ) (&quot;org-static&quot; :base-directory &quot;./content&quot; :base-extension &quot;css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf\\|txt\\|cur\\|svg\\|csv\\|json&quot; :publishing-directory &quot;./public&quot; :recursive t :publishing-function org-publish-attachment ) (&quot;org&quot; :components (&quot;org-notes&quot; &quot;org-static&quot;)))) (org-publish &quot;org&quot;) 
 I am using a csl file rather than the basic or bibtex options in my Org file:
 #+AUTHOR: Me #+BIBLIOGRAPHY: ~/bib/references.bib #+CITE_EXPORT: csl ~/Zotero/styles/apa.csl 
 When I export directly from Org-mode to a PDF or a HTML there is no error, but when I run my script.el, which is my preferred approach, I get the following error:
  eval-buffer(# nil &quot;/Users/topcat/projects/notes_org/build-site.el&quot; nil t) #f(compiled-function (buffer file) #)(# &quot;/Users/topcat/projects/notes_org/build-site.el&quot;) load-with-code-conversion(&quot;~/projects/notes_org/build-site.el&quot; &quot;/Users/topcat/projects/notes_org/build-site.el&quot; nil t #f(compiled-function (buffer file) #)) command-line--load-script(&quot;~/projects/notes_org/build-site.el&quot;) command-line-1((&quot;-scriptload&quot; &quot;./build-site.el&quot;)) command-line() normal-top-level() Citeproc library is not loaded 
 I am bit lost and haven&#x27;t found good documentation regarding references using oc.el in HTML project exports. Does anyone here has more experience with it?

Emins will run only on 8086 processors attached to VT52 terminals, eliminating all that overhead of window systems, multitasking OSes and all that #ifdefed C code. Lisp will be replaced with the direct control and numeric accuracy of the native instruction set. Key bindings will be limited to standard ones on C-a to C-z. Although this will make writing hard, it will save a lot of work and compositions that, let’s face it, are often written but not read. With all that extra time, we could finish the HURD, embed Scheme everywhere and write tools in simple languages to support all the complex languages people actually use.
 Come join us as we build Emins and keep a lid on the software complexity that only graybeards can handle.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I just fixed a long-time annoyance I had with evil-mode. I couldn&#x27;t find this info online so I thought I&#x27;d share it.
 Problem:
 In regular evil-mode, when you copy or format some text, evil will mess with your highlighted region (if you are in a visual mode) and your cursor. The cursor position will always be set to the original point or mark preferring the one which comes first. If you are in visual mode it will always unhighlight your region, which I also find annoying.
 Cursor Example
  
If you highlight from left to right and yank, your cursor will jump to where you started highlighting.
 If you highlight from right to left and yank, the cursor will stay where you stopped highlighting.
 If you highlight top to bottom and yank, your cursor will jump to where you started …</span>

                              <span>As a polyglot software engineer by day (and by night, and in the morning, too), I&#x27;m always keen to tweak editors I use via any scripting language available. (I&#x27;m that weird guy in the dark corner of the room who likes BOTH Emacs AND Vim precisely because they are so extensible.)
In fact, org-roam for Emacs is what turned me onto Zettelkasten, but I (so far) like the system you&#x27;ve evolved for managing the Zettels better, which is why I went ahead and purchased The Archive. My only complaint is that The Archive limited to Mac OS X, because I work on Windoze and Linux as well.
So, any info about what you&#x27;re planning that feature to entail would be of great interest to me.

This is yet another opportunity to share with your friends what you are working on. Add to this discussion by telling us about your zettelkasten journey. Share with us what you&#x27;re learning. Sharing helps me and, hopefully, you, too. It helps us clarify our goals and visualize our thinking. And sometimes, a conversation sparks a magical moment where we can dive into an idea worth exploring. We&#x27;d love to hear more from you.   🫵🏼
Ideas I&#x27;m exploring with my ZK:
I&#x27;m thinking a lot about metaphors and how they shape language. How they are used to communicate ideas. How they are used in ideation.
I&#x27;m reexamining how I can refactor my structure notes, transforming them into thinking tools. What does this mean, and how can I formalize this for myself?
I am integrating the project-driven areas of my life into my ZK. This week, my attention turned to melding my Samu Practice into my ZK, hoping for some serendipitical magic.

3 zettel - meta zettelkasting
★★★★★
The &quot;My rolling ten-day zettel production&quot; is produced by a script for attachment to my daily journaling template. I do my journaling in Bear to keep personal journaling separate from my knowledge work.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these notes.

                              <span>Hi, I would like to change the color of the modified buffer indicator in doom-modeline. I am not sure how to do it. I have tried (setq doom-modeline-buffer-modified (doom-color &#x27;red)), but it does not seem to work, neither does it give any error. Any help is appreciated. Thanks a lot.

                              <span>I have two machines: my laptop and a VPS. They do not share a filesystem. I regularly ssh into the server from the laptop and work on the commandline. I use a terminal emulator which runs in emacs on the laptop. Sometimes this involves opening files, often automatically, in $EDITOR (e.g. for a git commit). I want to configure $EDITOR so that the instance of emacs running the terminal emulator is also used as $EDITOR on the server, when I&#x27;m sshed into it. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to set it up so that if I ssh from a terminal which isn&#x27;t running in emacs, a different program (one local to the server, e.g. nano) will be used, but that&#x27;s a later question.
 How can I do this? I&#x27;ve read a cursory explanation here, but that seems to require a shared filesystem, and it&#x27;s pretty brief -- I&#x27;m new to any kind of networking. I do like the idea of using emacsserver to achieve all this though.
 TIA!

                              <span>Im migrating from Jetbrains Pycharm into Emacs and I was wondering if there is a way I can get autocompletions similar to Pycharm, this is:
 1 - Some way of &quot;auto importing&quot; modules (or at least some way of given a class/function get the option to import it)
 2 - LSP for internal stuffs, atm my lsp desnt seem to &quot;know&quot; about many homebrew classes&#x27; methods we have in our project.
 Here is the current LSP cfg i have on my emacs
 (use-package pyvenv
 :config
 (pyvenv-mode 1))
 (use-package python-mode
 :ensure t
 :hook (python-mode . lsp-deferred)
 :custom
 ;; NOTE: Set these if Python 3 is called &quot;python3&quot; on your system!
 (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;)
 (dap-python-executable &quot;python3&quot;)
 (dap-python-debugger &#x27;debugpy)
 :config
 (require &#x27;dap-python))
 ​
 ​
 (use-package company
 :after lsp-mode
 :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
 :bind (:map company-active-map
 (&quot;&quot; . company-complete-selection))
 (:map lsp-mode-map
 (&quot;&quot; . company-indent-or-complete-common))
 :custom
 (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
 (company-idle-delay 0.0))
 ​
 (use-package company-box
 :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))
 ​
 (use-package importmagic
 :ensure t
 :config
 (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook &#x27;importmagic-mode)) 
 ​
 ​
 Maybe I just need a clear example of how to set up LSP properly, thanks in advance guys, sorry if im asking anything too obvious/stupid

 I can&#x27;t see anything like that in the options.
 Is there some way to do that directly in Git?

 I am not sure whether some or all of the files which remaining in the repo subdirectories need to be copied to the top level themesdirectory, but I presume that some of the files may be necessary to the full and correct functioning of the themes, such as the contents of their img directories.
 There is also the matter of not being able to commit their directories because they are git repos themselves and I don&#x27;t know how useful it may be to add them as sub-repos.
 How do I work my way around this?
 Is there some means of installing a theme by running some additonal code in some files it is associated with or is just copying the main theme files to your themes folder enough?
 Maybe my theme installation code needs to iterate every directory in the themes directory and execute a file .el matching the directory name, rather than just placing them in the themes directory?

                              <span>I have a file I depend on daily for a reference that is getting quite long. I export it as an html file with org-info.js. Because of how og-info.js works, it is loading slowly and flashes as the js waits and tries to determine how long the file is and all its headers (I think this is how it works).
 I was just reading about css :has() property and thought, why can&#x27;t that be used in loading up an exported html file?
 What I want as an end result is a Table of Contents, and then clicking on each link, displays the section under that org heading with links to sub-headings.
 I think the closest alternative is the ReadTheOrg theme, but I would like it without a sidebar.
 Anyone know any alternatives or js free versions?
 If not, any guidance on how I would approach this situation with my own css and if needed only minimal js?

I can see globals using ESS-rdired. But when I step through a debug browser(), I would like rdired to update to show only the local variables. I can inspect them via the console but the immediate overview is an RStudio advantage for me. Am I missing something? How do you R experts on Emacs deal with it?

                              <span>Hi everybody!
 I&#x27;m a Software Engineer Master student (2nd semester) located in Denmark, and have recently chosen to quit my previous student job meaning I&#x27;m currently looking for a new one. I&#x27;d love to get to develop in Haskell (I know it&#x27;s most likely not possible), and was wondering if anyone knows any company/project that may be willing to have a student worker, most likely remotely?
 I&#x27;ve programmed in Haskell for a bit more than a year now, and have recently passed a functional programming course at my university (1st semester on the master), where we programmed in Haskell.
 Please let me know if I should fill my post with additional info (experience, preferences, etc.).
 Thank you for your help!

 After further research, I’ve come to an assessment that Haskell is considered a “white paper” language that isn’t used outside of universities and enthusiasts. I’ve looked into it a bit, as well as other functional languages and realized I’ve been using functional programming for most of my career without really considering it. I use power query from excel for data migration, and it is a functional language called “m code” that is related to F#.
 I think it may be worth while to learn Haskell, mainly as it forms the foundation of many Domain Specific Languages in the research papers I’ve been reading, but it led me to think maybe Haskell has untapped potential on AI driven development.
 Because Haskell’s stigma as a “whitepaper” language, and often not used outside of the academic setting (just as viewed from outside observation), wouldn’t code quality in training datasets naturally be of a higher quality than the sea of sloppy JavaScript and terabytes of poorly written Python scripts?
 Has anyone experimented with ai generated Haskell code?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been fascinated by haskell for many years. Until recently, however, I didn&#x27;t have a compelling enough project for me to grit my teeth and work through all the issues associated with learning to program in a language properly.
 Last year, my wfie and I walked the Camino Santigo and, since I had plenty of time to think and not much else to do, I started to think about how to better plan the daily stages. It takes 30-40 days to complete and guidebooks tend to give stages for a &quot;normal&quot; pilgrim; we discovered that we started flagging at about 25km or so.
 So building a Camino planner that optimises the stages for the entire journey, based on people&#x27;s preferences in terms of distance, time, accommodation etc. became that project.
 You can give the result a spin at https://de-calixtinus.org It&#x27;s a yesod website that uses dynamic programming to plan out the route. The source code is at https://github.com/charvolant/de-calixtinus
 I&#x27;m painfully aware that this has been a learning project. You can see traces of it where, for example, I&#x27;ve become comfortable with something like applicative programming but haven&#x27;t got around to rethinking previous stuff in the light of my new knowledge. Yesod is a bugger to learn and the scaffolding makes it wilfully obscure, so you can see where I&#x27;ve been going through things in a step-wise fashion, slowly pulling stuff in from the scaffolding once I&#x27;ve understood what&#x27;s going on. The fields work, but there&#x27;s obviously more stuff needed. The configuration is trapped partway between where it was a stand-alone program and where it became a web application. And so on.
 If any kind soul wanted to look over the code and suggest improvements or completely better ways of looking at things, I&#x27;d be most grateful.

                              <span>Hi! I’m fairly new to org-mode, and trying to set it up for academic reasons. I’m studying engineering, so I’m seriously eyeing the inline LaTeX rendering capabilities of org-mode for notetaking. I first downloaded MiKTeX and installed it with the provided installer (it seems like dvipng is included in MiKTeX) then tried configuring org-mode to render with dvipng, by adding the following to my init.el file:
 (setq org-preview-latex-default-process &#x27;dvipng) (setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program &#x27;dvipng) (setq org-preview-latex-process-alist &#x27;((dvipng :programs (&quot;latex&quot; &quot;dvipng&quot;) :description &quot;dvi &gt; png&quot; :message &quot;you need to install the programs: latex and dvipng.&quot; :image-input-type &quot;dvi&quot; :image-output-type &quot;png&quot; :image-size-adjust (1.0 . 1.0) :latex-compiler (&quot;latex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f&quot;) :image-converter (&quot;dvipng -fg %F bg %B -D %D -T tight -o %O %f&quot;)) )) 
 However, if I type some inline LaTeX in an org-mode file and try to compile it with C-c C-x C-l, I get the following message: 
 Creating LaTeX previews in region... org-compile-file: File &quot;c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi&quot; wasn’t produced. Please adjust ‘dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’. 
 Does anyone know what I might have done wrong? I read this post, but no log files seem to have been generated for me. If I run &quot;latex c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.tex&quot; in the command line it generates a dvi file of the same name; running &quot;dvipng c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTelk2W.dvi&quot; seems to also generate a proper png image with the same name. When I check the log for generating the dvi file, it provides a bunch of information but seemingly does not show any errors.

 * TODO APT B7 Blinds :sometag:someothertag: - State &quot;TODO&quot; from [2024-03-30 Sat 23:02] \\ B7 requested blinds. 
 Now, in my mind, I want to have a connected task such as &quot;order blinds&quot; somewhere relating to this particular TODO entry -- I&#x27;m thinking in another org file of just orders. This orders.org will then have a header 
 * Order B7 Blinds :sometag: 
 then I make it TODO and add details of the ordering to the note. I come from the relational database world where the instinct is not to crowd everything into one table, rather create a new table to normalize. But is that &quot;best practice&quot; with org-agenda? My instinct is to separate out all the stages, parts of the project install blinds. However, what I might have seen so far is people simply adding sub-headings for each sub-task, stage, etc. So the ordering blinds might be a sub-heading TODO? Or perhaps just more added list items? What&#x27;s the best practice here?

                              <span>TL;DR
 When exporting (to PDF or HTML) an Org file containing lisp blocks, what might cause a lisp error that goes away without making any changes to the file in question, but only if I close and re-open emacs having first run desktop-clear?
 Details
 I&#x27;m converting my emacs config to use babel, and so I&#x27;m currently hacking and pruning and generally beating my init.el into shape in the new form of a new and nicely narrated config.org.
 From time to time, when I try to export the growing org file, I&#x27;m running into an error of the form: Wrong type argument: listp ... always in reference to the same setq of one particular variable. However, if instead of exporting I simply tangle the .org to produce the target .el, the tangling reports no error, and the resulting lisp is all fine too. Export …</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I working on a personal project in which I am signing up users. I am taking their password, hashing it using password and wanting to store it in the postgresql db. I was using Generic instance so far. But it seems the &#x60;PasswordHash&#x60; type does not have instance of ToRow.
 One solution that is coming to my mind is to unwrap the PasswordHash type and store the text in the DB.

After that, any attempts to create a new frame will result in frozen frames; I just see the &quot;When done with this frame...&quot; message in the minibuffer, and otherwise have no keyboard input. The same thing happens with emacs -Q. 
 If I open a client or instance in the terminal, however, everything works fine. With clients, I&#x27;ve tried looking at messages, but I don&#x27;t see anything out of the ordinary. Is there anything I can do to try to pinpoint the issue?
 I am using fcitx5, if that has any potential consequences.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Whenever I press Enter to insert a new line org inserts comma before the asterisks making it look like the following After block.
 Before:
  #+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.config/excludes.conf *text_with_asterisk *some_file_extension #+end_src 
 After:
  #+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.config/excludes.conf ,*text_with_asterisk ,*some_file_extension #+end_src 
 When I use C c &#x27; to edit the block in its own buffer or tangle it out to a file the commas are removed.
 What is the purpose of this?

                              <span>I would like something like vscode workspaces or pycharm when u add multiple projects to the same session.
 The 2 most important features I am missing is
 I&#x27;d like to search for files from all 10 projects I have (they are somehow interconnected)
 I&#x27;d like to search and replace/ grep in all projects.
 Whenever im in a specific file I should get all the configurations of the specific project

                              <span>Emacs noob btw. I have artix (with openRC) and recently updated my system. Now emacs just doesn&#x27;t render or renders &quot;garbage&quot;. In bspwm, plasma(X11) and plasma(Wayland) it just renders glitches, in dwm just a plain black screen. My primary card is the one that comes with intel, I also have an nvidia and I double checked but if you think that&#x27;s the problem give me a command and I&#x27;ll give you the output. Ty in advance.

I thought I&#x27;ll create a simple cheat sheet for my own reference for my often-used functions, thought it&#x27;ll be useful to the community too. Here you go

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to using lsp, just set it up this afternoon based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Yah69AfYP34.
 I opened a file in my project and was prompted to import the project root, that worked great (that&#x27;s fll-sw/working-dir below). My project is built using gradlew.
 I then started a new git worktree in issues/1168... and opened a file in there. I got errors about all kinds of missing imports. When I run lsp-describe-session I get the output below. The file &quot;Playoff.java&quot; has been opened from issues/1168, the other files are opened from fll-sw/working-dir. I see that the jdtls process id is the same for both directories and that seems odd to me given that they are different projects.
 Can someone point me to documentation on what I&#x27;m not doing correctly here?

                              <span>Hello ! 
 I&#x27;m getting into FP and I was wondering of how hard &amp; practical it would be implement Leetcode type of questions in a purely functional way (Scala for instance).
 I do feel not using any mutable variable would make some algorithms more complicated to implement. The code would be perhaps harder to read. Sometimes less efficient as well. 
 What are your thoughts on this? Would you say FP and immutability make sense for some more or less complex algorithms? 
 Also, once again I&#x27;m no FP expert but I&#x27;d tend to think it&#x27;s okay to have mutable state if the method do not produce any real side effects. As long as no class instance variables or global variables are mutated by a method, having some &quot;var&quot; inside a method can be an okay choice if it makes the code more readable and efficient. Why would it be so bad to have a &quot;var&quot; inside a pure method? 
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts. 
 Thanks in advance!

 I don&#x27;t see that it has a backend on &#x60;auth-sources&#x60;, and the closest thing I found is integrating keyctl in: https://github.com/jpathy/emacs-keyctl

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of an emacs package to support SysML?
 I use plantUML with org mode, and get great drawings (and terrible indenting) but its not really the same thing.
 Trying to stay as text-based as possible, with the ability to render docs and drawings.

 This does not happen with Emacs -Q. 
 In an elisp buffer, I checked flymake-running-backends and I got Running backends: elisp-flymake-checkdoc, elisp-flymake-byte-compile. And yes, it is indeed working. But it always pops up this error and it&#x27;s very annoying.
 Yes, I have tried bisecting my config but nothing seems to pop up.
 My flymake config:
 (use-package flymake :elpaca nil :hook (emacs-lisp-mode . flymake-mode) :custom (flymake-fringe-indicator-position &#x27;right-fringe))

                              <span>The title is mostly ironic. If you have reasons please share though.
 Emacs seems to have a marketing problem.
 Its almost everyday that I see videos that talk about using Vim and its derivatives and it&#x27;s generally positive.
 On the otherhand when I look on YouTube &quot;why use Emacs&quot;, the search indexes plenty of videos saying why you shouldn&#x27;t.
 Maybe this just says something about the recommendation engine&#x27;s belief about what I&#x27;ll watch is, but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m making this thread.
 I&#x27;m a newb so I&#x27;m still learning a lot and that&#x27;s really the main drive for me. I can&#x27;t remember what made me invest into Emacs, but I think it had to do with Vim changing conventions every couple years while Emacs seems stable and centralized to its ways.
 What&#x27;s your experience?

 This prevents buffers that - i don&#x27;t want to get displayed as a tab - from getting displayed. How do i make every time C-x C-f is called open the file in a new centaur-tab instead of a normal Emacs buffer? I want multiple files to be open side-by-side...
 Thanks in advance, Emacs noob

                              <span>I was a heavy user of Emacs + org-mode. I really love(d) org-roam, had thousands of notes in it, would navigate them in a second, create powerful org-documents. But I felt the pain of not having access to my files on the go (both task management and notes). That&#x27;s when I heavy heartedly switched to Obsidian for note taking and OmniFocus for task and project management.
 So I took the plunge and invsted a good amount of time into migrating my org-mode files into markdown files, and migrate them into my vault in Obsidian.
 As I missed a good editor in Obsidian for long documents, I asked myself recently why not edit my markdown files in Emacs. After all Obsidian stores all files in markdown format in a folder that&#x27;s accessbile to any program.
 I realized that the tools I used previously in E…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 this is something that is not a problem for me, but I would like to understand what is happening as this is very strange...
 When I run graphical emacs on Linux and do a describe-face on an org-mode TODO-item I can see that the color (ie the foreground-color of the string &quot;TODO&quot;) is configured to be &quot;Red1&quot;. This seems to be the default, I did not customize it.
 When I do the same thing in a terminal emacs (same config-file) with TERM&#x3D;xterm-256color I get the same, however if I run a terminal emacs with TERM&#x3D;tmux-256color this foreground color suddenly changes to &quot;Pink&quot;.
 So how does changing the value of the TERM environment variable change the color-name?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started using the following to give me boxes around code blocks when exporting to PDF via LaTeX.
 #+BEGIN_mdframed #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp ;; Some lisp goes in here #+END_SRC #+END_mdframed 
 But I&#x27;m having to add those two additional lines around every separate block I want framed (which is almost all of them). Is there a way I can avoid that? 
 For example, is there perhaps an argument I can add to each #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp line itself, to say &quot;oh, and frame this while you&#x27;re at it&quot;? That would allow me to continue to exclude those few blocks that I do not want framed (mainly because I&#x27;m already using :exports none to stop them reaching the PDF at all). So, something like this for blocks to be framed:
 #BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :do-the-mdframed-thing yes 
 and for those not to be framed (because they&#x27;re not being exported to the PDF in the first place) just continuing with their current:
 #BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none 
 Alternatively, is there perhaps some directive at or above file scope -- maybe something in a #+: line at the top of the file? -- which would make mdframing be the default for all code blocks, but for which there is an &quot;off&quot; switch that could be applied individually to the exceptions?

                              <span>For example, when calling consult-recent-file, if I use embark-act to call embark-collect, the resulting buffer cannot preview files. I also try to use embark-act to call embark-live, in this way, preview works well, but the minibuffer coexists with the embark live buffer. My question is can I make the live preview work, while avoiding the two buffers issue in embark-live?

 CUA works perfectly, but in ORG mode, in spite of

 Are there any special tricks? How can I make it work?

                              <span>You guys also?
 I&#x27;m using copilot system when I develop C++ 
 And so, I&#x27;m using copilot.el mode
 (https://github.com/copilot-emacs/copilot.el)
 But, I think that it&#x27;s to cause that to occur many times of garbage-collection
 When I only used eglot-mode, Garbage collections were not occured many times.
 Of course, I have set a big-value to gc-cons-threshold in my eglot settings.
 (use-package eglot :ensure t :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;&quot; . jo/company-complete-common) ) :config (require &#x27;eglot) (setq eglot-send-changes-idle-time 0.1) (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 50 1024 1024)) (setq garbage-collection-messages t) (setq original-gc-cons-threshold gc-cons-threshold) (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum) (add-hook &#x27;emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold original-gc-cons-threshold))) ) (use-package copilot :quelpa (copilot :fetcher github :repo &quot;copilot-emacs/copilot.el&quot; :branch &quot;main&quot; :files (&quot;dist&quot; &quot;*.el&quot;)) :config (add-hook &#x27;prog-mode-hook &#x27;copilot-mode) (setq copilot-indent-offset-warning-disable t) (setq copilot-max-char 500000) ) 
 I don&#x27;t know What is the cause of the symptom exactly.
 I think It must be copilot.el Because
 When I enabled copilot.el, It occurred many times

                              <span>Hello there!
 I am trying to setup markdown mode ts using only the default Emacs with treesit (not installing the markdown-mode package).
 Is it possible? I&#x27;ve been trying like this.
  (use-package markdown-ts-mode :ensure nil :mode (&quot;\\.md\\&#x27;&quot; . markdown-ts-mode) :defer &#x27;t :custom (markdown-indent-level 2) :config (treesit-parser-create &#x27;markdown) (add-to-list &#x27;treesit-language-source-alist &#x27;(markdown &quot;https://github.com/ikatyang/tree-sitter-markdown&quot; &quot;master&quot; &quot;src&quot;))) 
 But when I open a .md file I get:  File mode specification error: (file-missing Cannot open load file No such file or directory markdown-ts-mode) 
 I am not sure how to accomplish this manual configuration regarding a non pre-existent mode to &quot;remap&quot; into &quot;-ts-mode&quot;.

                              <span>I am presently using emacs 29.1 from railwaycat/emacs-mac and it works great, but I want to start using emacs 30.0.50, since it seems stable enough to be a daily driver for what I use and I want to use lldb, which is supported in emacs 30. 
 I tried emacs 30 from both emacsformacosx, as well as from d12frosted/emacs-plus, and both worked great, but the only thing that I miss is that they don&#x27;t recognize the back button on my logitech mouse.
 I don&#x27;t mind trying to build from source, but I want to know how railwaycat/emacs-mac recognizes the back button. I find it very helpful for using with lsp-mode to jump back to where I came from. (I know that I can use M-, for it, but it is not as convenient for me.) I use it as:
 (define-key prog-mode-map [swipe-left] &#x27;xref-go-back)

                              <span>There are many topics about the use of AI in our workflows. I&#x27;ve Initially started to write in one of these, but I think that this question could be considered on it own. With a well made title...
I&#x27;ve very negative thoughts about the use of AI in personal knowledge processing and development.
Maybe I could change my mind in the future, reasoning and contextualize better on different use cases.
Into my notes I&#x27;ve already put a set of &quot;notemaking fallacies&quot; regarding AI 
Automatic classification fallacy
Automatic linking fallacy
Automatic summarization fallacy
The underlying principle is the same for all of them.
The effort of doing these things is tiring and takes time, but it&#x27;s thinking itself. 
Discovering and using Zettelkasten in the last two years I&#x27;ve relearned to think. Before this time, I collected.
For me Zettelkaten and AI are highly incompatible. At least for the &quot;core tasks&quot;,  those in which we need to use a lot of thinking.

 Why you should care!
 Biparsing is a bidirectional programming technique that specializes in constructing parsing and printing programs simultaneously.
  
Less Bugs, keeps the programs in sync so that when the biparsing code is modified both the parser and printer are updated
 Less Costs, reduces maintenance and upgrade costs since changes only need to be made in a single location
 Less Code, reduces project size in &quot;half&quot; (perhaps a third) since two parts are written simultaneously

 Release notes:
  
This release fixes potential bugs. Given the change in the default value of the urls key, Stack users are recommended to update to this version to avoid having to configure that key in YAML configuration files.
  
Changes since v2.15.3:
 Behaviour changes:
  
Following the handover of the Stackage project to the Haskell Foundation, the default value of the urls key is latest-snapshot: https://stackage-haddock.haskell.org/snapshots.json.
 Stack no longer includes the snapshot package database when compiling the setup executable for a package with build-type: Configure.
  
Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

                              <span>Several months ago, I sent a request to join the Haskell Gitlab.
 It was just rejected. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I totally forgot I had sent it during this time, as I had assumed nobody would ever see the request.
 I can understand not approving random people&#x27;s requests, but I can&#x27;t find any actual instructions on how to open an account, send PR&#x27;s, etc.
 Thanks in advance.

 If there are any org-contacts users out there, what do you do when you want to record multiple email addresses or multiple phone numbers?
 I guess I can just use :EMAIL1: and :EMAIL2: for example, but I feel like that doesn&#x27;t match the built in expectations of the org-contacts package.
 Any thoughts?

 As of now, it has a considerable amount of work to be put into its development till it reaches a state of &quot;release&quot;.
 Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not many people engaged in functional programming enough for Idris to get wide support on its development (both with volunteers and monetarily), so the development is way slower in comparison to languages like Rust (that got very popular).
 Do you expect Idris to &quot;release&quot; in the next 10 years?

                              <span>Hey guys! I have 6 years experience with programming, I&#x27;ve been programming the most with Python and only recently started using Rust more.
 1 week ago I saw a video about Haskell, and it really fascinated me, the whole syntax and functional programming language concept sounds really cool, other than that, I&#x27;ve seen a bunch of open source programming language made with Haskell.
 Since I&#x27;m unsure tho, convince me, why should I learn it?

 I&#x27;ve reached another milestone in my tinkering with tab-line. I now have integrated custom grouping with some extensions for project, basic integration with the desktop functionality to save tab info, some modeline integration and most excitingly views that mimic tab-bar and allow lightweight spaces that preserve window-configuration and tab lists. 
 Note: in the demo I am focused mostly on mouse based interactions but there are commands/initial keybindings too. 
 I&#x27;m still trying out the total ui experience on a day to day basis and tinkering with the code. But I think I&#x27;ve slipped part of the way over the line between configuration and becoming a full blown package.
 That&#x27;s also made me go back and look at other tab packages to see if I ended up reinventing the wheel. So far I think this is something a bit new. 
 Besides show and tell - I&#x27;m interested in feedback / UI thoughts.

                              <span>I have a problem that I can&#x27;t seem to understand how it&#x27;s caused.
 I have been using eglot for R programming localy and everything works fine.
 When I connect to a file at a remote server and start eglot, it reports that it connects to languageserver correctly, completions happen for a brief moment but then the server seems to hang.
 A big message that looks like a .json line appears on the echo area, that seems to be some flymake diagnostics among other things. I have managed to capture this on the Warnings buffer, if anyone is interested.
 I don&#x27;t know if I should make a bug report on the eglot project or on corfu (that I use for in-buffer-completions)
 My config can be found here if anyone is interested: https://github.com/Himsself1/My-.emacs-configuration
 *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 I start emacs with the following command: &quot;emacs -q --load ~/my-emacs-config/init.eglot.el&quot; so that it only uses the init.eglot.el file.
 Any advise would be greatly appreciated!
 Edit. Warnings buffer at: https://gist.github.com/Himsself1/b2338e54e4b9e98474aa344f84ebf668

 So here are some badges i made:

                              <span>I just started using source blocks in org-mode. I did the following steps 
  
Using M-x customize-variables RET org-babel-load-languages I added Shell, Python and LaTeX.
 Using M-x customise-variable RET exec-path I added the paths to python3 and my tex distribution. 
  
a) Now when I added a sh-source block and used C-c C-c the result gets printed as expected. 
 b) However when I do the same for a python-source block I got an error zsh:1: command not found: python [Babel evaluation exited with code 127]
 c) As for the LaTeX I am not sure if I am getting the expected result. Here is my source block
 #+begin_src latex
 $x^3$
 #+end_src
 and here is the output
 #+RESULTS:
 #+begin_export latex
 $x^3$
 #+end_export
 ​
 How do I get the python source block to compile properly? Is my LaTeX compiling as expected?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been synchronising my org-roam files between computers and mobile phone. For a while I&#x27;ve been mostly successfully being able to use Emacs in Termux for org-roam on my mobile phone. 
 However, in the past few months any org-roam &#x27;look-up&#x27; operations, like org-roam-node-insert, org-roam-node-find, &amp;c. have become slower and slower. Worse, in the past couple of months, after doing one or two such operations it seems to get stuck indefinitely, and trying to cancel out with C-g does nothing the first time, and kills Emacs the second time.
 I&#x27;m not sure whether the issue is that my org-roam file library has continued to grow or whether it&#x27;s to do with changes to Android (there have been a few Android OS updates in that time period). Or whether the issue is with accessing a larger sqlite database or whether it&#x27;s to do with the actual file-lookup operations (more org-roam files over time).
 Is anyone in a similar situation? Any ideas of how to resolve this? Maybe at the Termux level? (I saw, for instance, a Termux &#x27;no-root-ram-booster&#x27; [ https://github.com/White9shadow/no-root-ram-booster ] but haven&#x27;t tried it or know whether it would be at all relevant. But have wondered about things like this - some way of affecting things at the Termux-level.)

                              <span>I am having troubles understanding how the file handlers work from the documentation. Particularly in the make-process :file-handler.
 I understand that I should provide an alist with the form (regexp . handler) however, I cannot figure out how can I ask my handler to call the process in a given path.
 I have the following:
  (make-process :name &quot;my-R-async&quot; :buffer &quot;my-R-async&quot; :command (list &quot;Rscript&quot; &quot;app.R&quot;) :connection-type &#x27;pty)  However, this only works if I call make-process from the same dir where my app.R is. Therefore, I am trying to find a handler that can call make-process from a particular dir.
 I have tried a few things, including :file-handler (unhandled-file-name-directory &quot;~/Projects/myApp/&quot;) and :file-handler (&quot;~/Projects/myApp/&quot; . unhandled-file-name-directory), I have tried with other functions replacing unhandled-file-name-directory and sometimes writing the full path of the file rather than only the directory, but nothing seems to work.
 I have currently a solution by providing the path to R directly, sending the command setwd() but a workaround and I really would like to learn and understand how Emacs can handle this.

Currently, I am doing a research paper for my masters theses about the impact of AI in software development and I would really appreciate if you guys could spare a minute to tell me how AI impacted your days as engineers. Survey is short and anoynmous. I would really appreciate it!

Announcing Imp, a GHC plugin for automatically importing modules by Taylor Fausak
Typically in Haskell you have to import things before you can use them. This is widely considered to be a good idea. However sometimes it’s convenient to use something without importing it, as long as that thing is unambiguous.

 I have a keymap that binds a mouse press to an interactive command:
 ;; keymap to wire the new desktop button to tab2-new-dektop (defvar-keymap tab2-new-desktop-map &quot; &quot; #&#x27;tab2-new-desktop &quot;RET&quot; #&#x27;tab2-new-desktop) 
 Where the command is really vanilla:
 ;; Create a new desktop and switch to it. (defun tab2-new-desktop (name) (interactive &quot;sNew Desktop name: &quot;) ..... 
 This all works as expected, except the focus doesn&#x27;t switch to the minibuffer automatically when the mouse is pressed. You have to do so manually. Does anyone know how to make that happen?

If that is true, how can I trick python into thinking it is? It is very normal practice to have this line in my code, and I would like to still be able to run my code in emacs without too much restructuring of my life.

Only gives me blank &quot; &quot; so it seems that Emacs can not find my home directory or my init.el file regardless if I load it or not. I know my file is loaded as it shows up in *Messages* but the variable is still empty.
 I have compiled Emacs from source using pgtk for Wayland along with native compilation as well as with json and a few others. My version is Emacs 30.0.50, at the moment I am starting Emacs via kde5 desktop, but if also had same problem running it in terminal.
 My environment variables are set even moved to the XDG standard, set XDG_CONFIG_HOME to proper location. But still getting an empty init-user-file, wonder exactly how to figure this out.

 After hitting C-c y C-h, the C-h page displays something like this 
 C-c y ( .. C-c y ) kill-region 
 It seems this only happens to ( and ) bound to the same command. E.g. If I bind both  to the same command, C-h displays correctly.
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c y &quot;) &#x27;kill-region) 
 C-h shows:
 C-c y  kill-region 
 Does anybody know this is by design or a bug ? btw, I&#x27;m running v29.2.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m running into the following issue with python windows in emacs 29.1 on OSX. Buffers end up being duplicated in certain conditions. I&#x27;ve started emacs using &quot;emacs -Q&quot; so this is all using the default settings. 
  
I like to have my *Python* shell buffer under my python code buffer. (see below)
  
1. Initial setup with Python source code buffer above *Python* shell buffer.
  
When executing the code buffer with C-c C-c the code buffer ends up being duplicated on the bottom right (see below)
  
2. Code buffer duplicated on bottom right after running C-c C-c
  
Even worse if I then move to the Python shell buffer and press , the Python shell buffer ends up being duplicated on the top right (see below)
  
​
 3. *Python* shell buffer is duplicated on top right when pressing  in bottom left window
 Obviously this isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d expect, I&#x27;d like to keep the initial layout and end up with 
 ​
 4. expected layout instead of 2 and 3. 
 I came across this fantastic guide on managing windows https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager#templates-examples 
 so I tried customising the display-buffer-alist variable using
 (add-to-list &#x27;display-buffer-alist
 \((or (derived-mode . python-mode) (derived-mode . inferior-python-mode))&#x60;
 (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-reuse-mode-window)
 (inhibit-same-window . nil)))
 but that&#x27;s making no difference here, I get the same behaviour as before. 
 ​
 Couple of questions
  
Are others able to reproduce this issue?
 Is there a way to configure display-buffer-alist to avoid seeing my python source and shell buffers duplicated and get screenshot 4 instead of 2 or 3?
  
Grateful for any tips!

 But xcscope take a long time to search symbol &#x60;C-c,s,s&#x60; (60s) as if &#x60;cscope.out&#x60; was not used.
 If I use &#x60;cscope -d&#x60; or another editor to use cscope it is quick (1s) and it use only &#x60;cscope.out&#x60;.
 I tried also that with no effect : 
 (setq cscope-do-not-update-database t) 
 Is there a way to use xcscope plugin or other to use only &#x60;cscope.out&#x60; and have a quick search?

                              <span>I have a few questions for Elisp connoisseurs and Emacs package creators, do you test your code? What&#x27;s the best practices for testing Elisp these days? 
  
Do you use buttercup, ert, maybe something else? What are the reasons to choose one over another?
 
How do you structure the project? Most simple packages (at least the shit I come up with) fit in a single file. Where do you place the tests? In a file next to it, in a sub-folder? Are there any file naming conventions?
 
What do you use for CI? There&#x27;s a lot of Emacs stuff on GitHub (even though many advocates of FOSS trying use other places like Codeberg). Do you use GitHub Actions? Can you show me some nice examples to borrow ideas from?
 
 In general, I rarely see packages that have test coverage. I&#x27;m not sure why. Is it because of the dynamic, malleable nature of Lisp - you write a function, evaluate it on the spot, and if it works, you happily forget about it?

                              <span>I am running Arch/Xomand (so X) on an XPS13 laptop. I installed emacs 29.3 from the AUR, then doom emacs, accoriding to https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org}
 When I launch the binary, my configuration is respected: for example: 
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/qsd94tjr0tqc1.png?width&#x3D;967&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;37aa64aae7fcd651e9b0e5ae2d398a139480fac1
 But when I use emacsclient (with any of the usual flags), my comfiguration is not sourced entirely, I lose cursor size/shape, imeages etc. Like so: 
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/sg14veh11tqc1.png?width&#x3D;1165&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;f5648dad587435fa5f265438dabfedd71ef1254f
 I tried downgrading emacs to 29.2, to no effect. I did a full reinstall of both emacs and doom but the problem persists. I can reproduce the issue on my other laptop which is also an XPS13, running Arch/Hyprland (so Wayland). 
 Is this a bug in the new emacs version? It is not a doom issue, the problem seems to be with the client.

                              <span>I have this annoying issue with Emacs server¹. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually dies or simply cannot be accessed for whatever reason.
 So, I very often call emacsclient from my WM to spawn a new buffer to edit something (the details of all that, I think irrelevant). After a while though, it stops to work. If I try to poke to it from the terminal doing something trivial like this:
 $ emacsclient -e &#x27;(message &quot;yo&quot;)&#x27; emacsclient: can&#x27;t find socket; have you started the server? emacsclient: To start the server in Emacs, type &quot;M-x server-start&quot;. emacsclient: No socket or alternate editor. ... 
 It doesn&#x27;t find it and I have to M-x server-start. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s causing this. server-stop-automatically var is nil.
 Does anyone know anything about this? I&#x27;m using --HEAD version on Arch and I have experienced the same thing on Mac too, but it was a while ago. Any ideas how to troubleshoot this?
  
1 - Sorry, Reddit doesn&#x27;t let me change the title of the post. I meant to say &quot;server&quot; and not &quot;daemon&quot;. Apparently, there&#x27;s a difference.

 I’m reading book about code reading and the author suggests regular expressions, ctags and grep.
 This book is kind of old.
 Are there better tools now or are these still solid? Also can you describe how you investigate a large codebase? Thanks

                              <span>Hey Folks, I have recently joined an org which uses Scala only for the Backend tasks. I came from the Go Lang background where I can see hell lot of opportunities. But in Scala things are little bit opposite, you need to search for the job role and still there are less chances. I miss the motivation of work after thinking all of these things because of no such scope in future. I have worked on Kotlin earlier and liked that because that is high demand language. Can someone help me if I&#x27;m taking it in wrong way.... and sorry for such a noob question but it is something which disturb me sometimes 
 YOE: 3
 Edit: Thank you to the community for the comments, they are really helpful. I will strengthen and learn more about Scala language, as ppl are already loving it 🙌

                              <span>Hi.. I have seen others comment in many forums that Haskell has a repl and it’s a great tool for learning.. I have used ghci myself and I have two questions.. 
 Most of the code which is more than 10 lines or has more than two to three imports have to be script based.. so how is ghci load and run better than cabal run or stack run ? 
 Also I found multiline code and package import in ghci a lot more difficult
 I have been able to use ghci only where I want to test and isolated function before I type it into the main program.. 
 Are there any other ways to use repl better ? Or is this the best one can do ?
 In general how does a language which has a repl tool do better than one without ?

 unfortunately the normal orgmode-checkboxes do not work in tables or properties.
 What do you use as a replacement?
 I am looking for something that can represent a boolean value and can be toggled with a key stroke.
 Is there any package for that?

                              <span>lets-plot is a ggplot port to python. I&#x27;m trying to display the output plot in org buffer. 
 If I run this as is I get:
 #+begin_src jupyter-python :session *py* p &#x3D; ggplot(df, aes(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;)) + geom_point() p #+end_src #+RESULTS: :  
 I can do:
 #+begin_src jupyter-python :session *py* p &#x3D; ggplot(df, aes(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;)) + geom_point() p.to_png(&quot;test.png&quot;) #+end_src 
 Which outputs a file path: 
 #+RESULTS: : /Users/elan_braude/test.png 
 Which I can then manually wrap in double brackets and get an image inline.
 ​
 So question number 1: How can I make code block automatically wrap file path in double brackets? Or more generally is there a setup where I can just eval the ggplot function and get an inline image? i.e. as opposed to calling .to_png() every time.
 Question number 2: lest-plot default output is html with tooltips, is it somehow possible to get org-mode to render this inline? or at least have it exported?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been an org mode user for around 3 years now, I use it for practically everything task- and note-oriented. I&#x27;m in it and emacs most of the day.
 However, the one aspect I have never quite understood is why TODOs seem the same as headings. My natural expectation is that when taking notes, especially with meetings, I want to slot in a TODO based on the context of the notes at that time. But with a TODO being a heading, all the plain text notes below it come under that heading. So I tend to have a heading at the bottom of the notes section called Tasks or something under which I enter the TODOs for that meeting, but that approach does lose the context location from the full notes--not a major issue, but flipping about to record TODOs does disrupt flow.
 So, what am I missing? I did search on this a bit and think identified that some people just use headings for the full notes, and any plain text under a heading is just brief explanation or extra detail for that heading but may be omitted altogether. However, the way headings are formatted by default with bold doesn&#x27;t feel natural for note-taking (I use Prot&#x27;s Modus themes, and then a mixture of formatting from System Crafters videos).
 Or maybe I have missed something really obvious. Whatever, any thoughts and guidance appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>I would like to do a debug-like &quot;step through&quot; of a 3.5K-line elisp program. It&#x27;s org-brain and I can&#x27;t really figure out where/what the first function call is. org-brain works by having a set of org files and the headings in org files to be ID&#x27;ed (UUID in a PROPERTIES drawer) then create a quasi-graph view of the org files and heading hierarchies in a graph/network-like child, parent, friend relationships between files and headings. So I&#x27;m trying to figure out how this whole thing starts. My guess is it takes org-element to parse out the ID attached to a file or headings, then creates some graph store cache. Or maybe not...
 Investigations found a use of org-refile here that will gather up all the headings in a designated directory, and, yes, org-brain does utilize org-refile, but just for actual refiling. Dead end. The org-brain author, who wants to not maintain anymore did say this:
  
The entries are cached and stored in memory after the first &quot;scan&quot; of a session. I think there are ways to store the cache to disk.
  
but I can&#x27;t find how this is being done. AFAICT, org-brain simply starts with some location entry, a file or heading, and simply works-crawls in whatever direction from there, i.e., there is no cache in memory or hash table. That is, org-brain is nothing but the visualization and not a graph database management app. There is something referring to .org-id-locations, but I don&#x27;t believe this is used in org-brain to create a cache. Any ideas? I basically need to step/trace through this monster. I&#x27;m guessing if I can find it&#x27;s very first action, I&#x27;ll have my best shot at figuring out if indeed everything is read and cached.

                              <span>Hi! I access my home RaspberryPi (Raspbian) from my office through my Windows 11 laptop via SSH through port forwarding. It works well. However, when I try to use Emacs on the RPi through the terminal window, the &quot;active&quot; keybindings are the Windows terminal ones. So, when I press C-v, instead of moving page down, it pastes whatever was in the Windows clipboard at the time.
 Any ideas on how to get &quot;proper&quot; Emacs behaviour? Thanks!

 Distributor ID: Ubuntu
 Description: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
 Release: 20.04
 emacs: V 26.3 with ido-mode enabled.
 When I ssh (or connect via VMWare) to my virtual machine, and try to open any file in emacs it just hangs on me. This wasn&#x27;t happening till a few weeks ago. Over the last couple of weeks, the response was slow and emacs used to start working after some delay (of few seconds to minutes), but now it just hangs (or maybe it needs more time). 
 I am not clear about where to start debugging it even. Any way to solve/debug this issue?

When a headline has vanished from the feed it is automatically marked as “obsolete” unless it has the status “immortal”. “Obsolete” headlines get removed automatically after a certain time.
  
However, in other feed readers, these headlines are, in fact, still there and have not vanished. In particular, it seems to be keeping the latest ten items as &quot;new&quot; and marking the rest as &quot;obsolete&quot;. I have searched &quot;newsticker&quot; in M-x customize, expanded every option, and C-s&#x27;d &quot;10&quot; to see if I could find a match, with no luck.

 Uncomment all the deb-src lines in /etc/apt/sources.list and run an apt update
 # Make sure to uninstall all the emacs packages if you already have it installed sudo apt-get install build-essential git gcc-version # Take note of the version here. If it says 11, for example, you need to install sudo apt install libgccjit0 libgccjit-11-dev # or if it&#x27;s 10, substitute libgccjit-10-dev, and so on sudo apt-get build-dep emacs cd ~/Downloads git clone --depth 1 -n emacs-29 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git emacs-29 cd emacs-29 ./autogen.sh ./configure --with-native-compilation # Check to make sure ./configure confirms that you have native compilation available make -j[however many cpu cores you have +1] sudo checkinstall 
 And that really is all there is to it. If you&#x27;re running this on Windows 11, running emacs &amp; from a command line will launch Weston and Emacs.

                              <span>Some time ago, i wrote myself a little Neovim plugin and i&#x27;m trying to see, if this already exists for emacs, before i go off writing a whole bunch of code.
 The idea is this: You define a regex/word to match and set a message to display next to matches. Similar in look to line-blame or such. I use this, to add custom reminders/todos/notes to a bunch of code files at once.
 An example usecase: I work with 50 or so Ansible Environments. All of which share common Group and Hostvars. Sometimes, Variables change, get deprecated or we change how certain things work. In those cases, i add a note that get&#x27;s displayed next to that variable. That way, when i&#x27;m working with an environments Group Vars, i can see when there&#x27;s &quot;stuff to do&quot;, changes to make or such. Having this done this way, allows me to make that note once and have it work across all my files.
 Does a package like that already exist? Or am i looking to write this myself?

                              <span>I just posted a question on r/vim regarding .asv files, i.e. ASCII-separated-value files.
 Basically, I want to enter ASCII separators easily, control how they are displayed on screen (e.g. choose to display the Unit Separator as 8 spaces), and make switching displays easy.
 As a bonus, I am trying to do the following: automatically encode an .asv into the POSIX portable set (e.g. via base64) to embed it as a field in another .asv and vice versa: take an encoded field, open a buffer with the decoded .asv where it can be viewed/edited, and then automatically re-encode and re-embed into the original .asv.
 I am sure emacs can do the above as well, but I am a complete newbie when it comes to this editor, so I have no idea how it can be done. If there are any interested experts here, I&#x27;d love to learn how to do something like this; especially the customization of how separator characters are displayed in the editor.
 Thank you all!

                              <span>I use Eglot and Clangd on a code base that partly consists of Objective-C code, the rest is plain C++. Clangd crashes immediately when I open an Objective-C source file in Emacs. Apart from this, Eglot and Clangd is working very well for me, I have never seen Clangd crash in any other situation.
 I have tried both LLVM&#x27;s Clangd installed using homebrew (I&#x27;m on macOS) and the one package with Xcode, both of them exhibit the same behavior and crash when I open an Objective-C file.
 I haven&#x27;t analyzed the log from Clangd yet (available in the *Eglot events* buffer) in any detail, I first wanted to check if this is a common problem. Anybody else experiencing this?

                              <span>I’ve been an on again off again emacs user for awhile, and I’m falling into a pattern of mostly using emacs for things like org mode and heavy text editing (refactoring a file with lots of moving text around and/or macros) rather than for all development work. 
 I find a more complete IDE a better workflow for my normal development work with autocomplete, renaming symbols, building and package management, and debugging. Not that emacs can’t do all those things, just that getting things configured, set up, and working through issues is never worth it to me when I have keyboard layers that keep my hands off the mouse 90% of the time. 
 It’s got me curious how much other people use emacs in their day to day. I know the meme is that emacs in the only program you’ll ever need, and that’s true for a lot of people, but I’m curious what the numbers look like.

                              <span>I have a file, agenda.org, that contains my agenda items. Right now it&#x27;s just a few things like holidays, birthdays, and work events. When I view the agenda the work events aren&#x27;t showing up. Have I entered the events wrong? Here&#x27;s a snippet of my agenda file:
 #+TITLE: My Agenda #+AUTHOR: Brendan Leber * Holidays :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: Holiday :END: %%(org-calendar-holiday) %%(org-anniversary 1892 03 25) Tolkien Reading Day %%(org-anniversary 1934 09 09) Carl Sagan Day %%(org-anniversary 1937 09 22) Hobbit Day (%d%s) %%(org-anniversary 1999 09 13) Breakaway [Space: 1999] (%d years) * MCC :PROPERTIES: :CATEGORY: mcc :END: 2024-03-14 Payday 2024-03-28 Payday 2024-04-11 Payday 2024-04-25 Payday 
 And here is what I see when I view the agenda:
 Fortnight-agenda (W13-W14): Monday 25 March 2024 W13 Holiday: Tolkien Reading Day Tuesday 26 March 2024 Wednesday 27 March 2024 Thursday 28 March 2024 Friday 29 March 2024 Saturday 30 March 2024 Sunday 31 March 2024 Monday 1 April 2024 W14 Holiday: April Fools&#x27; Day 
 You can see that the &quot;holiday&quot; I&#x27;ve added on the 25th is there but the payday event for the 28th isn&#x27;t. How should I create these entries so I can have them show up in my morning review of my agenda? Thanks!

Automatic updates for agenda views and to-do list are now supported. Whether you edit files in Metanote or use other app to edit files in external folders, or retrieve updates from iCloud or Git, Metanote can now automatically detect changes to files and update them accordingly. Your content will always stay up to date.
 Agenda Filter support is now available, allowing you to filter schedules and to-do items directly by category, todo keyword, and tag.
 Buffer outlines now support clicking to jump to a specific headline.
 Customization of Todo Keyword icons and colors is now possible.
 More intuitive and convenient multi-buffer management is now provided. You can now directly switch buffers from the Buffer list.
 Various other optimizations have been made, resulting in increased stability.
  
​
 Regarding file synchronization, Metanote can add any external directory that supports folder-level File Provider and automatically detect file updates. Unfortunately, many cloud drives only support file-level File Provider. We have implemented the ability to add individual files to Metanote, which is still in testing and is expected to be launched in next version. Therefore, the best regular file synchronization solutions for now are:
 ​
  
iCloud, which supports folder-level File Provider and can be directly added to Metanote.
 Git, where most Git app&#x27;s directories can be directly added to Metanote. For example, with PolyGit, when you git pull, Metanote will automatically update the file content.
 Other apps that support synchronization. Most document editing apps can be directly added to Metanote, such as Obsidian and Logseq. When files in these apps are updated, Metanote will automatically handle the edited files.

                              <span>I am one of these &quot;Scala as better Java devs&quot;, working like that for years, but from time to time I am trying to explore more of Scala world with Cats Effect.
 Everytime I try to make some basic apps with Cats Effects by myself, I end up thinking that it provides a lot of great solutions for the problems I introduced by using it.
 What I understand is that making my code pure functional, will make some things like - testing or blocking IO handling easier, but at the cost of wrapping classic lines of codes in framework specific constructs. Is it worth it? I don&#x27;t feel that my code is better and more secure when I use Cats Effect compared to my FP+OOP Scala mix.
 I am used to Akka stack for backend - mostly classic actors, cluster, Akka Streams for data processing (like IoT management system for example), and just Scala for internal tools and game development. I don&#x27;t see what is the benefit of dropping my current way of using Scala and use Cats Effect/Zio instead.
 The worst thing is - that pure functional programming with Cats Effect or Zio is so popular in Scala world, that I can&#x27;t find any job not mentioning it (well, maybe some big data ones).
 Do you have any suggestions that could help me find answers for my question? Maybe effects are not suitable for my use cases? Are they better for solving some special niche problems? Which ones? Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a custom eshell-prompt-function (https://bpa.st/IUXQ) but I&#x27;m having trouble getting the eshell-prompt-regexp to match. When I change directories then the prompt is not updated to reflect the change of the proper directory that I&#x27;m in. Instead, the prompt continues pointing to my home directory and then changes to &quot;text is read only&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve tried matching in re-builder, and fiddled with rx, but I&#x27;m still not getting the expected outcome. I&#x27;d appreciate any help as I&#x27;m not very good with regex.
 All I want the end result to look like this:

                              <span>Following up on my previous post, with WSL version 2.1.5.0 and WSLg version 1.0.60, it appears that the network connection issue killing the X(Wayland) window has been remedied as per this post. The connection is restored and the X window reappears automatically (it changes the position of the icon for Emacs on the taskbar upon reconnection). So compiling from source with with-x-toolkit&#x3D;lucid seems to be a workable solution and now appears to work better than the X410 (and likely VcXsrv) solution.
 Sometimes, the X window GUI still does crash or whatever and I cannot bring it back - in which case I restart WSLg by opening a PowerShell terminal and enter wsl --system and kill the process associated with ps aux | grep /usr/bin/weston. My Emacs daemon remains running (though it seems to kill off the Python or whatever shell that was running from it, unfortunately) and I can reopen my GUI with emacsclient -c.
 The pure GTK build still hangs and becomes unresponsive as before (presumably from a network disconnection) so that does not appear to be fixed; for the time being the Lucid build is a workable solution. Hope this helps others looking for a solution on their Windows 11 laptops.

                              <span>Just like save-window-excursion but with buffers, I needed to run some code and then close any buffers that got opened during that moment.
 Apparently nothing like that exists already in Emacs so, here&#x27;s my take. Any feeedback on the code is most welcome:
 (defmacro killing-new-buffers (&amp;rest body) &quot;Run BODY and kill any buffers that were not already open.&quot; (declare (debug t)) (cl-with-gensyms (initial-buffers) &#x60;(let ((,initial-buffers (buffer-list))) (unwind-protect ,(macroexp-progn body) (dolist (b (buffer-list)) (unless (memq b ,initial-buffers) (kill-buffer b))))))) 
 EDIT: The code above was updated with your feedback, mainly u/nv-elisp, bellow is my original code:
 (defmacro with-save-buffer-list (&amp;rest body) &quot;Run BODY and kill any buffers that were not already open.&quot; (declare (debug (form body)) (indent 1)) (cl-with-gensyms (initial-buffers final-buffers new-buffers buf) &#x60;(let ((,initial-buffers (buffer-list))) (prog1 (progn ,@body) (let* ((,final-buffers (buffer-list)) (,new-buffers (cl-set-difference ,final-buffers ,initial-buffers))) (mapcar (lambda (buf) (kill-buffer buf)) ,new-buffers))))))

                              <span>I have been looking at the modern packages after moving to Emacs 29. My config was easily 15 years stale. Which brings me to yasnippets. I use this for all kinds of little things like &#x60;pdb&#x60; adds &#x60;import pdb; pdb.set_trace()&#x60; when I am python hacking. Or loading a template of a common bit of code for work. Is there something better these days?

 I&#x27;m fairly fresh into my Emacs experience but have been working through the configuration. I&#x27;ve been working on a function that checks the extension of the open file, and if it matches one of the ones I&#x27;m interested in (cpp, el, python) then it returns the Org Capture Babel src language. When I evaluate the function in my init.el, I get &quot;emacs-lisp&quot; - that&#x27;s what I want. When I attempt to put it in a template, I get an error where it says it&#x27;s expecting stringp but got nil. Toggle Debug on doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any information (I could be looking in the wrong spot.)
 (defun get-value-from-extension () &quot;Return a value based on the extension of the current buffer&#x27;s file.&quot; (interactive) (let ((extension (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name)))) (cond ((string-equal extension &quot;cpp&quot;) &quot;cpp&quot;) ((string-equal extension &quot;el&quot;) &quot;emacs-lisp&quot;) ((string-equal extension &quot;org&quot;) &quot;org&quot;) ((string-equal extension &quot;py&quot;) &quot;python&quot;) ))) ;; Org Capture Template using plain &quot;%(get-value-from-extension)&quot; 
 I could be missing something here, but have tried a lot of combinations with no success. What am I missing?

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t realize that modules were on by default in emacs builds under both linux and windows.. and how easy it is to write one. 
 I was thinking about applications where I would render into an emacs window with c++ code so my first module was a horrible hack that implements a windows box drawing call to the active HWND, It works, as long as you keep calling it so emacs doesn&#x27;t paint over it. 
 Pretty sure I&#x27;d have to modify emacs itself to make this work fully:
 - add some lisp function get the os window handle for a frame.
 - add some way to provide an elisp callback for painting a given emacs window (or buffer) that replaces the normal logic. 
 The other thing I&#x27;m tempted to do is link in my 3d engine into it so emacs can create vr worlds. Though I can&#x27;t think of any use for it off-hand.

                              <span>Is there a way to have a column view Dynamic Block base its output on multiple files (and ideally on all files in org-agenda-files)?
 I tried messing with the FILE option for the if: parameter in the block&#x27;s #BEGIN: line, but as far as I can see, it supports only a single file, but I may just be doing it wrong syntactically.
 I note that the documentation says (bold emphasis mine): &quot;Column view is a feature that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree...&quot; and I&#x27;m hoping that the word &quot;often&quot; is significant, given the context. That is, &quot;often&quot; seems to imply that while you can narrow a Dynamic Block column view to a (sub)tree, you don&#x27;t have to. On the other hand, the only other id: option that would seem to be a possibility is LABEL, and its description says (again, emphasis mine): &quot;Call column view in the tree ...&quot;, which is less hopeful.

 I&#x27;m embarking on the never-ending Emacs and Org journey. I&#x27;m starting out with one use case that seems appropriate for Emacs and Org mode, but I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out exactly how I go about getting it to work. Given the breadth and depth of Emacs and Org mode, I&#x27;m hoping someone could help me quickly get started with just the Org mode part of this task, so I can springboard off it and (begin to) learn the rest. I don&#x27;t want to fall prey to https://xyproblem.info/ so I&#x27;m going to be really detailed about what I want to do to mitigate my subsequent questions betraying what I really want. Also, I don&#x27;t want this post to come off as &quot;Hey can you solve x for me?&quot; At the bottom, I have where I&#x27;m currently at and what I&#x27;m exploring. I&#x27;d be very happy with just a &quot;Yeah, tha…</span>

                              <span>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten elispdoc to the point its usable for me, I decided to publish my work in progress init file at https://github.com/benleis1/emacs-init. I&#x27;m biased but I think I ended up with fairly good fidelity to a literate style init file. 
 This is both a demo of elispdoc - the readme.md file was autogenerated from the init.el file and a chance to share / get interesting feedback.

                              <span>hy guyz i am using following function from König website it works fine but when i run it on a heading that have a link that have describtion as well it breaks and donot yank the heading properly for example for smthing like * [[https://www.reddit.com/][Dive into anything]] it give me following [[id:b12dbb22-c214-4d0a-b2dd-ddb1782492f9][[[https://www.reddit.com/][Dive into anything]]]] instead of : [[id:b12dbb22-c214-4d0a-b2dd-ddb1782492f9][Dive into anything]] help me with you elisp skills
 the function is 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun my/copy-idlink-to-clipboard() &quot;Copy an ID link with the headline to killring, if no ID is there then create a new unique ID. This function works only in org-mode or org-agenda buffers. 
 The purpose of this function is to easily construct id:-links to org-mode items. If its assigned to a key it saves you marking the text and copying to the killring.&quot; (interactive) (when (eq major-mode &#x27;org-agenda-mode) ;switch to orgmode (org-agenda-show) (org-agenda-goto))
 (when (eq major-mode &#x27;org-mode) ; do this only in org-mode buffers (setq mytmphead (nth 4 (org-heading-components))) (setq mytmpid (funcall &#x27;org-id-get-create)) (setq mytmplink (format &quot;[[id:%s][%s]]&quot; mytmpid mytmphead)) (kill-new mytmplink) (message &quot;Copied %s to killring (clipboard)&quot; mytmplink) ))
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;&quot;) &#x27;my/copy-idlink-to-clipboard) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m having trouble setting up emojis on Doom Emacs and hoping to get some help here. I&#x27;m on WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04 jammy) on Windows 11 running Emacs 29.2 installed via snap.
 My config used to work on my previous PC just by enabling the following on init.el (https://docs.doomemacs.org/v21.12/modules/ui/emoji/) with no extra config.
 (emoji +unicode) 
 The emojis were missing on my new PC, only displaying an empty space. In an attempt to fix this, I&#x27;ve added the following lines to config.el(following instructions here: https://ianyepan.github.io/posts/emacs-emojis/)...
 (use-package! emojify :config (when (member &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; (font-family-list)) (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol (font-spec :family &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;) nil &#x27;prepend)) (setq emojify-display-style &#x27;image) (setq emojify-emoji-styles &#x27;(unicode)) ) 
 ... but as you can see, not all emojis show up correctly...

 What I really want to do is to set (setq emojify-display-style &#x27;image) though, with the following...
 (use-package! emojify :config (when (member &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; (font-family-list)) (set-fontset-font t &#x27;symbol (font-spec :family &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;) nil &#x27;prepend)) (setq emojify-display-style &#x27;unicode) (setq emojify-emoji-styles &#x27;(unicode)) ) 
 ... I get black and white emojis...

 (font-family-list) does return two instances of &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;.
 Any help appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>After recently discovering Org-Roam, I’m looking to migrate to a full Emacs setup, but there’s one non-negotiable feature I need to transfer: block references.
 Block references are links in one file to a block of text in another file by means of a uuid. The text is transcluded so you can preview the contents in any file it’s referenced and you can even see the number of backlinks to the original reference. There’s only one plugin that offers at least the uuid-based text block transclusion feature: Roam Block.
 So far, the solutions involved migrating everything from Logseq or Roam to Emacs Org-Mode, but losing block references by imputing the original referenced text in its place. I suspect the solution might look like obtaining the SQL or database file where all block uuids are referenced and somehow transfer this mapping to have the same uuid transcluded the same content. 
 If anyone has some ideas as to how to achieve this, I’m more than either to start a conversation on the how. Please understand that I’m trying to keep block references, and cannot leave them out of the solution. So far I’ve found org-transclusion, two org-Logseq scripts on Awesome Logseq, and a roam-migration script, but none of these solutions seem to migrate the block references.
 This really seems like a no-brainer to solve, but I don’t know how would the solution look like. I’m open to any solution whether migrating from Logseq or Roam, as long as block references are migrated :)

                              <span>Hey,
How long should a Note be?  Here comes a lot of bla-bla, just skip to the Itaic part: I summarised the introduction to the Zettelkasten (this -&gt; °Link°) to get an overview etc. and used 1700 words, but i think thats to much especially if I took a look at the Luhmanns Archive. I worked like with a Word document, so I made different headings and summarised different chapters of the text under them. (I copied a lot although you&#x27;re not supposed to do that)
So: how long should the different note types (literature and permanent) be, what should they contain and how many should I make on a certain topic or source? (no bla-bla anymore)
It would be nice if you could take a look at the first 2 or 3 &quot;chapters&quot; (link above) and tell me what your Zettel would look like.
cheers.</span>

                              <span>Hi.. I am a beginner in Haskell and have been going through texts like LYAH .. I keep coming across this statement &quot;Haskell is declarative programming.. Unlike C or ruby it always defines what a function is and not how it should work&quot; and i am not able to understand this part.. 
 an example given in LYAH is
 double :: Int -&gt; Int
 double x &#x3D; x * 2
 If I do the same in ruby
 def twice (x)
 p x * 2
 end
 In both cases i have expressly stated as to how the function should operate.. So why is haskell declarative and why is ruby not.. ?
 In fact in every language where we define a custom function we do have to define its implementation. so whats different about Haskell ?
 Apart from stating the types of input and output explicitly in Haskell I can see no difference apart from the syntax .
 Have i missed out something or am I stating something colossally stupid?

                              <span>I just finished moving a project (using persistent/esqueleto) from stack to cabal, cabal build/test/run are all working fine. However, if I try to &#x60;cabal install&#x60; it cant find my .persistentmodels files, as if the working directory is different between install and the other commands. Am I missing something here?

 Just to be clear, this project works fine when using &#x60;cabal build&#x60;, &#x60;cabal run&#x60; and &#x60;cabal test&#x60;.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a minor annoyance that I would like to fix/understand.
 I currently use this as org-roam capture template:
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;${slug}.org&quot; &quot;:PROPERTIES: :CREATED: ${mh/now} :END: #+title: ${title} &quot;) :immediate-finish t :unnarrowed t))) 
 I deliberately added an empty line after the title because what I want is that after capturing I want an empty line after the title and the cursor to be placed at the beginning of the next line.
 But this is not what is happening. In fact after the capture there are two empty lines created after the title but the cursor is placed on the line immediately following the title - it seems to me that it does not matter how much white space you add at the end of your template, the cursor always seems to be inserted immediately after the title.
 So my question: Is there a way to configure a capture template in such a way that after the capture the cursor is 2 lines below the title with an empy line between the title and the cursor?

                              <span>Background: I don’t know any programming languages but am open to learn a bit. I set up my Emacs and org-mode by googling and copy-pasting, so nothing systematic. I also only know very basic functions.
 Now, if I would like to rebuild everything from the scratch, and explore org-mode step-by-step and eventually making it as my systematic daily workflow, which video tutorial or article should I start? 
 I just want to start learning and enjoying org-mode as an organizing, writing workflow in my daily routine. And I would like to explore various functions in a reasonably progressive way. Something like a short video or intro article per day, and then start building up my workflow slowly but systematically, if that makes sense.
 Edit: I work in academia so my work requires a huge amount of writing, organizing, emailing, scheduling, and time-managing.

                              <span>Hi all,
 As the title suggests, when I make a new list item and go to the next line (not with M-ret just normally), it seems to get indented automatically, which I don&#x27;t want since the list item is not a nested list.
 Is this default behaviour? I even tried using the -q option with no config file but still see the same behaviour.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I frequently use goto-last-change to move to the last changes I did in the current buffer. But in org mode this command doesn&#x27;t open the headings. If the change was done in the contents of a heading and the heading is currently closed, it just moves point to the (closed) heading.
 Is there any package like consult-mark, but for the buffer-local changes saved in the undo tree?
 I like it that consult-mark opens the headings and even gives a preview. But the mark-ring needs active setting of marks, I like about goto-chg.el that it keeps track of my edits automatically.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using the emacs-wayland package on Arch Linux under KDE Plasma6 and it is running great so far. However, when Emacs starts up there&#x27;s some flickering and the initial frame size is also kinda large with the effect that the frame is sometimes positioned partly off-screen.
 Under X11 I could manage a smooth startup by tweaking a .Xresource file (background color, initial window size etc).
 Now, obviously .Xresource is not effective under Wayland as far as I understand. Is there an equivalent way to achieve the same on Wayland so I can get a smooth startup?
 Thanks

                              <span>i have written an interpreter for a language which uses parsec to parse. each parser function has the type Parser X where X is a datatype that looks like this:
  data X &#x3D; I Int | F Float | E String -- error | etc... 
 the eval function ive written looks like this
  eval :: X -&gt; State -&gt; X 
 if eval returns an error E, id like it to be able to report what line from the original text caused the error. how do people typically do this? im at a loss.

 (add-hook &#x27;python-mode-hook (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x v a&quot;) &#x27;pyvenv-activate)) 
 doesn&#x27;t do the job as it skips the part when it&#x27;s supposed to ask me the venv path, and tells me that there is a missing argument.

                              <span>I use Linux and Windows. 
 The nerd icons package works well on Linux, but on Windows I cannot seem to get icons to appear within double quotes as strings.
 I can insert icons in a buffer manually, but I am having issues setting icons in my init.el file.
 Has anyone come across this issue?

 I&#x27;ve read the documents and set my regexp to accordingly to show leading whitespaces, but I&#x27;m still seeing normal spaces (that is, spaces between characters) replaced with a dot as well. Here&#x27;s the code I have set:
 (global-whitespace-mode 1) (setq whitespace-hspace-regexp &quot;\\(^\xA0+\\)&quot;) (setq whitespace-space-regexp &quot;\\(^ +\\)&quot;) (setq whitespace-style &#x27;(face spaces trailing space-mark)) 
 and:
  (set-face-attribute &#x27;whitespace-hspace nil :foreground (get-color &#x27;darkgray) :background (get-color &#x27;black)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;whitespace-space nil :foreground (get-color &#x27;darkgray) :background (get-color &#x27;black)) (set-face-attribute &#x27;whitespace-trailing nil :font normal-font :foreground (get-color &#x27;black) :background (get-color &#x27;red)) 
 Am I doing something wrong?

 In my lisp Skript, I would like to make from the heading a string. Therefore I would like to replace/remove [51%] 
 The result should look like: ** [2024-03-21 Do] test Projekt 
 (setq TTM_Heading (replace-regexp-in-string \[[0-9]{1,3}%\] &quot;&quot; TTM_Heading))
 To match it I tried [[0-9]{1,3}%] But it stays: ** [2024-03-21 Do] test Projekt [51%]
 Any hint?

                              <span>There are some complaints here that lsp-mode/eglot is slow in certain circumstances, and can freeze emacs for a longer period of time. Can you give me a simple case how to reproduce this? Like, &quot;clone this github repo, install this language server, and then notice that lsp-mode is slow on this and that file&quot;.
 (for context, I&#x27;m working on a faster JSON parser for Emacs, and I&#x27;d like to see the effects that the new parser has on the mentioned problems)

 Here is a post covering the first topic:
 https://arialdomartini.github.io/emacs-navigate-back
 Eventually this will cover registers and bookmarks too.

                              <span>Is there any facility to auto complete font and/or font family names? 
 Ideally i would like to hook something up to the customize face buffers since they are long and easy to mistype

                              <span>I have category/tags setup such that one off events are of type Event and Recurring events are Recurring. 
 I do this so I can fitler to see upcoming one off events which tend to be actual events and recurring items which are often regular i.e. weekly occurrences like my side business meetings with my partner, weekly meetings at my normal job, weekly/monthly board game days or other items. I don&#x27;t typically want to see these recurring events when looking out 1-3 months. 
 I also use agenda icons so I categorize these with different icons so they differentiate at a glance. This all works splendidly. 
 What I&#x27;m trying to figure out however is how to quickly filter the agenda using an OR tag. If I include both Tags it will filter to events that are set to both types, which I do not do. I&#x27;ve been searching for some kind of additive list of tags. i.e. something like +TagA|+TagB but I&#x27;m not able to find any sort of OR operator within the quick filter. 
 I wanted to see if any one knows what the standard way to filter for this type of functionality would be. I&#x27;d rather not use -TAG for every tag other than the 2 I want to see.

 If $a^2&#x3D;b$ and 
 But the syntax reference writes about two of that dollar signs ($$).

 I assume I do misinterpret the syntax reference.

                              <span>I love putting my tasks into the agenda, breaking them down as much as possible, and clocking in/out whenever I start/end working on a task. standup updates are so incredibly easy because I have an extremely granular profile of how I spent my time. I have a custom buffer I can access with C-c b that&#x27;s just a dynamic org-clock-report block set to yesterday so I just update it with C-c C-c and it gives me all the time I spent on each task. 
 if you&#x27;re not using org-clock-report, please give it a try :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m using a script to translate my calendars from ics to an org file, so that scheduled events appear in my agenda. An entry in the org file has the following format, with CALENDAR being an agenda keyword:
 * CALENDAR event description
 SCHEDULED: 
 In the agenda, this might show up between two scheduled tasks, one closed and one still open, as follows:
 SomeOrgFile 09:00 Scheduled: DONE SomeTask
 CalendarOrgFile 10:00-11:00 Scheduled: CALENDAR event description
 SomeOrgFile 11:00 Scheduled: TODO SomeOtherTask
 When checking with describe-char, the org-agenda-done face applies to the DONE task and the CALENDAR event, while the org-scheduled-today face applies to the 3rd (TODO) line.
 What I want is the second line (i.e., the file name, the time, &quot;Scheduled&quot;, and the event description) to be a different color from both the first and the 3rd line. How can I achieve this?

                              <span>I want to make my own custom keymap for emacs, but I have had some trouble with it due to the fact that I do not know how to re-add the basic necessity keybindings. Meaning: all the letters of the alphabet, the tab key and the default functionality of the mouse (i.e the default behaviors when clicking, double-clicking, dragging, etc.). If you could give me the commands or show me where I can acquire them I would be very thankful. Thank you in advance.

 I know it&#x27;s lame, but configuring Emacs when I am an Elisp noob, with the support of ChatGPT, is pure pleasure. Custom functions, code refactoring, suggesting non-trivial solutions - awesome.

 Big thanks go to Luigi Sartor Piucco for the PR, Henrik Lissner for Doom Emacs, and Daniel Mendler for corfu.
 Henrik seems to be really happy about this :-)
  
It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but thanks so much for your hard work (and patience with me)! I have big plans for this module post-v3 (to phase out Company and go all in on Corfu), so I&#x27;m happy to finally get this merged. Thanks again!

                              <span>Update: I ended up recreating the same git worktree and this solved the issue. It must have been something inside the worktree data.
 Committing from magit (magit-20240320.2336, GNU Emacs 29.2 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32) of 2024-02-01, Windows 10) seems to have recently broken on my machine.
 In magit, with staged changes, I press C C, the commit message buffer is displayed and then the info line shows that git has failed:
 Running C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git.exe commit -- Only whitespace and/or comments; message not saved Diffing changes to be committed (C-g to abort diffing) Type C-c C-c to finish, C-c C-k to cancel, and M-p and M-n to recover older messages [2 times] error in process sentinel: with-editor-kill-buffer-noop: Don’t kill this buffer #. Instead cancel using C-c C-k error in process sentinel: Don’t kill this buffer #. Instead cancel using C-c C-k Git failed ... [Hit $ to see buffer magit-process: XXXXXXXXXXXXX for details] 
 The magit-process buffer shows nothing useful:
  1 git.exe … &quot;commit&quot; &quot;--&quot; 
 I&#x27;ve tried restarting emacs multiple times, no change.
 I was committing happily yesterday so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.
 Has anyone else experienced this?

                              <span>I already filed a ticket with the MacPorts tree-sitter-rust port (https://trac.macports.org/ticket/69548), but I was wondering if anyone else here has a similar setup and either doesn&#x27;t experience this or has found the root cause of the issue.
 I saw a similar post about MacPorts, and python-ts-mode here: https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1848h8w/enabling_pythonts_mod%C4%99_causes_my_emacs_memory/
 The author there said that they ended up compiling everything from scratch and it worked correctly, so there must be an issue with the MacPorts builds specifically. 
 Does anyone here have any guesses or insights?
 It&#x27;s very easy to reproduce:
  
Install emacs or emacs-app from MacPorts, with no fancy flags or anything: port install emacs-app
 Launch emacs with default init: emacs -q
 Open a brand new rust buffer: C-x C-f test.rs
 Switch to rust-ts-mode: M-x rust-ts-mode
 Watch Emacs process go unresponsive with CPU pegged to 100% and memory climbing to infinity.
  
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s incorrect to manually switch to rust-ts-mode without any configuration, but if that&#x27;s not the proper way to do it, the issue still occurs with an init.el that just installs the rust-mode package, and sets (setq rust-mode-treesitter-derive t). It also happens if you don&#x27;t use that variable and instead use the more generic (setq major-mode-remap-alist &#x27;(rust-mode . rust-ts-mode)).

                              <span>Does there exist documents or videos or other resources to help migrate from Vim? 
  
What I want: 
 basic movement and edit, 
 option setting, 
 key bind setting, 
 autocmd (hook in Emacs?) setting, 
 command define, 
 basic Emacs lisp coding style.
 
 What I don&#x27;t want: 
 Evil or other emulation of vim. I will stick with native Emacs key bind.
 I hope there are not so many packages recommended. They are useful, but I want to learn more basics before using packages. So, recommend just some basic packages.
 
  
Thank you guys!

                              <span>I&#x27;m still very new to emacs, and am taking one Redditor&#x27;s advice of just living in it for 6 months or so to get it, instead of procrastinating until I&#x27;ve gone through all the &quot;right&quot; tutorials and such. I like the approach, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot - I&#x27;m at the stage where C-s no longer means &quot;save&quot; but &quot;search,&quot; and sometimes when I try to paste something outside of emacs, I get confused for a second when C-y doesn&#x27;t work. But I&#x27;m reluctant to make changes to my config file yet - when I have the time to look into that stuff properly, I want a vanilla setup, so I know I can follow any tutorial without worrying about one thing maybe breaking another, or whatever. 
 With that in mind, I want to go through Euclid in org-mode. Ideally, I&#x27;d be writing proofs, working through problems, and drawing &amp; colouring diagrams that would directly show up in my file, not have to be compiled into a LaTeX pdf or whatever. If that&#x27;s too high a bar, let me know what I can reasonably expect.

                              <span>I use typescript-ts-mode with no additional configuration. My entire configuration is practically:  (add-hook &#x27;typescript-ts-base-mode-hook (lambda () (lsp))) 
 I am mostly happy with it. The one issue that bothers me a lot is when I type:  function foo() { &lt;--- ENTER __ &lt;--- That&#x27;s two spaces! 
 But when I call indent-region it turns the two spaces into four.
 How do I make this consistent?

I was just wondering if anyone here has managed to achieve an Emacs config with similar integration to other apps (i.e. Twitter, OneNote, email, etc.).

                              <span>Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is paramount for any industry-quality usage. Without proper evaluation we end up in the world of “it works on my machine”.
In the realm of AI, this would be called “it works on my questions”.
Whether you are an engineer seeking to refine your RAG systems, are just intrigued by the nuances of RAG evaluation or are eager to read more after the first part of the series (Evaluating retrieval in RAGs: a gentle introduction) — you are in the right place.
This article equips you with the knowledge needed to navigate evaluation in RAGs and the framework to systematically compare and contrast existing evaluation libraries. This framework covers benchmark creation, evaluation metrics, parameter space and experiment tracking.

                              <span>I have a custom tree-sitter grammar for a language called &quot;core&quot; and would like to use it for syntax highlighting in emacs. I&#x27;ve tested and highlighted works from the command line using tree-sitter highlight. I have not found clear instructions yet on how to do this. All posts refer to grammars for other existing languages.

 (require &#x27;tree-sitter-langs) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Few comments:
 cc and c++ paths are specified because emacs is installed via snap and needs to use gcc instead of system-installed clang to compile shared library. It was a problem which I fixed.
 (treesit-ready-p &#x27;core) returns t.
 When opening .core file and using tree-sitter-hl-mode command, I get:
 &quot;No language registered for major mode ‘core-ts-mode’&quot; error.
 Indeed tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist does not mention &quot;core&quot;.
 What I am doing wrong?

                              <span>When I launch emacs with --init-directory&#x3D;C:\SomeDirectory in Windows Emacs still uses the .emacs file under the AppData\Roaming directory.
 Isn&#x27;t the purpose if --init-directory to avoid this all together, and look for or create .emacs in the --init-directory?
 I take it that --init-directory is the equivalent of .emacs.d.
 Do .emacs and init.el have to be explicitly set on the command line invocation if they shouldn&#x27;t be the defaults?

 I switched back to lsp-mode from lsp-bridge because I missed xref and helm, and those are still good reasons to use lsp-mode. But I&#x27;ve switched back to lsp-bridge, and I think it may be for a long time. And I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll write an update every time here--I mean, maybe I need a blog or something if I really think that might happen--but I thought this was relevant to anyone who saw the last post.
 lsp-bridge is just faster. Straight up, no questions, it&#x27;s faster. I was seeing multi-second stalls in lsp-mode again, and it&#x27;s worth pointing out again that this isn&#x27;t a problem with lsp-mode per se, this is emacs&#x27; problem. It&#x27;…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I have posted a few times on the topic of dynamic keymaps in emacs. As per some suggestions on my previous posts and other sources, I wrote a minor mode to house all of my leader keybindings. However, the :filter property on menu-items is actually called ONCE when the keymap is evaluated and never again. This behavior seems to diverge from examples I have seen. Does anyone know how to fix this? Maybe I am doing something wrong.
 As soon as I start emacs I see the message &quot;filtering!&quot; then &quot;Going to use regular code keymap&quot;. Then whenever I do &quot;C-SPC c&quot; I always get the default keymap and I don&#x27;t see any more messages printed from my filter function.

                              <span>I have a workflow these days that takes advantage of file-local variables. I recognize them as a potential code-injection vector and appreciate that emacs provides interlocks (like &#x60;enable-local-variables&#x60; and &#x60;safe-local-variable-values&#x60;) to customize the level of scrutiny they receive before emacs evaluates them.
 One option that I can&#x27;t find that would be nice-to-have would be to tell emacs &quot;all file-local variables for all buffers with default-directory set to this directory are safe; apply regular scrutiny rules to any others.&quot; This should be safe for my workflow as I control all paths to new buffers spawning with default-directory set to my safe directory.
 I don&#x27;t see an obvious way to enable that; is that a feature I haven&#x27;t found in the docs, or is there a clever way to cobble it together?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve install the multiple cursors plugin, and have it set up like so:
 (use-package multiple-cursors :ensure t :bind (&quot;C-.&quot; . mc/edit-lines) (&quot;C-j&quot; . mc/mark-next-like-this-word)) 
 This mostly works, but it some modes override this keybinding. For example, in the scratch buffer, I see that C-j is bound to eval-print-last-sexp and in tex files, it&#x27;s bound to reindent-then-newline-and-indent.
 I have a few questions: 1) How I can make my mapping take precedence across all modes (but still have C-j work as normal in other mappings, e.g. C-x C-j for dired jump and 2) How can I override my mapping for a specific list of modes (e.g. in tex-mode, use the multiple cursors mapping, but in scratch buffers use eval-print-last-sexp instead.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, is it possible to configure orderless completion style so that when I have two candidates:
 foo/bar/baz foo/bar/foo 
 a prompt &quot;foo foo&quot; would match only the second candidate?
 Or is there some simple modification to the &quot;foo foo&quot; prompt that would do this?
 Bonus question - how to still match only the foo/bar/foo candidate if there is another candidate foo/bar/foo/baz/foo? In other words: how to match candidates with exact number of occurences of foo?

                              <span>I was wondering if there is a way to configure either recentf-mode or consult to search for a file in the directories of recently opened files for the file you are looking to work on. As an example, I recently opened /path/foo, and now I want to open file bar which is also in /path but has not recently been opened so recentf-mode knows nothing about it. I would like consult-buffer to be able to check for bar in any of the paths to recently opened files before failing the search. Is there something in either of those packages today that would do this that I am missing in the documentation? If not would this be a feature others would make use of?

I tried slime-company, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me (its just don&#x27;t show errors, available completion and etc). Maybe there is some lsp for lisp?

                              <span>Heya friends,
 I thought the following would Just Work™️:
 (with-eval-after-load &quot;embark&quot; (with-eval-after-load &quot;eglot&quot; (defvar-keymap embark-eglot-map :doc &quot;Keymap for Embark Eglot/LSP actions.&quot; &quot;r&quot; #&#x27;eglot-rename) (define-key embark-identifier-map (kbd &quot;C-l&quot;) embark-eglot-map) )) 
 I can trigger the function just fine -- go to a variable, then C-, for embark-act, then C-l r and boom.
 Thing is: M-x eglot-rename interactively asks for a new name in the minibuffer.
 Invoking this function via Embark does not prompt for a new name and instead finishes right away. So I can&#x27;t effectively rename anything this way. (Confusingly, running that command on $myVar immediately finished and changes occurrences to $$myVar :))
 For context, this is the start of eglot-rename:
 (defun eglot-rename (newname) &quot;Rename the current symbol to NEWNAME.&quot; (interactive (list (read-from-minibuffer (format &quot;Rename &#x60;%s&#x27; to: &quot; (or (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol t) &quot;unknown symbol&quot;)) nil nil nil nil (symbol-name (symbol-at-point))))) ...) 
 Does Embark do anything automatically when calling functions that I could be missing?
 Is there a term for this phenomenon to search for?

                              <span>I do both. It depends on where I am and how I invoke Emacs. In my case, I sit 95 percent of the time on the Emacs terminal version, i.e., the Emacs client running on the terminal, which suits my mundane and trivial workflow. 
 Now, if I want to see pdf while sitting in that mode, I have to take advantage of the proper pdf viewer in the system(that is how I figured and used to) . W
 While on GUI mode, you could do so inside it with pdf-tool or docview(previously).
 Now, the query is: 
 What do you prefer? And why?

                              <span>Hello guys. I have some org-capture templates, some of them are intended to store meeting entries for clocking purposes and note taking. I’ve been having issues with my flow, because I tend to start by: “I had some things to debate here, let me go to my notes”. I mean, I’m already calling a template. How do you guys store your agenda for recurring meetings? How do for any other kind of similar flows? (e.g. I’m thinking about a meeting with a particular team and that topic you were willing to debate with them whenever there’s a chance).

                              <span>I&#x27;m learning to use tikz and the lines below help me render the images inline but I just can&#x27;t figure out how to add &quot;\usetikzlibrary{intersections}&quot; to this.
 (add-to-list &#x27;org-latex-packages-alist &#x27;(&quot;&quot; &quot;tikz&quot; t)) 
 (eval-after-load &quot;preview&quot; &#x27;(add-to-list &#x27;preview-default-preamble &quot;\PreviewEnvironment{tikzpicture}&quot; t)) (setq org-latex-create-formula-image-program &#x27;imagemagick)
 How can I go about this? I tried using this (see last line)
 (setq org-preview-latex-default-process &#x27;my:dvipng) (add-to-list &#x27;org-preview-latex-process-alist &#x27;(my:dvipng :programs (&quot;latex&quot; &quot;dvipng&quot;) :description &quot;dvi &gt; png&quot; :message &quot;you need to install the programs: latex and dvipng.&quot; :image-input-type &quot;dvi&quot; :image-output-type &quot;png&quot; :image-size-adjust (1.0 . 1.0) :latex-compiler (&quot;latex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f&quot;) :image-converter (&quot;dvipng -D %D -T tight -o %O %f&quot;) :transparent-image-converter (&quot;dvipng -D %D -T tight -bg Transparent -o %O %f&quot;) :latex-header (&quot;\usepackage{tikz}&quot; &quot;\usetikzlibrary{intersections}&quot;))) 
 But that doesn&#x27;t seem to work. It complains that I have given wrong type argument for :latex-header and the description says it expects a list of strings but that&#x27;s what I seem to have given it. Now I&#x27;m quite lost. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s something simple, but suddenly when I ask the REPL 1 + 1 I now get the answer 2, but only after a big warning about something:
 :2:1-5: warning: [-Wtype-defaults] • Defaulting the type variable ‘a0’ to type ‘Integer’ in the following constraints (Show a0) arising from a use of ‘print’ at :2:1-5 (Num a0) arising from a use of ‘it’ at :2:1-5 • In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it 2 
 What is this saying and how can I avoid it?

                              <span>So I’m going insane trying to solve this problem. No imports allowed and none of the usual functions which would assist like map, zip, fold etc. (however could be built manually). 
 The function takes a list and outputs the most occurring element. Eq [a] &#x3D;&gt; [a] -&gt; a
 To assist with this, my thinking is to create a helper function which would take a list and output a list of tuples [a] -&gt; [(a, Int)]. The output effectively being a dictionary which would give me the frequency of each element. 
 This wouldn’t be too hard for me in Python, however, the functional paradigm is really tripping me out and I can’t build this “dictionary” whatever I do. 
 Any help much appreciated! Thanks

                              <span>Apologies for the super newbie question below--I&#x27;m just now exploring Haskell. If there&#x27;s a more appropriate place for asking questions like this, please let me know.
 I&#x27;m very inexperienced with statically typed language (haven&#x27;t used one in years), but I work in a research lab where we use Clojure, and as a thought experiment, I&#x27;m trying to work out how our core Clojure system would be implemented in Haskell. The key challenge seems to be that Haskell doesn&#x27;t allow polymorphic lists--or I saw someone call them heterogeneous lists?--with more than one concrete type. That&#x27;s gonna cause a big problem for me, unless I&#x27;m missing something.
 So we have this set of &quot;components.&quot; These are clojure objects that all have the same core functions defined on them (like a haskell typeclass), but they all do something different. Essentially, they each take in as input a list of elements, and then produce as output a new list of elements. These elements, like the components, are heterogeneous. They&#x27;re implemented as Clojure hashmaps that essentially map from a keyword to anything. They could be implemented statically as records, but there would be many different records, and they&#x27;d all need to go into the same list (or set).
 So that&#x27;s the challenge. We have a heterogenous set of components that we&#x27;d want to represent in a single list/set, and these produce a hetereogeneous set of elements that we&#x27;d want to represent in a single list/set. There might be maybe 30-40 of each of these, so representing every component in a single disjunctive data type doesn&#x27;t seem feasible.
 Does that question make sense? I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a reasonable solution in Haskell that I&#x27;m missing. Thanks.

                              <span>I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes a year ago. Since then I always want to have a systematic study on how to prevent complications, plan my diet and exercises.
I just need to figure out where to begin all this.
My current plan is to use the DK&#x27;s Diabete&#x27;s Handbook as a lead-in, which I hope could give me a systematic overview, and then I plan to add more articles and books to each part of the topic.
Then I start my plan last week by reading the handbook,  but I notice I have no idea how to read a book. I admit it indeed sounds silly. I was a good student when I was in the college. Now I&#x27;m not. I don&#x27;t know what to do when I go through each line, paragraph on the page.
So I&#x27;m wondering if anyone could share a realistic approach to read a book/books/article. By realistic, I mean I really hope it&#x27;s not some theory education with really confused vocabularies. Think me like a 12 year old student, not some top scientists.
Thank you and wish you all well.</span>

                              <span>Right now I have company bound to a keybinding and rather than having it drop down with a box filled with possible candidates my completions show up inline and I can cycle through them with C-n or C-p. Its the company preview front-end. I&#x27;d like to move to corfu since I am already using orderless. Does anybody know if corfu does this and would it be possible to have a corfu offer both a tooltip front-end and a preview front end that I can bind to different keys and use as I chose.

 I have this in my config:
  (general-evil-define-key &#x27;(normal) org-mode-map &quot;DEL&quot; &#x27;mh/del &quot;C-DEL&quot; &#x27;mh/del ) 
 And the first binding works, however the second (the one I actually want) does not.
 What could the problem be here?

                              <span>I usually use Emacs for writing and editing and organizing, but seldom do I program anything with Emacs.
 That changed a bit in recent weeks. To my surprise I found that binding RET to default-indent-new-line was surprisingly useful, because it automatically continues block comment asterisks in C-style languages.
 The default key binding is M-j to continue comment blocks in a somewhat DWIM way. So with the point at the end of the comment line:
 /** * Writing here.‸ */ 
 You get 
 /** * Writing here. * ‸ */ 
 I bound this to RET (which was newline) and so far haven&#x27;t found any problems with it.
 I&#x27;m also pretty sure I&#x27;ve never seen anyone do this stupid rebind, so what are you all using instead?

 Search for &quot;foo bar&quot; to match &quot;foo blah bar&quot; and also &quot;bar blah foo&quot;; can escape by searching for &quot;foo\ bar&quot; to find precisely &quot;foo bar&quot; however.
 The very first cut hack repo is here: https://github.com/skeezix/isearch-out-of-order
 I use out of order search every day, for half remembered function names etc; super handy. I&#x27;ve gotten by with swiper tweaked to look like isearch but wanted to not require the whole ivy stack, and I…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am new to elisp. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d be glad if some of you could help me out.
 What I want to achieve
 I want to enable hl-line-mode and display-line-number-mode in all current and future buffers derived from prog-mode, text-mode, conf-mode and dired-mode. I also want to be able to toggle this functionality. By default I want this to be turned off. I just want to enable this from time to time.
 I&#x27;ll outline the high level way I thought about achieving this.
 Adding functionality
  
Add mode hooks to enable functionality in future buffers. (1)
 Apply buffer-local minor mode functions to all buffers derived from specific modes. (2)
  
Removing functionality
  
Remove mode hooks such that future buffers don&#x27;t have it. (3)
 Apply buffer-local minor mode functions to all buffers derived from specfic modes to toggle/disable functionality activated in step 2 above. This step might the same as step 2 above because hl-line-mode and display-line-number-mode provide toggling. (4)
  
I know how to add and remove hooks but I don&#x27;t know how implement steps 2 and 4. Especially checking whether buffers are in a mode derived from a specific major mode or not.
 I&#x27;d be really happy to receive some help on how to go about it.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Some URIs can contain URI fragments, e.g. foo.bar/baz#locator where locator is the fragment. See RFC 5147. Is there a way to reliably handle these in emacs?
 Here&#x27;s my usecase: I use ebib, which lets me store a PDF filepath in a bibtex entry, then open the file at the filepath with a command when I&#x27;m viewing that entry. One problem with this is that often (in my discipline at least) the bibtex entry doesn&#x27;t relate to a file, it relates to some part of a file (e.g. where the entry is for a paper published in a collection, and my file is a PDF of the whole collection). The obvious way to get around this is to store a URI with a fragment in the bibtex file field (e.g. path/to/my.pdf#page&#x3D;210 for a paper which starts on page 210 of the collection). 
 However, as far as I can tell, emacs doesn&#x27;t support using URI fragments in finding files. Am I right/wrong? Is there a good known solution?
 To be clear, I know I could write a custom file handler function for ebib specifically, but that seems a bit too specific. I&#x27;d rather have a general way of handling this, so that ebib doesn&#x27;t have to do anything unusual. That way, other applications which deal with the same cases (e.g. citar, in the case above) will inherit the same functionality.
 TIA!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use cdlatex, but corfu interferes with the common completions. I don&#x27;t want to lose corfu, and, while using C-g before TAB works, it&#x27;s slower. Is there a capf fore cdlatex or something like that? I found there is a company backend on the issues of cdlatex, so I suppose is doable (if there isn&#x27;t any I&#x27;ll try do it myself, but I&#x27;ve already got a big list).
 Thanks

                              <span>Say I have this org doc:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org * Some Header
 +BEGIN_SRC sql
 Select * from ;
 +END_SRC
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is there a way to substitute  with a file variable or property when tangling/exporting the code block?
 I&#x27;ve tried: org :PROPERTIES: :header-args:sql: :var tableName&#x3D;someTable :END: 
 But it doesn&#x27;t appear that sql blocks support &#x27;var&#x27;.
 I&#x27;ve tried: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;org
 Local variables:
 tableName: someTable
 End:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 But local variables only seem to work if the code block is of type emacs-lisp.
 So, is there some way to set file variables to be used for string replacements in org code blocks?

                              <span>I want a function like org-get-tags that will list not only local and inherited tags, but also group tags. Is there such a thing?
 To illustrate what I want, suppose I have the following in an org-mode buffer: 
 #+tags: [ group : {_.+} ] * This is a test :_test: ** This is another 
 Calling org-get-tags on the second headline (&quot;This is another&quot;) yields a list which includes the inherited tag _test (here we have org-use-tag-inheritance set to t, which is I believe the default). But it doesn&#x27;t include the group tag group. The same happens if I call org-get-tags on the first headline: I just get (&quot;_test&quot;) as a result. I&#x27;m looking for a way of getting all the tags, including group tags.
 I tried going over the definition of org-tags-view but I couldn&#x27;t really follow.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I was playing with generating Core for simple definitions and noticed that GHC omits type applications for tuples. Here&#x27;s an example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; module Foo where f :: a -&gt; [a] f x &#x3D; [x]
 g :: a -&gt; (a,a) g x &#x3D; (x,x) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 And here is the generated Core: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ghc -c -O0 -ddump-simpl Foo.hs .... f :: forall a. a -&gt; [a] [GblId, Arity&#x3D;1, Unf&#x3D;OtherCon []] f &#x3D; \ (@a_aAC) (x_ag4 :: a_aAC) -&gt; GHC.Types.: @a_aAC x_ag4 (GHC.Types.[] @a_aAC) -- ^ ^ -- type application for list constructors
 g :: forall a. a -&gt; (a, a) [GblId, Arity&#x3D;1, Unf&#x3D;OtherCon []] g &#x3D; \ (@a_aAA) (x_ag5 :: a_aAA) -&gt; (x_ag5, x_ag5) --- ^ --- no type applications &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Is this just pretty-printing or is there something else going on?

                              <span>Hey all,
 We&#x27;ve been using persistent at work for a new project and it&#x27;s been serving us well.
 To run db queries, we&#x27;ve introduced a runDb function which is SqlPersistT m a -&gt; m a, implemented using runSqlPool.
 A standard &quot;business logic&quot; function looks like this RunDb m &#x3D;&gt; m Something and it uses runDb internally.
 Larger business logic pieces are composed of multiple of these functions.
 The code looks good, but we&#x27;ve noticed the following (probably obvious) problem:
 The following piece of code will run 3 transactions, because each &quot;business logic&quot; piece uses runDb internally:
 something &lt;- getSomething anotherThing &lt;- getAnotherThing processSomethingAndPersist something anotherThing 
 We&#x27;re ending up with hundreds of transactions for more complicated pieces of business logic, which is a bit excessive.
 We looked at persistent-mtl but could not get it to compile due to some weird GHC error (solveWanteds: too many iterations (limit &#x3D; 10)). However, after examining the code, it will still run separate transactions unless you call withTransaction and run everything in TransactionM.
 I thought about using some thread local state to store the current SqlBackend and use that if it&#x27;s available, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right approach.
 How is this generally handled? We just want to have a single transaction per request, ideally with the ability to commit it and/or start a new one.

                              <span>Currently I&#x27;m reading the fpinscala book and while doing the exercises escpecially in the laziness and parallel chapters I stumbled into accidental issues like unwanted eager evaluation, non-terminating evaluation, dead-locking or not properly utilised threads. To deal with these issues I threw a bunch of println statements into the code. I&#x27;m wondering if is there any other way to test lazy or parallel code?

                              <span>A new version of Helenus was released in February. I took me some time after some holidays to publish the release on GitHub. Hopefully we can smooth the release process, specially the notes, with conventional commits.

Is there any way that I can adapt the toggling of prettification of org headings while using a package like org modern, using a similar idea? Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all! I noticed that sometimes the emacs process will emergency escape when I click C-g too many times on a completion prompt. How would one go about disabling this? Usually it happens when using Mu4e and switching inboxes but i don&#x27;t trigger it consistently There is no prompt to confirm before exiting. The stdout of emacs reports that the emergency escape key was pressed. I don&#x27;t have the output saved atm.
 Note: I run emacs on my tablet using termux. Phantom process limit is disabled on android. Its emacs killing itself
 Thank you, Quezta3

                              <span>I am very, Very, VERY happy to learn that I can sort the emacs buffers that contain notmuch search results!!!
 E.g. in buffer &quot;notmuch-saved-search-all mail&quot; esc-X read-only-mode toggles to make the buffer writeable and then C-x esc esc ... (sort-fields 3 (point-min) (point-max)) to sort the lines by the 3rd field, the from: address (mostly - I haven&#x27;t yet fixed the date+time formatting to be consistent).
 Hallelujah! I turned away from notmuch years ago because I thought it might have the &quot;search, don&#x27;t sort&quot; philosophy of gmail. Happily not. 
 Before I spend too much time writing my own sort, has anyone else already written them (and I just didn&#x27;t find them by searching the notmuch docs and web)?
 The usual sort by Sender, Recipient, Subject, status, dates, other headers... 
 Simple sorts should easy, once I figure out how to sort by the plist properties associated with each line of the buffers.
 I hope that somebody has already written grouped sorts - e.g. sort by the count of unread messages grouped by sender, etc. Shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, except makes the buffers no longer simple lists of lines - want 1 line per group sorted by counts, unfolding to message/thread lists.

                              <span>According to https://github.com/hlissner/evil-snipe#integration-into-avyevil-easymotion it is possible to integrate evil-snipe with avy or evil-motion. I am not sure what that means but from the title of that issue and the first message [Edit: this issue and first message https://github.com/hlissner/evil-snipe/issues/25#issuecomment-208068419 ], I am thinking it might mean adding labels to evil-snipe after the first result like the neovim extension leap.nvim.
 However, copy pasting that into my config.el for doom emacs results in an error, evaluting it directly does not seem to do anything.
 Why:
 The difference with just doing avy-goto-char-2 is that leap.nvim jumps directly to the first match wherease avy-goto-char-2 requires using a label to go to the first match. I would like to avoid using labels as much as possible as they can distracting.

 I&#x27;m working on a project that no longer uses github issues. We still have some old issues but they&#x27;re all closed.
 Is there a way to disable forge from fetching issues completely? Or filtering so it only fetches open issues?
 Thanks

(There were a few stragglers who were coming from mode-line instead) . I thought perhaps I&#x27;d do a PR if others agreed with me. 4 fours later someone had already fixed it.

                              <span>I have recently fallen down the rabbit whole of trying to get a jupyter notebook-esque workflow in emacs. I used ein for a few years, but it&#x27;s been unreliable enough for me to look for new solutions. Many people seem to be using org-babel source blocks to reproduce this workflow. I started to tinker with this setup when I noticed eglot wasn&#x27;t working in my source blocks. Even if I C-c &#x27;, eglot still doesn&#x27;t work in the buffer that opens up (even though it&#x27;s in Python mode). Am I missing something? Is eglot supposed to be working here?

                              <span>A few weeks back someone showed me a new examples-based documentation system in Emacs. We were discussing proper usage of some elisp functions. For the life of me, I cannot remember the name of that docs subsystem. I cannot recall if it went in in 28.x or 29.x. Search engines and LLMs don&#x27;t know either.
 Anyone here can assist?
 EDIT: shortdocs!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to use eshell as my main shell and have encountered a situation I have no idea how to solve. I see two ways to use sudo in eshell. One is invoking sudo directly, which requires entering my password each time I use it. The other is using tramp; if I try to use it, then in order to terminate the ability to use sudo without a password, I need to terminate the created tramp sudo connection. I could probably solve it by closing such a connection automatically after a certain period, but I can&#x27;t even find a function that lists all active tramp connections. I saw a discussion on the internet suggesting:
 (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)
 (setq password-cache t)
 (setq password-cache-expiry 10)
 But it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my case.There&#x27;s a command called &#x27;tramp-cleanup-connection&#x27;. If I use it on a buffer where I opened a sudo connection, I see something like &#x27;/sudo:root@archlinux:&#x27;, and choosing this connection to close doesn&#x27;t do anything. Only using &#x27;tramp-cleanup-all-connections&#x27; closes it, obviously.
 My apologies for any technical inaccuracies, i&#x27;m not even an emacs user (yet).

https://xenodium.com/further-sqlite-mode-extensions
 
https://xenodium.com/sqlite-mode-goodies
 
 Since then, folks have reached out requesting either upstreaming or pushing to MELPA.
 While I can&#x27;t commit to upstreaming at this point, I can meet halfway on MELPA.
 As of yesterday, it&#x27;s available there: https://melpa.org/#/sqlite-mode-extras
 While I haven&#x27;t heard of issues, please continue treating as experimental and exercise safety by backing up your data.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not talking about emacsserver here, something completely different. This may be a heretical idea, but I want to see where it goes. I have an idea for a note-taking program that&#x27;s as nice-looking, performant and friendly as logseq or obsidian, but is fully backed by emacs and org-mode. I need features like tags, transclusion and backlinks, but also want all of Emacs: keyboard macros, eval&#x27;ed source blocks, LSP mode, etc. -- but over it all I want a smooth modern UI. I know some folks here will tell me how it&#x27;s possible in emacs; believe me, I&#x27;ve looked into the options for some years now (org-roam, org-logseq, org-transclusion, org-roam-ui and more) and the ones I&#x27;ve seen are slow or fragile or never bore fruit, so just bear with me and see if we can explore this idea.
 What I&#x27;d like is to run emacs in a headless way and sync, in realtime, a set of buffers to a modern UI (maybe electron, who knows). Let&#x27;s say we have a page in the UI, composed of a set of buffers (a buffer per block, maybe with sub-&quot;buffers&quot; transcluded into the UI), and the UI knows which emacs buffer corresponds to each block of text. My idea is the UI forwards keyboard &amp; mouse events to emacs and receives buffer updates (including text props &amp; overlays etc.), which it then displays in an integrated nice way. Could such a thing even be done? I don&#x27;t want to scrape the emacs pixels -- I want to &quot;export&quot; the meaningful contents of the buffer for display over a socket protocol. Text, properties, overlays, images, etc. with their semantics. 
 It seems like such a thing could be useful for other purposes as well, like using emacs to edit any text field in any app. Possibly even emacs could then run as an http service as the back end of a web app to run on Android or iOS. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the first to think of doing this; has anyone tried it before? What was learned?

                              <span>I know this is probably a problem more related to flatpak itself, but I&#x27;d no use it if my GNU/Linux distro would make it available on its repositories.
 I am using org-mode with LaTeX snippets inside for my notes, but Emacs cannot find LaTeX in the system. LaTeX is installed, so I think it&#x27;s just a matter of allowing Emacs to access the host binaries outside the container.
 My questions are:
  
what&#x27;s the best strategy to allow Emacs to access LaTeX? A separate flatpak? A special run option?
 Emacs 29 is great for its integration with org-roam How you installed it on your machjne? and this is why I want this version on my system. How you install Emacs29 on your distro? Is that updated?
  
Thanks for your attention and patience.

                              <span>After many experiments and hacks, dired-auto-readme is now available via Melpa and I think relatively safe to use.
 For Markdown preview, you will need to install Markdown mode. Rst and Org modes are already built-in into Emacs and work out of the box.
 Unfortunately, I had to raise the bar to Emacs 29.1 version. The reason is that Org-mode implements some new features that make this package substantially easier to implement and require less ugly hacks I used to use in the past. I think it is also a bit more efficient with the new org-fold.
 Not everything is perfect, some links will not be beautified; it works mostly in org-mode, but it is what it is - in the end of the day, still a hack. Hope you enjoy it anyway!

                              <span>In my project (Python and JavaScript), there are some functions that will accept a string as an input but only some specific ones are allowed. These are stored in a database. It would be really helpful if I had some kind of hint/suggestion as I&#x27;m typing it. So for example, if I write something like (Python):
  
self.get_document(&quot;
  
I want it to suggest from a list of strings after it fetches from the database. In other cases, I may also have some json files in the project which it needs to look through. I&#x27;m not sure if what I need should be implemented as an external LSP or something in Emacs itself. It would also be great if it can show an error if the string is invalid (which would otherwise be valid Python/JS).
 Will I need to write this from scratch or is there something already out there that I can use to build upon? I&#x27;ve just started using Emacs 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m excited to explore how I can use its power to simplify my workflow. Any advice to push me in that direction is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to record a file&#x27;s creation timestamp not as part of the filename but as a property.
 So I am trying to create a capture template that does that but I am struggeling to insert the proper time.
 This is what i have so far:
 (setq org-roam-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; plain &quot;%?&quot; :if-new (file+head &quot;${slug}.org&quot; &quot;:PROPERTIES: :CREATED: [%&lt;%Y%m%d%H%M%S] :END: #+title: ${title}\n&quot;) :unnarrowed t))) 
 So my question is how do I get the current time inserted as property - can I do that with a capture template or do I need a trigger?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>TL;DR
 When using a time-prompted datetree capture -- i.e. one using file+olp+datetree and :time-prompt t -- how do I get my hands on the current date and time (i.e. the date and time when the capture is performed) and in a form I can use as an org timestamp (both active and inactive)?
 Details
 By default, a capture template using file+olp+datetree will store the captured entry in the datetree on the date of capture -- i.e. usually, in practice, today&#x27;s date. And that date is also made available in the various date/time-related %-escapes -- %U, %T, etc -- so as well as the item being located in the datetree according to that date, you can also insert the date into the content of the entry in various ways.
 However, if the capture template is given a :time-prompt t property then you are pr…</span>

                              <span>Lean 4 has a very cool feature that allows monadic do-blocks to contain imperative loops and mutable variables. This paper provides the motivation and theoretical underpinning.
 Since the concept is portable to any purely functional language supporting monad transformers, I thought it would be a fun experiment to implement it as a GHC plugin. The resulting plugin, donuts, allows for writing imperative style code such as this:
 guessPass :: IO Bool guessPass &#x3D; do let Mut guesses &#x3D; [] let Mut n &#x3D; 1 :: Int whileL (n  show n input  intercalate &quot;, &quot; guesses pure False 
 which the plugin desugars to monad transformer applications: ExceptT for control flow and StateT for mutable variables. Note that this works for any monadic do-block, not just IO.
 The imperativity is local in the sense that mutable variables are only mutable within the confines of the enclosing do-block&#x27;s body statements as well as the bodies of loops occurring in that block. Similar restrictions apply for control flow commands such as earlyReturn, breakL, and continueL.

 For example, an example I have was Chris Okasaki&#x27;s thesis - reading about his complexity arguments was a new way of thinking I hadn&#x27;t thought about before w.r.t. analysis of algorithms. Although I don&#x27;t know if you would consider that &quot;functional programming&quot; really. 
 I&#x27;m not too intricate with functional programming so I&#x27;m not sure if this is even a well formed question, but hopefully my point makes sense.

                              <span>When it was released, Scala 3 removed Scala 2&#x27;s runtime reflection capability replacing it with a compile-time macro-based reflection facility. While powerful, this new macro-based reflection exposes a lot of compiler internals and &quot;isms&quot; to the user, which is not always easy to understand or navigate. 
 The scala-reflection library does the hard work of reflecting on a class at compile-time for you. It then exposes the details of a reflected class as an RType abstraction that is much easier to navigate. 
 Version 2.0.2 greatly improves reflection on Scala 2-compiled classes (eg from an external library).

                              <span>I am downloading Scala with Coursier cs setup and for some reason its taking a very long time to install the standard Scala applications. It&#x27;s been installing for about two hours but its slowly making progress once in a while. Is there anything I can do to speed up this process?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an unemployed .Net engineer with experience in F# and a functional variant of C#. I&#x27;ve been searching for a new job for nearly 8 months, but I have been unemployed for almost 13. This job market has been absolutely brutal for me. My interviewing skills have gotten much stronger, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any new tech screens for months. Just rejection after rejection. Needless to say, I&#x27;m branching out.
 F# is pretty much a no-go at this point. At any given time, it is entirely possible that there is not a single public job posting for an F# position. The positions that do pop up aren&#x27;t often particularly good ones. Even so, I apply and get rejected without a tech screen.
 I&#x27;m currently examining Scala as an option, since many companies use it as a functional language. This would be very similar to my experience using C# as a functional language, and my direct FP experience in F#.
 I&#x27;d like to know what I would have to do to successfully make that transition to Scala. Specifically, what is the minimum that I&#x27;d have to learn about Scala to talk my way in? Or, is there a way I can sell myself such that I don&#x27;t have to do any additional learning before I start a role as a Scala engineer?
 Thus far, I&#x27;ve gotten all rejections without tech screens for Scala positions just like everything else. But it&#x27;s not clear to me that the companies using Scala recognize the connection between Scala and my current F#/C# experience.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just a noob learning the wonderful way of life that is Emacs. I went from not knowing what the hell an M-x was to writing my own Elisp functions and minor modes. One thing I can&#x27;t figure out though, is how do I keep Treemacs open until I manually close it, for example when selecting a file that isn&#x27;t already open in a buffer somewhere? I checked all of the treemacs-visit-node-* functions, but they all seem to close Treemacs with a double prefix. Is there any way to change this behavior? I guess I could write my own treemacs-visit-node function, but I don&#x27;t know how to use the treemacs--execute-button-action macro. I&#x27;ll be glad for any help at all.

 If you’re considering or already using the howm package, there’s good news. Version 1.5.1 was recently launched.
 I think it&#x27;s a good time to update the manual too. The manual now includes two chapters on time management and has additional information in other sections. 
 Enjoy the new features and updates!

 I want to change that but don&#x27;t know which module brings that in?

                              <span>Yesterday night I was searching for a command to highlight a word, and could not find one. The closest I found was M-@ which went to the end of a word from where the cursor was. I had heard you could do so much customization in emacs I thought I would prowl the web and see how to do it. After some searching I found some sample functions, and I bootstrapped them into this,
 ​
 (defun highlight-word () &quot;Highlight the current word you are on.&quot; (interactive) (backward-word 1) (set-mark-command nil) (forward-word 1)) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c C-SPC&quot;) &#x27;highlight-word) 
 At least with this I can be almost anywhere in the word and I can highlight it, and then, for example, select all other occurrence. 
 ​
 After doing this I have a glimpse at what could be keybound. Just thought I would share.

 does anyboy have an idea why transparency doesn&#x27;t work? If I check the version it says:
 GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.24.33, cairo version 1.16.0
 Thx.

 So I decided to do the same and now introducing the lsp-treemacs-nerd-icons package.

 I’m relatively new to Emacs and elisp particularly, so will be glad for review and some feedback

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am a relatively new Emacs user (vanilla keybindings), but I am already starting to feel severely crippled when I have to use non-emacs keybindings.
 I do as much as I possibly can in Emacs and I love it, but I sometimes have to reach for a capable web browser.
 I tried out Nyxt, eaf-browser, qutebrowser, vimium browser extension, using Emacs/readline keybindings in GTK2/3 by setting gtk-theme-name &#x3D; &quot;Emacs&quot;.
 Current setup:
  
Firefox: I want to support a mature and well-maintained non-chromium browser. I also use a custom user.js and UBlock Origin to enhance privacy and security. Pages load very fast. Minimal strain on cpu and enhanced battery life.
 Vimium: Far from perfect, as many standard emacs keybindings like M-&gt; for (end-of-buffer), cannot be implemented. Setting ui.accelKey to 18, ui.key.chromeAccess to 0 and devtools.editor.keymap to &quot;emacs&quot; helped.
 GTK2/3: Setting gtk-theme-name &#x3D; &quot;Emacs&quot; really helps and makes editing input fields feel great. Unfortunately this won&#x27;t be supported anymore once firefox migrates from GTK3 to GTK4.
  
Maybe my standards are too high and I should just be happy with what I have.
 But so far I am not willing to give up on it, as my browsing experience is really the last puzzle piece missing to an otherwise perfect workflow.
 Alternative:
 Out of all the alternatives I like Nyxt by far the most.
 It truly supports emacs keybindings and I love the minibuffer. It is a joy to move around.
 If it only was possible to have extensions like UBlock Origin and maybe even swap out WebkitGTK in favor of Firefox&#x27;s Gecko Engine, I&#x27;d make Nyxt my daily driver immediately and never look back. It would be a dream come true.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate if some of you guys with requirements similar to mine (vanilla keys, ad-blocking, security and privacy concerns) could share their workflow.
 Although a student on a very tight budget, I&#x27;ll probably have to start donating regularly to Nyxt to keep my hopes alive.

However, the modeline seems to be somewhat problematic; here it doesn&#x27;t display icons correctly (sometimes it does) but it also just doesn&#x27;t have the same standard look that I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere. Does anyone have experience with this package? As well, does anyone know how I can get the modeline to set to a specific font, and/or change the overall buffer font?

 list &#x3D; [[1, 2, 3, 5], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]]
  
​
 The code is supposed to add +1 to the list with odd number of elements in it. The problem is that it either applies the function the all sublists or i could use empty square brackets for the otherwise case. But i dont want that. I want it to return the unchanged list if number of elements are even.
 I have tried to use xs for the otherwise case but gives an error. What am i missing here?

 Does anyone know what might cause this? Thanks for any assistance.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m a complete beginner at Emacs (running on Windows 11) and just learning how to use it, so please excuse my ignorance. I understand some of the possibilities and what it can do, but I&#x27;m struggling with even some basic tutorials and have some questions. I understand some conceptual things, like buffers/windows/frames, kill ring, etc., but I don&#x27;t really know how to start integrating Emacs into my workflow. I come from VS Code and other IDEs like it.
 I began by skimming over this tutorial and these papers (1 and 2); however, when I try and use some of the macros they don&#x27;t seem to work. For instance, if I try and use C-h r, Emacs reports &quot;C-h C-r is undefined&quot;; I don&#x27;t get why this is the case, because I am holding down the CTRL key, then pressing h, then pressing r, then releasing CTRL, but it seems like Emacs is reading 2 separate presses of CTRL?. As well, I started watching this video to get the Emacs UI to look decent, but I&#x27;m not sure how I go about making a init.el file (like where do I save it, how do I access and edit the file, etc.). I know I can use C-x C-f to find a file, but it autofills c:/Program Files/Emacs; is this normal? I thought the init.el is in ~//AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/init.el/? Do I have to type that in to go to the file?
 Thank you guys so much in advance; as well, are there any other resources that I should look at first as a beginner?

I would like to do ein:run to point to the venv folder for the python and jupyter notebook instance, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find documentation specific to this. I tried ein:run then server command: /home/user/bin/python but an error saying Jupyter server failed to start, cancelling operation appears. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried using ein:run with the followup server command: /home/user/bin/jupyter-notebook, which returns the same error. I have run the command inside the activated virtual environment command line and it opens the API through the browser. 
 I&#x27;m not able to install jupyter notebooks for the user on this machine but I can make python virtual environments.

                              <span>I use tree-sitter and c++-ts-mode. I have set it up to use the K&amp;R indentation style by customizing c-ts-mode-indent-style. The code base I work with uses namespaces a lot, the company has a coding standard where everything within a namespace should not be indented. The K&amp;R style of c++-ts-mode (or c-ts-mode) indents everything within a namespace. I have tried to figure out how to customize c++-ts-mode to not indent within a namespace, without success.
 When I look at treesit-simple-indent-rules I do not find anything that seems to relate to namespaces. To do this, I guess I would use a rule involving parent-is, but I can&#x27;t find a label for a namespace declaration.
 I have failed to find any good examples on how to customize indentation in c-ts-mode/c++-ts-mode. Any suggestions on how to proceed?

                              <span>Emacs is an amazing tool when you&#x27;re the only one using it (org-mode to jot down personal TODOs, manage your monthly budget, etc.). However, I&#x27;ve consistently run into the issue where when another person needs to interact with your work in any way, it&#x27;s a major sticking point. Examples being your beautiful literate programming spec doc needing to be edited by many teams or Google calendar being the source of truth for availability at your job. 
 Have any of you successfully bridged this gap? I want to keep using emacs but find I throw away hours of work the second another human needs to even be tangentially related to the piece.

                              <span>I struggled with the live-coding experience during online interviews, so I&#x27;ve built an extension, Chrome-Emacs, for the Chrome browser, as well as an extended fork of the Emacs package atomic-chrome.
 It focuses on bi-directional editing in online text editors and text areas from within Emacs.
 Why Upgrade:
  
Manifest V3 Support: Ensures future compatibility with Chrome. (Upcoming changes from Google will disable Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome by June 2024.)
 Text, Scroll, &amp; Selection Sync: Provides real-time text, cursor, and selection synchronization between Emacs and the browser.
 Enhanced File Management and Auto Major Mode Detection: Offers improved handling for a smoother experience, supporting features like linting and auto-completion.
 Editable Area Navigation: Quickly switch between editable fields in complex web pages with hints.
  
Compatibility Note: These enhancements are in a fork, requiring an accompanying fork of the atomic-chrome.el package for full benefits. They still work with the original package for basic functionalities, though.
 Collaboration over Competition: I admire the original atomic-chrome.el project and intend this fork as a contribution, not a replacement. My goal is to merge these improvements back into the original to benefit everyone. I also admire the original atomic-chrome extension.
 Difference from Other Extensions:
  
Vs. GhostEditor: While a fantastic tool for bidirectional editing, it lacks real-time cursor and selection sync and is still based on Manifest V2.
 Vs. Edit with Emacs: Applies changes but not in live mode and isn’t bidirectional. It also doesn’t cater to online editors, operating on Manifest V2.
  
I&#x27;m eager to hear feedback, suggestions, and welcome contributions.
 The link to the extension in the Chrome Web Store is here.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m learning Emacs and writing my own setup and I&#x27;m using the Elpaca package manager with use-package wrapper (my emacs dotfiles). Please feel free to roast my config and poke holes in it and suggest some improvements :)
 Currently I have 2 folders core/ (for emacs internal stuff) and modules/ (for packages) where core/core-init.el is sourced (required) from my init.el and it in turn sources the rest of core/ and all from modules/. Previously, what I have done for modules is that I&#x27;ve put the (elpaca-wait) command in each module, so that after each module is read elpaca processes the queue immediately and activates the package (at least that&#x27;s what I thought it did from how I understood it before).
 Since then, I&#x27;ve come to learn that elpaca processes the packages queue after reading the init file, so that made me think that it&#x27;s enough to call (elpaca-wait) only once at the end of my init.el after all the modules have been read -- which is what I did, however, now on startup I get warnings about bunch of packages that says:
  
ef-themes loaded before Elpaca activation (analogously for the others) and all of those packages are inactive and some of my settings for the font, theme, orderless, consult etc. aren&#x27;t respected.
  
Before I go ahead and refactor and fix everything, is my understanding correct that it is enough to write all package configs and then call (elpaca-wait) once at the end of my init.el for it to process and load all my package configs? If not, when should I call (elpaca-wait)?
 What is &quot;the best&quot; (a good, optimal) way of making as much use of Elpaca&#x27;s async powers as possible? Am I on the right track here?

 Every time I try to perform backward-sexp in python (with or without the shortcut) from a parenthetical at the end of a function, it will go to the start of the function, not the enclosing parenthetical.
 How do I stop it from going so far and going to the proper place?
 I am using the lsp python language server plugin but I was having this issue before I configured my emacs for python.

                              <span>Robe is a Ruby code assistance package.
 This is mostly to tag the changes that have been in the snapshot builds for the last few years, but also to announce that the next release should have more breakage (it should require Ruby 2.3+).
 And compared to the last release tag, this one has:
  
Ruby 3 compatibility.
 Emacs 28 and 29 compatibility fixes.
 Print &quot;keyrest&quot; params correctly in hints. Same for &quot;triple dot&quot; notation.
 company-robe shows icons for completions.
 Jumping to methods in classes which only have private methods.
 Jumping to methods referenced by symbol.
 File names printed (in the doc buffer) relative to the load path.
 Tracking of variable types after assignment (for improved completion). The implementation is still regexp-based.
 Likewise for calls where the target is a literal (string, hash, array).
 Less blinking with eldoc and documentation display.
 Navigation and completion for RSpec bindings (also regexp-based).
 The &quot;jump to constant&quot; call now works with BSD Grep too (Grep search is used as a fallback).
 New option robe-show-doc-source.
 Highlighting comments as comments in the doc buffer.
 More robust constant completion.
 Other tweaks and fixes.

                              <span>My goal is to iterate over a Map that contains several thousand records, and compare each matching key, with a column name from a Dataframe that has a hundreds of columns.
 I have a Dataframe that has a subset of objects:
 val petDF &#x3D; Seq(
 (1, “dog”),
 (2, “cat”),
 (3, &quot;horse&quot;)
 ).toDF(“Rank”, “Animal”,
 ….several hundred columns)
 ​
 And a map or dictionary with key/value pairs that has a superset of objects.
 val lookupMap &#x3D; Map (
 “Rank” -&gt; “Rating”,
 “Animal” -&gt; “Pet”,
 “Human” -&gt; “Person”,
 “Neighbor” -&gt; “Friend”
 …several thousand records…
 )
 ​
 I need to iterate over the Map and for each match with the Dataframe column, I need to reassign the column name in the Dataframe depending whenever there is a match on the key.
 For instance, when there is a match on the Map’s key “Animal” …</span>

I can&#x27;t seem to grasp this traversal, can anyone help with a sample code snippet regarding this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>In ancient times, computer programs were shared as software listings in magazines. You had to type the code yourself.
Now recently on Mastodon a C64 BASIC listing for a Zettelkasten was shared. Unlike normal code listings, this is a hexdump listing, so you&#x27;d be typing pages of hexadecimal codes.
It&#x27;s much tougher to debug arbitrary hex characters than it is to debug BASIC syntax.
If anyone with a C64 is inclined to do so, please share screenshots

                              <span>Background: Running Emacs on Windows (without WSL). I&#x27;m trying to do org-latex-preview, and I&#x27;m getting failures. This worked fine until about a month ago. In fact, any LaTeX export I do via org mode fails.
 The log shows this:
  ... (c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/textcomp.sty) ! Emergency stop.  l.30 \begin{document} ^^M No pages of output. system returned with code -1 
 There&#x27;s a message to edit org-preview-latex-process-alist
 Thing is, I&#x27;ve been down this road before. The reason it&#x27;s failing is pygmentize, and the solution on the Internet is to add -shell-escape to the latex/pdflatex commands. I did that at some point last year and LaTeX export worked fine - until recently.
 Digging into the code (org-compile-file), I see this line:
 (shell-command (format-spec command spec) log-buf) 
 The value of (format-spec command spec) is:
 latex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory &quot;c:/Users/me/AppData/Local/Temp/&quot; &quot;c:/Users/me/AppData/Local/Temp/orgtexTdvuhN.tex&quot; 
 When I run this command verbatim in my console, everything runs fine. When I run it via shell-command, it fails with the error above.
 I&#x27;m at a loss as to why it fails with shell-command. I confirmed that it&#x27;s running the same LaTeX executable, and pygmentize is there in the path system-wide.
 Ideas?

                              <span>Hi all,
 My current theme employs darker colors for the foreground and background. However, when I launch emacs, it takes like a second to invoke my theme config and in that moment, launches with a blinding white background (default). How can I disable this behaviour? Thanks.

                              <span>I have the following function on js-json-mode-hook:
 (lambda () &quot;Use spaces instead of tabs in JSON mode.&quot; (make-local-variable &#x27;js-indent-level) (setq js-indent-level 2) (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)) 
 If js-indent-level is set to 2, then 2 spaces are inserted as expected for each indentation in a JSON file. But if js-indent-level is set to 4, a tab is inserted instead of 4 spaces. I&#x27;m at a loss trying to figure this out. Is some other setting overriding js-indent-level? If so, why when it is set to 4 and not when it is set to 2? How can I get 4-space indents in JSON files?
 Edit: It turns out that setting a custom value for tab-width elsewhere in the config somehow had the effect of overriding the value set by indent-tabs-mode by setting it to t.

                              <span>I have been unable to identify the source of this behavior. Heck, I&#x27;m not sure what I do that triggers it to start. It doesn&#x27;t happen after a restart of emacs.
 In a programming mode, (fortran or lisp), I&#x27;ll start spacing at the end of a line to add a trailing comment and I see that a period is placed after the last word on the line.
 I&#x27;ve gone through the list of major and minor modes active and I can&#x27;t see any that would do this. I checked lossage and it shows a self-insert of a period, but I absolutely did not type one.
 I&#x27;m still trying to pin down what I do that makes this start happening. Once it starts, it&#x27;s on everywhere.
 Any advice or does anyone know of this behavior?

                              <span>For a group project, I am building a compiler in Haskell. Today is the deadline and I have an idea of adding a &quot;verbosity&quot; flag to the compiler that prints internal information like &quot;detected unused variable, removing the node&quot; or &quot;Found constant x &#x3D; 4 and replacing used instances of x&quot;, etc. 
 However, our code currently does not support having a string to append throughout the journey of the program. Additionally, using (++) on Strings is poor performance and our professors would not like it. 
 I thought of using Debug.Trace to do this, but the Documentation recommends not to use it in production since it forces a value to be computed instead of being lazy. 
 What can I do?

 I want to create a prompt that reads in an inactive timestamp and formats it according to the string &quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;. TMK, the way to do this would be
 %^{Set Completion Time}
 according to the org-mode manual, but it doesn&#x27;t work; it produces a prompt without the autogenerated timestamp and leaves the  in place.

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a package that I could use to read an org document in emacs (without exporting) that would do some transformations like: 
 - hide all #+ directives
 - show header with alternative font and/or font-size depending on the node level
 - show code blocs with syntax-highlighting, quote blocs etc without showing extra delimiters (like &quot;SRC&quot;)
 - allows one-key navigation like in info-mode
 A package that is close to this requirements is the org-tree-slide mode but it assumes that nodes are slides (i.e. short) and does not deal with longer paragraphs as nicely as info-mode.
 The objective is to have a as close to paper look as possible and one-key forward navigation.

                              <span>Tapir maintainer here. We are planning to stop supporting Scala 2.12 in the near future. There is still a small group of active downloaders, so I would like to take the opportunity and publish an open question: If you depend on Tapir for Scala 2.12, what are your circumstances? Are there any significant blockers that prevent you from migrating to Scala 2.13? Let us know, and our team at SoftwareMill will plan the discontinuation accordingly. Thanks!
