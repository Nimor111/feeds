 I&#x27;ve been looking for a while now,
 For how to display the register, we are currently using when we start typing &quot;+ or simply by starting to type &quot; for example in the bottom like in vim?

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to understand something about elisp that I have now struggled with for days and simpy cannot figure out - so I hope for some wizzard here...
 This is part of my configuration (it&#x27; about replacing the language-names of source-blocks with svgs - but that is not what this posting is about):
 (setq svg-tag-tags &#x27;( (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) ) ) 
 As you can see the lambda expression for the languages is exactly the same in both cases, so I wondered if it was possible to factor that out and try something like this:
 ​
  (fset #&#x27;mh/myl (lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)) (setq svg-tag-tags &#x27;( (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(elisp\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(perl\\)&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (svg-tag-make tag :inverse t :radius 12)))) (&quot;#\\+BEGIN_SRC \\(python\\)&quot; . (#&#x27;mh/myl) ) ) 
 So the idea is to store the lambda in the function-slot of a symbol and then use that symbol instead of the lambda but for reasons that are beyond me it does not work. (If it worked for python you would of course use this approach for all the other languages as well and then would only need to update one place should you ever want to change the appearence of the svgs).
 I have tried every conceivable permutation of quoting (or not quoting), of sprinkling in some call to symbol-function etc but I cannot make it work. Some variations compile fine but in the end none of them work.
 And I wonder: Why does this not work? What is it that I do not understand about symbols and lambdas?
 And what would be the proper way to do that (provided it is possible at all)?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I noticed a difference between cider eval last sexp and the default function and i&#x27;m wondering if this is intentional
 in elisp if I have &#x27;(+ 1 1)&#x27; and i have the cursor on the last &#x27;)&#x27; C-xC-e will give me 2.
 however in cider running eval last sexp on the ending &#x27;)&#x27; will only evaluate the sexp one char to the left of the &#x27;)&#x27;, in this case 1. to get it to eval 2 I&#x27;d need to jump one char to the right with my cursor, ie outside of the &#x27;)&#x27;, is this intentional?

                              <span>Caffine is a program to keep screen on, e.g., to disable screen saver. It never worked nicely for me. So I finally did a bit of research and wrote the following elisp script to toggle screen saver using the xset command. Placing it here incase its of use to others.
 (defun jds/toggle-caffeine () &quot;Toggle screen to stay awake versus allow screensaver.&quot; (interactive) (save-match-data (let* ((settings (shell-command-to-string &quot;xset q&quot;)) (_ (string-match &quot;DPMS is \\(\\w+\\)&quot; settings))) (pcase (match-string 1 settings) (&quot;Disabled&quot; (progn (shell-command &quot;xset s on\nxset +dpms&quot;) (message &quot;Can&#x27;t keep.. eyes... open....&quot;))) (&quot;Enabled&quot; (progn (shell-command &quot;xset s off\nxset -dpms&quot;)) (message &quot;We going to RAGE!&quot;))))))

                              <span>Hi !
 I&#x27;m looking for a library to read / write on any process memory in Scala.
 In node, we have &quot;memoryjs&quot; (https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoryjs) for example that does that rather easily (drop a package.json with one dependecy, and you are up and running !).
 Is there any librabry available that can do that in Scala (I&#x27;ve juste spent one hour searching on the net without success ...) ? Thanks ! :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a CLAP audio plugin host for Haskell and running into issues when trying to use the C FFI on Windows. The same code works on Linux, so I&#x27;m assuming this is a longstanding Windows issue given all the warnings I&#x27;ve seen about using Haskell on Windows. And the same thing happens on every GHC version I&#x27;ve tried (8.8.4, 8.10.7, 9.2.5, and 9.4.4).
 The error message is &#x60;Access violation in generated code when executing data at 0x7ffd3aa06366&#x60; with a stack trace that points to an invocation of a method inside a struct field. The weird thing is that if I call the same method in the same Haskell function that the struct is created, it works fine. Which makes it sound like the struct got destroyed or relocated in memory. But if I print the C struct&#x27;s address and the address of all of its method field, they&#x27;re exactly the same as when it was created.
 My first thought was that the garbage collector had freed up its space, but that shouldn&#x27;t be possible since there is a persistent reference to the struct stored in an &#x60;IORef&#x60;. And using &#x60;StablePtr&#x60; didn&#x27;t have any impact.
 Anyone run into something like this before, or have better ideas how to debug it? And if not, where would be a better place to report this issue?

                              <span>Google Summer of Code is a long-running program by Google that supports Open Source projects. Haskell has taken part in this program almost since it&#x27;s inception!
 It allows everyone (since 2022, before that it was only students) to contribute to projects for a stipend. However, in order to do that, we need to have some ideas of what to contribute to.
 In the past, this has led to many improvements for GHC, Cabal, HLS, Hasktorch... and it can include your project as well! This is a great way to find contributors for your project (even after the summer ends) -- many past participants have become involved long-term.
 You can find more info and instructions on how to participate here: https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html.

                              <span>So, after working through &quot;Haskell from First Principles&quot;, I felt confident enough to try writing a BF interpreter. I could implement most instructions, namely: 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  increase memory pointer
 + increase cell value currently pointed at
 - decrease cell value currently pointed at
 , get char and write value to cell currently pointed at
 . print char from cell currently pointed at &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 without problem, but when trying to implement the loops I got stuck, more specifically, when handling nested loops and the accumulated instructions (one-layer loops are executed correctly at the moment). 
 Basically what I did is the following (sorry if it is too much, thank you for reading this post):

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell with the dream of developing beatiful functional models. I&#x27;ve gone through the exercise of models from scratch. I am now interested in porting over some of my deep learning models from PyTorch. For this to work, I would want automatic differentiation and GPU execution. I&#x27;ve peeked at Hasktorch and the Tensorflow Haskell bindings, but I&#x27;m really interested in the slick interface of the backprop package. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a viable path given the repo has posted issues regarding GHC 9.0 and accelerate compatibility. Does anyone have recent experience with backprop and accelerate? Are there alternative recommendations for automatic differentiation?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on the Book of Monads by Alejandro Serrano Mena. One of the exercises from the book:
  
Exercise 7.1. Write the Functor and Monad instances for Either e. By convention, a successful return value is encoded by Right.
  
My implementation following the other examples in the book:
 data Either e r &#x3D; Left e | Right r instance Functor (Either e) where -- fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b fmap _ (Left x) &#x3D; Left x fmap f (Right x) &#x3D; Right (f x) instance Applicative (Either e) where -- pure :: a -&gt; f a pure &#x3D; Right -- () :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b Right f  Right x &#x3D; Right (f x) _  Left x &#x3D; Left x instance Monad (Either e) where -- return :: a -&gt; m a return &#x3D; pure -- (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b Right x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; f &#x3D; f x Left x &gt;&gt;&#x3D; _ &#x3D; Left x 
 But I don&#x27;t understand why the instances are defined using only one type e where the constructor has two types, e and r.

                              <span>I created an example repository. I&#x27;m aware of tricks such as this one. But I find it really hard to avoid the increasing right indentation without making the code hard to understand because of runExceptT and the likes everywhere. To give you a bit more info before clicking the repository link: in the actual app, m would be the application monad (think ReaderT pattern), and so you might often see m (Maybe String) or m (Either String) being returned. It&#x27;s then hard to compose two functions like that. I&#x27;m aware that you can do MonadPlus m and MonadError String m but I can&#x27;t get this to work while still preserving the error messages depending on where I got a Nothing value.

                              <span>I just released a package that allows grouping frames, buffers and window configurations per (user-defined) project. It makes use of the built-in packages desktop.el and tab-bar.el. You can find more information and some video demos on the website: https://github.com/overideal/perject
 I am happy to hear your comments and suggestions!

 Written in Vanilla JS, generation happens entirely in browser.
 Automatically adds some default faces for few Emacs packages.
 Vim version also comes with 256 color support for terminals.
 Feedback is much appreciated.

[a]ll recipients
 [l]ist only
 [s]ender-only
  
What&#x27;s missing is the option to reply to the address defined in the original mail&#x27;s &quot;reply-to&quot; header.
 How do I get mu4e to respect that important header field?

                              <span>Xeft is a note searcher like Deft, with less features but much faster, especially for larger note collections. It uses a dynamic module to index your notes and provide search results.
 It has been around for a while now. I initially planned to extend Deft to use the dynamic module as a backend and keep Xeft to myself, but it turns out there are too many Deft features that I can&#x27;t make to work with the dynamic module backend. I still think this is really cool and want to share it, so I made Xeft publicly available on ELPA.
 In particular, I think it&#x27;ll work pretty well with Denote.
 I hope someone will find the dynamic module useful and come up with cool use cases for it beyond Xeft.

 Dynamic module: https://git.sr.ht/~casouri/xapian-lite

 A demo
 Q: Why not org-roam/rg/etc?
 A: Because they don&#x27;t fit my bill. If you use Deft but it lags, try Xeft, otherwise stick with what works for you.

                              <span>I noticed on this post mention of Meta decommissioning Sigma, their spam fighting tool, which is written in Haskell.
 If true, this news is very bad, since it&#x27;s an example of a major corporation we can no longer point to and say, &#x27;See! Haskell is used in industry!&#x27; And it&#x27;s quite likely I&#x27;ll have to write more weakly typed PHP and JS code, as a result as clients will refuse to take Haskell seriously.
 So does anyone know if this is true? Does anyone have any links?
 Apologies for making a new post about this, I didn&#x27;t get to comment on the other one in a timely manner.

 I see most of its contents are 1. GHC versions, 2. gzipped GHC versions 3. compiled Stackage snapshots
 Let&#x27;s say I can trade time with space at this point; what&#x27;s a good place to start deleting? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the second part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/main/docs/Part02ConcurrentSMTesting.md#readme
 In the previous part we introduced state machine testing building only upon QuickCheck.
 In this part we will build upon the first part and add concurrent state machine testing support and linearisability checking (same technique as used by Erlang&#x27;s closed source quickcheck eqc and Jepsen.
 I hope to announce part three on integration and contract testing next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

Complete code or minimizations would be the best, but describing them and sharing your thoughts would help us well - what might have caused them, which files took the longest to compile, and how did you address them (if you managed to).

                              <span>Hello everyone, big announcement today for the scala community! 🎉
 Until now, the Tour of Scala repo has always been open source (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala) but only regarding the design. The articles were hosted on my own website and just displayed differently on Tour of Scala but not editable by anyone.
 As of today, all the content is also open source!
 💻 Every exercises can be edited by opening a PR on those files (https://github.com/leobenkel/tour-of-scala/tree/main/pages/scala)
 I am looking forward to seeing everyone involved in this community fixing minor mistakes that I could have let slip in, adding more content, adding exercises for Scala 3, for ZIO, and more challenges, and adding new features! 🎉
 As a reminder, the Tour of Scala website: https://tourofscala.com

I&#x27;ve just looked at scala 3 and I didn&#x27;t realize there was a new quiet syntax. If you&#x27;ve previously or currently program python, how are you liking scala?
 Everything seems to match up pretty well with python in one way or another. Really impressed.

                              <span>Here is a blog post Fail with class that has a twofold purpose:
  
It describes a fairly common problem of trying to get a value gracefully from a monadic action that is restricted to MonadFail
 It introduces a new FailT library that provides a good solution to the above problem
  
Please let me know of other libraries that improve usability of MonadFail type class. Also I&#x27;d be very happy to get some feedback on the FailT implementation and design choices.

                              <span>More specifically, about (Flip x)&#x27;s in Flip&#x27;s Functor instance:
 haskell instance Functor (Flip x) where fmap g s &#x3D; case s of Flip (Left a) -&gt; Flip (Left (g a)) Flip (Right x) -&gt; Flip (Right x) 
 This is from A Type of Programming, and I know that this is only a stepping stone to introducing bimap and Bifunctor to achieve the same thing, but just can&#x27;t wrap my head around it.
 I know that Flip has kind *-&gt;*-&gt;*, just as Either, but I also don&#x27;t get how the flipping actually happens. Also, how do we even get that kind signature from this definition?
 haskell data Flip b a &#x3D; Flip (Either a b) 
 I get that the type variables are flipped so should I simply imagine that (Right 7) :: (Either a Int) can be perceived as
  (something not chosen |) Right 7 
 and Flip (Right 7) :: (Flip Int a) as
  Right 7 (| something not chosen)  ?
 Probably overthinking this whole lot...

 Reflex and miso are currently not on stackage and stack gave up on ghcjs a while ago. My dream would be to build a reflex or miso app in a simple and straightforward manner with stack.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have learned to create svg programmatically in emacs and when you do that you get some sort of data-structure that represents the xml that a svg is made of and one can feed that into svg-tag-mode, fine.
 But what I cannot figure out is how to read an existing svg-file into an elisp-variable: I mean not as the raw xml-content but the parsed data-structure that is used to represent it.
 Is that possible? Does anybody know how? 
 I can&#x27;t find any docs or examples...
 Many thanks!

I have a ton of RSS feeds and a ton of entries in the database for those feeds and the dynamic update slams Emacs&#x27; poor single thread pretty hard as I&#x27;m entering a search string. I&#x27;ve not found anything in the docs nor in the elfeed code that suggests I could change the behavior to, say, only update the elfeed-search window after hitting .

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to get svg-tag-mode to use a previously created svg and can neither make sense of the documentation nor find example code anywhere...
 The documentation says:
 You need first to set svg-tag-tags that is a list of item here each item has the form (KEYWORD (TAG COMMAND HELP)) where: .... TAG is either a SVG image that will be displayed using the &#x27;display property or a function that accepts a unique string argument (match-string 1) and returns an SVG image. 
 The second part about the function in TAG is clear and that is what all of the examples use.
 But what does &quot; a SVG image that will be displayed using the &#x27;display property&quot; mean?
 Assuming mysvg is a variable holding an svg I would have guessed that it should be one of this variants but none work:
 (setq svg-tag-tags &#x27;( (&quot;PATTERN1&quot; . ((lambda (tag) (mysvg)))) (&quot;PATTERN2&quot; . (&#x27;display mysvg)) (&quot;PATTERN3&quot; . mysvg) ) ) 
 Here is the code for mysvg:
  (setq mysvg (svg-create 80 80 :stroke-width 5)) (svg-circle mysvg 40 40 25 :stroke-color &quot;red&quot;) 
 So how is that supposed to work - does anybody understand this?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>As a good emacs citizen I&#x27;ve been delving deeper and deeper into integrating emacs to my tasks. Fiddling with some basic elisp (not a programmer) I could facilitate a lot of repetitive stuff I got to do in my masters and in my professional work. It&#x27;s beautiful.
 Now, there&#x27;s another thing I would like to do. As a masters student, it&#x27;s important to always check a lot of websites from the government and research institutions to look for opportunities. There might be some useful notice about a financial support, or a important upcoming event etc. Looking for these, I have to manually check at least a couple dozen websites weekly, and I&#x27;m getting tired of doing all this work manually. It usually goes like this: copy a link from a list, paste into the browser, leading to a news page from some research institution, check if there&#x27;s a new entry, go to the next link...
 Does anyone have a cool idea of how this could be done more easily? I thought about RSS feeds, but a lot of the websites don&#x27;t have them. Also thought about doing some scripting with EWW, in a way that it goes jumping around a given list of websites so that at least I can speed up all the checking. It would also be really cool if there&#x27;s a way to check if a given link has changed overtime, maybe by downloading the html&#x27;s to a temp directory and comparing the files?
 Either way, it&#x27;s something that would be really useful for years and years to come. Does anyone have a suggestion?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at the possibility of a massive change in my position at work. Long and short I&#x27;ll be traveling, A LOT, if I get this position.
 I primarily use a laptop at work (my personal laptop) and run org mode with my notes, todos, and schedule here.
 ​
 Given the travel I might be facing, I&#x27;m looking at getting a tablet. I&#x27;ve only really got a few requirements in mind as a whole. Mostly I want to be able to consume movies, books, reading, etc. But mostly I&#x27;ll be working with it as well. 
 I&#x27;m hesitant to go back to an i-pad for one primary reason. Mostly I&#x27;m more secure conscious these days and I prefer plain text where ever possible and self hosted everywhere else. 
 ​
 Android isn&#x27;t much better on the security front, but I&#x27;m heavily considering it. I do currently use an iPhone, though…</span>

 Is that the case with you all too? Is it worth a new coder jumping straight into Scala or is first understanding the fundamentals of Java better?

I found out that there wasn&#x27;t any library in scala written yet fitting my needs. So, I decided to create my library. I am new when it comes to libraries and I would I like to share it here for you, if anyone is interested to give feedback, maintain and use it as they like. andrewrigas/oath (github.com)

                              <span>Hi,
 many modes (let&#x27;s take rainbow-mode as an example) can be toggeled by calling the function that turned it on again. So in M-x I can toggle rainbow by calling (rainbow-mode) again and again.
 Now let&#x27;s say I want to do that via a keybinding.
 I have this function in my config:
 (defun mh/toggle () (interactive) (message &quot;here&quot;) (rainbow-mode) ) 
 And have bound this function to a key. When I press the key I can see the message written - so it gets called, however the rainbow-mode is not toggeled. 
 I have also tried to run (rainbow-mode nil) to turn it off from the function but that does not work either. I have also tried some construction with &quot;with-current-buffer&quot;, all to no avail...
 So why is that? What is the proper way to do such manipulations from a function?
 Please note that this is not about rainbow-mode as such (I just use it as an example) but it&#x27;s about functions in elisp.
 Many thanks!

 Select one of the safe coding systems listed below, or cancel the writing with C-g and edit the buffer to remove or modify the problematic characters, or specify any other coding system (and risk losing the problematic characters).

 I am using vertico-posframe to show the completion window at the top center. However, I would like that the background to be darker than the default background color. I tried many things to change this color (customize vertico-posframe face, pass the option background-color to posframe, etc.), but I did no succeed.
 Can anyone help me?

                              <span>Can anyone suggest how to customize emacs so the “up-arrow” key gives you history in a repl ? ( like a bash shell ) . I’m using sly with lisp and ctrl-R provides something like that but it’s a bit weird.

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce the release of Kele 0.2.0. Changelog is viewable here.
 This release&#x27;s marquee feature is kele-get, Kele&#x27;s answer to kubectl get. With kele-get you can interactively specify the kind and name of the resource that you&#x27;d like to get and display its manifest in a separate buffer. What&#x27;s more, it supports custom resources right out the gate -- a long-standing functionality gap in kubernetes-el (for which I&#x27;m a co-maintainer so pardon the candor).
 GIF time!
 See How-Tos &gt; Usage &gt; Working with Resources in the Kele documentation for more details. It&#x27;s very much an MVP so there are some rough edges. Please open an issue for any peculiar behavior that you notice, or feel free to start a discussion if you wanna chat or throw ideas around.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have one of the following stanzas in my config:
 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook org-mode) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode)) (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode . rainbow-mode)) 
 As far as I understand the documentation they should all be equivalent and should turn rainbow-mode on in org. 
 But they don&#x27;t. None of these versions work at the moment. No error, just no rainbow-mode (I can turn it on manually without problem).
 But here is my problem: They did work yesterday. 
 I have not changed anything about rainbow-mode but I must have changed something else that seems to have a side effect.
 This is driving me crazy now, I don&#x27;t care about rainbow mode at all - all I want is to understand what is going on here...
 I am new to emacs and have no clue on how to attack this - does anyone have an idea?
 My config is an org-file that gets tangled when it&#x27;s written but this mechanism seems to work ok, the generated el-file is in sync with the org...
 I would be grateful for every tip.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Right now, the buffer for org-roam-node-find lists only the title and tags. I&#x27;m trying to add the create date of the node to this list as well. After reading high and low, this is as close as I&#x27;ve gotten:
 (cl-defmethod org-roam-node-date ((node org-roam-node)) (org-roam-node-file-mtime node))
 (setq org-roam-node-display-template &quot;${title:*} ${date} ${tags}&quot;)
 When I do this I get &quot;wrong type argument: sequencep, xxxxx&quot; when trying to find or insert a node.
 Any ideas on how I can make this work?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Just wanted to share some quick updates about my work. HVM has been receiving continuous updates, and is on 1.0.0 now. The parallelism is greatly improved and more general, there are several stability improvements, and it is faster than ever. Kind, the dependently typed programming language, keeps evolving. Kindelia, which was a currency-less p2p computer based on HVM that I never officially announced, has been paused to let me focus on HVM and Kind, but will be resumed in the future.
 I&#x27;m so positive and enthusiastic about the future of HVM that I believe it must have a much bigger team to thrive. With that in mind, I&#x27;m launching a tech startup - the Higher Order Company - which will focus entirely on pushing HVM to the next level, building valuable products around it, and paving the way …</span>

                              <span>Currently I am using HSpec + Tasty on my projects, but I am getting a bit confused if I really even need Tasty next to HSpec, and also what is the role of HUnit in all this, and recently I saw there is also sydtest which sounds more integrated. Therefore I would love to hear what others use / recommend!
 I am really looking for the most standard solution.

                              <span>After reading Chris Okasaki&#x27;s Purely Functional Data Structures, and understanding how to analyze functional data structures (admittedly a re-read might be necessary to fully understand), I ask how to do the same for Monads? The question really came to mind from the debates made between using mtl or other effects systems, where people reiterate that the problem with mtl is the O(n2) instances. I apologize in advance for any incoherency in my question!

                              <span>I am trying to understand WAI and warp web server. I am going through this video by Michael Snoyman where he explains the problem.
 Initially, he presents the core data types here in the video. The Application type should be:
 type Application &#x3D; Request -&gt; IO Response 
 This feels intuitive but it is not especially when it streaming of the data using lazy bytes as explained here in the same video. And, then it concludes that the Application type is actually of:
 type Application &#x3D; Request -&gt; (Response -&gt; IO ResponseReceived) -&gt; IO ResponseReceived 
 What I don&#x27;t understand is how lazy Bytestring works! Where the the back-pressure is in the lazy part? And, why does the file handle gets closed before sending the response? The sample code from the video is:
 type SimpleApp &#x3D; Request -&gt; IO Response simpleRun :: Int -&gt; SimpleApp -&gt; IO () main &#x3D; simpleRun 8000 $ \request -&gt; withBinaryFile &quot;big-file.csv&quot; ReadMode $ \h -&gt; do lbs &lt;- BL.hGetContents h pure $ responseLBS status200 [(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;text/csv; charset&#x3D;utf-8&quot;)] lbs 
 So, isn&#x27;t the Bytestream being fed at lbs &lt;- BL.hGetContents h line and then used at the very last line? The function withBinaryFile is being called in the callback function and that would wait till the response is sent at pure $ ... line, won&#x27;t it?
 Any conceptual model I can imagine to better understand and visualize this?

                              <span>I just watched a video talk of John De Goes and I liked it very much. It was from 10 months ago. There were perhaps a couple of things missing or which could be presented in another talk to complement this one, but this one is excellent.
 A big part at the beginning would seem elementary to some people, but his way of introducing FP and OOP and how they differ could be very useful to other viewers.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9hAcW2oMl6M
 Other videos and books I&#x27;ve been reading discuss FP fundamentals which are distinctly different than OOP practices and it would be helpful to see how &quot;effects free&quot; and &quot;invariable data&quot; would best be incorporated into that list of Best Practices. Getting a fuller inclusion of strong FP ideas would help even the OOP methods to be better and for more …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been learning org mode and this year is the ear I want to fully dump my notion based system and migrate into org-mode. Most things I have figured out how to solve but I wanted to get a temperature check on how best to save myself duplicate data entry as I manage my daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews. 
 The Goal
 Each day I will use org-roam daily capture template to generate a form with two main sections: 
  
Morning Stack
 Evening Stack
  
These will be largely data capture and routine outlines for myself. I&#x27;ll likely utilize a &#x27;metric&#x27; capture with gnuplot for things like my weight, sleep rating, mood etc. Direct links to my repeated routines i.e. mindset, gratitude type stuff. 
 In Notion I currently will use the relational database system to have each thing nested and rolled into each other so for example my weekly review has each of the 7 days of that week linked into it and I use a database roll up to grab the data entries for easy review that week. 
 In this at the end of each week I have a baseline of information of what happened that week ready to review, it also has some of its own higher level routines &amp; processes built in there too. 
 I&#x27;ve considered using org-refile copy but its a little bit more of a manual process. I&#x27;m thinking some of that might be able to be automated either through some elisp or macros. However, before I go through doing all of that I figured I&#x27;d ask here for any insight since many of you are much more familiar with org and its tricks than I am.
 Ultimately I want to roll from daily into annual. (Daily -&gt; Weekly -&gt; Monthly -&gt; Quarterly -&gt; Annually)

                              <span>Been reading through this article https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html. It&#x27;s not lost on me that it&#x27;s a bit old but I&#x27;ve failed to figure out any solution to a question I had.
 ​
 I had to make an adjustment to the capture template as it was creating each new TODO in as a sub-level of tasks.
 (setq org-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;t&quot; &quot;Todo [inbox]&quot; entry (file &quot;~/org/gtd/inbox.org&quot;) &quot;* TODO %i%?&quot;) (&quot;T&quot; &quot;Tickler&quot; entry (file+headline &quot;~/org/gtd/tickler.org&quot; &quot;Tickler&quot;) &quot;* %i%? \n %U&quot;))) 
 Now I&#x27;ve working through refile and I&#x27;ve noticed that refile only allows me to move the current item to a sub-item in the existing defined file. This makes sense in some cases, however, I think it&#x27;d be more useful to be able to create new top level headings in the gtd.org file. Say a new project emerges is one case....
 ​
 I have tried change the max level setting, to no avail as well as setting 
 org-outline-path-complete-in-steps 
 which did appear to work at first, but this was unsuccessful as well. 
 ​
 So I&#x27;m curious, am I thinking about this the wrong way (as a general practice in org-mode... ) or have a messed up some settings here.
 ​
 I&#x27;ll add that I&#x27;m completely open to advice in org mode and even my GTD process (I&#x27;m new to both.... although I read the book years ago)

                              <span>When I&#x27;m editing some non program files such as documentation for instance, there are times when I need completion for function names or variables of one language or the other.
 For example I many need completion for some functions and variables from some C or Lisp project I am editing, and I need to trigger it momentarily or temporarily for names from the project then turn it off after I get the names I want.
 It would be a good to have a some file-local variables that hold a list of project directories and file types that would provide the completion canditates then toggle them on and of when needed.
 One of my configurations had a completion that showed a list of groups that the completion at point could be based on, but it hasn&#x27;t been coming up of late.

                              <span>Hi,
 this is getting frustrating for a noob like me...
 I have this:
 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode rainbow-mode)) 
 This does NOT work. The package is installed correctly and works but is not turned on automatically in org.
 The I have this:
 (use-package org-appear :ensure t :hook (org-mode org-appear-mode)) 
 This also does not work, same problem as above.
 Do you see the patttern?
 But I also have this:
 (use-package svg-tag-mode :ensure t :hook (org-mode svg-tag-mode)) 
 And this DOES work.
 So what is the f... difference?
 Many thanks

                              <span>According to the info, &quot;The mode’s hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is disabled.&quot; 
 I would like my hook to behave in one way when the mode is enabled, and differently when it&#x27;s disabled. What is the best approach for that? Is there any way to make the hook aware of its context?
 ​
 Some more info about my use-case: this is for my work-in-progress package sticky-shell, whose main purpose is to define a minor mode in a shell buffer, displaying a header with the latest prompt. This makes it easier to keep track of which command was run, even in cases where the command has many lines of output. I&#x27;ve noticed that, some times, the command can be quite long and not fit within a single header-line. For these cases, I&#x27;ve come up with &#x60;sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode&#x27;, which is an additional mode shortening the header.
 I would like this additional mode to be &quot;tied&quot; to the sticky-shell-mode, so that when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode is also automatically disabled. 
 I&#x27;d also like users to be able to turn on/off shorten-header-mode whenever they want, and choose whether to run a sticky-shell-mode hook to automatically enable the shorten-header-mode every time they enable sticky-shell-mode.
 In my mind, all of these features would be accomplished by keeping the two as separate modes, and constructing a hook for sticky-shell-mode that will be context-aware, so that when sticky-shell-mode is enabled the hook automatically enables shorten-header (if the user opts in to this feature), and when sticky-shell-mode is disabled, the hook automatically disables shorten-header.
 ​
 Does anybody have suggestions for this? Should I try a different approach instead?

                              <span>Hi!
 For the past I_do_not_know_how_many years, I have constantly been switching between Vim/NeoVim and Emacs. Recently, NeoVim was my editor of choice due to the blazing fast development pace. In a very short time, we gained a very powerful scripting language, tree-sitter support, LSP, etc.
 From the user&#x27;s point of view, Emacs seemed stalled. Since I did not participate in the development, Emacs was just a colossal inertia going on in a uniform movement for me.
 However, things did change A LOT in the last few years. Emacs 29 is just amazing! We have tree-sitter support, LSP support, native compilation, etc. The community packages are fantastic (as always) and very well-integrated. The experience could not be better.
 I would like to thank all the devs for their amazing work.
 I also need to mention Doom emacs, which helped me with a fantastic set of sane default configurations.

                              <span>How would you write or edit this function so that it only returns buffers which are of files.
 It would ignore buffers like dired direcetory buffers or help menu buffers etc. It would only return buffers like main.el or module.py or my-textfile.txt.
 I am still new to elisp and I appreciate it. If you show me I will study it to understand better going forward. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have been using Emacs for a while now, and had set it up very well to suit my old Ubuntu system (used Emacs 27.1). Now having switched to Mac, I am facing several issues. I am unsure whether it is due to the usage of the 28.2 Emacs version or the Mac that is causing these issues. I have listed them all below. Please provide any help you can for any of the issues.
  
When I do C-x 5 f , the new frame which is opened has the default settings of font and not what is on my ~/.emacs . However the theme (cobalt-blue) is as defined on my init file. The piece of code I use for font is (set-frame-font &quot;Monospace Bold&quot;) . Is this sufficient to keep the font same across all buffers and frames I open on my Emacs? If not, how do I fix this issue? If you think there is something else that is overriding this command and leading to my problem, please let me know. I will provide more details from my init file.
 To open Emacs from terminal I followed the steps provided here. However, I am unable to open a specific Emacs file from my terminal. Whenever I try to do emacs file.py it opens the only the emacs GUI front page without loading the contents of file.py. It says on the terminal -bash: .emacs: Permission denied. How do I fix this issue and open the file.py on Emacs?
 The keyboard for Mac is different from the one I used for my Ubuntu system. The Command key plays the role of the Control key here, but has many more features. I added the line (setq mac-command-modifier &#x27;control) to map my Command key to Emacs control key. However, this messes up everything because the fundamental operations using Command key (such as closing files using Command-q ) is not working. So is there a good key mapping (For Control and Meta keys) for Emacs for MacOS that someone can suggest?

                              <span>I have an Elisp list that looks like this: &#x27;(((&quot;a&quot; . 13) (&quot;b&quot; . 21)) ((&quot;a&quot; . 42) (&quot;b&quot; . 45))). 
 How can I extract a new list that has all elements that start with &quot;a&quot;?
 I tried to ask chatGPT to solve this one, but to no avail.
 Sure most people here are smarter than me and chatGPT...

                              <span>I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t already part of the standard python package (at least not for 27.2). In python mode, Is there a way to get a &quot;f&quot; prefixed to a string if you type a &quot;{&quot; while typing inside a string?
 I tried writing my own solution but it relies on regexp and is fragile. I think I saw a solution a year ago but it relied on the tree-sitter package which I had trouble installing.

 For those not familiar with the auto close tag / auto rename tag extension, it works like this:

 And if i edit the first  to be let&#x27;s say , then immediately the second  becomes a .

 But i can&#x27;t find any documentation about it ? I was thinking maybe it will be published once its officially released, but it seems this is the case now : https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-6-1-alpha1-is-now-available/5585.
 Is it too soon ? Or maybe it exists and i missed it ?

                              <span>I am writing a text for school and I have to cite in &quot;The Chicago Citation Style&quot; Author-date. I would like to write the text in org-mode and export it into a latex/pdf file. I already tried to manipulate the latex file that org produced to make it cite with this style, but I wasn&#x27;t able to make it work. So is there a way to this directly in org mode.

                              <span>As org-mode users we have many built-in functions for text , but often we deal not only with text but within files, with operations by the files themselves. Which also need to be organized. For these goals org-attach are quite suitable.
 What to do with attached files to org-heading when subtree moves to another file, to archive or backup folder? It is necessary to move or copy files with their folder to the archive.
 In search of solution for moving attached files found function . Unfortunately, it does not work fully. If you refuse operations directly from the agenda some code can be removed, (org-with-point-at-org-buffer etc. But the new-dir value does not appear at the stage (when-let.. . Have not found other solutions.
 What features do you use to move file attachments to other folders/locations when archiving?

                              <span>Using Org-mode, I completed HoMM3&#x27;s second scenario, Guardian Angels, 150% faster than existing playthroughs. My results are peer-reviewed on r/Heroes3; ratio is 90%. (Scenario 1 Org-mode analysis here.)
 The entire scenario boiled down to to planning the first turn correctly. I shudder to imagine doing so without Org-mode to reduce complexity.
  
First I iterated the list of operations by studying the map.
 Then I grasped the strategic plan of 4 main heroes each clearing a surface quadrant.
 Then I iterated the tactical logistics of turn 1 to transform a haphazard landing zone into a well-supported blitz.
  
The outline simplified the process of deduction in #1-2, allowing me to focus on execution with a clearly-defined goal in #3.
 This YouTube Org-mode demo video shows how I used a single outline to
  
study the map
 iterate operations and tactics
 publish my results
 follow up.

 There is one more scenario in the campaign. Then I will write the campaign strategy document. Let me know how I can improve the series.

                              <span>I run a GTD setup with a separate inbox.org file and want my agenda to show me all entries from this particular file ever though they are not tagged and have no &quot;TODO&quot; status. 
 Longer explanation: In my setup, I assign the TODO status while doing weekly review to tasks I intend to do this week. Thus, I do not want to add a TODO status to inbox items, since I would have to remove it in most occasions before I refile the task. Problem is: I also would like for inbox items to be shown in agenda, since I have to act (refile) on them. But agenda is for tasks only, as far as I understand. 
 Of course, I could assign some tag like ::INBOX:: to inbox items, but it makes no difference, since I would have to remove it later too, or write a custom refile function which removes it. 
 Is it possible to force agenda to display all not-scheduled, not-task items from a particular org-documents only?

                              <span>I recently started working with the org-journal and maintaining the daily note. I went through the org-journal documentation and decided to add the :carried: tags for carryover items (especially todo items TODO, STRT, ...) instead of deleting them from the previous day and rescheduling the carried one to today&#x27;s date (which also I am working on to configure) so that in the calendar view I can see how many days I have spent working on that particular goal. Now every time I try to create a new entry in the journal, all carryover tasks are getting added.
 I also tried configuring  (setq org-journal-carryover-items &quot;-carried&quot;)  but after adding this one, org-journal started to tag my non-todo items with that and include the non-todo items as carryover tasks which I don&#x27;t want. This solved the issue of adding carryover tasks though.
 I just want only todo tasks to be carried over the next day once when I create new journal entry.
 If possible I want to mark the task as DONE for older entries also one I mark the carried over tasks as DONE in my current journal entry (:P)

                              <span>I find myself wanting types like Tuple3 Tuple4 etc. Checking Pursuit I found the Data.Tuple.Nested library. Its interesting that this library just nests Tuple. I find this kind of inconvenient for pattern matching as I need to write out all these nested Tuples.
 Does anyone have any idea why the authors just didn&#x27;t implement something like:
 data Tuple4 a b c d &#x3D; Tuple4 a b c d 
 This obviously removes the nesting. But it seems like since Data.Tuple.Nested is its own library there must have been a reason...
 Is this nesting better for some reason?

                              <span>I love org-mode and used it to write the last two publications. The problem is, that Markdown is more widespread and, since it has so many editors, easier to get people to subscribe to. In particular, now that there&#x27;s https://quarto.org
 There are still many things that are better in org-mode, but unless we can give people a way to use it without telling them that they need to use emacs as well, we&#x27;ll be fighting an uphill battle.
 I was thinking of something recently and wanted to pick the communities brains a bit:
 Is there something like a &quot;command-line emacs translator&quot; that can take an org-mode file, execute it and retrurn the HTML or PDF, or ...
 A bit like Quarto, but for org-mode. Does such a thing exist?
 Or is there an emacs version, that&#x27;s fully set-up, so the user doesn&#x27;t need to know anything about it to use it?
 I don&#x27;t mean Doom Emacs. That&#x27;s what my config is built on, but that&#x27;s still too complex for most people.

 Having some kind of subwindow open with a list of potential links which can be selected by the user, and perhaps the ability to sort/separate different kind of links, as in &quot;internal document&quot;/&quot;external document&quot;/&quot;url&quot; or remote vs local links. 
 Is there anything that does this simply, or am I really looking at some serious development work for this?

                              <span>I am looking for ways to split my configuration into multiple files that would work with byte and native compilation. For the past year, I have been using init-loader to load my el files. However, native compilation has always produced many errors like &quot;Assignment/reference to free variable&quot; or &quot;function not know to be defined&quot;. I assume that&#x27;s because each file is compiled separately and some files might depend on packages that are loaded in other files (in other words, I load them in order, but they are compiled separately).
 These warnings haven&#x27;t bothered for the most part, but every once in a while I run into issues because a &quot;function&quot; is actually a macro and it needs to be expanded correctly for native compilation to produce the right results.
 What is the correct way to split configuration into multiple files while making sure that byte and native compilation works?

                              <span>Hi,
 newbie here.
 There are cases (eg. in svg-tag-tags) where you cannot specify (say) a background color, but instead you specify a face to use.
 Now my question is: What face do you use in such cases?
 What I currently do is use a face that is already defined but not used in my document (usually I use org-level-8) that I tweak with custom-set-faces.
 However I feel that this a bit of a hack and it would make more sense to define my own face (that however I don&#x27;t yet know how to do).
 So should this be the way to do it: How would I define a new face that is based on an already existing face and only adjusts some attributes?
 I hope that was understandable....
 Many thanks!

But in so doing, the recent files are listed with their full paths (only with the slight shortening of abbreviate-file-name), and this gives me very long candidates, sometimes longer than the window width, frequently pushing marginalia&#x27;s annotations off-screen, and giving me more hits on this source then I&#x27;d wish for. So I&#x27;d like to shorten these candidates to just their file names, and not their path (or at least as much as it unambiguous, but for the time being I&#x27;m trying it with file-name-nondirectory, even if that means that some duplicates occur which will not be shown in the completion).

 Will lookahead &amp; lookbehind assertions ever be officially added to Emacs regex?
 Or is there any technical reason preventing it?

 why is this not working:
 (use-package rainbow-mode :ensure t :config (rainbow-mode)) 
 I would expect it to ensure that rainbow-mode is installed and turn it on, but it does not turn it on.
 Why? What is the proper way to do that?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to learn myself a little elisp using code-blocks in org mode:
 #+BEGIN_SRC elisp (setq colors &#x27;(&quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot;)) (print colors) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: | blue | red | #+BEGIN_SRC elisp (dolist (item &#x27;(1 2 3)) (print item)) #+END_SRC #+RESULTS: 
 ​
 Now what I don&#x27;t understand here is that the first code block produces the expected output in the result-area, the second code block where I iterate over a list however produces no output.
 &quot;Code block produced no output&quot; is what emacs says - but why? Why don&#x27;t I see 1 2 3?
 Please enlighten me here...

                              <span>This is the first release that was executed via the new GitHub CI. Everything went smoothly, except for an unexpected packaging bug on windows due to text-2.0 linking against libstdc++ by default.
 If you&#x27;re affected by this and have a defunct binary, simply run the installer again.
 We&#x27;re also delighted to announce integration with errors.haskell.org, which already has a couple of GHCup codes documented, e.g. https://errors.haskell.org/messages/GHCup-00010/
 How to update/install
 Follow the instructions here: GHCup 
 Or run ghcup upgrade for existing installations.
 ChangeLog
  
restore proper support for FreeBSD and Linux armv7
 integrate with errors.haskell.org, wrt #434
 allow to overwrite distro detection via config wrt #421 
 this is particularly useful for e.g. Ubuntu derivates, where ghcup doesn&#x27;t pick the optimal bindist, also see the GHCup documentation on overriding distro detection
 
 Add proper support for mirrors wrt #357
 fix a (harmless) bug in ghcup nuke on windows
 improvements to ghcup add-release-channel wrt #708
 fix building newer GHC from source wrt #433
 Fix ghcup install hls -u on windows
 Fix failure with --isolate&#x3D;dir --force
 Add --metadata-fetching-mode arg, fixes #440
 Add content-length property to downloads
 Fix a grave bug on armv7 during installation wrt #415
 improve many warning/error messages (contributions by @taylorfausak)
 some minor optimization in ghcup whereis ghcup
 improve --keep&#x3D;always to not clean up directories in certain circumstances
  
Not there yet
  
TUI on windows has a prototype, but it has performance issues that makes it of questionable usability... needs more investigation
 compiling HLS from within the TUI? This needs more discussion

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been learning Haskell for the past couple of months, and in order to solve a problem I am working on, I need to be able to calculate the diameter of a n-ary tree. However I feel like I&#x27;ve been banging my head against the wall these past few days as I cannot seem to get it to work.
 The tree is represented as a list of pairs that represent the edges of the tree: for example
 [(1,2),(1,3)] will be the following tree:
 1 
 / \
 2 3
 Is there a simple way to calculate the diameter of a tree in O(n)?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Recently I&#x27;ve been trying to understand how Erlang&#x27;s bit syntax works, and in the process wrote a library which does something similar:
 https://github.com/stevana/bits-and-bobs#readme
 The readme is written a bit like a blog post, providing motivation, showing how to use the library and explaining how it&#x27;s implemented. I&#x27;m especially interested in how we can go beyond what Erlang does when it comes working with binary data, I mention some ideas in the last part of &quot;contributing&quot; section.
 I hope you find it interesting, and please let me know if you got any feedback, questions or comments!

                              <span>Hey all, I have been adventuring into the topic of the various programming paradigms and am at a wall in my understanding. I am only moderate at Haskell and know the basics about the more advanced tooling, so I would like someone here to discuss some things with me.
 I will introduce my problem with a code requirement. Suppose a developer of a library has the following function (in C#):
 cs public IEnumerable SortUsingName(IEnumerable items, string algorithm) 
 This is a common problem posed to juniors where they will refactor some code to use the factory and strategy pattern, which would end up looking something like this:
 cs public IEnumerable SortUsingName(IEnumerable items, string algorithm) { var sorter &#x3D; SorterFactory.Create(algorithm); return sorter.Sort(items); }…</span>

                              <span>I was reading through https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/04/async-exception-handling-haskell/ where the author claims it is never safe to recover from asynchronous exceptions. The safe-exceptions package also claims it.
 Now, I&#x27;m not sure what recovering means here, but if it really means catching an exception, doing something and not re-throwing it all the way until the program exits, it sounds extreme. One practical example is as follows: a chat application attempts to send a message to another user, but delivery times out asynchronously, i.e. a caller-imposed timeout. Or perhaps the user cancels the action by pressing a button. Whatever was trying to send the message should do its own cleanup and rethrow, via bracket. However, at some point the application is going to have to present an error gracefully to the user and ignore the exception, not just clean up and crash. Or maybe it wants to reattempt delivery at a later point.
 So, what does it really mean that recovering from async exceptions isn&#x27;t safe? In the previous example, it&#x27;s true that one might not trivially know whether the action completed, failed or did something inbetween, but recovery is still theoretically possible, e.g.: explicit state syncing or reporting back what step failed (did we receive an acknowledgement from the server or did we cancel before?). Perhaps it means that recovery cannot always happen locally and you might often need to propagate exceptions upwards. But taken to the extreme, it seems to imply that async exceptions must always result in a crash, albeit a safe one.

Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be mouse-based, keyboard-based commands would be fine. The recording is from InfoQube, which is unique in letting you make dragged items siblings or subitems of the target, based on the end location of the drag and drop operation.
 ​
 I really, really like many things I can do in orgmode, e. g. assigning many different todo states, filtering items for printing with the noexport tag, using refile for quick archiving etc.
 But for me, there is one seriously glaring weakness in its arsenal: It makes it sooo difficult to move multiple items around in an outline, it&#x27;s not even funny.

                              <span>Is there a way to have emacs evaluate on saving an org-mode .org file if it&#x27;s in the org-agenda-files list and, if not, automatically add it to the list currently in emacs?
 Of course, to keep refreshes on org-agenda and the todos and such up to date. 
 While I found this response to the fact that new files are not added to org-agenda-files I was a bit surprised a save hook of some sort could not be used to do this automagically and without having to resort to inotify or manual triggering of a function or evaluation.

                              <span>Hi All 
 I&#x27;m re-working some MS Azure Labs in powershell and bash to improve my understanding.
 Doing this in org-mode, be gentle, I&#x27;ve been using org for a while but babel not so much. I&#x27;m thinking of blogging my solutions.
 When I run some of the commands they echo things that I don&#x27;t want the world to see. I want the text of the output but with some of the fields obfuscated.
 This needs to be as automated as possible and repeatable.
 example:
 When I log in to Azure I see something like the following. I&#x27;d like to edit the email address and the last part of the Tenant ID as I have done here 
  Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- email@outlook.com Azure subscription 1 29aa18ee-fdf4-49f7-b5f2-xxxxxxxxxxxx AzureCloud 
 I have a notion of running an emacs lisp code block over the output but have not come up with a way to achieve that. 
 Thanks
 Steven.

                              <span>While I use math-preview for most mathematical formulas, quite often I am taking notes on coding topics where I am quite often writing lines like start_date. Currently in org-mode when I type this inline it is subscripting to $start_{date}$ which is, well... not great. 
 Is there a way to disable this behaviour (or better yet, enable it when I want it? ... like with markdown where inline math gets rendered as above denoted by single $ bracketed formulae? This is weirdly something markdown seems to get right over org-mode near as I can tell (as well as the ease of having inline code blocks. denoted by backticks in a line.
 Hunting in the docs I could not see a way to granularly control this without turning off prettier_entities completely which would impact a lot of niceties.

 The main impetus for this was having lots of icloud files, trying to open them from within Emacs, and Emacs opening the local &quot;.icloud&quot; file, causing me to have to open Finder and download the file from there.
 So I wrote up a quick package to help with these cases: automatically download an iCloud file when trying to open it, plus some additional utilities, like downloading a list of files or any file matching a regexp within a given directory. As far as I know these aren&#x27;t easily achievable from Finder or the command line, so it&#x27;s nice to have an Emacs interface for them.
 Sharing here in case people are interested: it needs some more work (see some of the TODOs in the code for example), but I could turn this into a proper package. Any feedback on the code is welcome.
 I&#x27;m also wondering if people can think of different ways to achieve this: Emacs has been around for a long time so I&#x27;m sure it has some functionalities to deal with remote files already. Maybe it&#x27;d be possible to use those built-ins for this purpose as well?

                              <span>I use org-mode for daily notes and journaling at work, with mostly the out-of-the box configuration Doom-emacs provides. However, solving simple issues like enabling pdf-mode or even making use some of the org-mode features feels like a struggle.
 I have hard time actually understanding the internal documentation of emacs - a similar feeling I had with linux when I started. That made me realise how the most valuable resources for learning linux were community created guides and users explaining how they do things: and especially how they refer to documentation.
 Where can I find similar resources for emacs? I mainly am interested in personalising orgmode, like creating templates and macro commands. But also more fundamental things such as where to store work-files, and how to separate personal use of orgmode.

 I hope you are doing well. 
 I am new to both emacs and this sub. 
 I am trying to get company mode to complete variables and functions names, but it is not working. I got company mode installed and the backend set to complete-at-point-function. I am also using lsp\lsp-java and it is working.
 I see in mode-line that company is enabled. I would really appreciate any recommendation to fix this issue.
 Thank you for any help you provide.

                              <span>Good morning,
 I have been struggling with company for awhile and have read the docs on company and still haven&#x27;t come up with the solution to the problem I&#x27;ve got. I&#x27;ve searched for solutions to this, but not unexpectedly, searching for emacs company doesn&#x27;t really get to frequency discussions of the company.el module because company is such a common business word. Anyway, I am open to other suggested completion methods or frameworks, I&#x27;m not married to it. First I&#x27;ll describe the problem:
 I&#x27;ll be writing code and it&#x27;ll try to suggest completion. I don&#x27;t have a good screenshot of this, but sometimes I want to complete something like: my_long_signal_name. I start typing and the suggestions and the completion company provides is my_loNG_SIGNAL_NAME. It doesn&#x27;t appear to correctly maintain the case of the original it&#x27;s retrieving the suggestion from. 
 I thought this was something to do with the dabbrev module, but honestly I thought I told it how to handle cases in the configuration and this clearly isn&#x27;t helping.
 (message &quot;---- Company&quot;) (use-package company :config (setq company-dabbrev-ignore-case &#x27;keep-prefix) (setq company-dabbrev-downcase nil)) (use-package company-statistics :hook (after-init-hook . global-company-mode) (after-init-hook . company-statistics-mode)) 
 For awhile I just got rid of it. Emacs vhdl-mode has tab-completion that works pretty well, just doesn&#x27;t provide the dropdown which is nice if there&#x27;s some confusion as to selection.
 Anyone have a SANE company setup that preserves the case of the suggestion? I have thought maybe I ought to use the etags backend perhaps, and like I said, I&#x27;ve gotten rid of it for awhile, though I do like it&#x27;s path name suggestions in other non-source code documents so I&#x27;d kind of like it back.
 Also open to other completion modules, company just is generally frequently recommended.
 Any ideas on how to properly setup company or another module for this behavior? Thanks!

 Can I have all of that in my org literate config (I assume enabling some mode or something)? If not I guess I&#x27;ll go back to an elisp file for the time being.

For yanking from eww, there&#x27;s the command org-eww-copy-for-org-mode (part of the module ol-eww), although it only preserves hyperlinks, no italics or anything else.
 
For Firefox there is the addon Org Capture -- but for me it just copies plaintext! I already wrote a quick setup guide, if you want to give it a spin, but it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me:
 
  
Org Capture web extension
 Step 1. Add these init lines
 (require &#x27;org-protocol) (server-start) 
 Step 2. Make sure you have a member of org-capture-templates that goes something like
 (&quot;p&quot; &quot;Firefox capture&quot; plain (file &quot;/tmp/captures.org&quot;) &quot;* %a\n%i%?&quot;) 
 Step 3. Run the appropriate one-time command found at https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension#register-emacsclient-as-the-org-protocol-handler -- it may look involved but most of it doesn&#x27;t apply to you, just find the bit that does, and copy paste it into M-x shell.
 Done, now you can capture anything by clicking the toolbar button.

 1) Create a rectangular mark using C-M-Mouse1 or C-X-Space 2) M-x string-rectangle or C-x r t 3) Type some letters in the prompt, observe the effects of the string-rectangle preview, but don&#x27;t press RET -- click somewhere else in the buffer instead 4) Press ESC ESC ESC (this kills the string-rectangle prompt) 5) The string-rectangle preview overlay is now &quot;stuck&quot; and can&#x27;t be removed
 I&#x27;m kind of new to Emacs, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a bug. Is this a configuration issue?

                              <span>I have a directory ~/prescient-test/ with two files in it: one.txt and the-one.txt.
 I have installed Prescient and Vertico, and have set them up as follows:
  
emacs -Q
 load vertico
 (vertico-mode 1)
 load prescient
 load vertico-prescient
 (vertico-prescient-mode 1)
  
I then run C-x C-f, navigate to ~/prescient-test/, and type one.
 I would expect both files one.txt and the-one.txt to show up, but only one.txt does.
 Why does it do that? Am I misunderstanding something about prescient? I can&#x27;t seem to reproduce this with completing-read, which is odd. Perhaps it&#x27;s a problem with vertico?

                              <span>Hello people.
 I have a small annoyance when opening Emacs. I currently have a home brewed config that&#x27;s simple enough for my usage that I don&#x27;t need to rely on the daemon to speed up opening a frame. It should take less than a second but recently for some reason when I open Emacs on KDE the task bar shows the icon for Emacs that then closes to give place to what I think it&#x27;s the Emacs Client simply because the title bar shows &quot;Emacs (Client) *scratch\*&quot; but every process monitor shows it&#x27;s a regular Emacs instance.
 This didn&#x27;t happen before. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs frequently and after about a month of continuous usage I began experiencing this behaviour. No matter how I start Emacs, from command line, from the apps menu, from a key combo shortcut. Always the same.
 I tried hiding the emacsclient.desktop file from my user&#x27;s menu with no luck. This happens in KDE regardless of distro. I have an Arch, Manjaro, Garuda and openSUSE TW, all with KDE and all behaving the same. Even when I completely remove my customization files, the regular, old, white Emacs shows the same behaviour. None of these machines have used the daemon/emacsclient in their current installations so I know there&#x27;s no lingering config from the past.
 Any idea where I can look and/or explain this behaviour.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious. Indeed, others here are too, and lurkers might decloak if the interest builds.
I&#x27;ll share some behind the scenes with you. The notes on forgetting started as one note then I saw that they were about different aspects of forgetting. I had critiqued @ctietze&#x27;s note and suggested explosion, so I eat my own dog food, as we say colloquially.
This morning a note in my review cycle stimulated the creation of a hub to bring the ideas about &#x27;Prompts&#x27;  together in a bumper car fashion. Ideas around creating prompts and their use have cropped up in recent readings, and the note that kicked me in the butt was dated December 19, 2020. It seemed like I couldn&#x27;t not make a hub. The &#x27;Prompts&#x27; hub currently organizes 17 notes on the topic.
What I&#x27;m Working On
12 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
Titles and one-sentence summary/meaning of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I&#x27;m currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If this interests you, please start a thread here, DM me.</span>

                              <span>Looking for suggestions for a good distributed job queue library: - Makes it easy to schedule a one-off job to execute at a specific time, and one worker will pick it up/execute it - Also supports cron style jobs (regularly scheduled jobs vs. one-offs) - Underlying queue persistence could be Redis or Postgres - Ideally it’s a Scala lib, but Java is OK too - Ideally reasonably popular/mature - FOSS
 Something like https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq , but for the JVM.

                              <span>So a pretty fun video popped up on my feed 1 Problem, 24 Languages by code_report. In this video, the author solves a single LeetCode problem in 24 different programming languages (including Scala) and gives his thoughts on his likes/dislikes.
 I thought to share this with this forum because, on the slide where he compares runtime performance, Scala is the worst. Now, I had no expectations given the need for a JVM to start that Scala was going to be anywhere near the most performant languages, but I am kinda shocked it&#x27;s literally in last place.
 The author does give caveats that these performance numbers come from the LeetCode editor and even suggests the entire section could be ignored. But I still thought this would be an interesting topic to discuss.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just wondering how much effort is being made toward pushing Haskell as a webdev language.
 ​
 As it turns out, FP is apparently very popular with JSers, given that JS is a semi-functional language due to its inheritance from Scheme. There have actually been JSers who&#x27;ve said:
 ​
 https://www.zerotohero.dev/learn-haskell/
 ​
 Around some community Discord servers, I meet quite a few JS devs, and I think a few prominent Haskellers actually came in from JS.
 ​
 The problem is, well, the typical Haskell problem. People come in, learn some degree of Haskell, use pure Functional Programming to improve their baseline programming skills, then go back to whatever language they use, often taking concepts back to them in order to improve the language.
 ​
 In the JS case, though, is there any way …</span>

                              <span>I can’t figure out how to do this:
 flatten :: (??? t1, ??? t2) &#x3D;&gt; t1 (t2 a) -&gt; t1 a flatMap :: (??? t1, ??? t2) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; t2 b) -&gt; t1 a -&gt; t1 b 
 where flatten is a generalized version of concat and catMaybes, and flatMap is a generalized version of concatMap and mapMaybe.
 And more generally, input lists can usually be replaced by Foldable, but how do you get rid of output lists? I know Traversable lets you repackage stuff back, but it’s the wrong way around for this case.
 Solved:
 flatten :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) &#x3D;&gt; m (t a) -&gt; m a flatten &#x3D; (&gt;&gt;&#x3D; foldr append empty) where append &#x3D; () . pure (.:) :: (c -&gt; d) -&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; d unary .: binary &#x3D; (.) unary . binary infixr 8 .: flatMap :: (Alternative m, Monad m, Foldable t) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; t b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b flatMap &#x3D; flatten .: fmap 
 Upd: Alternative versions if you just want an iterator instead of repackaging:
 flatMap :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) &#x3D;&gt; (a -&gt; t2 b) -&gt; t1 a -&gt; [b] flatMap f &#x3D; concatMap $ toList . f flatten :: (Foldable t1, Foldable t2) &#x3D;&gt; t1 (t2 b) -&gt; [b] flatten &#x3D; flatMap id

                              <span>I don&#x27;t use haskell at that much these days, but the problem in code_report&#x27;s &quot;1 Problem, 24 Programming Languages&quot; video piqued my interest. The problem description is:
 Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and of negative integers (0 is considered neither negative or positive). 
 The video presents a haskell solution iterates over the list twice:
 maximumCount xs &#x3D; on max length pos neg where pos &#x3D; filter (&gt;0) xs neg &#x3D; filter (&lt;0) xs 
 and a commenter presents an optimisation using span and dropWhile. 
 Out of the presented solutions, only C++ used std::equal_range, which performs binary search to find the solution. In wondering if there was an elegant haskell alternative I found the linked article.
 Are there any other idiomatic ways to efficiently approach this problem in Haskell?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on writing a Haskell newcomer guide here: https://haskell-docs.netlify.app/
 The goal is to be the sort of thing that the user in this question is looking for, i.e. something that satisfies this table:
  
  Wiki LYAH Real world Haskell This project Various Books 
  
 Free y y y y n 
  Community editable y n n y n 
  Beginner friendy n y y y y 
  Up-to-date n n n y y 
  Looks nice n y n y y 
  Supports comments n n n y n 
  Good pedagogy ? y y not yet y 
 
 Of these, I think looking really nice, and being easy to edit (but not too easy) via a Github PR are the most important. See more thoughts in this vein here
 This is of course a work in progress, and is at an early stage. But writing something like this is a longterm, multi-person effort, so I wanted to share what I&#x27;ve …</span>

 But I&#x27;m looking specifically for something that is written in &quot;idiomatic haskell&quot; (if such a thing exists) but not too abstract I mean not too much monad transformers for example ;)
 Something like this maybe ? https://github.com/DataKinds/cherchord

As the 2022 State of Haskell Survey highlighted, one of the most desired improvements to the whole ecosystem is better documentation and learning material.
That issue can only be addressed with great effort. For this reason, many contributions are necessary to tackle the problem from several angles.

                              <span>I am looking for a way to improve my workflow while working on a specific function in my code. I&#x27;ve used that function once, but I can&#x27;t remember the exact name. That is an Emacs feature or package that allows me to hide all the code outside of the function I am currently working on while keeping that function visible. This is not the traditional code folding method, which allows toggling visibility of multiple functions or classes at once.

                              <span>How should I add the packages to enable parsing Unicode text, specifically cyrillic and Japanese, when exporting to a PDF in org-mode? Do I have just to specify the Latex packages in the config file?
 I was trying to add \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} and \\usepackage[russian]{babel} while using xelatex, but those didn&#x27;t work: I still didn&#x27;t have any text in the exported files. I have Latex installed correctly. What is the proper way to enable those packages?

                              <span>I am not a good Elisp hacker. When I started using ChatGPT more often, I started experimenting with letting it write Elisp code. 
 I am completely blown away what it can do!
 Example Query
  
Write an Emacs Lisp function that will do two successive regular expression search and replace functions. First it should search for this regular expression ^- and replace by ##, next it should search for this regular expression: ^[ \t]+- and replace by -
  
Result
  
Here&#x27;s an example function that performs the two search and replace operations you described:
  
 (defun my-search-replace () (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;^- &quot; nil t) (replace-match &quot;## &quot;)) (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward &quot;^[ \t]+-&quot; nil t) (replace-match &quot;- &quot;)))) 
  
This function can be called with M-x my-search-replace, you can also assign it to a keybinding, like this (global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c s&quot;) &#x27;my-search-replace)
  
It even EXPLAINS the answer! Wow!
 I&#x27;ll start hacking more Elisp now that I have a patient teacher.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a server that requires a password and one-time code to log in over ssh (no key-based login possible), and this does basically work with tramp after adding the OTP-prompt to &#x60;password-word-equivalents&#x60;.
 However, tramp is having trouble filling in the password automatically even though it does find a corresponding entry in &#x60;auth-sources&#x60; (I&#x27;m using the &#x60;pass&#x60; backend which works fine). I think the issue is that the server _first_ asks for the one-time code, and _then_ for the password.
 Thanks to the power of the recursive minibuffer, I&#x27;m able to call &#x60;password-store-otp-token-copy&#x60; and &#x60;password-store-copy&#x60; when tramp asks for one-time code and password, search for the right entry, then paste the code/password back to the prompt.
 Ideally, I would like to &quot;teach&quot; tramp to find the password on its own so I don&#x27;t need to manually find and paste it every time. Is there a way of telling it which secret to use for which prompt? Alternatively, would it be possible somehow wrap the login process in an elisp function that automates the task?
 I&#x27;m asking here since I&#x27;m a little bit stuck on where / what to look for in the tramp / auth-source source code; I&#x27;ve read the manual pretty extensively but can&#x27;t find much on the topic. Luckily it&#x27;s not a huge issue since the ssh connection is re-used for subsequent logins so I only have to do this once or twice a day, but automating the login process would still be a nice improvement.
 Thanks in advance for the help!

                              <span>I am trying to get a Jupyter-like experience in org mode using org mode. I mostly followed the &quot;Replacing Jupyter Notebook with Org Mode&quot; blog post by sqrtminusone and added some additional config to have conda-environment-aware IDE features in Python mode. You can see my current config here: https://github.com/martibosch/snakemacs 
 The issue is that, although python-mode is activated within jupyter-python src blocks, I do not get proper indentation when I use the tab key. This is expected since org-src-tab-acts-natively is set to nil in my config (following the config by sqrtminusone. However, if I set it to t, everytime I use the RET and TAB keys (bound to org-return and org-cycle respectively) within jupyter-python src blocks, I get the switch-to-buffer behavior (e.g., conda environment activation from conda.el), which makes the editing slow and completely unpractical (tons of &quot;Switched to conda environment&quot; messages). 
 How can I get TAB indentation in my jupyter-python blocks without having this switch-to-buffer behavior? Thank you.

For comparison this is what the suggestions on my emacs config looks like compared to doom emacs and lunarvim. The first is my config, the second is lunarvim, the third is doom emacs. I have enabled company-mode as well as lsp-mode with the clangd server installed on my own configuration.

 Kele (可乐, kě lè, or kə-ˈlə) (“Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs”) is a Kubernetes cluster management package. It empowers you to perform operations as coarse or fine-grained as you need, fast, and get back to your work. 
 For a peek at what&#x27;s currently possible, visit the documentation site, in particular the Usage section. For this initial release, it has feature parity with kubectx and kubens and that&#x27;s about it, but there&#x27;s lots of room for growth.
 It also comes with “batteries included,” containing several integrations with noteworthy packages, in particular Embark, that you can take advantage of for nimbly interacting with your configs and clusters.
 It&#x27;s now on MELPA, so feel free to give it a try and leave your thoughts in the discussion board!
 EDIT: Quick demo GIF for you all

                              <span>Hello,
 I used to be a Scala dev, and I came back to my home country, Korea because of COVID situation.
 Now I&#x27;m thinking of working in abroad again, because I&#x27;m about 40, and it&#x27;s &#x27;RELATIVELY&#x27; old to find a DEV job in Korea. Surprisingly, age is a huge deal breaker when finding jobs, especially DEV jobs in Korea. And it&#x27;s hard to find Scala jobs in my home country because only few people are using it, and I prefer to work in English environment.
 I would say my skill is in somewhere between beginner and mid level (hoping it&#x27;s learning toward to mid). I have limited experience in Cats or IO like that, but I am happy to use it and learn it more. And I can do some front-end dev also.
 Is there any good countries to find Scala jobs more easily? In my view defining &#x27;GOOD&#x27; is,
  
places where plenty of find jobs exists
 gives working visa easily
 decent salaries
  
I think 1 and 2 is most important, 3 is somewhat negotiable.
 I know economy is not good recently, but what else I can do, I need money.
 Thanks in advance.

 I&#x27;m using Cabal to partition my project into a library, tests, etc. like this:

 library exposed-modules: MyModule -- ... other fields
 test-suite MyTests build-depends: MyProject other-modules: MyModuleTests -- ... other fields &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 There is a function MyModule.optimise :: OptimiseIn -&gt; OptimiseOut, and MyModuleTests randomly generates tests that call a function MyModule.interface :: InterfaceIn -&gt; InterfaceOut, which depends on optimise. These tests have allowed me to construct a [InterfaceIn] of inputs for which interface appears to be producing incorrect results. It seems likely that the errors are occurring in the calls to optimise, as o…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been interested in Haskell for years, but never learned it just because there seems to be no VERY good resource to learn Haskell.
 By &quot;VERY good&quot;, I mean ALL of the following are satisfied:
  
up to date
 
official or at least de fact standard
 
general syntax is fully described (variables, arrays, strings, class, functions, loops, etc)
 
it takes tens of hours to read through it (In other words, it should be much detailed than a simple &quot;Getting Started&quot; tutorial.)
 
 Currently, I can write more than 10 languages: Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript etc. And for many of them, there is a VERY good resource.
 Rust has the official the Book. TypeScript has the official Handbook. Go has the unofficial Learning Go - O&#x27;REILLY, which was released 1.5 years ago but almost up-to-date except for the generics support.
 How about Haskell? haskell.org lists some documentations but I can&#x27;t tell if they satisfy the conditions above (especially for whether or not they are up-to-date).

 it&#x27;s left as it is. But if we have

 it should be rewritten as

                              <span>Hi all,
 I was wondering what is the intuition behind the .compile() method of fs2 streams in scala. One thing I notice from examples that some methods are enabled once .compile() is called, for example one could do .compile().count() to count the number of elements of streams. But what does the compile actually do ? 
 Thanks

                              <span>When I learn about haskell and its advanced features I see a lot of people developing compilers, DSLs etc haskell. And there is some fixation with parsers of every kind. Whereas in other general purpose programming languages like cpp, java, rust, python etc I see applications all around, not specific to a particular domain. Why do we not see more use of haskell in things like frontend, servers , game development, smartphone apps , data science etc . I am a newebie so am kind of intrigued why this is the case.

                              <span>Hi all! I wanted to show off a project that I&#x27;m using to learn Haskell language: a &quot;hello&quot; web browser.
 https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The project is based on Dillo web browser (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillo): it&#x27;s an existing project with C and C++ code base, being slowly re-written by me in Haskell. The biggest part written in Haskell is responsible for parsing and matching of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) but there are also other bits of code re-written in Haskell. This is just a side project that I do in spare time, so don&#x27;t expect too much from it :)
 I decided to use an existing project (Dillo) and re-implement parts of it in Haskell because:
  
 I wanted to have a constant feedback on whether my code works or not (a web page either displays correctly or stops being displayed correctly),
 I wanted to see how much more compact Haskell code can be compared to original C and C++ code (so far code stats show no significant improvements in code size, probably due to my lack of knowledge of Haskell),
 I wanted to eventually end up with some &quot;real world&quot; program that has large parts of it in Haskell, and a web browser seemed &quot;real world&quot; enough.
  
​
 The project is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/acerion/hello
 The Haskell code is in this sub-directory: https://github.com/acerion/hello/tree/master/src/Hello
 If you have any feedback or suggestions then I&#x27;m happy to hear them (just be aware that it will take a lot of time for me to take them in, this project is just a big experiment ran in spare time).

                              <span>About us
 Artificial is a leading UK-based Insurtech company. We are working on modernising the global commercial and specialty insurance/reinsurance markets. The majority of this industry centres around London (e.g. Lloyd&#x27;s of London) and provides roughly 8% of Greater London&#x27;s overall GDP. Some example lines insured are property, marine shipping/cargo, energy, cyber security, and political violence. We successfully raised a £9.5M Series A mid-last year.
 As part of our digitisation effort, we developed our own (non-embedded) DSL (in Haskell, of course) called Brossa, with which we can describe insurance products. This approach allows us to build insurance specifics into our programming language as first-class concepts to model structured data capture, data augmentation/enrichment, appeti…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to transition from imperative languages to functional ones, specifically Haskell, and started doing the challenges in HackerRank at the same time that I learn. It&#x27;s a little hard when you come from imperative languages 😓.
 Currently, I&#x27;m struggling with the challenge Compare the Triplets. I&#x27;ve already spent some hours to have this:
 input &#x3D; &quot;5 6 7\n3 6 10&quot; [a&#x27;, b&#x27;] &#x3D; map words $ lines input a &#x3D; (map read a&#x27;) :: [Int] b &#x3D; (map read b&#x27;) :: [Int] score :: (Num a, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a, a) score x y | x &gt; y &#x3D; (1, 0) | x  [(a, a)] -&gt; (a, a) sum&#x27; [] &#x3D; (0, 0) sum&#x27; (x:xs) &#x3D; (fst x + fst (sum&#x27; xs), snd x + snd (sum&#x27; xs)) main :: IO () main &#x3D; print $ sum&#x27; scores 
 It works, but I&#x27;m stuck trying to get rid of input and use interactive instead to get the data. So my questions are:
  
May someone help me with the input part?
 I&#x27;m sure it can be done better, but I&#x27;m not able to figure out how, unless using an imperative approach. May someone point me to a more elegant/haskable way to solve it? (I&#x27;m planning to use a fold for the sum, for example).
  
Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>I want to write a function where you enter a list of delimiters tuples, and a string,
 And the function should check if the string is balanced according to the tuples we input. And return a boolean value.
 ​
 For example:
 ​
 INPUT: balanceList [(&#x27;[&#x27;,&#x27;}&#x27;)] &quot;[}&quot;\&#x60;
 OUTPUT: \True&#x60;&#x60;
 ​
 INPUT: \balanceList [(&#x27;{&#x27;,&#x27;)&#x27;] &quot;{}&quot;&#x60;&#x60;
 OUTPUT: &#x60;False&#x60;
 ​
 Here is my current code:
 balanceList :: [(Char, Char)] -&gt; String -&gt; Bool balanceList pairs string &#x3D; balanced string emptyStack where balanced [] stack &#x3D; isEmpty stack balanced (c:string) stack |c &#x60;elem1&#x60; (map fst pairs) &#x3D; balanced string (push c stack) |c &#x60;elem1&#x60; (map snd pairs) &#x3D; popTest (pop stack) where popTest Nothing &#x3D; False popTest (Just (x,s)) &#x3D; x &#x3D;&#x3D; c &amp;&amp; balanced string s balanced (_:string) stack &#x3D; balanced string stack 
 ​
 When I input balanceList [(&#x27;[&#x27;,&#x27;}&#x27;)] &quot;[}&quot; I get False instead of True
 How can I solve this issue?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m happy to announce the first part of a five part tutorial on property-based testing stateful systems in general, and distributed systems in particular:
 https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial#readme
 I think it&#x27;s a resource that&#x27;s missing, not just for Haskell but the larger (property-based) testing community. Given that I&#x27;ve tried to strike a balance between being general and abstract in the motivation and how it works sections so that people unfamiliar with Haskell can get something out of it, while being concrete in the (Haskell) code sections.
 I hope to announce part two on concurrent testing next week.
 Any questions, comments or suggestions are most welcome!

                              <span>Dear all,
 I&#x27;m very excited to announce release 3.13 of Copilot. Copilot is a stream-based DSL for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.
 Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones. It also serves as a runtime monitoring backend for the requirements elicitation tool FRET (https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/), via Ogma (https://github.com/nasa/ogma). These tools make it trivial to integrate Copilot monitors into other systems, by providing C modules with plain i…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I am new to emacs and just discovered emacsclient.
 What I would now like to have is a shell-alias that would run an emacsclient that automatically starts a server if there isn&#x27;t one but I just cannot figure it out...
 This is what I have tried:
 emacsclient -c -a &quot;emacs --daemon&quot; emacsclient -c -a &quot;&quot; ALTERNATE_EDITOR&#x3D;&quot;&quot; emacsclient -c -a &quot;&quot; 
 In all these cases the client starts and the server gets started but the client does not connect to the server -it only prints &quot;Waiting for emacs&quot; to the console...
 So is there a way to have a command that simply always works - ie. if there is a server it simply connects, if there is no server it starts one and connects?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi! How to enforce proper indentation in built-in python.el mode according to PEP8 for multi-line brackets
 I have sample code: python test &#x3D; { &#x27;abc&#x27;: &#x27;def&#x27;, }  If I write &quot;by hand&quot; closing bracket the indentation (4 spaces) is correct, but when I type C-x h  (or just  in the last line) the closing bracket moves to the beginning of the line: python test &#x3D; { &#x27;abc&#x27;: &#x27;def&#x27;, }  I have variable python-indent-offset explicitly set to 4. Tested on my config with eglot, smartparens and more but also with emacs started with -q flag (no init)

                              <span>I debug C++ programs using dap-mode and lldb-vscode on MacOS. Since a while back, I get Python error messages in the *Out* buffer of the running program. I&#x27;d like to get rid of them. Does anybody know the cause of this and if there is any way of fixing it?
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  NameError: name &#x27;run_one_line&#x27; is not defined Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  NameError: name &#x27;run_one_line&#x27; is not defined Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&quot;, line 1, in  NameError: name &#x27;run_one_line&#x27; is not defined . . . 
 ​
 I have Python 3.10.9 installed. The debug template configuration looks like this:
 (dap-register-debug-template &quot;
&quot; (list :type &quot;lldb-vscode&quot; :cwd &quot;
&quot; :request &quot;launch&quot; :program &quot;
&quot; :name &quot;
&quot;)) 
 Everything works in the debug session, it&#x27;s just the error messages at the start that I&#x27;m concerned about.
 lldb-vscode is installed together with llvm using homebrew.

                              <span>This prevents from using emacs in a full fledged manner and have to depend on some terminal emulator or shell. For eg, I use python a lot and I need ipython to view dataframes properly which look bad within emacs. 
 Also eshell doesn&#x27;t work outside emacs, so I cannot carry over my knowledge of eshell when I have to use some other terminal emulator. There should be an elisp interpreter outside of emacs so that I can write some small scripts within it instead of using python.

I love the fast modal editing keys available at sexp boundaries, and how all commands leave you on such a boundary. I love the use of [] to get to the end of a sexp, and M-m to mark a local string/variable/etc. Slurping, barfing, moving, raising, splicing, combobulating(!). Once you get used to it, going back to editing other languages feels terrifically slow and constraining. (Aside: I&#x27;m really hoping the tree-sitter era brings this kind of power to most languages.)
 But lispy is also highly opinionated, and at times quite intrusive. It takes a bit of the kitchen-sink approach, tuned to one specific workflow, touching all manner of capabilities beyond the basics. It overrides outline regexes, and adds cust…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t seem to find any good resources on this. What kind of formatting and linting do you use on elisp .el source files? I&#x27;d like something which can run linting in flycheck, and hopefully run formatting in apheleia-mode.
 Is there anything like this out there? I&#x27;d love something like how flake8 and black work on python source. Thanks for the help!

                              <span>I do use evil with Emacs 27 and hs-minor-mode.
 When opening a Python file everything is unfolded.
  
I do evil-close-folds (z + m) to close all folds.
 Then I do evil-toggle-fold (z + a) to re-open the current fold (e.g. a class ...).
 And then I go in the next line and do M-x hs-hide-level.
  
The result may look like this:
 class Foobar: def folded_method():... def next_folded():... 
 I don&#x27;t know how to reach that result with less keys presses. This isn&#x27;t the focus of this question but maybe you have a hint? IMHO there is no vi-like &quot;(un)fold-all-in-this-level&quot; function.
 But I would like to add a vi-like (z plus something) shortcut to hs-hide-level also.
  
I&#x27;m not sure which shortcut I should use.
 I don&#x27;t know how to configure vi-like shortcuts.
  
My config looks like this currently
  (use-package evil :init (setq evil-want-integration t) (setq evil-want-keybinding nil) (setq evil-want-C-i-jump nil) :config (evil-mode 1) ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers (evil-global-set-key &#x27;motion &quot;j&quot; &#x27;evil-next-visual-line) (evil-global-set-key &#x27;motion &quot;k&quot; &#x27;evil-previous-visual-line) ;; Set &quot;normal&quot; vi-mode in specific buffers (evil-set-initial-state &#x27;messages-buffer-mode &#x27;normal) (evil-set-initial-state &#x27;dashboard-mode &#x27;normal) )

 Is anyone else having this problem or might know a solution?
 I&#x27;m just using it without any modifications at the moment. In case anyone is wondering how I have configured it or what settings I have enabled.

                              <span>Hi there! 
 I have some org mode files containing denote notes for a bunch of papers that I would like to read, which each live in the root of my notes directory and have the tags _paper and _unread in their filenames.
 I would like to put a link in another org file (not a note) that would take me straight to a filtered dired view showing only these files.
 Has anyone achieved something like this, or do you have opinions about the best way to do it?

                              <span>I use a synced init.el on different machines. I do use eglot as language server which is started via hock in python-mode. But I want not to start it when it runs on a specific machine (maybe identified via host-name?).
 This is the relevant part of my init.el.
 (use-package eglot :bind (:map eglot-mode-map (&quot;C-c a r&quot; . #&#x27;eglot-rename)) :custom (eglot-autoshutdown t) (flymake-no-changes-timeout 5) ) (use-package python :ensure nil ; in-build! :hook (python-mode . eglot-ensure) :custom (python-shell-interpreter &quot;python3&quot;) ) 
 I would assume it is the best to not activate the hook on a special condition?
 Pseudocode:
 (use-package python :hook (if host-name no &quot;quark&quot; then python-mode . eglot-ensure) ) 
 I have no idea how to solve that in Emacs Lisp.

I’m going to be a tax preparer, not a coder or anything. I find eMacs too bulky for my use case of just taking notes, but I’m still curious, I’ve heard it’s basically a separate operating system. So, what are your favorite things to use eMacs for (besides programming)?

                              <span>A whole 3 years ago my Emacs newbie frustrations led me to post Is elisp documentation going to get the equivalent of the user contributed notes at php.net?.
 The top comments were about the problems at the PHP site, so please read past them.
 I just looked at the shortdocs examples in Emacs and I see how define-short-documentation-group can be a great help if shortdocs are developed and shared collaboratively.
 All you have to do is to visit the site, browse them, select those you want, download and incorporate them into your system, and add yours if you consider them superior.
 If there is some voting the best groups in each set rise to the top to make it easier.
 Is the FSF going provide some infrastructure for this, or will it have to be Github or Gitlab?

                              <span>The title should be: How can I use emacs to indicate duplicated declaratives (AUCTeX)
 I use Emacs mostly for LaTeX. I would like Emacs to indicat lines where multiple usepackage commands with the same package in a project are used or at least in the same file; either using \usepackge[...]{...} or \RequirePackage[...]{...}. Does anyone know of there is any package for that?
 Currently, I test files using Python script because I am total noob at ELisp. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using pdf-tools (pdf-view-mode) and I only now realized, there&#x27;s no simple way of knowing the current position in the document. scroll-bar-mode when enabled, doesn&#x27;t show it. There&#x27;s no indication in the mode-line. Opening pdf-outline doesn&#x27;t navigate to the current section, besides, some documents don&#x27;t even have an outline. what-cursor-position says it&#x27;s on point 1.
 So how do I get to know where am I in a book?

Intro: best game meets best editor
 Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is a turn-based strategy game released in 1999 that is still has an active multiplayer scene. It is the #1 turn-based strategy videogame of all time, according to Ranker.
 HoMM3 is a superb game for demonstrating iterative strategy refinement and documentation writing using Emacs Org Mode, because of HoMM3&#x27;s ergonomic hotkeys and autosaves.
 HoMM3&#x27;s hotkeys are honed by the multiplayer community, which plays timed turns, as in speed chess. The HD+ Launcher makes daily saves in tournament mode, allowing one to revert to any previous day. This is primitive version control for text, but excellent for a videogame.

                              <span>Does anyone have any elisp or package recommendations on calculating lead and cycle time for todo items? I&#x27;d like to also include estimate vs actual effort. 
 I&#x27;d like to be able to review a list of tasks (buffer only or across multiple files) to determine the difference between when they were created, time to completion, and time active (in a certain state). I&#x27;d like to leverage :LOGBOOK: properties. 
 My goal is as part of a weekly review see where my time got chewed up, refine my estimates of effort and become more efficent with my planning. Ideally I&#x27;ll extend this to include tags so I can add another layer like &quot;how long is it taking me to get to items tagged :admin: on average&quot;. 
 I&#x27;m new to elisp and happy trying to work on it myself but some tips or starting points of the best way to address the problem would be appreciated! 
 Example:
 * DONE An important task CLOSED: [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] :PROPERTIES: :Effort: 0:30 :END: :LOGBOOK: - State &quot;DONE&quot; from &quot;TODO&quot; [2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] CLOCK: [2022-05-20 Fri 10:00]--[2022-05-20 Fri 10:15] &#x3D;&gt; 0:15 CLOCK: [2022-05-22 Sun 19:30]--[2022-05-22 Sun 20:00] &#x3D;&gt; 0:30 - State &quot;TODO&quot; from [2022-05-15 Sun 20:00] :END: * Report | Task | Effort | Clocked | Missed | Lead Time | Cycle Time | |-------------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------+------------| | An important task | 0:30 | 0:45 | -00:15 | 7d | 1d |

                              <span>Current process: I&#x27;ve been using neovim for the past 6 years or so. Python coder 99% of the time, but I also dabble in rust, haskell, c++, and occasionally others. I&#x27;m relatively minimalist, I like to implement things myself if they&#x27;re simple, and I&#x27;d rather have 90% of the functionality of something if it means having 1 less plugin. I am a machine learning/signal processing researcher, so my code is very exploratory, and often not huge projects/codebases. My current setup is I have a lot of custom functionality to split my window in half left/right with a terminal or python/ipython REPL on the right side, and keymaps to send code, run the current file, compile, etc. Plots appear as pop ups, and when I close them they are gone unless I explicitly save them (or rerun the code).

                              <span>I found this in Eric Schulte&#x27;s &quot;Scraps&quot; which is a big org file full of babel block examples of all sorts. Here&#x27;s one that has me confused
 #+name: clean #+begin_src emacs-lisp :var in&#x3D;&quot;&quot; (flet ((clean (in) (if (listp in) (mapcar #&#x27;clean in) (if (stringp in) (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;¦&quot; &quot;|&quot; in) in)))) (clean in)) #+end_src #+name: regexps | first | (a¦b) | | second | (1¦2) | #+begin_src perl :var a&#x3D;clean(in&#x3D;regexps)[0,1] :var b&#x3D;clean(in&#x3D;regexps)[1,1] $a; $b; #+end_src #+name: : (1|2) 
 I&#x27;ve read flet is deprecated for being dynamic-global and not lexical -- or because cl is deprecated. Obviously, in the end it&#x27;s just replacing ¦ for |, but how can this be redone for these &quot;modern&quot; lexical times? In general, where can I learn modern lexical, cl-* oriented elisp? Pre- and post-lexical is confusing.

Of course this breaks basically every package, and makes my emacs workflow unusable. I&#x27;m very confused how this could&#x27;ve happened though, as I thought this was a core emacs function. Does anyone know what I should do? Wipe and reinstall emacs?

 #+ATTR_HTML: :class LookupTable #+NAME: Functions and Docstrings #+include: ./funcstable 
 The org-babel is like this.

 How can I convert it to a noweb system so the HTML block looks like this (assuming it is the right syntax)

                              <span>I would like to scroll left the buffer by a specific number of characters, no matter the zoom.
 (scroll-left 10)
 would scroll left by 10 chars, but only if the current text scale is 0. If I zoom in with C-x + / (text-scale-adjust)), then the same command would scroll less than 10 chars.
 I might be terribly wrong, but from this I infer that scroll-left&#x27;s argument is not the amount of characters. Indeed, the documentation says scroll-left&#x27;s argument 
  
Value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in effect after the change.
  
This begs the question: how can I scroll left 10 chars, regardless the current text scale?
 I tried playing with text-scale-mode-amount and text-scale-mode-step, miserably failing.
 Any hint? Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying out consult and am really enjoying it. However, as usual, there are always some adjustments to be done. In particular, I can&#x27;t seem to be comfortable with the behavior of consult-line. By default, it lists the candidates from point on, and candidates above point in the buffer are listed below, after the end of buffer one. This seems odd to me (or my preferences), and I&#x27;d like the search in the minibuffer to mirror the actual buffer: what is above is above, what is below is below. There exists the option consult-line-start-from-top, which I tried, and indeed organizes things this way. However, it also starts the search from beginning of buffer, which is not quite what I&#x27;d want. In the consult wiki there exists a snippet which produces the desired effect for consult-outline and co…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m perennially confused about use-package declarations and keywords, but what I want to do is the following:
  
  
Defer a package e.g. citar so that it doesn&#x27;t load at init time (but the function definitions are known).
 When I do call the package, it loads the other packages as well, i.e. citar also loads citar-org-roam and the associated :config setup.
  
 
 Here is what I have now:
 (use-package citar :ensure t :defer t :custom ... ) (use-package citar-org-roam :ensure t :diminish t :after citar org-roam :no-require :custom (citar-org-roam-subdir nil) :config (citar-org-roam-mode) ...) 
  
 Is the right answer to use :requires citar-org-roam in the first citar macro?
  
  
 
 I am trying to speed up my init time, which was on the order of 20s, and now is around 9s, by deferring/lazy-loading some packages. I use Emacs in daemon/server-client mode anyway, so I don&#x27;t need superfast init times, but small changes help.

                              <span>hi everybody, 
 I am learning Japanese and I am tired of having to switch input-method in the OS (linux and MacOS) and then switch back to be able to run any emacs command. As long as I am typing Japanese the OS method works well, but the moment I want to run a Ctrl- or M- command, the moment I have to swich OS input method.
 So I noticed that toggle-input-method seems allows japanese input while allowing romaji commands without switching.
 If you use emacs for Japanese, what is your recommendation regarding Japanese input? Should I stick with the OS one, or use one of the many Japanese input-methods?
 Basically, I am looking for advice from people who have to deal with Japanese within emacs.
 thank you in advance,

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to finish setting up emacs for Java dev since I go back to college tomorrow. I&#x27;m experiencing an issue where it seems that my jdtls hangs at the starting process, as I open a .java file, enter M-x &#x27;lsp&#x27;, and then the the client tries connecting to the server to no end, saying it&#x27;s &quot;starting&quot;. Anybody got any solutions?

                              <span>Hello,
 I took just a couple minutes to scratch an itch I&#x27;ve had for a while now. I find my org agendas growing too large sometimes. I hesitate to remove things from my schedule because I don&#x27;t want to forget them. But sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to see it RIGHT NOW.
 Enter dired. I love dired-do-kill-lines to pare down my directory listings as I work on them.
 In the same spirit, I wrote the following (naive) function for getting rid of lines in the org-agenda.
 (defun alec-org-agenda-kill-line () &quot;Kills a line from an org agenda, like &#x60;dired-kill-line&#x27;. It does so naively, so be careful using this!&quot; (interactive) (read-only-mode -1) (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) (delete-char 1) (read-only-mode 1)) (define-key org-agenda-keymap (kbd &quot;M-k&quot;) #&#x27;alec-org-agenda-kill-line) 
 I&#x27;ve used it a bit and love it so far. For now I&#x27;ve just got this function for killing one line at a time. If I decide I want this to stay in my workflow, next comes more things &quot;inspired&quot; (copied) from dired like regexp marking and killing. Feedback welcome!

                              <span>202301041111 Making family podcast with kids
#podcast #children #memorabilia
Make a podcast with kids: maybe share with the family, but not public.
Then you have memories to look back on later as the kids grow up. Meanwhile, the family has something to listen to once in a while without needing to visit. This could e.g. keep grandparents that don&#x27;t live nearby in touch with their grandchildren, and a kind of conversation going. (Depends on the age of the child.)
Ideas for topics:
what questions (about life, the world) do you want answered?
what happened last week/month?
what are you playing right now?
just: what&#x27;s on your mind? -- free form talk
Idea from this story:

  
When my daughter was 8 we made a six episode podcast together just talking about stuff. We didn&#x27;t keep going, but revisiting the episodes is so nice. A couple of episodes had her 4 year old siblings too and hearing their tiny little voices and enthusiastic stuttering is bringing us joy.
I&#x27;m glad we did it, and I am now wishing we had more of these sorts of memories.

@nighthawk it was just at an age where they had heaps of questions and I could explain stuff to the best of my knowledge. We sat down and wrote down a bunch of questions on cards and then picked a card for each episode.

                              <span>I thought folks around here might enjoy seeing how the chat gpt ai responded when I asked it describe a zettelkasten.  Here it is without modification.

  
Describe a zettelkasten.
The zettelkasten system was developed by the German sociologist and philosopher Niklas Luhmann, who used it to store and organize his notes and ideas as he wrote and researched. The name &quot;zettelkasten&quot; comes from the German word &quot;zettel,&quot; which means &quot;slip,&quot; and &quot;kasten,&quot; which means &quot;box.&quot;
In a zettelkasten, each note is given a unique identification number and can be linked to other notes through the use of cross-references. This allows for the creation of a web of interconnected ideas that can be easily navigated and explored.
The zettelkasten system has gained popularity in recent years as a tool for organizing and managing knowledge, particularly among writers and researchers. It is seen as a way to facilitate creative thinking and problem-solving by allowing for the easy access and retrieval of ideas and information.</span>

                              <span>I have a file with several headlines, ie projects. Each project have several subtasks and during the day I clock time spent on each task. At the end of the day, I would like to create a clocktable depicting the time I spent doing these tasks (tasks that belong to different headlines in the file). I thought :scope file or :scope agenda would create such an overview on what I have spent my time on during the day. But I dont get it to work. The clock table only depict time spent on subtasks belonging to that particular headline.

                              <span>Hello,
 I took just a couple minutes to scratch an itch I&#x27;ve had for a while now. I find my agendas growing too large sometimes. I hesitate to remove things from my schedule because I don&#x27;t want to forget them. But sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to see it RIGHT NOW.
 Enter dired. I love dired-do-kill-lines to pare down my directory listings as I work on them. 
 In the same spirit, I wrote the following (naive) function for getting rid of lines in the org-agenda. 
 (defun alec-org-agenda-kill-line () &quot;Kills a line from an org agenda, like &#x60;dired-kill-line&#x27;. It does so naively, so be careful using this!&quot; (interactive) (read-only-mode -1) (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) (delete-char 1) (read-only-mode 1)) (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd &quot;M-k&quot;) #&#x27;alec-org-agenda-kill-line) 
 I&#x27;ve used it a bit and love it so far. For now I&#x27;ve just got this defun for killing one line at a time. If I decide I want this to stay in my workflow, next comes more things &quot;inspired&quot; (copied) from dired like regexp marking and killing. Feedback welcome!

 What I found out that works is to create org-export-filter-final-output-functions text filter (see below), but I somehow think there could be simplier solution.
 (require &#x27;ox-publish) (defun org-html-remove-spurious-dynamic-block-code (string backend info) &quot;Remove #+BEGIN: columnview...&quot; (when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend &#x27;html) (string-match &quot;.\+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local :skip-empty-rows t&quot; string)) (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;.\+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local :skip-empty-rows t&quot; &quot;&quot; string))) (add-to-list &#x27;org-export-filter-final-output-functions &#x27;org-html-remove-spurious-dynamic-block-code)

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to see the flymake + eglot messages in the same time in the echo area.
 what I setup:
 &#x27;(eldoc-documentation-strategy &#x27;eldoc-documentation-compose)
 &#x27;(eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p t)
 the &quot;eldoc-documentation-functions&quot;: &#x27;(eglot-signature-eldoc-function eglot-hover-eldoc-function flymake-eldoc-function)
 I don&#x27;t see the result of the flymake-eldoc-function.
 What is wrong with this setting ?
 How to use the eldoc-documentation-compose ?

 Besides Irreal, Sacha Chua, System Crafters and Prot, what good rss feeds have you in your library that deal with emacs? Is there a collection of such feeds somewhere?
 Thanks for sharing

 I discovered embark, and it&#x27;s a great package. The only problem is that I don&#x27;t find it ergonomic. So I want to put the most used commands in the right place. The only problem is that I haven&#x27;t used embark enough to know what are the most important commands.
 Did someone by chance use, for example keyfreq, with embark for a while? 
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>Does anyone have any advice as to how to easily leverage any sort of concurrency in elisp?
 To be more specific, I periodically do a package list refresh and reload and my underyling package tech is straight.el. Even with the git commits for each repo limited to only 3 the process of pulling and applying updates locks up my emacs session for several minutes at a time. ( Let&#x27;s not talk about the complexity of my .emacs, mkay? ;) ) I&#x27;m hoping that I can defun a local function that might wrap that process up in some form of concurrency so I don&#x27;t have to go make coffee when I&#x27;m doing an Emacs package update.
 I&#x27;ve looked at just scheduling the refresh via midnight-mode but I don&#x27;t really want to make updates that frequently. I&#x27;ve also looked at idle timers but I don&#x27;t see a way to make the straight.el pulls pre-emptible and once the timer trips you are then along for the ride until the process completes. Lastly, I&#x27;ve looked into aio but I&#x27;m not good enough with elisp/maybe not smart enough to understand that API.
 Thoughts? Advice?

                              <span>Hi all! 
 I have been using eglot (built-in LSP client implementation) for a long time now, but recently have started to think about DAP, the debugger protocol. My workflow at work would be to write most if not all my code in Emacs, but when debugging, I would turn to Intellij.
 This is mostly because there is no built-in implementation of the DAP protocol in Emacs. Yes, there&#x27;s dap-mode, but it&#x27;s so strongly connected to lsp-mode that there have been multiple instances in time where people have shown interest in having DAP connected to eglot, the efforts have gone nowhere. 
 I&#x27;m not interested in starting a war between lsp-mode and eglot users, but as an eglot user myself, I would love to see these two communities work together to have a working and built-in solution. 
 Thank you all!

                              <span>Hello guys,
 I am struggling connecting to Libera chat server using VPN.
 Without VPN, I can log in automatically but if VPN is running, connexion is denied and I get an sasl error:
 -copper.libera.chat- *** Notice -- SASL authentication to a NickServ account with a verified email address is required to connect from your current network. Please seehttps://libera.chat/guides/sasl for configuration assistance.
 &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; ERROR from irc.libera.chat: Closing Link: gateway/vpn/protonvpn/account (SASL
 authentication to a NickServ account with a verified email address is required
 to connect from your current network. Please see https://libera.chat/guides/sasl
 for configuration assistance.)
 Connection failed! Re-establishing connection...
 So I read the specified Libera page but since I am using Doom Emacs, I really don&#x27;t to make this works.
 If I try to use the &#x27;(require erc-sasl), I got an error: file not found.
 Anyone can guide me through the right process, please?

                              <span>Hey, emacs noob here. &quot;treesit-install-language-grammar&quot; calls &quot;treesit--install-language-grammar-1&quot; which says that it creates the &quot;tree-sitter&quot; directory under the user&#x27;s emacs configuration directory if it doesn&#x27;t exist. However I didn&#x27;t see it do that, and I can&#x27;t see the code where it allegedly does that.
 Is this a bug? How can I report it?

                              <span>I&#x27;m still pretty new so maybe this is a dumb question - but I want to lmap over an ExceptT. Something like:
 lamp :: forall e e&#x27; m a . Functor m &#x3D;&gt; (e -&gt; e&#x27;) -&gt; ExceptT e m a -&gt; ExceptT e&#x27; m a lamp f ex &#x3D; ExceptT $ (lmap f)  runExceptT ex 
 Should I just leave it like this and use as a standalone function? Is it more normal to write the whole Bifunctor instance when you need it for a less common monad? Wouldn&#x27;t I get an orphaned instance error if I tried to define this instance since I cannot add code to ExceptT nor Bifunctor libs?

                              <span>Hi people,
 in Scala cats effect, lets say I have a function that takes an integer and returns its double. I want to write a functional program that calls this function and prints to the console the return value. More precisely I have the following simple code:
 def f(x: Int): Int &#x3D; 2 * x def program: IO[Unit] &#x3D; { val y &#x3D; f(2) // 4 IO(println(s&quot;result is $y&quot;)) // println has side effects } 
 My goal is make the program as generic as possible like the following:
 def program[F[_]]: F[Unit] &#x3D; { val y &#x3D; f(2) F(println(s&quot;result is $y&quot;)) } // won&#x27;t compile, what is F? 
 however of course this will not compile because is generic and we do not now what is F(something). How can specify some behavior on F and what should that be behavior be ?
 ​
 Many thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a GHC plugin that lets you take things like the following code:
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;Which argument would you like to print?&quot; index &lt;- fmap read getLine arg &lt;- fmap (!! index) getArgs putStrLn arg 
 and instead write this code:
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn &quot;Which argument would you like to print?&quot; putStrLn $ !getArgs !! read !getLine 
 This is heavily inspired by Idris&#x27;s !-notation, the main difference being that this plugin only allows you to use ! inside of existing do-blocks, whereas Idris will insert a do if it doesn&#x27;t exist.
 It currently works with ghc 9.4. You can find it here:
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monadic-bang-0.1.0.0
 Please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think!

                              <span>This is a follow up question from my earlier post that I hope can be answered separately without needing the complication of my earlier post.
 I got type M s &#x3D; ReaderT (PuzzleState s) (ST s), and a function canSolve :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; M s Bool. In that function:
 case () of _ | assigned -&gt; if sumDigit &#x3D;&#x3D; i then canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry &#x60;div&#x60; 10) else return False 
 The above works, but this doesn&#x27;t:
 fmap (sumDigit &#x3D;&#x3D; i &amp;&amp;) $ canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry &#x60;div&#x60; 10) 
 This doesn&#x27;t work either.
 pure (sumDigit &#x3D;&#x3D; i &amp;&amp;)  canSolve 0 (col + 1) (carry &#x60;div&#x60; 10) 
 Both the expressions produce wrong recursion result. Why?

                              <span>I am looking for a PostgreSQL only database library that can be easily used by Haskell beginner. It is not for me specifically but few of the college undergraduate students I intend to mentor. They would be building a typical multi-tenancy system, so you can expect typical, &#x60;tenant&#x60;, &#x60;user&#x60;, &#x60;emails&#x60;, &#x60;clients&#x60;, etc. kind of models/tables. And of course, the application domain entities.
 Avoiding the cost of learning EDSL that many Haskell DB libraries provide, I found out that only postgresql-typed and postgresql-simple allow to write only raw SQL queries easily. As I extensively use pgtyped for production Node.js application, I am thinking about using postgresql-typed. While I could find many resources for postgresql-simple, the same cannot be said try for postgresql-typed.
 I was able to get running with postgresql-typed and execute typical CRUD operations, but I fear that it may not support few of the important PostgreSQL constructs down the line. Also, the database must exist at the time of compilation of the project which is different from pgtyped as it generates TypeScript files at development time which we commit in the repository. I also get the feeling that after a while compilation time could increase exponentially as more queries gets added. I am already counting 50+ queries (Good thing is that the queries are not dynamic).
 So, my questions are:
  
Are my concerns valid about using postgresql-typed? (Slow compilations, need for DB at compile time, etc.)
 Lack of literature/articles around it? (Building own connection pool abstraction, etc.)
 Or any other recommendation? (Sticking to plain SQL and not EDSL)
  
​
 P.S - Kindly redirect me to right forum if this is not a right place. I am just a trespasser in a Haskell community :D

Which tablets do you use for those purposes and integration?
Thank you very much!

 is is possible for Enter to open the current headline when you are in normal evil mode?
 In normal mode Enter does nothing, so I suppose one could remap it without risk?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 im starting out with org-mode and want code-blocks to be syntax-highlighted.
 On my system that works for some languages (e.g. python) but does not work for others (e.g. kotlin).
 What do I need to install and/or configure to get syntax-highlighting for kotlin?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I wonder how you guys think intuitively about fs2 streams with an effect F of the form fs2.Stream[F, Int]. From my understanding, F could be the IO monad of cats effect. But I can&#x27;t make sense of how IO is related to the stream. 
 Appreciate any hint :)

                              <span>lsp+dap mode works pretty well on very simple projects, I was able to lunch it and add breakpoints for main code. But I&#x27;m not able to configure dap for tests. With VSCode it&#x27;s only a couple mouse clicks, but when I run dap-debug-edit-template it give me this strange struct
 (dap-register-debug-template &quot;Test function&quot; (list :type &quot;go&quot; :request &quot;launch&quot; :name &quot;Test function&quot; :mode &quot;test&quot; :program nil :args nil :env nil)) 
 I have no idea what all these properties means and where are no documentation or examples about them. I was no able to find articles in medium or youtube videos, like this how to debug go tests in emacs with dap mode. My working project has very strange, legacy structure and dap give me Warning (emacs): Initialize request failed: Failed to launch error message.
 Please share your configuration or at least explain what all these properties means.

                              <span>Previously, when I used to use projectile-find-file, the choices I used to get were based on files in my git repo. I installed ivy-prescient do that my counsel-M-x will list recently used commands as first choices (instead of alphabetical sorting initially), but now, projectile-find-file shows me all files under project root, including build artifacts, which takes a noticeably longer time to build the list before I can start entering my substring of interest.
 I tried to look through projectile options, as well as prescient options, but could not find anything that can help me limit projectile-find-file to just git-ls files. Does anyone have experience with this?

The breadcrumbs work fine with doom-modeline disabled and doom-modeline works fine in LSP mode with breadcrumbs disabled. Using them both causes the UI to freeze. Any way to get both working?

                              <span>I have released a slightly updated version of labrat, a simple command-line program for printing labels with little cermony and that can be invoked from within Emacs or from a shell.
 You can read about it and how to install it on github here.
 This is from the README:
 
  
Motivation
  
I need to print labels. And in my case, mostly I need file folder labels. I typically want to print to a Dymo LabelWriter, of which I own several variants. The problem is that I work almost entirely in Linux, but the simple task of printing a file folder label has required opening a GUI application, such as the very fine glabels, or worse, switching to a machine running Windows or to a Mac to run Dymo’s proprietary GUI. The Dymo GUI is particularly irksome because it takes a long time to start up and demands that you register every time you open it.
 I wanted a way to print a file label from the command line, or even better, from within my editor, Emacs. After giving up looking for such a thing without success, I decided to write my own. Hence labrat. With it—after due configuration—printing a file folder label is as simple as:
 $ labrat &#x27;First Line of Label--&gt;And the Second Line&#x27;
 Or, you can preview the label in your previewer of choice (mine is qpdfview) by adding the -V flag:
 $ labrat -V &#x27;First Line of Label--&gt;And the Second Line&#x27;
 Even better, I have included with labrat an elisp file (labrat.el) that will invoke labrat to form a label with the text of the paragraph at or before point. So within Emacs, you can bind keys to the commands, labrat-print and labrat-view to print or view the current or prior paragraph as your default label. Thus, in Emacs, I have C-z C-l C-l bound to labrat-print and C-z C-l C-v to labrat-view, and I can type a label in any buffer and get it generated with very little ceremony.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;m very new to Emacs, and I would want to learn it well from scratch and make it my own (instead of going for a ready option like Doom) write my own elisp, etc. Before then I&#x27;ve been using vim plugins on a various editors (Atom, Sublime Text, VSCode, AstroNvim config).
 Since I&#x27;m more of a vim motions user, I don&#x27;t want to bother myself with default Emacs keybindings that I&#x27;m going to change anyway. What is the best way to learn Emacs for such case? 
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>I am trying to setup a note-making system with Emacs+org-mode. 
 I have already set up a MediaWiki installation for note-making. Here is a view of categories, subcategories and wiki page. It&#x27;s very easy to navigate to any page I want by traversing the category tree. Organically, the categories and subcategories evolve over time. A wiki page can be under multiple (sub) categories.
 Category Tree in MediaWiki
 But installing MediaWiki means I need webserver+php+mysql stack, which I want to avoid if possible. If I have to backup, replicate, migrate, and update MediaWiki to a new machine it&#x27;s not going to be easy. On top of this MediaWiki wiki syntax also sucks. Despite all these headaches, I still see this setup as valuable for providing me with category tree navigation and knowledge hierarchy.
 I know there is org-roam but it&#x27;s not providing me these kind of dynamic category trees and allow a page to have multiple parents. For me these category hierarchies are more important than back links.
 I can use projectile + nested folders but I want the ability to one sub category available under multiple parent category. Creating and managing symlinks may work but it won&#x27;t scale if I have 300+ wiki pages which should be filed under multiple parent categories.
 MediaWiki also provides a breadcrumb of clickable category links like below:
 Wiki &gt; Subjects &gt; Computer Science &gt; Programming Languages &gt; Clojure
 Is it possible to achieve 
  
similar Category hierarchy, 
 navigable dynamic category tree and
 multi-parent subcategories (i.e a category or page can belong to multiple parent categories)
  
any ideas/pointers to solve this with Emacs?

                              <span>Hi everyone. I started learning haskell about 4 months ago and have been mostly using interactive and/or turning into binary using stack. I have been following a course offered by the university of helsinki which uses stack for mostly running standalone programs. I am now undertaking my first project on haskell and wanted to know which package manager I should start with - stack or cabal. Since I am starting out, I want to do it right. I am also interested in being a cardano developer and they mostly use cabal and nix (not sure what nix is) as far as I know therefore, would like to think about that too. Please tell me which is better as a beginner.
 Cheers.

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/socks, which is quite old, we use it now, but it doesn&#x27;t support SOCKS authentication that we now need to support.
 https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-simpl, that seems even older, and seems like it&#x27;s not supporting authentication too...
  
Is there a decent SOCKS5 library with authentication support?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve a strange problem. I modified some code with a continuation (where the input parameter is a class), but the code now forces the type within the continuation. And it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 My example reduces to (this is not the real example)
 ​
 oldFunction :: Num n &#x3D;&gt; (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int oldFunction f n &#x3D; f (n + 1) 
 compiles
 newFunction :: Num n &#x3D;&gt; (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int newFunction f n &#x3D; f (floor n + 1 :: Int) 
 Doesn&#x27;t.
 It wants f to be of type Int -&gt; Int. I am surprised. I though the callee decided on the instance of the typeclass. If a f can take a Num it could take a Int . What am I missing ?
 (here is the full error)
 old.hs:5:22: error: • Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘n’ with actual type ‘Int’ ‘n’ is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for: newFunction :: forall n. Num n &#x3D;&gt; (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int at old.hs:4:1-46 • In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘(floor n + 1 :: Int)’ In the expression: f (floor n + 1 :: Int) In an equation for ‘newFunction’: newFunction f n &#x3D; f (floor n + 1 :: Int) • Relevant bindings include n :: n (bound at old.hs:5:15) f :: n -&gt; Int (bound at old.hs:5:13) newFunction :: (n -&gt; Int) -&gt; n -&gt; Int (bound at old.hs:5:1) | 5 | newFunction f n &#x3D; f (floor n + 1 :: Int) | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Failed, no modules loaded.

 I am experienced in typescript and new to haskell. Had this thought today. Perhaps satisfies wouldn&#x27;t serve much use in haskell without subtyping, although maybe there are cases where type classes include each other and this could be useful. Interested to learn.

                              <span>Total beginner here, coming from imperative languages like c, python and have some basic familiarity of functional paradigm side from Javascript land but I wanted to get good at data structures and algorithms and I think functional paradigm will allow me to focus on actual complexity of algorithms rather than getting bogged down with imperative details. So I wanted to know if learning Haskell will help me do that as I am also learning rust but wanted to thoroughly understand functional logics in Haskell first (since its more expressive) than go implement functional style in rust.

And I cannot wait😁 To me any form of organization of stuff I recorded (notes, zettels) seemed futile, at least brittle. At least for long term use.
But I‘m sure, AI will help. It‘s a great area of application. Mem is already trying. More will follow.
Until then I‘ll just patiently record in a simple way whatever I find valuable. The current tool is not important, eg Roam or Obsidian or Mem or Notion. In the end the content can be either used across tools or exported so the AI can process it.</span>

                              <span>So as I&#x27;ve been doing some searching, looks like Haskell has a steep initial learning curve but gets easier later vs other languages which might have a simple curve initially but get more difficult later.
 Where is the point of intersection usually? At the 6 month mark? 1 year? 2? Certainly it may be subjective depending on what one finds difficult or tedious but aiming for a generalization here.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I think state machines of the type Input -&gt; State -&gt; (State, Output) are great. They are easy to reason about, and if run on a separate thread with access to a queue of Inputs they perform well too.
 Sometimes the state machine might need to do some blocking I/O before producing the output though, this slows down the processing of inputs.
 I&#x27;ve recently implemented and documented an experimental way of how we can write the state machine as if the I/O is blocking, but actually it&#x27;s non-blocking and inputs can continue to be processes while we wait for the I/O action to complete:

 I am looking for a light theme for org that
 - uses a white background (not some kind of gray)
 - does not use green text
 - is installable via use-package
 - uses monospace in code-blocks
 - has nice tables 
 Does such a unicorn exist?
 Many thanks!

 From what I&#x27;ve gathered from searching the web, it is not possible to add recurring tasks with a finishing date (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). So I was wondering how do you deal with this scenario, which I think is fairly common. Thanks in advance for all your help.

 I have not used orgmode for some time, but one of my new year&#x27;s resolutions is to orgmodify my life.
 As I have recently started to get into android/wearos programming, I need to collect a lot kotlin code-snippets, each possibly with extra-information on what to put into gradle-files and what sdk-version to use etc etc.
 Any tips on how to best organize that?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hey all!
 ​
 Edit: I tried solving this by adding an autoload to &#x60;smudge-connect-player-status&#x60; which seems to have possibly fixed THIS issue, but there is another problem with Oauth that makes the whole thing hang and I&#x27;m not sure.
 I&#x27;m using Pop! OS, with Emacs installed from terminal, emacs 27.1.
 I posted a few months ago about getting Vuiet set up. I liked it a lot, but it was very minimalistic. Really only good for mindlessly playing a handful of tracks, and at that, you kinda had to know who you were looking for. It also had a few weaknesses, like constantly throwing up my debugger every time a particular song&#x27;s lyrics couldn&#x27;t be found.
 I finally gave in and switched to Spotify from YT Music since my partner uses it, and also I discovered Smudge, which looks awesome!
 ​
 Thing is, it doesn&#x27;t actually work, because some functions are not defined yet. Something something spacemacs lazy loading. I&#x27;m not sure how to fix this but I know Spacemacs has some behavior which causes packages to not be completely loaded if they&#x27;re not invoked - I think somehow this is what&#x27;s causing the issue.
 So, I try to run: &#x60;global-smudge-remote-mode&#x60;
 This is the output:
 &#x60;smudge-connect-player-status&#x60; not defined.
 Any attempt to run another smudge function then causes emacs to hang indefinitely and it must be killed (That&#x27;s dangerous!!!)
 I also noticed that when I first launch emacs, I only have access to functions which are defined in &#x60;smudge.el&#x60;, not ANY of the dozen or so other .el files included with this repository.
 Only smudge.el functions on startup.
 So I&#x27;m hoping this is a relatively simple configuration change I need to make in order to load this package properly and prevent the crashes. Thanks everyone!!!

                              <span>I have a problem. I have a .org file full of headers. I want to include non-header plaintext at the very end. However, that plaintext is automatically absorbed into the last header. How do I separate that plaintext so it appears on its own?
 Example:
 *Header1
 *Header2
 *Header3
 [Plain Text that I don&#x27;t want falling under Header3]
 Thank you!

                              <span>In exwm, I often start up one sub-emacs process, using M-&amp; emacs. Most often this is for running my Telega. In every case, the buffer names of this sub-emacs process is &quot;E: &quot;, where that BUFFER-NAME is changes to whatever buffer is being visited in the sub-emacs at this time.
 Now, my goal is to have a key that will switch-buffer to that sub-emacs process whatever it is running, optionally starting the process if it hasn&#x27;t begun yet. What is the best way to switch to my &quot;E:.*&quot; buffer?

                              <span>I mainly write code in Common Lisp. 99% of the time, I have two screens with my window manager:
  
Window 1 - Emacs
 Window 2 - Kitty Terminal with Tmux
  
In my Emacs frame. It is split into 3. On the left I have 2 panes with code and on the right I have the repl.
 This setup is fixed. As in, it doesnt really change much. 
 I use the terminal heavily for a bunch of coding and non-coding things while I am coding. Having the terminal on a separate window is very quick for me to switch and do something.
 I am curious what other peoples terminal workflow is. How do you integrate the terminal into your workflow? If you use term or v-term, how do you make switching easy and seemless?

                              <span>Hi all - pretty new to emacs and emacs org-mode and hoping this is some silly thing that will have a quick fix. I&#x27;ve searched every way I know how here and elsewhere and cannot find a solution to this.
 I&#x27;m trying to set up per-file key words for an org-mode file and I keep getting an invalid read syntax error. This is what I have at the top of the file along with title/author
 #+TODO: TODO CANCELED | PENDING DONE
 The error: Invalid read syntax: &quot;#&quot;, 1, 1

                              <span>Sorry for the dummy question, I&#x27;m new to emacs and could not solve my doubts by looking at the docs.
 I&#x27;m trying to set a variable in a project dir-locals.el file, to configure projectile&#x27;s behavior.
 I reduced the content of dir-locals.el to a single line, this one:
 (setq projectile-project-run-cmd &#x27;(docker-compose up -d)) 
 But when entering the project, I always see the error message:
 Directory-local variables error: (wrong-type-argument listp projectile-project-run-cmd) 
 ​
 What am I doing wrong?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Is there a how to anywhere on how to setup web-mode with laravel/php and blade?
 I can&#x27;t seem to get it to work correctly. The syntax highlighting is all off.
 It does not seem to respect &quot;@php&quot; / &quot;@endphp&quot; and all other blade tags. 
 When I set the web-mode engine to php it only works if I use the &quot;&lt;?php&quot; tags.

                              <span>I just bought Galaxy Tab S8+. Great device, but I want my Org-Roam notes on it. I figured the best option is to get Emacs up and running, and it&#x27;s been a bit difficult. Tried Andronix/F-Droid/Termux option, attempted multiple times with Arch and Debian with various desktop manager options and failed.
 Do you guys run Emacs on Android? And I don&#x27;t mean just in terminal. I want a full-blown GUI that supports all the things Emacs 29 has - sqlite, etc. Is that possible or I just want too much?

                              <span>Here are a few light-hearted jokes that you could share with an Emacs user:
 &quot;Why did the Emacs user switch to Vim? Because they wanted to be able to exit the editor.&quot;
 &quot;Why was the Emacs user upset when they lost their cursor? Because they couldn&#x27;t find their point.&quot;
 &quot;Why was the Emacs user excited about the new release of their editor? Because it had a cut and paste feature.&quot;
 &quot;Why was the Emacs user upset when their editor crashed? Because they lost all their parenthesis.&quot;
 I hope these jokes bring a smile to your friend&#x27;s face! Just be sure to keep in mind that everyone has different senses of humor, so it&#x27;s important to be mindful of your friend&#x27;s feelings and to not overstep any boundaries.

                              <span>This has annoyed me for quite some time now and I&#x27;ve never found any solutions for it online. I&#x27;m using lsp-mode for C/C++, and I have some dependencies specified in a CMakeLists.txt.
 The problem: Emacs keeps complaining (I think it&#x27;s the language-server who is complaining about this?) about c-headers for the dependencies specified in CMakeLists.txt not being found.
 The solution I&#x27;ve been using so far is to manually put the include paths to these dependencies in a compile_flags.txt file. For example:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -std&#x3D;gnu99 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I./include
 Deps produced by cmake
 -I./build/_deps/webp-src/src -I./build/_deps/vec3_static-src/include -I./build/_deps/cglm-src/include &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 However, it&#x27;s kind of annoying to keep fiddling with these files all the time. Is there anyway to configure lsp-mode or whoever is complaining about missing C-headers to actually look inside the _deps folder created by cmake, without using a compile_flags.txt?
 Like a global system-wide compile_flags.txt ?
 Thanks!

 I can C-g and C-k and C-c C-c C-c. I cannot kill it on a boat, I cannot kill it with a goat. Not in a house or with a mouse...
 I don&#x27;t care if there is a running process there - in fact I probably want it to run to update my email. I assume that&#x27;s what it is doing.
 /shrug. 
 I mostly ignore it, but from time to time it grabs focus when I&#x27;m typing in another buffer and I need to re-focus the other buffer which is very annoying. The only way to make it go away is to quit and re-start emacs entirely, and to not run mu4e anymore.
 will never die

 ​
 The fonts seem off though, or maybe it&#x27;s just me. Can someone (in case you know what the problem may be) point me in the right direction on how to fix this? 
 ​
 When I say it feels off, it feels somewhat pixelated.

 In vim if you go into visual mode and select 5 lines and insert before the first line it will then insert before each of the lines selected in visual mode. This behavior doesn&#x27;t happen in evil mode.

 When working from home on my linux machine - I have all my org files on Dropbox. I store all agenda files, todos, references and stuff like that in those. Basically my whole life is in those org files. If I am away from a computer during the day I have an idea or I want to check my agenda - I can easily do so through an app called &quot;orgzly&quot;. All is well for now.
 Now imagine if I wanted to take notes while I am at work on a windows machine(I am an IT technician in a large factory. Also doing some development work, writing documentation for it, etc. A good code editor is a must)... I would of course also try to use emacs with org mode(writing in a word document and not having my shortcuts for text editing, hunting and pecking with mouse simply kills me). I…</span>

 After inspecting flymake.el, I can&#x27;t figure out how to change the face (foreground color) of the counters that appear in the mode line - see the link below.
 Any ideas?
 My searching -fu is weak for this problem. :\
 Thank you for any help!

 I usually update my OS before I turn off the computer. Started computer today and Emacs refused to start due to lbtiff.so.5 not found.
 Quick
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.6.0.0 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.5 
 (or recompile Emacs :)) fixes the problem; if anyone is experiencing the same issue.

                              <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;ve been using AucTex for awhile.
 I really like it for the most part, but I&#x27;m betting indentation issues that are becoming a bit unbearable.
 I&#x27;m getting way too much indentation on most environments, which breaks my yasnippets and hurts readability.

 And this is honestly something I could live with, but sometimes it just breaks altogether and decides to put 8 indents in the main scope and break everything.

 ​
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a proper solution for this. I even tried turning off indentation all together, and that didn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m new to emacs and I&#x27;ve just started using org-agenda and I have a question for you.
 Let&#x27;s suppose I&#x27;ve courses every Tuesday and Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00, starting on January 30, 2023, and up to march 18, 2023. I&#x27;m trying to enter this so that it shows in my org-agenda. I&#x27;ve done this in the following way:
 * TODO Biology class  :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: * TODO Biology class  :PROPERTIES: :LAST_REPEAT: [2023-03-18 Sat 0:00] :END: 
 When I activate the agenda view and go to yearly view (via the command org-agenda-year-view) I see the entries every Tuesday and Friday at the right time, but I also see them appear well beyond the LAST_REPEAT date that I fixed inside the PROPERTIES section.
 So my question is: am I understanding wrong the usage of LAST_REPEAT? Is this the expected behavior? What should I do to make those entries not show beyond a given day (i.e., once my courses are over)?
 Besides my particular question, I&#x27;m open to any suggestions as to how I could be doing this in a better/more practical way. I&#x27;m reading the manual online and this is what I&#x27;ve came up with, but it might be far from optimal.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

                              <span>Recently I have seen two:
  
Dfinity: Their job ads are all Rust now. Anyone know why they abandoned Haskell in favor of Rust?
 Tsuru Capital: No longer Haskell. Here I can ask further about their &quot;code sample&quot; problem. That problem seems like the perfect use-case for Haskell (reading &amp; parsing large files in constant memory using the streaming and parsing libraries), yet they still abandoned Haskell. How can you do the same in Rust? I thought your only option is going back to manual for-loops.
  
Do you have other examples? A growing trend or just 2 anomalies?

 &gt; A set of words is written down in the form of an ordinary &quot;long-hand&quot; addition sum, and it is required that the letters of the alphabet be replaced with decimal digits so that the result is a valid arithmetic sum.Example:
 SEND MORE ----- MONEY 
 This equation has a unique solution:
 9567 1085 ----- 10652 
 A non brute force solution is to use backtracking with memoization. My choice is to use the State Monad along with mutable Vectors. What I&#x27;m having trouble with writing is the part where a number is assigned to a letter. The steps for doing that are:
  
Find the currently unassigned numbers.
 For each unassigned number, add it to the solution, and recurse.
 If step 2 returns true, return true. Otherwise, remove the number from the solution.

                              <span>Hi, everyone! I&#x27;m a DataEngineer working with Python and Spark for the past few years. I want to start some Scala code here and need some advice for getting a couple of books for starters.
 People say &#x27;Learning Scala&#x27; by Jason Swartz is good but way too outdated as it is from 2015.
 Others say &#x27;Programming Scala&#x27; by Dwan Wampler os too difficult to begginers and uses Scala 3.0, which is not widely used yet.
 And some say &#x27;Scala Cookbook&#x27; by Alvin Alexander is good but misses fundamentals as it contains only recipes and assumes you already know the basics.
 Anything I&#x27;m missing here? Any recommendations?

                              <span>Annually we gather over 300 attendees at Scalar and have a great time discussing Scala! As the CfP is closing soon, we invite you to submit your talk! 🙋
 📥 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZh-gG3Zb3AxECUOVzq8anoCPlrOUGdtjCtxerWpnANN1DfA/viewform
 We are looking for anything that you think might be interesting for a wider audience and that is Scala related:
 ✨ Maybe you are using Scala in a novel way? 
 🧑‍💻 Or you wrote an interesting open-source library? 
 🦾 Or you have a use case to share from a project you are working on? 
 ⚙️ Or maybe you just want to show what can be done with the Scala language and existing Scala tools?
 Our main goal is to start some interesting discussions during the breaks and the after party, and inspire people to explore Scala and the Scala ecosystem later at home 💭
 Hence we are aiming at 30-minute presentations. We expect the audience to be familiar with the Scala language and its basic concepts. You don&#x27;t need to have any previous speaking experience 👶
 In case of any questions or doubts, write us at scalar@scalar-conf.com
 We&#x27;ll be happy to help ❤️

Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.

Abusing Constraints for Automatic Documentation by Sandy Maguire
Determining this by hand is tedious and error-prone, and worse, doesn’t stay up to date with code changes. Instead, let’s see how we can use the type system to eliminate the pain.
Binary search over floating point representations by Brent Yorgey
I got some good feedback on my last post about binary search, and thought it was worth a follow-up post.

                              <span>Can you provide me with tips on setting up emacs for full screen, multiple windows ? I like to use emacs with:
 - full screen with multiple tiled windows. (one window each for code, repl etc.)
 - be able to easily access a web browser, file explorer at the same time while looking at code in an emacs window. (and without having to shelf /iconify emacs). Are there emacs in-window solutions for these ? What do you use ?
 I think I&#x27;ve figured out how to setup the windows the way I like with various (split*) commands but still have not found a good workflow for mixing emacs with other tasks on my system...

 (setq auto-save-default nil)
 it&#x27;s as snappy as ever. I wonder if this is to do with me using gccemacs?
 Anyone care to comment?

                              <span>I use org-mode to create many of the documents I produce for both latex and html. However, I am having an issue that is the fault of the University&#x27;s content management system, and I am hoping there is a quick option in org-mode (though reading through the docs and source, I don&#x27;t see it).
 Basically, the CMS system first runs the HTML file through its own XML validator, which is rather stupid. There are two errors that prevent it from serving my ox-html output.
 First, the default ox-html mathjax declaration uses:
   
 But, technically, the async should be a keyword/value pair, async&#x3D;&quot;1&quot; (value doesn&#x27;t matter). I can fix that by customizing org-html-mathjax-template.
 Second, the default ox-html mathjax converter leaves the ampersand &amp; character untouched. This is valid and fine, except when one has to go through a stupid XML validator, which says that &amp; is the HTML start of a character code.
 Is there an option to enable ox-html to also convert &amp; to &amp; in mathjax formatting? Obviously, ox-html does that already for text. I can do it after the publish with some elisp, but that seems like a PITA (one I am willing to do though).
 Any suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>So i have been trying out https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge . the package is looking very good. But i couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to run source.organizeImports code action using any of it&#x27;s functions. If any of you guys have been trying it out or know already please help me out. My target is to bind a key to clean up unused imports.

                              <span>More and more I&#x27;ve become enamored of the idea that Emacs could be an interesting front-end for systems/infrastructure management via tooling like magit&#x27;s transient, hydras, consult-*, etc. The scenarios around Infrastructure-as-code, CM, CI/CD/orchestration tooling, and API interactions, well, it&#x27;s just a reformulation of the original use case for Emacs ... manipulating streams of text programmatically
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with API interactions via elisp specifically and, though I&#x27;m not a Lisp expert by any stretch, I can already see where elisp might not be as robust of choice for integrating with external systems as another Lisp variant (ex: Scheme? Common Lisp?). Particularly as it relates to concurrent operations, error-handling, and automated testing. I&#x27;m guessing it will eventually be beneficial to reach into tools written in Rust and Golang and other languages via methods other than stdout/stderr/stdin but that&#x27;s down the road a bit.
 So...the ask...any Lisp experts out there have insight as to which Lisp variant might be particularly good for:
 1) tight integration with Emacs and elisp
 2) integrating with other third-party APIs and particularly SaaS REST APIs
 3) ability to leverage non-Lisp ecosystem tooling with a level of effectiveness similar to, say, Python&#x27;s glue extensions 
 Note: Yes, Python is quite effective at this sort of thing itself and I did consider exploring how I could graft Python to elisp for this task. For now, I think I would like to stick with Lisps. If my motivation were purely practical I would probably skip straight to the Python route.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a vim user and looking to give emacs a try, mainly because of orgmode. Even though I know nothing about emacs, I don&#x27;t want to use a distribution like Doom because distributions are really hard to reconfigure. What I&#x27;m looking for is a config file that has features such as:
  
Sane defaults, where I can easily change some editor options like theme, font, font size, etc.
 
How to remap key bindings.
 
Plugin manager that does lazy loading and loads the config of each plugin from a separate file.
 
Installation of common plugins for completion, LSP, orgmode, git, the sort of things that almost anyone would need.
 
 I know such a request might sound ridiculous, but it&#x27;ll help massively in the initial phase.

                              <span>The 7.0 release of Texinfo included this little mention: 
  
. EPUB 3 added as an output format, selected with --epub3
  
Which means that you can now convert .texi into .epub. So you can now convert Emacs Manual, the ELisp reference and others to .epub, load them on your e-book reader of choice and go to the beach, the forest, or wherever.
 The process is quite easy, if you have Texinfo &gt;&#x3D; 7.0 installed (texi2any --version):
  
Download the Texinfo source of the manual you want to convert like the Emacs Manual
 Ask texi2any to convert it:
  
 TEXINPUTS&#x3D;&quot;.:.:&quot; MAKEINFO&#x3D;&quot;makeinfo --force --enable-encoding -I .&quot; texi2any --epub3 emacs.texi 
 Replace emacs.texi with the name of the root .texi file of the manual you are interested in.
 The results are quite good, I&#x27;ve been reading the Emacs Manual again this way.
 The FSF publishes manuals for most GNU projects along with manuals related to Emacs though Texinfo sources are not published for all of them, you&#x27;ll need to grab the release then.

                              <span>Recently, I am working on packaging Haskell web apps in docker containers for myself. I guess nix and stack together can do this pretty well, but that is a hell I&#x27;m not ready to revisit.
 I am on Arch Linux, so I figured I would try building the app locally and then copying it into the official archlinux image. Easy enough, and hey, &quot;everything works!&quot; But I encountered a strange problem when I deployed the container on an Ubuntu VM hosted in the cloud. I get the following error only in the Ubuntu vm and only when running a haskell binary that is linked with the threaded runtime:
 hello: internal error: Itimer: Failed to spawn thread: Operation not permitted (GHC version 9.2.2 for x86_64_unknown_linux) Please report this as a GHC bug: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug

                              <span>Once upon a purely functional time,
 There was a language that shone so sublime.
 Its syntax, a study in elegance and grace,
 Was a delight to the most discerning codebase.
 This language was Haskell, a work of art,
 Whose powers of abstraction were second to none.
 It offered a refuge from the mundane and the coarse,
 A place where programmers could unleash their force.
 With Haskell, the horrors of side effects were laid to rest,
 As code was lifted up to a realm of the blest.
 No longer were we slaves to the whims of state,
 But masters of our domain, no longer irate.
 Yet Haskell was not for the faint of heart,
 For it demanded a level of discipline from the start.
 But for those who persevered, the rewards were great,
 As they soared through the skies, their code first rate.
 So if you seek a language that&#x27;s pure and true,
 One that will elevate your code to something new,
 Then look no further, for Haskell is the one,
 A language that will surely have your code on the run.

For regular functors we have natural transformation of type forall a. f a -&gt; g a for some functors F and G, but I&#x27;ve heard somewhere here, that for ends, and therefore arrows, fullblown naturality will be an overkill, but I don&#x27;t see why yet (arrows are (strong) profunctor monoids, where the composition is defined as a coend). But how do we implement forall a b. p a b -&gt; q a b then, when we can only map p a a to q a a? Or does it require a more strong condition?

                              <span>I am currently hitting the very disappointing reality of Template Haskell. Given a Haskell function I want to generate a second one that is slightly different, for example:
 foo i [] &#x3D; [] foo i (x:xs) &#x3D; i : foo xs 
 should allow me to generate
 foo&#x27; i [] &#x3D; 1 foo&#x27; i (x:xs) &#x3D; 1 + foo&#x27; xs 
 that mirrors the recursive structure of the function. I CAN&#x27;T change the original function foo to use something like recursion schemes.
 My initial idea was to use TemplateHaskell, get the name of the function, lookup its definition and then change it accordingly. But as the documentation states
  
The Maybe Dec field contains Just the declaration which defined the variable - including the RHS of the declaration - or else Nothing, in the case where the RHS is unavailable to the compiler. At present, this value is always Nothing: returning the RHS has not yet been implemented because of lack of interest.
  
So my second guess was to use write a QuasiQuoter and surround the original function with it. I can use ghc-exactprint to parse the function, but that gives me a HsSyn AST, not a template haskell AST. I started writing a conversion function, but this very tedious.
 Is there a better way to achieve this? Is there such a function already?

                              <span>Another piece of fallout from Advent of Code. One of the problems was a cellular-automata-like problem. I initially used a Set to represent the items in the grid, but it had a runtime of about 6 minutes. I swapped out the underlying representation to be an Array of Maybe Automaton, and dropped the runtime to about 7 seconds.
 The bad news is that the code is even more imperative in style than it was before.
 Writeup on my blog. I think it serves as an example of how you can do imperative, state-mutating code in Haskell, and as a fuller worked example than some of the tutorials online.
 Anyone have any thoughts?

                              <span>Most mutable things in Haskell (IORef, STRef, TVar, etc.) share a common interface, which we can describe with a small typeclass:
  class Ref f m where readRef :: f a -&gt; m a writeRef :: f a -&gt; a -&gt; m () 
 There are some (seemingly) obvious laws:
  
(writeRef ref x &gt;&gt; readRef ref) &#x3D;&#x3D; pure x
 (readRef ref &gt;&gt;&#x3D; writeRef ref) &#x3D;&#x3D; pure ()
 (writeRef ref x &gt;&gt; readRef ref&#x27;) &#x3D;&#x3D; readRef ref&#x27; if ref and ref&#x27; are disjoint
  
It&#x27;s often convenient to package up a curried Ref dictionary:
 data Var m a &#x3D; Var { readVar :: m a , writeVar :: a -&gt; m () } instance Ref (Var m) m where readRef &#x3D; readVar writeRef &#x3D; writeVar refToVar :: Ref f m &#x3D;&gt; f a -&gt; Var m a refToVar ref &#x3D; Var (readRef ref) (writeRef ref) 
 Conveniently, this definition of Var admits derived instances of FunctorT, DistributiveT, and Applicativ…</span>

                              <span>The documentation for Data.Compact claims that:
  
Pinned ByteArray# objects cannot be compacted. This is for a good reason: the memory is pinned so that it can be referenced by address (the address might be stored in a C data structure, for example), so we can&#x27;t make a copy of it to store in the Compact.
  
ByteArray# is the memory form of Text and ShortByteString, meaning you can&#x27;t create a Compact of any datatype that contains Text or ShortByteString - including FastString. 
 But it&#x27;s not clear to me why that&#x27;s the case. We have a ByteArray#. It&#x27;s pinned, so we can pass that to a C program through the FFI. From my perspective, copying the ByteArray# to a new pinned location in the compact region seems like it should be fine?
 What if GHC did decide to copy the data? What sorts of warnings and errors could happen instead?

One of our services is running backgrounds jobs with a rather complicated amount of logic using DB tables to make sure only one instance of the jobs is running across our three service instances. I was hoping to remove all that code that requires maintenance. Is there a framework that can do this for us? I&#x27;ve done this in the past running the jobs in kubernetes directly but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll be an option here.

                              <span>What is the simplest way to perform a HTTP call from Outwatch that would conform to the architecture of this framework? Please treat this question as ELIP (Explain Like I’m a Pythonista with very limited understanding of functional concepts).
 The outwatch documentation shows how I can display dynamic contents based on Observables. The examples, however, show only observables that change their state via user action or timer ticks.
 I think I need to somehow create an Observable that would represent the query, so that when the query succeeds/fails the content of the page gets updated accordingly. I was thinking about using http4s library as this is what I use on the backend, but the documentation for http4s describes only very simple case of client code, where the calls are represented by IO[String] values that are synchronously executed. I also tried to search in Outwatch and colibri documentation, to no avail.
 I will be glad for both examples and theoretical explanations.

                              <span>I am watching this great talk by Daniel Spiewak motivating effects. In particular, there is a point where he mentions that you can&#x27;t do retries with Future, but you can with effects. Of course you literally can do retries with futures (e.g. here), but you risk repeating side-effects that aren&#x27;t properly contained in a transaction. Why is this not the case for effects?
 Example: say I want to log a statement then read a value from a database. In the case of a future retry, suppose the first attempt logs successfully then fails to read. The retry logs the statement again then reads from the database (successfully), resulting in two logs instead of 1. Why would an effects implementation only log once, supposing the same scenario?

                              <span>So like everyone else, I&#x27;ve been playing with ChatGPT, and for me, the most interesting thing it can do is help me understand code, or search for hard-to-find documentation.
 Here, I&#x27;ve asked it to describe to me what a function does. (This is code that I wrote myself.)

 It does a pretty good job! It even guesses that I might be matching against ~ because I&#x27;m looking for backup files.
 So elisp isn&#x27;t my main language; maybe I could be doing things better.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I have been using Corfu completion for quite some time now and one thing that annoys me so much is the beep on the first time the dropdown shows, no beeps after. I have already digged into corfu source code and it looks like the beep comes from somewhere else but somehow related to corfu. I have already test default completion-at-point and company and no beeps.
 Anyone have experienced similar issue and managed to silence it? ChatGPT suggested me to (setq corfu-beep-p nil) which is ridiculous. 
 Here&#x27;s part of my config: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;lisp (customize-set-variable &#x27;ring-bell-function &#x27;ignore)
 (use-package corfu :straight (corfu :files (:defaults &quot;extensions/*&quot;) :includes (corfu-history)) :custom (corfu-cycle t) (corfu-auto t) (corfu-auto-prefix 2) (corfu-auto-delay 0.0) (corfu-quit-at-boundary &#x27;separator) (corfu-preview-current &#x27;insert) (corfu-preselect-first nil) (corfu-on-exact-match nil) (corfu-min-width 80) (corfu-count 14) (corfu-scroll-margin 4) (corfu-popupinfo-delay t) :init (global-corfu-mode) (corfu-history-mode) (corfu-popupinfo-mode) (add-to-list &#x27;savehist-additional-variables &#x27;corfu-history)) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am using emacs-plus@28 on mac.
 EDIT: Simply (use-package corfu) also beeps on C-M-i.

                              <span>I have managed to build emacs-30.0.5 from source on a RHEL8 system. This took a lot of effort and compiling of other libraries to make it work.
 ​
 Emacs GUI comes up and many of my packages start and run. The issue is, the font I want is not being picked up. I want to use Fira Code as a font. The ttf files are installed in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. I ran fc-cache for the system to detect them. fc-cache says there are 10 fonts in my ~/.local/share/fonts directory. The desktop font selection tool sees them and is able to use them for other GUI elements. 
 ​
 When I use Options-&gt;Set Default Font it pops up a small GUI that only knows a few fonts. It does not start the system font selection tool. My home PC does bring up the system font selection tool.
 ​
 In my custom-vars.el, which is loaded by init.el I have the following:
 (custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right.
 &#x27;(default ((t (:family &quot;Fira Code&quot; :foundry &quot;CTDB&quot; :slant normal :weight medium :height 113 :width normal)))))
 ​
 This works on my PC at home, but not my RHEL8 computer. There are no messages in the *Messages* buffer and there is no *Warnings* buffer. The GUI comes up and runs with some horrible default font that is hard to read. 
 ​
 Any ideas on what I am missing or doing wrong? Is it something I missed in compiling emacs? Something I am not setting up in my environment?

                              <span>Has anyone told you that they&#x27;d like to learn more about this Emacs thing you&#x27;re always talking about? Does that fill your heart with joy and just a little bit of cringe when you know they&#x27;re going to be looking at stock Emacs with a blinding white background and non-standard discoverability? Do you jump in and say, &quot;here take this config file to help make things easier&quot; or the like?
 This little project was born out of that frustration.
 Presenting, Emacs Bedrock
 Yes, I am an Emacs evangelist, and all around me know it. (Sorry guys.) I vacillate between giving people too much help or too little, I think. The ideal is to encourage new folks just enough to get over the initial hump and get them figuring out what they need to customize to get Emacs to work for their specific needs.
 This is just a little side project for me. I&#x27;ve had the ideas for this bubbling ever since Emacs 29 packed in so many nice features I wondered just how many of my 3rd-party packages I really needed. (Answer: I still have over 100 installed!)
 This package doesn&#x27;t focus on setting a nice theme (though it does use modus-vivendi) or doing fancy package customization stuff. This aims to be brutally simple so that new users can inspect it and try it out.
 I&#x27;d love to get some feedback. Feel free to leave comments here or on the SourceHut issue tracker.
 (There is also a GitHub mirror if SourceHut doesn&#x27;t work for you for some reason.)

 I have searched online, but this seems rather specific.

                              <span>Hi all, I am using emacs 24.4.1 on a virtual machine on which I cannot install any additional packages so my configuration is very simple. I often have to work with very large files, a few hundred Megabytes and I find isearch to be really really slow to the point it is unusable. The files are opened with Fundamental mode, I tried disabling the Hi minor mode, I also tried to set the lazy-highlight variable to nil from a post I found on the internet as suggestion to speed isearch up, but there is no noticeable change. When searching the same files with vim/gvim the search is super fast and I am able to quickly jump through the file and find all patterns matching the string. Why is there such a huge difference between emacs and vim search? Is there a way to speed up emacs when working with big files?

 works well, particularly after custom defining additional file type pairs with

 However, it does not switch files when point in on include directive in c/cpp files. Setting

 (setq ff-ignore-include t) does not seem to have any affect whatsoever

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to write my own helm source that is alist. I&#x27;m looking at the documentation here https://wikemacs.org/wiki/How_to_write_helm_extensions#Separate_candidates.27_sets_for_searching_and_for_actions
 but it does not work for me. The differences in my case are:
  
I&#x27;m using function instead of static set. The function returns alist as in the example, but I receive/can get only the car of the selected item, don&#x27;t see the alist
 I&#x27;m using helm-comp-read, if this makes any difference
  
The docstring says
  
- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table. 
 For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of 
 candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil. 
 It can be also a function that receives three arguments: 
 the values string, predicate and t. See &#x60;all-completions&#x27; for more details.
  
looking at &#x60;all-completions&#x60; docstring does not make it clearer to me.
 edit:
 &#x60;helm-comp-read-get-candidates&#x60; has hint:
  
ALISTP when non--nil will not use &#x60;all-completions&#x27; to collect 
 candidates because it doesn&#x27;t handle alists correctly for helm. 
 i.e In &#x60;all-completions&#x27; the car of each pair is used as value. 
 In helm we want to use the cdr instead like (display . real), 
 so we return the alist as it is with no transformation by 
 &#x60;all-completions&#x27;.

In this menu I can navigate from person to person (father, mother and children). The box at the bottom shows the relevant metadata for the highlighted person.
 Any hints on how something similar could be achieved with Emacs? Is there a package to create menu screens, as were used in the old MS-DOS programs?

                              <span>Sometimes it is annoying to wait for emacs to send a larger email (potentially over a slower connection). Using async it is possible to send email asynchronously, but you may loose your email if something goes wrong. Emacs now has built-in support for sqlite which can be used as a safe and simple mechanism (sqlite supports accessing a DB using multiple processes) for inter-process communication between the main emacs process and the emacs process that async spawns and to persistently store emails to be send and errors that occur during sending. This also enables retrying to send an email that failed to be send. Furthermore, for queued emails we can flush them in parallel. 
 I&#x27;ve now put this into a package on github that tries to load mu4e, but does not fail if the user is not using mu4e, but gnus. This should work on Emacs 29 (sqlite support) for any email client that uses the gnus and smtpmail functions to send email. However, since this queues emails in sqlite anything that displays queue sizes would have to be adviced to use async-email-sending--num-queued-emails instead.

 Hi all, when I added a hook to enable paredit mode for eval-expression mini buffer, hitting  created a newline instead of evaluating the expression. Not sure how to fix this? Any ideas?
 Currently, if I remove this hook, then it works fine. But it&#x27;s really nice to enable paredit mode when doing some quick evaluation using M + :

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I have been preparing training videos for my team, specially, devs that have never used Scala, in this one, I recorded myself while implementing a feature, from the beginning to get it merged. This even includes some initial experimentation to make sure the feature works, creating some tests, and, finally, refactor the code to improve it.
 I hope it can be helpful for the community:

                              <span>Akif has been writing a new ZIO-inspired functional effect library from scratch to understand what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. In this presentation, he shows some of the techniques used, discusses his approach to error handling, and walks through the lessons from this exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ZNB2epqQhc8

  com.wbillingsley %%% veautiful % 0.3-M5 
  com.wbillingsley %%% doctacular % 0.3-M5 
 The highlight for this one is probably moving the little router from the &quot;templates&quot; package into core (and adding some documentation) so that there is a little router included in the vanilla version. The syntax for the d3-like component has also been improved, along with a few other tweaks
 Release notes here https://github.com/wbillingsley/veautiful/releases/tag/v0.3-M5
 0.3-M6 is likely to be out soon (at least before the 18th). That one might also get called &quot;0.3.0&quot;.

https://seanlawson.net/2021/08/save-quotations-zettelkasten-method/
I&#x27;ve tried searching in the forum, but haven&#x27;t found a suitable topic about.
I find some of the point make sense, althought in my practice I&#x27;m almost always rewriting things on my own, making very rarely quotes in my notes and tend to revisit my own writes rather than original sources more than one time.
I&#x27;d like to hear your position about, and if and how you use quotes, and how you balance advantages and drawbacks of using/not using quotes in your notes.</span>

 SimpleX Chat is developed in Haskell - without huge support from Haskell community and help from u/angerman it would not be possible.
 We will be hiring soon – let me know if you are interested!
 Some Haskell-specific challenges we need to solve:
  
reliability/security of Cryptonite
 memory leaks in networking stack
 compilation for the web
 and many more!
  
Version 4.4 added:
  
disappearing messages – the most frequent request from the users. To use them both conversation parties should agree to it, unlike in most other messengers that allow to send disappearing messages without recipients&#x27; agreement.
 connection security code verification – it allows to confirm that the connection keys/addresses were not substituted (man-in-the-middle attack).
 &quot;live&quot; messages – they update to all recipients as you type them, every several seconds.
 French language interface - thanks to users community and Weblate!
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

 A couple weeks ago I started building my own using conduit-audio and the Haskell wrapper for the WebRTC VAD, and the OpenAI Whisper model.
 https://gitlab.com/ludflu/vad-audio
 I&#x27;m getting ready to package it up and upload to hackage. Besides adding a demo video &amp; unit tests, are there any recommended changes people have that would make adoption/contributions easier?

                              <span>I have this code: 
 R1: h k p &#x3D; snd p &gt; k
 R2: filter _ [] &#x3D; []
 R3: filter p (x:xs) &#x3D; if p x then x:ys else ys

 ys &#x3D; Main.filter p xs

 R4: zip [] _ &#x3D; []
 R5: zip _ [] &#x3D; []
 R6: zip (x:xs) (y:ys) &#x3D; (x,y) : Main.zip xs ys
 R7: zip _ _ &#x3D; error &quot;ouch!!&quot;
 ​
 When I call it with &quot; Main.filter (h &#x27;3&#x27;) (Main.zip (error &quot;ERR&quot;:&quot;1&quot;) [&#x27;a&#x27;..]) &quot; i have an error. 
 I get the error that I pass to the map function. Execution returns the &quot;ERR&quot; error because it compiles: R2 -&gt; R3 which brings me to R4 because there is &quot;if p x&quot;. And I am interested in what is inside the map, so I go to R4 (fail matching pattern), R5 (fail matching pattern), R6 and inside R6 I find the error as x. 
 Is the execution correct?
 Thanks

 Now I need to include a color box in a mini page for which the latex code looks like this:
 \\begin{tcolorbox}[colback&#x3D;white,colframe&#x3D;dkgreen,sharp corners&#x3D;uphill] 
 But within org-mode, instead of creating a color box, the attributes are displayed as such. [colback&#x3D;white,colframe&#x3D;dkgreen,sharp corners&#x3D;uphill]. I don&#x27;t how to include attributes.
 Any help in this regard is appreciated.

 Can someone point me at the Right Way?

 (setq-default py-split-window-on-execute nil)
 in my dotemacs. I&#x27;m keeping the post for anyone else who finds this.
 Using &#x27;t&#x27; instead of &#x27;nil&#x27; would create a new window, but only if the relevant window wasn&#x27;t already up.
 __________________________________________
 ORIGINAL:
 I tend to code by having a python shell in one window, and the code in the other window, typically with a vertical divider between them. If I choose a region in the code window, and run py-execute-region (&quot;C-c |&quot;), it&#x27;s insanely annoying that a new window gets created each time, below the two existing windows, with the same code buffer in it.
 How do I save my sanity? Expected operation would be that the region gets executed in the python buffer, without creating any new windows.
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using python-mode.el or python.el. Is there any easy way to tell? Is there an easy way to choose one or the other at runtime? I don&#x27;t see any python-mode.el in my dotemacs, I&#x27;m not sure where any non-default version would be loaded.
 I&#x27;m running Emacs 25.2.2.
 I found this but wasn&#x27;t able to solve the problem, sharing it as a starting point for anyone else: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24119221/customize-window-splitting-in-emacs-python-mode

 Is there some way to set the value on a project, directory or file basis?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I set a goal of only using Emacs (where possible) and while I have been googling a lot to try and get things set up the one thing that I’ve not quite cracked is C#.
 Can anyone recommend any good (up to date) tutorials on setting emacs up for C# and omnisharp-roslyn?

                              <span>I have been watching Karthink&#x27;s org-auctex library for a while. While I was never able to get it working well for me I kept checking in on it because I so wanted faster latex previews in org. This morning I found that Karthink had a new repo org-preview which is amazing. It is super fast, worked for me out of the box, and centers display math! Plus it works with org-fragtog which I also love. 
 Repo says its still in very early development (seems to only be a week or so old) but figured I would share my enthusiasm about it. 
 (Thank you u/karthink!)

                              <span>I have already set up showing completion of regular org-mode TODOs in my agenda log, and I have the variables org-agenda-start-with-log-mode and org-log-done both set to t. However, I would really like it if there was a way to log completion of habits and repeating tasks in the same place. I am guessing it doesn&#x27;t work because when these tasks are done, the state doesn&#x27;t change from TODO to DONE, but I&#x27;m not aware of the way to get around this. Can anyone help? Thanks!

                              <span>I am really stuck with learning this bit of Haskell. I have a function that accesses the twitter REST api. 
 The issue I am grappling with is that the api sometimes returns an token for the next page. I need to loop through each of the individual calls until this token is no longer present. In imperitive programming this is a simple &#x60;while&#x60; loop. I am struggling to find a functional form that works.
 This is the current signature of the get_tweets function
  get_tweets :: NW.Options -&gt; IO TwitterResponse 
 where TwitterResponse is 
  data TwitterResponse &#x3D; Failed | Partial (String, TwitterApiResponse) | Final TwitterApiResponse 
 The String in Partial is the pagination token.

                              <span>Greetings fellow Haskellers,
 I&#x27;ve decided 2023 is the year I&#x27;m going to learn and become productive in Haskell. I installed everything I think I need through GHCup. I can make my own projects with &#x60;stack new&#x60; and everything works _okay_. HLS seems to need restarts from time to time, though. But in any case, I am working through Haskell in Depth and I can&#x27;t really work with the example repo at all. When I open the directory in VSCode, I get this fairly inscrutable error at the top of any file I open:
 : cannot satisfy -package z-hid-examples-z-contexts (use -v for more information) 
 Any call to \&#x60;stack build\&#x60; fails with a bunch of constraint violations. The output appears to be complaining about which GHC I am using. In short, I am wondering whether there is any up-to-date, authoritative guide I can follow to fix my configuration so I can work through this stuff. Examples on the web seem to be mostly a bit old and piecemeal.

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing an exercise that computes all primes up to a given n using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For learning, I decided to use mutable vector and monad. This is where things got really confusing because all the examples/tutorials/articles I found are either trivial, or over my head.
 The following code works, but I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to filter out the composite numbers without unfreezing the vector. My attempt to do so using forM and guard didn&#x27;t compile.
 Signature of primesUpTo is determined by the exercise and can&#x27;t be modified.
 module Sieve (primesUpTo) where import Control.Monad as M import Control.Monad.Reader (ReaderT) import qualified Control.Monad.Reader as R import Control.Monad.ST (ST) import qualified Control.Monad.ST as ST import Data.Vector.Unboxed ((!)) import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed as U import Data.Vector.Unboxed.Mutable (MVector) import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed.Mutable as VM -- You should not use any of the division operations when implementing -- the sieve of Eratosthenes. import Prelude hiding (div, divMod, mod, quot, quotRem, rem, (/)) type MyVec s &#x3D; ReaderT (MVector s Bool) (ST s) primesUpTo :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] primesUpTo n &#x3D; ST.runST $ do let n&#x27; &#x3D; fromInteger n v  do y  do -- y  Integer -&gt; MyVec s () mark x n &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [x * x, x * x + x .. n] v  do VM.unsafeWrite v (fromInteger i) False

                              <span>Hello Scala Family, I am new to scala and currently on symbol literals topic. I am getting this error 
 Index.scala:35: error: value nameField is not a member of Index.Person 
 code 
 object Index { class Person { val name &#x3D; &quot;Zoned&quot; def sayHello():Unit &#x3D; { println(&quot;Mockery&quot;) } } def main(args: Array[String]): Unit &#x3D; { val person &#x3D; new Person val nameField &#x3D; Symbol(&quot;name&quot;) println(person.nameField) } } 
 I understand the overall definition of it and its use but it isn&#x27;t accessing the name variable inside Person class as It should be.
 Is there something I am missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve used TickTick for years but it&#x27;s bloated in comparison to what I&#x27;ve seen with the Orgzly app on Android. I&#x27;m a non-coder. Do you think I&#x27;m going to run into problems using this app for task and project management without having coding knowledge? I also was wondering if there is a way to embed Orgzly into Notion. Eventually I&#x27;d like to learn something like Org Mode but for the time being I&#x27;m going to use Notion due to life being busy.

 Thanks for all your help!

 ​
 I have an MacBook Pro M1 and I am trying to configure mbsync. Previously it worked flawlessly but now it requires oauth2 and the only message that I got is:
 Error performing SASL authentication step: SASL(-1): generic failure: Unable to find a callback: 18948
 I register the application in Azure and edited my config.json but it doesn&#x27;t work. Do you have any hints what is going on?

                              <span>When I install a mode it will build the native eln file and use it.
 I&#x27;d like to build a version of emacs where there is no .el, .elc files just only .eln ones.
 What I mean roughly to remove the &quot;straight&quot;, &quot;melpa&quot;, &quot;elpa&quot; ... folders and load the modes from the &quot;eln-cache&quot; folder ...
 Can I make it ?
 Can I avoid the package manager from my version ?
 Can I put these files to the &quot;emacs program&quot; directory structure and use the &quot;.emacs.d&quot; only for the &quot;small/machine specific&quot; configuration changes ?
 Am I a wrong direction ? :D

                              <span>I recently discovered that the xdg-basedir library on Hackage only covered a very limited part of the XDG Basedir Specification, namely just reading the environment variables and returning paths for directories and files, and only for the categories or config, data and cache.
 But the XDG Basedir is so much more!
 First, there are other categories, state and runtime. Second, there&#x27;s a whole logic to what files should be read: either you want to read only one file, and the application should try each directory for the category and give you the content of the first file that is available, or you want all available files merged together. Also, relative paths in the environment variables should be ignored.
 So I created xdg-basedir-compliant. It was fun to create because thanks to Polysemy, I could easily do TDD with non-IO interpreters.
 I hope the API is practical. I do hope people will use the library and I would very much welcome feedback on its use!

 I was trying the 2nd day of AOC; and just for funsies i was trying to model the rock-paper-scissors game through a type-class (my motivation was that i didn&#x27;t want to update the result function if i were to extend the rock-paper-scissors with spock or some other variant). Nevertheless, I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out how to promote a value to it&#x27;s promoted-type (see result&#x27; at the bottom for the issue)

 Just looking for some feedback, get some clarity and to improve my haskell skills.
 This project I believe will grow into something bigger. I want to make it for different types of poker games and add in game theory elements to it. So this is more of a starting point. Right now it only supports Texas hold&#x27;em. I won&#x27;t go too much into the rules of poker, nor does it matter much, but say you have 2 cards and you want to calculate the odds of winning against any two cards.
 That means I need to calculate all combinations of 2 choose 50 &#x3D; 1225
 Then (say this is Texas holdem...if you know those rules cool, if not, all good, not needed...)

                              <span>Hey ... and happy New Year. Instead of going to an all night party this year I opted to release another update video about Game :: Dangerous, a game engine written in Haskell that I&#x27;ve been working on since August 2015. Since I last posted about it I&#x27;ve migrated the project to Haskell Stack and GHC 9.x, so the newer hybrid garbage collector is now utilised (and should bring noticeable performance improvements). In this video I explain a bit about the map development server I&#x27;m working on and give a brief demonstration.
 Following feedback from the community I&#x27;ve done a fair bit of refactoring. The code will probably still look pretty crazy in places but I&#x27;ve tried to tame the worst of the craziness somewhat. If anyone wants to give feedback I&#x27;d be interested in what you think of the recursive control structure in module HandleInput. Anyway, take it easy.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to emacs, I decided to go with doom emacs to get something sort of ready made. But I just don&#x27;t understand why my copy paste commands are so messed up. And they don&#x27;t work either. I used F10 to get a visual on what the commands where supposed to be, since C-w, M-w and C-y did nothing. I don&#x27;t understand what S-delete means, shift-S-delete? Doesn&#x27;t work. And I note M-w is the normal key binding but it does not work either.
 If I turn on CUA mode and use C-x / C-c / C-v then it works with key commands, otherwise nothing really works. Incredibly frustrating. I was trying to get used to the normal emacs commands but turns out they where not even there. Might there be some addon in doom emacs causing this?

                              <span>When I switch to another branch, I would like to see the mode line updates the branch name, but it only updates when I do some actions. I&#x27;m thinking about using (run-with-idle-timer 0 1 #&#x27;(lambda () (force-mode-line-update t))) to do this, is this correct? I&#x27;m also worried if this would cause performance issues. Or is there a better way to do this?
 Thanks, and happy new year!

 I want to create faces for #+begin_notes, and #+begin_comment blocks. 
 I know how to create faces using defface, but I do not know how to integrate it with org-mode.

​
 Is
  
(other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
  
part necessary?
 ​
 Why it can&#x27;t be
  
(list (read-buffer &quot;Append to buffer: &quot;) 
 (region-beginning) (region-end)))
  
alone?

                              <span>If I have an admin account on a remote server, how do I execute a sudo command on the remote after logging in as admin?
 The main problem seems to be responding to the password prompt for the sudo user.
 I have been doing it as root after setting the ssh key for the session, directly in org-babel files where I use ssh root@host &#x27;command in a local script as well as remotely where I set :dir /ssh:root@host:~/workingirectory, but I think that is unsafe and I want to do it as an admin user with sudo.

Rather than opening file with new buffer, I want to open in split window vertically or horizontally with a keybind. Thank you

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m using Emacs 28 on Mac OS Ventura.
 I have installed tree-sitter cli from rust cargo, but when I try to call it from eshell, it said it cannot find the executable. It&#x27;s fine in the iTerm2.
 I have installed package exec-path-from-shell to copy shell&#x27;s environment PATH for Emacs to use.
 And I have checked the $PATH in the eshell which contains cargo binary directory and I can call tree-sitter cli using the absolute path.
 Any idea why eshell cannot find the executable? (I have also tried to add the directory to &#x27;exec-path but it still cannot find it.

                              <span>10 years ago I learned that no, I couldn&#x27;t just &quot;skip learning about Git&quot; and use timestamped zip files instead just because I&#x27;m only 1 developer. This shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone here. The benefits of Git speak for themselves, even for just 1 developer.
 Today, I had a strange experience. For a while I&#x27;ve believed that if you&#x27;re just 1 developer, only cabal is enough. However I came across a concrete use case where it&#x27;s not enough! Here&#x27;s what happened:
  
I wanted to checkout an old commit of my personal project and run it.
 BOOM. Everything went out of whack because another personal project on my local machine was now at the wrong commit! These two different projects were no longer in sync!
  
My friends. Doesn&#x27;t this prove the necessity of Nix, even for 1 developer? Just wanted to confirm with you before I go any further.

 fg &#x3D; C.fromGregorian year month firstDay &#x3D; fg 1 lastDay &#x3D; fg $ C.gregorianMonthLength year month allDays &#x3D; map WD.toWeekDate [firstDay .. lastDay] 
 There is a function periodAllDays (this commit) that seems to do what I&#x27;m doing above, but when I use it, I get an error.
  
Not in scope: ‘C.periodAlldays’ 
 Module ‘Data.Time.Calendar’ does not export ‘periodAlldays’.

                              <span>I find myself naming things with &quot;-able&quot; suffix. For example if I want to be able to pull out a &quot;Matrix&quot; type from a few different types I&#x27;ll create a &quot;Matrixable&quot; class. But I can&#x27;t help but notice &quot;Functor&quot;, &quot;Semiring&quot; etc...are not named &quot;Mappable&quot; etc.
 Anyone have any opinions on this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a zettelkasten noob.  This morning while in bed pondering zettelkasten and just ruminating in general the idea for this zettel popped into my brain.  So I grabbed my phone and made a fleeting note &quot;Life is a tickertape&quot;.  Later I came and composed this zettel.
While I&#x27;ve been trying to begin my zk with notes from sources with the hopes of building it up over time, I also very much want to capture these kinds of musings.  I fact it&#x27;s an eye toward this kind of thing that is my primary motivation to create a zk.
Since I&#x27;m still new to this, I&#x27;d like to start off on the best foot possible, so any advice about what I&#x27;m doing here would be appreciated.
Thanks!

  
Life is a Tickertape

Life is experienced moment-to-moment, like an old fashioned tickertape.  This is how we receive information.  Reading, lectures, podcasts, speeches, these are sequences of words.  Music is sequences of sounds.  Movies are sequences of pictures.  All of these represent bits of information that come in one at a [[time]].
Similarly, reasoning seems to be a series of logical steps that take us from idea to idea to idea until we reach a conclusion.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a zettelkasten noob.  This morning while in bed pondering zettelkasten and just ruminating in general the idea for this zettel popped into my brain.  So I grabbed my phone and made a fleeting note &quot;Life is a tickertape&quot;.  Later I came and composed this zettel.
While I&#x27;ve been trying to begin my zk with notes from sources with the hopes of building it up over time, I also very much want to capture these kinds of musings.  I fact it&#x27;s an eye toward this kind of thing that is my primary motivation to create a zk.
Since I&#x27;m still new to this, I&#x27;d like to start off on the best foot possible, so any advice about what I&#x27;m doing here would be appreciated.
Thanks!

Life is experienced moment-to-moment, like an old fashioned tickertape.  This is how we receive information.  Reading, lectures, podcasts, speeches, these are sequences of words.  Music is sequences of sounds.  Movies are sequences of pictures.  All of these represent bits of information that come in one at a [[time]].
Similarly, reasoning seems to be a series of logical steps that take us from idea to idea to idea until we reach a conclusion.
In contrast, our [[brain]]s seem to operate as an interlinking network.  At the lowest level it&#x27;s a web of interconnected synapses.  At a higher level our thoughts seem like a web of associations, similar to a [[mind map]].
Question: Since our experiences are sequential, but the organization of our thoughts is more of a network or web of associations, how to we integrate these concepts?

                              <span>Hey guys! I&#x27;m new to the forum and to all this Zettelkasten method. I&#x27;ve tried writing my first Zettel and I would apreciate if you could tell me what I can improve in it!  
I&#x27;ve written it in Portuguese and auto-translated it to English using Google Translator (imma be honest here, I&#x27;m too lazy to translate it manually lol).
As a first try I used a post from this Zettelkasten website as a reference to it and based on what I understood, I wrote this:

# The reading of a text must be accompanied by notes and writing

Understanding the content of a text and absorbing the knowledge present in it only happens during the active stage of reading, which is taking notes and writing about the ideas that the text presents. In a passive reading, where the text is just read, the information is retained for a much smaller amount and time, in addition to the fact that the main ideas are not worked through the reader&#x27;s knowledge.

Annotations allow ideas to flow and solidify in the reader&#x27;s mind, allowing them to retain longer and be able to question them to lead to new questions and answers. Writing allows the connections of ideas to be transmitted in words to paper or document so that others can read, understand and process these ideas so that new connections are established.

                              <span>Hi everyone! 
 Can someone please explain to me how I can &quot;style&quot; a (custom or built in) link properly? 
 What I want to achieve is basically some similar look, to what you can do with e.g. the :before element in CSS, where you e.g. display a little link icon in front the actual link.
 The icons can come from a font like e.g. Fontawesome and/or svg source.
 With the following code I managed to show an icon from all-the-icons, which I replaced with the letter M here for better readability. The problem with this is however, that it does not only change the word menu to an M inside the link only.
 (org-deflink menu &quot;Style and export for menu links&quot; [:face &#x27;(:box &quot;gray60&quot; :background &quot;gray95&quot; :foreground &quot;purple&quot;)]) (setq prettify-symbols-alist &#x27;((&quot;menu&quot; . &quot;M&quot;))) (prettify-symbols-mode 1) 
 The plain text looks like:
 Plain Text
 and the &quot;styled&quot; version of that input looks like:

 I don&#x27;t think eglot has the ability to show code lenses (unless I&#x27;m missing something obvious). So another package would have to take over, but I can&#x27;t find one other than the ones integrated for lsp-mode.
 Has anyone been able to have some kind of code lens with eglot? I&#x27;m open to suggestions!

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am an Emacs newbie, using it now for ~2months, and I am still with my mouth open everyday on how amazing it is. Thanks to all the people that have worked hard on Emacs and also plugin creators!!!
 I have created my own config from scratch after having used Doom briefly and Prelude extensively. This is working far better, and it&#x27;s teaching me a lot.
 On a side note, I would really appreciate feedback into how this config can be improved, best practices, better choices, etc.
 See my config here: https://github.com/averageflow/dotfiles/tree/master/joeTumbleweedIKEADell/emacs
 I use a variety of packages, including consult, marginalia, vertico, corfu and orderless, use-package with straight.
 I love orderless, and when I manually enable it, works wonderful, but for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t get properly activated in my setup (init.el) when following the documentation:
 (use-package orderless :custom (setq completion-styles &#x27;(orderless basic) completion-category-overrides &#x27;((file (styles basic partial-completion)))) ) 
 When I do (print completion-styles) it gives me just (basic). Somehow it gets overriden I think ?
 I&#x27;ve also tried to change that :custom by :config and to use the setq outside the use-package block, to no avail.
 So I have had to resort to
 (custom-set-variables &#x27;(completion-styles &#x27;(orderless basic)) ) 
 And this seems to work. But how can I / should I get rid of it this way? 
 Why doesn&#x27;t it work in the use-package declaration? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting to the point in working with my ZK that I have re-visited certain zettels several times - whether that is just to read the zettel or to &quot;finish&quot; it (if it was still in rough form, having the tag &quot;#unfinished&quot;), or to add information from new sources.  There could be numerous reasons.
My point, though, is that I don&#x27;t always want to update (or &quot;refactor&quot;) a zettel; sometimes I just want to (legitimately) expand it.  I&#x27;ve started adding dates to the new material and some zettels now appear as:
Date 1 (UUID) with original material.
Date 2 with new material.
Date 3 with even newer material.
This approach has an added advantage in that it allows me to see a progression in an idea - what did I write initially and what are my thoughts now?
Has anyone else implemented this practice?  If so, what is your experience with it?  Whether you have or not, do you see any potential benefits from doing this?  Any drawbacks?</span>

                              <span>I recently purchased &quot;Learn Physics with Functional Programming&quot; mainly because it involved doing 2D and 3D graphics which are topics I would like to learn more about in Haskell. For the 2D part it uses the gloss package which I built and ran without any problems. However, for the 3D part it uses the package not-gloss which seems to not be maintained anymore. When I try to build it using cabal I get the following error:
 [ 5 of 10] Compiling Data.Pair ( src/Data/Pair.hs, dist/build/Data/Pair.o, dist/build/Data/Pair.dyn_o )
 src/Data/Pair.hs:98:10: error: • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Monoid_f (Flip j o) (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this) • In the instance declaration for ‘Pair (Flip j o)’ | 98 | instance (Arrow j, Monoid_f (Flip j o)) &#x3D;&gt; | cabal: Failed to build TypeCompose-0.9.14 (which is required by exe:LearnPhysics from LearnPhysics-0.1.0.0). See the build log above for details.
 I tried enable FlexibleContexts in my .cabal file but nothing changed. I am not sure where to go from here and any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I tend to program with Rust/Ocaml/Python/PHP etc. But I just love the Haskell Language.
 The only thing that has been a deal killer for me so far has been laziness.
 Reading https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-12-strict-vs-lazy/ further convinced me that laziness just causes too much grief.
 I am eager to write strict Haskell. I understand the the -XStrict and Unlifted datatypes help with this. Actually it is interesting that -XStrict does not really cut it, we need unlifted datatypes..
 However, I want to be able to use libraries and preludes that assume everything is strict and/or unlifted.
 Is it possible in 2022 to write Haskell as it if it was a strict language like, say, OCaml? However, where are the strict monad transformer libraries, strict by default preludes etc. Every notable library seems to be lazy...
 I like Purescript -- a dialect of Haskell that is pure and strict. However, Purescript does not have such a lively ecosystem, mature tooling etc. like Haskell.
 I would love to be writing Haskell with Purescript like semantics. Any suggestions?

                              <span>The repo and explanatory blog post for the safe-money library are currently returning a 404, and it seems like the author has made a number of other repos private (or removed them). Does anybody know what&#x27;s up? I was under the impression that safe-money was a relatively popular library so I&#x27;m a bit surprised to see it sort of disappear like this.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve packaged GHC primitives like fetchAddIntArray# which expose atomic operations into sinle package that exposes a type isomorphic to IORef Int and supports a few operations that mutate it.
 For a common use case of multiple threads incrementing a counter it works surprisingly faster that TVar, MVar or ever plain IORef. Even more surprisingly, this counter is a faster single-threaded mutable integer cell than IORef. If you&#x27;re curious, benchmarks are on github.

                              <span>I&#x27;m completely new to Haskell, but as far as databases go I&#x27;m a big fan of Cassandra. I do see libraries for it but it seems really unclear how to actually use it.
 But since I&#x27;m completely new to the language instead of trying the climb mountains perhaps I should start with something more typical to wet my whistle.
 So what databases are the most natural to use in Haskell?

                              <span>I’m trying to implement the technique of creating “piles” of headings to mimic how people cluster papers together on physical desktops. This is distinguished from categorizing with labels in that it leverages spatial location.
 I seem to recall coming across a package that put coordinates into a property value and then could display the headings in a corkboard or desktop type view.
 It may have been a brainstorming package, or maybe a plotting package, but I can’t seem to find it, does anyone know of a package with a feature like this?

                              <span>Hi r/scala, I would like to ask if any of you have encountered this problem before
 While programming in Scala, whenever I encounter certain types of situations that would have thrown an exception while programming in Java don&#x27;t seem to be throwing any exceptions in Scala.
 A very simple example that doesn&#x27;t throw an exception for me is:
 val list &#x3D; (0 to 5).toList println(list(10)) 
 Surely this should generate an IndexOutOfBoundsException?
 Another example:
 val mappy &#x3D; Map(&quot;a&quot; -&gt; 5) println(mappy(&quot;b&quot;)) 
 This also does not throw any exceptions.
 My Scala version is 3.2.1, and my intellij version is IntelliJ IDEA Edu 2022.2.2 using the Scala plugin, and my project type is an SBT project generated by intellij, incase any of that is relevant.
 I have also tried messing with the intellij settings, turning on stuff like &quot;prohibited exception thrown&quot; since I saw online that something like that might help, but I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet. I&#x27;m thinking about trying to throw out my entire scala plugin &amp; installs and try again from scratch, but I figured I&#x27;d ask here first.
 ​
 Thank you very much

 Main changes from 0.9.12:
  
Implemented support for returning clause inside an async block: https://rssh.github.io/dotty-cps-async/ReturningClause.html
 Few bug fixes and workarounds against the 3.2.1 compiler behavior.
  
Also, support for probability monad (https://github.com/jliszka/probability-monad ) is added to cps-async-connect. Now it is possible to do probabilistic programming in scala with direct style: https://github.com/rssh/cps-async-connect/blob/master/probability-monad/src/test/scala/cps/monads/probability/ProbabilityExamplesSuite.scala )

 Anyone have any thoughts on how I did? Any suggestions for making better use of parallelism, or expressing it better?

                              <span>This is a cross-post from Discourse. The summary is: If I use GHC 8.10.7 with modern-uri then Nix picks a version of that package that&#x27;s incompatible with the base of that GHC. Cabal works just fine. Am I missing something? I know that I can override the modern-uri that&#x27;s used in pkgs.haskell.compiler.ghc810 but then I basically need to play human constraint solver.

                              <span>I decided to upgrade to ghc 9.2.5 now that hls 1.9.0.0 is out, however I&#x27;m having an extremely difficult time figuring out what exactly I need to change in my current project to make it work. 
 The project builds correctly when I have 8.10.7 set as default with ghcup as well as when I swap back to it after trying to get 9.2.5 to work. When I set the default to 9.2.5 and start VSCode with the project folder, hls errors and says that it can&#x27;t determine what compiler version should be used, which is fair I guess, but again I have no idea what I need to change because there isn&#x27;t any information in the .cabal file about what compiler version to use.
 When I try to build the project, I get this error
 cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: ghc-pkg dump failed: dieVerbatim: user error (cabal-3.6.2.0.exe: &#x27;C:\ghcup\bin\ghc-pkg.exe&#x27; exited with an error: ghc-pkg-9.2.5.exe: C:\\cabal\\store\\ghc-9.2.5\\package.db\package.cache: withBinaryFile: inappropriate type (not enough bytes) 
 and almost all of the solutions/advice I&#x27;ve been able to find online for dealing with that have to do with stack which I&#x27;m not using. The one that wasn&#x27;t about stack said to delete the project folder and clone it again from github but doing that didn&#x27;t work.
 Any help would be deeply appreciated. If the solution is to just uninstall everything including ghcup and reinstall with only 9.2.5, is there something I should change about the .cabal file in the project before I do that to make sure it works correctly after reinstalling?

                              <span>Hi,
 Recently I posted how could I figure out the face variable for LSP breadcrumbs. I solved it.
 I hope the following is helpful.
 TL;DR
  
Even non-elisp hackers can understand elisp. Don&#x27;t be intimidated.
 Thank you /u/CorysInTheHouse69 for the nudge.
  
Details
 /u/CorysInTheHouse69, politely, repeatedly mentioned I should consult the underlying code. They were right, that&#x27;s the right approach. Even for a non-elisp hacker, one can see patterns!
 I found the pattern in the doom theme (doom-themes-base.el) base code and saw the line (header-line :inherit &#x27;mode-line) That is, the header line is matching my mode line. That&#x27;s not what I wanted! Boom!
 Walking up the code, I see the following comment:
 ;;; Code: ;; These are used as a basis for every Doom theme defined with &#x60;def-doom-theme&#x27;, ;; as a set of reasonble defaults. They are intended to be overidden where it ;; makes sense to. 
 operative word overridden!
 In my init.el I override (header-line and now, I have what I want. \o/
 Here&#x27;s an example of my unit test:
 (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won&#x27;t work right. ... &#x27;(header-line ((t (:background &quot;blue&quot; :foreground &quot;black&quot;)))) ...) 
 Go forth and hack!

 Since I&#x27;m starting to purge gpg out of my life, but do depend on it heavily for keeping my org notes and authinfo encrypted, I needed an epa/epg-style transparent encryption support for age (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). As such I ported the relevant epa/epg code and reworked it to work with age. 
 age.el provides transparent encryption and decryption support for .age files in Emacs, much like epa/epg support .gpg files. That means you can do all the things with .age files you&#x27;re used to doing with .gpg files in Emacs now.
 Like most of my packages, this is mostly written to support my personal use cases, but I&#x27;ve seen some other folks mention that they wanted to start using age over gpg, so have a look if this seems useful to you.

 emacs -Q --script build-site.el 
 It used to work properly, yet greedy as I am I decided to implement a couple of new features, and to achieve that functionality I decided to install straight.el:

                              <span>According to some post I read the behaviour of defvar has been changed in that it will set the value of an already set variable if the variable is used again in a defvar.
 I use defvar declarations in order not to get assignment to free variable errors and I wouldn&#x27;t want the existing values to be reset.
 I can&#x27;t find the exact post where I read this but if this is what I think it means it may cause me some problems.
 Can anyone clarify it?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a long persisting issue I&#x27;d rather get rid of if anyone can point me in the right direction. When I first start Emacs (whether directly or as a client) my screen is extremely compressed (screenshot below). If I reload configuration it displays normally.
 I am currently on 28.2 but this has persisted from 27.x. You can probably just make out in the screenshot that this is Doom emacs just in case that has any relevance.
 Here is the screenshot:

 Searches do not yield any help that I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;m honestly not sure where to look.
 Thanks in advance.

How do you take manual bib notes when reading from an ebook, that doesn&#x27;t have page numbers? My ebook reader does have what I guess you&#x27;d call &quot;screen numbers&quot;, but those change if I change the font size.  How do you reference a particular location in a book when page numbers are not available to you?</span>

14 New Zettel in the Last 7 Days.
I whipped up this short dashboard practicing my python skills and thought I&#x27;d share it with you. I use something similar for reviewing note titles and summaries. Something I want to concentrate on more.
Titles and a one-sentence summary of atomic zettel. These are the ideas I&#x27;m currently wrestling with. They represent a 7-day window of new notes.
This is generated with nothing held back. I would love to talk to you about anything on this list. If any of this is of interest to you, please start a thread here, DM me, or get in touch via email.

When I force quit the app, the file is then deleted from Google Drive or Dropbox. I can also delete the file from finder and The Archive picks up the changes.
I&#x27;m using the latest download of The Archive on on a Mac M1 Pro, Mac OS Ventura 13.1
Anyone had similar or know anything I could try.</span>

                              <span>I have a little puzzle for the Haskell community.
 Lately I&#x27;ve been experimenting with tagless final encodings (or object algebras in other languages) to build ASTs where previously I would have used a recursive ADT.
 This works great if you have a simple untyped AST. New terms can be added to the AST by adding a new typeclass that extends the base one. 
 However, what you have an AST presented with a GADT, with the types of your language encoded as a data-kinded parameter? You can still encode your AST in a tagless final way by using a higher-kinded type as the carrier, and this (as before) let&#x27;s us extend the terms of the language, but what if we want to extend the types?
 For instance, if we have a base AST for a simply typed lambda calculus, and we want to add products, we need both a new type constructor, and some new terms of our AST itself.
 Yet (as far as I know), it&#x27;s not possible to use something like a tagless final encoding at the type level.
 Has anyone thought about solving this kind of problem? My only thought was that this might be easier to do in something like Agda or Idris, but I&#x27;m curious what a solution to this in Haskell might look like.

                              <span>I tried to write a function that calculate log safely (exercise in Haskell Wikibook). Here&#x27;s what I came up with:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a safeLog x &#x3D; log x  0) 
 Then I tried to rewrite it in point-free style. After some tinkering, I came up with this version:
 safeLog :: (Floating a, Ord a) &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a safeLog &#x3D; ap (( 0)) 
 The function works correctly; however, I don&#x27;t understand how it works (specifically the concrete type of ap). Haskell language server showed that the concrete type of ap is:
 _ :: (a -&gt; Maybe () -&gt; Maybe a) -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe ()) -&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a 
 The generalized type of ap is:
 forall (m :: * -&gt; *) a b. Monad m &#x3D;&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b 
 As I understand it, ap requires a function, a type a and b all wrapped in Monad m. For example, if I have this function:
 foo &#x3D; ap (Just (+ 1)) (Just 2) 
 I understand that the concrete type of Monad m here is Maybe, and the concrete type of a and b is Integer. i.e.:
 _ :: Maybe (Integer -&gt; Integer) -&gt; Maybe Integer -&gt; Maybe Integer 
 But in the case of ap inside safeLog:
 _ :: (a -&gt; Maybe () -&gt; Maybe a) -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe ()) -&gt; a -&gt; Maybe a 
 I cannot figure out what is the concrete type of Monad m, a and b.

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading about arrays (Data.Array). 1D array construction is easy.  a &#x3D; listArray (4, 8) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  creates an array with minimum index 4, maximum index 8, a ! 4 &#x3D; 2, and so on.
 But I came across the following code for constructing a 2D array, and having a hard time understanding it.  xss &#x3D; [ [9, 8, 7] , [5, 3, 2] , [6, 6, 7] ] matrix &#x3D; listArray ((1, 1), (3, 3)) (concat xss) 
 What is the (1, 1) for? I can see how nine integers can be split into 3 rows and 3 columns without needing the (1, 1).
 The only material even discussing 2D array type is this, and sadly it doesn&#x27;t answer my question.

                              <span>Edit: Apologies for posting in this sub, as it is only partly Haskell-related. I&#x27;m not sure where else to discuss such things.
 One of my interests in programming is the analysis of techniques used to employ better coding practices. For example, in OOP you have design patterns that adhere to design principles such as SOLID. To further the example, you can design a factory with SOLID practices considered to create code that is &quot;clean&quot;, allowing for code reusability, and flexibility. In short, with minimal code smell.
 I am currently reading Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler to get a better understanding of things I&#x27;ve come to learn from practice and experience in a more well-presented context.
 I am wondering if some similar texts or resources focus on the functional style of code refactoring and reusability. I understand that many topics and techniques are simple enough to work in all contexts, but I also know that FP languages have their smells and without getting various kinds of experience (which may be difficult to do), I was hoping that I can learn of such topics.
 FP is naturally an abstract paradigm, going miles more than most OOP languages, and I want to be able to strongly analyse such topics in depth. I have moderate experience with Haskell, but due to university studies and life, I don&#x27;t have the opportunity to focus more effort than I do, learning the various libraries and tools available to build a repertoire of skills from applied experience.
 Thank you very much

range-pattern - Range pattern for pcase
 random-generators - Functions to generate random numbers and data structures
 generators - Functions to generate data structures
  
But the most interesting part was understanding how to extend pcase. :) I am open to any suggestions and I am going to create more plugins for Emacs to enhance my and others experience while learning new things.

 So i wrote mini-script with M-x &quot;eshell-run&quot; and &quot;eshell-rerun&quot; commands.
 If anyone is interested i will create github repo and will probably try to turn this into a full package.

                              <span>So for my previous year, I used LibreOffice Writer which sufficed well enough for using symbols as well as sub and super script but since then I’ve discovered my dearest Doom Emacs and kinda fell in love with Org Mode; y’know how the story goes. My current problem mostly is I’d really love to use Org Mode for my Math Notes but I don’t know how to insert symbols or structure things like larger division statements, or anything with how to insert functions.
 I’ve heard things about LaTeX being the optimal way to get this done; seemingly Emacs should have some integration with this but I don’t entirely know where to start with that and I don’t actually know a thing about LaTeX so I was wondering if anyone could offer me guidance on how to achieve the optimal note-taking Emacs setup, and just how you lovely lads would go about this?

                              <span>Hi, I am migration from org-ref to using the built-in citations in Org Mode. I am having some trouble properly exporting to LaTeX / PDF.
 This is my MWE:
 #+title: Testing org-cite \LaTeX export #+latex_header: \usepackage{natbib} #+bibliography: r4h2o.bib #+options: toc:nil #+cite_export: natbib Hello World! This is a citation: [cite:@alghamdi_2022_clas] #+print_bibliography: +end_export 
 I get an error message: &quot;Unknown processor natbib&quot;
 Exporting with the basic exporter works fine. CSL is also problematic.
 The Org Mode manual is a bit cryptic on this functionality.
 Anyone can help fixing this issue?
 P.S: I used a clean Emacs instance (emacs -q), no config.

                              <span>So I want direnv to automatically do its direnv thing whenever I open a vterm. Let us say I have:
  
Configured direnv and my .bashrc as normal.
 Configured nix-direnv on NixOS by modifying configuration.nix as normal.
 Configured emacs&#x27; configuration for emacs-direnv as normal.
  
Now consider I have:
  
Make some directory /tmp/xyz, made a shell.nix or flake.nix file, and done either echo &quot;use nix&quot; &gt;&gt; .envrc &amp;&amp; direnv allow or echo &quot;use flake&quot; &gt;&gt; .envrc &amp;&amp; direnv allow as appropriate.
  
Then, every time I open a file, emacs-direnv direnvs in its direnv way, successfully, much to my happiness. I vterm and cd to my file and direnv also direnvs successfully.
 Let us now say I do M-x cd /tmp/xyz, wherein I have stored some .envrc and shell.nix (or flake.nix or whatever) files. Opening a file direnvs successfully. However, opening a vterm sometimes does nothing, whereupon I must first cd out of my directory and cd back into my directory.
 For some reason this happens inconsistently. Does anyone else have this problem? It seems only to occur with flake.nix files and not shell.nix files.

                              <span>Hi.
 Is there an emacs distribution, which upon startup would present itself as a full-featured organizer?
 What I&#x27;m looking for is something opinionated, not necessarily easily configurable even, but something that works and does the job¹ out of the box.
 ¹ the job I define as something done by conventional organizers (todoist, ticktick), namely:
 - manage todo tasks
 - attach text notes to tasks
 - set date on tasks
 - set tags on tasks
 - agenda view
 - calendar view
 - maybe something like org-gcal?
 - preferably evil mode
 I&#x27;m willing to invest only minimal effort into learning this opinionated way of using org-mode. I&#x27;m not interested in the endless feature-set emacs can offer. I may decide to tinker with the setup later. But I don&#x27;t want to do all the learning upfront.
 Does a distribution like this exist?

                              <span>I will preface by saying I use DOOM emacs.
 I have a use case where I&#x27;d like to link an image inside an org document for viewing inline, but would also like it to be suppressed upon export to PDF. 
 I&#x27;m aware of two solutions that are unsatisfactory: linking the image in a #+begin_comment #+end_comment block, or adding the image under a subheading with the :noexport: tag.
 The first is not enough since placing an image link inside a comment block prevents org recognizing it to be viewed inline, while the second is unsatisfactory because it would mess with the formatting of the document. I.e. I would have to escape the noexport subheading for every image (I confess I don&#x27;t know how to do this if there is a method). Is there any way to get the desired behavior?

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing a deep dive into a product management framework, where I&#x27;m breaking down the necessary knowledge within each phase of that framework so that I can both produce better strategic &amp; planning documents for my team and to write blog posts to teach other product managers how to operate within this framework.
Image of Framework for Reference
It&#x27;s unclear to me how to productively capture this framework &amp; begin developing out within my Zettelkasten.  I&#x27;ve kept my ZK for ~6 months now, so I&#x27;m familiar with the framework (both from notes workflow &amp; ideas workflow perspectives).
Currently, I&#x27;m considering this method:
Create a note that contains the flowchart itself.
Branch off of this note by creating a new note for each Phase &amp; each document.
Dive into the methodologies &amp; techniques required at each Phase from there.
Am I on the right track?  Is there anything obvious that I&#x27;m missing here?</span>

 I&#x27;m trying purescript for the first-time and I&#x27;m using spago to manage dependencies and building. I&#x27;m compiling my purescript modules with spago, and I want to use them in a typescript codebase. I&#x27;m looding type information (of course) when compiling to javascript. 
 How would I proceed if I want to keep type informations on my compiled module ? Is there a way to generate d.ts for each module when building with spago ? Any advice about that ? 
 Thx :)

                              <span>I have been trying to diagnose this issue for quite a while, and I was hoping that someone more experienced may be able to provide some help.
 My current setup is Linux + neovim (using the built in LSP) + GHC 9.2.5 + cabal 3.6.2.0 + HLS 1.9.0.0 + stack 2.7.3.
 The issue that I&#x27;m having is that while I&#x27;m in my editor, HLS will not show me compiler warnings. Other than that HLS pretty works entirely fine, I&#x27;m getting hlint hints, I can rename variables, jump to definitions, and I get code completions etc. Just no compiler warnings.
 I have verified that the server is running, and that my editor is connecting properly. I have an explicit hie.yaml. I am having this issue on all of the Haskell code I open. I have used GHCup to reinstall and build HLS from source. At this point I am at a dead end, so any leads would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>As far as I know there is no way to implement a mutual (or &quot;duplicate&quot;) constructor for two different data types in Haskell.
 For example, this hypothetical code will not work:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data family Prim data family (a ~~&gt; b)
 data instance Prim where Lit :: Int -&gt; Prim
 data instance a ~~&gt; b where Plus :: Prim ~~&gt; Prim ~~&gt; Prim
 -- A hypothetical data instance where either t is Prim, OR, t is (a &gt; b) data instance (t ~ Prim | t ~ (a ~~&gt; b)) &#x3D;&gt; t where -- Apply is a mutual constructor for both Prim and (&gt;), -- The result type depends on the type of the first constructor argument Apply :: (x ~~&gt; t) -&gt; x -&gt; t &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 The best alternative I can come up with is 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Prim where Lit :: Int -&gt; Prim CastToPrim :: Apply Prim -&gt; Prim -- &quot;UnApply&quot; the type constructor, so to speak
 data a ~~&gt; b where Plus :: Prim ~~&gt; Prim ~~&gt; Prim CastToArrow :: Apply (a ~~&gt; b) -&gt; (a ~~&gt; b)
 data Apply t where Apply :: (x ~~&gt; t) -&gt; x -&gt; Apply t &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Possibly with some pattern synonyms for convenience... (but this doesn&#x27;t help much) 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell pattern ApplyPartial f x &#x3D; CastToArrow (Apply f x) pattern ApplyFinal f x &#x3D; CastToPrim (Apply f x)
 two :: Prim two &#x3D; ApplyFinal (ApplyPartial Plus (Lit 1)) (Lit 2) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I was wondering if anyone has alternative ideas for this sort of thing (or knows of examples in other languages).

                              <span>The Beam packages rely on a certain naming scheme and this includes to precede each record field with an underscore which is common in the lens world. But I have serious reasons not to do so. Is there a *simple* way to configure the Beam maschinery accordingly that does not include renaming each field by hand?

                              <span>I know this post is for a very geographically specific subset of this subreddit, but I don&#x27;t know a better place to ask.
 Let me say up front: I do not have a job to offer, and am not even in a position to do so. But I would like to gauge potential interest in working professionally with Haskell in the company where I am employed. They currently develop mainly in .Net, C#, but a couple of years ago I was allowed to build a backend application in F# with a small team (kind of as a compromise for developing in a functional programming language but still using the .Net framework).
 For performance reasons, maintainability and ease of bug fixing, I recently suggested we look into migrating that application to Haskell. But with me being the only person currently who knows the language, my manager sees the low bus factor as a (very understandable) risk.
 We don&#x27;t want to post a vacancy for Haskell developers at the moment, as a decision to use the language has not been made. But I would like to show by numbers how many developers we could potentially attract /if/ we were to do so. Or at least: how many people would be interested in working with Haskell in our reasonably direct surroundings.
 So my question is: are you, or do you know, a developer in the province of Limburg in The Netherlands, who would be interested in working with Haskell professionally? Or is there a better place to ask this question? If you don&#x27;t want to disclose your location publicly in this subreddit, you can always DM me, of course.
 If nothing else, we might just find out how many we are, and could form a local user group out of this.
 Thanks for your time reading this!

                              <span>i wanted to try effectful however it doesn&#x27;t have integration with haskell gi and i do not want to use IO in all my code, so i am creating an effect for haskell gi. 
 Upon starting doing so i noticed a pattern when wrapping a monadic function, it has the same type with some changes ,in the context instead of MonadIO it has GI :&gt; es and the return type is Eff es a instead of m a , and in the term level it is also simple it uses all arguments from the original calls the original and then unsafeEff_s it like so function a b c &#x3D; unsafeEff_ $ Original.function a b c. 
 Naturally i tried to automate it as this is quite simple in pseudocode, i first thought
 about using typefamilies and functions however although i probably could do a lifting function i can&#x27;t create new top-level declarations with only typefamilies so i tried to use some template haskell.
 However traversing a template haskell syntax tree is absolute hell, i tried to combine it with typefamilies to generate the types more comfortably and it mostly worked until i needed to do the pattern for the clause, to apply the type families i would need a splice to turn my syntax tree in types, however i can&#x27;t splice from the same module so i gave up on template haskell if there isn&#x27;t an alternative i probably will come back eventually but i absolutely hated the experience.
 i hated the experience so much that i am considering forking haskell gi to create the functions already wrapped

                              <span>Hi,
 Is there a way to make certain abbreviations straightforward, without the use of extra keys? Here&#x27;s an approximation: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; (defun abbrev-or-insert () (interactive) (self-insert-command 1) (expand-abbrev))
 (define-abbrev-table &#x27;global-abbrev-table &#x27;( (&quot;HH&quot; &quot;---~&quot; nil :case-fixed t :count 0) (&quot;LL&quot; &quot;\ldots{}&quot; nil :case-fixed t :count 0) (&quot;ДД&quot; &quot;\ldots{}&quot; nil :case-fixed t :count 0) ))
 (global-set-key (kbd &quot;Д&quot;) &#x27;abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;H&quot;) &#x27;abbrev-or-insert) (global-set-key (kbd &quot;L&quot;) &#x27;abbrev-or-insert)  It works as desired; well, almost:  \ldots{}\ldots{}арпДД \ldots{}\ldots{} \ldots{}abaLL \ldots{}\ldots{}booLL &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Somehow, any input after the expansion of the abbreviation is disruptive. It takes a space to make it work again. Is there a way to get rid of that space?

 I&#x27;ve used most Elisp syntax and the many styles of input in traditional Emacs commands, making this guide a great way to expand your knowledge of writing Emacs user interfaces as well. Use this guide for the context necessary to illustrate transient&#x27;s manual, its source, and the Magit source that uses it heavily.
 The most important Excerpt
 A user input sequence like this:
 Prefix -&gt; Interactive -&gt; Sub-Prefix -&gt; Infix -&gt; Suffix -&gt; Suffix -&gt; ... 
 Is basically the same as doing this in elisp:
 (let ((input (Sub-Prefix (Prefix (Interactive)))) (infix (Infix))) (suffix input infix) (suffix input infix)) 
 However, by using history to fill out most of the forms, transient inputs utilize state to maximize the …</span>

So far so good. 
 Most major modes seem to have their own version of that variable however, which means that you would need to add the variable to each major mode you want to use the capf for. Ok, but not really ideal. 
 There&#x27;s another thing at play here; out of the box, the value of completion-at-point-functions in emacs-lisp-mode is (elisp-completion-at-point t); the t here apparently indicates that if elisp-completion-at-point fails, it should fall back to the next function in the global completion-at-point-functions. That would be good enough, but…</span>

I get that vimscript is really bad, but now nvim using lua would bring vim to the same level of customization as emacs. Am I correct in assume that?
 And just to narrow down the discussion, I&#x27;m looking just into the text editing part. The whole kitchen sink thing is not my vibe.

 I&#x27;d appreciate if someone could help me do this. I suppose this should be easy for someone who knows. Currently, I have flymake, which according to my understanding uses flake8. I am not super happy about it.

                              <span>So I love vterm 99% of the time, but there are a few things that are annoying
 - If I need to use brew install, I can&#x27;t do it in emacs. It just says &#x60;brew not found&#x60;. So I have to switch into iterm and then brew install from there. I don&#x27;t use brew much at all, but when I need it it&#x27;s annoying that vterm or any of emacs&#x27; shell tools can&#x27;t find it. 
 - Vterm doesn&#x27;t have access to the kill ring. If I try to M-y anything from the kill ring vterm says &#x60;Buffer is read only&#x60;, which it certainly isn&#x27;t. 
 - Using the universal modifier to include a string of digits doesn&#x27;t work: C-u 12 C-u 0 should insert 12 &quot;0&quot;s, but it just inserts 1. 
 There are other gripes but these are the three top of mind. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing about vterm, but I can&#x27;t find any way to correct these issues which frustrates me since I&#x27;m now so used to everything working seamlessly everywhere else. If anyone has ideas for solutions to these problems, I&#x27;m all ears :)

                              <span>So I am building an emacs client for Nostr, and am starting off with the key and signatures which use SECP256K1 from bitcoin. There is a lisp package: https://github.com/dvush/cl-secp256k1 which provides the ability to create keys and sign messages. I would like to be able to define some functions in my elisp file that would call certain methods from this package, say to create a private key. My question is really how to do this... is it even worth doing it this way, or just force the user to install a C implementation of the package and then get elisp to run that. Any thoughts or insights very much appreciated :)

                              <span>Empirical process control is a quality control method that involves continuously collecting data and using it to monitor and improve a process. In the context of a Zettelkasten system, empirical process control could be used to continually evaluate and refine the organization and use of the system in order to maximize its effectiveness and efficiency.
Some potential benefits of using empirical process control for a Zettelkasten system include:
Improved organization: By continuously collecting and analyzing data on how the Zettelkasten system is being used, it may be possible to identify patterns and trends that can be used to improve the organization of the system. This could involve reorganizing existing notes, creating new connections between notes, or adding new categories or tags to he…</span>

                              <span>Hi I am trying to configure org-agenda to pull from multiple directories. I was able to find this code on stack overflow. That works, but I don&#x27;t understand what is needed to add a second, or list of source directories to it. 
 (setq org-agenda-files (directory-files-recursively &quot;~/Dir-1/&quot; &quot;\\.org$&quot;)) 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing almost all my written communication in org-files exported to PDF&#x27;s, so I write in org-mode, and then use export to PDF&#x27;s to send to people.
 I have this annoying problem, that every time I want to export one file, the system will convert all files in the directory will also be exported. This give two problems, first of all, it can take a while to get them all exported, and I may get an error in a file, I had not wanted to export.
 Is there a switch to tell emacs/org/ox-latex, that I only need to export the current file?

                              <span>I searched for a solution to capture/reject/accept/send calendar invitations with emacs/notmuch and org-mode. I found one older solution on reddit which was not working right out of the box, but I adjusted it to a working solution (at least for emacs 27). 
 You can find the changes in following repository
 - https://github.com/hokreb/notmuch-calendar-x
 for everybody to use. 
 I am not sure, if the timezone handling is correct, for usage within German timezone, I does not find any problem. 
 Any improvements for the solution are welcome.

                              <span>In my post face picker? post, I had two questions. One of which was answered. The other, I&#x27;m hoping there&#x27;s a better alternative than inspecting the code.
 I&#x27;m using LSP breadcrumbs and I&#x27;d like to change the background of the breadcrumbs - see sample.
 Unfortunately, I cannot place point on the line so I cannot use describe-face.
 Is there a way to get the face variable without inspecting the underlying elisp code?

 You guys have probably gotten tons of people asking this same question but I&#x27;m gonna ask once more, since no matter what example I&#x27;m using it always loses me. 
 Running a simple expression as the one above gives me a parse error everytime. I&#x27;ve used different example expressions as this one, mostly ones from Philipp Hagenlocher&#x27;s Haskell for Imperative Programmers tutorial. It&#x27;s an excellent tutorial, but the examples from the tutorials always give me compile errors about common syntax like &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27; sign &amp; the &#x27;|&#x27; sign. Most commonly, I get this error: 
 Main.hs:6:28: error: parse error on input ‘&#x3D;’ Perhaps you need a &#x27;let&#x27; in a &#x27;do&#x27; block? e.g. &#x27;let x &#x3D; 5&#x27; instead of &#x27;x &#x3D; 5&#x27; 
 I&#x27;ve tried different examples outside the tutorial, some stack overflow corrections of other people&#x27;s code who&#x27;ve had similar errors to me. There was only one time where I did NOT get a parse error on compile time. Everything else has been a parse error on &#x27;&#x3D;&#x27;, &#x27;|&#x27; or something else. Why does the compiler punish me for using simple syntax like this? Is this a software issue I&#x27;m having or am I really doing something wrong? Cuz this is driving me nuts.

                              <span>Currently working on an assignment and struggling a bit with my runtime analysis.
  data GTree a &#x3D; GNil | GNode a [GTree a] deriving Show testGTree :: (Num a) &#x3D;&gt; GTree a testGTree &#x3D; GNode 4 [GNode 5 [GNode 3 [], GNode 51 []], GNode 6 [GNode 10 []], GNode 7 [GNode 12 [GNode 4124 []]]] postOrderG :: GTree a -&gt; [a] postOrderG (GNode x []) &#x3D; [x] postOrderG (GNode a (t:ts)) &#x3D; postOrderG t ++ help ts ++ [a] where help [] &#x3D; [] help ts &#x3D; help (drop 1 ts) ++ postOrderG (head ts) 
 As you can see the function is supposed to traverse a tree with any number of children in postorder (which it hopefully does). Im struggling how i can get a O Notation. I thought id calculate with each node having a set number of children m (which is the max number of children in the tree) as a worst case. But how do I deal with the subfunction help calling on the main function (postOrderG (head ts))?
 postOrderG t runs with c&#x27; (c &#x3D; runtime of postOrderG (GNode x []) &#x3D; [x]) + runtime of help rest of list + runtime of postorder first child. But now we have postorder again ! 
 I dont want the answer but any tips would be welcome! And oc happy christmas to you all.

unfoldr builds a list from a seed value. The function takes the element and returns Nothing if it is done producing the list or returns Just (a,b), in which case, a is a prepended to the list and b is used as the next element in a recursive call.

unfoldr (\b -&gt; if b &#x3D;&#x3D; 0 then Nothing else Just (b, b-1)) 10 [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]  I understand this, no problem.  takeWhile (&gt; 0) $ L.unfoldr (\b -&gt; Just (b, b-1)) 10 [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] &#x60;&#x60; I don&#x27;t understand this. It seems the input totakeWhileisa&#x60;, but how?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on this exercise matrix, which is creating a matrix from a string, and implementing various operations on it. A string 1 2\n3 4 should return a 2x2 matrix [[1,2], [3,4]]. My code is as below, and it passes all the test cases. I&#x27;m wondering though if it can be improved, especially the fromString and transpose functions.
 fromString first splits by newline and then by whitespace to create a [[String]]. It then goes over each element converting it to a (Int in the tests). This doesn&#x27;t look like idiomatic Haskell to me. I looked at mapM, thinking it might help, but couldn&#x27;t find a way to apply it.

                              <span>hello! for some context: i have been dabbling a little with haskell by myself, so my experience is quite limited... for the most part it has been a really enjoyable experience! but i&#x27;ve come across some unexpected behaviour, and i cannot, by the life of me, reason why:
 specifically im working with an infinite list generated by a function called zip_iterate, which basically takes a list of functions([a]-&gt;[a]) and a list [a] and applies the first function to the given input, then takes its result and uses it as input of the second function, and so on &amp; so forth
 my question is related to &#x60;final_next&#x60;: on the do main function i define it, the code runs quite faster (half time needed approximately) than if i don&#x27;t
 i would expect that evaluating a list at a specific position would be faster t…</span>

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 It is well known that many Scala users are keen to get better tooling. Some weeks ago, I had the chance to try Vercel and started wondering about why Scala does not have something like this.
 After thinking for a bit, I got to the conclusion that Vercel&#x27;s preview environments are not really hard to implement. Then, I put my hands into this and created an integration for one of our projects: https://github.com/wiringbits/scala-webapp-template/pull/299
 While the integration is still being tested, it has worked nicely for the past few days, we&#x27;ll continue to test it in our private projects in the coming months.
 If you want to try breaking it? just submit a dummy PR and github will create a preview environment for your change.

                              <span>My comment:
The issue of creating fiction into the system is that you deligate an ability to an external system that can and should be a skill of the person, you prevent the development of this skill. That decreases or perhaps even inhibits the training effect working with a ZK has or could have.
Folgezettel is a very valid and perhaps necessary technique that makes working as if you have a project you are working on. However, the most important counter-argument against the validity of Folgezettel is that you can achieve this with a better technique which is the structure note. Folgezettel allows to code for two different directions: lateral and horizontal. That means that you can&#x27;t map meaning on Folgezettel or are limited to two (or four if you count the opposite directions) categories of meaning. Structure notes on the other hand allow for as much of connection as you are able to produce on the canvas you use. What would been a cluster of Folgezettel can be a single drawn image on a Structure Note. Even when using a analog Zettelkaten my recommendation is the heavy use of Structure Notes since they pull together thoughts and their relationships on one single canvas.
In theory, the &quot;good enough relations&quot; are awesome. But in practice, from what I see, the good enough is mostly an in the moment idiosyncratic idea that you will forget in the future. When the future is now, many people have quite some difficulties to understand the relation or to see a relation at all. That is intrinsic to the concept of &quot;most what you produce is garbage&quot;. This includes the connections, direct and via Folgezettel. If you actually make it a point to get a grasp on the nature of connection you&#x27;ll build more robust (even antifragile) edges in your network.</span>

                              <span>Hello! I started making some posters for my room and I wanted to make one about Haskell. This is how it&#x27;s going:
 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTzeVhQybPwS0-xpIn454DM82aHC3ClLnz-0YU1Iva4/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing
 I&#x27;m actually somewhat of a beginner with Haskell so I would really appreciate if anyone would like to contribute to it! Be it proposing items to be added, suggesting changes, or just posting items with the given examples.
 For reference, here&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve made for Python: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1781eTQx0hVyA6rPNiAFuiIUo-ngdFTsS5fVE1f42ioc/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing
 Thanks !! 
 Edit: 
 If you&#x27;re a blessed soul who would like to write an entire new item, feel free to add it as a comment in this post!

                              <span>Hi, I just wrote my first full Haskell program in preparation for an exam in Haskell and functional programming (usually we just write single functions in class). I tried implementing the &quot;Hangman&quot; game in Haskell to get more familiar with the syntax and semantics.
 I would love some feedback on what I could&#x27;ve done differently/better since this whole thing is still new to me. Here is a link to the source code: https://gist.github.com/Pattrigue/ad8993ce4d4b7f5dcc895e05161989bf
 The &quot;words.txt&quot; file mentioned in the source code is just a word list I use to select a random word to use in the game, where the file contents are separated by newlines.
 Thank you! Hopefully it&#x27;s not too terrible :)

 I’ve been playing around with Yampa on Lego mindstorms. If you haven’t tried this, please do, it’s way way way too much fun (I can share some unfinished binding for the spike hub if you IM me)
 But I think it’s time to give this beast some eyes. I’m not very familiar with computer vision, so it’s going to be hard for me to make any kind of idiomatic arrow based abstraction, so I wondered if there was any high level combinators that worked with GHC 9+?
 All the best and merry Christmas :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how multicore works in Haskell, when I tried to run
 getNumProcessors &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print
 I can see it prints 4 on my computer, however when I add
 getNumCapabilities &gt;&gt;&#x3D; print
 It shows 1
 I do compile it with -threaded|, and run it withcabal run +RTS -N&#x60; flags, so I expected it would match. Maybe I have a wrong understanding of what is capability? Please help
 P.S. also tried setNumCapabilities 4, and then getNumCapabilities gives that value, but it feels wrong
 UPD: thanks everyone, I had to pass params not to cabal but to binary. Like this: cabal run . -- +RTS -N

 As you can see, Lens&#x27; is to products ((,)) what Codec is to sums (Either).
 Does my Codec correspond to some optic type in the lens library? And if so, is there a common &quot;supertype&quot; optic of both Lens&#x27; and Codec?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am spending a lot of time trying to track down the variable for a face which needs tweaking. Is there a recommended way to figure it out?
 For example, is there an emacs face picker? :)
 Similar to a color picker but a method that would allow me to pick the text under my mouse and expose the corresponding face variable?
 I am including a couple of screenshots of faces I would like to change. 
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>scan-error is a symbol created in syntax.c that appears to have a documentation string of &quot;Scan Error&quot; and other properties. describe-symbol doesn&#x27;t find it. apropos does. But this is really a more general question: how do I get the description of &quot;errors&quot;? describe-* doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything appropriate.

                              <span>We will make a few assumptions for this thought experiment:
 1) The distribution of Emacs used will be the vanilla GNU Emacs. No Doom Emacs, no Spacemacs, etc. 
 2) The newest versions of GNU Emacs can be used (Emacs 27, Emacs 28, Emacs 29).
 3) Only built-in features of Emacs can be used. Packages that would only work on Emacs cannot be installed from anywhere, including Melpa, Non-GNU Elpa, and even GNU Elpa. 
 4) Software that is independent of Emacs can be installed. A pdf reader or a Ruby interpreter, for example, could be installed if necessary. 
 5) The configuration file can be changed in any way so long as the previous rules are followed.

 During my Christmas break, I thought I would learn more about the wonderful world of Emacs. I thought tweaking my personal window management might have been a good place to start, however this is not working as I wanted it to...
 So I have 2 windows open and the point is on the right. If I run my function, I expected it to:
  
open the next buffer in the left window
 open the documentation in the left window
  
But nothing happens. I&#x27;ve added debugging to show that the function is being called, and it seems fine.
 Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>So I&#x27;m using the excellent Doom Emacs, and I use it for a wide array of things. Text editor, journal, calendar, and most importantly, as my Python IDE of choice.
 However, I still feel that my configuration is somewhat lacking for Python. I&#x27;m using python mode, the PYLS LSP server, and yas-snippet, yet I feel it&#x27;s still missing a lot of good features that IDEs like VS Code provide.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried many other things, like Eglot, Pyright, and Elpy, but they all come with many problems of their own. What packages would you recommend so I can make Emacs into a truly great IDE for Python?

 It doesn&#x27;t do much yet, just a bit more convenient way to browse Wiktionary entries. It lets you quickly send a request and see an entry without TOC and edit buttons.
 I&#x27;d like to add more features later.

# Poetry Is The Science Of The Real

Poetry is the &quot;science of the real&quot; (L249)

- Attention Is The Beginning Of Devotion [[202006230814]]
- A manner of living [[201912171125]]

Emerson advocated &quot;rearranged the prose into a poem.&quot; (L635) Turning prose into poetry is a real creative endeavor. Like we did on the forum post [“How long is a string?”]{https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/11834/#Comment_11834} rewriting a sentence that caught our attention by @MartinBB. Write the prose first, letting the words and images flow. Only afterward, morphing it into something poetic.

- Haiku In English Prose [[202002211200]]

### Reading Books
Dip into them
extract bits and pieces
move on
circle back
extract more
reinterpret
It&#x27;s all fairly messy.

&gt; @MartinBB said:
&gt; I dip into them, extract bits and pieces, move on (often because I have to), circle back to them, extract more, or reinterpret what I have already extracted. It is fairly messy.

- This would work in reverse also. We could write the poem first and then morph it into prose. As a list maker, this might be an advantageous way to work.

                              <span>I am wanting to edit an org mode table but I find elisp to be not to my liking at all, and putting in formulas for a table seems to be giving really weird errors (below). So I was wondering if it is possible to do it with any other language? 
 ​
 ​
 Weird error example:
 I have a three column table and the third columns formula is (if (&#x3D; $1 $2) $2) and it gives me an error saying it expects a value rather than the &#x3D; sign. I did the same thing with elisp and is ran just fine there. The two columns being called contain single digit integers.

 Every answer online regarding this issue tells me to copy glut32.dll to either my System32, my SysWOW64, or the same directory as the .hs file. I&#x27;ve done all three, but no dice.
 Why could my machine still be failing to utilize the .dll&#x27;s I&#x27;ve downloaded? Is there some extra step I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>I was trying to use the &#x27;any&#x27; function from Data.Vector.Fixed, but it seems to return true no matter what. This is an example of what I mean
 λ&gt; :set -XDataKinds -package fixed-vector λ&gt; import Data.Vector.Fixed as V λ&gt; import Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed as UV λ&gt; v &#x3D; V.fromList [4,1,2] :: UV.Vec 3 Int λ&gt; V.any ( V.any (&gt; 99) v True 
 The &#x27;all&#x27; function from that package works just fine so any condition I need I can reverse the logic and use that so the issue isn&#x27;t preventing me from getting anything done, but this seems like a bug to me so I thought I would ask here if anyone could see a good reason for this behavior. The source code for these functions calls C code, so there may be some funny business going on with that.
 I&#x27;m on GHC version 9.2.4 and I&#x27;m not specifying the version of the fixed-vector package, so I assume it is the most recent.

                              <span>I have a collection of items, e.g. a list of number, and an expensive operation. I want to pre-compute the operation for each of the items, so I can do cheap lookups repeatedly. For example:
 expensive :: Int -&gt; Int expensive &#x3D; (!! 1000000) . iterate (floor . sqrt . fromIntegral . (^2)) getAt :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Int getAt pre_computed index &#x3D; pre_computed !! index main :: IO () main &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [5,2,4,6] pre_computed &#x3D; map expensive xs for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt pre_computed) 
 That works as expected. Initially numbers are printed slowly but then fast later on.
 Now, I thought I can combine the pre-computing- and the lookup function into a single function like this:
 getAt :: [Int] -&gt; Int -&gt; Int getAt xs index &#x3D; pre_computed !! index where pre_computed &#x3D; map expensive xs main :: IO () main &#x3D; do let xs &#x3D; [5,2,4,6] for_ (cycle [0..length xs-1]) (print . getAt xs) 
 But this doesn&#x27;t work. Printing the numbers is always slow. My intuition was, that after partially applying getAt, it pretty much looks like this
 getAt&#x27; :: Int -&gt; Int getAt&#x27; index &#x3D; pre_computed !! index where pre_computed &#x3D; map expensive [5,2,4,6] 
 and then laziness makes sure that pre_computed is only computed once. After thinking about it more, I guess pre_computed is a local variable and not shared cross getAt calls. But shouldn&#x27;t Haskell be able to see that pre_computed does not depend on any of the arguments and optimize that away somehow?

                              <span>Async programming in Emacs is... challenging. If the modern asyncio/await/async paradigm represents &quot;cooperative&quot; multi-tasking, Emacs&#x27; async seems more &quot;semi-cooperative&quot;.
 I&#x27;m working with async process output in a comint mode, and I (re-)read the following docs often (emphasis added):
  
Output from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when reading terminal input (see the function waiting-for-user-input-p), in sit-for and sleep-for (see Waiting for Elapsed Time or Input), in accept-process-output (see Accepting Output from Processes), and in functions which send data to processes (see Sending Input to Processes). This minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel programming.
  
So it&#x27;s pretty clear that sit-for and accept-process-output are good &quot;yield points&quot; (ala await). But what about in functions which send data? Does that mean:
  
Only functions which directly call process-send-*?
 Any function which calls such a function (and so on up the call stack)?
  
And where exactly in such functions which send data can process-output interrupts happen? Anywhere? Only specific places? If you&#x27;ve been down this road and found any enlightenment, I&#x27;d be grateful to hear about your travels.

                              <span>I&#x27;d be grateful for any help with a problem I&#x27;ve had for a while. When I close Emacs, I always make sure to save every open buffer before I do so -- it&#x27;s an automatic reflex. Thus, the saved version of any given file will be the most current, and there should not be any need for autorecovery unless Emacs crashes without getting to save. Sometimes however, even after a normal close, my Emacs claims that a file has auto-save data, and prompts me to recover the file. If I recover the file and run a diff on it, I can see that the &quot;recovered&quot; file is actually an out-of-date version.
 Has anyone else encountered this, and could there something wrong with my config that&#x27;s causing Emacs to try to &quot;recover&quot; out-of-date files? Below are the lines that I think could be relevant from my config:
 (setq version-control t) (setq vc-make-backup-files t) (setq auto-save-interval 20) (setq kept-old-versions 0) (setq delete-old-versions t) (setq backup-by-copying t) (setq kept-new-versions 10) 
 Right now I&#x27;m on Emacs 28.2 on Apple M1, but I think this has been a problem I experienced on a past Linux machine as well, so I suspect the fault is with my config.

For people wondering what the parsing capabilities of tree-sitter will be, or maybe hacking on or planning for some emacs modes to make use of it, I found the very helpful tree-sitter playground. Pick your language, enter some test code, click around. It&#x27;s really impressive.

                              <span>I was using emacs-mac because it has precise text selection when using a mouse. But I like just about everything more building with emacs-plus, seems much more stable being closer to source. So I am using emacs-plus now but when selecting text with a mouse, it is quite imprecise. It will show you have characters selected while clicking down and when you release the click it will often add one character more to the selection. Is there any setting to fix this or is it more low level that a build has to fix it like emacs-mac did? Thanks!

                              <span>I know emacs isn&#x27;t supposed to be super snappy, but it is ridiculously slow, to the point where I&#x27;m convinced that I&#x27;ve done something terribly wrong. It&#x27;s just a little slow on startup and gets progressively worse and is borderline unusable after about half an hour.
 All my packages are natively compiled. (From nix) I&#x27;m using lsp-mode with haskell-language-server. It&#x27;s also bad with rust-analyzer, but not as bad. It affects all versions I&#x27;ve tried, including latest master and the lsp-mode experimental fork (which improved stuff but broke direnv, so...) I&#x27;ve tried the default gc limit, a high limit, a manual idle timeout and gcmh. It&#x27;s much snappier in the terminal, but still not as good as I want it (and the whole gui thing was the reason I tried to switch away from neovim).
 So now I&#x27;m convinced that there&#x27;s no way you all live with this and that I must&#x27;ve done something really stupid.
 Here&#x27;s (the relevant parts of) my config: https://github.com/SKyletoft/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs https://github.com/SKyletoft/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.d/configs/language-specifics.el

Neither :straight t, nor setq straight-use-package-by-default works and Emacs complains about a bunch of missing definitions when compiling init.el (I know this is somewhat expected, but it happens with extremely simple to load packages, like company). I&#x27;m using GNU Emacs 28.2-r4, if that matters.

                              <span>This post may end up rambling a little but I&#x27;ll try to keep it short.
 I decided to try doing a vanilla Emacs config again; I usually use Doom. I&#x27;ve tried this before with moderate success, but I felt like starting from scratch would be refreshing and allow me to craft things more carefully.
 I made a concerted effort not to add things I don&#x27;t understand fully or that I will never actually use. I also decided not to use evil or try to ape all the Doom keybindings like I did with my previous attempt.
 Fast forward to today; the result is this.
 I&#x27;m actually quite satisfied with it; the code meets my goals of consisting of fully self-contained use-package statements, which in my inexpert opinion is a nice way of making the code as stable and idiot-proof (me) as possible.

                              <span>I just upgraded from Fedora 36 to Fedora 37, and when I tried executing emacsclient, it would immediately crash. emacs-nox worked fine however.
 I removed the binary and tried re-installing emacs from the Fedora package repository, but the same thing would happen.
 I then tried recompiling emacs-28, and I get this cryptic message when running ../configure:
  config.status: error: cannot find input file: &#x60;test/manual/noverlay/Makefile.in 
 Google-fu gives exactly one hit when searching for test/manual/noverlay/Makefile.in and it&#x27;s for someone having trouble compiling emacs on Apple M1; in my case I&#x27;m using boring intel x86 (thinkpad x480).
 I&#x27;m not really sure where to begin to look to debug exactly what&#x27;s going on. For what it&#x27;s worth, when trying to compile emacs-29, I can get past the configuration, but when I actually try compiling it, it&#x27;s tells me I&#x27;m missing a ton of object files, namely, the following:  scroll.o category.o chartab.o com.o cmds.o casetab.o region-cache.o doprnt.o lcms.o systhread.o terminfo.o lastfile.o  Has anyone had any issues with emacs on Fedora 37? This only seems to be the case on my thinkpad; on my desktop it&#x27;s running fine.

                              <span>For the smooth integration I am using Cygwin (with w32 Emacs for native UI + copy/paste). But its fork is slow, especially with corporate antivirus.
 In the past I used NT Emacs with Cygwin and in order to make hg work I created an executable wrapper that re-invoke the command stripping .exe extension:
 https://hg.defun.work/utils/file/tip/cygwin/cygrun/cygrun.c
 Because hg is a Python script in Cygwin! And this is not enough: I set CYGWIN&#x3D;&quot;noglob&quot;, otherwise braces are removed from expression --template {rev}, see https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/cygwin/2011-11/msg00225.html
 Now I face the same issue with MSYS2: hg is a Python script so Windows apps (фтв ТЕ Уьфсі ші) cannot directly call it... What would you do to marry NT Emacs and MSYS2?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have something like this in my doom emacs config.el file:
 (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates &#x27;((&quot;d&quot; &quot;default&quot; entry &quot;* Section 1\n** Section 1.1\n* Section 2\n&quot; :target (file+head &quot;%.org&quot; &quot;#+title: %\n&quot;)))) 
 And this will pre-write the &quot;* Section 1\n** Section 1.1\n* Section 2\n&quot; string into every new daily capture that I make. 
 I would like to use a template file instead of this, so that every time I capture a daily it will pre-write whatever is in some &quot;template.org&quot; file. 
 I have searched everywhere for an answer but I can&#x27;t seem to find any.
 I appreciate any help

 I parenthetically indicated how many tabs I used in the list, and you can clearly see that the spacing is different. How can I fix this?

                              <span>Kinda short version: I use docker-compose for local development with JS and TypeScript. Decided to experiment and move everything into docker - nothing mounted from the host or running on the host except emacs. Got that working, thanks to docker-tramp. Projectile, magit, eglot, lsp-mode — all of them run. It feels super snappy. eMacs codespaces, minus the browser.
 HOWEVER my bliss lasts few minutes as very quickly I get “forbidden reeentrant call” error from tramp and eglot runs out of sync and gives me irrelevant errors. This is caused by some change tramp did for eMacs 28. There are tickets for this explaining in detail, but both lsp-mode and eglot haven’t resolved it (and it may be company-mode bug). I’m not expert on tramp and lsp, so debugging that would be big effort investment for me.
 Anyone using lsp server + tramp on daily basis and have dealt with this?

 Who should apply?
 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (3 to 5 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
 Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (3 to 5 per month).
 Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.

                              <span>[Rookie Servant question]
 Hi all! I&#x27;ve got a REST API in Servant with a resource (/resA/:id) and many subresources (/resA/:id/resB/:id, /resA/:id/resC/:id, etc.) and a database that stores information on which users have access to which resources. I&#x27;m using basic authentication to authenticate users.
 I want to restrict access to the subresources of resA so that one only can access e.g. /resA/1/... if one has access to resA/1. Currently I do this by manually checking for access in every endpoint handler under resA, which doesn&#x27;t feel like a good solution since this check must be added for every new endpoint I add under resA.
 This should be a common scenario for real world APIs, but I haven&#x27;t found any documentation explaning how to deal with this. Any advice on how to propely restrict access as described above with Servant? Can this be done at the type level, or can I somehow check for access &quot;outside&quot; of the endpoints&#x27; handlers?
 Happy to be directed to any blog posts / documentation about this!

 My assignment is to build a data constructor that basically works like a tupel, but on a tree. I need to build a data constructor for a tree that has ANY number of children per Node.
 (&quot;Give the definition of an algebraic data type GTree for trees in which each inner node can have any number of children and describe your procedure.&quot;)
 I already built one with e.g. 3 children per Node: But how do I build any number of children (not 4, 5, or 10 but ANY at the same time). Thanks in advance and have a nice christmas.
 data GTree a &#x3D; GNil | GNode a (GTree a) (GTree a) (GTree a) deriving Show testGTree &#x3D; GNode 4 (GNode 5 GNil GNil GNil) (GNode 6 GNil GNil GNil) (GNode 7 GNil GNil GNil)

I&#x27;ve been trying to set up a minimal example according to the book, but it&#x27;s resulting in a timeout:  HttpExceptionRequest Request { host &#x3D; &quot;accounts.google.com&quot; port &#x3D; 443 secure &#x3D; True requestHeaders &#x3D; [(&quot;Content-Type&quot;,&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;)] path &#x3D; &quot;/o/oauth2/token&quot; queryString &#x3D; &quot;&quot; method &#x3D; &quot;POST&quot; proxy &#x3D; Nothing rawBody &#x3D; False redirectCount &#x3D; 10 responseTimeout &#x3D; ResponseTimeoutDefault requestVersion &#x3D; HTTP/1.1 proxySecureMode &#x3D; ProxySecureWithConnect } ConnectionTimeout 
 I tried using yesod-auth-oauth2 instead, but I still got a timeout error:  HttpExceptionRequest Request { host &#x3D; &quot;www.googleapis.com&quot; port &#x3D; 443 secure &#x3D; True requestHeaders &#x3D; [(&quot;Content-Type&quot;,&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;),(&quot;Authorization&quot;,&quot;&quot;),(&quot;User-Agent&quot;,&quot;hoauth2&quot;),(&quot;Accept&quot;,&quot;application/json&quot;)] path &#x3D; &quot;/oauth2/v3/token&quot; queryString &#x3D; &quot;&quot; method &#x3D; &quot;POST&quot; proxy &#x3D; Nothing rawBody &#x3D; False redirectCount &#x3D; 10 responseTimeout &#x3D; ResponseTimeoutDefault requestVersion &#x3D; HTTP/1.1 proxySecureMode &#x3D; ProxySecureWithConnect } ConnectionTimeout 
 Trying with the Python Flask version on Google&#x27;s website for the same OAuth works, so I am wondering if YesodAuth is broken. I am using LTS 20.3.

                              <span>background: i want to make a game and do so with minimal effort there are some options to do so i chose gi-gtk for all menus and cairo to draw anything more complex, gtk has a class called builder which uses a xml file to make a user interface in this file you can specify the name of handlers for signals so i created a simple main.ui which had a button and in this button i added a signal handler.
 first time i ran it complained that there wasn&#x27;t a signal handler for the click which makes sense as my function is not a c global symbol.;
 i then used addCallbackSymbol to add my function as a signal handler however when i do so although it does call my function it also causes a segmentation fault.

                              <span>Hi folks!
 Noob question here - I have some time data in the following structure:
 - Time column in the format: &quot;&quot;%FT%TZ&quot; - ie. &quot;2022-08-12T16:00:00Z&quot; (always UTC)
 - Timezone column in the format: &quot;America/New_York&quot;, etc
 And I need to parse that into a &quot;ZonedTime&quot; and later convert it to other timezones (using the same timezone format) - ie Europe/London.
 I couldn&#x27;t find a package to do so and the tz formats in the Time package seem to be the three letters only (as far as I can tell...)
 Is there any way of doing so in the time package I&#x27;m not seeing? or any other package to do so?

                              <span>Hello
 I&#x27;m studying Haskell at the moment and stumbled upon a program I wasn&#x27;t sure how it worked. It involved the following the lambda expression:
 data Server &#x3D; MkServer Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) data Report &#x3D; MkReport Domain [Email] deriving (Eq, Show) map (\(MkServer domain emails) -&gt; MkReport domain (filter ((/&#x3D;) domain . emailDomain) emails)) 
 I am aware about how lambda expressions work, but I&#x27;m unsure about:
 1. how this lambda expression spawns two arguments for map
 2. the dot is a function composition but how exactly is it applied in this case?
 3. on what arguments is filter applied?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get emacs to automatically use the Agda input mode whenever I load an Agda file. I currently have the following in my config.el: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elisp (add-hook &#x27;agda2-mode-hook &#x27;(lambda () ; If you do not want to use any input method: (message &quot;DEBUG setting Agda method&quot;) (set-input-method &#x27;Agda) ))
 &#x60;&#x60; TheDEBUGmessage appears in the Messages buffer, so the hook is running, but any time I open a new Agda file, the input mode isnil, and I have to manually callset-input-method&#x60;.
 Is this the wrong way to set the input method for a specific mode? If not, is there a way to debug this, so I can see why the input method isn&#x27;t getting set, or if something is un-setting it?

                              <span>At the end of the year, I am happy to announce the stable Vertico 1.0 and Marginalia 1.0 releases. Vertico is a minimalist, yet flexible and responsive vertical completion UI. Marginalia provides helpful annotations for many completion contexts. Both packages have been solid for a while but I rather let things mature slowly. These releases finally put the stamp &quot;stable&quot; on these two packages. I expect the other members of the package suite to follow soon after. Both packages have been updated recently to support the newest Emacs 29 features. They are compatible with Emacs 27, 28 and the upcoming 29.
 I got a lot of positive and constructive feedback over the last two years and the packages have seen some growing adoption in the community. This is all very encouraging. I learned about many different subsystems and packages through your feedback and given the ubiquity of completion in Emacs. Thank you, Emacs community!
 If my packages make your daily Emacs live better, please consider sponsoring me on GitHub Sponsors. I plan to develop and maintain my packages in the long term. I am the author of Vertico and Marginalia is co-authored by /u/oantolin and me. Take a look at minad&#x27;s sponsor page and oantolin&#x27;s sponsor page.
 If you have questions or feedback I am happy to hear!

 My first implementation of yaml-pro used an elisp yaml parser which was really slow. In the latest version of yaml-pro, I&#x27;ve re-implemented all of the features to use the new Emacs tree-sitter integration. Not only was it much easier to implement, but the resulting code also runs much faster and can handle syntax errors. Also, I was able to get eldoc and imenu support in using tree-sitter.

 If I select a word and use mc/mark-next-like-this, then all instances are selected and multiple cursors appear. I can delete multiple instances like this, but when I try to type new text, only one cursor flashes and the typed text appears only at the first cursor. What am I doing wrong?

 (file-dependents (feature-file &#x27;cl))
 To identify the culprit.
 I am using EMACS 28.1 with ESS. It is unclear to me how to evaluate these commands. I can get loadhist via &quot; ‘C-h v load-history’ &quot; but then I do not know how to evaluate
 (file-dependents (feature-file &#x27;cl)).
 ​
 I am sure this is a noob question, but any help would be great.

                              <span>Tumblesocks doesn&#x27;t work for me. On WSL with GNU Emacs 28.2 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.35, cairo version 1.16.0) of 2022-12-20, modified by Debian tumblesocks-api-test-auth generates a nil token. The URL is: https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token&#x3D;nil. elpa gives me the following dependencies: oauth-20130128.151, htmlize-20210825.2150, markdown-mode-20221105.236. I read https://billisalive.tumblr.com/ and https://danzorx.tumblr.com/post/36832512247/a-weird-oauth-el-issue-when-trying-to-set-up but couldn&#x27;t get tumblesocks to work :/ 
 Anyone else experiencing the same? Google doesn&#x27;t provide much.

 I follow that with my options and an org-mode time stamp, as follows:
 
 I noticed however that there is also a #+date: option. Why would I want to use this instead of a simple timestamp, and what would the format need to be?

                              <span>I am checking out Emacs wiki https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UnitTesting but uncertain whether info is actual. What I expect from framework is to be similar to pytest. And definitely I against writing unit tests in Markdown like in Buttercup as: there is no Lisp completion for such unit tests out of the box and highlighting. By all means maybe there are any plugins fixing this issue with Markdown code blocks but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best option to utilize markdown as a unit test source.

 As you can see, the lsp-ui tooltip uses this ugly font rather than my preferred font. How can I fix this? I can&#x27;t find the face which dictates the lsp-ui tooltip.

                              <span>Hi, so I&#x27;ve been trying to solve this problem all day, I&#x27;m learning about connecting to databases in scala and I&#x27;ve got stuck. My colleague who is tutoring me has no problem running this on his laptop with the postgres db in a docker container. Yet mine won&#x27;t load the config file for some reason.
 I have a basic tutorial example that I did thankst to RTJVM and that works fine, but it is very basic and just connects. Here however, no such joy. 
 So far, the docker container gets spun up, and the database table with correct columns and headers gets created, but for some reason it then fails to write to the database. I can&#x27;t see anything in the logs, I just have this stack trace and I can&#x27;t read it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to say much:

                              <span>Hi there, It seems that I am running scala 2 in intellj when I&#x27;m supposed to be running scala3, but I have no idea how to choose between the two is there a way to do it easily. I just don&#x27;t know enough about java to know if this is a big rebuild of just a switch somewhere, I know I have both here on my Mac, that I&#x27;m certain of, but going from one to the other, I&#x27;m not so sure about. 
 Any pointers or docs that would explain it would be appreciated,

                              <span>A new maintainer for org-caldav has been found and a big update was published this week to sync tasks/todo&#x27;s:
https://github.com/dengste/org-caldav
With this, you can have your plain text todo files and appointments (in Emacs + org-mode) and sync with a proper Calendar service/app -- e.g. &quot;make stuff appear on your mobile devices&quot;. Then you can also have your regular Calendar app prompt you to get going before appointments by all the buzzing and beeping you&#x27;d usually expect. The origin of the information is outside of your calendar app, though, in Emacs. Which may or may not be your cup of tea 
You can now, from the &quot;&quot;&quot;comfort&quot;&quot;&quot; of Emacs and your org-mode files, sync all this stuff to a &quot;CalDav&quot; server. That means: basically every mail + calendar server, including Google&#x27;s, though I&#x27;ll be trying iCloud and Nextcloud.
The tool exports all your .org info to iCalendar files (.ical) and then syncs these with a server. It&#x27;s a two way sync, so you also get new entries for calendar events you&#x27;ve created.
At the end of the process, org-caldav acts as a bridge between your plain text stuff and your normal Calendar + Todo stuff.
Apple users beware: don&#x27;t expect this to &quot;just work&quot; with Reminders, though. From work, I know that the Reminders app is basically a glorified hack. I&#x27;ll report back when I find out anything substantial about this.</span>

                              <span>One common complaint from industrial users of Haskell is that of compilation times: they are sometimes painfully slow. Some of that slowness is difficult to avoid—no matter how you slice it, typechecking and optimizing Haskell code takes a lot of work—but nobody would argue that there is not ample room for improvement. For the past few months, Krzysztof Gogolewski and I have had the opportunity to work with Mercury to identify what some of those improvements might be, and I am pleased to report that our first major patch toward that end will be part of GHC 9.6.
For readers who just want the numbers, we’ve seen a 2–3% reduction in compile times and a 5–10% reduction in allocations, on average, for unoptimized builds,1 measured on a few large Haskell codebases. Due to the nature of the patch…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Since around a month I started to have horrible performance with AucTeX + Helm and I have no idea how to debug it. I am on Windows 10 using native Emacs 28.2.
 After a minute or so of opening a TeX file and enabling AucTeX any helm command slows down to a crawl. Even the standard &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;helm-M-x&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; takes ages to update (approx 2 sec per keypress), typing quickly leads to dropped letters, etc. 
 This happens ONLY with AucTeX. I tried profiling but the profiler does not work as expected. Below is the result of runnning the profiler for 2 minutes! It has 1 sample. This never happened to me. How should I debug this?

                              <span>At work we are using RHEL 8. I do not have root access. I have asked and will not be given root access. RHEL 8 has emacs 26.1 installed and I want to use a more up to date version.
 The platform does not have most of the source libraries installed. The configure step of compiling emacs from source fails due to a variety of missing dependencies. Each time I try to build one of them, another one is missing. This seems like a deep rabbit hole to go down that will take a lot of time.
 Is there a way to statically link the emacs binary when building on another machine and move it over to the RHEL8 machines? 
 Is there any other way to get a more modern version of emacs on these machines?

 I have a situation where I&#x27;d like to automate something with TRAMP but my Elisp-fu is pretty weak. I can kinda read it and usually figure out what&#x27;s going on, but that&#x27;s a bit different from getting the thing to work.
 We have embedded development units with a little miniature network inside them for communications. I need to do dired (and ultimately file editing, but dired is a fine jumping off point) on files on the second hop. The second IP address is always the same, however the first can vary within our local network, and depending on which box we&#x27;re shelling into. So for example a working argument to dired looks like:
 /plink:root@10.20.20.5|ssh:root@192.168.1.1:/ 
 And this will give me the directory at the root filesystem on the second hop. The 192.168.1.1 address is always the same (it&#x27;s inside the box) but the 10.20.20.5 might vary at the 5 depending on which box, and which IP address DHCP picked up that day when it powered on.
 Ideally it would just interactively ask me for the first address and then execute dired on the full string as I&#x27;m fine with using that as a starting point for editing the scripts and whatnot that end up on the machine.
 Anyone Elisp fluent who might point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance. I&#x27;ve read a lot on the Elisp programming manuals and such, but getting from the language to doing something functionally useful more than basic addition or something has eluded me thus far.

                              <span>I have customized the variable org-agenda-custom-commands as shown below. Currently, the classic approach &quot;General tasks (simple version)&quot; and my custom approach &quot;General tasks (complicated version)&quot; both do the same thing (and this works well). What I&#x27;m trying to do is that I would like the whole section &quot;General tasks (complicated version)&quot; to be gone if there are no NEXT/WAIT tasks in the associated file (notes.org).
 The problem that I have is that once the variable org-agenda-custom-commands is evaluated initially (when Emacs launches), the if block decides if the section will be displayed or not. Further changes to notes.org will not change the behavior of org-agenda-custom-commands since its if block has already been evaluated. However, manually re-evaluating org-agenda-custom-comma…</span>

                              <span>I flip between any number of window manager workspaces and any one of those workspaces could have an Emacs frame and a browser. When asking elfeed or Org Mode to open a link in a browser, it sure would be nice if I could have any browser sharing the workspace with the current Emacs frame handle that URL! As it stands now, the URL will open in a tab in whatever was the last browser window that had focus and that could be on any of, like, 10 workspaces.
 Anyone solved this problem? Or have any thoughts about how one might solve this problem?
 My guess is that its going to require some interactions with the window manager in order to query the applications in the current workspace and then find a brower. In this case the WM is i3wm.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;v been using vterm for a while now, and I just discovered what &quot;directory tracking&quot; is. How I understood is that Emacs should be aware of what directory I&#x27;m currently inside in vterm, so   should by default show the files in the current directory---but it&#x27;s not working!
 I&#x27;ve followed the steps shown in the README: sh vterm_printf() { if [ -n &quot;$TMUX&quot; ] &amp;&amp; ([ &quot;${TERM%%-*}&quot; &#x3D; &quot;tmux&quot; ] || [ &quot;${TERM%%-*}&quot; &#x3D; &quot;screen&quot; ]); then # Tell tmux to pass the escape sequences through printf &quot;\ePtmux;\e\e]%s\007\e\\&quot; &quot;$1&quot; elif [ &quot;${TERM%%-*}&quot; &#x3D; &quot;screen&quot; ]; then # GNU screen (screen, screen-256color, screen-256color-bce) printf &quot;\eP\e]%s\007\e\\&quot; &quot;$1&quot; else printf &quot;\e]%s\e\\&quot; &quot;$1&quot; fi } vterm_prompt_end() { vterm_printf &quot;51;A$(whoami)@$(hostname):$(pwd)&quot; } setopt PROMPT_SUBST PROMPT&#x3D;$PROMPT&#x27;%{$(vterm_prompt_end)%}&#x27;  I have the above at the end of my .zshrc; but it is simply not working.
 Do I need some additional setup in the Emacs side, or did I correctly understand what &quot;directory tracking&quot; and it is not working for me?
 While writing this post, I began to suspect that maybe ivy is messing things up?
 Thanks!

 Following up on my recent talk at EmacsConf (youtube| toobnix| Q&amp;A), we are prototyping a new economic system in the open source community, and your participation is essential!
 What: The First Congress for Attribution-Based Economics. In a nutshell, we will be meeting to appraise participating open source projects as a result of which any financial contributions to these projects will be fairly distributed to contributors and antecedents according to the proportions of value that we agree on.
 When: Let&#x27;s pick a good day - please take the poll here: https://forms.gle/LD7RAjRAdTGoBFJBA
 Where: Online at this gather.town (no signup necessary): https://app.gather.town/app/aoo9sjeCeRnN1dhu/abe-congress
 We&#x27;ll meet by the fountain.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious about why (fringe-mode 2) is so relatively slow. It adds about half a second to my init time. My solution is (run-with-idle-timer 1 nil (lambda () (fringe-mode 2))) and works well enough for my needs, but I don&#x27;t understand why removing fringes would take so long? Edit: to be clear, I mean that just putting (fringe-mode 2) on the init file is slow. The solution with the timer was to delay the execution until after init.

After a round or two of these switches, Emacs fonts start to look ugly, see this pic for the contrast (the top window is a fresh emacs, while the bottom one has been through monitor switches).
 Has anyone seen the same problem, and more importantly found a solution for it?

                              <span>I was searching for some examples of rx usage and came cross this blog post http://francismurillo.github.io/2017-02-15-Project-Script-Loader.
 It mentions these functions -
 projectile-project-p, projectile-project-root, project-project-name and locate-dominating-file.
 I&#x27;ve been needing these functions and even forgotten how much I need them.
 On the site there is also this - http://francismurillo.github.io/2016-08-02-An-Unique-Projectile-Completion/, which has an implementation of something I&#x27;ve always wanted in find-file, displaying the file name before the path.

                              <span>Sorry it might be a silly question, but I&#x27;m thinking of buying Macbook air M1, 16g ram and 1tb ssd, just because I like the gold color and I&#x27;m on my budget.
 I used to be a Scala developer back then but the last shop used (horrible) window vm machine with 64gb ram, and it was extremely slow, especially when compiling.
 Now i&#x27;ll probably get a job from Scala world again soon but I&#x27;m worried that macbook air is ok for scala development or not.
 Probably the future employer will give me whatever machine they have but maybe I need my own machine if I work as a freelancer.
 One extra monitor is Ok but if I need to use docker or something then M1 air might not be enough.
 If M1 air is not tolerable, then I will probably get a Macbook Pro.
 Any advice or thoughts? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have the following question on the List Monad that does a filtering while unboxing in the do notation.
 Here is an example ... unboxing the list returns only the sublists with 2 members, thus rejects all other sublists with length not 2
 f :: [[Int]] -&gt; [(Int, Int)] f xss &#x3D; do [a, b]  f [[2, 2], [3], [4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]] [(2,2),(4,5)] 
 If I desugarize the do notation I have to use a case statement explicitly to pattern match on the list length and use the &#x27;fail&#x27; like this
 f :: [[Int]] -&gt; [(Int, Int)] f xss &#x3D; xss &gt;&gt;&#x3D; \xs -&gt; case xs of [a, b] -&gt; return (a, b) _ -&gt; fail &quot;not two members&quot; 
 So my question is where does Haskell hide the magic that [a, b] &lt;- xss should use a case with a fail?
 Any ideas or help is appreciated.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a relatively small cabal project and I use GitLab CI for a runner inside my university&#x27;s GitLab instance for automated builds, tests, haddock generation and finally haddock hosting on GitLab pages. The whole process is based on one of the official haskell dockerhub images. This seems to be a clean and well-defined pipeline and it works fine.
 Recently I needed to add a pandoc library dependency to my cabal file which led to pipeline runtimes of more than 30 minutes. What&#x27;s the cleanest way to accelerate this? Is it possible to let my CI pipeline depend on a different image with pandoc (the library, not the executable) pre-installed? Using the same image but with &#x60;RUN cabal install pandoc&#x60; didn&#x27;t help, my &#x60;cabal build&#x60; just tells me again it needs to build it.

                              <span>If I understand the new GHCJS backend correctly, it diverges from the normal compilation pipeline at STG (see the new StgToJS module subtree). Wouldn&#x27;t that make it an excellent candidate to use GHC-WPC&#x27;s machine-readable external STG representation, instead of hooking it directly into the GHC source tree?
 Beside decreasing the maintenance burden on GHC, this would also give Cabal/Stack support to GHCJS for free; whereas GHCJS as-is doesn&#x27;t support either yet. 
 Now, of course, maybe there are changes to GHC that are needed even before STG (after all, the GHCJS commit does touch other parts of GHC), but those would be fairly lightweight without the rts and StgToJS parts, and maybe could even be a good opportunity to generalize them for other future alternative backends.

 Longer Tale I&#x27;ve been bouncing between several time zones lately and its made some of my scheduling in org-mode a bit problematic w/o timezones. At the moment, I guess standard timestamps are set as . However, I need to start having org understand TZs and make sure org-agenda is aware.
 The only thing I could find on this was stack overflow post suggesting the following:

                              <span>I have switched over somewhat recently to org-mode with the goal of going all in on it for my productivity. 
 I&#x27;m following a few of the staples in my learning journal (norang and voit). It&#x27;s all been great but I am trying to wrap my head around project management of more complex personal projects. Namely my tabletop game design. 
 Long story short I&#x27;m trying to build up a workflow for my designs that incorporate some literate design files among other things. The ultimate goal of these projects are to be go from ideation to publication
  
Ideation
 Prototyping
 Playtesting 
 Development
 publishing
  
As a result these will be multi-directory many file projects. I&#x27;ve also been learning webdev on the side and have been using projectile to manage those projects.
 To all the expert org-mode users here, do you see any issues or pitfalls with trying to pair org-mode and projectile? Below is a rough outline of how I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use it. 
 I think I&#x27;ll probably use several org files for the project itself but have 1 project management file. 
  
Project.org - the file for tasks and scheduling playtests. This would be the file added to my &quot;org-agenda-files-alist&quot; and captured into my normal agenda views etc. 
 README.org - git overview
 Design.org - main design doc
 Design-Journal.org - notes I capture along the way for publishing a post-mortem
 Playtests.org - Playtest data
 Rules.org - official rules document used for playtesting and eventually publishing

I&#x27;d be happy if you check the translation and see if I screwed something up.
The priority of the translation is accessability of his thoughts. So, I did aim for a compromise of adhering to Luhmann&#x27;s style and styling the grammar to a more accessable way. Luhmann is exeptionally difficult to read and translating doesn&#x27;t help..
German differs more from English than one might expect:

  
French is a fine park, Italian a big, bright, colorful wood. But German is almost a primeval forest, so dense and mysterious, so without a passage and yet with a thousand paths. You can&#x27;t get lost in a park, and not so easily and dangerously in the bright Italian wood; but in the German jungle, within four, f…</span>

                              <span>Good morning, I am new to Haskell and just recently started learning it. I have been stuck on an error for 3 days and can&#x27;t seem to resolve the error. I was hoping someone from this community could help assist me, I have looked at a lot of examples but still don&#x27;t understand why. I come from C# with 6 years of experience under my belt, irrelevant but I am not completely new to programming.

                              <span>I am quite new to the FP so this Could be a stupid question. Please pardon if so.
 Is there a way to have multiple implementations for the same function in Haskell? So the compiler can pick the optimal one depending on the architecture of the hardware.

                              <span>I am really excited to try emacs-29 but my principal work machine is a 2020 MBP with an Apple Silicon M1 chip. My everyday emacs is 27.1 which I installed through homebrew, and that seems to be the updated version. The usual sites that have pre-built binaries for the Mac (e.g. emacsformacosx.com) are still on 28.2.
 After some searching I found a few recommendations for emacs-plus:
 brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus brew install emacs-plus@29 --with-native-comp --with-modern-doom3-icon 
 Unfortunately that did not build on my machine and I have run out of options to try and trying to figure out the different issues. It does apparently work on some machines, but the explanations and workarounds have not really revealed themselves as far as I can tell.
 I may just need to be patient, but I thought I would ask in case anyone has a tip or trick that they could share. I&#x27;m just very interested in experimenting with the new SQLite functionality.
 Thanks and regards.

 There is a way to only eval this code:
 &#x60;(add-to-list &#x27;eglot-server-programs &#x27;((js-mode typescript-mode) . (eglot-deno &quot;deno&quot; &quot;lsp&quot;)))&#x60;
 If the project has a &#x60;deno.json&#x60; file?

                              <span>Hey-o. I&#x27;m quite happy using my standard Emacs keybindings. But when I need to assign a new key binding for a single command, I suffer from having too many options.
 So what are your strategies for choosing sensible keybindings?
 I&#x27;ll start - I&#x27;ve found function keys to be invaluable when wanting to enter a package with its own menu. F3 for org-agenda or F8 for deft. It may be an obvious application of the function keys, but it was a pattern that I had to independently discover.

 I&#x27;ve been reading that a lot of people are moving from company to corfu. Have you been able to make this work for lsp-mode ? If so, any configs/snippets I can look at.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So I took the plunge and upgraded to emacs29. Smooth so far, just having trouble getting tree-sitter to work.
 I&#x27;ve downloaded and generated the libraries for the various languages from:
 https://github.com/casouri/tree-sitter-module
 Then I copied all of them from dist to /usr/local/bin, and set the treesitter load path, and checked that tree-sitter can see them
 (require &#x27;treesit) (treesit-available-p) ;; t (setq treesit-extra-load-path &#x27;(&quot;/usr/local/lib&quot;)) ;; open a javascript document to test. (treesit-ready-p &#x27;javascript) ;; t 
 My javascript document only has the JavaScript (major?) mode, but I&#x27;m not getting any error messages or anything when I type invalid statements.
 Is there something I&#x27;m missing? Do I also need to install the tree-sitter package and enable (global-tree-sitter-mode)?
 Where is tree-sitter-hl-mode in the native implementation?

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to run and get the result of a command on a remote host with SSH connection, after having activated a virtual env.
 In a terminal, I usually do
 local $ ssh remote remote $ source venv/bin/activate remote (venv) $ midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid 
 How can I do the same in Emacs, with a single command? Ideally, I would like to get the output of the commands as well.
 After reading the documentation of TRAMP, I decided that start-file-process or shell-command would be the functions I need. I tried this.
 (let ((default-directory &quot;/sshx:remote:~/&quot;)) (start-file-process &quot;tramp-remote&quot; (get-buffer-create &quot;*Tramp remote process*&quot;) &quot;/bin/bash&quot; &quot;-c&quot; &quot;source ~/venv/bin/activate ; midi2wav.py file-on-remote-host.mid&quot;)) 
 But nothing appears in the buffer &quot;Tramp remote process&quot;. There are many other commands for running a program in Emacs, like call-process, process-file, etc, but I am a bit lost in which can be used here.
 Thanks for help!

                              <span>Anyone that uses windows, would you mind sharing your experience with emacs running natively, not using a vm or wsl. Is there any significant performance differencece in comparison to that on a unix system. 
 Expect auctex, haskell mode and markdown-mode + a theme i don&#x27;t use any other packages, so i think there wouldnt be an issue package-wise.
 Any input on the subject is well appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a fast typist, and I can feel there is a lag in typing and responsiveness in Emacs. I know it&#x27;s probably a package or something I&#x27;m doing that&#x27;s causing it, but where do start tracking this down? I don&#x27;t mind it when I&#x27;m writing code, but it&#x27;s a bit distracting when I&#x27;m typing prose or a journal.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using global-auto-revert-mode which updates a buffer automatically when it is changed externally. But if there is any unsaved changes in the buffer and the file is modified externally there is not even a message letting me know it is modified so I can be making changes and don&#x27;t know it is modified until I try to save. Is there a way to change this maybe to be more vim-like? Or is there a workflow here that I&#x27;m not understanding. Thanks.

                              <span>I have customized my org-mode to have a variable pitch font by default, but fixed-pitch font for text in a org-block, that is text between #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC. As expected, when one specifies a language emacs and babel already know about this works as well
 However, when I use an &quot;external&quot; language (for example Nim via the ob-nim package) emacs doesn&#x27;t recognize the block as a src-block face and it uses the variable-pitch font and I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;m stuck on this problem 
 I have checked the package is installed correctly and I have loaded the package correctly, since I can run and eval code blocks using C-c C-c with absolutely zero problems 
 Here&#x27;s some screenshots for emacs-lisp, working 
 working! fixed pitch + highlighting
 and for nim, not working 
 variable pitch :(

                              <span>In the thread &quot;Fallback Search for Zettels...&quot; from @micahredding, @Will presents another Keyboard Maestro macro. It&#x27;s really impressive, but I don&#x27;t like Keyboard Maestro at all. I checked it out and it kind of overwhelms me. Same to Alfred, by the way.
I prefer the keep-it-simple approach. When I want to link to a file somewhere on my filesystem, I do the following:
I add a unique ID to the end of the filename, e. g. This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf
Wherever I want to link to this file, I simply write: [This is a sample file 20221220090709.pdf] or something like: see the paper I wrote once [20221220090709]
To follow the link, I simply copy the UID to the search in Finder which only takes seconds.  The UID allows me to change the filename later without breaking the link. Using single brackets make these links distinguishable to &quot;real&quot; links within the zettelkasten. The UID has two digits more than my normal zettelkasten UIDs which is another criterion for differentiation (and it allows me to rename more than one file per minute).
I have been doing it this way for a couple of months now and it has been working so far. What do you think of this approach?</span>
